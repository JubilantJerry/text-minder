So....
So you wanna start all over?
Great idea.
All right.
I'll go outside, and I'll come right back in.
D.J.:
Okay.
[KNOCKING]
Ta-da, ta-da!
Greetings from Baltimore.
Hi, Steve.
What happened to your braces, glasses and zits?
Oh, um.
All gone.
Isn't nature great?
Hey, I got a great idea.
What do you say we go ice skating?
No, that's for little kids.
- But if you really wanna go....
- Yeah.

Okay, Michelle, your grandma's gonna make you an outfit.
We have to get your measurements.
- Hold her arms up, Joey.
- Okay.
Reach for the sky, Michelle.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist those cute little pits of yours.
All right, here we go.
First, we start off with the chest.
- Okay.
- And it is...
- ...18 inches.
- Eighteen.
Okay.
Now we go to her tummy...
- ...which is 18 inches.
- Eighteen inches?
Michelle, you little butterball.
And she's self-basting.
You better hope grandma's not knitting anything with horizontal stripes.
- All right, let's get her hips.
Here we go.
- Okay, hips.
And....
Eighteen.
Eighteen, 18, 18.
Exact same measurements as her father.
- Stand up.
We gotta get her inseam.
- Okay.
Okay, come on.
- Here we go.
- Stand up, Michelle.
- Do something fun.
Make this fun.
- Okay.
- Do some voices.
- What does a moo-cow say?
Moo-cow says, "moo."
And your dad lets these people take care of you?
Hey, it's hard to find good help.
Say "moo."
- Wanna come to the church bake sale?
- I can't.
I'm waiting for my cousin, Steve.
I haven't seen him in two years.
D.J., you gotta come.
This year I made The Three Wise Men out of strudel.
Kimmy, Steve's like my big brother.
We go ice skating.
We mess around.
We have so much fun.
It's like we're not even related.
- What's he look like?
- Well, looks aren't everything.
A real geek-burger, huh?
Well, he does have glasses and braces and zits but other than that, he's really cute.
Geek-burger with cheese.
Hey, Steve...means get in here.
Sorry, that was my first....
- Greetings from Baltimore.
- Steve?
D.J., how you doing, sport?
Hi, Steve.
- What happened to your glasses?
- Oh, I got contacts.
- Your braces?
- Got them off.
- Your face full of zits?
- They cleared up.
One night, I went to bed looking like a nerd and woke up like this.
Isn't nature great?
The best.
Kimmy do you realize you slammed the door in my face?
What door?
- Let me help you.
- Great.
You'll be staying in our beautiful, spacious alcove.
All right.
D.J., can you believe your little cousin Stevie is being offered a baseball scholarship from Stanford?
I am really proud.
I can't get over how you've shot up.
I give the credit to good food, plenty of exercise and all that sleep I got during class.
He's funny too.
I'm sorry.
We haven't met.
I'm....
I'm....
You're Kimmy Gibbler.
How did she make it all the way to fifth grade?
Jesse!
Joey!
Where are you?
!
- Hey, Steve-o!
- Hey, cousin Steve!
Wait, wait, let me guess.
Uncle Danny's told me all about you guys.
Now you've gotta be Jesse, the great-looking rock 'n' roller who gets all the girls and spends hours on his hair.
And you must be Joey, the guy with all the funny voices.
Steve, that's Joey and this is Jesse.
But thanks anyway.
Here's someone else you haven't met.
Say "hello" to your new cousin, Michelle.
Oh, hi.
Hi, sport.
What's the matter, don't you speak baby?
Steve, I've got our whole weekend planned out.
This afternoon, we go ice skating, okay?
I don't know.
I kind of felt like playing some basketball.
- All right!
B-ball!
- All right!
Let's shoot some hoops!
- I'm psyched!
- All right!
Let me go get my sweats on.
Oh, D.J., wait.
D.J., somebody's gotta stay here with Michelle and Stephanie.
- Would you mind?
- All right.
- Thanks.
We'll be back in an hour.
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Okay, let's pass the ball.
- Jess, I'm open.
- Danny.
- Danny, here, I'm open.
- Think fast, Steve!
- Steve, drop-pass.
I'm open.
- Here, Jess.
- All right.
- Jess, right here.
- I'm open.
- All right, Joey.
- Right here, Joey.
- Joey.
Right here....
- Joey.
- Joey.
- Got another ball?
- Let's go.
This is gonna be great.
Steve and I will eat lunch together then I'll show him these pictures of us from Thanksgiving two years ago.
How long is Steve gonna be staying at your house?
Three or four days.
Me too.
We got bologna, salami and cheese, peanut butter and grape jelly.
Sounds good.
I just hope you didn't put them all into one sandwich.
- Here, look at this one.
- Oh, neat.
- Hi, Stevie.
- Hi, guys.
We made lunch.
- Lunch!
- Food!
Food!
- Food!
Food!
- Food!
Food!
Hey, Laker-Celtic game's on.
All right!
Some more B-ball!
- B-ball, B-ball, B-ball.
- B-ball, B-ball, B-ball.
Girls, come watch the game with us.
Animals.
Glad I saved this.
Come on!
Go!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Yes!
Yes.
I think the Lakers can repeat as champions.
If they do, they'd be the first since Boston in '69 and '70.
Hey, Steve, you like my jeans?
They're brand-new.
Oh, yeah, great.
The Lakers have the best record since Portland back in '78.
They've got everything.
They got speed, power, depth and, most importantly the Laker Girls.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Yes!
What an awesome thing that just happened.
You don't have a clue either, do you?
- Does anybody else want another pickle?
- We're out of pickles.
I'll get you some.
If there are no pickles at my house I'll take a cab to the market.
- Bye, Stevie.
- See you later, Kammy.
That's Kimmy.
Hey, if it's "Kammy" to him, it's "Kammy" to me.
- I'll bet two bucks Magic steals the ball.
- Not the way Bird's playing.
You're on.
Magic steals the ball.
- No.
- Yes.
Two Founding Fathers, please.
Thank you.
Joey, that's incredible.
I come from a long line of psychics.
You mean psychos.
- Give me a chance to win my money.
- Okay.
I'm getting another vision here.
I'll bet two more bucks that Cooper steals the ball passes off to Magic, who'll lead a fast break downcourt end it with a slam-dunk by Worthy.
You're out of your gourd.
All right, you're on.
Look at this.
Cooper steals the ball, fast break.
Magic to Scott to Magic, no-look pass to Worthy.
Slam-dunk!
No way!
- Unbelievable.
- That's amazing.
Sometimes, I'm so good, I actually win money from myself.
Thank you.
Joey, you didn't know all this stuff when we watched this game this morning.
Kids, what an imagination.
One final wager.
I'll bet that if you don't give my money back you're gonna die.
And I was gonna give you half.
- Baby alert.
I gotta check on Michelle.
- Watch the game.
I'll take care of the kid.
Oh, thanks.
I'm sure you can take care of her considering you have no experience with an infant whatsoever.
No problem.
Help him.
Your nephew Steve's a great kid.
Thanks for being so nice.
Ever since his dad moved out he hasn't had much guy stuff.
Yep.
Us guys gotta stick together.
Bite.
Hey, what's the matter, Michelle?
Are you hungry?
Sleepy?
Grumpy?
Bashful?
Dopey?
Sneezy?
Doc?
Having fun?
Yeah.
I always have fun here.
Your dad is great.
- I'm real glad you're back.
- Hey, is the little kid okay?
I think she needs a changing.
No, thank you.
Be my guest.
You'll be fine.
I just think you need a dry run at this.
I think we're a little too late for that.
No, I mean practice on the monkey.
Oh, right.
- All right.
- Okay.
Put the diaper on.
Okay.
Hey, Steve, you wanna go ice skating tomorrow?
Oh, I can't.
Your dad's taking me to a Warriors game.
Okay.
Well, we can go tomorrow.
And since we'll be there at the mall, we can go to a movie and eat pizza and my friend Jennifer's having a boy-girl party.
I'll be pretty busy the whole time I'm here.
I gotta look at some colleges and, besides, I'm a little too old for that kind of stuff.
Okay, so I tape right, tape left....
All right, this monkey is ready to party.
Hi, Michelle.
How's everything going, Steve?
Well, I think this speaks for itself.
Nice work.
- Cheetah looks happy.
- Yeah.
The Bullets are playing the Pistons.
All right!
I gotta see this.
D.J., you have plans for tomorrow afternoon?
Not anymore.
Well, you do now.
We're all going to the park.
- How's some touch football sound?
- Great!
Yeah!
Then we can play some soccer, basketball, volleyball and tennis.
Then we'll play a game of "Let's Rush Uncle Danny to the Hospital."
- Great.
Come on.
- See you.
After the game, I'll take you to the locker room, introduce you to the team.
Really?
I've gotta meet Ralph Sampson.
The man is a building.
The team is a city.
Let's have a little talk here.
What do you think of your cousin Steve?
I know.
He's just a big jock.
You should've known him two years ago, back when he was my friend.
He doesn't care about me anymore.
All he cares about is sports.
Guess you're just nothing around here, unless you're one of the guys.
I really appreciate this.
Tomorrow's my first real game of touch football.
- I don't wanna look stupid.
- Stop.
You look stupid already.
- What did I do?
- D.J., you don't call it "football."
You call it "football!"
- Football!
- Yes!
That's it!
You got lesson number one.
Now, lesson number two:
The ever-popular psych-out.
No words.
Just sheer intensity.
Observe.
- It's like that.
- Something like that.
Let's show her.
Let's run a play.
Watch this.
Down and out, fake to the flag, button-hook back and I'll hit you.
- Got it.
- Here we go.
You're gonna love this.
Ready?
Hut, hut!
Go!
All right.
Go, Joey!
Watch this.
I'm reading the defense, right?
Checking the pass rush.
I'm checking my receivers.
I'm still checking my receivers.
I'm checking my watch.
Joey!
Where are you?
Sorry.
I just stopped off for a quick bite in the secondary.
Hit me!
I'm open!
- Touchdown!
- Spike it!
The football!
Yeah!
Now this is fun.
How do you guys know all this?
- Well, because we're guys.
- Yeah.
You see, it's in our blood.
Guys are just born knowing how to play....
- Football!
- Football!
All right.
Half of that money's mine, kid.
- Want another one of my sandwiches?
- No, thanks.
Three's enough.
Speaking of basketball, did you know that Wilt Chamberlain scored the most points ever in an NBA game?
And Moses Malone joined the league right out of high school.
And if the Bulls built their team around Michael Jordan, they'd be unstoppable.
Enough talk.
Let's play football!
- All right!
- Football!
All right, we'll pick teams.
I'll be a captain, because it's my football.
- All right, I'll be a captain.
- Because your hair looks like a helmet.
- Football!
- Football!
- Yes.
- Watch Michelle.
There you go.
Let's go.
Let's pick.
Okay, the first person I'm gonna pick....
- My man, Steve!
- Yeah!
All right, Uncle Danny.
Let me see.
The first person I'm gonna pick is...
- ...my man, D.J.
- Yeah!
I want you!
I want you!
Let me see.
If I'm not on Steve's team, I'll die.
Kimmy.
Way to go, big Stevie.
Okay, here we go.
Let's see, I'll pick-- I need someone with good hands.
I need someone with good hands.
I'll pick my man, Michelle.
Come on, Michelle.
High-five.
High-five
Can you believe he picked Michelle over me?
Steph, please, I have my own problems.
Okay, Steph.
You can be on our team.
- What?
- Low-five.
Somebody please pick me before a stray dog shows up.
Okay, we'll take Joey, but you guys gotta spot us a touchdown.
- That's only fair.
- Enough messing around.
- Let's play football!
- Football!
Here we go.
Remember, the end zones are that bench and this tree here.
Let's go, Joey!
Let's get this game underway.
Here we go!
Here we go!
- All right.
- All right.
Gibbler, you're dead meat.
All right.
Hut, hut, hut!
- Here we go.
Here we go.
- D.J., D.J.!
Yes!
- Touchdown!
- Yeah!
- In your face!
- In your face!
Don't worry about it, big guy.
You know, I'm worried about you.
Told you you were dead meat, Gibbler.
- Steve, aren't we having the best time?
!
- Yeah.
What are you looking at, chump?
Nothing, fool.
- Let's get them, Stevie.
- Yeah.
Don't even think about it.
- Okay, Steph.
Here we go.
- Here we go.
On three.
Hut, hut, hut!
All right.
Here, Steph.
Go!
Come on!
Got her!
We almost fell for the old Statue of Stephanie trick.
All right.
You girls had your fun.
Now it's time for us guys to play some real football.
Yeah!
Hey!
Just because we're girls doesn't mean we can't play.
Let's put the ball down and see what you guys are made of.
- Okay, Steph.
Let's go.
- Here we go.
- Here we go!
Last play.
- Here we go!
Ready, sweetie?
Okay, on two.
Hut!
Hut!
I like three better.
Sorry.
You're right.
My mistake.
Okay, on three.
Hut, hut, hut!
Yes.
Come on, Steph.
- Steve, go long!
- I'm going long.
- Yeah!
- D.J., what are you doing?
- Playing football, man.
- Well, look, this is touch football.
- What's your problem?
- I got no problem.
You got a problem?
Yeah, that was a pass interference.
Automatic first down.
No way, you wimp!
D.J., Steve's right.
You were way out of line.
We're not playing tackle.
Oh, sure, take Steve's side.
You guys are such buddies.
Why don't you just adopt him.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Great.
Now I'm gonna start crying like a little girl.
D.J.
- Halftime.
- Halftime.
Shake it off, big fella.
D.J what's with the "why don't you adopt him" stuff?
Oh, come on, Dad.
It's pretty obvious.
You're taking Steve to ball games, having fun, high-fives all over the place.
You know Steve's dad moved out last year.
Steve needs me right now.
- It's real important for him to--
- I know.
Hang out with the guys.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing, unless you're a girl.
Dad, I wanna spend time with him too.
We used to be such good friends.
I don't know what happened.
I'll tell you what's happened.
Steve's grown up a lot in the past two years.
He's becoming a young man.
D.J I know you're having a hard time with this but that's no reason to clean his clock.
Fine, Dad.
I'll go take Michelle and Stephanie, and we'll go play Duck Duck Goose.
Who is it?
It's Steve.
Can I come in?
Yeah, I guess.
You sure it's safe?
Yeah.
Thanks, I didn't wanna make the wrong move and get creamed again.
I've been here two days, and this is the first time I've ever been up to your room.
You're a busy guy.
Yeah, well, my schedule opened up, and I was hoping maybe I could talk to you.
To me?
You wanna talk to little old me?
Yeah.
Look, D.J., I was-- I was wondering why you clobbered me.
Because I felt like it.
Well, why did you feel like it?
Because I did.
Well, why did you?
Because I was mad at you.
I was looking forward to you visiting, and you didn't want to go ice skating.
I thought we could do stuff like we did last time.
I miss the old Steve.
D.J., I'm still the same Steve.
No, you're not.
The old Steve wouldn't have taken this long to come up to my room.
D.J., I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.
Look, but I'm here now.
D.J., I'm still your cousin, and I still love you.
So don't you think we can try and be friends again?
You seem so much older than me now.
Well, it may seem like a big difference now because I'm 17 and you're 11 but, you know, when I'm 100 and you're 94 you'll probably hardly even notice the difference.
So....
So....
So you wanna start all over?
Great idea.
All right.
I'll go outside, and I'll come right back in.
Okay.
Greetings from Baltimore.
Hi, Steve.
What happened to your braces, glasses and zits?
All gone.
Isn't nature great?
Hey, I got a great idea.
What do you say we go ice skating?
No, that's for little kids.
- But if you really wanna go....
- Yeah.

Frankie, Frankie, Frankie.
Aw, Frankie.
What's your mum going to say?
Have a look at that.
Frank is a very difficult child.
How difficult?
Well, three arrests by the time you're eight's not bad going.
Mind you, with his background I'm not surprised.
Father, in and out of jail, mother an alcoholic.
I hope you know what you're taking on.
- We never thought it would be easy.
- Look, fostering a child of this sort.
Yeah, we do know Mr. Jarvis.
That's why we're here.
Anymore you've got like him.
We'd be just as happy to take them.
I think you'll find that one is quite sufficient.
I think you'll find you're wrong.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
- Do you think he looks like you?
- Mmm, no.
Not handsome enough.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Frank, Carly, Lynn, Sally, Steven.
More like five is enough is sufficient Mr. Jarvis.
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow and so say all of us, and so say all of us, and so say all of us for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow and so say all of us.
Tom, give us a little speech.
Show us what you're made of.
Oh, I'll show you more than that chum if you're not careful.
Now turning forty for some men it's, it's like a threat.
End of their youth and all that sort of thing, but for me, looking around me, it's just the start.
I've got a terrific wife.
The best.
No, I'm serious mate.
I've got five top kids.
Frank, Carly, Lynn, Steven and Sally.
What about Milco?
Oh, sorry.
How could I forget him?
Milco, too.
Sorry, mate.
Yeah, we've had our ups and downs getting to know each other haven't we?
We'll probably have some more too.
I reckon I'm a pretty lucky bloke.
Now I've turned forty all I'd like to say is, well I'm just looking forward to the next forty.
I'm looking forward to seeing you all grow up, have kids of your own and you your own fortieth birthdays.
See, there's nothing to be worried about.
Not when you've got as much love around you as I have.
Let's cut that cake, hey.
G'day.
- Can I see you please, Tom?
- Yeah, whatever it is, I'm innocent.
- It's that bad, eh?
- It's not good.
Come into the office.
Hi.
You're home early.
You sick.
I just got retrenched.
What?
Yeah.
In the current economic climate, we regret, if there was any alternative, all that sort of stuff leading up to the big way and oh.
Sorry, Tom, we're closing your department.
You've been with them fifteen years.
Yeah, well old Sam's been with them twenty five.
Didn't save him.
I knew things weren't good, but I didn't think they'd pull a stunt like that.
You won't have any trouble getting another job.
No, of course I won't.
Life begins at forty, eh.
Now, I don't want any of you worrying.
It sounds a lot worse than it is.
Yeah, but you see all those things on TV about older men losing their jobs and not being able to get another one.
- Carly!
- Well you do.
Now that's all right mate.
That's what we're here for, so everyone can talk out their worries and I can answer them.
Tom won't have any trouble finding another job with his experience.
- What if he doesn't?
- Yeah.
Well, we've got some savings.
We live off those for a while.
Yeah, and I've been trying to get a job.
I'll just have to try harder now, that's all.
Yeah, we know you have mate.
Look, the last thing I want you doing is acting likes it's the end of the world.
Well, I could maybe leave school if it gets too bad.
You'll do no such thing.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
No hitting the panic button unless we have to.
Which we won't.
No one should lose any sleep over could's and maybe's.
OK.
Yeah, OK.
There's nothing in here.
Friday's always a bad day.
They'll be more tomorrow.
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, course you can, mate.
- What is it?
- I was thinking,
I've only been with you a few weeks and I'd understand if you want me to go back to the home.
No one's going anywhere.
Come here.
Do you remember we had this photo taken on your first day here?
We did the same with all the kids.
It's became a sort of ceremony.
A welcome to the family photo and once the photos taken, once you're in that frame, you're stuck there.
You're part of the family, through thick and through thin, OK.
It's just, sometimes I feel like I don't belong.
Do you trust me?
Then believe me, you do belong.
OK.
Yeah, I second that mate.
Thanks.
Nice work, Mrs F.
It has come to our attention that you have recently been retrenched and despite strenuous efforts over the last six weeks are no closer to find alternative employment.
As you are aware, any change in your circumstance has to be reviewed by us in cause it augers ill for the in your care.
We would regrettably have to reassess your situation should you prove financially unable to adequately acquit your role as foster parents.
We would appreciate it if you would call to arrange an appointment, for you and your wife at your earliest convenience.
Yours sincerely, Tarquin Pearce.
- We knew it had to come.
- Can we do anything?
I don't know.
I tell you what though.
No one's taking our kids away from us, no one.
Well, that's the bottom line.
Unless you find a job pretty quickly we'd be forced to move on the situation.
Frank's no longer our problem, of course, but, eh, we'd certainly be reviewing the custody of the others.
- Well, you're overreacting a bit, aren't you?
- Not really.
The kids will suffer more from seeing their security tumble down around them than from being taken away in the early part of the process.
They're mature enough to cope with things being a bit tight.
More than a bit if they keep going on as they are.
Yeah, we're doing everything we bloody well can.
There's no point in getting heated, eh.
- We have got a plan.
- Yes, a last resort.
Well, I'd say we were pretty well there.
Yes.
Well, we worked out some figures.
If we were to sell the house and maybe relocate out of the city we'd make quite a good profit.
We should be able to live off that for a while and we'd be able to live more cheaply as well.
It would be good for the kids.
Clean air.
Health environment.
- It's got a lot going for it.
- Move where?
- Well, we don't know.
- We'll know when we see it.
Do you mean you're prepared to sell out and up stakes just to keep the kids?
Look, I don't know what other foster parents are like, but you're acting as if this is something strange.
We'll do anything to keep the kids.
OK, OK.
I'm impressed.
Well, then, give us a go.
Hey.
Tom and Pippa should be back soon.
There's something I have to do.
Where do you go on your secret little trips anyway?
- There's nothing secret about them.
- No.
Then, why do you sneak off?
Where do you go?
- Why don't you like me?
- I don't trust you.
Tom and Pippa have got enough troubles as it is.
I can't help it if I'm a bit smarter than you.
What's that got to do with anything?
I don't know why you've got a hang up about smart kids, but you have.
That's why you pick on me.
I haven't got hang ups about anything.
You'll have your secrets, I'll have mine.
You'll keep.
And they'll want to see us all, so whatever it is you're doing will just have to wait.
And he agreed.
In fact, by the time we left he was right onside.
- He thinks it will be great for you.
- Which it will.
- So, we're moving away?
- To the country.
- Great.
- Yeah, big changes all round.
- You can count me in.
- We don't want to force anyone in to anything.
We know you all have friends here, school.
Yeah, the main thing is it'll stop Pearce making noises about breaking us up.
It's your choice.
You don't have to come with us if don't want to.
It does seem to be the only way to keep the family together.
- Milco wants to go.
- I thought he might.
What about you?
Me too.
Me and Milco always think the same.
Funny that.
Look as Pippa said no ones being forced to do anything, be great.
A whole new start.
- Steven.
- Yeah.
Do you want to talk about it?
You didn't look too happy.
Tonight.
I'm late for something.
What is it?
Well it's Brad.
If we move I'm never going to see him again.
Brad Adams.
I thought you couldn't stand him.
Yeah, I couldn't, but that's just because I thought he was so gorgeous and he acted like I didn't exist.
- That's changed, has it?
- Yes.
Yesterday I dropped my books and he picked them up for me.
He smiled at me.
- That's it.
- Well, at least he knows that I'm alive.
- It's start, eh.
- Yeah, I know and if we move.
Look, you can believe, but in six months
I'll say the name Brad and you'll say Brad who.
Didn't think so.
It's not like I've been with them long.
You know I'd give you a home if I could.
That was good friend.
- Pippa and Tom are great.
It's--
- The other kids.
Yeah.
The oldest one, Frank.
What's his beef?
It's because I'm smart.
He said it's because he doesn't trust me.
That's not it.
Why should your being smart worry him?
At least with the karate he'll think twice about hitting you.
They don't even know I'm doing it.
I don't want them to know, because if they do, they'll start asking questions and
I'll have to tell them that dad taught me.
I can't help thinking of him and mum burning and--
I couldn't keep on having lessons wherever we went and I think dad would have wanted me to.
Small towns have karate schools.
Not many.
You're good enough now to keep it up on your own anyway.
You've found a good mob to live with.
Frank will cool down.
You don't want to go back to the home now, do you?
Well there.
- G'day, Alf.
- G'day, Alf.
G'day, Nev, Floss.
How are you going?
Aw, can't complain as the bearded lady said to the barber.
Aw, Neville.
There not getting any better.
Hear you thinking of buying a new boat.
- Who's the big mouth, Floss?
- Ailsa.
That would be right.
You get your groceries from Ailsa and you get the news of the world as well.
Decided to come and play landlord did you?
Yeah, well I might not have to much longer.
I've got a family coming to look over the place.
A young couple, a couple of mugs I hope.
- There coming to look the place over.
- Yeah.
When?
Well, I thought they might have been here now as a matter of fact.
- They're coming here now.
- For an inspection.
Yeah, what's wrong?
Well, nothing, nothing, no.
You should have called, that's all.
We'd have given the place a bit of a tidy up wouldn't we, Nev?
- Yeah, sure.
- It's not too late.
Why don't you go and clear some of the junk out of the way?
- All right.
- Aw, look.
Don't worry about it.
I mean, the joints not looking real flash anyway.
Go on, love.
Yeah.
We wouldn't want you to think that we've lost you the sale, Alf.
Place being on the market for so long.
Still got a problem with them geraniums.
Here, people are coming to look the place over.
We'll keep Alf busy and you better get in to the bushes until there gone.
It's too late.
I'll make sure they'll look at the house first.
When they are inside you skedaddle.
Right, this is our lot.
This is Frank, Carly, Lynn, Steven and Sally.
And Milco.
- Milco.
- Milco.
Milco.
Sorry, Milco.
Yeah, Milco is Sally's special friend.
He's a bit hard to see sometimes.
Oh, he's not hard to see at all.
How do you do, Milco?
He's just like the little folks at the Carnie.
Now you could always see them if you took the trouble to look properly, but you wouldn't believe the number of people who couldn't be bothered and used to knock the poor little blighters over.
- Floss and I worked in shows for years.
- Oh, yeah.
Madame Zara, fortune teller.
And I was the billed as the world's strongest man.
That was just for kids and it was a long time ago.
Well, eh--
Don't wander too far.
We'll tell you when we're going inside the house.
You should do that first up.
It's lovely in there.
Aw, too right it is.
Yeah, it's a credit to Floss the way she keeps it.
We can if you like.
No, you're right.
I think I'll look at the books first.
I'll get that boring financial stuff out of the way.
Now, tell me, how does the place move?
Well, in it's heyday it was a goldmine.
- Aw, I could kill you, Nev.
- Uh.
Such I nice young couple and their family.
I'd like to be able to relax and enjoy their visit.
- Well, there's no chance of that.
- Exactly.
We better keep an eye on those kids.
We don't want them going in the caravans.
- Alf tells me you've retired here, Neville.
- Yeah.
See it as a bit of a home for a while do you?
Yeah, that's right, Tom.
Hey.
What is it, child?
What's wrong?
- She hit me.
- Who?
- The girl in there.
- There was no girl.
She went round here.
She's more shocked than hurt I think.
Where does it hurt, Sally?
My bum.
Bottom.
- My bottom.
- Oh, does it hurt bad?
- Anything else that hurts.
- It's numb.
Oh, I think you're going to have a bruised bum pumpkin.
- Bottom.
- Sorry.
There wasn't anyone there.
There was someone.
There was a girl.
Have you seen a girl around the place?
No, not me.
Floss?
No.
She probably toppled back when she opened the door.
It tends to be a bit free on its hinges that one.
Well, if there was someone there she's gone now.
Come on, we're going to get you cleaned up.
Hey, you can use the house if you want, Tom.
Thanks, Alf.
I told you that girl would be trouble.
- There's no real harm in her.
- Well, what do you call that?
You'll have us in strife with the cops if you're not careful.
Good as new.
Should we get on with the tour and inspection, shall we?
Sure, sure.
In case you hadn't of noticed, this is the kitchen and of course the dining room.
Carly.
No, you're all right, kids.
Poke your noses in wherever you like.
You're here to have a look.
Just take it easy please.
We don't want Alf here suing us for property damage.
Let's hope you buy the place and then it won't matter what you do.
- It's so clean.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, like I said I've had Floss look after it since my wife died.
She used to keep the place spotless.
Only woman I knew who'd wipe under the table every day.
She would have wanted it this way and she would have wanted a nice family like you lot in the place.
Let's have a look upstairs, shall we.
How far is it to the beach, Mr. Stewart?
Oh, my dear from here I'd say it's about a well hit two wood.
Sorry, you're not a golfer.
Just down the road.
Carly wants to know where to find the surfies.
- Lynn.
- Oh, don't be embarrassed Carly.
There's some very nice surfies down there.
- Aw, great, stairs.
- Last one up's a rotten egg.
I've got a good feeling about this place.
Yeah, I think he's a bit of a shafter.
Well, we'll just have to out shaft him, won't we?
- Aw, bags this room.
- You're--
Wow!
Good girl.
Aw, I'll fix that.
Why don't you have a look in that room and see if you see the pussy cat that lives in there.
Wow!
Well, I'd say if the kids have got anything to do with it, I've got myself a sale.
Why don't we look in the main bedroom?
I've got a bit of a surprise for you.
All right.
Yeah, we should have given them sedatives.
Every squeal of joy adds a hundred to the price.
- Well, what do you reckon?
- It's beautiful.
It's antique, isn't it?
Yeah, it's been in my wife's family for years and my daughters not one for sentiment so no one to leave it to.
I always said if I found the right young couple that it would go with the house.
I reckon I've found them.
They seem such a nice young couple.
- Who?
- The Fletchers of course and all this waffle Alf's going on with.
This place has never done well.
I don't know where he's got them figures he's been showing them.
- It's called creative accounting love.
- I don't care what it's called.
I don't like seeing nice young folk diddled.
I'm in half a mind to say something.
Here.
You keep your beak out of it.
It's none of our business.
Oh, that's right.
You'll help a little crim, but you won't say a word to help a decent young couple.
Number one, Bobby didn't do what they say she did.
You've only got her word for that.
It's good enough for me and number two, the Fletchers look smart enough to look after themselves so keep your beak out of it Floss.
Rack off!
The caravan park, you're hoping to make a go of it, are you?
Well, you bet.
From the business it used to do, a bit of spit and polish, we'll have it going soon.
And we're not only buying a house, we're buying a job into the bargain.
- Ah, I was thinking--
- Floss.
I was just about to suggest that I give Pippa a reading.
I'm getting vibrations dear.
I reckon a good in the crystal ball could yield results.
Aw, I don't.
- Aw, go on, Pippa.
- Come on.
Bookie, bookie, bookie.
I'm with you mate.
Don't mock what you don't understand, you fellow, me lad.
Aw come on love.
Give an old girl a go.
Go on.
- Why not?
- Come in then.
- Now, Floss.
- Girls only, Nev.
Get rid of them.
- Ah, Donald.
- Mr. Fisher.
I heard a commotion so I thought I should check.
Better to be safe than sorry.
I was burgled recently myself so I'm very aware of it.
- Donald Fisher.
- Ah, please to meet you.
I live over there.
It's a distance, but not that far.
Noise carries unfortunately.
I'll play my bagpipes whenever the mood takes me.
I wouldn't object if you could play.
If I a man can't use his retirement to learn an instrument he's admired all his life, what can he do?
- And your name?
- Ah, Tom Fletcher.
Yeah, Tom's thinking of buying the place.
Yeah, and these are my kids.
Steven, Lynn, Sally, Frank and Carly.
Charming.
Charming.
I see an oven.
Let me look inside.
Aw, Books.
Books.
Books in an oven.
That's what I see.
Why would anyone want to cook books for?
Alf's books are shonky right?
Madame Zara doesn't interpret;
she just tells what she sees.
Thanks for the warning, Floss, but we're not totally gullible.
Anyway, who cares what the figures were?
It's what they are going to be that's important.
You're quite a shrewdie aren't you Miss Earagard.
No flies on you.
We'll be back.
Milco.
Where's Milco?
We left Milco behind.
He's definitely back there.
I've told you about this before, young lady.
Milco's your responsibility.
You're supposed to see he's in the car, all right.
Back we go.
Told you.
- I didn't hurt her, did I?
- You could have.
You think I'm a creep or something.
Go around, getting a kick out of hurting little kids.
You don't think, Bobby.
That's just your problem.
Yeah.
Well thanks for nothing.
You don't have to help me now.
Stop it both of you.
Look, we're letting you hide out her because we believe what you told us and we're no fonder of Fisher than you are.
I suppose you think I really did pip his joint off.
If I thought that you'd be out of here so fast your feet wouldn't hit the ground.
Now, Neville sees some good in you, all right, so be it, but that doesn't mean I have to lie, you here.
It's a criminal offence, you know.
Harbouring a felon.
Geez, you're a dag, Floss.
Hey, you watch your tongue.
Now off you go.
You're OK, Nev.
That's the girl that hurt me.
Get her.
All right, who are you?
Who the hell are you?
Justice prevails for once.
Congratulations, Mr. Fletcher, a perfectly executed citizens arrest.
Come on.
Let go of me.
Come on.
Let go of me.
- I'll follow in my car.
- No need to worry, Mr. Fisher.
It was my house the girl burgled.
I ought to be there.
What do those two know about it?
Nothing, if you insist.
Good to have you in the neighbourhood, Fletcher.
Now, how come I get the feeling we wish we hadn't caught her?
Yeah, because what ever she is, she's a creep.
- Yeah.
- Do you think she did it?
Well he's certainly got her hung, drawn and quartered before she's even charged.
I got the story from Neville.
She's a local.
Mother's dead, dad's in jail.
Apparently Fisher's always had it in for her.
- And this her first arrest?
- She's always in trouble.
She said she never broke into Fisher's house.
Neville thinks someone else did it.
Fisher saw it as a chance to get rid of her.
- So you reckon Fisher lied?
- Well, either he did or she did.
He swears he caught in the act.
She says she was never even there.
Anyway, whatever she is, Neville says she's no liar.
He says there is a lot of good underneath.
- No.
- What do you mean?
I know you.
We're going to have enough on our plate moving into this place.
There's no harm in just trying to get to know the girl, even if she is found guilty.
It's her first offence, she might get off on a bond.
Look, we're not taking on anyone else's future until we've got our own sorted out.
- But--
- No, no.
Just practising my routine for the Riley night.
- Oh, she's coming in.
- Who?
The lass who's just taken over Alf's old place.
Fletcher's the name.
Husband, wife, five children.
Poor little thing.
She must be worn out.
Catholic I expect.
I saw the children.
I took a peak up the drive just as I was passing.
- Yeah, neighbourly curiosity.
- Yes, yes, just neighbourly curiosity.
I was wondering if it was her second marriage.
None of the children looked anything alike.
In fact, one of them looked positively foreign.
- Aw.
- Oh, well,
I'll just browse around Ailsa whilst you attend to, Mrs Fletcher.
Mrs Doris Peters.
How do you do?
Nice to see you.
Welcome to Summer Bay.
There's not many secrets around here.
Ailsa Hogan.
I'm Pippa Fletcher.
Please call me Pippa.
Of course, as long as you can manage Ailsa.
- How are you settling in?
- Fine.
It's only a few weeks since you looked the place over.
You must have got all that paperwork settled very quick.
Like I said, there's not that much that goes on around here that everybody doesn't get to hear about.
Alf was kind enough to let us move in before everything was finalised.
It's school holidays so it was a good time to move without disrupting the kids.
- Five I hear.
- I'm sure you'll be seeing plenty of him.
- You're a beggar for punishment.
- No, it's not like that.
Tom and I can't have any of our own so we fostered.
Oh.
This has gone up.
I hope Pippa hurries up.
I'm starving.
- Me too.
- What are you doing there, pumpkin?
I can't find Milco.
Maybe he's hiding in one of these.
Aw, I'm pretty sure he hasn't.
Why don't you just check upstairs?
Tom, do you think it's wise to keep pandering to her childish fantasies?
- Pandering to her childhood fantasies.
- I only asked.
Yeah, well we got along without your concerns until now, thanks.
Cut it out you two.
Now, you see, Steve, having Milco around helped Sal through some rough times before she came to us.
Yeah, she lost her parents and her nan.
Yeah, she didn't have anyone, but Milco.
We figure one day she won't need him anymore and he, well, he'll just be gone.
You should have told me.
Everyone's background is there own business in this family, mate.
People tell, they tell what they want to tell, but that's an important bit, so you can understand, all right.
Einstein, understands all about not telling people things.
Get off my back and stop calling me Einstein.
Hey, hey, break it up.
Don't grind him so much, eh.
- I don't trust him.
- I do.
Well you would, wouldn't I?
- Well, I do.
- You never, ever give up.
That's enough.
Now split, all of you, all in different directions, all right, and when you come back, I want to see some smiles.
So, all in all I feel pretty damn lucky.
- We're the happiest family.
- Sounds perfect.
I believe you had a bit of trouble with one of our local youngies when you were first here.
- Bobby.
- Yeah, that's her.
Mmm.
- No need for that, Doris Peters.
- The girl's a mischief.
It's just a shame the courts can't see it.
You agree with Neville and Floss, do you?
Aw, there's good there, all right.
I heard she got off on a bond.
A few of us around town willing to bat for her.
You obviously care for her.
- I have a thing about underdogs.
- She's very aggressive.
Aw, not always and when she smiles, she's a different girl.
- I've never seen her smile.
- No, I'm sure you haven't, Doris.
This town's divided into pro and anti Bobby.
The anti's are led by Fisher.
You might have another member on your team.
What are you doing, creep boy?
Over here bozo.
I asked you a question?
- None of your business.
- Tough.
- What's your problem?
- You and your family, vacuum head.
- You're a Fletcher, right?
- So?
So, you watch it.
- Your own little room, eh.
- It's my favourite.
Sleep tight.
Hey, butterfly kiss.
That's a good girl.
Sleep tight, pumpkin.
- Can I have it on?
- A big girl like you.
- You're not afraid of the dark.
- Milco is.
Aw, I see.
Probably because it's a strange new place, right?
Aw, I think we can leave the light on tonight, just for Milco, can't we, Pippa?
I think we might.
Nightie night.
Yeah, night you lot.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Aw.
- Oh, Brad.
Shut your face, pea brain.
No dirty dreams about him.
I should be so lucky.
Make it work, God.
Don't let us all be split up.
- Amen.
- Saying your prayers, are we?
Nothing wrong with that.
Waste of time.
While you're at it ask him to send me a new boyfriend as good as Brad.
Good night.
Oh, Brad.
Turn it off, Egghead.
Well, you told me not to call you Einstein.
I can't sleep with you flashing this thing about.
- Give it back.
- Or what?
- You're not worth it.
- Wimp.
Someone with brains must have really dumped on you once.
Is that what you call psychology, is it?
No, I call it sense.
Night, Dad.
Night, Mum.
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.
Everything's going to be all right.
It already feels like home.
Yeah, well let's make it even more like home.
I love you.
Yes, I feel strangely attracted to you too.
Hey, I forgot something.
Hey, nothing can be that important.
It is to me.
Now, where were we?
Hey, Lance, check it out.
- Yeah, right, check it out.
- Whoa.
I hope that's not the best Summer Bay can offer.
- He's going to talk to us.
- Not for long he's not.
How are you going?
He's Martin.
I'm Lance.
And I'm not interested.
- Too bad, mate.
- Shut up.
It's your loss.
Suckers.
If that's the answer to last nights prayer then I'm an atheist.
- What's an atheist?
- She's just being silly.
G'day.
Amen.
Thanks, Ailsa.
I'll catch you.
All the junk you eat, it's a wonder you're not one big pimple.
You should have seen the look on your face.
Hey, it's the Fletcher girls.
Boo.
Come on in, girls.
Don't mind Bobby.
She's all bark and no bite.
Now what can I get you?
Oh, I think I know what you like.
- She's nice.
- Yeah, Pippa said she was.
- Won over.
- Yeah.
- How are we little girls?
- Just ignore her.
Don't think you're going to get away with it that easy, do you?
- You lot got me arrested.
- Look, you got yourself.
- Think you're tough do you?
- Leave her alone.
- Or what?
- Look, you want a fight,
I'll give you a fight, but not around her.
Come inside, Bobby.
Carly, take her home.
- You'll pay.
- Get inside.
You always have to do it, don't you?
- They're creeps.
- They're nice young kids.
- They're as bad as Fisher.
- Their mother was in here yesterday.
She was actually worried about you.
She won't give a damn now.
- Doesn't worry me.
- Now you listen to me, young lady.
You need every friend you can get.
OK, you've had a tough life, but it only excuses so much.
If you're not careful, you'll even turn the likes of me against you, now out.
In case you're wondering, it's a pineapple upside down cake.
What happened?
Ailsa told me I might find you here.
I'm Pippa Fletcher.
Come to warn me off, have you?
Our family is not out to get you.
- I don't care.
- We regret what happened.
- Sure you do.
- Please.
Hear me out.
I want to prove to you that the arrest wasn't our idea.
We've got spare caravans.
You can have one rent free if you help out around the grounds.
- Me.
Live at your joint.
- Why not?
You already have.
That was before the Brady Bunch moved in.
You don't have to have anything to do with us if you don't want to.
I'm offering you accommodation, that's all.
- Why?
- I came here wanting to thump you, then I thought that makes me no better than you.
- And that's pretty rotten, isn't it?
- I didn't mean that.
Ailsa told me where you live so I went there looking for you.
- It's a hovel.
- I does me.
I want to prove to you that we're friends and help you into the bargain.
- What do you say?
- I get it.
Talk about running scared.
You think by buttering me up will stop me hitting your little brats, then forget it.
- It's a genuine offer.
- Sure it is.
- I don't want trouble with you, Bobby.
- You've got it.
I'm warning you.
I'm not going to stand by and watch you hurt my children and I don't think you want to.
Don't bet on it.
Now I'm in full charge and you're all going to do what I say.
Ooohh.
Now there's some raking to be finished round there.
Lynn and Sally.
Milco and I declare that the barbecue is open.
Look at what we've done in just a few days.
It's working, Tom.
Tom, Tom, fire!
One of the caravans is on fire.
Come down here quick.
Fire!
Floss, be careful.
Tom, the fire brigade is on it's way.
Can't you do anything?
No, it's too far gone.
The bush is dry.
If we don't contain it the whole damn thing might go up.
Watch out!
I don't believe it.
When did you put that bloody thing there?
Well, where's the fire?
Aw, deary me.
I'm too far over the hill for this sort of caper.
You're not the only love and I'm afraid you won't need your crystal ball to see what's going to happen.
What do you mean?
Well, no one's had time to think yet, but when they do I'm going to give you one guess at where they're going to point the finger.
Right.
I just want to know one thing.
- Did you do it?
- Rack off!
Did you do it?
See.
Even you think I might have.
Don't blame me for going while the going's good.
- Did you do it?
- No, all right.
- Bloody well no, OK.
- If you do a flit now you're as a good as signing a confession to something you didn't do.
I'm on a bond, a good behaviour bond.
Torching a caravan's not good behaviour.
- There was no proof that you did it.
- There was no proof I robbed Fisher.
Aw, how many times do I have to tell you?
The Fletcher's are nothing like Donald Fisher.
If you start running now, you won't stop Bobby, trust me.
Trust me, you stubborn little idiot.
I'm sick of being dumped on, Ailse.
Sit down.
I noticed the police sifting through the ashes as I came over.
Glad to see you brought them in.
Yeah, well we didn't really have much choice.
- Alf had to report the fire.
- Well at least we will see justice done.
- Just, why are you here, Mr. Fisher?
- Well, it's obvious, isn't it.
There's no doubt that they'll find proof of arson.
I've suffered at the girls hands too.
I understand.
Yeah, there are such things as electrical faults.
And there are such things as delinquent girls.
You know it wasn't a girl as well as I do.
Bobby Simpson decided to get her own back.
There's no proof.
There will be and I want to make sure you don't side with the bleeding hearts of Summer Bay when there is.
With your help I can see the girl behind bars, where she belongs, even if we have to tell a few white lies.
I know I can count on a decent couple like yourselves.
- Out please!
- There's no need.
- Our or I'll throw you out.
- I expected better from you.
Just because I helped you arrest Bobby by accident, don't think we're going to join your little club.
We don't get kicks out of persecuting kids.
- Or framing them.
- What does that mean?
- I think you know.
- Well, if that's your attitude.
- You better believe.
- Hardly surprising of course.
I hear you little brood all come from bad blood too.
I'll go now while the going's good if I were you.
I was prepared to be a good neighbour.
I can see how it's going to be though.
I have a lot of influence in this area.
- The condemned man ate a hearty meal.
- What?
- With or without salt?
- It's my nerves.
You haven't done anything wrong.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Come on.
Come give us a hand.
Why do you bother, Ailse?
Because if I don't they'll be nothing on the shelves, stupid.
No, I don't mean this.
I mean me.
Why bother?
- I'm a beggar for punishment.
- No, I'm serious.
Why?
I knew somebody very like you once.
They weren't given a chance.
What happened to them?
Nothing.
Oh, this old dames got a history darling, but don't expect to hear it from my lips.
Do you want a cuppa?
- I want to hear the story.
- One cuppa coming up.
Stop.
Ailsa.
G'day, Bobby.
Thought I might find you here.
I'd like a word with you.
Look, you don't know what she's like.
You haven't been there.
- You are overreacting.
- We're not.
You're not being fair.
Will you listen to me please, for a minute.
Now the police have found no proof one or another.
They know it wasn't an electrical fault, but there's no proof of arson either.
- They're not sure how it started.
- So it could have been Bobby.
- It could have been.
- Yeah, but we're not prepared to see someone thrown in the slammer on a maybe.
She's on a good behaviour bond.
If she breaks it, she's done for.
- Yeah, well good riddance.
- Yeah.
- I hate her.
- Sally.
Well, I do!
Look, I can understand you girls, but we can't tell the police to put her away just because she had a go at you.
If we do, we'd be no better than Fisher.
And I don't think any of us want to be like him.
- No, no way!
- We've told the police that we're not interested in seeing it taken further and that means by any of us.
So that means if you see Bobby, they'll be no accusation and no slanging matches because we decide right here and now that she didn't do it, right, and we never mention it again.
Right.
Yeah, OK.
- Carly.
- Look, if she hassles me I'm not just.
Yeah, well you just come and see us, but no accusations right.
Good to see her happy for a change.
I hope she realises how lucky she is.
If the Fletcher's had really wanted to force the issue it might have been a different story.
Yeah, I hope she realises that to.
I don't suppose a pies out of the question.
Come on.
They're hot.
Hey, Lance, check it out.
It's Bobby, man.
Yeah, right.
G'day, you dag.
Up yours, Lance.
That's no way to talk to Summer Bay's most eligible bachelors.
Aw, I don't know where they are.
I can only see you blokes.
We used to be good enough for you once.
Yeah, well we all grow up, don't we?
Well some of us do.
Aw, guess what.
Barnett just told me I'm off the hook, not even if I torched that caravan.
- Do you reckon we should tell her mate?
- Good for a laugh.
Hey, Bobby, what would it be worth to you to know who lit the fire?
You know?
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
- But you don't get nothing for nothing.
- Right!
- Who brought the echo?
- What do you mean?
- Forget it.
Who was it?
- What's it worth?
Tell me Martin or I'll throw up.
Just tell us.
A mate of Lance, he snuck in with his Sheila for a bit of fun and he reckons he left a ciggy burning.
Not surprised though.
He's a real drongo.
- Yeah.
- When did you find this out?
- This morning.
- He told me at work.
You knew this morning and you didn't say anything.
- Aw, I'm not going to dob in a mate.
- What about me?
Aw, you're not a mate.
You're just a--
- A Sheila.
- Sheila, yeah, that's right.
You mongrels.
- Watch it
- Hey!
I nearly had my whole life stuffed up and you knew all along.
- Bobby.
- Take it easy.
- I'm going to kill you!
- You're nuts!
- Aw, you're nuts!
- Let go of me!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Rack off!
I don't need any help.
Doesn't look like it to me.
Drop her!
- We'll do what we like.
- You with weed killer.
- Yeah, you weed.
- Rack off will you.
Not until they go.
- Aw, I'm scared.
- This is your last chance.
What are you going to do about it?
Blow on us.
Come on.
That's it, mate.
Where did you learn to do that?
- You're going now, aren't you?
- You should watch your temper, kid.
- Can't a bloke have a joke.
- Serves you right.
She's nuts.
You can have her.
Did you see that?
The little blokes Bruce Lee.
- You sure you're a Fletcher?
- Yeah.
- Well, why did you help me then?
- Well, why not?
- You don't even like me.
- Who said?
- Don't tell my family about.
- The karate?
- Yeah.
- As if I'd talk to your family.
- Hey.
- Yeah.
The cops reckon your folks kept them off my back.
Did they?
Yes.
Pippa and Tom are OK.
Did you know we're not their kids?
We're fostered, all of us.
So here's to Neville and Floss.
Neville and Floss, we can't thank you enough for all that help.
Aw, no worries.
Getting stuck into a bit of work like that helps the old girl drop a bit of weight.
The only weight I'll drop will be this fist on your head if you don't watch it.
Ooh.
No, seriously, though, you two, thanks for last night and your help with the clean up.
It was great.
Oh, my pleasure, as the Siamese twins said to their girlfriend.
A bloke with a crook back is not really up to all this disco dancing rubbish.
Where's your crook back when it comes to bowling?
Golf.
Bowls is an old mans game.
Besides, that's different.
I think your back is very selective about when it does and doesn't play up.
Oh, hello, Pippa.
I won't keep you a minute.
- No hurry.
Hi, Alf.
- G'day, Pip.
Look, Ailse, I've got nothing against dancing, but just so long as I don't have to do it.
In other words you'd rather go to the pub, again.
- You're a born salesman.
- Oh, come on, Alf.
Haven't you ever heard the word variety?
Yeah, it's the spice of life, but just because we're going to the pub doesn't mean there's going to be any spice.
Oh, stop it, Alf Stewart!
Go on.
Get out of here!
I'll pick you up about eight.
You fixed your barbie yet?
We're thinking of leaving it as it is.
The leaning tower of Summer Bay.
Might catch on as a tourist attraction.
Love a woman with a sense of humour.
Rare commodity.
I didn't know you and Alf were an item.
Oh, we're what they used to call in the old days a courting couple.
The trouble is it's more coupling than courting.
What can I get you?
Five hundred grams of sliced ham to start with.
- Bobby's still playing it cool.
- Oh, is she still out there?
- I think she might like a word with you.
- Why?
Well, let's just say she's starting to see things a bit differently.
- Hey!
- Yeah.
You know that caravan, is it still there?
- The one I said you could live in.
- Right!
Like, it's not the one that burnt down or anything, is it?
- No.
- Is the offer still good?
Do you want to take me up on it?
Could do for a while, I suppose.
Good.
- You did what?
- You heard.
Well, when did you come up with this little bright idea?
Remember the other day when I tracked her down and read her the riot act.
Oh, asking her to live with us is reading the riot act.
She won't be living with us.
She'll just be using one of the caravans.
Look, this is the girl that's been monstering our kids.
- It's all going to change.
- Oh, you've got that in writing, have you?
I thought you were on her side.
I didn't want her thrown in the slammer.
That doesn't mean I want her living here.
You've never even met her.
Believe me, it's a breakthrough.
Look, you know what we're doing here, don't you?
I mean, we need every bit of support we can from this town, to make this place a going concern.
You bring her in, you risk blowing it.
I mean, if we don't get this place up and running love, we jeopardise the entire family.
The departments out there waiting to take our kids off us or have you forgotten that fact?
I'm sorry, love, but that's the way things are.
There's no guarantee bringing Bobby here will cause trouble.
If it does I'll ask her to leave.
We've never turned our back on a kid in trouble before.
Did she actually ask you if she could move in?
Yes.
- Well, do you think it might work?
- It's worth a try.
Right, one condition.
We have to get a majority vote on it.
We rave on about being democratic parents.
We're going to have to put our money where our mouths are.
Well, that's about it.
Over to you.
- You must be nuts.
- Sounds OK to me.
Aw, what would you know?
You've never even met the girl.
- Have so.
- Aw, where?
- Down the beach one day.
- What happened?
Nothing.
I said hi and she said hi.
That was it.
- I bet.
- Einstein's got the knack.
- Hey.
- Sorry.
Steven has.
The trouble with you girls was once incident.
I'm sure she's over it.
- I hate her!
- Would you stop saying that.
- But I do!
- Hey, let's take a vote, shall we, before we all start arguing.
Majority rules, OK.
Now, hands up all those in favour of giving Bobby a go, and I want to stress, the first sign of trouble and she'll be out.
Yeah, well, I suppose we should at least give her a go.
That's four.
Sorry, girls.
That's a majority.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is, sweetheart.
Me, Tom, Steve, Frank, that's four.
You, Lynn and Carly that's three.
- Four to three, that's a majority.
- What about Milco?
- What about him?
- Me, Carly, Lynn and Milco.
That makes four.
Four of us and four of you.
- Sorry, sweetie, but Milko can't vote.
- Why not?
Yeah, why not?
Milco's a member of the family, isn't he?
- Carly.
- Well, he is!
You can't say he is one minute and not the next.
- Yeah.
- You're a stirrer, Carly.
- So what if I am.
- We don't want her here.
Right, and you said there had to be a majority vote for it to happen.
Well, there's not a majority vote.
It's a tie so Bobby.
You watch your tongue, young lady.
Milco can't vote and that's it.
- Milco can vote, he can.
- Aw, Sal.
- It's not fair!
- We agree, Sal.
Come on.
Let's go!
You can't change the rules to suit yourself.
We'll by upstairs.
Come on, Milco!
- I could throttle her!
- Yeah, she's being a little devil.
- She's got a point.
- What point?
Well we can't acknowledge Milco just when it suits us.
If we do that we're threatening Sal's whole belief in him.
It's effectively giving her two votes.
If we want to be consistent, yes it is.
Look, I'm on your side about Bobby, but Tom's right.
So Bobby loses out because of a figment of Sally's imagination.
- Not unless you can talk Milco around.
- Don't be stupid, Tom.
Maybe I can!
Now no giving in OK.
Yes.
- I'm sorry I was cross, girls.
- That's OK.
We're not going to change our minds.
I wanted to say sorry to Milco too.
Where is he, Sal?
Of course!
Maybe I got cross about you voting Milco because this means such a lot to me.
Remember how we helped you and Sally when you came to us.
I want to help Bobby too.
I know she can be mean.
She's never had anyone to love her.
Her mummies dead and her daddies gone away.
No one cares about her.
Maybe you'd be like her if you hadn't come to live with us.
I'm so proud of you and the girls.
Wouldn't it be terrific if we could help Bobby.
Give her the chance you've all had.
That's all.
- That will be her.
- I'll get it.
- Do your best.
- Bobby, right!
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good to have you around the place.
- I'm Tom.
Come on in.
- The neighbours.
Well, you know most of the family, but by name, Steven.
Yeah, I know Steve.
- Sally.
- Hi!
- Frank.
- Hi!
Lynn and Carly.
Yeah, well, that's that done.
We're having some lunch.
Do you want to join us?
- Not hungry.
- Sure.
- Yeah, just point me to the caravan.
- I'll be back in a minute.
There you go.
All right.
It will do.
I'll leave you to it then.
You know where we are if you need anything?
What's my first job?
- Sorry.
- Around the joint.
- Nothing for nothing.
- No rush about that.
The deal was this for some work.
I'm no one's charity case.
Fair enough.
Ask Tom about it.
Ah, place where you used to live.
Full of love, eh.
Yeah, I'm getting green and white.
Yeah, white, it was white with a green face, eh.
- Right!
- Yeah, just you and your parents.
Oh, no, no there another bloke.
Of course there is.
- A friend of your dads, eh.
- Yeah, Bill.
You're amazing!
Got to go, Floss.
What about the rest of your reading?
Maybe later, eh.
- You would bring those things out.
- I have to practice sometime.
Well you scared young Steven off and I was giving him a real good read too.
- More likely you scared him off yourself.
- Peesh, tash.
You're good when you get going, Floss.
Sometimes you see things that people don't want you to see.
Oh, young Steven just didn't want his ears bashed, that's all.
- Oh, not around here.
- What's wrong with it?
It's hardly a turn on.
Turn on.
Picking up the kids lingo, are we?
- Turn on.
- Oh, stop leering, Nev.
- You're too old to leer.
- You can't blame a bloke.
You're still a very fetching woman, Floss.
Oh, get away will you.
What are you going to do now?
Well, I'm going to do a reading for Bobby and see what it says.
Ah, good idea!
Did you see the way he looked at me?
- You don't even know his name?
- Well, he'll get round to telling me.
- That's if he even talks to you.
- Great, that's all we need.
She's not too bad.
She wouldn't even be here if you and Sal had listened to me.
Well, after what Pippa said.
Emotional blackmail.
Don't, it's not worth it.
You should be used to it by now.
- Oh, it's not that, it's these.
- Oh, what does it say?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
It's not like that crystal ball stuff she goes on with.
- She's really accurate with the cards.
- She's an old fake.
She'd have pumped the other kids for information.
She knew things none of them know.
I've never come across a paranormal phenomenon before.
To any of us she's a fortune teller, to him she's a paranormal phenomenon.
Yeah, well you wouldn't need to be paranormal to read this lot.
Not good, eh.
Isn't there a tarot card called the hangmen.
Oh, I'm going to puncture that bloody thing one day.
I suppose we have been going through money like water.
The dams almost dry.
We had to start getting things ship shape.
We'll just have to economise from now on.
It will be OK when the customers start coming in, whenever that is.
They will.
Word just has to get around.
Yeah.
Even when it does there's no guarantee they'll come.
And then we've got the offices to cope with.
I think it's time I did something about getting a job.
- Need a hand, Ailsa.
- Oh, no thanks.
- Think it's just the plugs.
- Fine.
Mervin.
I hear that Tom Fletcher was in for a interview today.
That's right.
I think there's something we should speak about.
Oh, what's that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, I understand, Mr. Baldivis.
Yeah, sure.
Well, look, if anything else should come up.
Thank you.
He wants a younger man would you believe.
Ah, there's plenty more jobs going.
Course they are.
- Aw, g'day.
- Hello.
Aw, I've been meaning to ask you, any of your lot got any talent.
We're looking for another act for the variety night.
Frank plays guitar, or if you're really desperate you could get Neville to play a solo on the bagpipes.
We want an audience, thanks.
Hey, are you all right.
- I'm trying to stay positive.
- What's wrong?
You don't want to hear.
Bobby's not playing up again, is she?
No, apart from some tension with Carly she's doing better than we could have hoped.
It's just that Tom can't find a job.
He goes for interviews, everything seems OK and then we get the thanks, but no thanks call.
He's been out looking every day this week.
Gets you down after a while.
Yes.
He should be able to get something.
Well, that's what we thought, but jobs just don't grow on trees.
Certainly not in a small town like this.
Look, I might be wrong, but I think I know what's been happening?
What do you mean?
I think your next door neighbour is one step ahead of you all the time.
Mr. Fletcher, a rather boisterous knock.
I know what you're up to, Fisher.
- I don't understand.
- Oh, you understand all right.
Perhaps you'll be good enough to enlighten me then.
We both know you've been white handing me getting jobs.
Me, stopping you getting work.
That's ridiculous.
- I know it for a fact.
- Well, I suggest you check your facts.
- I've got witnesses!
- Then they're mistaken.
What you do or don't do is of no interest to me, Mr. Fletcher.
I had to put up with your rumours on your own property.
I don't have to put up with it here.
You're a gutless wonder, Fisher.
You're not even man enough to admit what you're up to.
Which is?
You're trying to drive us out of the area, aren't you?
Now you really are being paranoid.
Good afternoon, Mr. Fletcher.
I should punch your face in.
You'd be up on an assault charge if you did.
Oh, I bet I would.
Unless you leave now I'll have you charged with trespass.
You like using the law to get your own way, do you?
Well, there's some decent people in Summer Bay Fisher and you can't influence all of them.
Enough to make your life difficult.
Now get out!
Hey, this is our home and it's Bobby's too.
You're not going to get away with it.
Ailse!
You've got to do us a big favour love, now.
You should have given us a ring.
We could have saved you the trip.
You're saying there's no truth in the letter.
That's what I'm saying.
- Well, is the girl here or isn't she?
- Yeah, she is.
Are you still having trouble finding a job?
- Yeah, sure I am!
- Is money tight?
That letter is a distortion of the facts.
The creep next door must have sent it.
He wants us out.
- Why does he want you out?
- Because he's a--
OK, Frank, I'll handle this one.
Look, this guy Fisher, he's a real little heckler.
I mean, we got on his wrong side by letting Bobby stay here and he wants out blood.
You make anything out of this you are really backing the bad guy.
Well, let's leave the good guys and bad guys stuff to the movies, eh.
Look, I'm here for the answers to two questions.
Are you still experiencing financial difficulties that could be detrimental to the children and two, is this Bobby Simpson a moral danger to them?
If the answer's are yes, no matter who sent the letter and for whatever reason,
I'm going to have to reassess your custody of the children.
You take our kids away, the effect will be ten times more disastrous than anything that could happen to them with us.
- The facts are--
- Facts.
I'll give you facts.
Frank here, a little street urchin.
A virtual resinous, but today, look at him and Carly, catatonic from parental abuse when she came to us.
- I know their cases!
- Lynn, run a way.
She's only ever ran away from us once and she can back of her own accord.
And what about little Sally, bewildered by the loss of her grandmother and look at her now.
Steven can actually sleep a full night without waking up screaming.
- This is not getting us anywhere.
- These are our kids, damnit.
They are the products of the love and the care that we've given them and you'll take them away over my dead body.
- Yes, yes.
- Hello.
Hope I haven't interrupted anything.
Well, yes, you have as a matter of fact.
I'm sorry.
I'm terribly sorry.
Of course I'll come back later.
I'll just wanted to leave you this.
- Well, what's that for?
- You've got the job, start tomorrow.
Just fill that in and bring it with you.
- Job, what job?
- Hello, I'm Ailsa Hogan.
I run the local store.
You can start tomorrow, can't you?
Of course he can.
We'll change our plans darling.
- What a relief.
- Well, that's settled.
I'll leave you with it.
That's all I came along to say.
After all you've done for Bobby a job is the least I can offer you.
She's one difficult kid, all right.
One of our local troublemakers.
They've done wonders with her.
Well, goodbye, Mr--
- Pearce.
- Yes.
Nice meeting you.
- Think he bought it.
- Of course he did.
I was listening.
You even had me believing you.
Tom nearly blew it.
What job.
Now all we have to do is wait.
- Why don't you just?
- Why don't you just leave?
What the hell's going on?
You might as well of-- How do you think you are?
Bobby, stop doing that!
Break it up the pair of you.
- Bobby, get up!
- No!
- Get here.
- Stand up!
- Get off her!
- Hey!
- She started it.
- I don't care who started it.
- That would be right, sweetheart.
- Stop it, both of you!
- We never wanted her in the first place.
- Carly.
- Carly.
- Well, we didn't.
- Carly.
- Everything's a mess now because of her.
You care more about hurting people than us.
- Who care's about you anyway?
- Yeah.
The whole town hates you.
Stop it, now stop it now!
I didn't know he was there.
Of course you didn't, sweetheart.
There, there, honey.
If he puts us in home now it's going be my fault.
- Shhh!
- I hate her, Pippa!
I hate Bobby!
- It will be all my fault.
- It will be all right.
Shhh!
Anyone for more toast?
Now, come on, you guys.
We're all acting like it's a foregone conclusions.
- It is.
- No, it's not.
- You saw him when he left.
- What will happen to me and Milco?
- It's OK, Sal.
- Look, he believed Ailsa about the job.
That's a start.
Come on.
We've got to look on the bright side.
Here, here, Bobby's done a bunk.
She left this.
- Where?
- I don't know!
She was there till late last night.
She reckons you'll all be better off without her here.
- Good riddance!
- Grow up!
- Yeah!
- Look, she doesn't care about us.
- She wouldn't have gone if she didn't.
- Right, you call her, Steve.
She can't have gone far.
She might not have left town for all we know.
Hey, come on, kids.
Get changed.
We're going to do a full search.
- What?
- Frank.
He called me Steve.
For the first time he called me by his proper name.
A breakthrough, eh.
Let's hope they get the chance to build on it.
Thanks.
- You can't go in there.
- Try and stop me.
- I tried to stop her.
- It's all right, Miss Purvis.
- Bobby, isn't it?
- You know it is!
- I can call security.
- It's all right!
- But--
- Really, Miss Purvis, it's fine.
Sit down.
No thanks.
It's too late for me, but those kids back there are OK, except Carly, and one out of fives not bad.
- Bobby, look--
- Shut up and listen.
My folks were no good and I hated them.
- I think--
- I said listen.
I used to dream about what sort of folks I'd like and
I reckon Tom and Pippa are just about what I dreamed off.
You take those kids away and stick them in some dumb home, you need your head read.
It doesn't matter how broke they get, those two will never let the kids suffer.
You don't have to worry about me.
I won't be there.
I've stuffed up my own life enough.
I'm not going to stuff up there.
I just hope you welfare blokes show a bit of sense for a change and leave them along.
That's it.
As soon as I realised she intended disappearing into the crowd,
I was out of the office and after her, but she had gone.
Maybe she'll just spend some time in the city and then come back.
She said, it's too late for me.
She's given up on herself.
All the more reason to find her.
Yeah, it will be downhill all the way for her.
You got it.
I can inform the police, but the trouble with that is, she's violated a bond.
She shouldn't have left the district without informing the local constable.
That means to help her we have to dob her in.
I don't think there's any choice.
What do you think will happen?
Depends on the circumstances when they catch up with her.
At worst she'll have her bond revoked and go to a home.
At best.
Look, this may seem inconsistent from the guy who huffed out of here the other day, but I read Bobby's file.
Anyone who can inspire that kid to go to the bother of tracking me down to make the speech she made to me.
You've done a pretty incredible job.
The best is we make her a ward of the state and allocate her to suitable foster parents.
If I can convince the court it's for her benefit, they'll buy it.
Now how do you feel about taking on another one?
Here they come.
Well, I'll get on to finding her, but as soon as we do I'll need you both in court.
Yeah, OK.
What's everyone looking so stressed about?
We got a reprieve.
We're still the Fletcher family.
Thanks, Mr. Pearce.
And there's one person we have to thank more than anyone else.
It's important you realise that, especially you, Carly.
Hey, this calls for a celebration.
Come on!
Hey, this better be good.
Is she all right?
Oh, great!
Yeah, ten o'clock.
Yeah, we'll be there.
Good!
- What was it?
- They've found her!
We've got to be in court tomorrow.
That's only three days.
That's pretty good going.
Let's hope the court sees it our way.
Lynn!
Lynn!
Pippa wants me to take a photo of them all when they arrive?
You know, Floss, if anyone can get Floss back on the right track, it's those.
That's what she's need all her life, you know.
To belong to a family.
You can't guarantee they'll get custody of her yet.
Well, let's look on the bright side, eh.
If there is a bright side.
Here.
Are you still worried about what you saw in those cards?
I saw what I saw.
Well, I'd understand why you were worried if I knew what it was.
Forget it eh?
Just forget it.
Stop being so mysterious.
Well, let's just say that if I'm right, if I'm right, it might be better if the judge doesn't give her too them.
Floss.
Death, all right.
I saw death.
Now, if I'm right, Bobby could be the death of one of them.
Look, I just want to forget about it.
What would I know anyway?
Silly little chook like me.
Hope you know what you've let yourselves in for.
I think we've got a fair idea!
And no way am I calling you mum and dad.
No way do we want you to.
You're all right, you know that.
Hey, isn't that Fisher over there?
- Are you going to stop?
- No.
Do you see what I see?
- Hey!
- I ahead of you.
Hey!
Hey, Tom.
Watch the--
- Puddle.
- I was watching it.
Ha ha!
He was aiming at it.
I'm back!
- Can I see you?
- You see me.
- Out here, alone.
- What is it, Carly?
Go on.
We'll wait.
- Any idea what she's up to?
- Knowing Carly's pride, yes.
Well, you can see what the sign says.
- Yeah.
I can read!
- Well, it goes for me to.
They're here!
Hi!
Come on, come on!
Up here!
We've got to get a picture of you.
Come on!
Littlies in front.
That's it.
That's it.
Steven, in a bit, in a bit.
That's it.
There.
Smile.

- God damn it.
Excuse me, sis--
- Marie.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Hi, Tom.
Good to see you.
- You know, it's not really your book I love.
It's the fact that you're the only client who's always on time.
- Thanks a lot.
- So anyway, now, Brimley Books, they're offering the most money upfront.
But they want the rights to this, your next book.
- Tom?
- Yes?
What?
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
- Well, I don't know if I feel comfortable locking it in like that.
I mean, it may very well be that Arrow will pay much larger for drafts.

MARIE NARRATING:
Dreams They're just dreams.
They're not real.
Just dreams.
[SCREAMING]
- Oh god.
[FOOTSTEPS]
- Richard, Richard, thank god it's you, Richard.
- It's just imagination, Doc.
It's how she writes her books.
Like she-- sees the stories in her mind or something.
- Yeah, maybe in the beginning.
This time, her imagination's gone too far.
You see, what you and your wife have got to face up to is the enormous pressure she's under as a best-selling author.
Do you want one?
- No, thanks.
Doc, this is kinda coming at a bad time.
For Marie.
She's got a deadline coming up on her new book, and it's-- it's kind of important to her.
- No, no, no.
That's not important.
What is important is her state of mind.
Her health should be your concern.
- It is my concern.
I just meant-- look, what do you suggest that we do, huh?
I mean, she can't just shut her mind off like a light.
- No.
But she could turn it down.
She needs to get away from all this excitement for a while.
She needs a rest.
And that means no work.
She needs to go somewhere where her imagination won't be stimulated.
- All right.
All right, I'll, uh, I'll find some place.
Thanks.
- Look at this.
- Hey.
What's that?
- That is where you're driving me.
It's almost terminally quaint, isn't it?
- Oh, it looks great to me.
Where'd you find it?
- Richard found it.
Actually, I think he did it for Pierre.
Isn't that right, baby?
Ah, Tom, smell that air.
Can you believe this?
I should have done this months ago, you know it?
- It'll be good for you two to get away together.
- Yep, it's what our marriage needs at the moment.
- How long are you gonna be away for?
- Three whole weeks.
Richard's gonna be driving back and forth to LA, though.
He's up for a big design job, did I tell you?
- No.
- Ah.
He really needs this.
I hope he gets it.
He's been on such a downer lately.
This would be great for him.
- Do you need any company while he's gone?
- No way.
You'd have me trying to write all the time.
Forget about it.
- Well, I was just trying to be helpful.
- Yeah, well, you've done enough already, thank you very much.
- Mind the mousse.
- Oh, excuse me.
Sorry.
- Tom, I don't know.
It could be left, could be right.
- Now what did I do?
- I don't know.
It sure the hell wasn't speeding.
- Well, now, just where is it we're trying to get to?
- Good afternoon, officer.
We're trying to find Drago.
- Drago, huh?
- Yeah.
She and her husband are renting a cottage there.
- You staying there too?
- No.
I'm a friend giving her a ride.
- Well, friend, you head on right.
A little ways along, there's a break to the left.
Now, you take that.
But if you get to the town, you've gone too far.
- Thank you, officer.
[GIGGLING]
- Ta-da!
Hey, baby.
- Hi.
- Tom, what a surprise.
I didn't expect to see you here.
- Yeah, it was a last-minute thing.
- Marie called to say goodbye.
- Tom politely volunteered, knowing I'd say no, of course, so I said yes.
- Well, wasn't that nice of you, Tom?
Look, can I get you a glass of champagne or something?
- Look, don't worry.
I gotta get going back to LA.
I mean, who knows, if I drink and drive,
I'll never find my way back.
- Hey, why don't you just stay here tonight?
I mean, it looks like we have plenty of room.
I'm sure--
- Look, Marie, if he's got to get back,
Tom's gotta get back, right?
- Look, uh, I'll see you when you get back in LA.
You two have a good time.
You take care of her.
- Don't worry, buddy.
I will.
- Look, if you need anything, just give me a call, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- No, I mean it.
- I'll be fine, OK?
I'll pin your number up on the wall just in case.
Of course, we don't have a phone, but-- see ya.
Drive safe.
- So what do you think?
- It's perfect.
[HOWLING]
- Richard?
- What?
- What was that noise?
- What noise?
- That howling?
- Probably just hearing the animal in me.
[HOWLING]
- That's really strange.
it's like time stood still, isn't it?
Where's all the kids and the-- the barking dogs and--
- I don't know.
Maybe they all went fishing.
- Wow.
- They're very beautiful, aren't they?
Have you seen anything you like?
- These are interesting.
Who's the artist?
- Me.
These-- these are all mine.
You're the couple staying at the cottage.
- Yeah, how did you know?
- News travels fast in a small town.
- Oh.
Well, hi.
I'm Marie.
This is my husband, Richard.
- I'm Eleanor.
- Well, we came into town for some countries, but I'd like to come back another time and get some materials.
Painting is a passion of mine too.
- Ormstead's Store is just across the way.
- Thank you.
- You have a nice shop.
- Oh, please stop by again when you have more time.
MARIE (OFFSCREEN):
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eh?
RICHARD (OFFSCREEN):
She's probably like that to everybody.
- Yeah.
You remember that, and you won't go wrong.
- Are you jealous?
- What, of a flirtatious shopkeeper?
Give me a break.
Should I be?
Huh?
- Visitors, Mr. O.
- I hear them, Mrs. O.
- Hello, there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Howdy.
Howdy.
- You must be the new couple running Wilderness Cottage, right?
Here on your honeymoon?
- More of a second honeymoon.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- We need a couple of things here.
- Oh.
- All right.
- Oh, this is quite a list you have here.
So, why don't you and me go get the things and have the ladies get acquainted?
- Great.
- OK.
- want to sit down, dear?
You'll be wanting to know what goes on in these parts.
Well, not much.
Folks keep pretty much to themselves around here.
We live our lives, mind around business-- except for me.
I mind everybody's business.
Morning sheriff.
Your cigarettes are on the counter.
- Is he always that friendly?
- Oh, had a little run in with him yesterday, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- The sheriff can be a little surly, but he's a good man to have on your side when trouble comes knocking.
- How did you know I met the sheriff yesterday?
- Oh, everybody knows everything about--
- About everybody around here.
Right.
[HOWLING]
- What?
Damn it.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
[HOWLING]
MARIE (OFFSCREEN):
Pierre?
Here boy.
[WHISTLING]
MARIE (OFFSCREEN):
Pierre!
Pierre!
Pierre?
[WHISTLING]
- God damn it, Richard, he's been missing all day.
- Marie, he is a dog.
He's probably out in the woods chasing rabbits or chipmunks or something.
The woods are heaven to a house dog.
There's no need to run and talk to the sheriff.
- [INAUDIBLE].
Good afternoon, sheriff.
My dog is missing.
It's a white poodle.
- Dogs run off all the time.
Folk around here don't get too concerned.
There's no big animals hereabouts.
- Then what's that howling?
- The only howling I ever heard was a coyote, and that was a good many years ago.
Well, do you think you can keep a lookout for him, please?
[GROWLING]
- Oh god.
Richard, what time is it?
- 7:15.
I have an 11:30 appointment with those design people down in LA, remember?
- Oh god, it's Tuesday, isn't it?
That's right.
- All day.
Look, I'll be back before sundown, OK?
- Oh, Pierre won't starve out there.
He'll be back just like a man with his tail between his legs.
You don't believe that, dear?
- I'd like to, Mrs. O. It's just that there's something so sinister about these woods.
Every night I've been hearing this howling.
- Well, it's probably just owls.
The woods are full of them.
- It sounds so evil, though.
- Things always sound scarier at night.
Why, Mr. O's snoring scares the bejesus out of me.
Don't let it worry you.
- I know.
It's probably nothing.
You're probably right.
Who used to live in the cottage?
- Oh, a lovely couple.
She was a dear.
Nothing was too much trouble for her.
And one day, they just up and left.
Never said a word.
I still miss them.
Well, it's time you were off.
It's going to get dark, and forests are tricky things.
I've noticed you don't drive.
- No.
Doctor's orders.
- Well, you better be off.
- Thank you for listening.
- All right.
- I'll see you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Who was she asking after?
- About the couple that had the cottage before them.
- Oh?
- Excuse me?
- Marie?
- I'm sorry.
I thought-
- I thought it was a--
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I just-
- I thought you were somebody else.
- You're going back to your cottage?
- Yeah.
- If you go that way, across the swing bridge, it's much quicker for you.
- Thanks.
Richard!
Richard!
- Marie, what is it?
What is it?
Now, calm down. what is it?
- Something's following me, Richard.
- What are you-- what are you talking about?
- Something's following me out there.
- Hey, Marie, what in the hell happened?
- I found Pierre.
I found just his head.
And then something was following me through the woods.
I could feel it.
- Marie, now, calm down.
Now, come on, explain to me what happened.
- It was in the cave by the swing bridge, you know?
And then something was following me, Richard.
I could feel him follow me all the way home.
He's out there.
I feel him.
- All right, honey.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Calm-- calm down.
I'm gonna go see.
- No, Richard, don't go.
- It's OK.
I'm gonna go see.
- Richard, don't go out there.
- Honey, it's OK.
- Don't leave me, Richard.
- It's OK.
I'm gonna go see.
It's OK.
I'm gonna get the doctor.
- Oh, Richard.
Tell me it'll be all right.
Just hold me, OK?
- Go away.
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Go away, my child.
[HONKING]
- Hi.
- Hi, are you Marie Adams?
- Yes.
- I'm Janice Hatch.
I'm, uh, here on vacation.
Well, actually over at the Twin Forks Hotel.
And I-
- I hope I'm not being too forward, but I'm a big fan of your books.
And when I heard you were down here,
I really wanted to meet you.
- Come on in.
I just made some coffee.
Come on.
- I'm not interrupting or anything?
- No.
Of course not.
Don't be silly.
Come on.
[BELLS RINGING]
- Hello, Richard.
- I was just, uh, passing by.
And I thought-- well, I remembered that my wife wanted some artists' supplies.
- So?
- It was a great book, but how do you keep all those characters and complicated events straight?
- It's hard to explain.
I see it in my mind, almost as if it's real.
- Anything else?
- I thought maybe a present.
- Something special?
- Something like this.
- You have very good taste.
It's got great detail.
- I just love it here during the day.
During the night, though, I get so scared.
I keep hearing these sounds that really frighten me.
It's probably because I'm just a city girl.
- What sounds?
- Well, it's like these howling sounds.
- Howling?
- Yeah, have you heard that?
- Me?
No.
No, but a friend of mine used those same words.
- What, she heard it here?
- I'm not sure.
- Well, what?
What'd she say?
- Well, until recently I-
- I was a nun.
I had a very close friend in the convent, Sister Ruth.
She disappeared a year ago last February.
Two weeks later, the Mother Superior called me and said sister Ruth had been found in Drago.
She was almost incoherent and babbling on about finding the devil and the sound of bells and-- and then the howling.
She was never able to tell us what happened.
She was very frail.
She refused to eat, and a month ago she died.
I left the convent and came here.
I had to find out what happened.
- Have you?
- All I know is, the sheriff here said he found her wandering in the woods.
- And you think that Sister Ruth heard the same sounds as I did, right?
- I don't know, but she used those same words.
- Janice, do you mind if I help you find out what happened?
MARIE (OFFSCREEN):
Thanks for my present.
I love it.
It's beautiful.
I see you went back to the big, bad wolf again, huh?
- Hey, picked it out.
- I'm just kidding.
- I have something I gotta show you.
- What?
- I found this.
- I didn't imagine it, Richard.
- Honey, I practically searched the whole area on my knees.
And this is all I could find.
The light can play tricks on you, and you've got to admit, this doesn't look like a dog's head.
- You think he's still alive, then?
- Let's hope so.
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Hi.
- You don't know what bit you, huh?
- No.
- Your ankle's starting to swell a little bit.
OK, is that too tight, Paula?
- No, that feels fine.
- OK.
- You a doctor?
- God no.
I did do a year in medical school, though.
I'm qualified for a bandage, but that's about it.
You guys aren't from around here, are you?
- No.
New York.
Driving and hiking through California.
- John's idea of a hike is a forced march.
- We came to see the bell tower in Drago.
- The bell tower?
- Yeah.
It's a replica of a 16th century bell tower from Europe, and the bell is the original.
Quite a history behind it.
Evidently, the bell was rung to summons the townspeople, and when they were all inside, the tower was burned down.
Apparently there were no survivors.
- Is that a true story?
- Yeah, well, I read it in an old "National Geographic."
You OK, honey?
I think we should be going now.
- Listen, my husband will be back soon.
Why don't you guys just stick around, and we'll drive you back into town.
- Look, thanks for your help, but my Chevy camper's parked close by.
- OK.
Make sure you see the doctor in Drago, though, OK?
- Will do.
- That could get infected.
- Thanks again.
- Listen, have you guys seen a little white poodle?
I lost him a couple of days ago.
I think he might be in the woods.
- No, afraid not.
But if we see him, we'll bring him to you.
- You OK, hon?
- No problem.
[DOG WHIMPER]
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what is it?
- Maybe it's Marie's dog.
It sounds like it's hurt.
I'm going to check it out.
[GROWLING]
[GROWLING]
- John!
[SCREAMING]
[SCREAMING]
[RIFLE SHOT]
- Boil the water, honey.
The man done brung home the bacon.
I picked this up while I was in LA.
I thought it might make you feel a little bit safer.
All right.
All right, I-
- I promise.
Tomorrow night I shoot a chicken instead.
- Tomorrow night, let's go out for dinner.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[HOWLING]
- Did you hear that, Richard?
Richard, you heard that, didn't you?
- Yeah.
I heard it, but it was prob--
- No, no.
No buts, Richard.
You heard that.
You see?
I told you I didn't imagine it.
Marie, it was probably a coyote.
Maybe he's in heat.
You coming up?
- I'm just gonna finish the dishes first.
- Now I know why they invented paper plates.
- I'll be up in a minute.
Sister Ruth?
Sister Ruth?
- Don't hurt them!
Don't hurt them!
[GROWLING]
- Hey, Richard?
You think you could make this your last trip to LA?
I don't know what they expect from you.
I-- you've practically done the whole job already.
- I know, Marie.
But if that's what it takes, that's what it-- that's what it takes.
Look, Marie, if I get this job, it jumps me into a whole new league, and then they're going to be coming to see me.
- I know.
- Look, I'm sorry.
Tell your friend Janice, I-
- I don't mean to be rude.
I gotta go.
- I know.
OK, I'll see you this afternoon, all right?
- You bet.
- I love you.
- Yeah.
All right, wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I saw Sister Ruth last night.
- What?
- I know this gonna sound crazy.
Maybe it is, but I saw her here.
And the expression on her face was like something horrible was happening right here in my living room, like-
- I don't know what.
I told you, I have quite an imagination.
And there's something else too.
These hikers I met yesterday told me about the bell tower in Drago.
Didn't you say something about Sister Ruth and the sound of bells?
The bell is original from Europe.
16th century.
- Let's take a look.
- Uh, nothing to see down there.
It's dangerous.
Fire hazard.
It's been condemned.
The whole place is infested with termites.
- What was it for?
- Oh, fire alarm.
They'd ring that bell when there was a fire, and everybody would come running.
A sight you wouldn't believe.
Well, come on, girls.
You'll get yourselves hurt down there.
- Who's that?
- That was Mrs. Ormstead.
She owns the general store there.
She's really nice.
Stop.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you taking that camper?
- County impound.
It's an abandoned vehicle.
- No, it's not.
It belongs to some friends of mine.
- Ma'am, we found it out in the forest road.
Sheriff told me to haul it out of here, and that's what I'm a-doing.
- Where's the sheriff.
SHERIFF (OFFSCREEN):
You have a problem, ma'am?
- That camper there, I know who owns it.
- That's good, because no one else does.
It's got no license plates, no papers.
It was found up in the woods.
Probably been there a week now.
- No, no, no.
This couple I met yesterday, it's theirs.
- Well, then, your friends ain't got much respect for their own property, because in this territory, we call it an abandoned vehicle.
Now, excuse me, ma'am, I got a lot of work to do.
Move it on out.
- What was all that about?
- Remember that couple I told you I met yesterday?
They said they had a Chevy camper.
- Without license plates?
- Something's happened to them, I know it.
OK, look, you just hang out here, OK?
And warn me if anybody comes around.
- Marie!
Marie!
Sheriff.
Did you find anything?
- New York license plates.
That camper did belong to my friends.
I told Paula to see the doctor here.
Let's see if she did.
- Oh no.
No your couple came by here.
Perhaps they hitched a lift to Twin Forks Hospital.
- Thanks for your help, doctor.
- I'm sorry I couldn't do more.
- Doctor, about a year ago, you treated a nun.
Her name was Sister Ruth.
The sheriff said you might be able to give us some information about her?
- Yes.
Sister Ruth.
Terrible.
Terrible thing.
She was found wandering in the woods, near catatonic.
- In the woods?
Hm.
The sheriff said she was found at my place, at Wilderness Cottage.
- Now, as I recall, the sheriff found her in the woods.
- Janice was a very close friend of hers, and I was reading about her case-- me being a writer and everything.
- Oh, of course.
You're our visiting celebrity author.
Well, if I can be of any more help, don't hesitate to stop by.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Why did you mention Wilderness Cottage?
Is it because you saw Sister Ruth there?
- Yeah, somehow Ruth and the cottage are connected.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Yeah, hello?
MARIE (OFFSCREEN):
Hello, Tom?
Hi, it's Marie.
Tom, can you do me a favor?
I'm working on a real mystery here.
We'll talk about my health another time, OK?
Just listen to me.
You know that little friend of yours in the DA's office?
If I give you a New York license number, could you find out whether it belongs to a John Simmons or Paula Johnson?
- Sure.
- Did Sister Ruth say anything when you saw her in the hospital?
- I couldn't make any sense out of what she was saying.
I barely recognized her.
The only thing she said was-- well, it sounded like, we are all in fear.
I don't know what terrified her so.
But the devil must have touched her.
Because after that, she-- never became normal again.
- When you found her in the hospital, did they say whether or not they found her in the woods or in the cottage?
- That I can't remember.
- Marie things she might have been in the cottage she's renting.
- Well, that I don't know.
I remember she was suffering from an exposure in parts.
Maybe she was in the woods and sought refuge in your cottage.
- Father, there's no church in Drago.
Your parish here in Twin Forks must be the closest one.
Do any of them ever come here to your services?
- No.
- Isn't that unusual?
- It is strange.
But the people from Drago are a community unto themselves.
They have been for as long as I remember.
Well, I'm here if you need me.
God be with you.
- Are you gonna tell Richard what we're doing?
- What, are you kidding?
He thinks I'm on the edge already.
[HOWLING]
- Richard.
[SCREAMING]
- Richard, they've killed them.
They've killed them.
I swear.
- Marie.
Marie!
Marie.
It was a dream, Marie.
A bad dream.
All right, let's do it like I said.
- OK.
- Squeeze it up right in your arm like that.
Look through the sight.
- Got it.
- Give it a shot.
Ah!
Damn.
- OK, now line it up with the thing right in your shoulder, and you look right through the sight--
- Hand of God, I guess.
MARIE (OFFSCREEN):
I guess.
- I'd love to be able to live in a place like this.
How did you find it?
- I lucked out.
I ran into the developer that owns the place-- funny guy.
I guess it's been empty for about a year.
February, I think.
- Did he say who lived in it before?
- Some old couple.
Why?
What are you two up to?
- No reason.
Just curious.
Doesn't it seem like quite a coincidence?
I mean, Sister Ruth arrives at about the same time the couple leaves?
- I'm going to run into town.
We're low on supplies.
- Oh, you want me to come with you?
- No, no.
It's a one-man job.
- OK.
Bye.
- I might stop in the bar and grab a drink.
- OK.
[WOOD CRUNCHING]
[WOOD CRUNCHING]
[GROWLING]
[GROWLING]
[SCREAMING]
- I shot at a wolf, Ri-
- Richard.
It was outside.
- Give me the gun.
I'm going to go look.
Give me the gun.
Stay here, OK?
Damn.
Son of a bitch.
- Did you see anything?
Janice, it's all coming apart.
I can't even believe what I see anymore.
- I believe you.
I checked back into the history of Drago.
The bell in that tower came from a village called Draga, a village in Romania.
Do you know why all the villagers died in that fire, the fire that burned down the bell tower?
People in a nearby community burned them alive.
They believed one of the villagers from Drago was a werewolf.
- A werewolf, Janice?
Oh, come on.
- It sounds crazy, but that's what they believed.
You know, the church still accepts the existence of the devil.
And werewolves, which are another form of the devil, have been recorded for centuries.
- Janice, I shot a wolf, OK?
Or something that looked like a wolf.
It wasn't some devil.
- But Marie-- but if there had been some form of werewolf, and if Sister Ruth saw--
- OK, just stop it, all right?
Just stop it right there.
Whatever caused Sister Ruth to lose it was real, all right?
Don't you get it?
It wasn't some mythical, mystical devil incarnate.
Janice, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I just-
- I don't know anything anymore.
- More questions about Sister Ruth?
- No.
No, it's about me.
I haven't been able to sleep very much, and I thought maybe you could refill my Valium prescription.
- That should be easy to fix.
- Doctor, I shot at a wolf last night.
[GASPING]
- A wolf?
Marie, are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Well, I'm not exactly positive I shot at a wolf, but something tried to attack me last night.
- I've never heard of a wolf in these parts.
Perhaps it was a raccoon.
They're the most persistent scavengers around.
They can be pretty mean at night, easy to mistake.
- That had to be the biggest raccoon I've ever seen.
- Shadows do things.
If you haven't been sleeping, perhaps your mind just, well, probably over-reacted.
- I've been having some pretty wild dreams.
I even thought that the house was haunted by the people who used to live there.
I saw them.
It was like they were trying to warn me about something.
- Don't worry.
There's nothing in the forest or in your house to harm you.
Although I think I ought to warn you that your stairs have already claimed a victim.
The previous resident fell down them and damaged his hip.
- Is that why they left Drago?
- Mm-hmm.
He needed specialist treatment.
They went off to some famous Jewish hospital in New York.
Take one of those, a half hour before going to bed, huh?
- Thank you, Doctor.
I think I needed your advice as much as I needed these.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Uh, hello.
- Tom, hi.
It's Marie.
Any luck with that license plate?
- Uh, yes, but it wasn't registered under, uh-- what were the names you gave me?
Johnson and Simmons.
It was registered under the name of Brooks.
- Tom, listen, let me ask you something serious now, OK?
Don't laugh.
Do you believe in werewolves?
- Yeah, only in the late show though.
- You're not being very serious.
- Well, I certainly hurt you're not.
Look, is this the real mystery you're working on?
- No, of course not.
I just asked because there's a legend about werewolves in this town.
- Ah, a werewolf story.
Well, maybe that is a good idea.
- Tom.
Tom, I am on vacation.
OK, Tom.
Thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
- We struck out.
The license plates weren't theirs.
I think it's time I talked to Richard.
- Are you sure that's what you want to do?
- Nope.
- How much more am I supposed to take?
You put together a few bad dreams and a frustrated lesbian, and you come up with howling werewolves and demented nuns.
Christ, you even involved Tom behind my back.
- Richard, I know that this sounds very strange--
- No, this doesn't sound strange, Marie.
It is strange.
You know, I blame myself for this.
I really do.
I blame myself for going down to LA and leaving you hear alone.
You were supposed to be resting, Marie.
You weren't supposed to be running around with Janice like a couple of Ghostbusters.
No wonder your dreams are getting worse.
[HOWLING]
- Richard, did you hear that?
- That's it, Marie.
That is it.
Tomorrow I'm taking you back to LA, and we're getting you to see a shrink.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out, Marie.
I need some air, all right?
Werewolves.
[GROWLING]
- Richard.
Richard.
Oh.
Come on.
It's gonna be all right, OK?
OK.
Here.
I'm going for the doctor.
- No.
No.
Don't go out there.
It's still out there.
Hide.
- He'll be OK.
A few scratches, bump on the head.
It's not a concussion.
- But his shoulder, the bite marks.
- Bite marks?
There weren't any bite marks.
Just a few scratches.
- Doctor, Richard was attacked by a wolf.
- He fell down a gully, Marie.
- Excuse me.
- Richard?
Your shoulder.
You said you were attacked by a wolf.
- A wolf, Marie?
I fell down a gully onto some rocks.
It's just a scratch.
- Last night, he told me that he was attacked by a wolf.
- He was probably a little delirious from the fall.
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Well, goodbye.
- Bye.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Father, do you have a book on exorcism?
- Exorcism, Janice?
- Yes.
The Roman rituals book.
- Sister Ruth asked me about that book.
- Did you lend it to her?
- No.
And it's not here.
Maybe she just took it.
- You don't think she was planning to do an exorcism.
- Oh, no.
No, she would know, as you know, only priests can perform exorcisms.
You know, I don't ever recall seeing that book again.
Oh, by the way, I have the bible Sister Ruth left at the church here.
- May I keep it, father?
- Don't see why not.
- Thank you.
It means a great deal to me.
- Richard, what are you doing?
- I'm going out.
- You should be resting in bed.
- It's OK, Marie.
I feel great.
- Look, Janice, this whole Sister Ruth thing,
I should never have said that I would help you.
I had a nervous breakdown in LA.
I couldn't tell what was real and what was dreams.
Last night, I even imagined that Richard was attacked by a wolf.
My doctor sent me here to rest, and instead,
I'm trying to solve some mystery that probably isn't.
- Are you saying that you-- you imagined everything that's happened?
- Dreams.
That's-- that's all they were.
It was nothing supernatural, no ESP-- they were just dreams.
That's it.
- And the vision of Sister Ruth?
- I don't know.
All I know is that Richard fell down a gully and banged himself up.
And I convinced myself that he was attacked by a wolf.
I even bandaged the bite on his shoulder.
It took both Richard and the doctor to convince me that there was no bite.
It was all in my mind.
Tom.
Hi, Tom.
Come on in.
Come on.
- Uh, Janice, this is Tom Billings.
- So you're Janice.
- Yeah.
- Did I interrupt something?
- No.
No, I-
- I better go.
I, uh-
- I have to get back to the hotel at Twin Forks.
Well, bye, Marie.
- Bye, Janice.
- Uh, is it something I said?
- No.
I said too much.
So, the real mystery was unreal, huh?
- Yep, I'm afraid so.
I got all confused, and I brought you up here for no reason.
I'm sorry.
- You son of a bitch.
Get out.
- Richard, Tom didn't mean anything by that.
- Get out.
[KNOCKING]
- Tom.
- I came to talk to you about Marie.
- Come on in.
It was all my fault.
I-
- I was trying to find out what happened to my friend, Sister Ruth.
I got Marie involved and put all kinds of thoughts into her head.
- You mean that werewolf nonsense?
- That and many other things.
- But what about the license plates?
- It was all part of it.
- Yeah, she even got the names wrong.
The license plates belonged to somebody called Brooks.
- Brooks?
But that couldn't be.
That was Sister Ruth's last name.
Sister Ruth Brooks.
Well, then, that old couple that rented the cottage--
That is Sister Ruth's father.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
- That's why Sister Ruth came here-- to see her parents.
She lost contact with them when she became a nun.
She must have found out they were in Drago.
- Well, what about the license plates?
- Don't you see?
They never left town.
Everybody we talked to said they went back to New York.
- Well, why would they say that?
- Because they're trying to hide something.
Something happened to them, and Sister Ruth must have discovered it.
- And now you and Marie kept digging around here.
It sounds like Ruth's parents were murdered and probably the hitchhikers as well.
But I still don't understand why.
- The townspeople are trying to hide some secret.
Marie saw it in her visions.
She's in danger.
- Look, I'm gonna tell Marie and Richard to leave Drago tonight.
- I'm coming with you.
- Why should you think it's any different for you?
I'm going to drive you back to your hotel.
I want you to pack and leave today.
Come on.
- We are all in fear.
- What?
- Nothing, just something Sister Ruth said.
- It'll be good to get back to LA, won't it?
Guess I'm really just a city girl at heart.
I'll pack right after dinner, OK?
- I can't go yet.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
- Well, when, then?
- I don't know when.
Christ, Marie.
Will you stop hassling me?
- The devil's hatred for God has turned man into a habitation for demons.
Demons?
Werewolves.
We're in fear.
We're all in fear.
- We're all in fear.
- We're all in fear.
JANICE (OFFSCREEN):
Werewolves.
- We're all in fear.
JANICE (OFFSCREEN):
Demons.
- We're all in fear.
We're all in fear.
JANICE (OFFSCREEN):
All in fear.
- We're all in fear.
Werewolves in here.
Werewolves in here.
Werewolves in here.
JANICE (OFFSCREEN):
Werewolves?
- Werewolves in here.
JANICE (OFFSCREEN):
Werewolves?
Werewolves?
Oh God!
- Oh!
[GROANING] Don't
[GROWLING]
[HOWLING]
[HOWLING]
- Richard?
- (MUFFLED) Run, Marie.
DEMON VOICES (OFFSCREEN):
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls you.
Satan calls you.
Satan calls you.
Satan calls you.
[SCREAMING]
[HOWLING]
- Come on.
Come on!
Get started!
Start, damn it.
Start!
[SCREAMING]
JANICE (OFFSCREEN):
Marie!
Marie!
- Werewolves.
- Ruth was trying to warn us.
[GUNFIRE]
- The tower.
Run!
Doctor!
- You were right, Janice.
We are werewolves.
[SCREAMING]
- We must destroy them according to the legend.
The tower must be burnt with the werewolves inside.
You must set it on fire.
- What about you?
- I must ring the bell to summon the werewolves.
Go now.
Quick, before they get both of us.
Go!
God give me strength.
[BELL RINGING]
[GROANING]
[HOWLING]
[SCREAMING]
MARIE (OFFSCREEN):
Richard?
Richard.
[SCREAMING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- God damn it.
Excuse me, sis--
- Marie.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Hi, Tom.
Good to see you.
- You know, it's not really your book I love.
It's the fact that you're the only client who's always on time.
- Thanks a lot.
- So anyway, now, Brimley Books, they're offering the most money upfront.
But they want the rights to this, your next book.
- Tom?
- Yes?
What?
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
- Well, I don't know if I feel comfortable locking it in like that.
I mean, it may very well be that Arrow will pay much larger for drafts.
Dreams They're just dreams.
They're not real.
Just dreams.
- Oh god.
- Richard, Richard, thank god it's you, Richard.
- It's just imagination, Doc.
It's how she writes her books.
Like she-- sees the stories in her mind or something.
- Yeah, maybe in the beginning.
This time, her imagination's gone too far.
You see, what you and your wife have got to face up to is the enormous pressure she's under as a best-selling author.
Do you want one?
- No, thanks.
Doc, this is kinda coming at a bad time.
For Marie.
She's got a deadline coming up on her new book, and it's-- it's kind of important to her.
- No, no, no.
That's not important.
What is important is her state of mind.
Her health should be your concern.
- It is my concern.
I just meant-- look, what do you suggest that we do, huh?
I mean, she can't just shut her mind off like a light.
- No.
But she could turn it down.
She needs to get away from all this excitement for a while.
She needs a rest.
And that means no work.
She needs to go somewhere where her imagination won't be stimulated.
- All right.
All right, I'll, uh, I'll find some place.
Thanks.
- Look at this.
- Hey.
What's that?
- That is where you're driving me.
It's almost terminally quaint, isn't it?
- Oh, it looks great to me.
Where'd you find it?
- Richard found it.
Actually, I think he did it for Pierre.
Isn't that right, baby?
Ah, Tom, smell that air.
Can you believe this?
I should have done this months ago, you know it?
- It'll be good for you two to get away together.
- Yep, it's what our marriage needs at the moment.
- How long are you gonna be away for?
- Three whole weeks.
Richard's gonna be driving back and forth to LA, though.
He's up for a big design job, did I tell you?
- No.
- Ah.
He really needs this.
I hope he gets it.
He's been on such a downer lately.
This would be great for him.
- Do you need any company while he's gone?
- No way.
You'd have me trying to write all the time.
Forget about it.
- Well, I was just trying to be helpful.
- Yeah, well, you've done enough already, thank you very much.
- Mind the mousse.
- Oh, excuse me.
Sorry.
- Tom, I don't know.
It could be left, could be right.
- Now what did I do?
- I don't know.
It sure the hell wasn't speeding.
- Well, now, just where is it we're trying to get to?
- Good afternoon, officer.
We're trying to find Drago.
- Drago, huh?
- Yeah.
She and her husband are renting a cottage there.
- You staying there too?
- No.
I'm a friend giving her a ride.
- Well, friend, you head on right.
A little ways along, there's a break to the left.
Now, you take that.
But if you get to the town, you've gone too far.
- Thank you, officer.
- Ta-da!
Hey, baby.
- Hi.
- Tom, what a surprise.
I didn't expect to see you here.
- Yeah, it was a last-minute thing.
- Marie called to say goodbye.
- Tom politely volunteered, knowing I'd say no, of course, so I said yes.
- Well, wasn't that nice of you, Tom?
Look, can I get you a glass of champagne or something?
- Look, don't worry.
I gotta get going back to LA.
I mean, who knows, if I drink and drive,
I'll never find my way back.
- Hey, why don't you just stay here tonight?
I mean, it looks like we have plenty of room.
I'm sure--
- Look, Marie, if he's got to get back,
Tom's gotta get back, right?
- Look, uh, I'll see you when you get back in LA.
You two have a good time.
You take care of her.
- Don't worry, buddy.
I will.
- Look, if you need anything, just give me a call, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- No, I mean it.
- I'll be fine, OK?
I'll pin your number up on the wall just in case.
Of course, we don't have a phone, but-- see ya.
Drive safe.
- So what do you think?
- It's perfect.
- Richard?
- What?
- What was that noise?
- What noise?
- That howling?
- Probably just hearing the animal in me.
- That's really strange.
it's like time stood still, isn't it?
Where's all the kids and the-- the barking dogs and--
- I don't know.
Maybe they all went fishing.
- Wow.
- They're very beautiful, aren't they?
Have you seen anything you like?
- These are interesting.
Who's the artist?
- Me.
These-- these are all mine.
You're the couple staying at the cottage.
- Yeah, how did you know?
- News travels fast in a small town.
- Oh.
Well, hi.
I'm Marie.
This is my husband, Richard.
- I'm Eleanor.
- Well, we came into town for some countries, but I'd like to come back another time and get some materials.
Painting is a passion of mine too.
- Ormstead's Store is just across the way.
- Thank you.
- You have a nice shop.
- Oh, please stop by again when you have more time.
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eh?
She's probably like that to everybody.
- Yeah.
You remember that, and you won't go wrong.
- Are you jealous?
- What, of a flirtatious shopkeeper?
Give me a break.
Should I be?
Huh?
- Visitors, Mr. O.
- I hear them, Mrs. O.
- Hello, there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Howdy.
Howdy.
- You must be the new couple running Wilderness Cottage, right?
Here on your honeymoon?
- More of a second honeymoon.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- We need a couple of things here.
- Oh.
- All right.
- Oh, this is quite a list you have here.
So, why don't you and me go get the things and have the ladies get acquainted?
- Great.
- OK.
- want to sit down, dear?
You'll be wanting to know what goes on in these parts.
Well, not much.
Folks keep pretty much to themselves around here.
We live our lives, mind around business-- except for me.
I mind everybody's business.
Morning sheriff.
Your cigarettes are on the counter.
- Is he always that friendly?
- Oh, had a little run in with him yesterday, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- The sheriff can be a little surly, but he's a good man to have on your side when trouble comes knocking.
- How did you know I met the sheriff yesterday?
- Oh, everybody knows everything about--
- About everybody around here.
Right.
- What?
Damn it.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Pierre?
Here boy.
Pierre!
Pierre!
Pierre?
- God damn it, Richard, he's been missing all day.
- Marie, he is a dog.
He's probably out in the woods chasing rabbits or chipmunks or something.
The woods are heaven to a house dog.
There's no need to run and talk to the sheriff.
Good afternoon, sheriff.
My dog is missing.
It's a white poodle.
- Dogs run off all the time.
Folk around here don't get too concerned.
There's no big animals hereabouts.
- Then what's that howling?
- The only howling I ever heard was a coyote, and that was a good many years ago.
Well, do you think you can keep a lookout for him, please?
- Oh god.
Richard, what time is it?
- 7:15.
I have an 11:30 appointment with those design people down in LA, remember?
- Oh god, it's Tuesday, isn't it?
That's right.
- All day.
Look, I'll be back before sundown, OK?
- Oh, Pierre won't starve out there.
He'll be back just like a man with his tail between his legs.
You don't believe that, dear?
- I'd like to, Mrs. O. It's just that there's something so sinister about these woods.
Every night I've been hearing this howling.
- Well, it's probably just owls.
The woods are full of them.
- It sounds so evil, though.
- Things always sound scarier at night.
Why, Mr. O's snoring scares the bejesus out of me.
Don't let it worry you.
- I know.
It's probably nothing.
You're probably right.
Who used to live in the cottage?
- Oh, a lovely couple.
She was a dear.
Nothing was too much trouble for her.
And one day, they just up and left.
Never said a word.
I still miss them.
Well, it's time you were off.
It's going to get dark, and forests are tricky things.
I've noticed you don't drive.
- No.
Doctor's orders.
- Well, you better be off.
- Thank you for listening.
- All right.
- I'll see you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Who was she asking after?
- About the couple that had the cottage before them.
- Oh?
- Excuse me?
- Marie?
- I'm sorry.
I thought-
- I thought it was a--
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I just-
- I thought you were somebody else.
- You're going back to your cottage?
- Yeah.
- If you go that way, across the swing bridge, it's much quicker for you.
- Thanks.
Richard!
Richard!
- Marie, what is it?
What is it?
Now, calm down. what is it?
- Something's following me, Richard.
- What are you-- what are you talking about?
- Something's following me out there.
- Hey, Marie, what in the hell happened?
- I found Pierre.
I found just his head.
And then something was following me through the woods.
I could feel it.
- Marie, now, calm down.
Now, come on, explain to me what happened.
- It was in the cave by the swing bridge, you know?
And then something was following me, Richard.
I could feel him follow me all the way home.
He's out there.
I feel him.
- All right, honey.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Calm-- calm down.
I'm gonna go see.
- No, Richard, don't go.
- It's OK.
I'm gonna go see.
- Richard, don't go out there.
- Honey, it's OK.
- Don't leave me, Richard.
- It's OK.
I'm gonna go see.
It's OK.
I'm gonna get the doctor.
- Oh, Richard.
Tell me it'll be all right.
Just hold me, OK?
- Go away.
Go away, my child.
- Hi.
- Hi, are you Marie Adams?
- Yes.
- I'm Janice Hatch.
I'm, uh, here on vacation.
Well, actually over at the Twin Forks Hotel.
And I-
- I hope I'm not being too forward, but I'm a big fan of your books.
And when I heard you were down here,
I really wanted to meet you.
- Come on in.
I just made some coffee.
Come on.
- I'm not interrupting or anything?
- No.
Of course not.
Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Hello, Richard.
- I was just, uh, passing by.
And I thought-- well, I remembered that my wife wanted some artists' supplies.
- So?
- It was a great book, but how do you keep all those characters and complicated events straight?
- It's hard to explain.
I see it in my mind, almost as if it's real.
- Anything else?
- I thought maybe a present.
- Something special?
- Something like this.
- You have very good taste.
It's got great detail.
- I just love it here during the day.
During the night, though, I get so scared.
I keep hearing these sounds that really frighten me.
It's probably because I'm just a city girl.
- What sounds?
- Well, it's like these howling sounds.
- Howling?
- Yeah, have you heard that?
- Me?
No.
No, but a friend of mine used those same words.
- What, she heard it here?
- I'm not sure.
- Well, what?
What'd she say?
- Well, until recently I-
- I was a nun.
I had a very close friend in the convent, Sister Ruth.
She disappeared a year ago last February.
Two weeks later, the Mother Superior called me and said sister Ruth had been found in Drago.
She was almost incoherent and babbling on about finding the devil and the sound of bells and-- and then the howling.
She was never able to tell us what happened.
She was very frail.
She refused to eat, and a month ago she died.
I left the convent and came here.
I had to find out what happened.
- Have you?
- All I know is, the sheriff here said he found her wandering in the woods.
- And you think that Sister Ruth heard the same sounds as I did, right?
- I don't know, but she used those same words.
- Janice, do you mind if I help you find out what happened?
Thanks for my present.
I love it.
It's beautiful.
I see you went back to the big, bad wolf again, huh?
- Hey, picked it out.
- I'm just kidding.
- I have something I gotta show you.
- What?
- I found this.
- I didn't imagine it, Richard.
- Honey, I practically searched the whole area on my knees.
And this is all I could find.
The light can play tricks on you, and you've got to admit, this doesn't look like a dog's head.
- You think he's still alive, then?
- Let's hope so.
Hi.
- You don't know what bit you, huh?
- No.
- Your ankle's starting to swell a little bit.
OK, is that too tight, Paula?
- No, that feels fine.
- OK.
- You a doctor?
- God no.
I did do a year in medical school, though.
I'm qualified for a bandage, but that's about it.
You guys aren't from around here, are you?
- No.
New York.
Driving and hiking through California.
- John's idea of a hike is a forced march.
- We came to see the bell tower in Drago.
- The bell tower?
- Yeah.
It's a replica of a 16th century bell tower from Europe, and the bell is the original.
Quite a history behind it.
Evidently, the bell was rung to summons the townspeople, and when they were all inside, the tower was burned down.
Apparently there were no survivors.
- Is that a true story?
- Yeah, well, I read it in an old "National Geographic."
You OK, honey?
I think we should be going now.
- Listen, my husband will be back soon.
Why don't you guys just stick around, and we'll drive you back into town.
- Look, thanks for your help, but my Chevy camper's parked close by.
- OK.
Make sure you see the doctor in Drago, though, OK?
- Will do.
- That could get infected.
- Thanks again.
- Listen, have you guys seen a little white poodle?
I lost him a couple of days ago.
I think he might be in the woods.
- No, afraid not.
But if we see him, we'll bring him to you.
- You OK, hon?
- No problem.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what is it?
- Maybe it's Marie's dog.
It sounds like it's hurt.
I'm going to check it out.
- John!
- Boil the water, honey.
The man done brung home the bacon.
I picked this up while I was in LA.
I thought it might make you feel a little bit safer.
All right.
All right, I-
- I promise.
Tomorrow night I shoot a chicken instead.
- Tomorrow night, let's go out for dinner.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.
- Did you hear that, Richard?
Richard, you heard that, didn't you?
- Yeah.
I heard it, but it was prob--
- No, no.
No buts, Richard.
You heard that.
You see?
I told you I didn't imagine it.
Marie, it was probably a coyote.
Maybe he's in heat.
You coming up?
- I'm just gonna finish the dishes first.
- Now I know why they invented paper plates.
- I'll be up in a minute.
Sister Ruth?
Sister Ruth?
- Don't hurt them!
Don't hurt them!
- Hey, Richard?
You think you could make this your last trip to LA?
I don't know what they expect from you.
I-- you've practically done the whole job already.
- I know, Marie.
But if that's what it takes, that's what it-- that's what it takes.
Look, Marie, if I get this job, it jumps me into a whole new league, and then they're going to be coming to see me.
- I know.
- Look, I'm sorry.
Tell your friend Janice, I-
- I don't mean to be rude.
I gotta go.
- I know.
OK, I'll see you this afternoon, all right?
- You bet.
- I love you.
- Yeah.
All right, wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I saw Sister Ruth last night.
- What?
- I know this gonna sound crazy.
Maybe it is, but I saw her here.
And the expression on her face was like something horrible was happening right here in my living room, like-
- I don't know what.
I told you, I have quite an imagination.
And there's something else too.
These hikers I met yesterday told me about the bell tower in Drago.
Didn't you say something about Sister Ruth and the sound of bells?
The bell is original from Europe.
16th century.
- Let's take a look.
- Uh, nothing to see down there.
It's dangerous.
Fire hazard.
It's been condemned.
The whole place is infested with termites.
- What was it for?
- Oh, fire alarm.
They'd ring that bell when there was a fire, and everybody would come running.
A sight you wouldn't believe.
Well, come on, girls.
You'll get yourselves hurt down there.
- Who's that?
- That was Mrs. Ormstead.
She owns the general store there.
She's really nice.
Stop.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you taking that camper?
- County impound.
It's an abandoned vehicle.
- No, it's not.
It belongs to some friends of mine.
- Ma'am, we found it out in the forest road.
Sheriff told me to haul it out of here, and that's what I'm a-doing.
- Where's the sheriff.
You have a problem, ma'am?
- That camper there, I know who owns it.
- That's good, because no one else does.
It's got no license plates, no papers.
It was found up in the woods.
Probably been there a week now.
- No, no, no.
This couple I met yesterday, it's theirs.
- Well, then, your friends ain't got much respect for their own property, because in this territory, we call it an abandoned vehicle.
Now, excuse me, ma'am, I got a lot of work to do.
Move it on out.
- What was all that about?
- Remember that couple I told you I met yesterday?
They said they had a Chevy camper.
- Without license plates?
- Something's happened to them, I know it.
OK, look, you just hang out here, OK?
And warn me if anybody comes around.
- Marie!
Marie!
Sheriff.
Did you find anything?
- New York license plates.
That camper did belong to my friends.
I told Paula to see the doctor here.
Let's see if she did.
- Oh no.
No your couple came by here.
Perhaps they hitched a lift to Twin Forks Hospital.
- Thanks for your help, doctor.
- I'm sorry I couldn't do more.
- Doctor, about a year ago, you treated a nun.
Her name was Sister Ruth.
The sheriff said you might be able to give us some information about her?
- Yes.
Sister Ruth.
Terrible.
Terrible thing.
She was found wandering in the woods, near catatonic.
- In the woods?
Hm.
The sheriff said she was found at my place, at Wilderness Cottage.
- Now, as I recall, the sheriff found her in the woods.
- Janice was a very close friend of hers, and I was reading about her case-- me being a writer and everything.
- Oh, of course.
You're our visiting celebrity author.
Well, if I can be of any more help, don't hesitate to stop by.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Why did you mention Wilderness Cottage?
Is it because you saw Sister Ruth there?
- Yeah, somehow Ruth and the cottage are connected.
- Yeah, hello?
Hello, Tom?
Hi, it's Marie.
Tom, can you do me a favor?
I'm working on a real mystery here.
We'll talk about my health another time, OK?
Just listen to me.
You know that little friend of yours in the DA's office?
If I give you a New York license number, could you find out whether it belongs to a John Simmons or Paula Johnson?
- Sure.
- Did Sister Ruth say anything when you saw her in the hospital?
- I couldn't make any sense out of what she was saying.
I barely recognized her.
The only thing she said was-- well, it sounded like, we are all in fear.
I don't know what terrified her so.
But the devil must have touched her.
Because after that, she-- never became normal again.
- When you found her in the hospital, did they say whether or not they found her in the woods or in the cottage?
- That I can't remember.
- Marie things she might have been in the cottage she's renting.
- Well, that I don't know.
I remember she was suffering from an exposure in parts.
Maybe she was in the woods and sought refuge in your cottage.
- Father, there's no church in Drago.
Your parish here in Twin Forks must be the closest one.
Do any of them ever come here to your services?
- No.
- Isn't that unusual?
- It is strange.
But the people from Drago are a community unto themselves.
They have been for as long as I remember.
Well, I'm here if you need me.
God be with you.
- Are you gonna tell Richard what we're doing?
- What, are you kidding?
He thinks I'm on the edge already.
- Richard.
- Richard, they've killed them.
They've killed them.
I swear.
- Marie.
Marie!
Marie.
It was a dream, Marie.
A bad dream.
All right, let's do it like I said.
- OK.
- Squeeze it up right in your arm like that.
Look through the sight.
- Got it.
- Give it a shot.
Ah!
Damn.
- OK, now line it up with the thing right in your shoulder, and you look right through the sight--
- Hand of God, I guess.
I guess.
- I'd love to be able to live in a place like this.
How did you find it?
- I lucked out.
I ran into the developer that owns the place-- funny guy.
I guess it's been empty for about a year.
February, I think.
- Did he say who lived in it before?
- Some old couple.
Why?
What are you two up to?
- No reason.
Just curious.
Doesn't it seem like quite a coincidence?
I mean, Sister Ruth arrives at about the same time the couple leaves?
- I'm going to run into town.
We're low on supplies.
- Oh, you want me to come with you?
- No, no.
It's a one-man job.
- OK.
Bye.
- I might stop in the bar and grab a drink.
- OK.
- I shot at a wolf, Ri-
- Richard.
It was outside.
- Give me the gun.
I'm going to go look.
Give me the gun.
Stay here, OK?
Damn.
Son of a bitch.
- Did you see anything?
Janice, it's all coming apart.
I can't even believe what I see anymore.
- I believe you.
I checked back into the history of Drago.
The bell in that tower came from a village called Draga, a village in Romania.
Do you know why all the villagers died in that fire, the fire that burned down the bell tower?
People in a nearby community burned them alive.
They believed one of the villagers from Drago was a werewolf.
- A werewolf, Janice?
Oh, come on.
- It sounds crazy, but that's what they believed.
You know, the church still accepts the existence of the devil.
And werewolves, which are another form of the devil, have been recorded for centuries.
- Janice, I shot a wolf, OK?
Or something that looked like a wolf.
It wasn't some devil.
- But Marie-- but if there had been some form of werewolf, and if Sister Ruth saw--
- OK, just stop it, all right?
Just stop it right there.
Whatever caused Sister Ruth to lose it was real, all right?
Don't you get it?
It wasn't some mythical, mystical devil incarnate.
Janice, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I just-
- I don't know anything anymore.
- More questions about Sister Ruth?
- No.
No, it's about me.
I haven't been able to sleep very much, and I thought maybe you could refill my Valium prescription.
- That should be easy to fix.
- Doctor, I shot at a wolf last night.
- A wolf?
Marie, are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Well, I'm not exactly positive I shot at a wolf, but something tried to attack me last night.
- I've never heard of a wolf in these parts.
Perhaps it was a raccoon.
They're the most persistent scavengers around.
They can be pretty mean at night, easy to mistake.
- That had to be the biggest raccoon I've ever seen.
- Shadows do things.
If you haven't been sleeping, perhaps your mind just, well, probably over-reacted.
- I've been having some pretty wild dreams.
I even thought that the house was haunted by the people who used to live there.
I saw them.
It was like they were trying to warn me about something.
- Don't worry.
There's nothing in the forest or in your house to harm you.
Although I think I ought to warn you that your stairs have already claimed a victim.
The previous resident fell down them and damaged his hip.
- Is that why they left Drago?
- Mm-hmm.
He needed specialist treatment.
They went off to some famous Jewish hospital in New York.
Take one of those, a half hour before going to bed, huh?
- Thank you, Doctor.
I think I needed your advice as much as I needed these.
- Uh, hello.
- Tom, hi.
It's Marie.
Any luck with that license plate?
- Uh, yes, but it wasn't registered under, uh-- what were the names you gave me?
Johnson and Simmons.
It was registered under the name of Brooks.
- Tom, listen, let me ask you something serious now, OK?
Don't laugh.
Do you believe in werewolves?
- Yeah, only in the late show though.
- You're not being very serious.
- Well, I certainly hurt you're not.
Look, is this the real mystery you're working on?
- No, of course not.
I just asked because there's a legend about werewolves in this town.
- Ah, a werewolf story.
Well, maybe that is a good idea.
- Tom.
Tom, I am on vacation.
OK, Tom.
Thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
- We struck out.
The license plates weren't theirs.
I think it's time I talked to Richard.
- Are you sure that's what you want to do?
- Nope.
- How much more am I supposed to take?
You put together a few bad dreams and a frustrated lesbian, and you come up with howling werewolves and demented nuns.
Christ, you even involved Tom behind my back.
- Richard, I know that this sounds very strange--
- No, this doesn't sound strange, Marie.
It is strange.
You know, I blame myself for this.
I really do.
I blame myself for going down to LA and leaving you hear alone.
You were supposed to be resting, Marie.
You weren't supposed to be running around with Janice like a couple of Ghostbusters.
No wonder your dreams are getting worse.
- Richard, did you hear that?
- That's it, Marie.
That is it.
Tomorrow I'm taking you back to LA, and we're getting you to see a shrink.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out, Marie.
I need some air, all right?
Werewolves.
- Richard.
Richard.
Oh.
Come on.
It's gonna be all right, OK?
OK.
Here.
I'm going for the doctor.
- No.
No.
Don't go out there.
It's still out there.
Hide.
- He'll be OK.
A few scratches, bump on the head.
It's not a concussion.
- But his shoulder, the bite marks.
- Bite marks?
There weren't any bite marks.
Just a few scratches.
- Doctor, Richard was attacked by a wolf.
- He fell down a gully, Marie.
- Excuse me.
- Richard?
Your shoulder.
You said you were attacked by a wolf.
- A wolf, Marie?
I fell down a gully onto some rocks.
It's just a scratch.
- Last night, he told me that he was attacked by a wolf.
- He was probably a little delirious from the fall.
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Well, goodbye.
- Bye.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Father, do you have a book on exorcism?
- Exorcism, Janice?
- Yes.
The Roman rituals book.
- Sister Ruth asked me about that book.
- Did you lend it to her?
- No.
And it's not here.
Maybe she just took it.
- You don't think she was planning to do an exorcism.
- Oh, no.
No, she would know, as you know, only priests can perform exorcisms.
You know, I don't ever recall seeing that book again.
Oh, by the way, I have the bible Sister Ruth left at the church here.
- May I keep it, father?
- Don't see why not.
- Thank you.
It means a great deal to me.
- Richard, what are you doing?
- I'm going out.
- You should be resting in bed.
- It's OK, Marie.
I feel great.
- Look, Janice, this whole Sister Ruth thing,
I should never have said that I would help you.
I had a nervous breakdown in LA.
I couldn't tell what was real and what was dreams.
Last night, I even imagined that Richard was attacked by a wolf.
My doctor sent me here to rest, and instead,
I'm trying to solve some mystery that probably isn't.
- Are you saying that you-- you imagined everything that's happened?
- Dreams.
That's-- that's all they were.
It was nothing supernatural, no ESP-- they were just dreams.
That's it.
- And the vision of Sister Ruth?
- I don't know.
All I know is that Richard fell down a gully and banged himself up.
And I convinced myself that he was attacked by a wolf.
I even bandaged the bite on his shoulder.
It took both Richard and the doctor to convince me that there was no bite.
It was all in my mind.
Tom.
Hi, Tom.
Come on in.
Come on.
- Uh, Janice, this is Tom Billings.
- So you're Janice.
- Yeah.
- Did I interrupt something?
- No.
No, I-
- I better go.
I, uh-
- I have to get back to the hotel at Twin Forks.
Well, bye, Marie.
- Bye, Janice.
- Uh, is it something I said?
- No.
I said too much.
So, the real mystery was unreal, huh?
- Yep, I'm afraid so.
I got all confused, and I brought you up here for no reason.
I'm sorry.
- You son of a bitch.
Get out.
- Richard, Tom didn't mean anything by that.
- Get out.
- Tom.
- I came to talk to you about Marie.
- Come on in.
It was all my fault.
I-
- I was trying to find out what happened to my friend, Sister Ruth.
I got Marie involved and put all kinds of thoughts into her head.
- You mean that werewolf nonsense?
- That and many other things.
- But what about the license plates?
- It was all part of it.
- Yeah, she even got the names wrong.
The license plates belonged to somebody called Brooks.
- Brooks?
But that couldn't be.
That was Sister Ruth's last name.
Sister Ruth Brooks.
Well, then, that old couple that rented the cottage--
That is Sister Ruth's father.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
- That's why Sister Ruth came here-- to see her parents.
She lost contact with them when she became a nun.
She must have found out they were in Drago.
- Well, what about the license plates?
- Don't you see?
They never left town.
Everybody we talked to said they went back to New York.
- Well, why would they say that?
- Because they're trying to hide something.
Something happened to them, and Sister Ruth must have discovered it.
- And now you and Marie kept digging around here.
It sounds like Ruth's parents were murdered and probably the hitchhikers as well.
But I still don't understand why.
- The townspeople are trying to hide some secret.
Marie saw it in her visions.
She's in danger.
- Look, I'm gonna tell Marie and Richard to leave Drago tonight.
- I'm coming with you.
- Why should you think it's any different for you?
I'm going to drive you back to your hotel.
I want you to pack and leave today.
Come on.
- We are all in fear.
- What?
- Nothing, just something Sister Ruth said.
- It'll be good to get back to LA, won't it?
Guess I'm really just a city girl at heart.
I'll pack right after dinner, OK?
- I can't go yet.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
- Well, when, then?
- I don't know when.
Christ, Marie.
Will you stop hassling me?
- The devil's hatred for God has turned man into a habitation for demons.
Demons?
Werewolves.
We're in fear.
We're all in fear.
- We're all in fear.
- We're all in fear.
Werewolves.
- We're all in fear.
Demons.
- We're all in fear.
We're all in fear.
All in fear.
- We're all in fear.
Werewolves in here.
Werewolves in here.
Werewolves in here.
Werewolves?
- Werewolves in here.
Werewolves?
Werewolves?
Oh God!
- Oh!
Don't
- Richard?
Run, Marie.
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls.
Satan calls you.
Satan calls you.
Satan calls you.
Satan calls you.
- Come on.
Come on!
Get started!
Start, damn it.
Start!
Marie!
Marie!
- Werewolves.
- Ruth was trying to warn us.
- The tower.
Run!
Doctor!
- You were right, Janice.
We are werewolves.
- We must destroy them according to the legend.
The tower must be burnt with the werewolves inside.
You must set it on fire.
- What about you?
- I must ring the bell to summon the werewolves.
Go now.
Quick, before they get both of us.
Go!
God give me strength.
Richard?
Richard.
*
Well, what do you think?
*
Well, it couldn't be any worse than the last one.
Come on, let's give it a shot.
Hello.
Hi, we're here about the apartment
Advertised in The Voice.
Slaughter Realty.
How nice, I didn't think anyone would be responding
To our ad so soon, my name is Ruby.
I'm Lori and this is Alex.
Well, now, which one of you will be moving in?
I will, assuming that I decide to take the place.
Oh, I'm sure you will, it's a lovely apartment,
Just lovely, but don't take my word for it,
Go on up to the third floor and see for yourself.
Thanks, we will.
Who is it, Ruby?
This young man has come to see the apartment, Lizzy.
Is that so?
Tell him to go on up.
Yes, dear.
Hey, not bad.
At least this one's clean.
Yeah, but...
I don't like how sure they were that I'd take this place.
No roaches in the fridge this time.
Hey, one of the windows even opens.
The price is right.
And I'd be a little closer to you.
I'd say it was made to order.
We'll see.
Alex, man, I can't believe you're abandoning me like this.
I mean, what's a dump like this got to offer
That a dump like our dorm doesn't?
Peace, quiet, privacy.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
I cramp your style?
You got it.
Oh, so now you can study in peace and get into Lori's pants
Whenever you want.
You got it.
You slime, I should have known you were only doing this
To bag as many babes as possible.
And what babes am I supposed to bag?
The two old birds who run this place?
They're already swooning each other.
No, I'm sure there's somebody around here
To move in the, uh, right spot.
Nope.
This place is strictly retirement city.
*
You must be the new tenant.
Yes!
No.
I'm Alex Carmichael, your new neighbor.
This is just my friend.
Oh, gee, thanks for the swell intro, Al.
I'm Nicole.
This place could use another young face.
Yeah, so I noticed.
Do you ever go to any clubs?
Sometimes... a few.
Maybe I'll see ya around?
Yeah, maybe.
Just knock if you ever need anything,
My door's always open.
Thanks, I will.
Hey, uh, Alex?
Yeah?
You want a roommate?
No way.
Oh, come on, Al.
I'll pay ya 50 bucks to let me move in with ya,
We'll split everything right down the middle.
Forget it, Jer.
(Grunts)
My parents wanna meet you.
Well, tell them I wanna meet them too...
And then stall them for as long as possible.
I've already told them all about you.
What exactly did you tell them?
That you're sweet, and kind, and squeezably soft!
Oh, you didn't.
I did.
Oh, Alex, I love what I see.
So do I.
We don't have time for that.
We never do.
That's not true.
I've got something for you.
Keys to my kingdom.
Consider it an open invitation.
I'll think about it.
You said that once I got my own place...?
I know what I said, but I need more time.
Let me handle this in my own way.
Please?
All right.
Whoops!
Excuse me.
No problem.
You must be Alex, uh, Nikki told me about you.
I'm Roman.
This is my girlfriend, Lori.
How's it hanging, Lori?
Fine, I guess.
So, what's your angle, Alex?
I paint.
Oh, no kidding.
I'm into poetry.
Have you had anything published?
No, are you kidding?
Nobody takes an artist's work seriously anymore,
Until he's been planted six feet under,
If you know what I mean.
So, I'm composing a piece that won't be finished
Until I am.
I add a new line every year.
Wow, that's really fascinating.
Well, I don't wanna be rude, but, uh, we're in a hurry.
Hey, no problem, man.
I'll catch you later.
Yeah.
Take it easy, Lori.
*
Hi, Alex.
Hi!
Is that your girlfriend I saw you with earlier?
Probably.
She looks like a nice girl.
She is.
Too bad.
(Moaning)
*
(Moaning continues)
*
(Screaming)
Roman?
Oh, hi, Alex.
What are you doing?
Just looking for some things for my apartment.
In the garbage?
Sure, you never know what you find until you look.
I guess not.
Hey, Alex.
How about coming over for some nourishment?
I know they haven't turned on your gas yet.
Uh, sure, I guess.
Great, how about tonight?
Well, uh, I have to work.
No problem, I'll fix something that won't spoil.
Catch ya later.
So anyways, she starts...
She starts making this big deal
About how I blow my nose, she's saying... she's saying,
"You blow it too hard, Jerry!"
You blow too hard, you blow that hard,
"You're gonna pop your eardrums and everything like that."
I said, "No way, I'm not gonna blow... blow my eardrums."
I gotta blow my nose hard before anything can come out, right?"
Right.
So, I told her that and she says... she says,
"No, no, you're gonna hurt yourself,
You're gonna hurt yourself."
Then she gets right down to the real heart of the matter.
I knew there was something else.
She says, "It's too loud, Jerry, it's too loud."
I said, "Oh, that's it, huh?"
Well, I'm gonna blow my nose any way I damn well please
"And if you don't like it, you can just..."
Hey, are you listening to me or what?
What?
What am I, talking to a zombie, here?
Only if Nicole practices voodoo as well as she does fellatio.
Has the floor whore been keeping you awake at night
With shuttering cries of exaltation?
Bloodcurdling screams is more like it.
Ooh, she does not sound like
Any of the girls next door I ever knew.
And her cleaning habits are as strange
As her mating habits, you know what time she chose
To take out the garbage last night?
Relax, Alex, relax.
Lori's gonna come around sooner or later
And your own bed's gonna go bump in the night.
Don't expect me to dream when I can't even sleep.
Sorry I'm late.
Never mind, "sorry," I thought you lived a couple blocks away
So you were never gonna be late?
Well, I meant I'd never be late getting home.
Okay, do me a favor, don't forget to lock up, all right?
Don't worry, don't worry.
Why should I worry?
'Cause you'd rather watch dirty movies
Than take care of the customers?
Let your mother worry.
Hi, Horace.
(Inaudible grumbling)
What's wrong with him?
Oh, he doesn't like leaving his livelihood
In the hands of a gentile.
I was just passing by and thought I'd say... hi.
Well, how about passing by my place a little later on tonight?
I can't, I have to study for that exam in Theory tomorrow.
So do you.
So, we'll study together.
A lot we'd accomplish.
At least we'd enjoy failing.
Sorry, babe.
Try to drop me a postcard when you got some time, okay?
Stop.
I gotta go, I'll see ya in class, okay?
Yeah.
*
I guess I should have warned you that I don't eat meat.
No, really, that's okay.
My mind is open to new experiences.
Glad to hear it.
We could use some fresh blood around here.
What is this stuff, anyway?
Himalayan yogurt, courtesy of Lizzy.
Funny, she doesn't strike me as the Himalayan yogurt type.
Hey, not bad, not bad!
Why's yours blue?
Because blue's my color.
*
Liquor, brewed before Lizzy was born.
Well, at least it's well-aged.
What's in it?
Nobody knows.
Lizzy's old man was into alchemy.
*
(Coughing)
Certainly is potent.
I gave up acid after Lizzy gave me
My first bottle of this stuff.
To Lizzy's father, wherever he is.
I hear that.
*
Looking for these?
You left them in your door.
Thanks.
Come on in.
I shouldn't be here.
I turn you on, don't I?
God, yes.
*
Oh, Alex.
*
Oh, Alex...
*
Zach...
Zachary...
Zachary!
*
Spare some change?
No!
Hey, you didn't let me finish!
I don't care.
I gotta eat too, you know?
Get away from me!
Hey, come on, buddy, what's a quarter to you?
I don't believe this!
Hey, don't be so stingy, fella.
If things was reversed, I'd give you a quarter.
Hell, I might even give you two!
Huh?
(Phone ringing)
*
God, oh God, what is happening to me?
Hey!
Go somewhere else if you're going to do that.
Show a little respect, huh?
This is my home.
Hey, mister, you don't look so good.
Uh, may... maybe you should see a doctor or something?
Hey, please, mister!
You want your quarters back?
*
(Screaming)
*
(Screaming)
Stop!
(Screaming)
*
*
(Knocking at door)
Who is it?
Roman.
I thought I heard you come in.
Your flat is right underneath mine, you know?
Here, I brought you some leftovers from last night.
Look, I appreciate the thought, but I haven't been able
To keep any food down all day.
Hung-over, eh?
I told you that stuff would mess you up.
Listen, has that wine ever made you hallucinate
Or do anything strange?
Sure, all the time.
That's what's so great about it.
And were you serious when you said
Lizzy's father was an alchemist?
You bet, he was into that whole occult scene.
And what happened to him?
Suicide.
He killed himself in the cellar and took his followers with him.
You know an awful lot about the history of this building.
Listening to Lizzy's crazy stories
Is the price you have to pay...
If you want your share of the old man's wine.
(Phone ringing)
Ah, excuse me.
It's no problem, man.
All right... take care.
Let me know if you need anything.
I will.
Hello?
Alex, where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you all day.
I'm sick, I turned the ringer off.
What's wrong?
I'm just not myself today.
You missed the exam today.
I know, I'll have to make it up.
Will you be yourself tomorrow?
I hope so.
Will you come to dinner?
My parents are really getting on my case about meeting you.
I don't know, Lori.
Please?
For me?
All right, but I better get a good meal out of this.
You will, I promise.
We eat at seven, so don't be late, okay?
I won't.
I love you!
*
Nicole?
*
How do you think I'd look in this?
Outstanding.
Oh, I don't think so.
You know, you really shouldn't be so afraid
To try something new once in a while.
Jerry loves it when I experiment.
I don't need gimmicks to attract Alex.
Maybe not, but I'll bet he takes a lot of cold showers.
I don't want to discuss it, okay?
Fine, don't say I didn't warn you when Alex jumps
Into the bed of a woman who knows how to defrost.
Better get going.
I've got a lot to do if I want tonight to be a rousing success.
Okay, see ya tomorrow!
Hey, Lori!
Good luck!
*
Oh, excuse me!
You're in trouble.
Terrible trouble.
Let go of my arm!
I can tell.
No, wait, not you, somebody else.
Somebody very close to you, perhaps?
Your lover?
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you... for a dollar.
I don't think so.
Come to my parlor and we'll talk.
A dollar's a small price to pay... for a soul.
Watch your step, dear.
Your eyes probably aren't as good in the dark as mine are.
This is it, the legacy of Zachary Devin.
*
Is this all there is?
It's all that's left.
There used to be more, but the other tenants drank it.
I suppose you'll be wanting some too?
*
Yes.
I thought so.
Nobody can resist Zachary's recipe.
*
Ruby, what did Zachary look like?
Wait a minute, I'll show you.
Now let me see...
Here it is.
*
This is Zachary's book.
You can still get it in some occult bookstores.
*
He poured his soul into this book
And into these bottles.
*
Lori tells me you've done absolutely wonderful things
With your new apartment, Alex.
It's habitable, I suppose.
Don't believe him, it's charming.
Have you been scouting any agencies yet?
I don't wanna work for an agency.
As soon as your commercialized art becomes a product
Instead of a statement.
Yeah, well there's nothing wrong with being commercial.
I mean especially when so many young artists
In this city are starving.
Before this goes any further, I have an announcement to make.
I've decided to move in with Alex.
We're gonna live together.
Well...
I don't know what to say.
Yeah, well I do, forget it!
Daddy, I'm 22 years old!
And you can't stop me from doing this,
So you might as well just accept it and be happy for me
Instead of causing a lot of unnecessary grief.
This is rather sudden, dear.
I know it must seem like that, but we've been seeing each other
Almost a year now and we think we're ready for this.
Actually, Lori, maybe you should stay here a little longer.
What?
Now, things are happening kind of fast right now.
The timing is bad.
Let me get this straight, you've been begging me
To move in with you ever since you got this apartment
And now that I'm finally ready, you change your mind?
I just need some time to myself right now.
I don't believe this!
*
Excuse me.
I don't understand any of this.
We made plans.
Alex seems to have made other plans.
Hey, nice pad.
Listen, uh...
I don't mind undressing you,
If that's what you're into.
But if I do, I'm gonna start with that silly bandage.
I like to see who I'm taking care of.
I'm sure I've seen worse.
*
Okay, it's your money.
*
Okay, remember now, nothing too kinky.
*
I wouldn't want to bear scars for the rest of my life,
You know what I mean?
*
I'm only doing this till I graduate.
Hey, now that wasn't so bad, was it?
Now, let's just shine a little light on the subject.
*
You crazy bastard.
*
(Door opening)
How many people have you killed?
I stopped counting long ago.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Well, what's your name?
Nicole.
No.
Who are you really?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, then who's this?
Gimme that.
Not until you tell me what I wanna know.
All right, my name's Lisa Holt.
Satisfied?
No.
Who was she?
Previous possessor of this body.
What happened to her?
She went away.
Why?
Because there's only room enough for one of us
And my time had come.
You're one of the people who committed suicide
In the cellar, aren't you?
Yes.
Why did you kill yourself?
Because Zachary demanded it.
And when will Zachary's time come?
When you've gone away.
God almighty.
It's not so bad, Alex.
You could come back sometime.
Sure, when Zachary's done using my body
To turn the local bums and prostitutes into raw meat!
The slime must be appeased and their lives are worthless.
You knew about this the whole time, didn't you?
You seduced me, so that it would happen!
Your mind had to be opened up to corruption
In order for the elixir to work.
You whore!
You wanted me, Alex.
Just like you wanted the elixir you stole from my refrigerator.
I use my gifts for Zachary.
Use them on somebody else from now on.
Alex, wait!
Why, so that a Satanist who's been dead for 30 years
Can take over my body while I fuck you?
No thanks.
*
The dollar that I charge is not for the service I offer,
But to show that you have faith in my abilities.
Now, show me your faith.
Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you.
Now, don't be afraid.
I want you to open your mind up to me,
To give me those thoughts which I cannot take on my own.
I must determine the nature of your astral interior
Before I can define the terrible aura that surrounds you.
How are you going to do that?
Give me your hand.
That's it.
Now, try to relax.
You're still a virgin.
This has caused considerable anxiety between you
And your suitor, uh, what is his name?
Alex.
I see... a structure blocking the light.
Does Alex live in an old building?
*
Yes.
*
This is not good.
What is it?
*
I see serpents, young and old, who are not what they seem.
*
They would draw Alex into their vile nest.
Who are they?
The watch dogs of evil.
Stop.
I see naked bodies engaged in unspeakable acts.
Stop it, that's enough.
I see in Alex the resurrection of a terrible man.
You're frightening me!
Your fear is well founded.
Alex is beyond salvation.
His corruption is absolute, like a malignancy.
What kind of corruption?
Alex is involved with the dead.
Shades are a nice touch, Alex.
Your eyes bothering you?
Leave me alone.
What's with you?
You're walkin' around with a chip on your shoulder
That would cripple most people.
None of your business.
What's your hurry, Alex?
Out to meet your dealer?
Or are you handling them and the business, too, these days?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, no?
I know that people don't change over night
Unless they're doing some serious shit.
I'm not on drugs.
I don't believe you.
I don't care what you believe, get lost.
No, I won't...
Don't touch me!
It's those neighbors of yours, isn't it?
Alex?
*
*
Oh, Alex.
You startled me.
What are you doing?
I was worried about you.
So, you snuck into my apartment,
Went through my things.
Well, yes, but...
Bitch!
Alex.
You've got no business spying on me.
That isn't fair.
I was concerned about...
Just like Jerry was concerned.
I bet the two of you are in on this together.
Jerry has nothing to do with this.
Don't lie to me!
Let go of me!
It was a mistake to give you my keys.
I want them back.
Guess you better take this back, too.
Lori, wait.
(Door slamming)
(Creaking)
What are you doing down here?
Well, what brings you crawling out of that hole
You call an apartment, Lizzy?
I sometimes come down here for instruction.
I suppose you hear voices in your head.
Something like that.
You're the only one in this building who really is
Who you're supposed to be, aren't you?
Yup.
And Nicole and Roman and Ruby,
And everyone else who lives here
Was somebody else when they first moved in.
That's right.
First you fed them this...
This muck.
It is called ectoplasm.
And then you gave them some of your father's elixir.
And they took on the personalities
Of his followers.
You got it, kid.
Yeah, now you want me to give up my life so he can
Have his back?
I knew I'd made the right choice getting you
For the apartment.
It's been vacant for years,
Just waiting for the right occupant.
Tell me, what were the others like before they joined
Your father's coven?
They were the scum of the Earth.
Roman was a bum.
Ruby was a bag lady.
Nicole was a hooker.
My father took them in.
He fed them and gave them clothes.
He taught them to control their flesh.
He gave them a reason to live.
(Laughing)
And a reason to die.
And the people whose bodies they possessed?
Roman's host fancied himself a poet.
Poor Roman.
He's so confused.
He sometimes forgets who he is.
Nicole's host was an actress.
She was the easiest of all.
Why did your father and his followers kill themselves?
It was an experiment.
They conquered all that life had to offer,
So they sought to conquer death.
I wanted to kill myself, too.
But someone had to stay behind and administer the elixir.
My mother did it till she died.
And then I took over.
Our work is nearly finished now.
That's what you think, you old witch.
You can't resist the elixir.
Well, watch me!
Go ahead, run!
Your time is almost up.
(Laughing)
*
Alex, my man!
*
Alex Carmichael?
Who wants to know?
Detective O'Bannon, NYPD.
I'm gonna take up a few minutes of your time
With some questions.
About what?
I'm checking the disappearance of a prostitute
Named Heather Langley.
Never seen her before.
Take another look.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
I think you can.
How so?
I think you were about the last person to see Ms. Langley alive.
I just told you, I've never seen her before.
You know, we got a problem.
One of her associates...
Associates, saw her enter this building
With a man that fits your description.
His face was bandaged.
If his face was bandaged, how do I fit the description?
He was the same height.
Same jacket.
Same ugly building.
Every college student in the neighborhood
Has a jacket like this.
And every building on this block looks the same.
You know, kid, if every building on this block looks like that,
We're livin' in the Dark Ages.
What's the big deal about one missing whore?
Probably just skipped out on a pimp.
I think not.
See, Ms. Langley and I were friends.
If she was leaving town, she would've mentioned it.
You know how close you get
When you live in the same building.
Yeah, sure you do.
So finding this particular missing whore,
To me, it's more than just a professional interest.
Sure.
Well, you can reach me at this number.
Yeah, I'll call ya if I find out anything.
You do that.
Hey, kid, drink some water.
A kid like you shouldn't sweat so much.
(Knocking)
Alex?
(Knocking)
Alex, I know you're in there.
*
(Door bell ringing)
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Tracy.
I have the tapes your mother ordered.
Super.
Is she home?
No.
But I think she left you a tip.
Come on in.
Want a drink?
No, thanks.
You're no fun.
Wait right here.
*
Alex?
*
Check that out.
What's your hurry, homeboy?
Sorry.
Ain't no thing.
Come on.
Let's go.
*
All right, Mr. Invisible Man.
Up the dollars, or else.
I don't have any money.
I said, up the dollars, man.
Look, I'm sick, so why don't you just leave me alone?
Don't make me break you up, homeboy.
Get out of my head!
Yo, Seaman, homeboy's sick.
No, he's just tryin' to be slick.
Come on, freak.
I need some money.
So, get a job.
White ass little faggot.
I'm gonna fuck your ass up!
Shit!
Mother fucker, let go of my arm.
Word.
(Biting)
(Screaming)
Yo, let's get the fuck out of here.
(Screaming)
Come back!
Come back!
Come back!
*
Yuck.
And I thought my zits were bad.
What the hell are you doing here?
Believe it or not, I was worried.
So, you snuck in.
No, ixnay on the paranoia, pally.
Your landlady let me up.
You prick.
Oh, no need to apologize for that one, Alex.
I realize that you're sick.
So, what've you got?
VD?
Herpes?
Leprosy?
None of your goddamn business.
Oh, I guess we can rule out social disease.
Shut up!
You need help, Alex.
Get out of here before I forget you're my friend.
My God, will you look at what's happening to you?
I like what's happening to me!
*
(Screaming)
*
*
*
Hi, Alex.
Hi.
I'm sorry about the other day.
I shouldn't have sneaked in like that.
And I shouldn't have overreacted the way I did.
Can we see each other tonight?
I'd like that.
At your place?
Sure.
Have you heard about Jerry?
No, what happened?
He's been missing since last Friday.
Well, he probably just needed to get away for a few days.
He'll show up tomorrow with a hangover, you'll see.
I hope so.
Poor Rene's a wreck.
I don't know what I'd do if you disappeared like that.
Listen, I gotta get goin', okay?
See ya.
Ms. Swan?
Yes?
Irish O'Bannon, NYPD.
I'd like to ask you some questions about Jerry Hunter.
Oh, yeah, what would you like to know?
When was the last time you saw him?
In class last Friday.
Aren't you involved with Alexander Carmichael?
What's Alex got to do with this?
He figures rather prominently in another missing persons case
I'm working on.
What other case?
Case of a prostitute that... disappeared
Last Wednesday night.
Your boyfriend might've been her last customer.
Alex had dinner with my parents and I last Wednesday.
I already spoke with your parents.
They said he left your house at 8:15.
That left him plenty of time to kill.
You're wrong.
Alex would never go to a prostitute.
And I'm sure he had nothing to do
With Jerry's disappearance.
She's so...
Wholesome-looking.
Some guys like that.
Do you?
Sometimes.
I still don't understand why you're going through
With all of this.
You probably never will.
That part of your life is over now.
You have me.
She could ruin everything.
She won't.
Why take a chance?
Because I have to.
(Knocking)
*
*
Not in here.
You know, it's just like a woman to lie on her ass
While the man does all the work.
*
That feels so good.
Careful.
Alex, you're hurting me.
No.
I'm killing you.
Just like I killed Jerry.
That isn't funny.
You're right.
I shouldn't joke about such things.
But it was necessary.
What are you talking about?
I had to kill him, or the slime
Would've consumed me.
And I enjoyed it.
And if I enjoyed killing my best friend,
I should love killing you.
Alex, what's happening to you?
I'm starting over, honey.
Alex?
*
Alex!
*
Alex!
*
Stop!
*
(Screaming)
*
You did this to me.
Get away from me, Alex.
It's all your fault.
I mean it!
You turned me into what I am, you little cock tease.
Stay back, Alex.
Stop calling me Alex!
I am Zachary.
Whoever you are, stay back please!
*
Little girls shouldn't play with knives.
*
Stop it, Lori.
Stop the pain.
I can't.
Do it, for God's sake.
*
Here's to our big apartment.
(Screaming)
No!
Tag, you're it!
*
Time to die, time to die.
*
Kill her, kill her!
*
Don't just sit there.
Get up, get up and kill her!
*
What are you doing?
*
No, wait, stay back!
Don't do it, please don't do it!
I love you, Lori, you know that.
I painted your portrait.
I'll do anything you ask.
Please, don't.
Shut up!
*
Die, goddamn it!
*
He didn't leave a forwarding address?
He didn't leave anything, including the rent.
I thought that kid was sort of strange.
And he seemed like such a nice young man
When he first moved in.
Maybe his girlfriend knows where he is.
If she does, she's not talking.
The poor kid's devastated.
You know, I couldn't help but notice
Just how nice that upstairs apartment is.
Will it be available soon?
Are you interested, Detective O'Bannon?
Call me Irish.
The neighborhood will be so much safer
With a police officer living in the building.
Why don't you stop in again after we've cleaned up?
You know how messy these young people are.
Thanks, I will.
We didn't even have to run an ad this time.
(Laughing)
*
*
That's a huge male.
Bet he's more than 1500 pounds.
Hey look!
An Hour...
Hour and a half.
Good.
We're downwind now.
Why'd you shoot?
I was in a good position.
Well you should have waited for me son.
A damned shame.
You got him in the left shoulder.
He spun around on his forlegs from right to left.
If you'd had hit him in the hindlegs, he'd never gotten up again.
A bear always turns into his wounds.
You spooked him son.
My gun jammed.
You're not even close to seeing him again.
Not even with them glasses.
Take it from me.
Give up!
He's miles away by now.
What's that?
Easy girl.
Come on.
Hold it!
I swear it.
I'll kill you.
Don't worry.
With a little luck I'll be back before your foot is mended.
Wait 'till you see them dogs!
We'll have us some fun.
Dixie
Come on Dixie Belle.
Come on you curlyhaired girl.
Come on beautiful.
Good dog.
Hoppin' around.
Hop with me.
Did you miss me Dixie?
Over here!
Get up there, come on.
There he is.
Here grab on.
He's out of range.
Don't shoot.
You'll hit the dogs!
Gotcha.
You wanna bite me huh?
You're a naughty little fella.
Who's that up there?
Horse.
Men...stupid men.
I'm Tom.
You hear that?
The dogs have made it back.
Come on my babies.
Come here.
Look what he's done to you.
Damn
Back here, get back here.
Here Kamic.
Here.
Take it easy.
Lie down!
Stop it!
Look...(Darn cubby chewed through the rope)
Forget him.
Let's move on.
Wait.
What's that?
Good huh?
Come on...you hungry?
You wanna stand up?
It's down here now...
No it's up here.
Stand up.
He likes it.
You do want it don't you?
Where did it go?
Stop fooling around.
We've got things to do.
You'll see Tom.
This is just the place to box him in.
You told Joseph to keep the dogs muzzled didn't you?
He's waiting by the creek.
Here we are.
You pick a spot up there.
I'll take the other side.
Sooner or later he's gotta come through here.
You stay put.
Don't worry.
I won't move.
Please don't kill me.
Go, go away.
Hurry.
Get out of sight.
Hide.
I got him.
He fell like a stone there...clear over the edge.
Okay little fella.
You're free to go now.
So long.
How long have we known each other?
Three months?
Five
I don't like to ask folks questions.
Everyone has their secrets.
By God that's the way it should be.
Look who's taken a shine to civilization.
Good luck little fella.
Whoa.
That's a huge male.
Bet he's more than 1,500 pounds.
Good.
We're downwind now.
- Why'd you shoot?
- I was in a good position.
You should have waited for me, son.
Crying shame.
Damnation!
Got him in the left shoulder.
He spun around on his forelegs from right to left.
If you'd have hit him in the hind legs, he'd have never got up again.
A bear always turns into his wound.
You spooked him, son.
My gun Jammed!
You're not even close to seeing him again.
Not even with them glasses.
Take it from me.
Give up.
He's miles away by now.
Believe me.
What's that?
Easy, girl.
Come on.
Whoa, boy.
Hold it!
I swear it, I'll kill you!
Don't worry.
With a little luck, I'll be back before your foot's mended.
Wait till you see them dogs.
We'll have us some fun.
Dixie!
Come on, Dixie Belle!
Come on, you curly-headed girl.
Come on, beautiful.
That's a good dog.
There she is.
That's a nice one!
Hop it around with me, baby.
Did you miss me?
All right.
Over here!
Get up there.
Come on.
There he is!
Here, grab on.
He's out of range!
Don't shoot!
You'll hit the dogs!
I got you!
You want to bite me?
Come on.
There you go.
You're a naughty little fellow, ain't you?
Whoa.
Who's that up there?
Gonna take a bite of that?
Big, huh?
Horse.
Yeah, that's it.
Man.
Stupid man.
I'm Tom.
You hear that?
Dogs made it back.
Come on, my babies!
Come here!
Kwimi, Dako, Mongo!
Hold still.
Damn bear chewed the hell out of these dogs.
Look what he's done to you.
Damnation!
It's okay.
You'll be okay, boy.
Here, hold on to them.
I'll take care of you.
Easy.
Whoa!
Get back here!
- Get them back.
- Here, Kamic.
Come on with me.
Come on back.
- That will do.
- Take it easy.
Attaboy.
Quiet!
Lie down!
Stop it!
Look.
Forget him.
Let's move on.
Wait.
What's that?
Good, huh?
Is that good?
Come on.
You hungry?
All right, come on.
Come on this way.
Now, up.
You want to stand up?
It's down here now.
No, it's up here.
Stand up for it.
Look at him go.
He likes it.
You want it back?
You do want it.
Yeah.
Where did it go?
Is it over there?
There it is.
Stand up.
You want more?
You ain't getting no more, greedy beggar.
Stop fooling around.
We got things to do.
You'll see.
This is just the place to box him in.
Did you tell Joseph to keep the dogs muzzled?
Yeah, he knows.
He's waiting by the creek.
Here we are.
You pick a spot up there.
I'll take the other side.
Sooner or later, he has to come through here.

He fell like a stone there, clear over the edge.
Okay, little fellow.
You're free to go now.
So long.

He's miles away by now.
Believe me.
Easy go.
Easy.
Hoh hoh--easy go, easy, easy.
I swear it, I'll kill you!
With a little luck, I'll be back before your foot's mended.
Will you see them dogs?

Come on!
Come on!
Come on, you furry pretty girl.
Come on.
Over here!
There he is.
He's out of range!
Don't shoot!
You'll hit the dogs!
Gotcha!
Come on, little fella.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Who's there, huh?
Big, huh?

It's a 'horse'.
Man!
Stupid, man!
Who are my babies?
Go go go!
Come here!
Hold on.
Easy.
Go.
Here coming, here!
Come on.
Get easy.
Attaboy.
Quiet!
Lie down!
Stop it!
Now!
Lie down!
Hey, look.
Ah, forget him.
Let's move on.
Ohh... that's so nice, huh ?
Come on.
Come on.
Are you hungry?
Come on.
Stand up.
Go to top here.
Come on.
Stand up, boy.
He liked it.
Yum yum yum yum yum yum.
You like it, huh?
You do want more, yeah.
You'll see, Tom.
This is just the place to box him in.
Did Joseph keep the dogs muzzled?
- Yes, he's waiting by the river.
Here we are.
You pick a spot up there.
I'll take the other side.
Sooner or later, he's got to come through here.
You stay put.
All right.
Don't worry.
I won't move.
Damn.
Please, please don't!
Go!
Go away!
Hide!
I got him!
I got him!
He fell like a stone there, clear over the edge.
- Huh?
OK, little fella...
You're free to go.
How long have we known each other, son?
Three months?
Five.
Five.
You see...
I don't like to ask folks questions.
Everyone has a secret inside.
By God, that's the way it should be.
Hey, looks who's talking a shine of civilization!
Heya!
Heya!
Good luck, little fella!

That's a huge male.
He is more than 1,500 pounds.
Hey, look.
An hour, hour-and-a-half.
We are downwind now.
Why did you shoot ?
- I was in a good position.
You should have waited for me, son.
- Damn!
- You got him in the left shoulder.
He spun around on his forelegs, from right to left.
If you'd hit him in hind legs, he'd never got up again.
A bear always turns in to his wound.
You spooked him, son.
You spooked him.
- My gun jammed!
You're not even close to see him again.
Not even with them glasses.
Take it from me:
Give up!
He's miles away by now.
Believe me.
Easy go.
Easy.
Hoh hoh--easy go, easy, easy.
I swear it, I'll kill you!
With a little luck, I'll be back before your foot's mended.
Will you see them dogs?
- We'll having' some fun.
Dixie!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, you furry pretty girl.
Come on.
Over here!
There he is.
He's out of range!
Don't shoot!
You'll hit the dogs!
Gotcha!
Come on, little fella.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Who's there, huh?
Big, huh?
!
It's a 'horse'.
Man!
Stupid, man!
Who are my babies?
Go go go!
Come here!
Hold on.
Easy.
Go.
Here coming, here!
Come on.
Get easy.
Attaboy.
Quiet!
Lie down!
Stop it!
Now!
Lie down!
Hey, look.
Ah, forget him.
Let's move on.
Ohh... that's so nice, huh ?
Come on.
Come on.
Are you hungry?
Come on.
Stand up.
Go to top here.
Come on.
Stand up, boy.
He liked it.
Yum yum yum yum yum yum.
You like it, huh?
You do want more, yeah.
You'll see, Tom.
This is just the place to box him in.
Did Joseph keep the dogs muzzled?
- Yes, he's waiting by the river.
Here we are.
You pick a spot up there.
I'll take the other side.
Sooner or later, he's got to come through here.
You stay put.
All right.
Don't worry.
I won't move.
Damn.
Please, please don't!
Go!
Go away!
Hide!
I got him!
I got him!
He fell like a stone there, clear over the edge.
- Huh?
OK, little fella...
You're free to go.
How long have we known each other, son?
Three months?
Five.
Five.
You see...
I don't like to ask folks questions.
Everyone has a secret inside.
By God, that's the way it should be.
Hey, looks who's talking a shine of civilization!
Heya!
Heya!
Good luck, little fella!

A giant male.
He weighs at least 750 kilo.
Look.
An hour, hour-and-a-half.
We are below wind now.
Why did you shoot ?
- It had to be quick.
Should have waited for me.
His left shoulder is hit.
He was spinning on his front-legs.
A wounded bear retreats.
If you would have hit at least a back-leg ...
We can forget it.
Nah.
Won't see him anymore.
Even with your binoculars.
Forget it, man.
He is long gone.
Believe me.
Easy now.
Easy.
Come up.
I will get you.
When I'm lucky, I'm back before your foot heals.
With the dogs there the fun really starts.
Dixie ?
Come here.
Come, beautiful dog.
Come here.
Whos dog are you ?
Here.
There he is.
No, too far away.
You will hit the dogs.
Gotcha.
He does not like it.
What a bad little bear.
What is that ?
Big, hé ?
It's a 'horse'.
Tom.
This way.
Come, dogs.
Easy.
Hush.
Stay.
Come here.
Now be quiet.
Hush.
Hush.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Hé, look at that.
Forget him.
Let's go on.
Nice, hé ?
Get up.
It's time.
No, first stand up.
Sit up.
Look at him.
Nice, hé ?
Sit up.
And stand en sit up.
That's a nice place to lock him up.
Did Joseph muzzle the dogs ?
- Yes, he's waiting by the river.
We're here.
You take position there, I'll take the other side.
He has to pass here.
But stay on your spot.
Sure thing.
I won't move a muscle.
Damn.
Please, let me live.
Please.
Get away.
Go.
They can't see you.
Bulls-eye, he fell like a rock in the ravine.
Ok, boy ...
You are free.
How long have we known, son ?
Three months ?
Five.
I never ask people questions.
Everybody has his secrets.
Supposed to be like that.
He found the taste for the real world.
Get away.
Good luck.

That's a nice one!
Hop it around with me, baby.
Did you miss me, Dixie baby?
All right.
Over here!
Get up, Come on.
There. there he is!
Here, grab on.
He's out of range!
Don't shoot!
You'll hit the dogs!

You're a naughty little fellow, ain't you?
Whoa.
Who's that up there, huh?
Gonna take a bite of that?
Big, huh?
Horse.
Yeah, that's it.
Man.
Stupid man.
I'm Tom.
You hear that?
Dogs made it back.
Come on, my babies!
Come here!
Kwimi, Dako, Mongo!
Hold still.
Damn bear chewed the hell out of these dogs.
Look what he's done to you.
Damnation!
It's okay.
You'll be okay, boy.
Here, hold on to them.
I'll take care of you.
Easy.
Whoa!
Get back here!
- Get them back.
- Here, Kamic.
Come on with me.
Come on back.
- That will do.
- Take it easy.
Attaboy.
Quiet!
Lie down!

Good, huh?
Is that good?
Good, Come on.

It's down here now.
No, it's up here.
Stand up for it.
Look at him go.
He likes it.
You want it back?
You do want it.
Yeah.
Where did it go?
Is it over there?
There it is.
Stand up.
You want more?
You ain't getting no more, greedy beggar.
Stop fooling around.
We got things to do.
You'll see, Tom This is just the place to box him in.
You did you tell Joseph to keep the dogs muzzled, did ya?
Yeah, he knows.
He's waiting by the creek.
Here we are.
You pick a spot up there.
I'll take the other side.
Sooner or later, he has to come through here.
You stay put.
- All right, don't worry.
- Yeah.
I won't move.
Damn.

Go!
Go away!
Hurry.

# From Mayfair to Park Lane You will hear this same refrain
# In every house again, again #
You rang, m'lord?
# Stepping out on the town The social whirl goes round and round
# The rich are up, the poor are down #
You rang, m'lord?
# The Bunny Hug at the Shim Sham club The Charleston at The Ritz
#And at the Troc do the Turkey Trot They give Aunt Maude a thousand fits
# Saucy flappers in cloche hats Natty chappies in white spats
# The upper set is going bats #
You rang, m'lord?
Henry, the kedgeree is ready.
-Stand by to pull it up.
-Yes, Mrs Lipton.
-Kedgeree coming up, James.
-Standing by, Mrs Lipton.
Away you go, Henry.
Going away, Mrs Lipton.
Here's Lady Lavender's tea tray.
She's coming down for breakfast.
Now don't forget, Ivy, it's vacuum cleaner day today.
The Goblin man will be here in a minute.
I hate Goblin day.
Well, it's not right with a big house like this.
I can't do it in three hours.
They should hire it for a whole day.
Well, Lord Meldrum says that money doesn't grow on trees.
Well, it does in his case.
He's got a rubber plantation.
(Knocking on door)
Oh, that'll be the Goblin man now.
-Shall I answer it, Mrs Lipton?
-No, Henry, Ivy will answer the door.
Morning.
Goblin man.
Which heads do you want?
Carpets, upholstery or curtains?
I can't do the upholstery and the curtains in three hours.
-Just the carpets.
-There you are, then.
With the carpet head, the hire charge will be two and a threepence.
Mr Stokes will pay you when you come back to collect it.
Well, don't work too hard.
-Here, when's your day off?
-Sorry, I'm not allowed followers.
Oh!
Oh, Henry, come and give us a hand!
Coming, Ivy.
You take the body, I'll take the snake.
That Goblin man tried to get off with me.
Take no notice, Ivy.
He's always making suggestive remarks.
He never makes suggestive remarks to me.
Don't worry, Mabel, he will one day.
If His Lordship bought a Goblin, we shouldn't have to have him round here.
Talk sense, Mabel.
A new Goblin costs seven guineas.
Now, don't you leave it standing idle.
Henry, you go upstairs and help Ivy in the drawing room whilst they're having their breakfast.
When they finish their breakfast, you can do the dining room.
Then the landing whilst they're in the bedrooms, and you can do the bedrooms as soon as you can.
-Yes, Mrs Lipton.
-Yes, Mrs Lipton.
Ivy.
Ivy.
(Vacuum stops)
Oh, thank heavens.
It was going right through my head.
Ivy, did you get that share certificate off Henry?
No, Dad, and I'm not going to.
Lady Lavender gave it to him.
Now, look, Ivy, she promised them shares to me.
When I sell them to Sir Ralph, I'll have enough money to make you and me independent for life.
I'm not doing it, Dad.
I'm having no part of it.
In that case, I'll make me own arrangements.
-Dad, that's stealing!
-No, it's not, I'm going to pawn it.
I'll raise enough to give Henry the 200 quid I promised him and then I'll get it back when I sell the shares.
Ah, Stokes, it's payday for the domestic staff, isn't it?
That is correct, sir.
How quickly it comes round.
Far too quickly if you ask me.
Excuse me, m'lordship, this little corner here hasn't been Goblined.
Can I carry on?
No, Ivy, there'll be no Goblin going on while His Lordship's in the room.
-Just wait, I'll tell you when.
-Yes, Mr Stokes.
There we are, Stokes.
-Get them to sign for it.
-Of course, m'lord.
Had a daily here once who just used to put a cross.
Really, sir?
She knew damn well when her wages weren't right, though.
-Will that be all, sir?
-Yes, Stokes.
Hello?
Where's Aunt Maude's cigarette box?
Mr Stokes, where's the cigarette box?
-It's Aunt Maude's.
-I forgot to inform you, m'lord.
When I was cleaning it, I rather carelessly strained the hinge.
I've sent it to be repaired, at my expense, of course.
Ah, good.
There's no need for you to pay for it, just let me know how much it is.
That is very generous of you, my lord.
-It will be returned in a week.
-Jolly good.
What a first class man.
I mean, what butler would get that thing repaired and then offer to pay for it.
You know, you're damn lucky to be working under the influence of a man like that.
-Your footwear, sir.
-Oh, jolly good.
I'm thinking of buying a pair of suede shoes, James.
I see, sir.
You sound as if you don't approve.
Well, they are considered in some circles, sir, to be effeminate.
Really?
In that case, I won't buy any.
Always better to err on the safe side in that respect, sir.
Now, James, I wonder if you could carry out a rather delicate mission for me.
Well, I'll try, sir.
I want you to take a note round to Miss Cartwright's apartment.
Are you intending to invite her to Miss Cissy's poetry reading?
-Well, yes.
-His Lordship will be most delighted.
What I want you to do, James, is to ask Miss Cartwright if we can borrow her maid.
I see, sir.
Tell her we're short-handed and we need help to hand out the refreshments.
Yes, sir.
She's beautiful, James.
She's got frizzy red hair, a lot of freckles and a slightly wonky nose.
With glasses, sir?
No, but she probably needs them.
I shall send her to my optician.
I know just the sort of glasses that would suit her.
Little tortoiseshell ones.
Now, while they're all listening to that boring poetry,
I shall slip away and nip into the conservatory.
You'll send her to me with a glass of sherry and some pistachio nuts.
I think the staff might take exception to the presence of another domestic in the household, sir.
Who cares what the bally staff think?
The damn cheek.
If I want someone different to bring me my pistachio nuts, I'll jolly well have them.
I'll have 20 girls bringing my pistachio nuts if I want them.
Are the staff getting bolshie?
I mean, is there someone down there who's an agitator?
I'm sorry, sir.
I will endeavour to arrange things according to your wishes.
It's like this, Mr Fisher.
I need 200 quid in cash.
L200?
That's a great deal of money, Mr Stokes.
I know, but listen, Mr Teddy doesn't want the emerald.
So I'll give it you back, you give the 60 quid I paid for it, my IOU,
and lend my L1 40 on that.
Oh, that's a very pretty piece.
-A very pretty piece.
-It's a deal, then?
Now, just a minute, Mr Stokes.
You know as well as I do, I had that emerald for nine years and couldn't shift it.
-But I only bought it off you yesterday.
-Business is business, Mr Stokes.
May I draw your attention to this notice?
Goods once sold cannot be returned.
Come here, you thieving little rat!
You'll give me back my 60 quid and my IOU or I'll bash your face in!
Hold on, Mr Stokes, hold on!
Violence won't get you anywhere.
You're in no position to bargain.
I've only got to take this box to Lord Meldrum and you'll be out of a job.
I don't know the history behind that emerald, but I expect the police would quite like to know about it.
You could end up doing a stretch in Dartmoor.
And it's very damp there.
-Don't you threaten me!
-Now, just calm down.
I'll tell you exactly what I'll do.
I'll lend you the L200 and I'll keep the box, the emerald and your IOU.
I'm sorry, Henry, I've got to have a rest.
Personally, I prefer the dustpan and brush.
It gives me such a headache.
Ivy, there's nothing else worrying you, is there?
No, of course not.
You're not having trouble with Mr Stokes?
No, that was just a friendly kiss you saw him give me in the scullery.
I saw him go into your room last night.
-Oh, heck.
-Well, it's none of my business of course.
Look, Henry, I'm going to tell you something and you've got to swear you'll never, ever repeat a word to a living soul.
Oh, yeah.
Do you swear?
-Yeah.
-On your mother's life?
I can't, I'm an orphan.
-Well, cross your heart then.
-All right then.
Mr Stokes is my dad.
-Is he?
-Yes.
-Really?
-Yes, really.
Oh, thank the Lord for that.
I thought that you and him was having a...
Oh, don't be daft.
He's old enough to be my father.
He is my father.
Now, you promise me you won't breathe a word to a living soul.
-I promise, Ivy.
-Good lad.
Ivy, does Mr Stokes know?
Henry, here's that 200 quid I promised you.
Now there's just one thing, you've got to sign a paper to say that you sold me the shares.
I'm sorry, Mr Stokes, I can't do that.
-Why not?
-I haven't got them anymore.
Lady Lavender asked for them back so I gave them to her.
After all the trouble I've been to to get the 200 quid?
You needn't have bothered.
-If I'd known you was Ivy's dad...
-Ivy!
I'm sorry, I had to tell him you were my dad, Dad.
I would have given them to you for nothing.
I love Ivy.
Oh, Henry.
And I'd like to marry her.
Except for I'm only 1 7 and a half and I ain't got no money.
Oh, Henry.
Never mind that.
Come on, Ivy, we're going to see Lady Lavender now.
Dad, I don't like this.
Can't we just forget about them shares?
We've got a lovely job here.
A lovely job here?
Waiting hand and foot on these parasites.
For the first time in my life I've got the chance to be someone in this world.
Do you know what my ambition is?
I wanna walk in that dinning room where they're all poshed up, drinking port and cracking nuts and going on about the working class,
I wanna say, "Excuse me, m'lord..."
(Knocking on door)
CAPTAIN:
Come in.
LADY LAVENDER:
Shut up!
Come in.
-Excuse me, m'lady...
-Quiet.
I'm concentrating.
There.
Don't you think it's like him?
-Who?
-Captain, my parrot.
It's just a square lump.
That's cubism.
Are you familiar with the cubist movement?
You what?
Ivy's a very simple girl, m'lady.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
You see, her and Henry are hoping to get married.
Aren't you, Ivy?
What?
Me and Henry?
Who's Henry?
The little fat boy, the boots, the one you gave the shares to.
Oh, you mean Steven.
Oh, he's such a nice boy.
Yes, well, you see, he's an orphan.
And he hasn't got any money to pay for the wedding.
Well, the bride's father should pay for the wedding.
Yes, well, he's a drunken wastrel and he's in Dartmoor, isn't he, Ivy?
If you give the shares back to me, like you promised,
I'll give them the best wedding you ever saw.
And we'll send you a piece of wedding cake.
I'd like to give them back to you, Capes, but I can't.
I'll tell you why.
Come over here.
You see, I promised them to him in the first place.
When he found out I'd given them away, life became intolerable.
He just sat there sulking.
Never said a word.
Made my life hell.
He threw peanuts at me.
(Whispering) Don't let him see we're talking about him.
So I gave them back to him and he ate the certificate.
All except the seal.
Did you know that parrots don't like sealing wax?
Cissy, what's this poetry evening thing you've landed us with?
Daddy, we must try and keep up with the times.
Everybody's clamouring to have these sort of people for the evening.
They're the rage of the set.
What sort of people are they?
Are they decent?
Daddy, just because they have beards and don't wear socks, doesn't mean they're criminals.
As long as they're wearing shoes.
We've just had the carpets Goblined.
You'll be well taken care of.
I've asked your Aunt Maude.
Oh, what did you do that for?
Well, I'm her favourite niece.
She's leaving me all her jewellery.
Oh, drat.
Stokes has taken that cigarette box she gave me.
Needed repairing.
She's bound to ask where it is.
I'll get Stokes to bring it back.
Otherwise she'll think you've pawned it.
Where have you been?
Lady Lav really is barmy, Dad.
She made me pose for her while she did a bust of my head in mud.
Then she give it to me.
Look.
You're not wearing glasses.
I'm not wearing a nose to put them on.
Now, look here, Dad, what was all that about me marrying Henry?
I mean, I quite like him, but it's ridiculous.
He's far too young.
I just did that for Lady Lav.
I thought I'd play on her sympathy to get them shares back.
Then she goes and gives them back to her parrot, and he eats them.
I had a fortune in my grasp, Ivy.
-Have you got that seal?
-Yes, she gave it to me.
I wonder if I cut the parrot open and got the pieces out, I could stick it back together.
Oh, Dad, don't.
You're going crazy with greed.
Just think of that parrot digesting it.
Ivy, the print might be waterproof.
Dad, give over.
Look, now you don't need the 200 quid to give to Henry.
You better go and get Aunt Maude's box back.
There's plenty of time for that, Ivy.
Ivy, I wish to have a word in private with Mr Stokes.
Go and see if they've finished coffee in the drawing room.
Yes, Mr Twelvetrees.
Alf Stokes, what have you done with that box?
The lid was broke.
I've sent it to be repaired.
I cleaned it myself this very morning.
There was nothing wrong with it.
That's the trouble with you, James Twelvetrees, you're too heavy-handed.
You must've bust it when you were cleaning it.
If you've stolen it, I shall denounce you to Lord Meldrum.
I don't care what happens to me.
Keep your hair on.
I pawned it.
You've pawned it?
That's as bad as stealing it.
I wanted a few quid for a week or two.
Well, you'd better get it back.
Aunt Maude's coming to Miss Cissy's poetry reading.
Oh, heck.
Thanks for telling me, I'll go get it now.
-What's going on between you and Mrs Lipton?
-What do you mean?
I've seen the little winks and nudges.
I'm not a fool, you know.
Aren't you?
What about all those little private conversations with Ivy?
What's going on there?
Nothing.
You're old enough to be her father.
You've no principles, Alf.
And you've taken His Lordship in.
They're a decent, upright family.
Decent and upright with His Lordship committing adultery left, right and centre?
Mr Teddy putting servant girls in the family way, also left, right and centre?
Miss Poppy trying to get your trousers off?
Miss Cissy and her friends getting up to things that even I don't understand?
Well, they're the upper classes.
We have to make allowances.
You make allowances.
As far as I'm concerned, their allowances are cut off.
Their days are numbered.
I'm in it for what I can get and I advise you to do the same.
(Door slams)
Here we are, dear, eight shillings.
It's the best I can do.
Hello, Mr Stokes.
In a hurry?
It's all off.
I've got to have that cigarette box back.
Here's your 200 quid.
Oh, my, what a pickle you're in.
Everything keeps going down the WC.
Don't muck about.
I'm an old customer and I'm in dead trouble.
Everyone who comes to me is in trouble.
That's my business, is trouble.
Those three brass balls outside my shop are not Christmas decorations, Mr Stokes.
Come on, give us the box.
I won't let you down, you know me.
I'll make it right in a couple of weeks, I promise.
I'd like to have a shilling for everyone who comes in here and says that.
They'll promise anything.
But I'll tell you this, Mr Stokes, you can't pawn promises.
Please, Mr Fisher.
I'm desperate, really desperate.
Please help me.
Well, perhaps this is your lucky day.
I have something you want very badly indeed and you are in a position to do something for me in return.
Go on, what do you want?
You can have the cigarette box and keep the money and we'll be square.
What are you talking about?
In return, you give me access to Lord Meldrum's safe.
-For one of your burglar chums?
-Don't be old-fashioned, Mr Stokes.
I'll tell you exactly what you do.
You scratch one of His Lordship's cabinets.
In a fit of remorse, you offer to repair the damage.
You call in a French polisher, who happens to be me.
I arrive.
You escort me to the room and in a couple of hours, I've done a high-class repair job and taken one or two bits of His Lordship's jewellery.
Don't talk daft.
If that safe's rifled, the first person they'll suspect is me.
Not a bit of it.
All you have to do is force a catch on a window.
Next morning you come downstairs and say, "My, my, I do believe we've had intruders."
Then if they check your room, you're in the clear.
I'm not doing it.
I don't care what you say, I'm not doing it.
Please yourself.
But I shall be along tomorrow evening with this box in my pocket.
If there's nothing for me to repair, I shall be forced to tell Lord Meldrum how I came by it.
The kettle's boiling, Mrs Lipton.
Shall I make the tea?
No, Mabel, I make the tea in this house.
Come and sit down, Ivy, and have a nice cup of tea.
-Good afternoon, all.
-Good afternoon, Constable.
Would there be a cup of your excellent tea, Mrs Lipton?
No, they cut the gas off.
His Lordship's gone bankrupt.
Be quiet, Henry.
No sooner do I pour the water on the tea than you appear, Constable.
You must have a sixth sense.
Or hollow legs.
-Come in, James, you're just in time.
-Thank you, Mrs Lipton.
Did Miss Cartwright say that her maid could come and help tomorrow?
Yes, it's all fixed.
Ivy don't mind, do you, Ivy?
No, poor girl.
Does she know what she's in for?
I doubt it.
I couldn't say what Mr Teddy is like to Miss Cartwright.
No, no, of course not.
She's potty about him, isn't she, poor soul.
I felt like some cheap procurer.
What's a procurer?
It's a man that smokes bacon, isn't it?
A procurer, from the police point of view, is a person who secures the services of a girl of the opposite sex for immoral purposes.
Why, is smoking bacon immoral?
Well, I hope that girl is not coming here for, well, what the constable just said.
I found it most distasteful.
You were just obeying orders, Mr Twelvetrees.
No one can blame you for that.
And what are you preparing for dinner, Mrs Lipton?
Well, I'm giving the family poached salmon.
But we're a bit fed up with salmon down here so I'm making a nice steak and kidney pie.
-With oysters?
-Oh, of course, Constable.
And will there be a portion left over for yours truly?
Yes, of course.
No doubt Mr Stokes will produce a bottle of wine that he's opened for His Lordship by mistake.
It's no good pouring it down the sink, Mr Twelvetrees.
There you are, Alf.
You're just in time for a nice cup of tea.
No, thanks.
I've got a splitting headache.
I'm going to lie down for a bit.
I hope you haven't been carrying heavy boxes about, Mr Stokes.
Mr Stokes doesn't handle heavy boxes, James.
What do you mean?
Just a private joke between us, Mrs Lipton.
Poor Mr Stokes, he looks right put out.
Ivy, you go up and take him an aspirin.
There's a little bottle in my room on the chest of drawers.
Yes, Mrs Lipton.
Mr Stokes has been out a lot lately, hasn't he?
Well, he's got a lot of legal business troubles to attend to.
I bet it's woman trouble.
He's got swarthy Latin looks, and bedroom eyes.
That's enough, Mabel.
It's time you got on with the vegetables.
Yes, Mrs Lipton.
(Knocking at door)
Come in, Ivy.
-Did you get the box?
-No, he wouldn't give it me.
I said you shouldn't have taken it, Dad.
It was wrong.
It was stealing.
Ivy, come round here and sit down.
Now listen, everything I've ever done has always been for you.
If it was wrong, at least me heart was in the right place.
I've always given you a good home, haven't I?
No, it's been terrible.
I didn't have a mattress till I was 1 2.
Well, you had a bed.
When you're young and not very heavy, you don't need that sort of luxury.
I was only not very heavy because I didn't have enough to eat.
We were poor, Ivy.
But every Christmas, I made sure you had something in your stocking.
It wasn't even my stocking.
I never had any stockings.
You're right, it was one of mine I gave you special for the occasion.
And what about that Christmas I woke up and there was nothing in it and you said we'd had burglars?
Stop splitting hairs, Ivy.
I've always tried to give you a good home.
It was not my fault if things went wrong.
Things are always going wrong with you, Dad.
I'm in dead trouble this time, Ivy.
That pawnbroker says if I want that box back, I've got to help him to rob His Lordship's safe.
Dad, you can't.
If I don't, he's going to tell His Lordship I pinched it.
Either way, I'm going to end up in Dartmoor.
What are you going to do, Dad?
Ivy, I'll tell you one thing from long experience.
When the going gets really hard and you're right down on the floor,
-there's only one thing to do.
-What's that?
Nothing.
Just wait and hope something turns up.
-Is the headache gone?
-Aye, but the cause of it hasn't.
Yes, if I was in your shoes, I'd have a headache.
Where's that box?
It'll be here tomorrow.
Yes.
That's your life, isn't it?
Everything's going to be here tomorrow.
What's the matter with that?
I'll tell you what's going to happen tomorrow.
If that box isn't back there by the evening, I shall tell Lord Meldrum the whole story.
You'll be on your way to prison and I shall take up my rightful position in this household as butler.
James, I don't believe what I'm hearing.
How could you do that to an old comrade who served in the trenches with you, who faced death with you, who even shared the last tin of Bully Beef with you?
It was my tin of Bully Beef.
Pour me a sherry, Stokes.
-Amontillado or Tio Pepe?
-Amontillado, please.
I'm afraid I had a rather unfortunate accident with the mahogany table, sir.
-I scratched it rather badly this morning.
-I didn't notice.
I have obtained the services of a French polisher.
He can do it tomorrow evening.
I will pay of course.
That's what I like about you, Stokes.
You play a straight bat.
-Most butlers would blame somebody else.
-I don't hold with that sort of thing, sir.
-Tell the truth and shame the devil.
-You're quite right.
-Good health.
-M'lord.
-Has Miss Cartwright's maid arrived yet, James?
-She's due any minute, sir.
-What's her name?
-I believe it to be Rose.
Rose.
What a pretty name.
Look, when she gets here, keep her downstairs.
Give her some little job to do like shelling peanuts.
Then when I give the signal, send her to me in the conservatory.
With the sherry and the pistachio nuts.
That's right.
I believe the girl to be rather young and innocent.
You will be circumspect in your treatment of her, sir?
Circumspect?
What a bally cheek you have!
Do you think I'm some sort of animal?
Do you think I'm going to paw the girl and drag her clothes off in the conservatory?
With all those windows?
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I should think you jolly well are.
If you hadn't saved my life, I'd be giving you the bally sack.
-I'm deeply sorry, sir.
-Yes, well, say no more about it.
-Just be more careful in future.
-Of course, sir.
(Knocking on door)
Yes.
-CISSY:
May we come in?
-Yes, I'm quite decent.
Uncle Teddy.
Daddy is going to welcome the guests.
We'd like you to introduce Aubrey Wilmslow.
I don't know anything about him.
Except he writes absolute piffle.
Here are some details.
"Aubrey Wilmslow first came to the attention of the critics
"with his stark, compelling poem Naked.
"This brilliant young innovator
"then turned the world of poetry on its head when he embraced Dadaism."
You don't expect me to read this drivel, do you?
I was at school with his father.
We used to call him Potty Wilmslow.
Uncle Teddy, you have such a lovely voice.
Please do it.
I know you think it's all rubbish, but he is quite a catch.
And there may be a man from The Tatler to take photographs.
I don't think we've had our photograph in The Tatler, have we, sir?
By Jove, no, we haven't.
That'll make the chaps at Boodle sit up.
All right, I'll do it.
And will you be announcing the guests, James?
I think that falls within the province of Mr Stokes.
What a pity.
You have such a lovely voice.
Shall I put this tray of sandwiches on the buffet table, Mr Twelvetrees?
No, Henry.
You'll put them in the wrong place.
I'll put the sandwiches on the table, you carry on dusting these chairs.
I've never been to a poetry reading before.
What do these poets do?
They read poetry, Henry.
What sort of poetry?
It's called Dadaism.
What's that?
It doesn't concern you, Henry.
Would they like me to do Eskimo Nell?
Get your mind out of the gutter and get on with your work.
Yes, Mr Twelvetrees.
-I'll go.
-You'll do nothing of the sort, Mabel.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
If Mr Stokes and Mr Twelvetrees aren't here, Ivy answers the door.
If Ivy isn't here, Henry answers the door.
-Off you go, Ivy.
-Yes, Mrs Lipton.
Don't you ever answer the door?
Only if the mood takes me.
I don't care who answers the bloody door.
What did you say?
Nothing, Mrs Lipton.
-Where's Ivy?
-She's answering the door.
Who is it, Ivy?
It's a Mr Fisher.
He says he's a French polisher.
It's all right.
I sent for him.
This way, Mr Fisher.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
Good evening.
What's a French polisher doing here at this time of night?
Well, I haven't scratched nothing so don't blame me.
I can't remember the last time I scratched anything.
I'll go and see what's happening.
Wait here.
GEORGE:
Come in.
-The French polisher has arrived, m'lord.
-Right.
Send him in.
This way.
-Good evening.
-Good evening, my lord.
Are you going to make some funny smells?
Not offensive ones, Your Lordship.
Well, we've got a poetry thing over in the dining room, but we won't be coming in here.
-May he carry on, sir?
-Yes, of course.
I'll go and see what the girls are up to.
-Where's the cigarette box?
-Here you are.
And here's the emerald and your IOU.
-Now, where's the safe?
-Over there.
And here's the scratch.
That should take me about one hour.
That lock won't be much bother.
Ten minutes should see that sprung.
-The sooner you're out of here, the better.
-I've got to make a nice job of it.
Otherwise they might get suspicious.
We don't want that, do we?
Get on with it.
(Bell ringing)
Dad, who's that French polisher?
-He's brought the cigarette box back.
-Is he going to rob the safe?
-Yes, Ivy.
-Well, then stop him.
How can I?
He's got me.
-What are you going to do?
-He'll be in there an hour yet.
I'll think of something.
(Bell ringing)
That will be the poetry people.
-Are you answering the door, Mr Stokes?
-No, I don't answer the door, James.
You answer the door.
Are you trying to tell me my job?
(Bell ringing)
Don't keep them waiting, James.
-I feel terribly nervous.
-Whatever for, you silly goose?
-You wouldn't laugh, will you, Daddy?
-I'll try not to.
Henry, do you know Miss Cartwright's maid called Rose?
Miss Cartwright's "Maid Called Rose"?
No, I'm sorry, I don't know it.
Anyway, he won't let me do a poem.
Mr Hamish Kintyre.
Miss Lucille Pennhaligan.
-How do you do?
-Miss Francesca Dyke-Hardy.
-Good evening.
-And Mr Aubrey Wilmslow.
Good evening, Mr Wilmslow.
My daughters think you're the cat's pyjamas.
-What does that mean?
-Well, it's sort of modern American slang, like "gee whiz" and "swell" and "I'll tell the world".
Really.
-What on earth is that?
-It's a Singerphone, Daddy.
-Aubrey writes poetry for the Singerphone.
-Oh, I see.
Does he blow it?
No, he speaks into it.
Gives the words roundness.
Absolutely furious.
That fool Francesca Dyke-Hardy left the stand behind.
Well, that's all right.
The boy will hold it.
Oh, Jerry darling, how lovely to see you.
-I brought Cissy's chum Penelope.
-Oh, you are a dear.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
Are you one of the poets?
I'm Jerry.
You know Jerry, Daddy.
He's been here dozens of times.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Get yourself a pew.
Doesn't have a very strong personality, does he?
-Miss Penelope Barrington-Blake.
-Hello.
Hello, Penelope.
-Cissy's over there.
-Oh, thanks.
-Cissy, darling.
-Penelope!
Oh, you look divine.
Do girls usually kiss each other on the lips these days?
-I don't know.
I always kiss girls on the lips.
-Yes, well, we all know about that.
Lady Maude Sainsbury.
Aunt Maude.
George.
-Where's my cigarette box?
-In a place of honour, in the drawing room.
Oh dear, they're all arriving thick and fast now.
Them poets are a funny looking lot.
-Have we hid the silver?
-I don't think they'd steal, though Lord knows what else they get up to.
-Good evening, all.
-Good evening, Constable.
I've been standing outside for the last 1 0 minutes.
It was a regular pantomime.
There was one young fellow with a great big horn thing like a dunce's cap under his arm.
Is he going to stick it on his head?
Oh, well, I expect Ivy'll tell us all about it later on.
There's a young girl waiting outside.
Oh, that must be that girl Rose that James was telling us about.
What's she doing out there?
Come in, dear.
You're Rose, aren't you?
(Inaudible)
I beg your pardon?
Speak up, dear.
You don't have to be afraid of the police.
Ah.
Rose couldn't come.
She sent this one instead.
What's your name?
-Oh, this is Emma.
-Oh, well.
Hang your coat up, Emma, and sit yourself down.
Mr Twelvetrees will give you your orders later.
My cigarette box is on the desk.
Yes, m'lady.
His Lordship takes great pride in it.
There's a strange man in there.
Praying on his knees to a lot of little bottles.
-Oh, is he one of the poets?
-I expect so, Your Ladyship.
Oh, how thrilling.
Dad, you look awful.
-He'll have the safe opened up in a minute, Ivy.
-What are we gonna do?
Go upstairs and pack your bag.
We can't run away.
That'll make it look worse.
-You've got to stop him.
-How can I?
He's only got to say two words to His Lordship and I'll end up in the clink.
-Dad, don't.
-Get in there and act natural.
-We're all here now, Daddy.
Should we start?
-All right.
-Bang something, James, will you?
-M'lord.
Good evening, everybody.
Welcome to this recital thing by Aubrey Wilmslow and his troupe.
Now, one thing about being British is that these days, we are not stick-in-the-muds.
So if there is something new around, we are quite prepared to give it a go, whether we like it or not.
Anyway, here is my brother, Teddy.
Aubrey Wilmslow first came to the attention of the critics when he recited his compelling poem Stark Naked.
I'm not surprised.
Shh!
I mean, his stark, compelling poem entitled Naked.
Um...
Oh, Aubrey Wilmslow.
Now, this is my latest poem for voice and Singerphone.
And it's called
Lost souls, lost souls, wandering, wandering.
Lost souls, lost souls
Wandering, wandering
Lost souls, lost souls
Pondering
Lost souls, lost souls!
Where to go?
Where to go?
Wandering, wandering
They see the cliff ahead
Is it the answer
Or just chalk?
Is it the answer?
"Yes, yes," they cry!
"Yes, yes."
Or is it chalk?
No!
Forward, over the cliff like yellow lemmings
One by one, over, over
But the tide is out
-Has he finished?
-I think so.
Brilliant!
What was that about yellow lemons going over the cliff?
Shut up, Jerry.
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
-Your sherry and pistachio nuts, sir.
-Jolly good show.
You're not Rose.
She hasn't got a wonky nose.
You've brought the wrong bally girl.
Rose was indisposed.
Miss Cartwright thought Emma might do.
You've ruined my evening.
Now I've got to go back and listen to that silly poetry.
Go away.
(Playing Jaws-like theme music)
Dad, I can't stand this any longer.
If you're not going to do something about it, I am.
(Jaws-like theme music continues)
(Music slows)
(Music intensifies)
Don't worry, Emma.
I'll see you get your money.
Please, Mr Twelvetrees, you've got to help me.
I know you're really a kind man at heart, although you cover it up.
Mr Stokes is a good man deep down.
Ivy, I've known him for many years.
I am not going to risk going to prison to save his skin.
Oh, please don't let me down.
I've always looked up to you.
I've always felt that if I was in trouble, you are the one I could turn to.
But you're not in trouble, Ivy.
Why should you worry yourself over Alf Stokes?
'Cause he's me dad.
Oh, Ivy, I am sorry.
-Oh, please, please help me.
-Now, I need to think.
I'll do what I can.
And, Ivy, you are a good girl.
I am doing this for you.
-Where's he going?
-I've told him everything.
-You've done what?
-He's going to help you.
Him help me?
He hates my guts.
You've really done it now, Ivy.
Wretched thing.
(Door opening)
Ah, cook says would you care for a cup of cocoa?
Oh, that's very kind of you, but no thank you.
I mustn't stop while it's tacky.
I have to keep the flow going.
As you wish.
...crouching in a flower pot
Looking through the hole in the bottom
In the bottom!
I'm safe in my flower pot
I'll stay looking through the hole
In the bottom
CHORUS:
In the bottom.
Constable Wilson, I want you to come with me into the drawing room.
-I beg your pardon?
-Please, no questions.
Mr Stokes, I want you to come, too.
There you are.
What did I tell you, Ivy?
That's your friend for you.
(Ivy sobbing)
Ivy, whatever is going on?
I'm sorry, Mrs Lipton.
You'll find out soon enough.
-There he is, Officer.
-What's going on?
-Is that your coat?
-Yeah, what about it?
Would you feel in the pocket, Officer?
I didn't take it.
Somebody must have put it there.
Oh, dear, oh dear, where have I heard that before?
Now, I don't want any fuss.
His Lordship's having a do next door.
And I'll not have him disturbed.
You come with me.
I'm taking you downstairs.
Come on.
-Where have you been?
-Mind your own bally business.
You've missed the best bit.
Mrs Lipton, this may be rather unpleasant.
-Would the ladies mind leaving us?
-Oh, yes.
Yes, Constable.
I think Ivy should stay.
She's a witness.
Very well, you stay, Ivy.
Now, what have you got to say for yourself?
I think you better ask Mr Stokes about all this.
Yeah, well...
-It was like this...
-Just a moment, Mr Stokes.
Do you not remember this man?
He was with us in the trenches, was he not?
-Was he?
-Yes.
He saved our lives in the war, 1 91 8.
Oh, yes, he did.
Fancy that.
He saved our lives.
Is this right?
Yes, I did.
I saved their lives.
I'm sorry, Constable Wilson.
I know this is against regulations but you can't possibly arrest an old comrade of ours who's fallen on hard times.
I'm not sure about that.
I'm sure Mr Stokes and I would be prepared to make a generous donation to the Police Benevolent Fund.
-Wouldn't we, Mr Stokes?
-Oh, yes, we would.
Shall we say L5?
Well, I suppose all us old soldiers must stick together.
You've got L5, Mr Stokes, haven't you?
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
-There.
-Very well, thank you.
I think you'd better make yourself scarce.
-Oh, I'll see him off the premises.
-So will I.
You're not going to get away with this.
I gave him 200 quid for that box.
Is that it, Alf?
-Less the fiver.
-There you are, and you think yourself very lucky.
Here, hang on a minute.
He robbed His Lordship's safe.
I couldn't get the flaming thing open!
Well, well, that's all settled then.
You know, I've just been thinking, Ivy, if that man hadn't saved Mr Stokes' and Mr Twelvetrees' lives, they wouldn't have been alive to save The Honourable Teddy's life.
They did a lot of lifesaving in the trenches, didn't they?
-Has he gone?
-He's gone.
I'll go and tell Mrs Lipton and Mabel it's all over.
Thanks, James.
Mr Twelvetrees, you were wonderful.
-Just wonderful.
-Now, don't get emotional, Ivy.
You're a pal, James.
A real pal.
You planted false evidence, you lied and you cheated just for me.
The trouble with you, Alf Stokes, when it comes to being a villain, you've got the inclination, but you just haven't got the talent.

You rang, m'lord?
# Stepping out on the town The social whirl goes round and round
# The rich are up, the poor are down #
You rang, m'lord?

WE DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS.
MR. ESCALANTE.

[BELL RINGS]
I'M RAQUEL ORTEGA, MATH DEPARTMENT CHAIRMAN.

WE'VE SEENVATOS LIKE YOU BEFORE.
YOU'LL BE HURTING SOON.
PONTE TRUCHA, ¿¿HUH?
I WAS SO WORRIED
THAT THE KIDS WOULD KNOW MORE THAN ME
THAT I'D WAKE UP AT 5 A.M.,
DOWN MY COFFEE, AND DO MATH TESTS.
I FINALLY LEARNED EVERY CHAPTER,
AND THEN THEY CHANGE THE BOOK.
MATH YOU EITHER LOVE OR HATE.
YOU GET SOME PROBLEMS, COME SEE ME AFTER SCHOOL.
THANKS, JAIME.
SEE YOU LATER.

IT'S FRANK GAR-CIA.
WHEN I SAYGARCIA, YOU ANSWER, OK?
ARE YOUR FRIENDS AUDITING?
I AUDITED THEM TO COME WITH ME.
I'MEL CYCLONE FROM BOLIVIA.
ONE-MAN GANG.
THIS IS MY DOMAIN.
DON'T GIVE ME NO GAS.
I'LL JUMP ON YOUR FACE, TATTOO YOUR CHROMOSOMES.
THIS IS BASIC MATH,
BUT BASIC MATH IS TOO EASY FOR YOU,
SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ALGEBRA BECAUSE I'M THE CHAMP.
AND IF ALL YOU CAN DO IS ADD AND SUBTRACT,
YOU'RE PREPARED TO DO ONE THING--PUMP GAS.
RIPPING OFF A GAS STATION
IS BETTER THAN WORKING IN ONE.
ORALE.I'M A TOUGH GUY.
TOUGH GUYS DON'T DO MATH.
TOUGH GUYS DEEP-FRY CHICKEN FOR A LIVING.
WANT A WING OR A LEG, MAN?
WHO EVER HEARD OF NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE NUMBERS?
NEGATIVE NUMBERS ARE LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT.
10 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF WORK.
THAT'S A NEGATIVE NUMBER.
WE'LL NEED LOTS OF KLEENEX.
THERE'S GOING TO BE LOTS OF BLOODSHED.
EVER BEEN TO THE BEACH?
YEAH.
YOU EVER PLAY WITH THE SAND?
YEAH.
FINGER MAN.
COME ON, FINGER MAN.
YOU EVER DIG A HOLE?
THE SAND THAT COMES OUT OF THE HOLE,
THAT'S A POSITIVE.
THE HOLE IS A NEGATIVE.
THAT'S IT.
SIMPLE.
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
-2 + 2 = ...
NET HEAD.
ORALE.ANSWER IT.
COME ON.
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.
-2 + 2.
FILL THE HOLE.
IF I HAD THAT ON MY HANDS,
I WOULDN'T RAISE IT EITHER.
ORALE.
A NEGATIVE 2 + 2 = ...
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
FILL THE HOLE.
-2 + 2 = ...
COME ON.
JUST FILL THE HOLE.
YOU CAN DO IT.
YOU GOING TO LET THESEBURROSLAUGH AT YOU?
-2 + 2 = ...
I'LL BREAK YOUR NECK LIKE A TOOTHPICK.
ORALE.
ZERO.

YOU'RE RIGHT.
SIMPLE.
THAT'S IT.
-2 + 2 = 0.
HE JUST FILLED THE HOLE.
DID YOU KNOW NEITHER THE GREEKS NOR THE ROMANS
WERE CAPABLE OF USING THE CONCEPT OF ZERO?
IT WAS YOUR ANCESTORS, THE MAYAS,
WHO FIRST CONTEMPLATED THE ZERO--
THE ABSENCE OF VALUE.

YOUBURROSHAVE MATH IN YOUR BLOOD.
HEY, KEMO SABE TODO.
THE MAN KNOWS EVERYTHING.
KEMO SABE.
ORALE.OK.
PARENTHESES MEANS MULTIPLY.
EVERY TIME YOU SEE THIS, YOU MULTIPLY.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE.
SAY IT.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE.
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE!
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE = A POSITIVE!
WHY?
MRS. ORTEGA, I DON'T WANT TO BE THE PRINCIPAL
OF THE FIRST SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES HISTORY
TO LOSE ITS ACCREDITATION.
Raquel:
I'M NOT SAYING
THIS MATH DEPARTMENT COULDN'T IMPROVE,
BUT IF YOU WANT HIGHER TEST SCORES,
START BY CHANGING THE ECONOMIC LEVEL
OF THIS COMMUNITY.
THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING
IS TO REVIEW THE RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR ACCREDITATION.
ANY SUGGESTIONS?
ANYBODY?
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD BE TEACHING MATH.
I WAS HIRED TO BE A PHYS-ED INSTRUCTOR.
AS I SAID BEFORE, WE LACK THE RESOURCES
TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THE DISTRICT DEMANDS.
MR. SANZAKI, YOU MUST HAVE A COMMENT.
THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT TIME, BUT...
I'M SORRY, BUT I WON'T BE COMING BACK AFTER CHRISTMAS.
I GOT A JOB WITH AEROSPACE.
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'LL BE MAKING?
LOOK, WE HAVE THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR
BEFORE WE'RE PUT ON PROBATION.
NOW, IF WE FAIL, WE'LL LOSE OUR ACCREDITATION.
WEFAIL?
YOU CAN'T TEACH LOGARITHMS TO ILLITERATES.
KIDS COME TO US WITH BARELY A SEVENTH GRADE EDUCATION.
THERE ISN'T A TEACHER HERE
WHO ISN'T DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.
I'M NOT.
I COULD TEACH MORE.
I'M SURE MR. ESCALANTE HAS GOOD INTENTIONS,
BUT HE'S ONLY BEEN HERE A FEW MONTHS.
STUDENTS WILL RISE TO THE LEVEL
OF EXPECTATIONS, SENOR MOLINA.
WHAT DO YOU NEED, MR. ESCALANTE?
GANAS.
THAT'S ALL WE NEED ISGANAS.
WHAT'SGANAS?
WE WILL BEGIN EACH CLASS WITH A QUIZ.
AW!
AW!
THERE WILL BE...
THERE WILL BE NO FREE RIDES,
NO EXCUSES.
YOU ALREADY HAVE 2 STRIKES AGAINST YOU.
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD
WHO ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW LESS THAN YOU DO
BECAUSE OF YOUR NAME AND YOUR COMPLEXION.
BUT MATH IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER.
WHEN YOU GO FOR A JOB, THE PERSON GIVING YOU THAT JOB
WILL NOT WANT TO HEAR YOUR PROBLEMS,
AND NEITHER DO I.
YOU'LL WORK HARDER THAN YOU'VE EVER WORKED BEFORE.
AND THE ONLY THING I ASK FROM YOU ISGANAS.
DESIRE.
A HAIRCUT.
IF YOU DON'T HAVEGANAS, I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
BECAUSE I AM AN EXPERT.
TODAY IS MONDAY.
TOMORROW'S WEDNESDAY.
FRIDAY IS PAYDAY-- THE WEEKLY TEST.
THERE WILL BE NO DIAGONAL VISION.
YOU HAVE 10 MINUTES TO FINISH THE QUIZ.
IF YOU FINISH EARLY, WORK ON THAT ASSIGNMENT.
NO QUESTIONS?
GOOD.
ANGEL.
VAMANOS.
I WAS SAID TO GO HERE.
[CHAIR SCRAPES]
NICE KNOWING YOU.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
ARRIVEDERCI.
YOU'RE IN LUCK.
TAKE THE SEAT.
RELAX.
TAKE SOMINEX,
BUT DON'T SLEEP IN MY CLASS.
I TAKE THAT AS AN INSULT.
HELLO.
HEY, KEMO, MAN.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE CLASS.
YOU AIN'T GOT A SEAT.
DON'T GIVE ME NO GAS.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
I'LL FLY STRAIGHT.
I GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM.
YEAH.
ME.
NO.
SERIOUSLY, MAN.
BOOKS.
THE HOMIES CAN'T SEE ME HAUL THEM AROUND.
YOU WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE
THINKING YOU'RE INTELLIGENT, HUH?
MAYBE I CAN HAVE 2 BOOKS AND STASH ONE AT HOME?
I'LL CUT YOU A DEAL.
I'LL GIVE YOU 3 BOOKS.
ONE--TAKE ONE HOME.
ONE FOR YOUR CLASS.
THIS ONE'S BROKEN.
ONE FOR YOUR LOCKER
SO NOBODY SEES YOU CARRYING THEM.
EASILY UNDERSTOOD?
WHAT DO I GET?
PROTECTION, KEMO.
PROTECCION.
UNDERSTAND?
I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND.
THE ONLY REASON I'M STILL IN KEMO'S CLASS
IS BECAUSE OF THAT, MAN.
JUST DON'T LET HER KNOW THAT YOU DIG HER.
THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO WITH A WOMAN.
I'M PRETTY FED UP
WITH THIS TEACHER WE GOT.
ESCALANTE'S GOT A BUG UP HIS ASS.
DUDE'S FROM SOUTH AMERICA,
SOME NAZI COME OUT OF HIDING.
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?
GARFIELD'S HAVING PROBLEMS WITH ACCREDITATION.
ONLY THE ASSHOLE TEACHERS WILL KEEP THEIR JOBS.
WHAT IF WE ALL DECIDE NOT TO TAKE THIS TEST?
HE CAN'T FAIL THE WHOLE CLASS.
MUTINY.
COOL.
[HORN HONKS]
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.
CAMEJO THINKS SHE'S SO HOT
JUST 'CAUSE SHE DATESGABACHOS.
IF WE DON'T DO BETTER TODAY,
HEADS ARE GOING TO ROLL.
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN ANYTHING
LOWER THAN A B-PLUS.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU TAKE THOSE MICKEY MOUSE CLASSES.
ALWAYS GET AN "A."
HERE YOU GOT A CHANCE FOR A SOLID "D."
YOU GOT 10 MINUTES.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
I'M NOT TAKING THE QUIZ.
YOU DIDN'T TURN IN YOUR HOMEWORK EITHER.
THE GOAT ATE IT.
DON'T DO YOUR HOMEWORK,
DON'T GOT A TICKET TO WATCH THE SHOW.
GIVE HER THE CHAIR, MAN.

TAKE WOODSHOP.
MAKE YOURSELF A SHOESHINE BOX.
YOU'LL NEED IT.
OK, KEMO.
YOU'RE THE MAN, YOU KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THEM IN COLLEGE
SO DUMB TACO BENDERS LIKE ME
CAN PICK THEIR VEGETABLES FOR THEM,
COLLECT THEIR GARBAGE,
CLIP THEIR POODLES' TOENAILS.
I MAY BE A SINNER,
BUT I'M WILLING TO PAY FOR MY SINS.
ONE-SHOT DEAL.
GO ON, SIT DOWN.
SEE YOU AT 3:00.
GO TO HELL.
I GOT MORE BAD NEWS,PROFE.
I KNOW WHAT I'LL SAY WILL TRIP YOU OUT.
MR. ESCALANTE, I FORGOT MY PENCIL.
HE CAN HAVE MINE.
TODAY'S MY LAST DAY.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
GRACIAS.
BUENO,
DID YOU ENJOY YOURTAQUITOS?
MUY BIEN, SENOR.
MUY, MUY BIEN TODO...
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING--
SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ADD.
SHE SHOULD BE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.
ANITA, VEN ACA, POR FAVOR.
DESPIERTA, MI HIJA.
MIRA, NO MAS.
TE EQUIVOCASTE OTRA VEZ.
PAPA, THIS IS MR. ESCALANTE, MY MATH TEACHER.
MR. DELGADO, HOW ARE YOU?
MUCHO GUSTO.
A PLEASURE.
MY WIFE FABIOLA.
MUCHO GUSTO.
CAN YOU SIT WITH US?
SURE.
ANITA, BRING US A COUPLE OF BEERS, PLEASE.
YOU SHOULD GET ANOTHER WAITRESS.
ANA CAN BE THE FIRST TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL,
GO TO COLLEGE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN.
HER MOTHER WORKS HERE.
HER SISTERS, HER BROTHERS.
THIS IS A FAMILY BUSINESS.
SHE'S NEEDED.
SHE COULD HELP THE FAMILY MORE
BY GETTING AN EDUCATION.
AH, PROBABLY GET PREGNANT, WOULDN'T FINISH COLLEGE.
ANITA, GO HELP YOUR MOM IN THE KITCHEN, HUH?
SHE TALKS ABOUT GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.
NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
SHE SHOULD MAKE HER OWN CHOICES.
UN MOMENTO.
YO SOY EL PADRE DE LA NINA, NO USTED.
SHE'LL JUST GET FAT.
SHE'LL WASTE HER LIFE AWAY IN A RESTAURANT.
SHE'S TOP KID!
I STARTED WASHING DISHES FOR A NICKEL AN HOUR.
NOW I OWN THIS PLACE.
DID I WASTE MY LIFE?
I WASHED DISHES, TOO, WHEN I CAME TO AMERICA.
GOOD!
PUT ON AN APRON, GIVE US A HAND.
YOUR HUSBAND COMES INTO MY RESTAURANT, EATS,
THEN HE INSULTS ME.
EXCUSE MY HUSBAND, MR. DELGADO.
HE JUST WANTS WHAT'S BEST FOR ANA.
SHE COULD GO TO COLLEGE, COME BACK,
AND TEACH YOU HOW TO RUN THE PLACE.
PROFESSOR...
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY,
AND I DON'T NEED YOUR BUSINESS.
SKIP IT.
TIP.
HE PUTS HOTCHILESIN HIS DIP TO SELL EXTRA BEER.
iORA!
iORA!
iORA!
KAWASAKI!
KAWASAKI!
YEOW!
DOG, DOG, DOG, DOG.
DOG, DOG, DOG, DOG.
OK...
EVERYBODY, LOOK AT THE BOARD.
WILL SOMEONE PLEASE READ FOR ME
WHAT'S ON THE BOARD?
ANYBODY.
"JUAN HAS 5 TIMES AS MANY GIRLFRIENDS AS PEDRO.
"CARLOS HAS ONE GIRLFRIEND LESS THAN PEDRO.
"THE TOTAL NUMBER OF GIRLFRIENDS BETWEEN THEM
"IS 20.
HOW MANY DOES EACH GIGOLO HAVE?"
LATE!
LATE!
LATE!
LATE!
LATE!
OK, OK, OK.
OK, OK, OK, OK.
HOW MANY GIRLFRIENDS
DOES EACH GIGOLO HAVE?
ANYBODY.
YOU GOT IT, EINSTEIN?
YOU THINK YOU'LL DO IT?
JUAN IS X. CARLOS IS Y.
PEDRO IS X + Y.
IS PEDRO BISEXUAL, OR WHAT?
I HAVE A TERRIBLE FEELING ABOUT YOU.
KEMO, 5X = JUAN'S GIRLFRIENDS?
YOU'RE GOOD NOW,
BUT YOU'LL END UP BAREFOOT, PREGNANT,
AND IN THE KITCHEN.
CAN YOU GET NEGATIVE GIRLFRIENDS?
NO, JUST NEGATIVE BOYFRIENDS.
PLEASE FORGIVE THEM
FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.
CARLOS HAS X-5 GIRLFRIENDS.¿¿QUE NO?
¿¿QUE NO?
IS RIGHT.
QUE NO.
THE ANSWER TO MY PRAYERS!
MAY I GO TO THE RESTROOM, PLEASE?
IN 10 MINUTES.
HOLD IT.
SENOR MAYA.
HIT IT.
IT'S A TRICK PROBLEM, MR. KEMO.
YOU CAN'T SOLVE IT UNLESS YOU KNOW
HOW MANY GIRLFRIENDS THEY HAVE IN COMMON.
IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE STUPID,
IT'S JUST THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
I'M WRONG?
X = PEDRO'S GIRLFRIENDS, 5X = JUAN'S GIRLFRIENDS.
X - 1 = CARLOS' GIRLFRIENDS.
X + 5X + X - 1 = 20.
SO X = 3.
[APPLAUSE]
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THIS STUFF DON'T MAKE SENSE.
HOW DOES IT WORK IN THE REAL WORLD?
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET SOME GIGOLOS
FOR A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION?
NO, NO, NO, STOP.
JUST KIDDING, JUST KIDDING.
WOW!
CHECK IT OUT!
GET OUT OF HERE.
PLEASE!
WHAT KIND OF MATH IS THIS?
THIS PARTICULAR ONE
THAT'S UP RIGHT NOW IS CALCULUS.
YOU'LL GET IT IN COLLEGE.
MY DAUGHTER USES THIS PROGRAM IN HER HIGH SCHOOL.
I WANT TO TEACH CALCULUS NEXT YEAR.
BOY, THAT'S A JUMP.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
THEY HAVEN'T HAD TRIG OR MATH ANALYSIS.
THEY'LL TAKE THEM THIS SUMMER.
OUR BEST STUDENTS ATTEND SUMMER SCHOOL?
FROM 7:00 TO 12:00 EVERY DAY,
INCLUDING SATURDAYS.
YEP.
THAT'LL DO IT.
OUR SUMMER CLASSROOMS ARE RESERVED FOR REMEDIAL COURSES.
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE, START FROM THE TOP.
MR. ESCALANTE, DON'T LECTURE US.
OUR KIDS CAN'T HANDLE CALCULUS.
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BOOKS.
IF THEY PASS THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT TEST,
THEY GET COLLEGE CREDIT.
THERE ARE TEACHERS IN THIS ROOM
WHO'D HAVE TROUBLE
PASSING THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT TEST.
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN MAKE THIS FLY?
I TEACH CALCULUS OR...
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
WELL, IF THIS MAN CAN WALK IN HERE AND...
DICTATE HIS OWN TERMS OVER MY OBJECTIONS...
I SEE NO REASON
FOR ME TO CONTINUE AS DEPARTMENT CHAIR.
RAQUEL, DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY.
I'M THINKING ABOUT THOSE KIDS.
IF THEY TRY AND DON'T SUCCEED,
YOU'LL SHATTER WHAT LITTLE SELF-CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE.
THESE AREN'T THE TYPES THAT, UH, BOUNCE BACK.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
THANKS, MAN.
KEMO, IT STINKS LIKE LAST YEAR IN HERE.
SOMEBODY GIVE CLAUDIA AN ORANGE.
OK, OK, OK.
SIT DOWN.
YOU THINK I WANT TO DO THIS?
THE JAPANESE PAY ME TO DO THIS.
THEY'RE TIRED OF MAKING EVERYTHING.
THEY WANT YOU GUYS TO PULL YOUR OWN WEIGHT
SO THEY CAN TAKE VACATIONS ON MOUNT FUJI.
KEMO, I THOUGHT THIS ROOM
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AIR-CONDITIONED, MAN.
YOU SHOULD THINK...
COOL.
THINK...
COOL.
COOL.
THINK...
COOL.
COOL.
COOL.
COOL.
COOL.
COOL.
COOL.
COOL.
COOL.
OUT OF THE BLUE,
I GET A LETTER SAYING I WAS FIRED
BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION 13.
I'M DOWN TO $936.
I INVEST 100 IN RESUMES,
AND I BOUGHT THIS SUIT.
I HIT EVERY INSURANCE COMPANY.
MY WIFE WANTS US TO MOVE IN WITH HER PARENTS.
2 WEEKS LATER I GET ANOTHER LETTER
TELLING ME TO REPORT TO WORK.
LIKE THE SUIT?
FABULOUS.
HOW ABOUT THE COLOR?
WELCOME BACK,PELON.
YOU OK?
YEAH, I'M OK.
YOU SURE?
YES.
I SAID I WAS FINE.
[RIP]
UH-OH.
WE'LL GO STEP BY STEP, INCH BY INCH.
CALCULUS WASN'T MADE TO BE EASY.
IT ALREADY IS.
REMEMBER THE GOOD TIMES WE HAD LAST SUMMER?
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN THINGS WERE REALLY JUMPING GOOD?
THE GOOD TIMES ARE GONE WITH THE WIND.
IT'S NOW THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.
COME ON.
A CONTRACT?
YOU CAN'T TRUST US BY NOW?
[BELL RINGS]
FOR THOSE OF YOU MAKING THE COMMITMENT,
YOU'LL BE PREPARING FOR THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT TEST.
HAVE ONE SIGNED BEFORE TOMORROW.
WE COME AN HOUR EARLY, TAKE YOUR CLASS TWICE,
AND STAY UNTIL 5:00?
BELIEVE IT OR DON'T.
WE GOT TO COME ON SATURDAYS?
AND NO VACATION?
PASS THE A.P. EXAM, GET COLLEGE CREDIT.
BIG DEAL.
WE'RE SENIORS.
IT'S OUR YEAR TO SLACK OFF.
JOHNNY, WILL YOU MAKE IT SATURDAY MORNING
PLAYING IN YOUR BAND FRIDAY NIGHT?
YOU LOVE SCARING US INTO DOING STUFF, MAN,
BUT THAT GETS OLD REAL FAST.
HEY, KEMO.
YOU PROUD OF ME?
I'M THE FIRST DUDE HERE.
WHAT'S CAL-CU-LUS?
MOM...
CALCULUS IS MATH SIR ISAAC NEWTON INVENTED
SO HE COULD FIGURE OUT PLANET ORBITS,
BUT HE NEVER BOTHERED TO TELL ANYBODY
UNTIL THIS OTHER SCIENTIST GUY
TOLD EVERYBODYHE HAD INVENTED CALCULUS.
BUT THE STUPID GUY GOT IT ALL WRONG,
AND SO NEWTON HAD TO GO PUBLIC
AND CORRECT HIS MISTAKES.
ISN'T THAT NEAT?
FOR A GENIUS, NEWTON WAS AN IDIOT.
DON'T WORRY, MOM.
IF I INVENT SOMETHING, I'LL BE SURE TO GET PAID.
I HOPE THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE
TO STAY OUT ALL HOURS?

SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS ARE TIME AND A HALF.
2 YEARS IN THE UNION, I'LL MAKE MORE THAN YOU.
KEMO, I DON'T WANT TO LET YOU DOWN,
BUT THE MONEY WILL BUY A NEW TRANS AM.
NOBODY CRUISES THROUGH LIFE.

IT'S THE RADIUS OF ROTATION.
THAT'S IT.
ANYBODY GOT ANY QUESTIONS?
ANYBODY CAN DO IT
AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER ONE BASIC ELEMENT,
AND THAT'S THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
STAY AWAKE 'CAUSE YOU'RE WAKING UP.
BRING TOOTHPICKS TO PINCH OPEN YOUR EYES.
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN?
I WAS SWIMMING WITH DOLPHINS,
WHISPERING IMAGINARY NUMBERS,
LOOKING FOR THE FOURTH DIMENSION.
GOOD!
GO BACK TO SLEEP.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
OK, ANY QUESTIONS?
YES?

OK.
OK, YOU SHOULD HAVE IT BY NOW.
OK, WHAT'S THE ANSWER?
ANYBODY?
CLAUDIA?

YOU KNOW THERE'S PIZZA, 'CAUSE THEY DELIVER.
WE CAN GET FRIED CHICKEN, HAMBURGERS WITH CHEESE.
JEEZ, WE'LL NEED DONATIONS.
YOU OWE ME MONEY ANYWAY.
YOU DON'T DESERVE THE GRADES YOU'RE GETTING.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

SHE'S GOT MORE BOYFRIENDS THAN ELIZABETH TAYLOR.
I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU USING MY PERSONAL LIFE
TO ENTERTAIN THIS CLASS.
CLAUDIA!
OK, OK.
EVERYTHING IS FALLING APART RIGHT NOW.
MY BOYFRIEND'S FREAKING OUT...
MY MOM...
SCHOOL SUCKS.
I'M IN THAT CLASSROOM ALL DAY, KEMO.
LOOK AT MY CLOTHES,

I HATE MY LIFE.

OK.

HOW WILL YOU PAY?
IF WE COULD PAY,
WE'D GO TO A REGULAR HOSPITAL.
MY GRANDMOTHER COULD CATCH PNEUMONIA.
OK.
TAKE A SEAT.
WE'LL CALL YOUR NUMBER.
MA'AM, YOU'LL HAVE TO BRING HIM IN.
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GET AROUND THAT.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
YOU'LL HAVE TO BRING HIM IN.
MM-MMM.
TRY THE SHORT CUT.
THIS IS EASY.
BABY STUFF FOR BOY SCOUTS.
MY MIND DON'T WORK THIS WAY.
TIC-TAC-TOE.
PIECE OF CAKE UPSIDE-DOWN.
WATCH FOR THE GREEN LIGHT.
I'VE BEEN WITH YOU GUYS 2 YEARS!
EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M THE DUMBEST!
I CAN'T HANDLE CALCULUS!
THEY HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
OF MAKING THE A.P. TEST WITHOUT ME.
DON'T LAUGH.
HOW COULD WE LAUGH?
YOU'RE BREAKING OUR HEARTS.
DON'T DO THIS, KEMO.
HOW NOBLE-- TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF.
DO YOU HAVE THEGANAS?
YES!
SHOULD I DO IT FOR YOU?
YES!
SAY NO!
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET TOUGH.
WE'LL WORK RIGHT THROUGH CHRISTMAS BREAK.
THE COUNSELOR WAS JUST HERE LOOKING FOR YOU.

THAT GUY'S GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN YOU.
TIC...
TAC...

SHE'S A LITTLE SLOPPY WITH HER HOMEWORK.
DAD, GET OFF THE PHONE SO WE CAN EAT.
NO.
SHE'S A TOP STUDENT.
YOUR FATHER WORKS 60 HOURS A WEEK,
THEN HE VOLUNTEERS TO TEACH NIGHT SCHOOL FOR FREE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU, TOO.
HE'S VISITING JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
IN HIS SPARE TIME.
CORN AND POTATOES?
¿¿WHAT HAPPENED TO THELOMO MONTADO,
PIQUE A LO MACHO?
JAIME, I DON'T WANT YOU TO TEACH THIS HOLIDAY.
NO.
NO TEACHING...
PAPA...
THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
HIS OWN SON HAS PROBLEMS WITH MATH.
NO BOOKS AT THE TABLE.
GO WASH YOUR HANDS.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
I'LL GET IT.
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?
¿¿OH, SENORA, COMO ESTA?
MUY BIEN.
SENOR ESCALANTE,
ANGELITO TIENE QUE REGRESAR A LA ESCUELA.
EL NO PUEDE PERDER SU LONCHE.
NO SE PREOCUPE, SENORA.
PASELE, POR FAVOR.
MUCHO GUSTO.
MI ESPOSA.
I'VE SEEN YOU DO LOTS OF UNDERHANDED TRICKS,
BUT BRINGING YOUR ABUELITATO MY HOUSE
AT CHRISTMASTIME?
COME ON.
I NEED CALCULUS
TO TAKE ME TO A GOOD CAREER.
SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.
iCARAY!
?
ON THE FIRST DAY OF CHRISTMAS ?
?
A CHOLO CAME TO ME... ?
THIS IS WHAT'S GIVEN.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE AREA BOUNDED BY THE CURVE.
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS?
ANYBODY.
0 TO pi OVER 2.
WRONG.
LUPE.
0 TO pi OVER 2?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THIS IS REVIEW.
I CHECKED MY WORK TWICE.
CHECK IT AGAIN.
MINE'S THE SAME ASGORDITA.
DON'T CALL ME GORDITA, PENDEJO.
IT'S 0 TO pi OVER 2.
I GOT THE SAME THING.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS.
NO WAY!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THIS IS REVIEW!
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A BLIND MAN IN A DARK ROOM
LOOKING FOR A BLACK CAT THAT ISN'T THERE!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
YOU'RE GIVING ME A SHOT FROM THE BACK!
[DOOR SLAMS]
KEMO FINALLY BLEW A HEAD GASKET.
IT'S A PEN.
Class:
IT'S A PEN.
IT'S A PENCIL.

IT'S A PENCIL.
IT'S A CHAIR.

IT'S A CHAIR.
IT'S A LIGHT.

IT'S A LIGHT.
IT'S A WINDOW.

IT'S A WINDOW.
IT'S IN THE ROOM ON THE TABLE.
IT'S 10:00.
Class:
IT'S IN THE ROOM ON THE TABLE.
IT'S 10:00.
UN MOMENTO, POR FAVOR.
Class:
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.
OH!
PAGE 456, PLEASE.
COME ON, YOU GUYS. 456.
WILL YOU SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN, MAN?
WE TOLD HIM TO TAKE IT EASY.
IT'S OUR FAULT.
WE SIT BACK
AND WATCH HIM BURN IN.
IT'S BURN OUT.
HE BROUGHT IT ON HIMSELF.
HE ASKED FOR IT.
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
YOU'RE A WANNA-BE CHOLOASSHOLE, MAN.
[SPIT]
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.
YOU WANT ME?
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS!
ALL RIGHT, BREAK IT UP!
PANCHO!
JUST BREAK IT UP.
NOW, JUST SETTLE DOWN.
LATER.
SETTLE DOWN, ANGEL.
NOW MR. ESCALANTE IS OK.
HE SUFFERED A MILD HEART ATTACK,
AND HE'LL BE UNDER OBSERVATION FOR THE TIME BEING.
MR. SCHLOSS IS YOUR SUBSTITUTE.
NOW, OUT OF RESPECT TO MR. ESCALANTE,
PLEASE GIVE HIM YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.
NOW I DON'T WANT ANY MORE TROUBLE FROM THIS ROOM.
ALL RIGHT, PANCHO, YOU COME WITH ME.
ANGEL, LET'S GO.
TITO, TAKE YOUR SEAT.
MR. MOLINA HAS INFORMED ME
YOU HAVE YOUR A.P. CALCULUS EXAM IN 2 WEEKS.
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I'VE NEVER TAUGHT CALCULUS BEFORE.
I'M REALLY A MUSIC TEACHER.
YOU MAD AT ME, MOMMY?
IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP, I WOULD BE ANGRY.
DAD...
THE DOCTOR SAYS NO STRESS.
NO JOB-RELATED ACTIVITY FOR AT LEAST A MONTH.
I WANT ANOTHER DOCTOR.
JAIME, I HAVE TO GO.
I LEFT FERNANDO WITH A NEIGHBOR.
I'LL STAY WITH DAD.
GO WITH YOUR MOTHER.
DON'T FORGET TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH, OK?
OK, DAD.
COME ON, MOM.
WHAT TIME DO YOU GET OUT OF WORK?
HI!
HEY!
MR. ESCALANTE!
I'M STILL ALIVE.
I'M A HARD-DYING TYPE OF GUY.
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN THE HOSPITAL?
I SHOULD BE WITH YOU.
BULLDOGS!
DOG, DOG, DOG, DOG.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BABY-SITTING.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
HOW ARE YOU?
HEY, YOU SHOULD BE TAKING IT EASY, MAN.
NO, I SHOULD BE HERE WITH YOU GUYS.
I MEAN, YOU ALREADY FORGOT TO STAND UP.
EVERYBODY!
NO, AGAINST THE WALL LIKE A SNAKE.
HURRY!
WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR THIS ALL YEAR.
YOU'RE THE BEST!
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!
THIS IS A PIECE OF CAKE!
UPSIDE-DOWN!
AND...
STEP BY STEP!
ALL RIGHT!
YOU GOT IT NOW.
OPEN YOUR EYES.
Y = LN...
QUANTITY X - 1.
WHAT'S THE DOMAIN?
X IS GREATER THAN -1.
NO!
TO THE END OF THE LINE.
I'M GONE 2 DAYS, AND YOU FORGET ALREADY.
WHAT'S THE DOMAIN?
ALL REAL NUMBERS GREATER THAN 1.
X IS GREATER THAN 1.
I TOLD YOU YOU COULD DO IT.
OK!
BE SURE EACH MARK IS BLACK
AND COMPLETELY FILLS THE ANSWER SPACE.
IF YOU MAKE AN ERROR,
YOU MAY SAVE TIME BY CROSSING IT OUT,
RATHER THAN TRYING TO ERASE IT.
IT'S NOT EXPECTED THAT EVERYONE WILL ANSWER
ALL THE MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS.
WHEN YOU'RE TOLD TO BEGIN, OPEN YOUR BOOKLET,
TEAR OUT THE GREEN INSERT, AND START WORK.
YOU MAY BEGIN NOW.
LET'S GO!
COME ON!
GET IN!
GET IN!
OH, NO, IT'S TOO COLD!
ANITA!
COME ON, ANITA!
ANGEL!
I LIKE TO KEEP MY PANTS DRY, YOU KNOW, MAN?
ANGEL!
COME ON IN!
COME ON!
THE WATER'S GREAT!
COME ON!
OK, FINE!
FINE!
THIS IS SO STUPID, MAN.
I'M COMING!
ANGEL!
COME ON!
COME ON!
[ROOSTER CROWS]
ORALE,GRANDPA.
WE, BEING TEACHERS,
KNOW THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT TESTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT,
ESPECIALLY IN MATHEMATICS.
LESS THAN 2% OF ALL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS NATIONWIDE
EVEN ATTEMPT THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT CALCULUS TEST.
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.
I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE
THAT NO OTHER HIGH SCHOOL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
HAS MORE STUDENTS PASSING THAN GARFIELD HIGH SCHOOL.
NO.
HE JUST WALKS LIKE THAT.
18 STUDENTS TOOK THE TEST.
18 PASSED.
MANY--
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
OK.
WE, THE A.P. CALCULUS CLASS,
WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THIS PLAQUE TO OUR TEACHER...
JAIME A. ESCALANTE.
COME ON UP.
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
YES?
THIS IS GUADALUPE ESCOBAR.
WHAT IS THIS, SOME KIND OF JOKE?
WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO IS THIS?
FOR REALS?
WHAT?
YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.
"IT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE TO GRADE THE TEST
"WITH THE IDENTITY OF THE STUDENTS CONCEALED.
"ONLY AFTER THE IRREGULARITIES WERE FOUND
WAS IT DETERMINED THE STUDENTS WERE ALL FROM GARFIELD."
YOU ALL RECEIVED THE SAME LETTER?
YEAH.
YEAH.
"BASED UPON THE UNUSUAL AGREEMENT OF INCORRECT ANSWERS,
"E.T.S. HAS NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO QUESTION THE SCORES
OF STUDENTS WITH SUCH UNUSUAL AGREEMENT."
WHAT'S IT MEAN IN ENGLISH?
WE COPIED EACH OTHER
BECAUSE WE ALL HAD THE SAME WRONG ANSWERS.
WE'RE TOO STUPID TO CHEAT CORRECTLY.
WHY DON'T WE JUST SUE?
"THE BOARD DOUBTS THE GRADES ARE VALID FOR YOU
BECAUSE OF THESE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES."
THESE PEOPLE ARE HUMAN.
THEY CAN MAKE MISTAKES, TOO.
Ana:
KEMO, THESE PEOPLE ARE CALLING US CHEATERS.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL,
S.A.T. AND A.P. TESTS INCLUDED.
I ASSURE YOU, ONLY MY SECRETARY AND I
KNOW THE COMBINATION.
MR. MOLINA, THIS CONTROVERSY
IS OFFICIALLY BETWEEN
THE EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE
AND THE STUDENTS.
IT DOES NOT REFLECT UPON YOUR SCHOOL
OR ITS ADMINISTRATION.
I UNDERSTAND.
WE'D LIKE TO RESOLVE THIS
WITH THE LEAST PUBLICITY POSSIBLE.
I'D APPRECIATE THAT.
ALL RIGHT?
YEP.
DO YOU THINK THEY GOT THE TEST AHEAD OF TIME?
WELL, CLAUDIA WAS HAVING EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.
PANCHO WAS WAY BEHIND.
DO YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE CHEATED?
NO, BUT MY FATHER DOES.
DAMN SHIT!
LOOK AT THIS SHIT!
IF I'D HAVE TAKEN THAT JOB WITH MY UNCLE,
I COULD HAVE HAD A BRAND-NEW CAR BY NOW!
IT'S OK.
YOU CAN FIX IT.
COME ON, OK?
JUST RELAX.
HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TWO WERE LIKE A THING NOW.
JUST SOMETHING FOR THE SUMMER.
COME ON, LUPE.
YOU'RE SUCH AN ASSHOLE, PANCHO.
LUPE, WAIT.
SHIT!
LOTS OF STARS UP THERE, HOMEY.
NOT TOO POLLUTED.
STARS AREN'T REALLY THERE,ESE.
NO, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IS WHERE THEY USED TO BE, MAN.
IT TAKES THE LIGHT
A THOUSAND YEARS TO REACH THE EARTH.
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THEY BURNED OUT LONG AGO, MAN.
GOD PULLED THE PLUG ON US.
HE DIDN'T TELL NOBODY.
THOSE STARS ARE OUT THERE.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
HEY, HOMEBOY.
iALLI TE LLEVO, MI HIJA!
COME ON, THROW ME A KISS, BABY!
HEY!
HEY,TIRAME UN BESO.
[SIREN WAILS]
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU CAN'T AFFORD A KNIFE?
USE A PENCIL, GO TO JAIL.
CAN I HAVE THIS BACK NOW?
YOU GOT A TOUGH MOUTH.
YOU BETTER WATCH YOURSELF.
MUCHO GUSTO,OFFICER.
LET'S GO, JACK.
THAT WAS REAL SMART,ESE.
GET AWAY FROM MY RIDE!
GET UP.
COME ON, GET UP!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
COME BACK.
ANGEL!
WELL...
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?
ANA...
I'VE KNOWN YOUR FAMILY FOR YEARS.
TELL US THE TRUTH.
NOTHING HAPPENED.
DON'T LIE TO ME.
NOTHING HAPPENED!
JUST LEAVE HER ALONE.
SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
THEN TELL US WHO DID.
WE'RE NOT COPS.
WE'RE NOT HERE TO PUT ANYBODY BEHIND BARS.
IF YOU CHEATED,
LET US KNOW SO YOU CAN GO HOME
AND ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR SUMMER.
PERMISO.
I COME FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
YO VENGO DE ESTE BARRIO,
AND I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WE'RE TEMPTED
TO TAKE SHORT CUTS.
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.
WHAT HAPPENED?
DIME LA VERDAD.
OK.
WE'RE BUSTED.
WHY DON'T WE JUST ADMIT IT?
HOW'D YOU DO IT?
I GOT THE TEST AHEAD OF TIME
AND PASSED IT OUT TO EVERYONE.
HOW DID YOU GET IT?
THE MAILMAN.
I STRANGLED HIM.
HIS BODY'S DECOMPOSING IN MY LOCKER.
THERE'S NO SENSE IN CONTINUING
IF THEY WON'T COOPERATE.
DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS GOT IN MY BOX?
A LETTER OF RESIGNATION.
ANONYMOUS.
MY GUESS IS IT COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE MESS THIS SCHOOL IS IN.
YOU THINK THEY CHEATED?
MR. ESCALANTE, YOU PUT THESE KIDS
UNDER AN AWFUL LOT OF PRESSURE.
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO ANY LENGTHS TO PLEASE YOU.
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL...
EVERY NIGHT WHEN I GO TO BED
I WATCH THE TELEVISION NEWS.
I SEE LOTS OF PEOPLE GO ON TRIAL.
THEY DENY EVERYTHING,
OR THEIR LAWYERS SAY THEY WERE INSANE AT THE TIME.
A LOT OF THEM GET OFF.
BUT I BELIEVE THAT MOST PEOPLE
WHO GET CAUGHT TODAY ARE GUILTY.
DON'T YOU?
YEP.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
HAVE YOU SEEN MY CAR?
NO.
DO YOU NEED A RIDE HOME?
NO, THANK YOU.
KEMO, LET ME TAKE YOU HOME.
[DOOR CLOSES]
JAIME?
JAIME...
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
MM-MMM.
I MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
TRYING TO TEACH THEM CALCULUS.
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
THEY PASSED THAT TEST OR NOT, JAIME,
THEY LEARNED.
YEAH, THEY LEARNED
IF YOU TRY REAL HARD, NOTHING CHANGES.
QUIT.
IF THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE LEFT TO TEACH...
QUIT.
YOU KNOW, WHAT KILLS ME
IS THAT THEY LOST THE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM
THAT THEY'RE NOW FINALLY QUALIFIED TO BE A PART OF.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M LOSING SLEEP OVER THIS.
I DON'T NEED IT.
I COULD MAKE TWICE THE MONEY IN LESS HOURS
AND HAVE PEOPLE TREAT ME WITH RESPECT.
RESPECT?
JAIME, THOSE KIDS LOVE YOU.
[HONK HONK]
[HONK HONK]
[HONK]
HEY, KEMO!
CHECK OUT YOUR RIDE.
WE FIXED IT UP FOR YOU.
GOING DOWNTOWN, MAN,
TO TAKE ACTION ON THOSE E.T.S. BOYS.
HEY, DAD, CHECK OUT YOUR NEW CAR.
Angel:
WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THE PAYMENTS.
GOLLY!
GENTLEMEN?
MY NAME IS JAIME ESCALANTE.
I'M THE A.P. CALCULUS TEACHER
FROM GARFIELD HIGH SCHOOL.
YES.
YES.
I'M DR. PEARSON.
HELLO, DOCTOR.
THIS IS DR. RAMIREZ.
¿¿QUE TAL?
UN PLACER.
ES UN GUSTO, SENOR.
I FEEL I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW
WHY YOU THINK MY STUDENTS CHEATED.
MR. ESCALANTE,
I'M SORRY YOU DROVE OUT HERE, BUT WE'RE NOT AT LIBERTY
TO DISCUSS THE CONTROVERSY WITH YOU.
I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE THE TEST, THAT'S ALL.
MR. ESCALANTE,
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH HERE.
BUT I REPEAT,
THE PROBLEM'S BETWEEN THE E.T.S. AND THE STUDENTS.
I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE WHAT MISTAKES WERE MADE.
I'M THEIR TEACHER.
I KNOW MY KIDS.
MR. ESCALANTE, HAVE A SEAT.
NO.
NO, THANK YOU.
THERE WERE SOME UNORTHODOX,
EVEN ILLOGICAL COMPUTATIONS
FOR STUDENTS OF THIS CALIBER.
MISTAKES IN SIMPLE MATH.
MAYBE THEY MADE THE SAME MISTAKES
BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SAME INSTRUCTION.
I TAUGHT THEM STEP BY STEP,
ALL THE SAME WAY.
LOOK.
YOUR STUDENTS AVERAGED FEWER THAN 4 WRONG
ON THE MULTIPLE CHOICE,
WHERE OTHER SCHOOLS AVERAGE WHAT... 14 TO 18 INCORRECT ANSWERS?
AND MOST OF YOUR KIDS FINISHED WITH TIME TO SPARE.
THEY SHOULD BE REWARDED, NOT PUNISHED.
MR. ESCALANTE, THE EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE
DOES NOT ACT CAPRICIOUSLY.
EVERY MAJOR UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES
SUBSCRIBES TO OUR SERVICE.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PROOF OF WRONGDOING.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TESTS.
LET ME REITERATE.
THERE'S NO PROOF OF WRONGDOING,
ONLY A SUSPICION OF CHEATING.
ONE IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY,
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
IF YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT
OF YOUR STUDENT'S ABILITIES,
ENCOURAGE THEM TO RETEST.
WHY SHOULD I?
IF THEY DON'T, EVERYONE WILL ASSUME THEY CHEATED.
EVERYONE WILL ASSUME THEY CHEATED IF THEY DO.
I WANT TO SEE THE TESTS, PLEASE.
MR. ESCALANTE, WE'RE PSYCHOMETRICIANS,
THOROUGH TO THE POINT OF BORING.
WE'RE NOT OUT TO GET ANYBODY HERE.
HOLD ON.
IF THIS WAS 2 STUDENTS CHEATING,
THAT'S ONE THING.
BUT BY MAKING A BLANKET ACCUSATION,
YOU'RE SAYING THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY.
EVERY CONSPIRACY HAS A LEADER.
WHO BETTER TO LEAD IT THAN THE TEACHER?
NOBODY'S ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING.
NOT ONLY ME.
THE SCHOOL, PARENTS, THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.
SCORES THIS HIGH WOULD BE QUESTIONED
REGARDLESS OF THE SCHOOL.
IF THIS WAS BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL,
YOU TWO WOULDN'T BE INVESTIGATING.
MR. ESCALANTE,
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT INSINUATING
THAT WE HAVEN'T EARNED OUR POSITION HERE,
'CAUSE NO ONE'S GIVEN ME A DAMN THING.
YOU'RE LETTING YOUR EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF YOU.
IF NO ONE'S GIVEN YOU A DAMN THING,
YOU SHOULD NOT BE TAKING AWAY FROM MY KIDS!
THE IDENTITY OF THE STUDENTS WERE CONCEALED
UNTIL IT WAS DETERMINED
THAT IRREGULARITIES EXISTED.
THOSE SCORES ARE ONLY BEING QUESTIONED
BECAUSE MY KIDS HAVE SPANISH SURNAMES
AND COME FROM BARRIO SCHOOLS!
YOU KNOW THAT!
WE'VE BEEN PATIENTLY EXPLAINING OUR POSITION
AND LISTENING TO YOUR COMPLAINTS.
NOW OUR CONVERSATION IS OVER.
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE
THAT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS!
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCUSE ME OF RACISM.
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCUSE ME OF RACISM!
I KNOW WELL HOW TO SPELL DISCRIMINATION!
I THOUGHT THIS WAS OVER A LONG TIME AGO.
ARE YOU DOING THIS TO MY KIDS?
THERE ARE 2 KINDS OF RACISM--
SINGLING OUT MEMBERS OF A MINORITY GROUP
ANDNOT SINGLING OUT MEMBERS
OF A MINORITY GROUP.
MY KIDS COULD TEACH YOU A THING OR TWO.
I'M CALLING SECURITY
IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOURSELF.
GO AHEAD.
YOU DIDN'T SHOW ME THE TEST.
YOU DIDN'T PROVE ANYTHING.
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I'LL PROVE YOU GUYS WRONG.
I HOPE YOU DO,
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT BETWEEN YOU AND ME.
MAYBE NOT,
BUT IF I CATCH YOU ON THE STREET,
I'LL KICK THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.
YEAH, THIS IS GUADALUPE ESCOBAR.
I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE THE TEST AGAIN.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
KEMO, WE ONLY HAVE ONE DAY TO STUDY.
OK. 8 A.M. ON TUESDAY.
THANK YOU.
WHY DIDN'T YOU LET ME TALK TO THEM?
CALL COLLECT.
STICK THEM WITH A BIG BILL.
I THOUGHT I'D SEEN THIS PLACE FOR THE LAST TIME.
WE'LL HAVE TO REVIEW
THE ENTIRE COURSE IN ONE SHOT.
YOU MEAN IN ONE DAY?
CAN'T DO IT IN LESS.
IT'LL BE THE SAME TEST?
MM-MMM.
IT'LL BE HARDER.
DON'T COUNT ON THAT.
JUST GO STEP BY STEP AND PLAY DEFENSE.
DON'T BRING ANYTHING.
NO PENCILS, NO ERASERS, NOTHING.
DON'T WEAR CLOTHES WITH TOO MANY POCKETS.
DON'T LET YOUR EYES WANDER.
NO SPACING OUT.
DON'T GIVE THEM ANY OPPORTUNITY
TO CALL YOU CHEATERS.
YOU ARE THE TRUE DREAMERS,
AND DREAMS ACCOMPLISH WONDERFUL THINGS.
YOU'RE THE BEST.
TOMORROW YOU'LL PROVE THAT YOU'RE THE CHAMPS.
START WITH CHAPTER ONE.
KEMO, WHAT YOU MAKING OVER THERE?
YOU LIKE BRAINS?
GOOD.
I WAS AFRAID
YOU GUYS WOULDN'T APPRECIATE IT.
THIS FOOD LASTS FOR 24 HOURS.
YOU'RE AFRAID WE'LL SCREW UP ROYALLY TOMORROW, AREN'T YOU?
TOMORROW'S JUST ANOTHER DAY, HONEY.
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL SCREW UP THE REST OF YOUR LIVES.
I'M FRIED.
I DON'T CARE IF I DON'T PASS.
SIT DOWN.
WE GOT WORK TO DO.
I'M GOING HOME.
SIT DOWN.
I'M TIRED, AND I'M GOING HOME.
OK?
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
I'M GOING HOME.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
THIS STUFF'S READY.
WHO'D LIKE SOME?
KEMO, LET'S ORDER OUT, MAN.
I WAS JUST KIDDING.
HEY, I HAD TO SEE YOU.
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND
AT YOUR CONVENIENCE.
I'M AN ASSHOLE.
SORRY.
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR
WITH THE PROCEDURE.
YOU HAVE 90 MINUTES
TO COMPLETE THE MULTIPLE-CHOICE SECTION.
DO NOT FILL IN ANSWERS BY GUESSING.
WRONG ANSWERS WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST YOU.
YOU MAY BEGIN PART ONE...
NOW.
OK.
PENCILS DOWN.
YOU HAVE 90 MINUTES
TO COMPLETE THE FREE RESPONSE SECTION.
DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
ON ANY PARTICULAR ANSWER.
CREDIT WILL BE ISSUED FOR PARTIAL SOLUTIONS.
OPEN THE BOOKLET.
BEGIN PART 2.
GOOD LUCK.
FINISHED?
I CANNOT FINISH THE TEST.
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT USC.
IT'S RELATED TO MY SCHOLARSHIP.
CAN'T THAT WAIT?
NO, IT CAN'T.
OK.
DID YOU FILL OUT YOUR I.D. CARD?
YES.
THANK YOU.
OK...
PENCILS DOWN.
MR. ESCALANTE?
MR. ESCALANTE,
DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS?
WE GOT THE COMPUTERS.
YEP.
THAT'LL DO IT.
JAIME, THEY WANT TO GO OVER THE TEST AGAIN,
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
ESTELLE, I'M GOING TO THE FACULTY MEETING.
THANK YOU.
MISUNDERSTANDING AGAIN?
CAN YOU CALL DR. RAMIREZ?
HE'LL HELP US.
HE'S GOING TO TELL ME THE SAME THING, JAIME.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL CALL HIM.
iCARAY!
THIS IS MR. MOLINA CALLING AGAIN.
YES, I DID.
OH, YOU DO?
YES.
YES, I'D LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.
UH...
UH...
ONE MOMENT.

CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.
CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, INC.
Typewriters, transcripts, anything missing?
The key to the ladies room.
Where was the fecal material found?
In the corner.
You'll know when you're near it.
- This was mailed to me.
- Just a minute.
If you don't have a telephone, bring in a gas bill.
We need proof that you live in the district.
I'm Jaime Escalante.
I'm supposed to teach Computer Science.
We don't have computers.
We were supposed to get computers, but there's no funding for them again.
I'm Raquel Ortega, chairman of the math department.
We'll be working together.
You don't understand.
I was supposed to teach computers.
- Where were you last night?
- Where was I?
"Where was I?" I was waiting.
You the new teacher?
Please find a seat.
What are we doing today?
Will everyone please try to find a seat?
If you can't find a seat stand against the wall.
Let's put our desks in a circle and discuss our feelings.
One body to a desk.
Could we talk about sex?
Then I'd have to give sex for homework.
Stand back everybody, please.
I can get you fired for saying that.
What'd he say?
¿Entienden inglés?
Sometimes.
Please move forward if you do not speak English.
All the first row, stand up.
Move out.
I was the first one here.
I'll find you another seat, okay?
Be careful.
This is Math 1-A.
I don't need math.
I got a solar calculator with my dozen doughnuts.
The bus is exact change.
No big deal.
Quiet!
Everyone back in the classroom!
Everyone back in the class!
It was a premature bell.
Back in the class.
That was a premature bell.
Premature bell?
We're not supposed to discuss sex in class.
Sit down!
Stop talking!
They rigged the bell.
Those little bastards.
She's looking good, Joe.
When are you coming aboard?
I get seasick in the rain.
- Have you seen my boy?
- He was riding around here somewhere.
I hear your company's pushing whole hog into PCs.
I don't work there anymore.
Jaime's teaching high school now.
Here's your thingy.
If you got laid off, why didn't you come to me?
We pay kids right out of college $30,000.
I didn't get laid off.
I want to teach.
High school teacher.
Well, good.
That's great.
This is your job.
I was going to do it.
Why do you think I hurried home?
You're not even breathing hard, you're hurrying so fast.
Have a good night, Joe.
I want a burger, hold the French fries, the onions, and the pickles!
You look like Julia Child.
What you got?
It's an apple.
How much?
What do you mean?
What have you got?
Half.
Good.
Excuse my German accent.
What have you got?
Missing 25 percent.
- What?
- It's missing 25 percent.
That's right.
Missing 25 percent.
Is it true intelligent people make better lovers?
What you got?
I got a core.
You owe me 100 percent.
I'll see you in The People's Court.
Everyone please open your books, Chapter 2, Page 26.
Multiplication of fractions and percentages.
25 percent 50 percent 75 percent and 100 percent.
Who's calling the shots, ese?
Have you got a slip?
You got a slip?
You'll have to stand in the back until I can get another desk.
You sit right here.
Everyone please read the first paragraph for a second.
- Where's your equipment?
- Don't got any.
Got to come to this class prepared.
Do the work in my head.
You know the times tables?
I know the one's two's three's.
Finger Man.
I heard about you.
Are you the Finger Man?
I'm the Finger Man, too.
Do you know what I can do?
I know how to multiply by nine.
9 x 3.
One, two, three.
What do you get?
27!
6 x 9.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
What do you get?
54!
Do you want a hard one?
How about 8 x 9?
What have you got?
72.
Wait a minute.
Please make sure you do problems 1 through 20.
Page 26.
Can I have my book, Mr. Escalante?
Don't bring it to class again.
Don't get excited.
Cut me a D like the other profes.
I'll read my funny books count the holes in the ceiling kick back.
First thing, I can teach you some manners.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Lose a finger, I can't count to ten.
We've seen vatos like you before.
You'll be hurting soon.
Ponte trucha.
I was so worried the kids would know more than me, I'd wake at 5:00 a.
M down my coffee and hit the math text.
I finally get every chapter down and now they change the book on me.
Math, you either love or hate.
You got problems, come see me.
Thanks, Jaime.
See you later.
You're in love?
Which one?
Let me know.
No, that's all right.
- Come on, Johnny, don't be afraid.
- I'm not "Johnny."
I know, Tito.
Tito Grande.
Angel!
Go get a teacher!
It's Frank Garcia.
When I say García, you answer, okay?
Are your friends auditing?
I audited them to come with me.
I'm El Ciclón from Bolivia.
One-man gang.
This is my domain.
Don't give me no gas.
I'll jump on your face, tattoo your chromosomes.
This is basic math, but basic math is too easy for you.
So I'll teach you algebra, because I'm the champ.
If the only thing you can do is add and subtract you'll be able to do one thing:
Pump gas.
Ripping off a gas station is better than working in one.
I'm a tough guy.
Tough guys don't do math, tough guys deep fry chicken for a living.
You want a wing or a leg?
Who ever heard of negative and positive numbers?
Negative numbers are like unemployment.
Ten million people out of work, that's a negative number.
We'll need lots of Kleenex 'cause there's gonna be bloodshed.
Have you ever been to the beach?
Have you ever played with the sand?
Finger Man!
You ever dig a hole?
The sand that comes out of the hole, that's a positive.
The hole is a negative.
That's it.
Simple.
Anybody can do it.
- 2 + 2 =...
Net Head?
Answer it.
Come on, you know the answer.
- 2 + 2.
Fill the hole.
If I had that on my hand, I wouldn't raise it, either.
- 2 + 2 =...
Anybody can do it.
Fill the hole.
- 2 + 2 =...
Just fill the hole.
You can do it.
Don't let these burros laugh at you.
- 2 + 2 =...
I'll break your neck like a toothpick.
0.
0?
You're right.
Simple.
That's it.
- 2 + 2 = 0.
He just filled the hole.
Neither the Greeks nor the Romans were capable of using the concept of zero.
It was your ancestors the Mayas, who first contemplated the zero.
The absence of value.
True story.
You burros have math in your blood.
Kimo sabe todo.
The man knows everything!
Parenthesis means multiply.
Every time you see this, multiply.
A negative times a negative equals a positive.
"A negative times a negative equals a positive." Say it.
"A negative times a negative equals a positive." Say it!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
Again!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
I can't hear you.
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
Louder!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive!"
Louder!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive!"
Why?
My point is I don't want to be the principal of the first school in the history of Los Angeles to lose its accreditation.
I'm the last person to say that this math department couldn't improve.
But if you want higher test scores start by changing the economic level of this community.
The purpose of this meeting is to review the recommendations for accreditation.
Any suggestions?
I don't think I should be teaching math next semester.
I was hired to be phys.
Ed.
Instructor.
As I said before we lack the resources to implement the changes the district demands.
Mr. Sanzaki, you must have at least one comment.
This may not be the right time to say this, but I'm sorry, but I won't be coming back after Christmas.
I got a job with aerospace.
How much money?
We have the remainder of the year before we're put on probation.
- If we fail, we lose accreditation.
- If we fail?
You can't teach logarithms to illiterates.
These kids come to us with barely a 7th grade education.
There isn't a teacher in this room who isn't doing everything he possibly can.
I'm not.
I could teach more.
I'm sure Mr. Escalante has good intentions but he's only been here a few months.
Students will rise to the level of expectations, Señor Molina.
What do you need, Mr. Escalante?
Ganas.
All we need is ganas.
What's ganas?
We will begin each class with a quiz.
There will be no free rides, no excuses.
You already have two strikes against you.
There are some people in this world who assume that you know less than you do because of your name and your complexion but math is the great equalizer.
When you go for a job, the employer will not want to hear your problems.
Neither do I.
You'll work harder than you ever worked before.
And the only thing I ask from you is ganas desire... a haircut.
If you don't have the ganas, I will give it to you because I am an expert.
Today is Monday, tomorrow is Wednesday Friday is payday, the weekly test.
There will be no diagonal vision.
Keep your eyes on your own paper.
You have 10 minutes to finish.
If you finish early, start the assignment on the board.
No questions?
Good.
¡Angel, vámonos!
I was said to go here.
Nice knowing you.
Have a good day.
Arrivederci!
You're in luck.
Take the seat.
Relax, take Sominex.
Don't sleep in my class.
I take that as an insult.
Kimo, I want to talk to you about the class.
You ain't got a seat.
Don't give me no gas.
I know about that.
It was a mistake.
I'm gonna fly straight, but I got a problem.
Yeah, me.
Seriously.
Books.
The homies can't see me haul them around.
You don't want anyone to think you're intelligent.
Maybe I can have two books, keep one stashed at home.
I'll cut you a deal.
I'll give you three books.
Take one home.
One for your class.
This one is broken.
One for your locker, so nobody sees you carrying it around.
Easily understood?
What do I get?
Protection, Kimo.
Protección, understand?
I understand.
I understand.
That's the only reason I'm still in Kimo's class.
Don't tell her that you dig her.
That's the worst thing you can do with a woman.
I'm fed up with this pelón we got for a teacher.
Escalante has a bug up his ass.
He's from South America.
He's probably a Nazi come out of hiding.
Don't you know?
Garfield can't get accredited.
Only teachers who act like assholes will keep their jobs.
What if we all decide not to take this test?
He can't fail the whole class.
Mutiny.
That's cool.
See you guys later.
Camejo thinks she's hot because she dates gabachos.
If we don't do better today, heads will roll.
I've never gotten lower than a B+ in my life.
Because you take those Mickey Mouse classes.
Always get an A. Here you have a chance for a solid D.
You got 10 minutes.
Here he comes.
Watch this.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not taking the quiz.
You didn't turn in your homework.
My goat ate it.
You don't do your homework, you don't get a ticket to watch the show.
Give her the chair!
Shit.
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Shut up!
Get back to your tests.
You've got less than nine minutes.
Now you're the show.
What's the matter with you?
Are you the dumb student?
Come on!
3:00.
You'll have to do it anyway.
Kids go to bed?
Papa go to work?
Can I fix you something to eat?
Mija, could you please turn off that light?
Orale, homeboy.
Teacher time, ese.
Tell Kimo I say, "¿Qué hubo?", ese.
Oh, shit man!
Green light, red light?
Anybody?
Late!
Late, Angel!
- Go see the counselor.
- Come on, Kimo.
Go to wood shop, make a shoeshine box.
You'll need it.
You're the man, you know.
Why don't you put them in college, huh?
So dumb taco benders like me can pick their vegetables collect their garbage clip their poodle's toenails.
I may be a sinner but I'm willing to pay for my sins.
One-shot deal.
Go sit down.
See you at 3:00.
Go to hell.
I got more bad news for you.
What I'm going to say will trip you out.
Mr. Escalante, I forgot my pencil.
He can have mine.
Today is my last day.
Did you enjoy your taquitos?
Except for one thing.
Someone doesn't know how to add.
She should be back in school.
Papa, this is Mr. Escalante, my math teacher.
Can you sit with us?
Anita, bring us a couple of beers.
You should get another waitress.
Ana can be the first in your family to graduate and go to college.
I thank you for your concern.
Her mother, sisters, and brothers work here.
This is a family business.
She is needed.
She could help the family more by getting an education.
She'd probably get pregnant.
She wouldn't finish college.
Anita, go help your mom in the kitchen.
She talks about going to medical school.
I don't think so.
She should make her own choices.
She'll just get fat.
She'll waste her life here.
She's a top kid!
I started washing dishes for a nickel an hour.
Now I own this place.
Did I waste my life?
I washed dishes too when I came to America.
Good!
Put on an apron and give us a hand.
Your husband comes to my restaurant, eats then insults me.
Excuse my husband, Mr. Delgado.
He just wants what's best for Ana.
She could go to college, then teach you how to run the place.
Professor?
I don't want your money and I don't need your business.
Skip it.
Tip.
He puts hot chili in his dip to sell extra beer.
Dog, dog, dog, dog!
Everybody look at the board.
Will someone please read for me what's on the board?
Anybody.
Juan has five times as many girlfriends as Pedro.
Carlos has one girlfriend less than Pedro.
If their total number of girlfriends is 20 how many does each gigolo have?
Late!
Late!
Late!
Late!
How many girlfriends does each gigolo have?
Anybody.
You think you got it, Einstein?
Juan is x.
Carlos is y.
Pedro is x + y.
Is Pedro bisexual, or what?
I have a terrible feeling about you.
5x = Juan's girlfriends.
You're good now but you'll end up barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen.
Can you get negative girlfriends?
No, just negative boyfriends.
Please forgive them, for they know not what they do!
Carlos has x - 5 girlfriends, ¿qué no?
"Que no" is right.
Que no.
The answer to my prayers!
May I go to the restroom?
In 10 minutes.
Hold it.
Hit it.
It's a trick problem, Mr. Kimo.
You need to know how many girlfriends they have in common.
It's not that they're stupid.
They just don't know anything.
I'm wrong?
X = Pedro's girlfriends.
5x = Juan's girlfriends.
X - 1 = Carlos's girlfriends.
(x + 5x) + (x -1) = 20.
So, x = 3.
Good to see you.
This makes no sense unless we see how it works in the real world.
Could I get a couple of gigolos for a practical demonstration?
No, no.
Just kidding.
What kind of math is this?
The one that's up right now is calculus.
You'll get it in college.
My daughter uses this program in her high school.
I want to teach calculus next year.
Boy, that's a jump.
That's ridiculous.
They haven't had trig or math analysis.
They can take them this summer.
Our best students in summer school?
From 7:00 to 12:00.
Every day, including Saturdays.
That would do it.
Summer classrooms are reserved for remedial courses.
To turn this school around, start from the top.
Mr. Escalante, don't lecture us.
Our kids can't handle calculus.
We don't even have the books.
If they pass the Advanced Placement Test, they get college credit.
There are some teachers here who couldn't pass the Advanced Placement Test.
You think you can make this fly?
I teach calculus or have a good day.
If this man can walk in here and dictate his own terms, over my objections I see no reason to continue as department chair.
Don't take this personally.
I'm thinking about those kids.
If they try and don't succeed you'll shatter what little self-confidence they have.
These aren't the types that bounce back.
Have a good day.
Kimo, it stinks like last year in here.
Somebody give Claudia an orange.
Okay, okay!
Sit down!
You think I want to do this?
The Japanese pay me.
They're tired of making everything.
They want you to pull your own weight so they can go take vacations on Mount Fuji.
Kimo, I thought this room was supposed to be air-conditioned.
You should think cool.
Think...
Cool.
Think...
Cool.
Cool!
I get this letter saying I'm fired because of Proposition 13.
I'm down to $936.
I invest $100 in resumes and buy this suit.
I hit every insurance company in the city.
My wife wants us to move into her parents' rec room.
Two weeks later I get another letter telling me to go back to work.
How do you like the suit?
- Fabulous.
- How about the color?
Welcome back, pelón!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Sure?
Yes!
I said I was fine.
We will go step by step, inch by inch.
Calculus was not made to be easy.
It already is.
Remember the good times we had last summer?
Remember when things were really jumping good?
That's Gone With tAhe Wind.
Now it's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
Come on, a contract?
You mean you can't trust us by now?
Those of you who commit will be preparing for the advanced Placement Test.
Have this signed before class tomorrow.
We come in an hour early, take your class two periods and stay until 5:00?
Believe it or don't.
We have to come on Saturdays?
And no vacations?
Pass the A.P. And you get college credit.
- Big deal.
- We're seniors.
We get to slack off.
Can you make it Saturday morning after playing in your band Friday nights?
I know you love scaring us into doing stuff.
But that gets old real fast.
Hey, Kimo.
You proud of me?
I'm the first dude here!
What's calculus?
Calculus is math that Sir Isaac Newton invented to figure out planet orbits.
But he never told anybody about it until this other scientist claimed he had invented calculus.
But the guy was so stupid he got it all wrong so Newton went public to fix his mistakes.
Isn't that neat?
For a genius, Newton was an idiot.
If I invent something, I'll make sure to get paid.
I hope this isn't an excuse to stay out all hours.
Trust me, Mom.
Sign it.
Boys don't like it if you're smart.
I'm doing this so I don't have to depend on some dumb guy for the rest of my life.
Thank you.
You don't have it signed, you don't have a ticket to watch the show.
Thank you, Mr. Kung Fu.
Mr. Blue Eyes, thank you.
Elizabeth, my Taylor!
Sophia, my Loren.
Get a haircut.
How many times I got to tell you?
Red, get a new jacket.
Clint, forget your gun?
Unfold it.
Hey, you didn't...
Get out of the way.
- You didn't sign it.
- I'm putting school on hold.
Go back until you sign it.
My uncle offered me a job operating a forklift weekends.
So what?
Two years in the union and I'll make more than you.
The money I'll be making will buy me a new Trans Am.
Wouldn't you rather be designing these than repairing them?
You can't even do that.
They got fuel injection.
- You're going to strip my gears.
- What's the problem?
Don't panic, Johnny.
Just watch out for the other guy.
- Right or left?
- Where are we going?
- Right or left!
- Go right!
All you see is the turn.
You don't see the road ahead.
Open the gate.
We're going to be late.
Why are you here so early?
We're going to Mr. Escalante's class.
Wake up.
Drink some coffee.
One, you got the graph right here.
Two, this is the most important part.
Right here.
The radius of rotation.
That's it.
Anybody got any questions?
Anybody can do it if you remember one basic element:
The element of surprise.
Stay awake!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Bring toothpicks to pinch open your eyes.
Do you understand, Johnny?
I was swimming with dolphins, whispering imaginary numbers looking for the fourth dimension.
Go back to sleep.
That's very good.
Any questions?
Yes?
No?
Nothing?
Okay.
You should have it by now.
What's the answer?
Anybody?
We're going backwards.
You're fooling around too much on the weekend.
This girl's got to do some work from the neck up.
We'll have to stay late again.
We can have pizza delivered.
We can get fried chicken, cheeseburgers.
Donations?
You owe me money.
You don't deserve the grades you get.
Are you late for another date?
She has more boyfriends than Elizabeth Taylor!
I don't appreciate you using my personal life to entertain this class.
Everything is falling apart.
My boyfriend is freaking out!
School sucks.
I'm in that classroom all day, Kimo.
Look at my clothes and my hair.
I can't even comb it.
I hate my life.
So what's the problem?
You're going to have to bring him in.
I'm not a doctor, Ma'am.
There's no way.
I don't do diagnosis.
Are we going to see the doctor before next week?
Hold on. ¿Seguro?
Medi-Cal?
How are you going to pay for this?
If we could pay for it, we'd go to a regular hospital.
My grandmother will get pneumonia waiting.
Take a seat and we'll call your number.
You have to bring him in.
There's no way around it.
I understand that, but you have to bring him in.
Try the shortcut.
This is easy.
Baby stuff for Boy Scouts.
My mind don't work this way.
Tic-tac-toe.
It's a piece of cake, upside down.
Watch for the green light.
I've been with you guys for two years!
Everyone knows I'm the dumbest!
I can't handle calculus!
They have a better chance on the A.P. Test without me.
Don't laugh!
Laugh!
You're breaking our hearts.
Don't do this.
He'll sacrifice himself to benefit the team.
Do you have the ganas!
I have the ganas.
- You want me to do it for you?
- Yes!
You're supposed to say no!
I'm going to have to get tough.
We'll have to work right through Christmas break.
The counselor was just here looking for you.
Something about cosmetology classes.
He says, there's three different levels.
One for boys, one for girls and one for I don't know what.
Go find out.
Kimo, listen.
It's cool.
- My grandmother...
- Clock out.
Game's over.
You lose.
You never listen to nobody, man!
Adiós.
Why don't you send me some postcards?
Or call me on the phone, let me know how you're doing?
We love you.
Kimo Sabe this, cabrón!
Pancho, that guy has a bigger problem than you.
Tic-tac-toe.
Simple.
No.
She's a little sloppy with her homework.
Dad, get off the phone so we can eat.
No, she's a top student.
You're father works 60 hours a week, then volunteers to teach night school.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Now he's visiting junior high schools in his spare time.
Corn and potatoes?
What happened to the lomo montado pica a lo macho?
Jaime, I don't want you to teach this holiday.
No teaching.
I don't understand this problem.
His own son has problems with math.
Give me that book.
- No books at the table.
- Go wash your hands.
I'll get it.
You see what I mean?
I've seen you do a lot of underhanded tricks but bringing your abuelita to my house at Christmastime, come on.
I need calculus to take me to a good career, Johnny.
Something smells good.
"On the first day of Christmas A cholo came to me"
This is what's given.
We're looking for the area in the first quadrant bounded by the curve.
What are the limits?
Anybody.
0 to pi/2, sir.
Wrong.
Lupe.
0 to pi/2?
What is wrong with you?
This is review.
I checked my work twice.
Check it again.
I got the same answer as the gordita.
Don't call me gordita, pendejo.
It's 0 to pi/2, sir.
Yeah, I got the same thing.
You should know this!
What is wrong with you?
This is review!
You act like a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there!
I don't believe it.
It's giving me a shot from the back!
No way!
Kimo finally blew a head gasket.
It's a pen.
It's a pencil.
It's a chair.
It's a light.
It's a window.
It's in the room, on the table.
It's 10:00.
Un momento, por favor.
One moment, please.
Page 456, please.
Come on, Page 456.
Shut up and sit down.
We told him to take it easy.
It's our fault.
We sit back and watch him burn in.
It's "burn out."
The man brought it on himself.
He was asking for trouble.
How can you say that?
You wanna-be cholo asshole.
That's disgusting!
You want me?
I'll kick your ass!
It's Molina!
Break it up!
Pancho, just break it up.
Settle down.
- Later, dude.
- Settle down, Angel.
Mr. Escalante is okay.
He had a mild heart attack and he's under observation.
Mr. Schloss is your substitute.
Out of respect to Mr. Escalante, please give him your undivided attention.
I don't want any more trouble from this room.
Pancho, you come with me.
Angel, let's go.
Tito, take your seat.
Mr. Molina has informed me that you have your A.P. Calculus exam in two weeks.
To be honest, I've never taught calculus.
I'm really a music teacher.
Are you mad at me, Mommy?
If I thought it would help, I would be angry.
The doctor says no stress.
No job-related activity for at least a month.
I want another doctor.
I have to go.
I left Fernando with a neighbor.
- I'll stay with Dad.
- No, go with your mother.
Don't forget to take out the trash.
What time do you get off work?
I'm still alive!
I'm a hard-dying guy.
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?
No, I should be here with you.
Bulldogs!
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Thank you for baby-sitting my canguros.
Have a good day.
How are you?
You should take it easy.
Go back to bed, man.
No, I should be here with you.
You already forgot to stand up!
Everybody!
No, against the wall like a snake!
Hurry!
We've practiced for this all year.
You're the best!
You guys are the best!
This will be a piece of cake!
Upside down.
And...
Step by step.
You got it now.
Open your eyes.
Y = In (x - 1).
What is the domain?
X - 1.
No!
End of the line!
I'm gone two days and you forget.
What's the domain?
All real numbers greater than one.
X 1.
I told you, you could do it.
Okay!
Be sure each mark is black and completely filled-in.
If you make an error save time by crossing it out instead of erasing.
It is not expected that you will answer all multiple choice questions.
When you're told to begin, open your booklet.
Tear out the green insert and start work.
You may begin.
Let's go!
I like to keep my pants dry.
The water is great!
Come on!
Okay, fine!
This is so stupid!
I'm coming!
Orale, Grandpa!
We, being teachers know the Advanced Placement Tests are very difficult especially in mathematics.
Less than two percent of all high school seniors nationwide even attempt the Advanced Placement Calculus Test.
You've been drinking!
I am proud to announce that no other high school in Southern California has more students passing than Garfield High School.
No, he just walks like that.
Eighteen students took the test.
Eighteen passed.
We have an announcement to make.
We, the A.P. Calculus Class would like to present this plaque to our teacher Jaime A. Escalante.
Yes, this is Guadalupe Escobar.
Is this some kind of joke?
Who is this?
For real?
What?
You're crazy, man.
"Tests are graded with the identity of the student concealed.
"Only after irregularities were found was it determined...
"...that all the students were from Garfield High." You all got this?
"Based upon the unusual agreement of incorrect answers...
"...
E.T.S. Must question the scores...
"...of all students with such unusual agreement."
What does it mean in English?
They think we cheated because we all had the same wrong answers.
We're too stupid to know how to cheat correctly.
Let's sue them.
"The board doubts the grades are valid because of these unusual circumstances."
These people are human.
They can make mistakes.
Kimo, these people are calling us cheaters.
This is where we keep all confidential material S.A.T. And A.P. Tests included.
Only my secretary and I know the combination.
This controversy is officially between the E.T.S. And the students.
It does not reflect upon your school or its administration.
We'd like to resolve this with as little publicity as possible.
I'd appreciate that.
You think they got the test ahead of time?
Claudia was having emotional problems.
Pancho was way behind.
Do you really think anyone cheated?
No.
But my father does.
Damn shit!
Look at this shit!
If I'd taken that job with my uncle, I'd have a new car by now!
It's all right.
You can fix it.
You can fix it.
Just relax.
I didn't know you two were a thing now.
Just something for the summer.
You're an asshole, Pancho.
Shit!
Lots of stars up there, homey.
Not too polluted.
The stars aren't really there, ese.
What you're looking at is where they used to be.
It takes the light 1,000 years to reach the earth.
For all we know, they burned out a long time ago.
God pulled the plug on us.
He didn't tell nobody.
The stars are out there, homeboy.
I don't care what you say.
Hey, homeboy!
Throw me a kiss, baby!
That's right!
That's all you know.
Can't you afford a knife?
Use a pencil, go to jail.
You've got a tough mouth.
You better watch yourself.
Mucho gusto, officer.
That was real smart, ese!
Get away from my ride!
Get up!
Get up!
Where are you going?
Come back!
Well, does anyone have anything to say?
I've known your family for years.
Tell us the truth.
Nothing happened.
- Don't lie to me.
- Nothing happened!
Leave her alone.
She didn't do anything wrong.
Then tell us who did.
We're not cops.
We're not here to put anybody behind bars.
If you cheated, let us know so you can go home and enjoy the rest of your summer.
I come from this neighborhood.
I know that sometimes we're tempted to take shortcuts.
Tell me the truth.
What happened?
We're busted.
Let's admit it.
How did you do it?
I got the test ahead of time and passed it out.
How did you get it?
The mailman.
I strangled him.
His body's decomposing in my locker.
No sense in continuing if they won't cooperate.
Do you know how this got in my box?
A letter of resignation.
Anonymous.
My guess is that it has something to do with the mess this school is in.
Do you think the students cheated?
Mr. Escalante, you put these kids under an awful lot of pressure.
They would have gone to any lengths to please you.
You didn't answer my question.
Every night I watch the news on Tv.
I see a lot of people go on trial.
They deny everything or their lawyers say they were insane when they did it.
A lot of them get off.
But I believe most people who get caught today are guilty don't you?
Yep, I know what you mean.
Have you seen my car?
Do you need a ride home?
No, thank you!
Kimo, let me take you home!
Want to talk about it?
I may have made a mistake trying to teach them calculus.
Regardless of whether they passed that test or not they learned.
They learned if you try real hard, nothing changes.
Quit.
If that's all you have left to teach quit.
What kills me is that they lost the confidence in the system they are now finally qualified to be a part of.
I don't know why I'm losing sleep over this.
I don't need it.
I could make twice the money and less hours and have people treat me with respect.
Respect?
Jaime, those kids love you.
Hey, Kimo!
Check out your ride!
We fixed it up for you.
It's going downtown to take action on those E.T.S. Boys.
Dad, check out your new car!
We got to talk about the payments, though.
I'm Jaime Escalante.
I'm the A.P. Calculus teacher from Garfield High.
I'm Dr. Pearson and this is Dr. Ramirez.
I feel I have a right to know why you think my students cheated.
I'm sorry you drove all the way out here but we're not at liberty to discuss the controversy.
I'd just like to see the test, that's all.
I understand what you're going through but the problem is between the E.T.S. And the students.
I'd just like to see what kind of mistakes were made.
I'm their teacher.
I know my kids.
Mr. Escalante, have a seat.
No, thank you.
There were some unorthodox, even illogical, computations for students of this caliber.
Mistakes in simple math.
Because they have the same teacher teaching them the same program.
I taught them step by step, all the same way.
Your students averaged fewer than four wrong on the multiple choice where other schools average 14 to 18 incorrect answers.
Most of your kids finished with time to spare.
They should be rewarded, not punished.
The Educational Testing Service does not act capriciously.
Every major university in the US subscribes to our service.
I'd just like to see proof of wrongdoing.
I'd like to see the tests.
There is no proof of wrongdoing, only a suspicion of cheating.
In this country one is innocent until proven guilty.
Not vice versa.
If you are so confident of their abilities, encourage them to retest.
Why?
If they don't, everyone will assume they cheated.
Everyone will assume they cheated if they do.
I want to see the test!
Mr. Escalante, we are psychometricians, thorough to the point of boring.
We're not out to get anyone.
Wait.
A situation of two students cheating is one thing.
This blanket accusation is saying there was a conspiracy.
Every conspiracy has a leader.
Who better qualify to be the leader than the teacher?
Nobody is accusing you here of anything.
Not only me, the school, the parents, the entire community!
Scores this high would be questioned regardless of the school.
But if this was Beverly Hills High they wouldn't have sent you to investigate.
I hope you're not insinuating that we haven't earned our position here.
No one has given me a damn thing.
You are letting your emotions get the best of you.
If no one gave you a damn thing, you shouldn't take away from my kids!
The identity of the students was concealed until it was determined that irregularities existed.
No one would have questioned the scores if my kids didn't have Spanish surnames and come from barrio schools!
All right.
We've explained our position and heard your complaints, but now our conversation is over.
Something is going on that nobody is talking about.
And you know what it is!
No one has the right to accuse me of racism.
No one has that right!
I know well how to spell discrimination!
I thought this was over long ago.
Why do this to my kids?
There are two kinds of racism, Mr. Escalante.
Singling out a group who are members of a minority and not singling out a group who are members of a minority.
My kids could teach you a thing or two, Johnny!
I'll call security if you can't control yourself.
Do it!
You didn't prove anything.
My kids didn't do anything!
I'll prove you guys wrong.
I hope you do because this is not between you and me.
Maybe not.
But if I catch you on the street, I'll kick the shit out of you.
This is Guadalupe Escobar.
I'm going to take the test again.
You're kidding!
Kimo, we only have one day to study.
8:00 a.m. On Tuesday.
Thank you.
You didn't let me talk to them.
Call collect.
Stick them with a big bill.
Thought I'd seen this place for the last time.
We'll have to review the whole course in one shot.
- In one day?
- Can't do it in any less.
Maybe they'll give us the same test.
It will be harder.
You can count on that.
Just go step by step and play defense.
Don't bring anything.
No pencils, no erasers, nothing.
Don't wear clothes with too many pockets.
Don't let your eyes wander.
No spacing out.
Don't give them any opportunity to call you cheaters.
You are the true dreamers.
And dreams accomplish wonderful things.
You're the best.
Tomorrow you'll prove that you're the champs.
Start with Chapter 1.
Kimo, what you making there?
You like brains?
Good.
I was afraid you guys wouldn't appreciate it.
This food lasts for 24-hours.
You're afraid we're going to screw up royally tomorrow.
Tomorrow is just another day.
I'm afraid you'll screw up the rest of your lives.
I'm fried.
I don't care if I don't pass that test.
- Sit down.
We got a lot of work to do.
- I'm going home.
Sit down.
I'm tired and I'm going home.
Okay?
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I'm going home, that's what.
It's almost ready.
Who wants some?
Let's order out, man.
Just kidding.
I had to see you.
You can't expect me to be your girlfriend at your convenience.
I'm an asshole.
Sorry.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the procedure.
You have 90 minutes to complete the multiple choice section.
Do not fill in answers by guessing.
Wrong answers will be counted against you.
You may begin Part 1, now.
Okay, pencils down.
You have 90 minutes to complete the free-response section.
Do not spend too much time on any particular answer.
Credit will be issued for partial solutions.
Open the booklet, begin Part 2.
Good luck.
- Finished?
- No, I can't finish the test.
I have a scholarship appointment at U.S.C.
- Can't that wait?
- No, it can't.
Did you fill out your ID card?
Okay, pencils down.
Did you hear the news?
We got the computers.
Yep, that'll do it.
They want to go over the test again so that there's no misunderstandings.
I'm on my way to the faculty meeting.
Misunderstanding again?
Call Dr. Ramirez.
He'll help us.
He'll tell me the same thing.
All right, I'll call him.
This is Mr. Molina calling again.
Can I speak to...
Yes, I did.
You do?
Yes!
I'd like that very much.
One moment.
Yes, I'm aware of the scoring.
Three is a passing grade, five is a perfect grade.
I'm ready.
Go ahead.
Diaz, Maria, four.
Sinfuentes, Mark, five.
Narvarra, Jose, four.
I want the original scores reinstated.
Santos, Daniel, four.
Escobar, Guadalupe, five.
Camejo, Claudia, four.
Ana Delgado, four.
Garcia, Francisco, three.
Fuentes, Rafaela, four.
Javier Perales, five.
Guitaro, Armando, four.
Angel Guzman five.
Tell them to hold the meeting.
We have great news.
Pernajas, Juliana, five.
Hernandez, Alejandro, four.
Castro, Monica, four.

Typewriters and transcripts.
Is there anything missing?
The key to the ladies room.
Now, exactly where was the fecal material found?
Back there in the corner.
You'll know when you're near it.
Excuse me.
This was mailed to me.
Just a minute, please.
Excuse me, sir.
If you don't have a telephone, could you bring in a gas bill?
We need proof you live in the district.
Excuse me.
My name is Jaime Escalante, and I was supposed to teach computer science.
We don't have computers.
Mr. Escalante.
We were supposed to get computers last year.
There's no funding again this year.
[Bell rings]
I'm raquel ortega, math department chairman.
We'll be working together.
Nice to know you.
But you don't seem to understand.
I was supposed to teach computers.
Where were you last night?
What do you mean where was I?
What do you mean?
I was waiting.
You the new teacher, man?
You the teacher?
Please find a seat.
Hey, teacher!
What are we going to do today?
Will everyone please try to find a seat?
For those of you that cannot find a seat, please stand against the wall.
Let's make a circle and discuss our feelings, huh?
One body to a desk.
Girl:
Could we talk about sex?
If we discuss sex,
I have to give sex for homework.
Yay!
Yay!
Stand back, everybody, please.
Girl:
I could get you fired for saying that.
Could you move back?
Que dice?
Entienden ingles?
Sometimes.
Todos los que no entienden ingles, por favor, levanten la mano.
Please move forward if you don't speak english.
Todos que no hablan ingles, pasen para enfrente.
This front row, please stand up and move out.
I was the first one here.
I'll find you another seat, ok?
[Jeers and whistles]
Please be careful.
This is math 1-a.
Boy:
I don't need no math.
I got a solar calculator with my dozen doughnuts.
The bus is exact change.
No big deal.
Quiet.
Quiet!
[Bell rings]
Teacher:
False alarm.
Everyone back in the classroom!
It was a false alarm.
Everyone back in the class!
It was a premature bell.
Back in the class.
That was a premature bell.
Girl:
Premature bell?
I thought we weren't discussing sex in class.
Teacher:
Sit down!
Stop talking.
They rigged the bell.
The little bastards.
Tricky.
[Bell rings]
She's looking good, joe.
Jaime.
When you coming aboard?
I get seasick in the rain.
You seen my boy?
Yeah, I saw him riding around here somewhere.
I hear your company's pushing whole hog into pcs.
I don't work there anymore.
Jaime's teaching high school now.
Here's your thingy.
Why didn't you come to me if you got laid off?
We're starting college kids at 30 gs.
I didn't get laid off.
I want to teach.
High school teacher.
Well, good.
That's great.
This is your job.
I shouldn't have to tell you.
I know.
That's why I was hurrying home.
You're not even breathing hard, you're hurrying home so fast.
Have a good night, joe.
Boy:
I want a burger!
Hold the fries, onions, and pickles!
He looks like julia child, man!
What you got?
It's an apple.
How much?
What do you mean?
What you got?
Half.
Good.
Excuse me, my german accent.
What you got?
Missing 25%.
What?
It's missing 25%
that's right.
Missing 25%.
Is it true intelligent people make better lovers?
[Class laughs]
What you got?
I got a core.
You owe me 100%.
And I'll see you inthe people's court.
Everyone, please open your book, chapter 2, page 26.
Multiplication of fractions... and percentages.
25%.
50%.
75%.
And 100%.
Who's calling the shots, ese?
You got a slip?
You got a slip?
Ok.
You'll have to stand in the back until I can get another desk.
You sit right here.
Ok?
Everyone, please read the first paragraph for a second.
Where's your equipment?
Don't got any.
You got to come to this class prepared.
I do the work in my head.
Oh.
You know the times tables?
I know the 1s, the 2s... the 3s... finger man.
I heard about you.
Are you the finger man?
I'm the finger man, too.
You know what I can do?
I know how to multiply by 9.
9 x 3. 1, 2, 3.
What you got?
27.
6 x 9.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
What have you got?
54.
Yeah.
Want a hard one?
How about 8 x 9?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
What have you got?
72.
[Bell rings]
Want to talk to you.
Wait.
Do problems 1 through 20.
Page 26.
Can I have my book, Mr. Escalante?
Don't bring it to class again.
Sabes que, ese?
Don't get excited.
Cut me a "d" like the otherprofes.
I'll read my funny books, count the holes in the ceiling.
Kick back.
First thing, I'll teach you some manners.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Might lose a finger and won't be able to count to 10.
We've seenvatos like you before.
You'll be hurting soon.
Ponte trucha, huh?
I was so worried that the kids would know more than me that I'd wake up at 5 a.m., down my coffee, and do math tests.
I finally learned every chapter, and then they change the book.
Math you either love or hate.
You get some problems, come see me after school.
Thanks, Jaime.
See you later.
Girl:
Leave the tickets at the door, ok?
Can I have my shades?
You're in love, huh?
Which one, huh?
Let me know.
No.
It's all right.
Come on, Johnny.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not Johnny, man.
I know, tito.
Titogrande.
Come on!
[Shouting]
Angel!
Angel, help us!
Stay out of it!
Angel!
Go get a teacher.
It's frank gar-cia.
When I say garcia, you answer, ok?
Are your friends auditing?
I audited them to come with me.
I'mel cyclone from bolivia.
One-man gang.
This is my domain.
Don't give me no gas.
I'll jump on your face, tattoo your chromosomes.
This is basic math, but basic math is too easy for you, so I'm going to teach you algebra because I'm the champ.
And if all you can do is add and subtract, you're prepared to do one thing... pump gas.
Ripping off a gas station is better than working in one.
Orale.
I'm a tough guy.
Tough guys don't do math.
Tough guys deep-fry chicken for a living.
Want a wing or a leg, man?
Who ever heard of negative and positive numbers?
Negative numbers are like unemployment.
10 million people out of work.
That's a negative number.
We'll need lots of kleenex.
There's going to be lots of bloodshed.
Ever been to the beach?
Yeah.
You ever play with the sand?
Yeah.
Finger man.
Come on, finger man.
You ever dig a hole?
The sand that comes out of the hole, that's a positive.
The hole is a negative.
That's it.
Simple.
Anybody can do it.
- 2 + 2 =... net head.
Orale.
Answer it.
Come on.
You know the answer.
- 2 + 2.
Fill the hole.
If I had that on my hands,
I wouldn't raise it either.
Orale.
A negative 2 + 2 =... anybody can do it.
Fill the hole.
- 2 + 2 =... come on.
Just fill the hole.
You can do it.
You going to let theseburroslaugh at you?
- 2 + 2 =...
I'll break your neck like a toothpick.
Orale.
Zero.
Zero.
You're right.
Simple.
That's it.
- 2 + 2 = 0.
He just filled the hole.
Did you know neither the greeks nor the romans were capable of using the concept of zero?
It was your ancestors, the Mayas, who first contemplated the zero... the absence of value.
True story.
You burros have math in your blood.
Hey, Kemo sabe todo.
The man knows everything.
Kemo sabe.
Orale.
Ok.
Parentheses means multiply.
Every time you see this, you multiply.
A negative x a negative = a positive.
A negative x a negative = a positive.
A negative x a negative = a positive.
Say it.
A negative x a negative = a positive.
A negative x a negative = a positive.
A negative x a negative = a positive.
I can't hear you.
A negative x a negative = a positive.
A negative x a negative = a positive!
A negative x a negative = a positive!
Why?
Mrs. Ortega, I don't want to be the principal of the first school in los angeles history to lose its accreditation.
Raquel:
I'm not saying this math department couldn't improve, but if you want higher test scores, start by changing the economic level of this community.
The purpose of this meeting is to review the recommendations for accreditation.
Any suggestions?
Anybody?
Yeah.
I don't think
I should be teaching math.
I was hired to be a phys-ed instructor.
As I said before, we lack the resources to implement the changes the district demands.
Mr. Sanzaki, you must have a comment.
This may not be the right time, but...
I'm sorry, but I won't be coming back after christmas.
I got a job with aerospace.
How much money you'll be making?
Look, we have the remainder of the year before we're put on probation.
Now, if we fail, we'll lose our accreditation.
Wefail?
You can't teach logarithms to illiterates.
Kids come to us with barely a seventh grade education.
There isn't a teacher here who isn't doing everything possible.
I'm not.
I could teach more.
I'm sure Mr. Escalante has good intentions, but he's only been here a few months.
Students will rise to the level of expectations, senor molina.
What do you need, Mr. Escalante?
Ganas.
That's all we need isganas.
What'sganas?
We will begin each class with a quiz.
Aw!
Aw!
There will be... there will be no free rides, no excuses.
You already have 2 strikes against you.
There are some people in this world who assume that you know less than you do because of your name and your complexion.
But math is the great equalizer.
When you go for a job, the person giving you that job will not want to hear your problems, and neither do I.
You'll work harder than you've ever worked before.
And the only thing I ask from you isganas.
Desire.
A haircut.
If you don't haveganas, I will give it to you because I am an expert.
Today is monday.
Tomorrow's wednesday.
Friday is payday...
the weekly test.
There will be no diagonal vision.
You have 10 minutes to finish the quiz.
If you finish early, work on that assignment.
No questions?
Good.
Angel.
Vamanos.
I was said to go here.
[Chair scrapes]
Nice knowing you.
Have a good day.
Arrivederci.
You're in luck.
Take the seat.
Relax.
Take sominex, but don't sleep in my class.
I take that as an insult.
Hello.
Hey, Kemo, man.
I want to talk to you about the class.
You ain't got a seat.
Don't give me no gas.
That was a mistake.
I'll fly straight.
I got a little problem.
Yeah.
Me.
No.
Seriously, man.
Books.
The homies can't see me haul them around.
You wouldn't want anyone thinking you're intelligent, huh?
Maybe I can have 2 books and stash one at home?
I'll cut you a deal.
I'll give you 3 books.
One... take one home.
One for your class.
This one's broken.
One for your locker so nobody sees you carrying them.
Easily understood?
What do I get?
Protection, Kemo.
Proteccion.
Understand?
I understand.
I understand.
The only reason I'm still in Kemo's class is because of that, man.
Just don't let her know that you dig her.
That's the worst thing you can do with a woman.
I'm pretty fed up with this teacher we got.
Escalante's got a bug up his ass.
Dude's from South America, some Nazi come out of hiding.
Don't you know what's happening?
Garfield's having problems with accreditation.
Only the asshole teachers will keep their jobs.
What if we all decide not to take this test?
He can't fail the whole class.
Mutiny.
Cool.
[Horn honks]
See you guys later.
Camejo thinks she's so hot just 'cause she datesgabachos.
If we don't do better today, heads are going to roll.
I've never gotten anything lower than a b-plus.
That's because you take those mickey mouse classes.
Always get an "a."
Here you got a chance for a solid "d."
You got 10 minutes.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not taking the quiz.
You didn't turn in your homework either.
The goat ate it.
Don't do your homework, don't got a ticket to watch the show.
Give her the chair, man.
Chair.
The chair.
The chair.
The chair.
The chair.
The chair.
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
All right.
Yeah.
Uh-uh.
The chair.
Shut up!
Get back to your tests.
You got less than 9 minutes.
Now you're the show.
What's the matter with you?
You're a top student.
Come on.
3:00.
You'll have to do it anyway.
[Coughing]
Te vas a quedar calvo si no te metes la camisa adentro de los pantalones.
Si.
Si.
Mira, huh?
Woman:
Mi Lindo Juanito, hijo, dinner's ready.
Come inside.
Hurry up!
Dad?
[Children shouting]
Vamos todos a la cama.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
In the bed.
Juanito!
Hi, mom.
Kids go to bed?
Yeah.
Papa go to work?
Yeah.
Want me to fix you something to eat?
Mi hija, could you please turn off that light?
[Glass breaks]
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Orale, homeboy.
Teacher time, ese.
Oh, yeah.
Angel?
What?
Tell Kemo I said, "que hubo?" ese.
Oh, shit, man.
Hey!
Factoring.
Ok.
Green light, red light.
Anybody?
Ana?
[Door closes]
Late!
Late!
Late!
Late!
Ok, ok, ok.
Ok, ok.
Go see the counselor.
Come on, Kemo.
Take woodshop.
Make yourself a shoeshine box.
You'll need it.
Ok, Kemo.
You're the man, you know.
Why don't you put them in college so dumb taco benders like me can pick their vegetables for them, collect their garbage, clip their poodles' toenails.
I may be a sinner, but I'm willing to pay for my sins.
One-shot deal.
Go on, sit down.
See you at 3:00.
Go to hell.
I got more bad news, profe.
I know what I'll say will trip you out.
Mr. Escalante, I forgot my pencil.
He can have mine.
Today's my last day.
No, no, no, no.
Gracias.
Bueno, did you enjoy yourtaquitos?
Muy bien, senor.
Muy, muy bien todo... except for one thing... someone doesn't know how to add.
She should be going back to school.
Anita, ven aca, por favor.
Despierta, mi hija.
Mira, no mas.
Te equivocaste otra vez.
Papa, this is Mr. Escalante, my math teacher.
Mr. Delgado, how are you?
Mucho gusto.
A pleasure.
My wife fabiola.
Mucho gusto.
Can you sit with us?
Sure.
Anita, bring us a couple of beers, please.
You should get another waitress.
Ana can be the first to graduate from high school, go to college.
Thank you for your concern.
Her mother works here.
Her sisters, her brothers.
This is a family business.
She's needed.
She could help the family more by getting an education.
Ah, probably get pregnant, wouldn't finish college.
Anita, go help your mom in the kitchen, huh?
She talks about going to medical school.
No.
I don't think so.
She should make her own choices.
Un momento.
Yo soy el padre de la nina, no usted.
She'll just get fat.
She'll waste her life away in a restaurant.
She's top kid!
I started washing dishes for a nickel an hour.
Now I own this place.
Did I waste my life?
I washed dishes, too, when I came to America.
Good!
Put on an apron, give us a hand.
Your husband comes into my restaurant, eats, then he insults me.
Excuse my husband, Mr. Delgado.
He just wants what's best for ana.
She could go to college, come back, and teach you how to run the place.
Professor...
I don't want your money, and I don't need your business.
Skip it.
Tip.
He puts hotchilesin his dip to sell extra beer.
Iora!
Iora!
Iora!
Kawasaki!
Kawasaki!
Yeow!
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Ok... everybody, look at the board.
Will someone please read for me what's on the board?
Anybody.
"Juan has 5 times as many girlfriends as pedro.
"Carlos has one girlfriend less than pedro.
"The total number of girlfriends between them
"is 20.
How many does each gigolo have?"
Late!
Late!
Late!
Late!
Late!
Ok, ok, ok.
Ok, ok, ok, ok.
How many girlfriends does each gigolo have?
Anybody.
You got it, einstein?
You think you'll do it?
Juan is x.
Carlos is y.
Pedro is x + y.
Is Pedro bisexual, or what?
I have a terrible feeling about you.
Kemo, 5x = Juan's girlfriends?
You're good now, but you'll end up barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen.
Can you get negative girlfriends?
No, just negative boyfriends.
Please forgive them for they know not what they do.
Carlos has x-5 girlfriends.
Que no?
Que no?
Is right.
Que no.
The answer to my prayers!
May I go to the restroom, please?
In 10 minutes.
Hold it.
Senor Maya.
Hit it.
It's a trick problem, Mr. Kemo.
You can't solve it unless you know how many girlfriends they have in common.
It's not that they're stupid, it's just they don't know anything.
I'm wrong?
X = Pedro's girlfriends, 5x = Juan's girlfriends.
X - 1 = Carlos' girlfriends.
X + 5x + x - 1 = 20.
So x = 3.
[Applause]
Good to see you.
This stuff don't make sense.
How does it work in the real world?
Would it be possible to get some gigolos for a practical demonstration?
No, no, no, stop.
Just kidding, just kidding.
Wow!
Check it out!
Get out of here.
Please!
What kind of math is this?
This particular one that's up right now is calculus.
You'll get it in college.
My daughter uses this program in her high school.
I want to teach calculus next year.
Boy, that's a jump.
That's ridiculous.
They haven't had trig or math analysis.
They'll take them this summer.
Our best students attend summer school?
From 7:00 to 12:00 every day, including saturdays.
Yep.
That'll do it.
Our summer classrooms are reserved for remedial courses.
If you want to change, start from the top.
Mr. Escalante, don't lecture us.
Our kids can't handle calculus.
We don't even have the books.
If they pass the advanced placement test, they get college credit.
There are teachers in this room who'd have trouble passing the advanced placement test.
You really think you can make this fly?
I teach calculus or... have a good day.
Well, if this man can walk in here and... dictate his own terms over my objections...
I see no reason for me to continue as department chair.
Raquel, don't take this personally.
I'm thinking about those kids.
If they try and don't succeed, you'll shatter what little self-confidence they have.
These aren't the types that, uh, bounce back.
Have a good day.
Thanks, man.
Kemo, it stinks like last year in here.
Somebody give claudia an orange.
Ok, ok, ok.
Sit down.
You think I want to do this?
The japanese pay me to do this.
They're tired of making everything.
They want you guys to pull your own weight so they can take vacations on mount fuji.
Kemo, I thought this room was supposed to be air-conditioned, man.
You should think... cool.
Think... cool.
Cool.
Think... cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Out of the blue,
I get a letter saying I was fired because of proposition 13.
I'm down to $936.
I invest 100 in resumes, and I bought this suit.
I hit every insurance company.
My wife wants us to move in with her parents.
2 weeks later I get another letter telling me to report to work.
Like the suit?
Fabulous.
How about the color?
Welcome back, pelon.
You ok?
Yeah, I'm ok.
You sure?
Yes.
I said I was fine.
[Rip]
Uh-oh.
We'll go step by step, inch by inch.
Calculus wasn't made to be easy.
It already is.
Remember the good times we had last summer?
Do you remember when things were really jumping good?
The good times are gone with the wind.
It's now the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Come on.
A contract?
You can't trust us by now?
[Bell rings]
For those of you making the commitment, you'll be preparing for the advanced placement test.
Have one signed before tomorrow.
We come an hour early, take your class twice, and stay until 5:00?
Believe it or don't.
We got to come on saturdays?
And no vacation?
Pass the a.p. Exam, get college credit.
Big deal.
We're seniors.
It's our year to slack off.
Johnny, will you make it saturday morning playing in your band friday night?
You love scaring us into doing stuff, man, but that gets old real fast.
Hey, Kemo.
You proud of me?
I'm the first dude here.
What's cal-cu-lus?
Mom... calculus is math sir Isaac Newton invented so he could figure out planet orbits, but he never bothered to tell anybody until this other scientist guy told everybody he had invented calculus.
But the stupid guy got it all wrong, and so newton had to go public and correct his mistakes.
Isn't that neat?
For a genius, newton was an idiot.
Don't worry, mom.
If I invent something, I'll be sure to get paid.
I hope this is not an excuse to stay out all hours?
Trust me, mom.
Sign it.
Boys don't like if you're too smart.
Mom, I'm doing this so I don't have to depend on some dumb guy the rest of my life.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You don't got it signed, you got no ticket to watch the show.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Blue eyes, thank very much.
Elizabeth, my Taylor.
Sophia, my Loren.
Get a haircut.
Thank you very much.
Get a new Jacket.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Clint, you forget your gun?
Unfold it.
Hep!
Get out of the way.
Here.
You didn't sign it.
I'm putting school on hold.
Sign it.
My uncle offered me a job operating a fork lift.
Saturdays and sundays are time and a half.
2 years in the union, I'll make more than you.
Kemo, I don't want to let you down, but the money will buy a new trans am.
Nobody cruises through life.
Wouldn't you rather design these than repair them?
You can't even do that.
They got fuel injection.
[Grinding noise]
You'll strip my gears.
Orale, Kemo.
Don't panic, Johnny.
Just watch out for the other guy.
Right or left?
Where are we going?
Right or left?
Go right!
Go right!
All you see is the turn.
You don't see the road ahead.
Orale, buey.
Open the gate.
We'll be late.
What are you guys doing here so early?
We're in Escalante's class, remember?
Wake up.
Drink some coffee, man.
One, you got the graph right here.
Two, this strip, the most important part... it's the radius of rotation.
That's it.
Anybody got any questions?
Anybody can do it as long as you remember one basic element, and that's the element of surprise.
Stay awake 'cause you're waking up.
Bring toothpicks to pinch open your eyes.
You understand what I mean?
I was swimming with dolphins, whispering imaginary numbers, looking for the fourth dimension.
Good!
Go back to sleep.
That's very good.
Ok, any questions?
Yes?
No?
Nothing?
Ok.
Ok, you should have it by now.
Ok, what's the answer?
Anybody?
Claudia?
Come on.
We're going backwards.
You're fooling around too much during the weekend.
This girl needs work from the neck up.
We'll have to stay late again.
Aw!
Come on.
You know there's pizza, 'cause they deliver.
We can get fried chicken, hamburgers with cheese.
Jeez, we'll need donations.
You owe me money anyway.
You don't deserve the grades you're getting.
Where are you going?
You late for another date?
She's got more boyfriends than Elizabeth Taylor.
I don't appreciate you using my personal life to entertain this class.
Claudia!
Ok, ok.
Everything is falling apart right now.
My boyfriend's freaking out... my mom...
school sucks.
I'm in that classroom all day, Kemo.
Look at my clothes, my hair...
I can't even comb it.
I hate my life.
So, what's the problem?
Kemo.
Ponla aqui en esta linea.
En esta linea.
No, no, no.
Aqui.
Calmate, mi hijo.
Esperame aqui.
Si.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I understand that, but you'll have to bring him in.
I'm not a doctor.
There's no way.
Hey.
I don't do diagnosis.
Uh-huh.
Look, I'm sorry.
We'll have... mira.
Could you hold a moment?
Could we see the doctor before next week?
Ok.
Hold on.
Seguro?
No.
Medl-cal?
No, tampoco.
How will you pay?
If we could pay, we'd go to a regular hospital.
My grandmother could catch pneumonia.
Ok.
Take a seat.
We'll call your number.
Ma'am, you'll have to bring him in.
There's no way we can get around that.
I understand that.
You'll have to bring him in.
Mm-mmm.
Try the short cut.
This is easy.
Baby stuff for boy scouts.
My mind don't work this way.
Tic-tac-toe.
Piece of cake upside-down.
Watch for the green light.
I've been with you guys 2 years!
Everybody knows I'm the dumbest!
I can't handle calculus!
They have a better chance of making the a.p. Test without me.
Don't laugh.
How could we laugh?
You're breaking our hearts.
Don't do this, Kemo.
How noble...
to sacrifice himself.
Do you have theganas?
Yes!
Should I do it for you?
Yes!
Say no!
I'm going to have to get tough.
We'll work right through christmas break.
The counselor was just here looking for you.
Something about some cosmetology classes.
He says there's 3 different levels... one for boys, one for girls, and one for...
go find out.
Please, listen, man.
It's cool.
My grandmother... clock out.
Game's over.
You lose.
You never listen to nobody, man.
Te crees el mas chingon.
Adios.
Why don't you send me some post cards or call me?
We love you.
Kemosabethis, cabron, huh?
That guy's got a bigger problem than you.
Tic... tac... toe... simple.
She's a little sloppy with her homework.
Dad, get off the phone so we can eat.
No.
She's a top student.
Your father works 60 hours a week, then he volunteers to teach night school for free.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
He's visiting junior high schools in his spare time.
Corn and potatoes?
What happened to thelomo montado, pique a lo macho?
Jaime, I don't want you to teach this holiday.
No.
No teaching... papa... there's a problem here I don't understand.
See what I mean?
His own son has problems with math.
No books at the table.
Go wash your hands.
[Doorbell rings]
I'll get it.
You see what I mean?
Oh, senora, como esta?
Muy bien.
Senor Escalante,
Angelito tiene que regresar a la escuela.
El no puede perder su lonche.
No se preocupe, senora.
Pasele, por favor.
Mucho gusto.
Mi esposa.
I've seen you do lots of underhanded tricks, but bringing your abuelitato my house at christmastime?
Come on.
I need calculus to take me to a good career.
Something smells good.
Icaray!
?
On the first day of christmas?
?
A cholo came to me...?
This is what's given.
We're looking for the area bounded by the curve.
What are the limits?
Anybody.
0 to pi over 2.
Wrong.
Lupe.
0 to pi over 2?
What's wrong with you?
This is review.
I checked my work twice.
Check it again.
Mine's the same asgordita.
Don't call me gordita, pendejo.
It's 0 to pi over 2.
I got the same thing.
You should know this.
No way!
What's wrong with you?
This is review!
You're acting like a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there!
What's wrong with you?
I don't believe it!
You're giving me a shot from the back!
[Door slams]
Kemo finally blew a head gasket.
It's a pen.
Class:
It's a pen.
It's a pencil.
Class:
It's a pencil.
It's a chair.
Class:
It's a chair.
It's a light.
Class:
It's a light.
It's a window.
Class:
It's a window.
It's in the room on the table.
It's 10:00.
Class:
It's in the room on the table.
It's 10:00.
Un momento, por favor.
Class:
One moment, please.
Oh!
Page 456, please.
Come on, you guys. 456.
Will you shut up and sit down, man?
We told him to take it easy.
It's our fault.
We sit back and watch him burn in.
It's burn out.
He brought it on himself.
He asked for it.
How can you say that?
You're a wanna-be choloasshole, man.
[Spit]
Oh, that's disgusting.
You want me?
I'll kick your ass!
All right, break it up!
Pancho!
Just break it up.
Now, just settle down.
Later.
Settle down, angel.
Now Mr. Escalante is ok.
He suffered a mild heart attack, and he'll be under observation for the time being.
Mr. Schloss is your substitute.
Now, out of respect to Mr. Escalante, please give him your undivided attention.
Now I don't want any more trouble from this room.
All right, pancho, you come with me.
Angel, let's go.
Tito, take your seat.
Mr. Molina has informed me you have your a.p. Calculus exam in 2 weeks.
I'll be honest with you.
I've never taught calculus before.
I'm really a music teacher.
You mad at me, mommy?
If I thought it would help, I would be angry.
Dad... the doctor says no stress.
No job-related activity for at least a month.
I want another doctor.
Jaime, I have to go.
I left Fernando with a neighbor.
I'll stay with dad.
Go with your mother.
Don't forget to take out the trash, ok?
Ok, dad.
Come on, mom.
What time do you get out of work?
Hi!
Hey!
Mr. Escalante!
I'm still alive.
I'm a hard-dying type of guy.
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?
I should be with you.
Bulldogs!
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Thank you very much for baby-sitting.
Have a good day.
How are you?
Hey, you should be taking it easy, man.
No, I should be here with you guys.
I mean, you already forgot to stand up.
Everybody!
No, against the wall like a snake.
Hurry!
We've been practicing for this all year.
You're the best!
You guys are the best!
This is a piece of cake!
Upside-down!
And... step by step!
All right!
You got it now.
Open your eyes.
Y = ln... quantity x - 1.
What's the domain?
X is greater than -1.
No!
To the end of the line.
I'm gone 2 days, and you forget already.
What's the domain?
All real numbers greater than 1.
X is greater than 1.
I told you you could do it.
Ok!
Be sure each mark is black and completely fills the answer space.
If you make an error, you may save time by crossing it out, rather than trying to erase it.
It's not expected that everyone will answer all the multiple-choice questions.
When you're told to begin, open your booklet, tear out the green insert, and start work.
You may begin now.
Let's go!
Come on!
Get in!
Get in!
Oh, no, it's too cold!
Anita!
Come on, anita!
Angel!
I like to keep my pants dry, you know, man?
Angel!
Come on in!
Come on!
The water's great!
Come on!
Ok, fine!
Fine!
This is so stupid, man.
I'm coming!
Angel!
Come on!
Come on!
[Rooster crows]
Orale, grandpa.
We, being teachers, know the advanced placement tests are very difficult, especially in mathematics.
Less than 2% of all high school seniors nationwide even attempt the advanced placement calculus test.
You've been drinking.
I am proud to announce that no other high school in southern California has more students passing than garfield high school.
No.
He just walks like that.
18 students took the test.
18 passed.
Many... we have an announcement to make.
It's all right.
Ok.
We, the a.p. Calculus class, would like to present this plaque to our teacher...
Jaime a.
Escalante.
Come on up.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
[Telephone rings]
Yes?
This is guadalupe escobar.
What is this, some kind of joke?
Wait, wait a minute.
Who is this?
For reals?
What?
You're crazy, man.
"It's standard procedure to grade the test
"with the identity of the students concealed.
"Only after the irregularities were found was it determined the students were all from garfield."
You all received the same letter?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Based upon the unusual agreement of incorrect answers,
"e.t.s. Has no alternative but to question the scores of students with such unusual agreement."
What's it mean in english?
We copied each other because we all had the same wrong answers.
We're too stupid to cheat correctly.
Why don't we just sue?
"The board doubts the grades are valid for you because of these unusual circumstances."
These people are human.
They can make mistakes, too.
Ana:
Kemo, these people are calling us cheaters.
All right.
This is where we keep all confidential material, s.a.t. And a.p. Tests included.
I assure you, only my secretary and i know the combination.
Mr. Molina, this controversy is officially between the educational testing service and the students.
It does not reflect upon your school or its administration.
I understand.
We'd like to resolve this with the least publicity possible.
I'd appreciate that.
All right?
Yep.
Do you think they got the test ahead of time?
Well, claudia was having emotional problems.
Pancho was way behind.
Do you really think anyone cheated?
No, but my father does.
Damn shit!
Look at this shit!
If I'd have taken that job with my uncle,
I could have had a brand-new car by now!
It's ok.
You can fix it.
Come on, ok?
Just relax.
Hey, I didn't know you two were like a thing now.
Just something for the summer.
Come on, lupe.
You're such an asshole, pancho.
Lupe, wait.
Shit!
Lots of stars up there, homey.
Not too polluted.
Stars aren't really there, ese.
No, what you're looking at is where they used to be, man.
It takes the light a thousand years to reach the earth.
For all we know, they burned out long ago, man.
God pulled the plug on us.
He didn't tell nobody.
Those stars are out there.
I don't care what you say.
[Car engine revs]
Hey, homeboy.
Ialli te llevo, mi hija!
Come on, throw me a kiss, baby!
Hey!
Hey, tirame un beso.
[Siren walls]
That's right.
That's right.
That's all you know.
What's the matter, you can't afford a knife?
Use a pencil, go to jail.
Can I have this back now?
You got a tough mouth.
You better watch yourself.
Mucho gusto, officer.
Let's go, Jack.
That was real smart, ese.
Get away from my ride!
Get up.
Come on, get up!
Where are you going?
Come back.
Angel!
Well... does anyone have anything to say?
Ana...
I've known your family for years.
Tell us the truth.
Nothing happened.
Don't lie to me.
Nothing happened!
Just leave her alone.
She didn't do anything wrong.
Then tell us who did.
We're not cops.
We're not here to put anybody behind bars.
If you cheated, let us know so you can go home and enjoy the rest of your summer.
Permiso.
I come from this neighborhood.
Yo vengo de este barrio, and I know that sometimes we're tempted to take short cuts.
Just tell me the truth.
What happened?
Dime la verdad.
Ok.
We're busted.
Why don't we just admit it?
How'd you do it?
I got the test ahead of time and passed it out to everyone.
How did you get it?
The mailman.
I strangled him.
His body's decomposing in my locker.
There's no sense in continuing if they won't cooperate.
Do you know how this got in my box?
A letter of resignation.
Anonymous.
My guess is it could have something to do with the mess this school is in.
You think they cheated?
Mr. Escalante, you put these kids under an awful lot of pressure.
They would have gone to any lengths to please you.
You didn't answer my question.
All right.
Well... every night when I go to bed
I watch the television news.
I see lots of people go on trial.
They deny everything, or their lawyers say they were insane at the time.
A lot of them get off.
But I believe that most people who get caught today are guilty.
Don't you?
Yep.
I know what you mean.
Have you seen my car?
No.
Do you need a ride home?
No, thank you.
Kemo, let me take you home.
[Door closes]
Jaime?
Jaime... want to talk about it?
Mm-mmm.
I may have made a mistake trying to teach them calculus.
Regardless of whether they passed that test or not, Jaime, they learned.
Yeah, they learned if you try real hard, nothing changes.
Quit.
If that's all you have left to teach... quit.
You know, what kills me is that they lost the confidence in the system that they're now finally qualified to be a part of.
I don't know why I'm losing sleep over this.
I don't need it.
I could make twice the money in less hours and have people treat me with respect.
Respect?
Jaime, those kids love you.

Hey, Kemo!
Check out your ride.
We fixed it up for you.
Going downtown, man, to take action on those e.t.s. Boys.
Hey, dad, check out your new car.
Angel:
We got to talk about the payments.
Golly!
Gentlemen?
My name is Jaime Escalante.
I'm the a.p. Calculus teacher from garfield high school.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm dr.
Pearson.
Hello, doctor.
This is dr.
Ramirez.
Que tal?
Un placer.
Es un gusto, senor.
I feel I have the right to know why you think my students cheated.
Mr. Escalante,
I'm sorry you drove out here, but we're not at liberty to discuss the controversy with you.
I'd just like to see the test, that's all.
Mr. Escalante,
I understand what you're going through here.
But I repeat, the problem's between the e.t.s. And the students.
I'd just like to see what mistakes were made.
I'm their teacher.
I know my kids.
Mr. Escalante, have a seat.
No.
No, thank you.
There were some unorthodox, even illogical computations for students of this caliber.
Mistakes in simple math.
Maybe they made the same mistakes because they had the same instruction.
I taught them step by step, all the same way.
Look.
Your students averaged fewer than 4 wrong on the multiple choice, where other schools average what... 14 to 18 incorrect answers?
And most of your kids finished with time to spare.
They should be rewarded, not punished.
Mr. Escalante, the educational testing service does not act capriciously.
Every major university in the united states subscribes to our service.
I would like to see proof of wrongdoing.
I would like to see the tests.
Let me reiterate.
There's no proof of wrongdoing, only a suspicion of cheating.
One is innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.
If you're so confident of your student's abilities, encourage them to retest.
Why should I?
If they don't, everyone will assume they cheated.
Everyone will assume they cheated if they do.
I want to see the tests, please.
Mr. Escalante, we're psychometricians, thorough to the point of boring.
We're not out to get anybody here.
Hold on.
If this was 2 students cheating, that's one thing.
But by making a blanket accusation, you're saying there was a conspiracy.
Every conspiracy has a leader.
Who better to lead it than the teacher?
Nobody's accusing you of anything.
Not only me.
The school, parents, the entire community.
Scores this high would be questioned regardless of the school.
If this was beverly hills high school, you two wouldn't be investigating.
Mr. Escalante,
I hope you're not insinuating that we haven't earned our position here, 'cause no one's given me a damn thing.
You're letting your emotions get the best of you.
If no one's given you a damn thing, you should not be taking away from my kids!
The identity of the students were concealed until it was determined that irregularities existed.
Those scores are only being questioned because my kids have spanish surnames and come from barrio schools!
You know that!
We've been patiently explaining our position and listening to your complaints.
Now our conversation is over.
There's something going on here that nobody's talking about, and you know what it is!
No one has the right to accuse me of racism.
No one has the right to accuse me of racism!
I know well how to spell discrimination!
I thought this was over a long time ago.
Are you doing this to my kids?
There are 2 kinds of racism... singling out members of a minority group andnot singling out members of a minority group.
My kids could teach you a thing or two.
I'm calling security if you can't control yourself.
Go ahead.
You didn't show me the test.
You didn't prove anything.
They didn't do anything.
I'll prove you guys wrong.
I hope you do, because this is not between you and me.
Maybe not, but if I catch you on the street,
I'll kick the shit out of you.
Yeah, this is guadalupe escobar.
I've decided to take the test again.
You're kidding.
Kemo, we only have one day to study.
Ok. 8 a.m. On tuesday.
Thank you.
Why didn't you let me talk to them?
Call collect.
Stick them with a big bill.
I thought I'd seen this place for the last time.
We'll have to review the entire course in one shot.
You mean in one day?
Can't do it in less.
It'll be the same test?
Mm-mmm.
It'll be harder.
Don't count on that.
Just go step by step and play defense.
Don't bring anything.
No pencils, no erasers, nothing.
Don't wear clothes with too many pockets.
Don't let your eyes wander.
No spacing out.
Don't give them any opportunity to call you cheaters.
You are the true dreamers, and dreams accomplish wonderful things.
You're the best.
Tomorrow you'll prove that you're the champs.
Start with chapter one.
Kemo, what you making over there?
You like brains?
Good.
I was afraid you guys wouldn't appreciate it.
This food lasts for 24 hours.
You're afraid we'll screw up royally tomorrow, aren't you?
Tomorrow's just another day, honey.
I'm afraid you'll screw up the rest of your lives.
I'm fried.
I don't care if I don't pass.
Sit down.
We got work to do.
I'm going home.
Sit down.
I'm tired, and I'm going home.
Ok?
You know what you're doing?
I'm going home.
That's what I'm doing.
This stuff's ready.
Who'd like some?
Kemo, let's order out, man.
I was just kidding.
Hey, I had to see you.
You can't expect me to be your girlfriend at your convenience.
I'm an asshole.
Sorry.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the procedure.
You have 90 minutes to complete the multiple-choice section.
Do not fill in answers by guessing.
Wrong answers will be counted against you.
You may begin part one... now.
Ok.
Pencils down.
You have 90 minutes to complete the free response section.
Don't spend too much time on any particular answer.
Credit will be issued for partial solutions.
Open the booklet.
Begin part 2.
Good luck.
Finished?
I cannot finish the test.
I have an appointment at usc.
It's related to my scholarship.
Can't that wait?
No, it can't.
Ok.
Did you fill out your I.D. Card?
Yes.
Thank you.
Ok... pencils down.
Mr. Escalante?
Mr. Escalante, did you hear the news?
We got the computers.
Yep.
That'll do it.
Jaime, they want to go over the test again, make sure there's no misunderstandings.
Estelle, I'm going to the faculty meeting.
Thank you.
Misunderstanding again?
Can you call dr.
Ramirez?
He'll help us.
He's going to tell me the same thing, Jaime.
All right.
I'll call him.
Icaray!
This is Mr. Molina calling again.
Yes, I did.
Oh, you do?
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that very much.
Uh... uh...
one moment.
Yes, uh, yes.
I'm aware of the scoring.
3 is a passing grade.
5 is a perfect grade.
Yes.
I'm ready.
Go ahead.
Diaz, maria. 4.
Sinfuentes, mark. 5.
Navarra, jose. 4.
I want the original scores reinstated.
Santos, Daniel. 4.
Escobar, Guadalupe. 5.
Camejo, Claudia. 4.
Ana Delgado. 4.
Garcia, Francisco. 3.
Fuentes, Rafaela. 4.
Javier Perales. 5.

Estelle, hold the meeting.
We're coming with great news.
Pernajas, Juliana. 5.
Hernandez, Alejandro. 4.
Castro, Monica. 4.

Some people hate and expect perfection?

Some people lie and demand the truth?

Gotta ask myself if it's all deception?

Is this a natural thing?

That we all just do?

We take such pleasure from pain?

I'm just tired of playing that game?

Every time I get a little bit of satisfaction?

The key to the ladies room.
Where was the fecal material found?
In the corner.
You'll know when you're near it.
- This was mailed to me.
- Just a minute.
If you don't have a telephone, bring in a gas bill.
We need proof that you live in the district.
I'm Jaime Escalante.
I'm supposed to teach Computer Science.
We don't have computers.
We were supposed to get computers, but there's no funding for them again.
I'm Raquel Ortega, chairman of the math department.
We'll be working together.
You don't understand.
I was supposed to teach computers.
- Where were you last night?
- Where was I?
"Where was I?" I was waiting.
You the new teacher?
Please find a seat.
What are we doing today?
Will everyone please try to find a seat?
If you can't find a seat stand against the wall.
Let's put our desks in a circle and discuss our feelings.
One body to a desk.
Could we talk about sex?
Then I'd have to give sex for homework.
Stand back everybody, please.
I can get you fired for saying that.
What'd he say?
¿Entienden inglés?
Sometimes.
Please move forward if you do not speak English.
All the first row, stand up.
Move out.
I was the first one here.
I'll find you another seat, okay?
Be careful.
This is Math 1-A.
I don't need math.
I got a solar calculator with my dozen doughnuts.
The bus is exact change.
No big deal.
Quiet!
Everyone back in the classroom!
Everyone back in the class!
It was a premature bell.
Back in the class.
That was a premature bell.
Premature bell?
We're not supposed to discuss sex in class.
Sit down!
Stop talking!
They rigged the bell.
Those little bastards.
She's looking good, Joe.
When are you coming aboard?
I get seasick in the rain.
- Have you seen my boy?
- He was riding around here somewhere.
I hear your company's pushing whole hog into PCs.
I don't work there anymore.
Jaime's teaching high school now.
Here's your thingy.
If you got laid off, why didn't you come to me?
We pay kids right out of college $30,000.
I didn't get laid off.
I want to teach.
High school teacher.
Well, good.
That's great.
This is your job.
I was going to do it.
Why do you think I hurried home?
You're not even breathing hard, you're hurrying so fast.
Have a good night, Joe.
I want a burger, hold the French fries, the onions, and the pickles!
You look like Julia Child.
What you got?
It's an apple.
How much?
What do you mean?
What have you got?
Half.
Good.
Excuse my German accent.
What have you got?
Missing 25 percent.
- What?
- It's missing 25 percent.
That's right.
Missing 25 percent.
Is it true intelligent people make better lovers?
What you got?
I got a core.
You owe me 100 percent.
I'll see you in The People's Court.
Everyone please open your books, Chapter 2, Page 26.
Multiplication of fractions and percentages.
25 percent 50 percent 75 percent and 100 percent.
Who's calling the shots, ese?
Have you got a slip?
You got a slip?
You'll have to stand in the back until I can get another desk.
You sit right here.
Everyone please read the first paragraph for a second.
- Where's your equipment?
- Don't got any.
Got to come to this class prepared.
Do the work in my head.
You know the times tables?
I know the one's two's three's.
Finger Man.
I heard about you.
Are you the Finger Man?
I'm the Finger Man, too.
Do you know what I can do?
I know how to multiply by nine.
9 x 3.
One, two, three.
What do you get?
27!
6 x 9.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
What do you get?
54!
Do you want a hard one?
How about 8 x 9?
What have you got?
72.
Wait a minute.
Please make sure you do problems 1 through 20.
Page 26.
Can I have my book, Mr. Escalante?
Don't bring it to class again.
Don't get excited.
Cut me a D like the other profes.
I'll read my funny books count the holes in the ceiling kick back.
First thing, I can teach you some manners.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Lose a finger, I can't count to ten.
We've seen vatos like you before.
You'll be hurting soon.
Ponte trucha.
I was so worried the kids would know more than me, I'd wake at 5:00 a.
M down my coffee and hit the math text.
I finally get every chapter down and now they change the book on me.
Math, you either love or hate.
You got problems, come see me.
Thanks, Jaime.
See you later.
You're in love?
Which one?
Let me know.
No, that's all right.
- Come on, Johnny, don't be afraid.
- I'm not "Johnny."
I know, Tito.
Tito Grande.
Angel!
Go get a teacher!
It's Frank Garcia.
When I say García, you answer, okay?
Are your friends auditing?
I audited them to come with me.
I'm El Ciclón from Bolivia.
One-man gang.
This is my domain.
Don't give me no gas.
I'll jump on your face, tattoo your chromosomes.
This is basic math, but basic math is too easy for you.
So I'll teach you algebra, because I'm the champ.
If the only thing you can do is add and subtract you'll be able to do one thing:
Pump gas.
Ripping off a gas station is better than working in one.
I'm a tough guy.
Tough guys don't do math, tough guys deep fry chicken for a living.
You want a wing or a leg?
Who ever heard of negative and positive numbers?
Negative numbers are like unemployment.
Ten million people out of work, that's a negative number.
We'll need lots of Kleenex 'cause there's gonna be bloodshed.
Have you ever been to the beach?
Have you ever played with the sand?
Finger Man!
You ever dig a hole?
The sand that comes out of the hole, that's a positive.
The hole is a negative.
That's it.
Simple.
Anybody can do it.
- 2 + 2 =...
Net Head?
Answer it.
Come on, you know the answer.
- 2 + 2.
Fill the hole.
If I had that on my hand, I wouldn't raise it, either.
- 2 + 2 =...
Anybody can do it.
Fill the hole.
- 2 + 2 =...
Just fill the hole.
You can do it.
Don't let these burros laugh at you.
- 2 + 2 =...
I'll break your neck like a toothpick.
0.
0?
You're right.
Simple.
That's it.
- 2 + 2 = 0.
He just filled the hole.
Neither the Greeks nor the Romans were capable of using the concept of zero.
It was your ancestors the Mayas, who first contemplated the zero.
The absence of value.
True story.
You burros have math in your blood.
Kimo sabe todo.
The man knows everything!
Parenthesis means multiply.
Every time you see this, multiply.
A negative times a negative equals a positive.
"A negative times a negative equals a positive." Say it.
"A negative times a negative equals a positive." Say it!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
Again!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
I can't hear you.
"A negative times a negative equals a positive."
Louder!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive!"
Louder!
"A negative times a negative equals a positive!"
Why?
My point is I don't want to be the principal of the first school in the history of Los Angeles to lose its accreditation.
I'm the last person to say that this math department couldn't improve.
But if you want higher test scores start by changing the economic level of this community.
The purpose of this meeting is to review the recommendations for accreditation.
Any suggestions?
I don't think I should be teaching math next semester.
I was hired to be phys.
Ed.
Instructor.
As I said before we lack the resources to implement the changes the district demands.
Mr. Sanzaki, you must have at least one comment.
This may not be the right time to say this, but I'm sorry, but I won't be coming back after Christmas.
I got a job with aerospace.
How much money?
We have the remainder of the year before we're put on probation.
- If we fail, we lose accreditation.
- If we fail?
You can't teach logarithms to illiterates.
These kids come to us with barely a 7th grade education.
There isn't a teacher in this room who isn't doing everything he possibly can.
I'm not.
I could teach more.
I'm sure Mr. Escalante has good intentions but he's only been here a few months.
Students will rise to the level of expectations, Señor Molina.
What do you need, Mr. Escalante?
Ganas.
All we need is ganas.
What's ganas?
We will begin each class with a quiz.
There will be no free rides, no excuses.
You already have two strikes against you.
There are some people in this world who assume that you know less than you do because of your name and your complexion but math is the great equalizer.
When you go for a job, the employer will not want to hear your problems.
Neither do I.
You'll work harder than you ever worked before.
And the only thing I ask from you is ganas desire... a haircut.
If you don't have the ganas, I will give it to you because I am an expert.
Today is Monday, tomorrow is Wednesday Friday is payday, the weekly test.
There will be no diagonal vision.
Keep your eyes on your own paper.
You have 10 minutes to finish.
If you finish early, start the assignment on the board.
No questions?
Good.
¡Angel, vámonos!
I was said to go here.
Nice knowing you.
Have a good day.
Arrivederci!
You're in luck.
Take the seat.
Relax, take Sominex.
Don't sleep in my class.
I take that as an insult.
Kimo, I want to talk to you about the class.
You ain't got a seat.
Don't give me no gas.
I know about that.
It was a mistake.
I'm gonna fly straight, but I got a problem.
Yeah, me.
Seriously.
Books.
The homies can't see me haul them around.
You don't want anyone to think you're intelligent.
Maybe I can have two books, keep one stashed at home.
I'll cut you a deal.
I'll give you three books.
Take one home.
One for your class.
This one is broken.
One for your locker, so nobody sees you carrying it around.
Easily understood?
What do I get?
Protection, Kimo.
Protección, understand?
I understand.
I understand.
That's the only reason I'm still in Kimo's class.
Don't tell her that you dig her.
That's the worst thing you can do with a woman.
I'm fed up with this pelón we got for a teacher.
Escalante has a bug up his ass.
He's from South America.
He's probably a Nazi come out of hiding.
Don't you know?
Garfield can't get accredited.
Only teachers who act like assholes will keep their jobs.
What if we all decide not to take this test?
He can't fail the whole class.
Mutiny.
That's cool.
See you guys later.
Camejo thinks she's hot because she dates gabachos.
If we don't do better today, heads will roll.
I've never gotten lower than a B+ in my life.
Because you take those Mickey Mouse classes.
Always get an A. Here you have a chance for a solid D.
You got 10 minutes.
Here he comes.
Watch this.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not taking the quiz.
You didn't turn in your homework.
My goat ate it.
You don't do your homework, you don't get a ticket to watch the show.
Give her the chair!
Shit.
Chair!
Chair!
Chair!
Shut up!
Get back to your tests.
You've got less than nine minutes.
Now you're the show.
What's the matter with you?
Are you the dumb student?
Come on!
3:00.
You'll have to do it anyway.
Kids go to bed?
Papa go to work?
Can I fix you something to eat?
Mija, could you please turn off that light?
Orale, homeboy.
Teacher time, ese.
Tell Kimo I say, "¿Qué hubo?", ese.
Oh, shit man!
Green light, red light?
Anybody?
Late!
Late, Angel!
- Go see the counselor.
- Come on, Kimo.
Go to wood shop, make a shoeshine box.
You'll need it.
You're the man, you know.
Why don't you put them in college, huh?
So dumb taco benders like me can pick their vegetables collect their garbage clip their poodle's toenails.
I may be a sinner but I'm willing to pay for my sins.
One-shot deal.
Go sit down.
See you at 3:00.
Go to hell.
I got more bad news for you.
What I'm going to say will trip you out.
Mr. Escalante, I forgot my pencil.
He can have mine.
Today is my last day.
Did you enjoy your taquitos?
Except for one thing.
Someone doesn't know how to add.
She should be back in school.
Papa, this is Mr. Escalante, my math teacher.
Can you sit with us?
Anita, bring us a couple of beers.
You should get another waitress.
Ana can be the first in your family to graduate and go to college.
I thank you for your concern.
Her mother, sisters, and brothers work here.
This is a family business.
She is needed.
She could help the family more by getting an education.
She'd probably get pregnant.
She wouldn't finish college.
Anita, go help your mom in the kitchen.
She talks about going to medical school.
I don't think so.
She should make her own choices.
She'll just get fat.
She'll waste her life here.
She's a top kid!
I started washing dishes for a nickel an hour.
Now I own this place.
Did I waste my life?
I washed dishes too when I came to America.
Good!
Put on an apron and give us a hand.
Your husband comes to my restaurant, eats then insults me.
Excuse my husband, Mr. Delgado.
He just wants what's best for Ana.
She could go to college, then teach you how to run the place.
Professor?
I don't want your money and I don't need your business.
Skip it.
Tip.
He puts hot chili in his dip to sell extra beer.
Dog, dog, dog, dog!
Everybody look at the board.
Will someone please read for me what's on the board?
Anybody.
Juan has five times as many girlfriends as Pedro.
Carlos has one girlfriend less than Pedro.
If their total number of girlfriends is 20 how many does each gigolo have?
Late!
Late!
Late!
Late!
How many girlfriends does each gigolo have?
Anybody.
You think you got it, Einstein?
Juan is x.
Carlos is y.
Pedro is x + y.
Is Pedro bisexual, or what?
I have a terrible feeling about you.
5x = Juan's girlfriends.
You're good now but you'll end up barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen.
Can you get negative girlfriends?
No, just negative boyfriends.
Please forgive them, for they know not what they do!
Carlos has x - 5 girlfriends, ¿qué no?
"Que no" is right.
Que no.
The answer to my prayers!
May I go to the restroom?
In 10 minutes.
Hold it.
Hit it.
It's a trick problem, Mr. Kimo.
You need to know how many girlfriends they have in common.
It's not that they're stupid.
They just don't know anything.
I'm wrong?
X = Pedro's girlfriends.
5x = Juan's girlfriends.
X - 1 = Carlos's girlfriends.
(x + 5x) + (x -1) = 20.
So, x = 3.
Good to see you.
This makes no sense unless we see how it works in the real world.
Could I get a couple of gigolos for a practical demonstration?
No, no.
Just kidding.
What kind of math is this?
The one that's up right now is calculus.
You'll get it in college.
My daughter uses this program in her high school.
I want to teach calculus next year.
Boy, that's a jump.
That's ridiculous.
They haven't had trig or math analysis.
They can take them this summer.
Our best students in summer school?
From 7:00 to 12:00.
Every day, including Saturdays.
That would do it.
Summer classrooms are reserved for remedial courses.
To turn this school around, start from the top.
Mr. Escalante, don't lecture us.
Our kids can't handle calculus.
We don't even have the books.
If they pass the Advanced Placement Test, they get college credit.
There are some teachers here who couldn't pass the Advanced Placement Test.
You think you can make this fly?
I teach calculus or have a good day.
If this man can walk in here and dictate his own terms, over my objections I see no reason to continue as department chair.
Don't take this personally.
I'm thinking about those kids.
If they try and don't succeed you'll shatter what little self-confidence they have.
These aren't the types that bounce back.
Have a good day.
Kimo, it stinks like last year in here.
Somebody give Claudia an orange.
Okay, okay!
Sit down!
You think I want to do this?
The Japanese pay me.
They're tired of making everything.
They want you to pull your own weight so they can go take vacations on Mount Fuji.
Kimo, I thought this room was supposed to be air-conditioned.
You should think cool.
Think...
Cool.
Think...
Cool.
Cool!
I get this letter saying I'm fired because of Proposition 13.
I'm down to $936.
I invest $100 in resumes and buy this suit.
I hit every insurance company in the city.
My wife wants us to move into her parents' rec room.
Two weeks later I get another letter telling me to go back to work.
How do you like the suit?
- Fabulous.
- How about the color?
Welcome back, pelón!
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Sure?
Yes!
I said I was fine.
We will go step by step, inch by inch.
Calculus was not made to be easy.
It already is.
Remember the good times we had last summer?
Remember when things were really jumping good?
That's Gone With tAhe Wind.
Now it's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
Come on, a contract?
You mean you can't trust us by now?
Those of you who commit will be preparing for the advanced Placement Test.
Have this signed before class tomorrow.
We come in an hour early, take your class two periods and stay until 5:00?
Believe it or don't.
We have to come on Saturdays?
And no vacations?
Pass the A.P. And you get college credit.
- Big deal.
- We're seniors.
We get to slack off.
Can you make it Saturday morning after playing in your band Friday nights?
I know you love scaring us into doing stuff.
But that gets old real fast.
Hey, Kimo.
You proud of me?
I'm the first dude here!
What's calculus?
Calculus is math that Sir Isaac Newton invented to figure out planet orbits.
But he never told anybody about it until this other scientist claimed he had invented calculus.
But the guy was so stupid he got it all wrong so Newton went public to fix his mistakes.
Isn't that neat?
For a genius, Newton was an idiot.
If I invent something, I'll make sure to get paid.
I hope this isn't an excuse to stay out all hours.
Trust me, Mom.
Sign it.
Boys don't like it if you're smart.
I'm doing this so I don't have to depend on some dumb guy for the rest of my life.
Thank you.
You don't have it signed, you don't have a ticket to watch the show.
Thank you, Mr. Kung Fu.
Mr. Blue Eyes, thank you.
Elizabeth, my Taylor!
Sophia, my Loren.
Get a haircut.
How many times I got to tell you?
Red, get a new jacket.
Clint, forget your gun?
Unfold it.
Hey, you didn't...
Get out of the way.
- You didn't sign it.
- I'm putting school on hold.
Go back until you sign it.
My uncle offered me a job operating a forklift weekends.
So what?
Two years in the union and I'll make more than you.
The money I'll be making will buy me a new Trans Am.
Wouldn't you rather be designing these than repairing them?
You can't even do that.
They got fuel injection.
- You're going to strip my gears.
- What's the problem?
Don't panic, Johnny.
Just watch out for the other guy.
- Right or left?
- Where are we going?
- Right or left!
- Go right!
All you see is the turn.
You don't see the road ahead.
Open the gate.
We're going to be late.
Why are you here so early?
We're going to Mr. Escalante's class.
Wake up.
Drink some coffee.
One, you got the graph right here.
Two, this is the most important part.
Right here.
The radius of rotation.
That's it.
Anybody got any questions?
Anybody can do it if you remember one basic element:
The element of surprise.
Stay awake!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Bring toothpicks to pinch open your eyes.
Do you understand, Johnny?
I was swimming with dolphins, whispering imaginary numbers looking for the fourth dimension.
Go back to sleep.
That's very good.
Any questions?
Yes?
No?
Nothing?
Okay.
You should have it by now.
What's the answer?
Anybody?
We're going backwards.
You're fooling around too much on the weekend.
This girl's got to do some work from the neck up.
We'll have to stay late again.
We can have pizza delivered.
We can get fried chicken, cheeseburgers.
Donations?
You owe me money.
You don't deserve the grades you get.
Are you late for another date?
She has more boyfriends than Elizabeth Taylor!
I don't appreciate you using my personal life to entertain this class.
Everything is falling apart.
My boyfriend is freaking out!
School sucks.
I'm in that classroom all day, Kimo.
Look at my clothes and my hair.
I can't even comb it.
I hate my life.
So what's the problem?
You're going to have to bring him in.
I'm not a doctor, Ma'am.
There's no way.
I don't do diagnosis.
Are we going to see the doctor before next week?
Hold on. ¿Seguro?
Medi-Cal?
How are you going to pay for this?
If we could pay for it, we'd go to a regular hospital.
My grandmother will get pneumonia waiting.
Take a seat and we'll call your number.
You have to bring him in.
There's no way around it.
I understand that, but you have to bring him in.
Try the shortcut.
This is easy.
Baby stuff for Boy Scouts.
My mind don't work this way.
Tic-tac-toe.
It's a piece of cake, upside down.
Watch for the green light.
I've been with you guys for two years!
Everyone knows I'm the dumbest!
I can't handle calculus!
They have a better chance on the A.P. Test without me.
Don't laugh!
Laugh!
You're breaking our hearts.
Don't do this.
He'll sacrifice himself to benefit the team.
Do you have the ganas!
I have the ganas.
- You want me to do it for you?
- Yes!
You're supposed to say no!
I'm going to have to get tough.
We'll have to work right through Christmas break.
The counselor was just here looking for you.
Something about cosmetology classes.
He says, there's three different levels.
One for boys, one for girls and one for I don't know what.
Go find out.
Kimo, listen.
It's cool.
- My grandmother...
- Clock out.
Game's over.
You lose.
You never listen to nobody, man!
Adiós.
Why don't you send me some postcards?
Or call me on the phone, let me know how you're doing?
We love you.
Kimo Sabe this, cabrón!
Pancho, that guy has a bigger problem than you.
Tic-tac-toe.
Simple.
No.
She's a little sloppy with her homework.
Dad, get off the phone so we can eat.
No, she's a top student.
You're father works 60 hours a week, then volunteers to teach night school.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Now he's visiting junior high schools in his spare time.
Corn and potatoes?
What happened to the lomo montado pica a lo macho?
Jaime, I don't want you to teach this holiday.
No teaching.
I don't understand this problem.
His own son has problems with math.
Give me that book.
- No books at the table.
- Go wash your hands.
I'll get it.
You see what I mean?
I've seen you do a lot of underhanded tricks but bringing your abuelita to my house at Christmastime, come on.
I need calculus to take me to a good career, Johnny.
Something smells good.
"On the first day of Christmas A cholo came to me"
This is what's given.
We're looking for the area in the first quadrant bounded by the curve.
What are the limits?
Anybody.
0 to pi/2, sir.
Wrong.
Lupe.
0 to pi/2?
What is wrong with you?
This is review.
I checked my work twice.
Check it again.
I got the same answer as the gordita.
Don't call me gordita, pendejo.
It's 0 to pi/2, sir.
Yeah, I got the same thing.
You should know this!
What is wrong with you?
This is review!
You act like a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there!
I don't believe it.
It's giving me a shot from the back!
No way!
Kimo finally blew a head gasket.
It's a pen.
It's a pencil.
It's a chair.
It's a light.
It's a window.
It's in the room, on the table.
It's 10:00.
Un momento, por favor.
One moment, please.
Page 456, please.
Come on, Page 456.
Shut up and sit down.
We told him to take it easy.
It's our fault.
We sit back and watch him burn in.
It's "burn out."
The man brought it on himself.
He was asking for trouble.
How can you say that?
You wanna-be cholo asshole.
That's disgusting!
You want me?
I'll kick your ass!
It's Molina!
Break it up!
Pancho, just break it up.
Settle down.
- Later, dude.
- Settle down, Angel.
Mr. Escalante is okay.
He had a mild heart attack and he's under observation.
Mr. Schloss is your substitute.
Out of respect to Mr. Escalante, please give him your undivided attention.
I don't want any more trouble from this room.
Pancho, you come with me.
Angel, let's go.
Tito, take your seat.
Mr. Molina has informed me that you have your A.P. Calculus exam in two weeks.
To be honest, I've never taught calculus.
I'm really a music teacher.
Are you mad at me, Mommy?
If I thought it would help, I would be angry.
The doctor says no stress.
No job-related activity for at least a month.
I want another doctor.
I have to go.
I left Fernando with a neighbor.
- I'll stay with Dad.
- No, go with your mother.
Don't forget to take out the trash.
What time do you get off work?
I'm still alive!
I'm a hard-dying guy.
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?
No, I should be here with you.
Bulldogs!
Dog, dog, dog, dog.
Thank you for baby-sitting my canguros.
Have a good day.
How are you?
You should take it easy.
Go back to bed, man.
No, I should be here with you.
You already forgot to stand up!
Everybody!
No, against the wall like a snake!
Hurry!
We've practiced for this all year.
You're the best!
You guys are the best!
This will be a piece of cake!
Upside down.
And...
Step by step.
You got it now.
Open your eyes.
Y = In (x - 1).
What is the domain?
X - 1.
No!
End of the line!
I'm gone two days and you forget.
What's the domain?
All real numbers greater than one.
X 1.
I told you, you could do it.
Okay!
Be sure each mark is black and completely filled-in.
If you make an error save time by crossing it out instead of erasing.
It is not expected that you will answer all multiple choice questions.
When you're told to begin, open your booklet.
Tear out the green insert and start work.
You may begin.
Let's go!
I like to keep my pants dry.
The water is great!
Come on!
Okay, fine!
This is so stupid!
I'm coming!
Orale, Grandpa!
We, being teachers know the Advanced Placement Tests are very difficult especially in mathematics.
Less than two percent of all high school seniors nationwide even attempt the Advanced Placement Calculus Test.
You've been drinking!
I am proud to announce that no other high school in Southern California has more students passing than Garfield High School.
No, he just walks like that.
Eighteen students took the test.
Eighteen passed.
We have an announcement to make.
We, the A.P. Calculus Class would like to present this plaque to our teacher Jaime A. Escalante.
Yes, this is Guadalupe Escobar.
Is this some kind of joke?
Who is this?
For real?
What?
You're crazy, man.
"Tests are graded with the identity of the student concealed.
"Only after irregularities were found was it determined...
"...that all the students were from Garfield High." You all got this?
"Based upon the unusual agreement of incorrect answers...
"...
E.T.S. Must question the scores...
"...of all students with such unusual agreement."
What does it mean in English?
They think we cheated because we all had the same wrong answers.
We're too stupid to know how to cheat correctly.
Let's sue them.
"The board doubts the grades are valid because of these unusual circumstances."
These people are human.
They can make mistakes.
Kimo, these people are calling us cheaters.
This is where we keep all confidential material S.A.T. And A.P. Tests included.
Only my secretary and I know the combination.
This controversy is officially between the E.T.S. And the students.
It does not reflect upon your school or its administration.
We'd like to resolve this with as little publicity as possible.
I'd appreciate that.
You think they got the test ahead of time?
Claudia was having emotional problems.
Pancho was way behind.
Do you really think anyone cheated?
No.
But my father does.
Damn shit!
Look at this shit!
If I'd taken that job with my uncle, I'd have a new car by now!
It's all right.
You can fix it.
You can fix it.
Just relax.
I didn't know you two were a thing now.
Just something for the summer.
You're an asshole, Pancho.
Shit!
Lots of stars up there, homey.
Not too polluted.
The stars aren't really there, ese.
What you're looking at is where they used to be.
It takes the light 1,000 years to reach the earth.
For all we know, they burned out a long time ago.
God pulled the plug on us.
He didn't tell nobody.
The stars are out there, homeboy.
I don't care what you say.
Hey, homeboy!
Throw me a kiss, baby!
That's right!
That's all you know.
Can't you afford a knife?
Use a pencil, go to jail.
You've got a tough mouth.
You better watch yourself.
Mucho gusto, officer.
That was real smart, ese!
Get away from my ride!
Get up!
Get up!
Where are you going?
Come back!
Well, does anyone have anything to say?
I've known your family for years.
Tell us the truth.
Nothing happened.
- Don't lie to me.
- Nothing happened!
Leave her alone.
She didn't do anything wrong.
Then tell us who did.
We're not cops.
We're not here to put anybody behind bars.
If you cheated, let us know so you can go home and enjoy the rest of your summer.
I come from this neighborhood.
I know that sometimes we're tempted to take shortcuts.
Tell me the truth.
What happened?
We're busted.
Let's admit it.
How did you do it?
I got the test ahead of time and passed it out.
How did you get it?
The mailman.
I strangled him.
His body's decomposing in my locker.
No sense in continuing if they won't cooperate.
Do you know how this got in my box?
A letter of resignation.
Anonymous.
My guess is that it has something to do with the mess this school is in.
Do you think the students cheated?
Mr. Escalante, you put these kids under an awful lot of pressure.
They would have gone to any lengths to please you.
You didn't answer my question.
Every night I watch the news on Tv.
I see a lot of people go on trial.
They deny everything or their lawyers say they were insane when they did it.
A lot of them get off.
But I believe most people who get caught today are guilty don't you?
Yep, I know what you mean.
Have you seen my car?
Do you need a ride home?
No, thank you!
Kimo, let me take you home!
Want to talk about it?
I may have made a mistake trying to teach them calculus.
Regardless of whether they passed that test or not they learned.
They learned if you try real hard, nothing changes.
Quit.
If that's all you have left to teach quit.
What kills me is that they lost the confidence in the system they are now finally qualified to be a part of.
I don't know why I'm losing sleep over this.
I don't need it.
I could make twice the money and less hours and have people treat me with respect.
Respect?
Jaime, those kids love you.
Hey, Kimo!
Check out your ride!
We fixed it up for you.
It's going downtown to take action on those E.T.S. Boys.
Dad, check out your new car!
We got to talk about the payments, though.
I'm Jaime Escalante.
I'm the A.P. Calculus teacher from Garfield High.
I'm Dr. Pearson and this is Dr. Ramirez.
I feel I have a right to know why you think my students cheated.
I'm sorry you drove all the way out here but we're not at liberty to discuss the controversy.
I'd just like to see the test, that's all.
I understand what you're going through but the problem is between the E.T.S. And the students.
I'd just like to see what kind of mistakes were made.
I'm their teacher.
I know my kids.
Mr. Escalante, have a seat.
No, thank you.
There were some unorthodox, even illogical, computations for students of this caliber.
Mistakes in simple math.
Because they have the same teacher teaching them the same program.
I taught them step by step, all the same way.
Your students averaged fewer than four wrong on the multiple choice where other schools average 14 to 18 incorrect answers.
Most of your kids finished with time to spare.
They should be rewarded, not punished.
The Educational Testing Service does not act capriciously.
Every major university in the US subscribes to our service.
I'd just like to see proof of wrongdoing.
I'd like to see the tests.
There is no proof of wrongdoing, only a suspicion of cheating.
In this country one is innocent until proven guilty.
Not vice versa.
If you are so confident of their abilities, encourage them to retest.
Why?
If they don't, everyone will assume they cheated.
Everyone will assume they cheated if they do.
I want to see the test!
Mr. Escalante, we are psychometricians, thorough to the point of boring.
We're not out to get anyone.
Wait.
A situation of two students cheating is one thing.
This blanket accusation is saying there was a conspiracy.
Every conspiracy has a leader.
Who better qualify to be the leader than the teacher?
Nobody is accusing you here of anything.
Not only me, the school, the parents, the entire community!
Scores this high would be questioned regardless of the school.
But if this was Beverly Hills High they wouldn't have sent you to investigate.
I hope you're not insinuating that we haven't earned our position here.
No one has given me a damn thing.
You are letting your emotions get the best of you.
If no one gave you a damn thing, you shouldn't take away from my kids!
The identity of the students was concealed until it was determined that irregularities existed.
No one would have questioned the scores if my kids didn't have Spanish surnames and come from barrio schools!
All right.
We've explained our position and heard your complaints, but now our conversation is over.
Something is going on that nobody is talking about.
And you know what it is!
No one has the right to accuse me of racism.
No one has that right!
I know well how to spell discrimination!
I thought this was over long ago.
Why do this to my kids?
There are two kinds of racism, Mr. Escalante.
Singling out a group who are members of a minority and not singling out a group who are members of a minority.
My kids could teach you a thing or two, Johnny!
I'll call security if you can't control yourself.
Do it!
You didn't prove anything.
My kids didn't do anything!
I'll prove you guys wrong.
I hope you do because this is not between you and me.
Maybe not.
But if I catch you on the street, I'll kick the shit out of you.
This is Guadalupe Escobar.
I'm going to take the test again.
You're kidding!
Kimo, we only have one day to study.
8:00 a.m. On Tuesday.
Thank you.
You didn't let me talk to them.
Call collect.
Stick them with a big bill.
Thought I'd seen this place for the last time.
We'll have to review the whole course in one shot.
- In one day?
- Can't do it in any less.
Maybe they'll give us the same test.
It will be harder.
You can count on that.
Just go step by step and play defense.
Don't bring anything.
No pencils, no erasers, nothing.
Don't wear clothes with too many pockets.
Don't let your eyes wander.
No spacing out.
Don't give them any opportunity to call you cheaters.
You are the true dreamers.
And dreams accomplish wonderful things.
You're the best.
Tomorrow you'll prove that you're the champs.
Start with Chapter 1.
Kimo, what you making there?
You like brains?
Good.
I was afraid you guys wouldn't appreciate it.
This food lasts for 24-hours.
You're afraid we're going to screw up royally tomorrow.
Tomorrow is just another day.
I'm afraid you'll screw up the rest of your lives.
I'm fried.
I don't care if I don't pass that test.
- Sit down.
We got a lot of work to do.
- I'm going home.
Sit down.
I'm tired and I'm going home.
Okay?
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I'm going home, that's what.
It's almost ready.
Who wants some?
Let's order out, man.
Just kidding.
I had to see you.
You can't expect me to be your girlfriend at your convenience.
I'm an asshole.
Sorry.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the procedure.
You have 90 minutes to complete the multiple choice section.
Do not fill in answers by guessing.
Wrong answers will be counted against you.
You may begin Part 1, now.
Okay, pencils down.
You have 90 minutes to complete the free-response section.
Do not spend too much time on any particular answer.
Credit will be issued for partial solutions.
Open the booklet, begin Part 2.
Good luck.
- Finished?
- No, I can't finish the test.
I have a scholarship appointment at U.S.C.
- Can't that wait?
- No, it can't.
Did you fill out your ID card?
Okay, pencils down.
Did you hear the news?
We got the computers.
Yep, that'll do it.
They want to go over the test again so that there's no misunderstandings.
I'm on my way to the faculty meeting.
Misunderstanding again?
Call Dr. Ramirez.
He'll help us.
He'll tell me the same thing.
All right, I'll call him.
This is Mr. Molina calling again.
Can I speak to...
Yes, I did.
You do?
Yes!
I'd like that very much.
One moment.
Yes, I'm aware of the scoring.
Three is a passing grade, five is a perfect grade.
I'm ready.
Go ahead.
Diaz, Maria, four.
Sinfuentes, Mark, five.
Narvarra, Jose, four.
I want the original scores reinstated.
Santos, Daniel, four.
Escobar, Guadalupe, five.
Camejo, Claudia, four.
Ana Delgado, four.
Garcia, Francisco, three.
Fuentes, Rafaela, four.
Javier Perales, five.
Guitaro, Armando, four.
Angel Guzman five.
Tell them to hold the meeting.
We have great news.
Pernajas, Juliana, five.
Hernandez, Alejandro, four.
Castro, Monica, four.
Done by (c) dcd / November 2008
And so today you are full-fledged ensigns.
Three short months ago you assembled here from all walks of life:
field, factory, office and college campus.
You knew what the fighting was about, or you wouldn't have volunteered.
Each of you knew that the American way of life... must be defended by life itself.
From here on... your education must continue in the more demanding school of actual war.
Wearing the gold stripe of ensign in the United States Navy... you go down to the sea to fight... in the toughest conflict of all time.
Your fellow Americans share my confidence... that you'll serve the navy and the country... with honor and distinction.
Good luck, and good hunting.
Willie!
Over here!
-Darling, I'm so proud of you!
-Thanks, Mother.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, Uncle Lloyd.
Your mother will tell me if the navy doesn't make use of your abilities.
With the proper approach, I could help you be placed somewhere else.
-Good luck in the meantime.
-Thank you.
I'm afraid I'll have to skip your party tonight.
Some of the fellows are having a celebration--
But the party's in your honor.
-Besides, we have so few days left--
-But Mother.
Your friends will forgive you.
You can call them from the house.
I'll see you at 10:00.
your eyes of blue your kisses too
I never knew
Whaf f hey could do
I can' believe that you're in love with me you're felling everyone I know
I'm on your mind each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me
I have always placed you
Far above me
I just can' imagine
Thaf you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that I'm the lucky one
I can' believe that you're in love
Wifh me
May!
You were wonderful.
Thanks.
I'm surprised your mother let you out.
I had to be with her.
I should have told you yesterday I couldn't make it.
-I'm sorry.
-Order me a drink, and then we'll fight.
Leo, two Scotch and waters, please.
Let's not spoil the night.
I've only a couple days left.
I'm leaving Sunday.
How do you expect me to feel... leaving me standing there all alone?
Why didn't you introduce me to your mother?
I wanted you to meet her, but there's a time for everything.
I'm sure.
Thank you.
To the most important woman in your life:
Mom.
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to ruin your big evening.
Guess I just bruise easily.
How should we celebrate?
We can go to the Fairmont, Top Of The Mark--anything you say.
Or we don't have to go to a club.
-Meaning what?
-I've only got 48 hours.
Willie, don't.
I love you.
All right.
Will you marry me?
-If there were more time--
-Don't look so embarrassed.
I didn't expect you to.
I guess t forgot how I was.
-I didn't mean it like that.
-Just another nightclub singer... for a big weekend.
Well, I don't want anymore of it.
-Not another minute!
-May!
Good luck, Mr. Keith.
Thanks, George.
Good-bye, Mother.
-Cable when you get to Pearl Harbor.
-If I can.
I'm worried.
That ship you're assigned to has been in lots of battles.
-Don't worry.
-Do you have enough spending money?
-More than enough.
-Take this extra $100, dear.
-Please don't cry.
-I can't help it.
You're all I have left.
Promise me to be careful.
Don't do anything foolish or dangerous.
I won't.
I promise.
Good-hye, sweetheart.
-Request permission to come on board.
-Permission granted.
-Sir, the Caine's a real beauty.
-The Caine is the inboard ship.
Crossing over.
This way, Keith.
This way, Keith.
Watch that enthusiasm.
Nobody's left that way about the Caine before.
-I'm sorry, sir.
I lost my footing.
-This is Lieutenant Keefer.
-How about logging him in, Tom?
-Your orders.
Those monstrous papers that transform ex-civilians into men without minds.
-I hate to do this to you--
-Gangway!
Lady with a baby.
Meatball, Horrible!
Pick up Mr. Keith's gear in the whaleboat.
Aye, sir.
This is our executive officer, Steve Maryk.
-Glad to have you.
-Thank you, sir.
Steve's the guy that gets things done.
There's one on every ship.
Very funny.
Come on, Keith.
Let's meet the captain.
-Watch your feet, sir!
-Come on, Keith.
They're making a mistake scraping this ship.
The only thing that's keeping the water out is the rust.
What do you want?
-He's here, sir.
-Okay.
Bring him in.
In here.
Captain DeVriess, this is Ensign Keith.
May I see your orders and qualifications jacket... or are they a military secret?
I'm sorry.
"Princeton, '41."'
"Top five percent in midshipman's school."
Pretty good background.
Pretty good record.
Disappointed they assigned you to a minesweeper?
Well, sir, to be honest--yes, sir.
You saw yourself on a carrier or battleship, no doubt?
Yes.
I had hoped--
Well, I only hope that you're good enough for the Caine.
I'll try to be worthy of this assignment.
She's not a battleship or carrier.
She's a beaten-up tub.
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24 hours a day to keep her in once piece.
-I understand.
-I don't think you do.
But whether you like it or not, you're in the junkyard navy.
Steve, put him with Keefer in communications, and tell Tom... to show this Princeton tiger and our other new ensign around the ship.
Yes, sir.
And Keith... don't take it so hard.
War is hell.
-Ensign Keith, Ensign Harding.
-My condolences.
-Thanks.
-All right.
Let's get with it.
The U.S.S. Caine is a minesweeper.
These are paravanes used for mine sweeping.
They carry sweep wires out both sides of the ship.
The wire contacts a mooring cable of a mine and saws it in two.
We've been in combat a year and a half and never been asked to sweep a mine.
The first thing to learn about this ship... is that she was designed by geniuses to be run by idiots.
This is the engine room.
To operate, all you need are well-trained monkeys.
Ninety-nine percent of everything we do is strict routine.
Only one percent requires creative intelligence.
Well, that about does it.
-Any more questions?
-Yes, sir.
-Where do we go to surrender?
-It's not that easy.
-You don't like the navy?
-Who called the Caine the navy?
Gentlemen, just one more thing to do:
Climb the mast.
What for?
A mast is a mast.
When the captain orders the tour, he means from the keel to the foretop.
That's the foretop.
I have a wife and a kid.
I'm very fond of them.
I'll probably never see them again.
Well done!
I'm glad he liked it.
Yeah.
Keith?
I regret to tell you I'm gonna be sick.
I'm sorry.
Height bothers me.
Those poor sailors down there!
I could use my hat, but it's the only one I've got.
I have two others.
-That's darn cordial of you.
-Perfectly welcome.
Hey!
What's keeping you guys up there?
Lunch!
Excuse me, sir.
It's all right.
Tell me.
Now that you've had a chance to study the Caine more closely... do you like her any better?
The tour was very interesting.
The ship too messy for you?
-That's a difficult question.
-It's a ridiculous question.
The question is, is this mess a ship?
Very decent of you to join us for lunch, Tom.
I didn't think you could spare the time.
My novel will suffer, but even great literary artists get hungry.
Pull up a chair, and cast some pearls before the swine.
-Or whatever it is you say you do.
-I will.
Somebody has to protect these fresh faces from the captain's badgering.
I'm not badgering anyone.
I'm just conducting a one-man board of inquiry.
I'm trying to find out... if Ensign Keith wants to stay on board.
There is no escape, save death.
We are all doing penance.
Sentenced to an outcast ship... manned by outcasts and named after the greatest outcast of them all.
Here we go again.
-I'm merely stating fact.
-He's right.
I've been sweating it out myself for over two years... waiting to be relieved of command, and there's no sign of it yet.
But then I don't have Ensign Keith's influence.
Sir, I don't understand.
I received this dispatch from Admiral Walsh about an hour ago.
"With your approval, will request transfer to my staff... for Ensign Willis Seward Keith.
Understand needs of U.S.S. Caine have priority.
I didn't know anything about this.
Could be coincidence.
Or someone pulling strings.
What'll it be?
The Admiral's staff or, as Tom puts it... the hell of the Caine?
I don't know.
It's a simple choice.
Do you want to fight a war?
This is hardly the place for a decision.
Nonsense.
A good officer can make up his mind anywhere.
Come on.
We haven't got all day.
Well, sir.
I'll stay on board.
That takes care of that.
Ah, Willie.
You will live to regret this day.
Sir, I spotted Japanese aircraft.
Broad on the starboard bow.
Position angle 20.
Do you see them, Captain?
ff the war lasts 10 years, you may learn the difference... between aircraft and sea gulls.
Man all stations for mine sweeping drill.
Launch sweep gear.
Put paravanes in the water.
Steve, that was the lousiest performance I've ever seen!
-Tell the men to get the lead out.
-Stand by to stream starboard side.
Retrieve sweep gear.
Snap it up!
The Jones is beating us in.
-Look out!
-Stop the engines.
-Get me a line.
-Don't swim.
The water's full of sharks!
-Stand by the line.
-Yes, sir.
This action dispatch just arrived.
Mr. Keefer says you've got the code duty.
I'tl take care of it right away.
Okay!
Haul away!
Lead the line outboard of everything.
Report float recovered.
The Jones never saw the day it could beat us.
You pooped out!
We streamed three minutes quicker at Guadalcanal!
You must love that guy to do what you did for him.
Go dry yourself.
-That you, Willie?
-Yeah.
-Didn't you say you went to Princeton?
-I didn't say.
One day I may let you read a couple chapters of my novel.
A Princeton man's opinion might he valuable.
Thanks.
-Horrible!
-Yes, sir?
Pick up those orange peels.
This isn't a honey barge.
Yes, sir.
All right, Meatball.
Laugh once more, and you're in trouble.
Ensign Keith, report to the captain's cabin.
On the double
All these 90-day wonders.
Every one of 'em thinks he's a five-star admiral!
-Come in.
-Yes, sir?
Three days ago this ship received a dispatch addressed to us for action.
Smitty says he gave it to you.
is that correct?
I forgot about it.
It's still in the pocket of my dirty khakis.
Did you decode the message?
No, sir.
It's incredible stupidity and carelessness on my part--
Fortunately, I had the job done for you.
-That'll be all, Smitty.
-Yes, sir.
Have you any idea how serious misplacing an action dispatch can be?
-Yes, sir.
-I don't think you have.
Because of you, this ship might have failed to carry out a combat assignment.
I hope you realize that for such a failure...
I'd bear the full responsibility in a court-martial.
I understand, sir.
I've been filling out officers' fitness reports this morning.
How do you think this ought to affect yours?
-Anyone can make a mistake.
-There are mistakes and mistakes.
The margin for error is narrow in the navy.
There's too much loss of life and property possible in every act.
Here.
Read it.
"Ensign Keith seems a fairly bright young man.
He may become a competent officer... once he overcomes a light and careless approach to his duties."
Do you consider it unfair?
-If I may be permitted?
-Go ahead.
I made a mistake, but I don't see why I should be singled out for it.
Every one's goofed off around here.
The Caine's a slake ship.
The men act like cutthroats... and the decks look like a Singapore junk.
t take it you must also strongly disapprove of me.
Go ahead.
Man-to-man.
I'm in no position to approve or disapprove.
I only know that my conception of a captain seems different than yours.
I'll take it under advisement.
Since you feel so bitter... perhaps what's in the dispatch will brighten your day.
As you can see, I'm being relieved of command.
Next week this time, you'll have yourself a new captain.
Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg.
-Feel better?
-Definitely, sir.
Good.
That'll be afI.
"In accordance with Bureau of Naval Personnel... order 0-1-6-0-2-1 of November, 1943... you'll report to the Commanding Officer U.S.S. Caine as his relief in command.
Signed, Lewis Whitfield, Rear Admiral, U.S.N., Chief of Bureau."
I relieve you, sir.
All standing orders to remain in force until further notice.
Dismiss the men from quarters.
-Good luck, Captain.
-Thank you.
Crew dismissed.
Oh, Captain.
I can stay aboard for a couple of days till you get used to things.
There's no need for that.
We all have our own ways of running a ship.
Sure.
This one's tired.
She's had the guts run out of her.
Ought to be melted down for razor blades.
The crew may not look like much.
They're tired too.
But every man is okay.
-I understand.
-I hope you do.
Yours, Captain.
Attention on deck.
-Request permission to leave the ship.
-Permission granted.
-Captain, sir?
-What is it, Meatball?
Nothing.
A few of the guys chipped in and--
Whose idea was this?
I won't accept it.
It's against navy regulations.
-I told them--
-You don't always go by regulations.
That's my trouble.
I've been aboard the Caine too long.
You men take an even strain with the new skipper..
and everything will he all right.
-I'm leaving the ship, sir.
-Yes, sir.
Well, what do you know.
Somebody left this watch lying around.
Might as well have a souvenir of this old bucket.
Not a bad-looking watch at that.
What time is it, Mr. Keith?
-Eleven hundred, sir.
-Make it 10:30.
I'll always keep it a half hour slow.
Remind me of the fouled-up crew of the Caine.
Carry on.
What's everybody so choked up for?
No matter what anybody says, I still think... that someday you'll make an officer.
Captain Queeg requests a meeting of all officers at 1300.
Gentlemen, we'll be shipmates for a long time... and I thought we ought to get acquainted.
I've formed some good impressions.
you're probably curious about me.
My background is simple enough.
Just another naval officer.
I've had seven tough years in the Atlantic.
Believe you me, they made the last two mighty interesting.
The way those subs ganged up on us I thought they had it in for me.
Now to get down to cases.
Any one who knows me knows I'm a book man.
I believe everything was put in it for a purpose.
When in doubt, remember we do things by the book.
Deviate from the book, and you'd better have good reasons... and you'll still get an argument from me.
And f don't lose arguments on board my ship.
That's one of the nice things about being captain.
I want you to remember one thing.
On my ship, excellent performance is standard.
Standard performance is substandard.
Substandard performance is not permitted to exist.
That, I warn you.
Now that I've shot my face off, any one can now do the same thing.
I don't wanna seem out of line... but it's been a long time since this crew did things by the book.
Mr. Maryk, tell the crew there are four ways of doing things on board my ship.
The right way, the wrong way, the navy way and my way.
They do things my way, we'll get along.
Aye, aye, sir.
Anyone else?
Come in.
Sorry to interrupt.
Official message from ComServPao.
Thank you.
One moment, messenger.
-What's your name and rate?
-Urban, sir.
Seaman First.
Signalman Striker.
Very well.
You may go.
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen... anyone notice anything peculiar about Seaman First Class Urban?
A shirttail hanging out of trousers is the uniform for busboys... not for a sailor in the United States Navy.
These are the things we are going to start noticing again.
Who's the morale officer?
There is no morale officer, sir.
-Who's the junior ensign?
-Keith, sir.
-Sir?
-You are now the morale officer.
In addition to y our duties, see that every man keeps his shirttail... tucked inside his trousers.
Aye, aye, sir.
If I see another shirttail flapping white I'm captain of this ship... woe betide the sailor, woe betide the O.O.D... and woe betide the morale officer-- I kid you not.
According to this, we're to proceed to Area X-ray... at 0800 tomorrow to tow targets.
I'll put it to you simply:
The Caine will be the best target-towing ship... in this man's navy.
That'tl be all, gentlemen.
All men are to have their hair out to regulation length... and their faces clean-shaven by 2400.
Aye, aye, sir.
Welf, he's certainly navy.
Yeah.
So was Captain Bligh.
Attention all hands!
Ships will commence firing at target at 1000.
All observers lay oft to the fantail.
Flash.
Short. 200.
Over.
One hundred.
Two-fifty.
Hit.
Over.
One hundred.
Two-fifty.
Short.
One hundred.
Over. 150, 200.
Ensign Keith report to the bridge on the double.
Yes, sir?
Have you any explanation for the appearance of this sailor?
-You heard my order on shirttails.
-I got a heat rash--
-Tuck your shirt in now.
-The captain won't let me.
I want you to see what a rotten job you're doing.
Gwendolyn, this is Tarzan.
Tarzan, this is Gwendolyn.
Cease present exercises and return to base.
-Well done.
Out.
-Roger.
Thank you, sir.
We're heading back.
Right standard rudder.
And now, first of all... do you or don't you have an explanation for this?
-I was on the--
-I didn't ask for an alibi.
My orders mean very little to you.
I'm completely at fault.
But I tried my best--
Your best is only a maximum of inefficiency.
What's the matter with the old man?
We're steaming in a circle.
Yeah, I know.
-Captain.
-Don't interrupt while I'm speaking.
-We're going--
-One more word and you're on report.
Can you explain why this occurred while you were officer of the deck?
There are limits to what a man can do.
The officer of the deck is equally as responsible for his duties... as I am for the welfare of this ship.
And one thing more, mister.
War is a 24-hour job.
There will be no more novel writing on the Caine.
You will both submit written reports explaining...
A: why this man had his shirttail out.
B: why you failed so miserably to carry out my orders.
Aye, aye.
Hey, Meatball!
Am I seeing straight... or are we cutting back across our towline?
That's impossible.
But it's happened!
We're gonna out across our own towline!
-You better tell him again.
-Not me.
What's happened?
What's going on?
What's our target doing out there?
-What have you been doing?
-You said keep right standard rudder.
You idiot!
All engines stop.
Captain, we've steamed over our own towline!
-Who said that?
-We've cut the target adrift.
We did nothing of the kind.
Something is wrong with the cable.
We can't be responsible if we're given faulty cables that break.
Should we recover the target?
It shouldn't take more than half an hour.
Half an hour?
That means we'll be the last ship back in Pearl Harbor.
No, thank you.
We're not gonna answer questions about something... that's not our fault.
-Reel in the cable.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Send the following dispatch to ComServPac.
Defective towline parted southwest corner X-ray.
Target adrift.
Menace to navigation.
Suggest tug recover or destroy.
He'll never get away with it.
-Let's head for the barn.
-Aye, aye, sir.
All engines ahead full.
-Sir?
-You look worried.
I know a man's shirt's a petty detail... but big things are made up of details.
"For want of a nail a horseshoe was lost"... and then the whole battle.
A captain's job is a lonely one.
He's easily misunderstood.
Forget that I bawled you out.
It was the good of the morale of all concerned.
Yes, sir.
Hallelujah!
Look what just came in.
-We're going back to San Francisco.
-You're kidding?
All thanks to our beloved Captain Queeg.
He's in plenty of hot water.
I told you they'd never accept his double-talk about the towline.
They can't send us all the way back for that.
Listen: "Upon arrival, commanding officer report immediately... oommander western sea frontier."
t tell you, he's in serious trouble.
Our captain is about to be boiled in oil.
And you are about to see your girl.
-Willie, darling!
-Mother.
-This is a real surprise.
-You didn't expeot me not to be here.
It's wonderful to have my boy close again.
Mother...
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
May Wynn.
I'm always delighted to meet one of Wiflie's friends.
Thank you.
Hello?
Hello, May.
Sure.
I'll he right down then.
-I guess I'm ready to go.
-I'm afraid I'll miss you a lot.
tt's just a weekend at Yosemite.
This sailor needs some playtime.
Miss Wynn is going with you?
Yes, she is.
You must feel very strongly about her.
I do.
I like her a tot.
Now, you have a nice weekend yourself.
-Are you in love with her?
-I don't know.
But I sure missed her while I was away.
Well, she is attractive.
But you don't know anything ahout her.
-You haven't met her parents.
-That's right.
I guess I'll have to do that someday.
For your own sake, all I want you to do is--
-Promise you won't do anything rash.
-I promise.
-You mean it?
-Sure I mean it.
Good-bye, Mom.
-Whoa!
-Pull him up easy.
That's good.
-How did you like it?
-Like breaking in a new song--
It's fun, but it scares me.
It was nice of your mother to let you go to Yosemite.
-It wasn't up to my mother.
-Well!
Six months of war has made a difference.
Has it?
I missed you more than f planned to.
Let the fire fall!
-This is paradise.
-Isn't it?
Willie, there are people.
Let them look.
You have changed.
Sometimes I think there's almost a chance for us.
It's getting late.
It's getting very late.
I'll wait.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Sorry I'm late.
Guess I'm not used to being without an alarm clock.
Oh, what a day!
Have you ordered yet?
-Not yet.
-Just orange juice and coffee, please.
Make it two.
You know what I'd love to do?
I'd love to climb to the top of that mountain over there.
Darfing, what's the matter?
-Just thinking.
-Come on.
Something's the matter.
-I expected you to be happy.
-May.
What would you think of spending your life with a monster tike me?
-What's this?
-I'm talking about getting married.
-Is that what you really want?
-Of course I want it.
Don't look at me as if I were crazy.
I don't want you to marry me because you think it's a doesn't thing to do--
Look--
I love you, and I wanna marry you.
Yes or no?
-Why not?
-Because your mother won't approve.
-Of course she'll approve.
-She won't.
But you'll marry me anyway.
And you'll be so unhappy that--
I won't be unhappy.
I love you.
Maybe you do.
Really do.
But marriage'll have to be hy our own approval.
No one else's.
That's asking a lot.
That's right.
Have a good cry, Willie.
I know I will!
-In 30 seconds you"d have been A.W.O.L.
-I just got the telegram.
And you couldn't tear your self away from your girl?
Yeah.
Any news on Queeg?
Single up all lines, and stand by to cast off!
Hope you haven't been inconvenienced, Mr. Keith.
Seems like you made a slight mistake.
He's still here.
My mistake was nothing compared to the navy's.
Take in the bow.
Well, as you probably know by now... we returned to San Francisco for a new radar installation.
However, misleading reports were sent to the force commander.
This created doubts in his mind as to the Caine's competence in combat.
I made it clear I inherited a ship in a low state of training... and couldn't he expected to pull it into shape overnight.
He agreed.
From now on, there will not he any further mistakes... on the part of the officers and orew of this ship.
Some smoke went down the wrong way.
This is an important command.
The navy's waiting for a butoh.
Well, I'm not going to make it.
And I'm not gonna permit anybody to make it for me.
So much for old business.
Gentlemen, I've good news for you.
We're on our way to the greatest invasion attempted in this war.
I kid you not.
The greatest.
Let's all straighten up and fly right!
All hands put on battle dress.
All hands put on battle dress and anti-flash cream.
We don't have to shoot the Japs.
We can scare 'em to death.
Cease fire!
Close the boat group and take station.
Keith, take the conn.
Aye, aye, sir.
That's the group we take in.
Jacob Group Four.
Come right to course 0-4-5.
All engines ahead full.
We're closing too fast.
We'll run those boats down.
-Where's the captain?
-On the wing.
How did he let you handle a ship at a time like this?
All engines stop.
Boat ahoy!
What's going on?
Who's yelling to whom?
It looked like we were overshooting these boys, so I stopped.
What's the distance to the beach?
-About three miles.
We're supposed--
-I know.
Within 1, 000 yards.
You take the conn.
Get us there.
Full speed ahead.
We will proceed.
Follow us.
Good luck.
Okay.
Thanks.
Left tangent 0-0-6.
Beaoon 0-8-4.
Distance, 5, 000.
We're too far ahead of the attack group.
Engines back one-third.
Left tangent 3-5-0.
Beaoon 1-1-6.
Distance, 4, 000.
-Why are we slowing down?
-We were losing them.
If they can't keep up, throw over a dye-marker when we reach the spot.
We're getting too close!
You wanna run us on the beach?
We still have at least 1, 500 yards to go.
You're crazy!
I can read instruments as well as anybody on this ship!
We're within 1, 000 yards now!
This is as far as we must go!
Left full rudder.
Atl engines ahead full.
Throw over a dye-marker.
You heard me!
Fantail for bridge.
Throw over a dye-marker.
-We can't leave those marines!
-I'm taking the conn.
I relieve you.
Aye, aye.
-What's he doing?
Running away?
-Don't look for trouble.
Well, what do you think of your boy now?
I don't know.
There must be a reason for what he did.
Yeah.
There's a reason, all right.
I've got those yellowstain blues
Those silly yellowstain blues
When someone fires a shot
It's always f here I am not
I've got those yellowstain blues
The old yellowstain blues
Those yellowstain blues
-We better pipe down.
-Don't be so worried.
It's time you got over being impressed hy people with authority... like parents and ships' captains.
-Thanks, Dad.
-You're welcome.
More!
I've got those yellowstain blues
Down from my head to my shoes
Oh, you should see strong men quail
If he should spy a shirttail
All right, Harding.
Cut it.
Steve.
Thought you'd be amused.
This is a saga of a man whose tack of charm... is exceeded only by his lack of intestinal fortitude.
It's not funny.
You ought to know better.
Find somebody else to sing about.
That's an order!
Why?
Old Yellowstain ought to be flattered.
I don't wanna hear the name Old yellowstain again.
The captain wants a meeting in the wardroom immediately.
And he kids us not!
Don't get up, gentlemen.
I'm not feeling too well.
What I have to say won't take long.
That'll be all, steward.
I know some of you were, perhaps, a little afraid of me.
I'm not that terrible.
I have a wife, a child and a dog.
They're rather fond of me.
Even the dog doesn't think I'm a monster.
Perhaps certain things happened today.
As I always say, a command is a lonely job.
It isn't easy to make decisions.
Sometimes the captain of a ship needs help--by help I mean... oonstructive loyalty.
What I'm trying to say is... a ship is like a family.
We all have our ideas of right and wrong... but we have to pitch in for the good of the family.
If there was only some way we oould help each other.
l--
If there's anything any of you would like to say...
I'll be glad to listen.
Welt, I've spoken my piece.
I only hope it registers.
Don't get up.
Please.
Paynter.
Have the pharmacist send some more aspirin.
My headache's much worse.
Yes, sir.
This is what is known in literature as the pregnant pause.
There's only one thing left to do:
Write to Walter Winohell.
I almost felt sorry for him.
Don't be so sentimental.
I thought it was a pretty good speech.
It was as close to an apology as he could get.
We could've backed him up.
What could we have said?
He turned yellow the first time we saw action.
Look, Princeton, you knew nothing about DeVriess; you know less about Queeg.
He's a tired man.
His nerves are shot.
It's happened before--a man loses his head--after what Queeg's gone through.
That's a very endearing explanation.
But it won't hold.
Has it ever occurred to you that our captain might be unbalanced?
-Cut the jokes.
-I'm no psychiatrist... but I know something about abnormal behavior.
Captain Queeg has every symptom of acute paranoia.
It's just a question of time before he goes over the line.
-Step outside, Keith.
-I'd like to stay.
Let him.
He studied psychology at college.
You're fooling with dynamite.
Look at the man!
He's a Freudian delight.
He crawls with clues.
His fixation on the little rolling balls.
The chattering in secondhand phrases and slogans.
His inability to look you in the eye, his migraine headaches.
Shirttails and tonight's pathetic speech:
"Forget about my turning yellow.
My dog likes me."
I think Tom makes sense.
You stay out of this.
All right.
So he has migraine headaches... and he rolls steel balls and does other screwy things.
So what?
You'd get up before reveille and fill papers with scribbling.
Everybody's a screwball in some way.
That doesn't make them crazy.
You'r e kidding yourself.
Will you go over to the medical officer with me... and repeat everything you've told me?
-Do you agree with my diagnosis?
-Not a word of it.
-Even if I understood what you said.
-Well, then.
Why should you expect me to take this on my shoulders?
If you don't see it, I don't stand a chance.
Then we drop it right now.
There'll be no more talk ahout the captain being crazy.
Like running around explosives with a blowtorch.
I still insist he's a paranoia case.
See this Bible?
I swear to you on this...
I'll report to the captain anything further you say along those lines.
There's no more friendship on this point.
That's the straight dope.
Medical log on Lieutenant Commander X-Ray.
This log is being started because the possibility exists... that the commander of this ship may be mentally disturbed.
March 5th, 1944.
This evening we were showing a Hopalong Cassidy movie on the forecastle.
Stop the picture!
Will you please stop this picture!
Attention on deck
Why wasn't I notified this movie was being shown?
Last week you told me you couldn't look at another Western.
-I just assumed--
-You assumed?
This was calculated disrespect to your commanding officer.
All right!
There will be no more movies for 30 days.
May 28, 1944.
Morale couldn't be lower.
The crew is resentful... the officers just going through the motions of carrying out orders.
This afternoon the captain held a general drill... for the instruction and safety of the crew.
This is the captain speaking.
Many men have ignored my orders about wearing battle gear.
So there's only one way to drive the point home.
Men not wearing a helmet or life jacket will be docked three-days' liberty.
I see you!
Stop putting on that gear!
Mr. Keith.
Put that man down there without a life jacket on report.
-Which one?
-That one down there on the machine gun!
You people think you're very clever!
Well, you're not fooling me!
Get that redheaded fellow over there!
I can't tell which one is redheaded.
They're all wearing helmets.
Keith!
You're an idiot!
This is the captain.
Some sailors still think they can pull a fast one on me.
They're mistaken.
Since you've taken this course... the innocent will be punished with the guilty.
No liberty for any crew member for three months!
I will not be made a fool of!
Do you hear me?
July 30, 1944.
July 30, 1944.
Today we received a gift from the officers of the U.S.S. Pinkney-- a gallon of frozen strawberries.
I was checking the watch at 1:00 AM when I stopped to speak to Ensign Keith.
How's it going?
Situation quiet.
The captain's been put away for the night.
Lay off.
You know that I was with you and against Tom in the beginning.
But I don't see how the Caine can go on like this much longer!
You haven't the experience to know one way or another.
-I'm not blind!
I've watched the man--
-All right.
The captain's in rocky shape, but he'll oome out of it.
He's got to.
Mr. Maryk, Mr. Keith.
Captain wants a meeting of all officers right away.
-At 1:00 in the morning?
-Yes, sir.
-You know what it's ahout?
-Yes, sir.
Strawberries.
-You're sure this is a gallon can?
-Yes, sir.
I took it from the pantry.
I suppose you're wondering why I called this meeting.
You alt know we had an excellent dessert of ice cream and frozen strawberries.
About an hour ago, I sent Whittaker to bring me another portion.
He came back with the ice cream, but he said...
"Sir, there ain't no more strawberries."'
Gentlemen, I don't believe that the officers of this ship... consumed a full gallon of strawberries.
I intend to prove it.
How many portions of ice cream and strawberries did you have?
-Two, sir.
-Whittaker.
Dole out a scoop of sand for eaoh portion of strawberries.
Yes, sir.
-Mr.
Keefer, how many for you?
-Three, Captain.
-Keith?
-Two, sir.
-Harding?
-Two, sir.
-Paynter?
-Two, sir.
-Carmody?
-Two, sir.
-Jorgenson?
-Two, sir.
-Rabbit?
-Two, sir.
And the steward's mates had three, right?
Yes, sir.
One helping eaoh.
-Mr.
Keith said it was okay.
-Yes, I did, sir.
And I had four.
Two--
Twenty-four portions in all.
This tureen holds an amount of sand equal to the strawberries we had.
-Right, Whittaker?
-Yes, sir.
Look at this gallon can and tell me how much sand is left.
A quart or less.
Have any of you an explanation for the quart of missing strawberries?
There can be no doub t someone finished them for us.
You are all appointed a board of investigation... to find out who's responsible for this theft.
Mr. Maryk, you are the senior member.
You mean in the morning?
Now does not mean in the morning.
It means 0147.
I expeot a full report by 0800.
All right!
Pipe down.
The faster we get this done, the faster we get sleep.
-Send in the stewards, one at a time.
-Yes, sir.
If the strawberries had been poisoned our problems would have been solved.
Strawberries, anyone?
-Unsatisfactory.
-I'm sorry, Captain.
We kept the mess boys and the cook most of the night.
They may be lying, but it's a dead end.
We couldn't keep covering the ground endlessly.
You spent the entire night and accomplished nothing... while I've thought the whole thing out very clearly.
Did it ever occur to you that some boy made a duplicate key to the icebox?
There's no indication--
There's some things we must assume in order to be a good officer.
Baok in '3T when I was a lowly ensign on a cruiser... five pounds of cheese was missing.
Everybody was willing to forget about it.
But not me.
I snooped and found some chowhound had made a wax impression of the key.
I made him confess and got myself a nice letter of commendation.
This looks to me like exactly the same situation.
-We can't be sure there's--
-You've tried every other solution.
I've worked out a very simple plan.
First, we collect every key on this ship and tag it with the name of the owner.
Second, we strip all hands to make sure we've got all keys.
Third, we test each key on the icebox padlock.
The one that fits will give us the name of the owner.
-How do we know there's such a key?
-I say there's a key.
Captain, what's to prevent this boy from tossing the key overboard?
No.
He'd never toss it after he's gone to all the trouble making it.
He may try to hide it, but we'll find it.
I never thought of that.
Don't stand there.
Get on the ball.
We'll have a little fun, now that we've detective work to do.
Yes, sir.
Turn me in if you want to, but this is it.
This is over the line.
Queeg is a paranoid or there's no such thing as paranoia.
-I warned you.
-Can't you see what he's doing?
He's reenacting the big triumph of his career :
The cheese investigation.
He wants to prove he's still the red-hot Queeg of 193T.
There is no key.
-What happened to the strawberries?
-Does it matter?
Is it worth turning a ship upside-down?
Woutd anyone hut a crazy man do it?
Are you familiar with Article 184 of navy regulations?
Vaguely.
Here.
Listen to this:
On the Caine it's required reading.
"Article 184 :
It is conceivable that most unusual circumstances may arise... in which the relief from duty of a commanding officer becomes necessary... either by placing him under arrest or on the sick list.
Such actions are not to he taken without approval of the Navy Department... except when it is impracticable because of the delay involved."
If I were you, I'd memorize it.
I'll take these to the captain.
-Great weather for stripping down.
-Great for pneumonia.
-That wouldn't stop the investigation.
-Next.
-Meatball, get dressed.
-Don't you wanna x-ray me for the key?
I've seen him!
He swallowed the key with his coffee.
Very tricky!
Pipe down, both of you.
So long, fellas.
Don't tell me you're escaping from the Caine.
I got dispatch orders hack to the states.
My wife is seriously ill.
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-She'll be all right.
We'll keep you posted on the outcome of the great key investigation.
-Do that.
-Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
If I tell you something, will you promise not to do anything about it?
At least till I'm ashore?
-Okay, what is it?
-There is no key.
-What?
-How do you know?
I know.
The mess boys ate the strawberries.
I saw them.
I didn't want to get them into trouble.
Then I made my mistake.
I told the captain.
He called me a liar and threatened to hold up my orders if I mentioned it.
Pfease, don't say anything.
You can count on us.
Boy, am I happy to get out of this madhouse.
So long, and good luck.
I'll call all your wives and girls for you.
Well?
I've been thinking about what you've said.
I've been thinking ahout Article 184, and I've got to admit you're right.
Admiral Halsey's here with the fleet.
How about seeing him after we finish with this nonsense?
Sure.
You too, Willie.
Request permission to come on board-- Admiral Halsey's quarters.
-Official business from the Caine.
-Very well.
Lieutenant Jones?
-He'd like to see the admiral.
-Very well.
Come with me.
Just a minute please, gentlemen.
This is a fine time to think of this, but we're making a big mistake.
-What are you talking about?
-Look at this!
We've been kidding ourselves.
This is the real navy!
With real officers, not Queegs!
The Caine's a freak, a floating mistake.
-What are you driving at?
-They'll never believe our story.
f don't get it.
Is Queeg off his head or isn't he?
-Is this record correct or not?
-Yes, it's correct.
The trouble is, we won't be able to make it stick.
Everything you've got in your log oan be interpreted as an attempt at discipline.
-But we know different.
-Because we've lived through it.
-Halsey hasn't.
-Why didn't you tell me this before?
Just he glad I thought of it now.
If we go through with this, we're in trouble.
It won't mean as much to Wilfie and me as it will to you.
You want to stay in the navy.
Do you want them thinking you're a mutinous officer?
-Tom has an argument there.
-I'm willing to take a chance.
-Are you scared?
-Scared?
I see six sides to every risk and 12 reasons not to take it.
Cut the kidding.
Behind this brilliant, eloquent exterior, I've got a wide yellow streak.
I'm too smart to be brave.
Admiral Halsey will see you now.
-I pass.
-Thank the admiral.
We've decided this isn't the time.
Sfafions.
Special sea and anchor detail.
Make all preparations for getting underway.
Make all preparations for heavy weather.
Dismissed from quarters.
Steve, what do we do now?
Without Tom, I couldn't get to first base.
I'd never even heard the word paranoid.
He's got to make the pitch or we're sunk.
t don't get it.
Tom's certainly not a coward.
To tell you the truth, I don't know what Tom is now.
You'd better double-time back to your ship.
We've received a storm warning.
The fleet's getting underway.
-Turn on the standard lights.
-Aye, sir.
Sir, the barometer's still dropping.
-I've seen it.
-The chief engineer wants to know... if you're gonna take on ballast?
-Tell him no.
-I suggest that we do.
I'm not going to foul up his fuel lines with salt water.
This following sea is brutal!
We need more knots to outrun it.
Bridge to engine control.
This is the captain.
You in the engine room, f want power.
Power on the starboard engine, do you hear?
Emergenoy flank power.
Do you want the ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon!
Close that door!
-Sir, I've relieved the watch.
-Pass the word to put on life jackets.
It's difficult holding her, sir!
The wheel feels loose.
I don't know if we can keep riding with our stern to the wind!
Those are fleet orders.
I think the depth charges should be put on safe.
They are on safe.
Mr. Keefer gave me orders to set them.
Why wasn't I told?
I can't go steaming around with a lot of dead charges!
-I told Mr. Keefer--
-Speak when you're spoken to!
Put this man on report for insolence and neglect of duty!
Get another helmsman.
Keep that idiot's face out of my sight!
-Stilwell's our best man!
-Will you stop this hack talk!
Isn't there one officer that pays attention to my orders?
Number one switchboard shorted out by salt water!
Shifted to number two!
We're falling off to starboard!
We're abroaching-to!
Try backing the starboard engine!
Sir!
Back-to starboard engine!
Look in the radar shack.
See if there are any ships near us.
Aye, aye, sir.
If we keep running with our stern to the wind, we'll roll over!
The radars are jammed There's no sign of the fleet!
Passing 2-2-5!
Swinging very fast!
We have to maneuver for the safety of the ship!
We've received no orders to maneuver.
Fleet course is 1-8-0.
How do you know what the fleet's orders are now?
We can call fleet commander and tell him we're in trouble!
We're not in trouble.
Heading 2-4-5!
I can't hold the wheel!
Back-to starboard engine!
Stilwell, hold her to hard right!
Ease your rudder to standard!
Rudder easing to standard!
Heading 3-2-5.
She's coming around slower, sir!
We'll do much better heading into the wind.
Steady on 0-0-0!
Who gave those orders?
Fleet course is 1-8-0!
Captain, we're in serious trouble!
If you question my decisions again, I'll order you off this bridge.
Come left!
Stilwell, steady as you go.
Willie, note the time.
Captain, I'm sorry, but you're a sick man.
I'm relieving you as captain under Article 184.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Helmsman, left, 1-8-0!
Mr. Keith, what do I do?
You're the officer of the deck.
I told you to come left!
Come left and fast!
I'm sorry, but you're not issuing orders on this bridge anymore.
I've relieved you.
I take full responsibility.
You're under arrest.
Go below to your cabin.
-Left to 1-8-0.
-Right standard rudder!
New course, 0-0-0!
Mr. Keith, what do I do?
Come north, Stilwell.
Mr. Maryk has taken command.
Call your relief!
You're under arrest too!
All officers not on watch report to the bridge!
This is Maryk.
-What's up?
-I have just relieved the captain.
He will continue to be treated with courtesy... but from now on, I will give all orders!
I take full responsibility for this action.
Don't kid yourself!
Mr. Keith hacked you up.
He'll pay the same as you will!
Officers, if you know what's good for you, tell them to stop while they can!
You officers approve?
Do you, Mr. Keefer?
It's not up to Mr. Keefer to approve.
You'll all hang for conspiracy to mutiny!
Everybody back to their stations.
Hold the course 0-0-0.
-It's right over there.
-Thank you.
Yes.
This is Ensign Keith.
New York?
Thank you.
Hello?
I've been trying to get you all day.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
How are you?
An officer from your ship called.
Ensign Harding.
He told me that you were in trouble.
I'm worried.
Is your mother with you?
No.
She's in Washington.
Uncle Lloyd's sick.
I'm sorry to hear it.
It was wonderful of you to phone.
May, darling--
Willie, please don't.
What an idiot I was.
I could have married you in the most beautiful place in the world.
I'll regret that I didn't for the rest of my life.
Please.
It's over.
It's all in the past.
But I want you to know that I love you.
And I'll never forget you.
Good-bye, Willie.
Thank you.
-Mr.
Maryk?
-I'm Maryk.
My name's Barney Greenwald.
Pleased to meet you.
Have a crack-up?
Yeah.
-Are you our lawyer?
-Well, I'm a lawyer.
This is Ensign Keith.
Lieutenant Keefer.
-You're the co-defendant?
-Yes, sir.
-And you, Mr. Keefer?
-I'm holding his coat.
-What does that mean?
-I'm a friend of the family.
That's pretty flip under the circumstances.
Sorry.
I was on board the Caine.
Communications officer.
I'm gonna be frank.
I've read the preliminary investigation, and what you've done stinks.
If that's how you feel, why are you taking the case?
I didn't say I'd take it.
I told legal I'd have a talk with Mr. Maryk.
It depends on what he has to say.
Maybe you'd better get another lawyer.
Try it.
Eight other officers have already turned it down.
I don't want to upset you, but you have an excellent chance of being hanged.
We'll answer anything you wanna know.
All right.
Which are you?
A fool or a mutineer?
There's no third possibility.
The only way I could prove I was right was to let the ship go down.
-Three ships were lost in the typhoon.
-Sure.
And 194 stayed afloat without relieving the skipper.
-There wasn't any other choice!
-Hold it.
Maybe I was a fool, but I'm not a mutineer.
He should get a medal for what he did.
He had a paranoid skipper who fell apart when the ship was in danger.
He saved the ship.
The navy has three psychiatrists prepared to say Oueeg is sane.
Sure.
Paranoids are clever.
They walk a thin line between sanity and lunacy.
Are you a psychiatrist?
No, I'm a writer.
It's my business to be a judge of human behavior.
I see.
And you were the first to notioe the captain's psychotic symptoms?
Yes.
You explained all this to Mr. Maryk?
I discussed it.
That's an interesting point.
Are you ready to repeat it on the witness stand?
Why not?
You ought to take a look at Article 186 of navy regulations.
"An officer relieving his commanding officer, or recommending such action... together with afI others who so council... must bear the legitimate responsibility and must justify such aotion."
That's confusing the issue.
I'm not on trial.
If I were, I'd take the rap.
It's too bad we can't use you as an expert on psychiatry.
After all, you made the diagnosis.
Yes.
The atmosphere's getting a little thick in here.
If you can get along without me, I'll wait in the hall.
Tom had nothing to do with it.
It was my decision.
-Nobody told me what to do.
-Sure.
Will you take the case?
I'd much rather prosecute.
Well, I guess I can't blame you.
I'll take it.
-How do we plead?
-Your case depends on Maryk.
-Then how do I plead?
-Not guilty, of course.
You're a great naval hero.
"Charge: making a mutiny.
Specification:
In that, Stephen Maryk, United States Naval Reserve... while serving on board the U.S.S. Caine, did, on or about July 31, 1944... willfully, forcibly, and without proper authority... relieve Lieutenant Commander Philip Queeg, U.S. Navy... who was then and there engaged in the lawful exercise of his command--
the United States then being in a state of war.
You've heard the charge and specification preferred against you.
How say you to the specification?
Guilty or not guilty?
-Not guilty.
-How say you to the charge?
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Not guilty.
The prosecution is prepared to prove... that the removal of Lieutenant Commander Oueeg was not justified... by any provision of the U.S. Navy regulations... and consequently constituted the making of a mutiny against legal authority.
We'll also submit psychiatric testimony, establishing, without a doubt... that Lieutenant Commander Queeg is a sane, intelligent officer... and should not have been relieved.
No statement at this time.
In order to establish the circumstances... the prosecution would like to first call Ensign Willis Keith.
Mr. Keith, were you the officer of the deok on the D.M.S. Caine... during the morning of July 31st?
Yes.
Was the captain relieved by the executive officer during that watch?
-Yes, sir.
-Do you know why he took that action?
I do.
The captain lost control of himself, and the ship was in danger of foundering.
Have you ever been in a ship that foundered?
-No, sir.
-How long have you been in the navy?
Just over a year.
Do you know how many years Lieutenant Commander Queeg served at sea?
-No.
-As a matter of fact... he's served over eight years.
Which of you is better qualified to judge if a ship is foundering?
Myself, sir... when I'm in possession of my faculties and Commander Queeg is not.
Tell me, just how would you describe this loss of faculties?
Did the captain rave or make insane gestures?
Well, no.
After being relieved, did he go violently crazy?
He was never wild or raving either before or after being relieved.
There are other forms of mental illness.
Thank you for your expert opinion.
Are you aware he's been pronounced rational by 3 qualified psychiatrists?
They weren't on the bridge during that typhoon.
Did you like the captain?
-At first I did.
-And later?
Well, I felt he was incompetent and unfair.
He blamed the crew for his mistakes and rode the men too hard.
-Yourself included?
-Yes.
So you ended up by hating Captain Queeg?
Yes.
Let's come to the morning of the 31st of July.
Was your decision to obey Mr. Maryk... based upon your judgement that the captain had gone crazy... or was it based on your hatred of Captain Oueeg?
It's contempt of court to refuse to answer questions.
I believe Mr. Maryk did the right thing.
That's all.
No further questions.
I'd like to ask you if you've ever heard the expression...
"Of Old Yellowstain"?
Could you repeat that?
-I've heard it.
-Was it a nickname?
Yes.
For Captain Oueeg.
-What did it imply?
-It implied cowardice.
I object.
I move that question be struck from the record... as an unnecessary attack upon the honor of a naval officer.
The career of an officer with a 14-year unblemished record is involved here.
The court understands your zeal, but I warn you... you bear fufI responsibility for your conduct of the case.
The court holds in abeyance the prosecution's motion.
Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon?
-No, sir.
-That's all.
No further questions.
The court has no questions.
You are warned not to discuss your testimony with anyone... except the parties to the trial and the accused.
You're excused.
The ship was rollin' real bad.
I couldn't hold her.
Captain wanted me to come left, and the exec wanted me to oome right.
-Which did you do?
-I obeyed Mr. Maryk, sir.
-Why?
-Mr.
Keith said Mr. Maryk had command.
-Did the captain act crazy?
-No.
-Did Mr. Maryk act crazy?
-No.
-Did the captain seem soared?
-No.
-Did Mr. Maryk seem scared?
-No.
-Did any one?
-Just me.
I was da--
I was plenty scared.
-Did you like Captain Queeg?
-I liked him.
Not a tot, but I liked him.
He acted strange.
Was it strange he cleaned up the Caine?
Was it strange he made the men get haircuts?
Was it strange he was strict about navy regulations?
-No.
-What you thought strange... was his attempts to make good sailors of his crew.
That's all.
What do those stars represent?
What do they represent?
This silver star is the Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, Tulagi--
That's all.
Call Lieutenant Thomas Keefer.
When did you first learn about Captain Queeg's relief?
When did you first learn about Captain Queeg's relief?
Mr. Maryk oaf led us to the bridge.
When we arrived, he told us he'd assumed command.
Did Captain Queeg show any external signs of being sick?
At the height of a typhoon, nobody looks very well.
Didn't you realize that Captain Queeg's warning to the other officers... about collusion in mutiny was well-founded?
-I did.
-Then why did you take no action?
I wasn't present when the captain was relieved.
So I didn't know what he'd done in a critical moment... to have convinced the executive officer he was sick.
For the safety of the ship, my best course was to obey Mr. Maryk's order... until such time as higher authority endorsed or overruled his action.
During all the period Captain Queeg was in command of the Caine... did you observe any evidence of insanity in him?
I can't answer that question intelligently, not being a psychiatrist.
Did you ever have any reason to think Captain Queeg might be insane?
Objection.
The witness isn't an expert.
Matters of opinion are not permissible evidence.
Strike it from the record.
At anytime prior to the 31st of July... did you know Mr. Maryk suspected Captain Queeg of being mentally if I?
Yes.
Mr. Maryk showed me a medical log he'd written on Queeg's behavior.
Did you believe that log justified the relief of Captain Queeg?
-Well, sir--
-Yes or no.
No, sir.
Mr. Maryk was a close friend of mine.
He persuaded Mr. Keith and me to see Admiral Halsey.
When we arrived, I told him as forcibly as I could... that the log didn't justify such action... and that we'd all be liable to a charge of mutiny.
Were you surprised when Mr. Maryk relieved the captain?
I was flabbergasted.
Were you pleased?
I've said Mr. Maryk was a close friend.
I was disturbed.
I anticipated that at best... he would be involved in great difficulty.
No further questions.
No questions.
Does defense intend to recall witness at a later time?
No, sir.
-No cross-examination?
-No, sir.
-Witness excused.
-He's lying!
Every time he opens his mouth he gets you into more trouble.
Forget it.
I want one hero, not two mutineers.
Call Dr. Dix on, please.
-How'd it go?
-Ordeal.
You know.
-You were on the hot seat yourself.
-I didn't know if I was coming or going.
But you're the word king.
You know what you were doing.
Yeah.
I knew what I was doing.
May I ask you, as a psychiatrist... is it possible for a sane man to perform offensive or foolish acts?
-It happens every day.
-Assuming for a moment--
This is a hypothetical question.
Assuming the captain's conduct was harsh and often showed bad judgement... would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him?
No.
My colleagues and I didn't find Commander Queeg a perfect officer.
We found an absence of mental illness.
You still say the defendant was unjustified in relieving him?
From a psychiatric standpoint, completely unjustified.
Your witness.
My background is legal, not medical.
Forgive me if I ask elementary questions.
That's all right.
You've said previously that Commander Queeg, like all adults... had problems which he handled well.
What problems?
I object.
Commander Oueeg isn't on trial.
Lieutenant Maryk is.
This constitutes irrelevant probing of medical confidences.
I rely on the court's judgement.
Evidence regarding Queeg's mental makeup is of utmost importance to my case.
Objection overruled.
The doctor may answer within the limits of medical discretion.
Repeat the question.
"You've said previously that Commander Queeg, like all adults... had problems which he handled well.
What problems?"
The overall problem... is one of inferiority, arising from an unfavorable childhood... and aggravated by adult experiences.
What were those adult experiences?
He'd undergone a lot of strain... in long, arduous combat duty.
That's all I can say.
Sir, would he be inclined to admit mistakes?
None of us are.
-Would he be a perfectionist?
-Yes.
Inclined to hound subordinates about small details?
Yes.
Would he be inclined to think that people were hostile to him?
That's part of the picture, yes.
And if criticized, would he feel he was being unjustly persecuted?
It's all one pattern stemming from one premise.
He must try to be perfect.
You testified the following symptoms exist in Commander Queeg's behavior :
rigidity of personality, feelings of persecution... unreasonable suspicion, a mania for perfection... and a neurotic certainty that's he's always right.
Isn't there one psychiatric term for this illness?
I never said there was illness!
Thank you for the correction, sir.
What would you call a personality that had these symptoms?
A paranoid personality, but that's not a disabling illness.
What kind of personality?
-Paranoid.
-Thank you, sir.
If I may speak.
I'd tike to protest the council's twisting of words.
There's a difference between mental illness and minor mental disturbances.
Let me put it this way :
Could Captain Queeg have been disabled by the severe strain of command?
That's absurdly hypothetical.
Is it?
Have you ever had sea duty?
-No.
-Have you ever been at sea?
-No.
-How long have you been in the navy?
Five months.
Have you had dealings with ship captains before this?
I suggest you can't be an authority on the strain of command... and thus, you may be completely wrong about Captain Queeg.
-Your witness.
-One minute, Doctor.
Council for defense has raised an interesting point.
In private practice, did you ever have patients... who had to deal with complicated command decisions-- men such as plant managers, industrialists, et cetera?
Yes.
Quite a few.
Including flyers who have to decide questions of life and death every day.
I've written a book on the subject.
In those cases, oould you detect where a neurosis... might damage the ability to make decisions at the right time?
Ahsolutely.
And in your examination of Commander Queeg... you found no such damage, right?
Absolutely right.
Thank you, Doctor.
That'll be all.
-Smart guy.
-He's sure gonna hear down on me.
And that's the way I saw it.
And that's the way I saw it.
I felt it was my duty as a naval officer.
Captain Oueeg was sick--mentally ill-- and I had to take over.
And honestly, if I had to do it again, I'd do it.
Thank you, Mr. Maryk.
Your witness, sir.
Mr. Maryk, just a few questions.
Would you say your grades in high school were average?
Lower than average.
-And in college?
-Lower than average.
What training have you had in psychiatry or medicine?
None.
Where did you get the idea that Captain Queeg was mentally if I?
-Out of books.
-What books?
Name the titles.
I can't remember.
Define schizophrenia.
I can't.
-What is a manic depressive?
-I don't know.
What's the difference between the words paranoid and paranoia?
I don't know.
You don't know what you're talking about when you discuss mental illness.
f didn't say I knew much ahout it.
You thought you knew enough to commit an act that was outright mutiny.
I wanted to save the ship.
But responsible doctors found that the captain wasn't mentally ill, right?
They weren't there.
Isn't the reverse possible?
Isn't it possible that under pressure you became erratic... and couldn't understand the captain's sound decision?
-It's possible--
-Between a captain and his officer... who is presumed by the navy to have better judgement in ship handing?
-The captain.
-One last question.
If the diagnosis of expert doctors is correct... then you're guilty as charged, aren't you?
Maybe so.
No more questions.
No further questions.
You may step down.
Take it easy.
You've just seen the first act.
The finale's still to come.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I assumed command of an extremely sloppy, badly handled ship.
I was determined to bring this ship in line.
Lieutenant Maryk opposed me from the very first.
Maybe he thought I was crazy to keep trying.
In your judgement, was your ship on the verge of foundering... when the executive officer assumed command?
Well, as you know... a typhoon is an extreme hazard at all times.
But the ship was riding well.
Lieutenant Maryk went into a panic and ran amuck.
He acted under the delusion that he alone could save the ship.
Ensign Keith--an unreliable and disloyal officer-- combined with him against me at this crucial time.
It was bad luck for them, really.
I bear them no malice.
I'm extremely sorry for them.
No more questions.
A word of caution before you proceed with the examination.
The court recognizes that the defense is compelled to challenge... the competence of Lieutenant Commander Oueeg.
Nevertheless, the requirements of legal ethics... and military respect remain in force.
Thank you.
Mr. Queeg, during a period when the Caine was towing targets... did you ever steam over your own towline and out it?
Objection.
I beg the court's indulgence.
The defense outrages the dignity of this proceeding.
The judge advocate wants the defense to switch to a guilty plea.
He thinks the report of the psychiatrist closes the case.
But it is up to you line naval officers, not doctors... to judge the captain's performance of duty.
I must review that performance for the navy to render a judgement.
Objection overruled.
Now, sir.
Did you ever steam over your own towline and out it?
Well, f for one am happy to dispose of this particular slander.
While we were towing the target, I noticed antiaircraft bursts close.
Naturally, I turned to avoid them.
And you continued to turn in a full circle.
My unreliable helmsman failed to warn me we were coming around 360 degrees.
I caught it in time and instantly reversed course.
To the best of my knowledge, we didn't steam over the towline.
I see.
Besides the antiaircraft bursts, did nothing else distract you?
Not that I recall.
Weren't you engaged in reprimanding a seaman named Dlugatch, at length... for caving his shirttail out, while the ship turned 360 degrees?
I reprimanded him, but that only took two seconds.
When the Caine escorted attack boats of marines to the beach... did your orders include dropping a yellow dye-marker?
I don't recall.
Did you drop one?
I don't recall.
Didn't you steam several hundred yards ahead of the attack boats... drop a dye-marker and retire at high speed... leaving the boats to make the beach on their own?
The question is abusive and flagrantly leading.
There oan be no more serious a charge to an officer than cowardice under fire.
May I make one thing clear?
It is not the defense's contention that Commander Queeg is a coward.
Quite the contrary.
The defense assumes no man who rises to command a naval ship can he a coward.
And therefore, if he commits questionable acts under fire... the explanation must he elsewhere.
You may resume.
You seem to be the victim of constantly disloyal officers.
Now, I didn't say that!
Only some of them were disloyal.
-Mr.
Keith and Mr. Maryk, for instance?
-Yes.
Mr. Queeg, this is a fitness report you wrote on Mr. Maryk.
July 1, 1944, one month before he relieved you.
Do you recognize it?
I do.
Would you mind reading your comments on Mr. Maryk?
I don't believe the court can hear you.
"This officer's improved since his last report.
He's consistently loyal, courageous, thorough and efficient.
He's recommended for transfer to the regular navy." I'd like to say that--
Thank you.
Did you ever turn your ship upside-down in search of a key that didn't exist?
I don't know what lies have been sworn to in this court.
I'd like to set you straight here and now!
A key did exist!
The witness is understandably agitated by this ordeal.
-I request a recess to give him--
-I don't want a recess!
I'll answer all questions right here and now.
-Did you conduct such a sear oh?
-Yes, I did.
As usual, my disloyal officers failed me, and the key couldn't be found.
In fact, wasn't this whole fuss over a quart of strawberries?
Pilfering food, in large amounts or small... is one of the most serious occurrences on board ship.
Didn't you learn the mess boys ate the strawberries... and your search was for an imaginary key?
I repeat!
The key was not imaginary!
And I don't know anything about mess boys eating strawberries.
Have you no recollection of a conversation with Ensign Harding... just prior to his leaving the Caine?
-What ahout it?
-Didn't he tell you they ate them?
All that f remember is that he was very grateful for his transfer.
His wife was ill in the states.
Do you know where Ensign Harding is now?
I have no way of knowing.
Ensign Harding is in San Diego.
His wife has fully recovered.
He's been summoned and can be flown up here in three hours, if necessary.
Would it serve any useful purpose to have him testify?
No, l--
I don't see any need of that.
Now that I recall-- he might have said something about mess boys, and he might not.
I questioned so many men, and Harding was not the most reliable officer.
I'm afraid the defense has no other recourse than to produce Ensign Harding.
There's no need for that!
He'll just tell you lies!
He was no different from any officer in the wardroom.
They were all disloyal!
I tried to run the ship hy the book, but they fought me at every turn.
If the crew wanted to walk around with shirttails hanging out, let them!
Take the towline-- defective equipment, no more, no less.
But they encouraged the crew to go around spreading wild rumors... about steaming in circles and then "Old Yellowstain."
I was to blame for Lieutenant Maryk's incompetence and poor seamanship.
Lieutenant Maryk was the perfect officer, but not Captain Oueeg.
But the strawberries!
That's where I had them.
They laughed at me and made jokes.
But I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt and with geometric logic... that a duplicate key to the icebox did exist.
I'd have produced that key if they hadn't pulled the Caine out of action!
I know now they were only trying to protect some fellow officer--
Naturally, I can only cover these things from memory.
If I've left anything out... just ask me specific questions... and I'll be glad to answer them... one by one.
No further questions, sir.
The court is closed.
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody oan deny
No, baby.
There are no girls here.
Just the officers of the Caine.
What, darling?
Steve, make 'em pipe down, will you?
Knock it off, fellows!
Old Willie's talking to his girl.
-Hi, Tom!
-Hello, Rabbit.
How are you?
Hello, Jim.
Hello, Tom.
I didn't think you'd have the guts to come around.
I didn't have the guts not to.
I wanna thank you for not telling the fellows ahout what happened.
I'm delighted at how things turned out.
Stow it.
It's over and done with.
Yeah.
You can take a plane tonight.
I'm getting a new ship and skipper, but we'll have time to get married!
We'll let my mother know afterwards.
Please, May.
I love you, darling!
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Steve, Tom!
That was May.
We're--
Well, well!
The officers of the Caine in happy celebration.
What are you, Barney?
Kind of tight?
Sure.
I got a guilty conscience.
I defended you, Steve, because I found the wrong man was on trial.
So I torpedoed Queeg for you.
I had to torpedo him.
And I feel sick about it.
Okay, take it easy.
You know, when I was studying law... and Mr. Keefer was writing his stories... and you, Willie, were tearing up the playing fields of Princeton... who was standing guard over this fat, dumb, happy country of ours?
Not us.
Oh, no!
We knew you couldn't make any money in the service.
So who did the dirty work for us?
Queeg did!
And other guys--tough, sharp guys who didn't crack up like Queeg.
No matter what, he endangered the ship and the lives of the men.
He didn't endanger anybody!
You did!
All of you!
You"re a fine bunch of officers.
You said your self he cracked.
I'm glad you brought that up, because that's a very pretty point.
I left out one detail in the court-martial.
It wouldn't have helped our case any.
After the Yellowstain business, Queeg asked for help... and you turned him down, didn't you?
Yes.
You didn't approve of his conduct.
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.
So you turned on him.
You ragged him.
You made up songs about him.
If you'd given Queeg the loyalty he needed... would the whole issue have come up in the typhoon?
You're an honest man, Steve.
I'm asking you.
Would it have been necessary for you to take over?
ft probably wouldn't have been necessary.
If that's true, then we were guilty.
You're learning, Willie!
You don't work with a captain because you like the way he parts his hair.
You work with him because he's got the job or you're no good!
Well, the case is over.
You're all safe.
It was like shooting fish in a barrel.
Now we come to the man who should have stood trial.
The Caine's favorite author.
The Shakespeare who's testimony nearly sunk us all.
-Tell 'em, Keefer.
-You go ahead.
You're telling it better.
You ought to read his testimony.
He never even heard of Captain Queeg!
Forget it.
Queeg was sick.
He couldn't help himself.
But you--you're real healthy.
Only you didn't have one-tenth the guts he had.
Except, I never fooled myself.
I'm going to drink a toast to you, Mr. Keefer.
From the beginning, you hated the navy... and then you thought of this whole idea.
You managed to keep your skirts starched and clean, even in the court-martial.
Maryk will always be remembered as a mutineer.
But you'll publish your novel.
You'll make a million bucks.
You'll marry a big movie star.
And for the rest of your life you'll five with your conscience.
If you have any.
Here's to the real author of the Caine mutiny.
Here's to you, Mr. Keefer.
If you wanna do anything about it, I'll be outside.
I'm a lot drunker than you are, so it'll be a fair fight.
-Good-bye, darling.
-Good-bye, Willie.
Attention on deck!
-Keith?
-Yes, sir?
Take her out.
Aye, aye, sir.
Single up all lines!
Stand by to cast off.
Whoa!
Don't forget to write me.
About banns, about the marriage and mainly about Lori.
Lori, poor girl.
- Did she ever complain?
- No.
Poet's girlfriend will promote to wife of bureaucrat.
Get out, now.
- Thanks heaven.
- Write soon.
And don't let Lori go out of the house.
- Look at him, what a handsome man.
- Yes, sure.
An archduke without adjutant and valet?
I don't believe that!
Alarm!
Alarm!
Alarm!
Withdrawal!
Stupid Kaspa!
Time yet to come?
Tomorrow's day?
Still, still some dream will time repay,
Or sleep too deep for dreaming?
Perhaps this life which here I live
Is but a sleep and dawn will give only another seeming?
Or that best rose, long longed-for here, that fruit the wide earth did not bear,
will dawn and death disclose?
Who knows?
Oh, no one knows.
No one knows.
No one knows.
Marinka...
Did I disappoint you?
- I gave my word, Marinka.
- To whom?
To myself.
A chaplet would come in handy.
With a little veil.
Kaska, be reasonable!
The people would make fun of me.
Wouldn't they, Leni?
Come on...
Oh man, your voice...
It's like your Daddy's...
You miss him, don't you?
I'm sure he misses me too.
His office is quite long way from here.
But Hynek is good-hearted man.
But I'm not sure if we match with each other.
Sometimes I have a feeling, Mr. Tyl, that all this poem writing
is making him a bit crazy.
Mr. Macha is a kind of poet who are very rare.
You are jealous of him, aren't you?
He's been rather jealous of me, actually.
Where did you leave the husband, Michal?
Lori...
Hynek is dead.
I entered the world, hoping that the my days will come up, golden as May.
Beautiful May passed, withered the bloom of spring;
The summer fire burns high, autumn, and winter after;
another spring comes on,
As time bears off the years on its unresting wing.
Hello, Jakub.
This bloke is drunk, my friend Zacharias.
He thinks we're...
He thinks we're standing on the stairs.
- Pepi!
- A bit to the right.
- Pepi!
It is a year since he asked Marenka to marry him...
Damn, I won't remember it.
Marenka.
He proposed to Marenka...
- Mr. Tyl.
- I'm off.
Please, Kaska.
- I'll be right back.
- Be so kind, take care of maiden Somkova.
- With pleasure.
Leave that kid alone, Hynek.
Who is that girl?
Lori's not for you.
Leni, I will bet you anything that this kid will fall in love with me before there's first curtain.
Well, it could happen, but it is not appropriate to make bets about this.
If you are really serious.
All the less, if you were just joking.
Please.
- May I?
- Thank you.
Drink a bit.
It will warm you pleasantly.
What's wrong?
You don't like me?
Yes...
Yes.
My nose is slightly crooked, though,
but this imperfection is compensated by my nicely arched forehead.
Isn't it?
What do you think?
Jenicek?
- Yes.
- Be so kind, would you?
Look, what it is causing down there.
Yes, I'll take a look.
Sure I will.
- You are born actor, Mr. Macha.
- Everybody is born for something.
And you, Kaska, you were born for tailoring.
So stick to it.
- But I really love drama.
- Then what to do with you, man?
When Mr. Tyl will need a role of tailor in his slapstick,
Leni will put in a good word for you.
- Sometimes I hate you, Hynek.
- I'd prefer something more serious.
You know, I showed off to my mother that I'm spending my time with you.
Now she can hardly wait to see me in a play.
She gave me three florins.
To make a contribution, if you wouldn't mind.
- Oh, you can't do that.
- Bravo, Kaska!
Director will get three florins and you'll get Romeo.
- That's not what I meant.
- Or would prefer something less demanding from our own production?
I'll fix it.
You shouldn't have done this to Kaska.
I don't understand why you are accepting people into our society who are not equipped to excel with nothing.
Did you do it to to impress maiden Somkova?
Snotty and prideful as Devil himself.
He'll play leading men.
There will be no courting, dear Zacharias.
The one who doesn't want to get married doesn't have to woo anyone.
- Didn't you propose?
Prompter:
To Marenka...
You're trying to tell I asked you to marry Marenka.
If I get married, I'll be goner.
Well...
It is a place where everybody must go...
Yes.
But my dear, I'll be dead right after the wedding night.
Have you lost your mind?
No, I haven't.
Dear former future father-in-law, on the contrary.
And that's why there will be no wedding.
Bravo!
Bravo, Kaska!
Bravo!
Kaska, forgive me those offensive things
I had recently said about you in public.
I behaved unreasonably and silly.
Right, Macha!
Bravo, Macha!
I'll do everything to deserve your friendship.
I mean really everything.
Don't be fool, Kaska.
As if you hadn't known Mr. Macha.
He's a poseur.
You don't understand me, Mr.Tyl.
Believe me, I feel sorry for you.
Each of us is heading different way.
You yourself have said, that the most different people follow different life paths to reach the common goal in the end.
Speak for yourself with your own words, not with mine against me.
Well, I don't know.
When they see you dressed like this, they will consider you to be an emissary from some God-forsaken place.
And then you'll end up in prison.
Don't laugh.
People can hear the grass growing, if they really want to.
- Come, Jenik.
Be my guest.
- Thanks.
And please, give him a good talking.
Tell him to keep studying instead of continuing with those "masterstrokes".
Far from it!
Mr. Macha knows for the best what to do.
All of this because of that Somkova girl.
Such girl.
Where did you lost your mind, Hynek?
My god, what's that she's wearing?
I knew it.
What did you tell them about me?
Our discussion with Mr. Tyl was honorable.
No word of you spoken.
- I went -- by chance...
- I don't like any chances.
Especially yours.
Lori, come with me.
- But you...
- Come with me already!
- I'm here with my mother.
- I'm telling you to come with me!
A bit of gallantry should be part of such uniform you have.
Don't you think?
That will be your task to do.
That's a bit too much.
What do you thinK?
Caprice, Mrs. Somkova.
Caprice and exhibition.
Look at it.
He's been dating the girl just several months and he's already bossing her.
When she's smiling, she's told to cry, when she's crying, she's told to smile.
Everything according to him.
Many times, he speaks in front of her about things
I've never heard in my life.
If he desired to have learned woman, he should have searched somewhere else.
She's not the type of girl who would need words of wisdom from him.
Why did you laugh so much?
No reason.
This coat suits you.
Don't you ever again listen to people, who say things about me to you.
Do it, if you like me at least a bit.
You mustn't like anyone.
Deep in the lake's heart drowned from sight.
But deeper, see, at the water's rim,
From a little window a lantern's gleam;
This night to vigil Vilem is giving:
Tomorrow sets him free from living.
His heavy guilt and yours he carries:
Deep your seducer's blood has stained him,
That stroke a parricide arraigned him.
You liked it, didn't you?
That's why you didn't resist.
I did.
Nothing would have happened, if you didn't want to.
I don't understand.
One can see a mile off, that you enjoy making love with men.
Not with everyone.
Only with you.
What do you mean?
Have you ever tried?
Have you or not?
How can you know you wouldn't enjoy it?
Oh my God, Hynek.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Bear for his guilt, and your own shame, my bitter curse, and the world's blame.
Bear for his guilt, and your own shame, my bitter curse, and the world's blame.
Sir.
Mr. Macha.
This is for you.
Excuse me.
What have you done to me this time?
I'll break your neck!
- Come here!
- Let go of me!
- This is round and round!
- Ouch!
Leave me alone!
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Ouch!
May I ask you, sir...
What do you want from her?
I don't know myself.
Such distinguished man.
And he keeps bothering immature whore.
Time yet to come?
Tomorrow's day?
Perhaps this life, which here I live,
Is but a sleep...
And dawn will give
Only another seeming?
Where do you know these words from?
I know everything you wrote.
My father brings me transcriptions of your poems.
I can't go anywhere by myself.
Yes.
That's exactly how I imagined you, while reading your poems.
Thank you for coming.
I don't meet anyone.
I'm still alone.
Only this Anezka's clock measures my time here.
Will you ever come again?
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
No.
I have no time.
I must travel to Krkonose.
I've never seen them.
I've never see mountains, nor trees.
I know all of this just from you.
- From your poems.
- I can't postpone this trip.
I gave my word.
To whom?
To myself.
You clouds, whou in your wandering course embrace like secret circling arm the earth her own course keeping, you dissolutions of stars, shades in the blue of heaven, you mourners ever to mutual sorrow given, who know so well the ways of silent weeping—
Bear you my charge, of all things that have birth.
where you pass from me on your long, wide way, to the distant shore, there for a moment stay, there, pilgrim clouds, greet reverently the Earth.
All this I know from you.
From your poems.
I see (famous bandit) Babinsky is here with you.
I always wonder if the smell comes from him or his filthy bitch.
Do you know him?
Who is it?
Vasek Kumr, gruesome lord of woods.
He ambushed carmens' wagons with bunch of cutthroats called Kumrs.
Jakub!
And sometimes even postal wagons.
They say he spent half of his life in the prison of Spilberk castle, with Babinsky.
If someone is rogue, their roguery must be worth it.
For every prominent villain always manages to slip away unhurt.
And the weak ones take the rap for them.
All the forests in their station, sound the great, sad accusation:
"They have slain him— slain him!
—slain him—!"
At the markets, people sing songs about Kumr.
Because he has killed many people.
Even one member of my family was a murderer.
But nobody ever wrote anything about him.
And he was parricide!
Cousin from mother's branch of our family, his name was the same as yours.
There are lot of people named Macha.
But he wasn't Macha, but Hynek.
Schiffner, after his father.
He killed him with a hoe.
In a hop garden.
Why did he do it?
No rason?
Because of woman.
What else.
Father didn't let his son marry the girl he liked, because he himself was in love with her.
Hynek was raised in the God's fear.
On Sundays, he used to play organ at the masses.
And in the end - he whacked him!
One blow with a hoe... and suddenly you are a murderer.
- Was he sentenced?
- Yes, he pleaded guilty.
After that, he was waiting three months for the execution.
- Did they hang him?
- They broke him upon the wheel.
I wasn't there.
But people said it was mockery.
The worst must have been those three months before execution.
The waiting for death.
Something like that cannot be possibly described.
You think?
Hey!
Do you need a lift?
There's still one free space.
Deep silence.
From the streaming wall flows down a small, slow river, and echoing drops the silence fret;
through the long cell their hollow fall, measuring night's moments of regret.
There never—never— never an and.
From death that passes not away...
Who shall my soul deliver?
Unending silence—never a sound—
Unending space, night, time, surround.
The dead mind dreaming on decay—
Mere nothingness—for ever!
And I to nothing—but one more day, and I to nothing am cast away.
Let me help you, ma'am.
Oh my god, why are you here with that child?
I came here to impetrate Heaven for him.
Here?
Are you a heathen that you don't know?
We've been doing this for ages.
A day before funeral.
Otherwise he wouldn't go in heaven.
Go away, leave us here.
Leave us alone!
Off you go!
Go away!
Go already!
She's been expecting you.
Perhaps this life which here I live, is but a sleep and dawn will give only another seeming?
Who knows?
Or that best rose, long longed-for here, that fruit the wide earth did not bear,
will dawn and death disclose?
Oh, no one knows.
A girl destinated to die can't disappoint anyone no more.
Listen to my advice.
Get her out of your head.
You didn't even know her.
That's everything he had on himself?
Everything, Mister Commissioner.
"The untuned harp, whose strings distil no more delights,
the deeds of time gone by, quenched starlight overhead,
heresy's pilgrimage, the loving, lovely dead..."
What is it supposed to mean?
Poetry.
This is supposed to be poetry?
To me, it is some sort of cipher message.
Carbonari?
Who's the author of these verses?
I am.
Can you prove it?
Perhaps by the fact that I intend to publish them with my name on the book jacket.
Don't make me laugh, boy.
No one will publish this.
Nowhere.
Oh, they will.
- You are in Prague already?
- Hello.
Where should I be instead?
I thought you were still on the road, after you hadn't showed up.
I bet you didn't miss me much.
You sure can easily amuse yourself.
With the others.
Me?
What are you thinking?
!
I hope you again fell in love with somebody here.
And I hope it was as easy as it was in my case.
Believe me, please.
I'm seeing nobody.
- Not even before.
- Can you prove it?
Hynek, please...
Don't.
Someone might see us.
People might see us.
So let them!
Not here...
We're going to have a child.
A child?
Your child.
Hynek.
Your child.
You sure about that?
Are you sure it's mine?
Trojan, that's like him.
He arranges an audience and then he leaves us freezing.
- Whether he's coming or not...
- His Majesty Lord censor.
Jan Nepomuk Zimmermann resides there.
Almost in heaven.
In order to be properly detached.
- Where have you been so long?
- I was trying to get this.
This is a real key to the heaven's door.
It's easy to fool around when you don't worry about anything.
- Oh I do.
I worry about you.
You better go see him without me.
- I am a raven who brings bad luck.
- Karel, pray for us.
Dear St. Jan of Nepomuk, please protect these boys.
The main purpose of my poem is a celebration of spring nature.
In the first number, for example, there's calm and pensive nature
in contrast to unbridled love of human beings...
Venerable consistorial councillor, we presume that it is high time to start fixing people's minds.
Because unlike these days, some time ago Prague used to be rather free from godlessness and immorality.
That's why in the works of my friend, the speciosity of human actions is potrayed by lively colours.
Plus, there is condign punishment in this work.
It is just a preachy novel, actually.
A novel pervaded by the faith in God.
The same faith, by which are pervaded even your remarkable works, if you pardon my frankness...
Venerable consistorial councillor, let me ask you
for kindly putting your signature on your book.
I read it very often.
And if there's your personal signature in it,
I will appreciate it doubly.
You own my book about Saint Jan of Nepomuk?
I hope you are aware of the fact, that it is a very rare copy nowadays.
Of course.
Here, if you can.
Thank you very much.
What are we gonna do with this?
The dead mind dreaming on decay—
Mere nothingness—for ever!
And I to nothing—but one more day, and I to nothing am cast away.
Where did you find a faith in this book?
The most important is that the blest Jan Zimmermann of Nepomuk found it.
Isn't it?
Have you talked to the publisher yet?
No.
I've decided to publish May by myself.
My own printing.
I won't let those tricky printers gouge me.
- Rozinka?
- Yes?
I'll be right there.
How much will it cost you?
Printer Spurny wants three florins per quire.
So the total cost is?
- Around 44 florins.
- It's pretty much.
Do you have the money?
I've got something.
I have some friends, too.
I hope they'll lend me some.
And there's pawn shop, too.
Come here, Lori.
Excuse me.
You aren't jealous of Roza, are you?
We're celebrating.
Look.
Wait...
Here it is...
Imprimatur.
Stow it.
Stow it, I said.
I won't let you ruin the most beautiful day of my life.
My mother died.
I love a flower because it withers.
an animal, because it perishes.
I love a man, because he dies and exists no more, because he feels that he vanishes for good.
I love...
No, more than love...
I worship God.
Since he does not exist.
She never liked me, am I right?
- She didn't.
- And yet you are praying for her.
Well, it is my mother.
If you really care about her redemption, repeat my words.
I swear by bright remembrance of my mother...
I swear...
I swear by bright remembrance of my mother my fidelity to you, always and in any case.
As it has been until now.
As it has been until now!
Why you didn't say "As it has been until now"?
Are you scared to swear it?
- Why would I be scared?
- You should know that.
That's why you're hesitating.
I wasn't the only one you loved, was I?
No, you were the only one!
Did you sleep around with the others?
- God knows who's the father of the child, am I right?
- Hynek, for God's Sake!
- Whose is the child?
- Don't yell!
- Whose?
- Don't yell!
- Why are you tormenting me so much?
- You are tormenting me!
Why don't you believe me?
I'll swear anything you want, Hynek.
You know that.
Everything I want.
I'm using brand new letters for you.
Thy're being used in the printing for the first time.
Get your paw off it.
Are your hands clean?
The paper.
Help me.
You need still hands, boy.
- I said it.
It's blurry.
- Never mind.
I'll keep this sheet as keepsake.
Turn it over.
The title is very important.
Maybe this will bring you luck.
His poem is piece of crap, which has fallen into the flowers right from the inactive volcano.
We can and we do have a liking for flowers.
However, as mentioned before, it shouldn't be inside cold and dead meteorite which was thrown out from torn bowels.
This is my question:
Why a young man, talented mind, dwells over a wheel and execution?
And yet I would like to hear dark sounds of his harp to resonate in a different way.
In a different way, as long as we live.
Not in that non-Czech way.
If Mr. Macha would be so kind and give us a second edition of his dreams in the second edition of his book...
Bugger him.
A few stupid reviews cannot upset you, can they?
Of course not.
But this won't earn my living and I'm getting married.
- Did you think it over, Hynek?
- There's nothing to think over.
When my girl eats, she feeds two people.
Everlasting, dead nothing!
I'll have a child.
A son.
My uncle.
You know him, don't you?
No.
Well...
He's searching for an assistant to his notary's office.
But it is... you know...
- It is too far.
- Where?
Well, it is far as...
Well, that's too far.
In Litomerice.
Is it true?
I swear by this saintess.
If those noble patriots do not like my May, if it is just a trash to them, a trash right from the inactive volcano,
which has fallen into the flowers, well then... adieau, dear Prague.
Farewell!
- Look at him, what a handsome man.
- Yeah, sure.
An archduke without adjutant and valet?
- I don't believe that.
- He's right.
Hello.
How come you want such exorbitant price for this?
For this?
For a couple of worn-out lines?
You are leeches, tricksters and thieves.
You have received payment order corresponding to valid rates.
Who do you think I am?
A thief or what?
- I raise money honestly.
- That sounds nice, Mr. Ledvina.
- Particularly when you say it.
- What is it you don't like about profession?
If you think that
I have soft and easy living as an executioner and a knacker, do it instead of me.
We'll see what knacker and executioner you will be like.
What's going on here?
Mr. Ledvina thinks it is a good idea to attack our office, because...
Because you're bunch of crooks!
Because he refuses to pay a scale fee for our legal work.
You are paid for every scumbag you hang, too.
I'll hang you with pleasure and for free.
You bastard!
Thief!
Would you please open the door?
If he hurts himself or breaks his legs, we're in trouble.
Who are you anyway?
- Hynek Macha.
- Macha...
I see.
Well, that was a great introduction.
Welcome aboard.
Your services will be beneficial for this office.
- Mr. Lorenc?
- Yes?
I've heard you have some free rooms in here.
I have to ask my wife about it.
Well, can I view them at least?
Wait for my wife.
I don't have a key.
When she'll be back?
She went only to miller's.
I'll give you an advice.
Praise her for something, when she's back.
That it is clean here, for example.
Or praise her for her flowers.
- This kind of stuff.
- Yes.
A woman likes to hear these things from strangers.
- It's not the same when I say it.
- You talk rubbish, old geezer!
- Mrs. Lorencova, right?
- So what?
I heard you're offering an apartment to let.
Maybe.
It's up to Lorenc.
Well come on.
- These flowers are very nice, Mrs. Lorencova.
- They're not mine.
They're Lorenc's
Melnik.
And Doksany, out there.
And Svaty Hanzburek.
Well?
Do you want it?
Yes, I want.
I do.
Of course, Mrs. Lorencova.
But...
Can you get me a bed, at least?
Just for starters, until we move in with my wife.
You're married?
Yes.
- Is she from Prague, too?
- Yes.
Is professor Knoll still lecturing?
He teached us Austrian law.
Professor Kleinwächter teaches civil and property law.
And what about professor Wenzel Ritter von Kopetz?
Can we not talk about the law while eating, for a change?
Mea culpa, mea culpa.
- I've heard you're married, Mr. Macha.
- Yes.
- Is it a long time?
- Not long.
- Why didn't you take your wife with you?
First, I have to set things up.
We're expecting a baby.
Soon?
Just these days.
You'll be young father.
I bet your wife is very young and pretty and rich, isn't she?
What a pity.
As a graduated lawyer from Prague, you would have found very advantageous relationships here.
But I love her.
I mean my wife.
Yes, we all do.
At least in the beginning, right?
I'm looking forward to meet you wife.
It's just a few steps.
You gotta handle it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.
Where's Hynek?
Why he's not here?
I am here.
You'll stay here with me, won't you?
Say you will stay, Hynek.
I'll stay Lori, don't be scared.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything, Hynek.
Hynek...
Out of heaven a star falls questing
Dying through the wastes of space
Endlessly it falls unresting
Through its endless resting-place.
Is there then no end of dying?
Nowhere—never an end of death.
Nobody's child but mine could have so sad eyes.
Mine.
Thank you for son.
We've been expecting you since afternoon.
I know.
I thought I would take a ride, but nobody went around.
Why are you doing this, for God's sake?
You're killing yourself.
I must leave in the morning.
Mr. Justiciary has no idea I travelled to Prague.
How long the night, on me a longer closes—
Away, thought!
Horror shuts from sight, the grave his thought discloses.
Deep silence.
Once again the chime of slow drops falling metes out time.
Rest for a while.
You look tired.
We have first banns on Wednesday.
I'm not sure if Mr. justiciary lets me go.
I told him we're already married.
We discussed everything I needed to know.
Now tell me the name of the groom.
Karel Hynek Macha.
- Birthdate?
- November 16th, 1810.
1810.
- Birthplace?
- Prague.
Na Ujezde Street, No. 400.
- Domiciled at the same address?
- Now it is Cattle Market.
- No. 551.
- Somewhere near Saint Ignatius church.
- Right accros the church.
- Father owns a mill shop there.
- What's his name?
- Antonin Macha.
- Mother's name?
- Marie Anna, born Kirchnerova.
Marie Kirchnerova.
How long do you know the bride?
Two years now.
I can see you are very young, both of you.
What about your parents?
Do they approve your marriage?
It is not him!
He's his brother.
- You're not a groom?
- I'm not.
- Well where is he?
- In Litomerice.
Don't make a fool out of me!
Why a groom cannot come by himself?
This way, you could marry him to someone against his will.
Hynek wasn't able to come, Your Worship.
He had to stay in Litomerice.
In his office.
Well, he should get married in Litomerice.
Without banns, there's no wedding.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Seven florins, please.
- Seven?
- You think it's not enough?
Even five would be too much for this.
Mister, the river's length remains the same, no matter if you carry a jamjar or wagon of xcoal.
Ok, than.
- But I'll need your help.
- Alright.
The untuned harp, whose strings distil no more delights,
the deeds of time gone by, quenched starlight overhead,
heresy's pilgrimage, the loving, lovely dead...
Why don't you write about something funnier?
- That's what is my wife telling me too.
- Is she?
Our intentions are good, I guess.
I don't understand why at the end of your poem, a turtle-dove calls your name together with the name of that highwayman and that sinful selfmurderer.
It's hard to explain.
I like to read about love, but not every love has to be unlucky.
Aren't you angry at me because I was honest?
Tomorrow afternoon, at about 3 p.m., I'll be on the island with my daughter.
Maybe we'll meet there.
Are you already familiar with Litomerice?
Yes, I am.
See you the pilgrim there, hastening on his quest through the long, sunset fields,
beneath the dimming west?
Strain your eyes as you will, the end you cannot see, as over the edge of vision he falters and finds no rest.
Never--
- Albertina!
...Ah, never.
I'm coming, mom.
And this is all life offers me.
Who comforts me?
What charm this heart can move?
Love is without an end!
And bitter is my love!
Let's form a chain, people.
A chain!
Hurry up!
Pass it to me, come on!
Next!
There's nothing to safe.
It will burn to the grounds.
Follow me, people!
Line up!
Pass it, come on!
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
The one you threw down the stairs.
- Will you do it again?
- I'll think it over.
Who the hell is it?
Climb down!
Don't do it again if there's another fire in the future.
Realize, that our home lies just about 100 metres from those barns.
Imagine what would happen if our archive caught on fire.
Official records are much more important for our town than threshed straw of some cottager.
Of course, Mr. justiciary.
I have no intention to offend you, young man.
However, it seems to me that you're not aware of present time you live in.
And that's something really bad for our profession.
There's no 'present time' for me.
Since there's no such moment at which life would stop.
There's only the past and the future.
There are only things that were, and things that will be.
In my case, only the future is important.
I take it as a dream.
And everything I do,
I do for the future.
Is your place as cold as mine, Lori?
No, it's not.
Michal lit the stove.
Come to my place.
I am afraid to ask about my son.
I know that you would tell me if Ludvicek was feeling good already.
He's fine.
He's completely healthy.
He himself wants to be breastfed.
We don't have to force him.
Michal laughs at him because he drinks like he was a Piarist.
Michal.
Michal, again.
Can't you be alone for a while?
I'm alone too
and I have to stand it.
If you were here with me,
Justiciary's family would have invited us for lunch.
Last time, they gave me flank of pork which lasted at least for two days.
Today, they had a rabbit with cream sauce.
With cranberries.
Be quiet or I get hungry.
I can see all the vineyards in the Elbe Valley.
When ships cruise around, their bunting flutters near my windows.
They carry coal.
And I am almost cold.
I'll come to you soon.
I've packed everything I need.
- Clothes, dishes...
- Don't forget a mirror.
What else do you need?
A hatchet and a coal scuttle.
A shovel.
And a candlestick.
And some other home stuff.
An iron, too.
And clotheslines.
Mr. Macha.
Mr. Macha!
He might took the disease with him from Prague.
He has visited Prague much more often than we thought.
Several people had died of it in Prague.
We have to be hopeful.
But even if he hadn't suffered from cholera, people in this town would spread the word of suspicion and no one will come to our office anymore.
I fear that he had infected one of us, during his visits at our home.
There's nothing I have done without your knowledge.
Lori, how... dare you... act against my instructions?
Do you want to ruin everything?
It's easy.
I'll leave Litomerice.
He's there with someone.
If you act against my instructions again...
- I think it is a girl!
- A weird get-rich-quck.
Until I come to Prague, you're forbidden from leaving my room.
If you betray me,
I swear by my life, you won't see me ever again.
I'll swear anything you want, Hynek.
You know that.
I've heard someone's being ill in here.
Is it you?
A long way awaits you.
You need to be prepared for it.
There, pilgrim clouds, greet reverently the Earth.
Ah, well-beloved earth, beautiful Earth,
My cradle and grave, the womb that gave me birth, my sweet, sole land,
Ah, vast and single, of beauty as of worth.
He didn't stayed inside much long.
What to talk about when you live in peace with the others and with yourself.
The last indignant thoughts of the defeated dead, their unremembered names, the clamour of old fights, the worn-out northern lights, after their gleam is fled,
the untuned harp, whose strings distil no more delights, the deeds of time gone by, quenched starlight overhead,
heresy's pilgrimage, the loving, lovely dead,
The deep forgotten grave, eternal board and bed;
the smoke of burned-out fires, the scattered bell's chime— like the song of dead swam, like Eden snatched away,
So is my childhood time.
But what of following time?
My youth, alas, my youth.
My season and song are May!
Light laughter on the lips, deep grief in the heart's core.
[Castillo] After I pick up Acosta and meet Levec, we go to the drop.
[Crockett On Phone] How are you gonna give us the location?
There's no way I'll be able to do that.
Lieutenant, I ought to be making the meet.
Acosta's Colombian.
He doesn't trust Anglos.
It has to be me.
[Car Door Opens, Closes] Right on the button, Melendez.
Very impressive.
I'm not here to impress you.
I'm here to take care of my interests.
And my only concern is to make sure that Levec's goods are delivered properly.
And you are not in this meeting to sidestep me with the old man, okay?
I'm in this meeting to take care of my cocaine, not worry about your career moves.
Levec is a first-class guy, man.
You gonna see that tonight.
It's all taken care of.
Good.
Impress me.
It's healthier for you.
Vamos, Pepe.
[Helicopter Whirring]
[Grunts]
Don't talk to me about time again.
[Scoffs] Por favor, da me un break.
Six minutes never killed anybody, you know.
I can kill 20 men in six minutes.
[Speaking Spanish] This merchandise will be worth waiting for.
[Projectile Whistling]
[Machine Gun Fire]
[Gunfire Continues]
My God, how'd you like to be Acosta and have to tell Levec that you lost the whole load?
The old man may not give Acosta a second chance.
- Nothing on the chopper.
- Well, who were those guys, ghosts?
- They were pros.
- Dead commando's prints paid off.
John Lockdam, 35-year-old vet, long-range reconnaissance.
He was a LRRP?
You're lucky you got out at all.
Guy was a Miccosukee Indian.
Call Washington and see if there's any other LRRPs living in South Florida.
- Go down and, uh, see if you can catch 15 minutes with Sergeant Pine over at Metro.
- He's a Seminole.
See if he can help us out on this.
Cool.
Uh-oh, Commander Pursley's coming.
Oh, Lieutenant, you have a moment?
Yeah.
Martin, if it wasn't a problem, I wouldn't have come down here.
The department has always backed your level of involvement, but to have you out there—
I appreciate your concern, Lieutenant.
I really do.
So, who's running O.C.B.
Crockett's in charge and it stays that way... until I put Levec and Acosta out ofbusiness.
Don't get yourself killed.
I'd hate to replace you.
We scored big against the white man today, boys.
John Lockdam died for the glory of our people.
His family would be proud.
We found this amulet on a dead commando.
Does this mean anything?
It's Miccosukee.
You can buy imitations of'em at the Big Cypress Reservation.
You ever hear of any involvements in drug runners down there?
No, have you in the black community?
[Laughing]
Come on, Sergeant.
No, I'm not kidding.
It couldn't happen out there.
Why not?
People adhere to the old values.
They wouldn't allow it.
They pretty much stayed to themselves out there in the swamps until ChiefJumper took over.
He sort of allowed the white man in to buy souvenirs, play bingo and watch alligator wrestling.
He's the man to see.
I really appreciate your time, ChiefJumper.
I was wondering if I could talk to somebody on the reservation about Miccosukee life, maybe gain some insights into modern-day practices.
Sideshows aren't in depth enough?
No, not for my purpose.
Oh, a reporter?
No, actually, I'm doing research on my doctoral thesis.
"Oppression in the Land of the Free."
We get one about every three, four years that want to carry that same torch.
Unfortunately, none ever had the in-depth or the understanding to do it right.
That's interesting.
The best way to learn about a people, Mr. Cooper, is to immerse yourself in our way of life.
Do you have any suggestions?
Becky Wells, she can best explain the difference between your world and ours.
She's lived in both long enough to gain some insight.
She works for us.
Thanks.
[Levec] I am absolutely appalled of the laxity of my security.
Let's just be grateful that you survived so that we can continue doing business.
[Castillo] My survival is gonna cost you, Mr. Levec.
You can understand that, I'm sure.
Sir, about this Indian thing— Yes, Anthony.
It's gotten completely out of control.
I think that they have to be disciplined, like children.
Like children, Anthony?
Do you know that they have totally disrupted any type of a schedule that I've tried to establish?
We're at least two months behind.
How does, uh—
Mr. Melendez, how does that affect our distribution deal?
The delays are costing you approximately 20% of your established lines.
If they continue,
I'm gonna lose a lot of money.
Hmm, I understand.
Sir, I have a major drop happening tomorrow afternoon.
Please, do you think I can pull this thing off with whatever means are necessary?
Violence is a precious commodity, Anthony.
You've yet to learn that.
Yes, sir.
But this time it's justified.
Stop.
Don't.
Mr. Melendez, can we depend upon your services for this next drop?
Yes, if you can guarantee me his security arrangements.
[Chuckles] You have my word, Mr. Melendez.
Anthony, you will have no further interruption.
Can I just— If there is, I'll take it personally.
Well, that's, uh— that's about all.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Mr. Melendez.
Acosta's setting up for another drop.
Are you anywhere?
[Tubbs] Nothing much.
No one seems to be hiding anything.
Acosta said something about the Indians.
It's possible Levec has made arrangements for the Miccosukee.
I don't know.
ChiefJumper, he's a pretty straight arrow.
Out for the good of his people, just got a clinic built, that kind of thing.
Somebody had to tell those commandos about the deal at the Bowl.
What about the chief?
I can't believe he's a player.
Sell the coke and give the money to the tribe.
That's one way to do it.
Stay close to the phone.
Get ready to move and watch your back.
Right, Lieutenant.
[Dial Tone]
[Woman] And that was the way it was with the Miccosukee.
Ten years ago, we were completely dependent on the federal government.
Now, more than half our revenue comes from our own ventures:
The bingo halls, the sale of tax-free cigarettes.
We also built our own baseball field.
All without help from Washington.
Are there any questions?
[Man] Excuse me, may I say something?
You should be very happy with what Washington give you.
Many people would give anything to come over here, you know.
Well, since we were here and all of South Florida was our land, we don't feel Washington gave us anything.
Thank you for visiting Big Cypress.
You've been a wonderful group.
[Muttering]
Ah, excuse me, Becky Wells?
Mr. Cooper?
Yes.
Uh, the chief said to expect an academic, but—
Well, you can't tell a book by looking at the cover.
Uh, would you mind if I talk to you?
Many of our men saw the military as an opportunity.
Many of them became disillusioned, so they came back and went native.
Why was that?
Well, other than this, many of them still live the traditional way.
A lot of the young people emulate them.
It's a very positive thing.
How about you?
Well, I just work on trying to keep the white man aware of our world to understand it.
So what do you think?
Oh, wow.
It's beautiful.
It's my home.
Come with me.
There's more, lots more.
[Woman On P.A.] I'd like to welcome all of you to the Miccosukee Indian Village.
The first stunt that Tommy will be doing is opening the alligator's mouth.
The alligator has 80 teeth, 40 on top and 40 on the bottom.
And he does not have a tongue, but they do have what is called a palate.
So what do you call this?
Survival.
Tommy will next be performing what is called bulldogging.
Yeah, survival.
That means he will be putting the alligator's chin under his own chin.
Who's that guy over there?
That's the chief's son.
He'd be a good interview, ifhe'll talk to you.
[Woman On P.A.] Seven and a half feet long, and weights approximately 275 pounds.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- These animals live to be 75 to 100 years old.
And they are raised domestically— Be careful, Tommy— here in Florida.
The next stunt Tommy is going to do is to put the animal to sleep... by gently rubbing his stomach.
[Applause]
What happens Is the blood rushes to the alligator's brain... and because the brain is small, it puts it to sleep.
Tommy will make the gator mating call, which will wake up the gator.
[Hissing]
As you can now see, the alligator is quite alert and very active.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's our show for today.
I'd like to thank all of you for coming to the Miccosukee Indian Village.
I hope you enjoyed the show.
Thank you again.
[Chuckles] Amazing.
[Levec] And how was your trip into the city?
Not bad.
It was all right.
Ah, lovely, lovely.
Splendid.
Uh, there are some— there are some things I want to talk to you about, Chief.
Some of your people do not have a sense of business acumen.
That's okay.
I understand that.
But some of your people who do, do not know the meaning of our arrangement, and frankly, that, uh— that troubles me.
I don't understand.
Business warranties are sacred to me.
I've— I've been generous to your people.
Gymnasiums, libraries, medical facilities, food, cash.
The rich can well afford to be generous, Mr. Levec.
There's no way back, Chief.
I invested in your authority.
I expect you to maintain control over your braves.
Otherwise, I cannot be held accountable for the peccadillos of my associates.
[Switek] Well, I'm getting tired sitting around here waiting for it to snow.
We may have a cold front moving in.
Here's the D.O.D. List on ex-LRRPs in Dade County.
[Tubbs] Have they all got the same address?
Yeah, the reservation.
All lethal commando trained, courtesy of Uncle.
Two of'em are qualified to fly Hueys.
They look good for the job in the Bowl.
Recognize any of the names?
Yeah, Joe Dan Jumper.
He's the chief's son.
He runs some kind of, uh, back-to-nature boot camp deep in the Glades.
But I don't see him as a snowman.
What do you see him as?
- I don't know.
- Trudy, I want you to call the marine commandant's office.
Get a full service jacket on these guys— psych profiles, the works.
It's gonna take some time.
When's the next load due?
Soon.
Gleason's got a job coming in.
It's gonna be in the water.
Keep an eye on your buddy, Joe Dan.
He may make a move on the load.
Keep in touch with me.
You can get me on the cellular.
You sold us out for the white man's drug money.
Why?
For the good of the tribe.
You know that.
Not the whole tribe.
The vast majority supported me.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be too sure about that either.
If I'd talked to my father the way you speak to me, he'd have skinned me alive.
In the old days, they had respect for the chiefs.
Would your father have misled the tribe to make this devil's bargain?
He'd have made it in his day to save our people.
Yeah, well, your father earned the respect.
That's more than I can say about you.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Oh, that was fantastic.
You're not the first, you know.
What do you mean, I'm not the first?
You're not the first academic who's tried to use us to get research money.
Aw, come on, Becky.
You think I came down here to score a Guggenheim?
- Well, why are you here?
- That's what I'd like to know.
For 400 years, the white man's exploited us for our land.
It's ironic that a black man would come down here, exploit us for a book.
Hey, be cool, brother man.
You're carrying a boulder on your shoulders.
Why don't you just loosen up?
Loosen up?
While Washington cuts our subsidies and Tallahassee cuts our water rights?
You wanna know what's loose?
The screw in my father's head for letting an outsider like you get this close.
You think you're the only people of color... who have to crawl on their knees in this country?
You give me a little Trail ofTears and I'll give you a Little Rock.
For every Indian massacred, I'll give you a lynching.
You had Custer.
We've got the Klan.
What's the difference?
What are you saying?
I'm saying that you don't have a monopoly on suffering.
I'm black, you're red.
To the white man, we're both colored.
Simple as that.
We're both outsiders in the white man's country.
What do you really want?
Like I told Becky,
I want to see what the Miccosukees are about.
I'd like to get to know you.
[Chuckling]
Where I live, you wouldn't last an hour without your Cadillac.
Try me.
Today.
It's happening today.
Acosta, you told me you'd give me 24 hours notice.
Sí, chico.
But that was then, this is now.
Where?
Everglades, by Big Cypress.
Thirty keys de lo mejor, top-shelf.
Hmm.
?
Por qué no?
W-What's the matter?
- It's Miccosukee country.
- Man, you're the tough guy, Melendez.
What are you, scared of the swamps now?
I'm not stupid, Acosta.
They took you out once already.
Now you're on their turf.
You don't got a chance against the Indians.
Oyeme, if Injun Joe tries to pull that same stunt again, we got enough firepower to blow him clean into the happy hunting ground.
[Spanish] I understand, man.
I'm gonna pass.
Melendez, uh, if you stay,
I make it five points per key.
Piensalo.
Cinco puntos, mi socio.
In or out?
- I'm in.
- Perfecto, perfecto.
Okay, uh, we'll pick you up on the docks near the MacArthur... at 4:00.
Don't be late, okay?
Pepe.
[Spanish]
[Ringing]
[Line Ringing]
No, not since this morning.
[Castillo] He has to be warned.
The deal's set in the Glades.
Joe Dan interferes, Acosta's planning to restage the massacre at Wounded Knee.
Lieutenant, let me go out there.
I can get word to Tubbs.
No.
I need you at the base.
That's an order.
So, uh, where were we going?
Yachting.
This is how we deal with the so-called advantages of civilization, Mr. Cooper.
You're gonna make some alligators very jumpy.
[Joe Dan] Better the gators than the schoolkids.
[ManSingingPop]

[No Audible Dialogue]

[Vocalizing]
[Fades]
I guess he's trying to create a tribal utopia— the old ways, love for the land.
[Scoffs] Mining the swamps with claymores?
Sounds more like Haiphong Harbor revisited.
What?
Well, he didn't exactly cop to laying the mines.
It was more like, uh, you know, "Watch this."
Plus, he dumped the load.
The guy dumps 30 keys into the swamps?
Man, that gives new meaning to "Just say no."
Why?
That's what we do.
Yeah, but we get paid for it.
Well, like I said, the chief thinks that taking the drug money helps the tribe.
Joe Dan, he thinks that it...
poisons their minds.
Where are the D.O.D. Files?
Trudy's pulling them off the fax right now.
Trudy.
All right, all right.
I'm doing the best I can.
Just got it.
Okay, Silver Star.
Two bronze medals.
This guy's a damn hero.
Wait a minute.
It says here he was war wounded in Grenada.
Went to a V.A. Hospital in Hawaii, and six months later, he was discharged on a Section 8.
Trudy, check with the V.A. Hospital.
See where he's been since then.
Right.
Tubbs, check out his agenda.
The truth:
Before we built the clinic, the elder and sick suffered greatly for lack of medical attention.
Death stared at us daily.
Our pains and agony were constant.
Alcohol and child abuse was rampant.
Our infant mortality rate was 15— 20% higher than the American national average.
Wake up!
What's the point of—
[Joe Dan] Just chill.
It's okay.
We wish the elders no disrespect.
And we applaud the builders of the health clinic.
But this pandering to drug pushers will only result in greater pain and suffering for our people.
And when payment is due on the tribal construction loan?
Then we'll do as we've always done.
Stop living a fool's dream.
You want to live off roots and berries, go ahead.
It's better than living off the white man's vices.
We already peddle duty-free cancer sticks and legalized gambling.
What the hell difference does it make?
If the white man wants to kill himself with drugs, let him.
We only lease him the land.
That's only half the truth.
Tell them!
We've already gone through all of this.
First they rent, and then they own us.
You saw them.
They treated you like a slave.
Is that the kind of world that we want to bring our infants into?
Let's put it in a vote.
The council members have already voted, and that is it.
Is that true?
Then we'll deal with the pushers on our own terms.
And jeopardize the life of every tribal member?
You did that, Chief.
Hey, wait a minute, man.
Where you going?
To protect my people.
You're gonna start a bloodbath.
I'm trying to prevent one.
By taking the law—
The law into my own hands.
That's right.
You're starting to sound like my father, Cooper.
Well, maybe your father... is right about some things, huh?
What about Little Rock and Selma, Cooper?
You folks broke the law of the land for a higher good, right?
Civil disobedience doesn't include blowing people up.
Yeah, well, the times, they are a-changin'.
Your organization has been the envy of so many for so long, but yet—
Now, now, internal management is a... rather difficult fence to walk at times.
We have a lot of money and a lot of time invested in this interest.
But yet you insist on handing it to Acosta.
Oh, a terrible, terrible, bad judgment on my part.
L-I just don't know why I decided to give him a second chance.
You know, where I come from, the term "second chance" doesn't exist.
[Chuckling] There's your reputation for efficiency.
Very good.
That's why we're doing business together.
I don't see business.
I see Indians.
I don't see business.
I guarantee you next time will be different.
I won't deal with Acosta.
Don't let Acosta concern you.
Excuse me.
Senor Acosta.
Levec's cutting his expenses.
He's also cleaning house.
The chief may be next.
[Tubbs] And Joe Dan's about to go on the warpath.
What's our move?
Switek's on his way back from the D.A. Office.
I wanna see if we have enough to move on Levec.
I'll send Becky Wilson back to the chief's house and have them meet atJoe Dan's camp.
Maybe I can get them to talk and reduce the body count.
Can you trust her?
Don't have much choice, but yeah, I do.
Keep me informed.
Yeah, uh, Lieutenant.
It's not enough.
The D.A. Has no proof Levec actually stuffed Acosta in the tank.
So everybody's a free agent.
They get to have their little war.
Let's go home.
Chief!
ChiefJumper.
Where's Joe Dan?
Becky, what happened?
Where is he?
I don't know.
He's in some private place.
Apparently, it's some big secret.
Well, that's just great.
Well, what's going on?
They've taken his father.
What's the matter with you?
He's your chief.
Maybe you should stay here.
He's gone.
It's the price we pay for nonviolence.
I warned you.
Unless you bite the white man in the throat, he'll kill you first.
Now they have my father.
Levec and his men tore off to the reservation.
When was the last time we heard from Tubbs?
Six hours now.
This just came from the V.A.
Joe Dan was wounded, all right, but it wasn't physical.
"Diagnosis:
Acute schizophrenia.
War-induced trauma."
What's that mean?
It means Joe Dan's probably suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders.
Says here that he still gets his monthly supplementary income checks for his disability.
Let me see that.
I thoughtJoe Dan lived on the reservation.
Rico says he does.
He has a place there, deep in the Glades.
Oh, yeah?
Well, then how come they're sending his S.S.I. Checks... to Bayshore Towers in Boca?
No.
I need you here.
Let me know when you get a fix on that address.
[Sighs] Oh, damn, I hate this crap.
Aren't those, uh, crossbows a little high-tech?
You got a problem with that?
No.
No, I just— I thought you were the old values freak.
And maybe the regular, you know, bow and arrow would be more in keeping.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That'd be picturesque as all hell, wouldn't it?
But, uh, this ain't no war dance for tourists, Cooper.
I don't think Levec's gonna be taking photos.
Well, I think it's a little overkill.
Well, when you go up against the white man, you gotta match his firepower.
You know, I've been wondering.
Is it the cocaine that bothers you, or is it the fact that it's the white man's cocaine?
Either way, it's our mission to stop it.
And this time, we're gonna stop it good.
I thought the mission was to get your father back.
[Cell Phone Ringing] Castillo.
Yeah, you know that address whereJoe Dan's checks are being sent?
What about it?
It's the most expensive condo in Boca.
Studios go for a half a mil.
And Joe Dan's got the penthouse.
Want me to meet you there?
No.
Stay at the O.C.B. I'll try to raise Tubbs myself.
[Beeping]
[Chattering]
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Hello.
Who's this?
Becky Wells.
Who's this?
This is Lieutenant Martin Castillo, Miami Vice.
Uh, you work on the reservation?
Yes, how did you know that?
Ricardo Cooper told me about you.
He said you could be trusted.
What's wrong?
He's a police officer.
And he hasn't been able to be contacted.
You know Levec?
Yes.
He and Joe Dan went there.
Is there anything I can do?
You've already done enough.
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna go around back... and see if I can find the chief before the fireworks start.
That okay with you?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Cooper.
What?
Good luck.
What a game.
[Projectile Whistling] [Man Screams]
[Gasps]
Okay, you've eliminated the competition.
Now what?
What competition?
The coke that you dumped in the swamps.
It wasn't coke.
And this wasn't a crusade.
It was a power struggle.
Not bad, Cooper.
Or is it Cooper?
It isn't, but it doesn't matter.
What matters is what's happening right here.
Yeah, what's happening?
You're a lucky man, brother Cooper.
I'm only killing white men today.
[Vehicle Approaching]
[Tires Screeching]
Where's Joe Dan?
He's gone.
The cat, man, is crazy.
[ChiefJumper] What you intend to do when you get wherever you're going?
Go ahead, run.
Leave.
Leave your mess behind.
Destroy your people.
The hell does it matter now?
Who the hell are you?
You're not my son.
[Laughing]
How far you expect to get?
As far as money can buy.
What the hell difference does it make?
Your mind will always be over there.
You're always lecturing, aren't you, oh, great, wise chief?
Me, I'd rather be rich than wise.
So that's what the hell Levec was talking about.
[Chuckles]
Yeah, that's the stuff— cocaine.
You never saw any, did you?
The whole time you're doing business with Levec for chump change.
Oh, excuse me, for the good of the tribe.
I've been a damn fool.
You can say that again, sucker.
Maybe, but I can still go back home, be forgiven.
But you, Joseph— You're lost, son, lost.
I'm lost?
I'm lost?
Who's gonna find you here, old man?
I'm sick of this yapping, this crap.
I've been taking it from you for years!
Yeah, the old ways are the best, huh?
We should have sent you out to pasture a long time ago.
Hello, Joe.
[Hammer Cocks]
Thanks for leaving the door open.
Not unless you want to visit your ancestors.
[Chuckling] Hey, I'm not packing.
I may as well be a hero.
Yeah, there's a lot of them in the joint.
That's not my gig, brother.
I've done my time on that bingo farm in the Everglades.
Now you may know what I am, but I'm still a role model to all the young braves.
- And you're not gonna tell.
- Tell them what?
That the mystic warrior was a freaked-out sideshow, and they were taken in?
Nobody held a gun to their heads.
Damn it, boy.
Ayoung brave was killed out there for you.
Doesn't that bother you?
Yeah, well, I guess I should return the favor.
Hey, come on, man.
Hey, you know what they say, brother man.
Better to die a hero than to live on your knees.
- No!
- [ChiefJumper]Joseph!
No!
Don't!
[Crockett On Phone] How are you gonna give us the location?
There's no way I'll be able to do that.
Lieutenant, I ought to be making the meet.
Acosta's Colombian.
He doesn't trust Anglos.
It has to be me.
[Car Door Opens, Closes] Right on the button, Melendez.
Very impressive.
I'm not here to impress you.
I'm here to take care of my interests.
And my only concern is to make sure that Levec's goods are delivered properly.
And you are not in this meeting to sidestep me with the old man, okay?
I'm in this meeting to take care of my cocaine, not worry about your career moves.
Levec is a first-class guy, man.
You gonna see that tonight.
It's all taken care of.
Good.
Impress me.
It's healthier for you.
Vamos, Pepe.
[Helicopter Whirring]
[Grunts]
Don't talk to me about time again.
[Scoffs] Por favor, da me un break.
Six minutes never killed anybody, you know.
I can kill 20 men in six minutes.
[Speaking Spanish] This merchandise will be worth waiting for.
[Projectile Whistling]
[Machine Gun Fire]
[Gunfire Continues]
My God, how'd you like to be Acosta and have to tell Levec that you lost the whole load?
The old man may not give Acosta a second chance.
- Nothing on the chopper.
- Well, who were those guys, ghosts?
- They were pros.
- Dead commando's prints paid off.
John Lockdam, 35-year-old vet, long-range reconnaissance.
He was a LRRP?
You're lucky you got out at all.
Guy was a Miccosukee Indian.
Call Washington and see if there's any other LRRPs living in South Florida.
- Go down and, uh, see if you can catch 15 minutes with Sergeant Pine over at Metro.
- He's a Seminole.
See if he can help us out on this.
Cool.
Uh-oh, Commander Pursley's coming.
Oh, Lieutenant, you have a moment?
Yeah.
Martin, if it wasn't a problem, I wouldn't have come down here.
The department has always backed your level of involvement, but to have you out there—
I appreciate your concern, Lieutenant.
I really do.
So, who's running O.C.B.
Crockett's in charge and it stays that way... until I put Levec and Acosta out ofbusiness.
Don't get yourself killed.
I'd hate to replace you.
We scored big against the white man today, boys.
John Lockdam died for the glory of our people.
His family would be proud.
We found this amulet on a dead commando.
Does this mean anything?
It's Miccosukee.
You can buy imitations of'em at the Big Cypress Reservation.
You ever hear of any involvements in drug runners down there?
No, have you in the black community?
[Laughing]
Come on, Sergeant.
No, I'm not kidding.
It couldn't happen out there.
Why not?
People adhere to the old values.
They wouldn't allow it.
They pretty much stayed to themselves out there in the swamps until ChiefJumper took over.
He sort of allowed the white man in to buy souvenirs, play bingo and watch alligator wrestling.
He's the man to see.
I really appreciate your time, ChiefJumper.
I was wondering if I could talk to somebody on the reservation about Miccosukee life, maybe gain some insights into modern-day practices.
Sideshows aren't in depth enough?
No, not for my purpose.
Oh, a reporter?
No, actually, I'm doing research on my doctoral thesis.
"Oppression in the Land of the Free."
We get one about every three, four years that want to carry that same torch.
Unfortunately, none ever had the in-depth or the understanding to do it right.
That's interesting.
The best way to learn about a people, Mr. Cooper, is to immerse yourself in our way of life.
Do you have any suggestions?
Becky Wells, she can best explain the difference between your world and ours.
She's lived in both long enough to gain some insight.
She works for us.
Thanks.
[Levec] I am absolutely appalled of the laxity of my security.
Let's just be grateful that you survived so that we can continue doing business.
[Castillo] My survival is gonna cost you, Mr. Levec.
You can understand that, I'm sure.
Sir, about this Indian thing— Yes, Anthony.
It's gotten completely out of control.
I think that they have to be disciplined, like children.
Like children, Anthony?
Do you know that they have totally disrupted any type of a schedule that I've tried to establish?
We're at least two months behind.
How does, uh—
Mr. Melendez, how does that affect our distribution deal?
The delays are costing you approximately 20% of your established lines.
If they continue,
I'm gonna lose a lot of money.
Hmm, I understand.
Sir, I have a major drop happening tomorrow afternoon.
Please, do you think I can pull this thing off with whatever means are necessary?
Violence is a precious commodity, Anthony.
You've yet to learn that.
Yes, sir.
But this time it's justified.
Stop.
Don't.
Mr. Melendez, can we depend upon your services for this next drop?
Yes, if you can guarantee me his security arrangements.
[Chuckles] You have my word, Mr. Melendez.
Anthony, you will have no further interruption.
Can I just— If there is, I'll take it personally.
Well, that's, uh— that's about all.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Mr. Melendez.
Acosta's setting up for another drop.
Are you anywhere?
[Tubbs] Nothing much.
No one seems to be hiding anything.
Acosta said something about the Indians.
It's possible Levec has made arrangements for the Miccosukee.
I don't know.
ChiefJumper, he's a pretty straight arrow.
Out for the good of his people, just got a clinic built, that kind of thing.
Somebody had to tell those commandos about the deal at the Bowl.
What about the chief?
I can't believe he's a player.
Sell the coke and give the money to the tribe.
That's one way to do it.
Stay close to the phone.
Get ready to move and watch your back.
Right, Lieutenant.
[Dial Tone]
[Woman] And that was the way it was with the Miccosukee.
Ten years ago, we were completely dependent on the federal government.
Now, more than half our revenue comes from our own ventures:
The bingo halls, the sale of tax-free cigarettes.
We also built our own baseball field.
All without help from Washington.
Are there any questions?
[Man] Excuse me, may I say something?
You should be very happy with what Washington give you.
Many people would give anything to come over here, you know.
Well, since we were here and all of South Florida was our land, we don't feel Washington gave us anything.
Thank you for visiting Big Cypress.
You've been a wonderful group.
[Muttering]
Ah, excuse me, Becky Wells?
Mr. Cooper?
Yes.
Uh, the chief said to expect an academic, but—
Well, you can't tell a book by looking at the cover.
Uh, would you mind if I talk to you?
Many of our men saw the military as an opportunity.
Many of them became disillusioned, so they came back and went native.
Why was that?
Well, other than this, many of them still live the traditional way.
A lot of the young people emulate them.
It's a very positive thing.
How about you?
Well, I just work on trying to keep the white man aware of our world to understand it.
So what do you think?
Oh, wow.
It's beautiful.
It's my home.
Come with me.
There's more, lots more.
[Woman On P.A.] I'd like to welcome all of you to the Miccosukee Indian Village.
The first stunt that Tommy will be doing is opening the alligator's mouth.
The alligator has 80 teeth, 40 on top and 40 on the bottom.
And he does not have a tongue, but they do have what is called a palate.
So what do you call this?
Survival.
Tommy will next be performing what is called bulldogging.
Yeah, survival.
That means he will be putting the alligator's chin under his own chin.
Who's that guy over there?
That's the chief's son.
He'd be a good interview, ifhe'll talk to you.
[Woman On P.A.] Seven and a half feet long, and weights approximately 275 pounds.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- These animals live to be 75 to 100 years old.
And they are raised domestically— Be careful, Tommy— here in Florida.
The next stunt Tommy is going to do is to put the animal to sleep... by gently rubbing his stomach.
[Applause]
What happens Is the blood rushes to the alligator's brain... and because the brain is small, it puts it to sleep.
Tommy will make the gator mating call, which will wake up the gator.
[Hissing]
As you can now see, the alligator is quite alert and very active.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's our show for today.
I'd like to thank all of you for coming to the Miccosukee Indian Village.
I hope you enjoyed the show.
Thank you again.
[Chuckles] Amazing.
[Levec] And how was your trip into the city?
Not bad.
It was all right.
Ah, lovely, lovely.
Splendid.
Uh, there are some— there are some things I want to talk to you about, Chief.
Some of your people do not have a sense of business acumen.
That's okay.
I understand that.
But some of your people who do, do not know the meaning of our arrangement, and frankly, that, uh— that troubles me.
I don't understand.
Business warranties are sacred to me.
I've— I've been generous to your people.
Gymnasiums, libraries, medical facilities, food, cash.
The rich can well afford to be generous, Mr. Levec.
There's no way back, Chief.
I invested in your authority.
I expect you to maintain control over your braves.
Otherwise, I cannot be held accountable for the peccadillos of my associates.
[Switek] Well, I'm getting tired sitting around here waiting for it to snow.
We may have a cold front moving in.
Here's the D.O.D. List on ex-LRRPs in Dade County.
[Tubbs] Have they all got the same address?
Yeah, the reservation.
All lethal commando trained, courtesy of Uncle.
Two of'em are qualified to fly Hueys.
They look good for the job in the Bowl.
Recognize any of the names?
Yeah, Joe Dan Jumper.
He's the chief's son.
He runs some kind of, uh, back-to-nature boot camp deep in the Glades.
But I don't see him as a snowman.
What do you see him as?
- I don't know.
- Trudy, I want you to call the marine commandant's office.
Get a full service jacket on these guys— psych profiles, the works.
It's gonna take some time.
When's the next load due?
Soon.
Gleason's got a job coming in.
It's gonna be in the water.
Keep an eye on your buddy, Joe Dan.
He may make a move on the load.
Keep in touch with me.
You can get me on the cellular.
You sold us out for the white man's drug money.
Why?
For the good of the tribe.
You know that.
Not the whole tribe.
The vast majority supported me.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be too sure about that either.
If I'd talked to my father the way you speak to me, he'd have skinned me alive.
In the old days, they had respect for the chiefs.
Would your father have misled the tribe to make this devil's bargain?
He'd have made it in his day to save our people.
Yeah, well, your father earned the respect.
That's more than I can say about you.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Oh, that was fantastic.
You're not the first, you know.
What do you mean, I'm not the first?
You're not the first academic who's tried to use us to get research money.
Aw, come on, Becky.
You think I came down here to score a Guggenheim?
- Well, why are you here?
- That's what I'd like to know.
For 400 years, the white man's exploited us for our land.
It's ironic that a black man would come down here, exploit us for a book.
Hey, be cool, brother man.
You're carrying a boulder on your shoulders.
Why don't you just loosen up?
Loosen up?
While Washington cuts our subsidies and Tallahassee cuts our water rights?
You wanna know what's loose?
The screw in my father's head for letting an outsider like you get this close.
You think you're the only people of color... who have to crawl on their knees in this country?
You give me a little Trail ofTears and I'll give you a Little Rock.
For every Indian massacred, I'll give you a lynching.
You had Custer.
We've got the Klan.
What's the difference?
What are you saying?
I'm saying that you don't have a monopoly on suffering.
I'm black, you're red.
To the white man, we're both colored.
Simple as that.
We're both outsiders in the white man's country.
What do you really want?
Like I told Becky,
I want to see what the Miccosukees are about.
I'd like to get to know you.
[Chuckling]
Where I live, you wouldn't last an hour without your Cadillac.
Try me.
Today.
It's happening today.
Acosta, you told me you'd give me 24 hours notice.
Sí, chico.
But that was then, this is now.
Where?
Everglades, by Big Cypress.
Thirty keys de lo mejor, top-shelf.
Hmm.
?
Por qué no?
W-What's the matter?
- It's Miccosukee country.
- Man, you're the tough guy, Melendez.
What are you, scared of the swamps now?
I'm not stupid, Acosta.
They took you out once already.
Now you're on their turf.
You don't got a chance against the Indians.
Oyeme, if Injun Joe tries to pull that same stunt again, we got enough firepower to blow him clean into the happy hunting ground.
[Spanish] I understand, man.
I'm gonna pass.
Melendez, uh, if you stay,
I make it five points per key.
Piensalo.
Cinco puntos, mi socio.
In or out?
- I'm in.
- Perfecto, perfecto.
Okay, uh, we'll pick you up on the docks near the MacArthur... at 4:00.
Don't be late, okay?
Pepe.
[Spanish]
[Ringing]
[Line Ringing]
No, not since this morning.
[Castillo] He has to be warned.
The deal's set in the Glades.
Joe Dan interferes, Acosta's planning to restage the massacre at Wounded Knee.
Lieutenant, let me go out there.
I can get word to Tubbs.
No.
I need you at the base.
That's an order.
So, uh, where were we going?
Yachting.
This is how we deal with the so-called advantages of civilization, Mr. Cooper.
You're gonna make some alligators very jumpy.
[Joe Dan] Better the gators than the schoolkids.
[ManSingingPop]
[Continues]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Continues]
[Vocalizing]
[Fades]
I guess he's trying to create a tribal utopia— the old ways, love for the land.
[Scoffs] Mining the swamps with claymores?
Sounds more like Haiphong Harbor revisited.
What?
Well, he didn't exactly cop to laying the mines.
It was more like, uh, you know, "Watch this."
Plus, he dumped the load.
The guy dumps 30 keys into the swamps?
Man, that gives new meaning to "Just say no."
Why?
That's what we do.
Yeah, but we get paid for it.
Well, like I said, the chief thinks that taking the drug money helps the tribe.
Joe Dan, he thinks that it...
poisons their minds.
Where are the D.O.D. Files?
Trudy's pulling them off the fax right now.
Trudy.
All right, all right.
I'm doing the best I can.
Just got it.
Okay, Silver Star.
Two bronze medals.
This guy's a damn hero.
Wait a minute.
It says here he was war wounded in Grenada.
Went to a V.A. Hospital in Hawaii, and six months later, he was discharged on a Section 8.
Trudy, check with the V.A. Hospital.
See where he's been since then.
Right.
Tubbs, check out his agenda.
The truth:
Before we built the clinic, the elder and sick suffered greatly for lack of medical attention.
Death stared at us daily.
Our pains and agony were constant.
Alcohol and child abuse was rampant.
Our infant mortality rate was 15— 20% higher than the American national average.
Wake up!
What's the point of—
[Joe Dan] Just chill.
It's okay.
We wish the elders no disrespect.
And we applaud the builders of the health clinic.
But this pandering to drug pushers will only result in greater pain and suffering for our people.
And when payment is due on the tribal construction loan?
Then we'll do as we've always done.
Stop living a fool's dream.
You want to live off roots and berries, go ahead.
It's better than living off the white man's vices.
We already peddle duty-free cancer sticks and legalized gambling.
What the hell difference does it make?
If the white man wants to kill himself with drugs, let him.
We only lease him the land.
That's only half the truth.
Tell them!
We've already gone through all of this.
First they rent, and then they own us.
You saw them.
They treated you like a slave.
Is that the kind of world that we want to bring our infants into?
Let's put it in a vote.
The council members have already voted, and that is it.
Is that true?
Then we'll deal with the pushers on our own terms.
And jeopardize the life of every tribal member?
You did that, Chief.
Hey, wait a minute, man.
Where you going?
To protect my people.
You're gonna start a bloodbath.
I'm trying to prevent one.
By taking the law—
The law into my own hands.
That's right.
You're starting to sound like my father, Cooper.
Well, maybe your father... is right about some things, huh?
What about Little Rock and Selma, Cooper?
You folks broke the law of the land for a higher good, right?
Civil disobedience doesn't include blowing people up.
Yeah, well, the times, they are a-changin'.
Your organization has been the envy of so many for so long, but yet—
Now, now, internal management is a... rather difficult fence to walk at times.
We have a lot of money and a lot of time invested in this interest.
But yet you insist on handing it to Acosta.
Oh, a terrible, terrible, bad judgment on my part.
L-I just don't know why I decided to give him a second chance.
You know, where I come from, the term "second chance" doesn't exist.
[Chuckling] There's your reputation for efficiency.
Very good.
That's why we're doing business together.
I don't see business.
I see Indians.
I don't see business.
I guarantee you next time will be different.
I won't deal with Acosta.
Don't let Acosta concern you.
Excuse me.
Senor Acosta.
Levec's cutting his expenses.
He's also cleaning house.
The chief may be next.
[Tubbs] And Joe Dan's about to go on the warpath.
What's our move?
Switek's on his way back from the D.A. Office.
I wanna see if we have enough to move on Levec.
I'll send Becky Wilson back to the chief's house and have them meet atJoe Dan's camp.
Maybe I can get them to talk and reduce the body count.
Can you trust her?
Don't have much choice, but yeah, I do.
Keep me informed.
Yeah, uh, Lieutenant.
It's not enough.
The D.A. Has no proof Levec actually stuffed Acosta in the tank.
So everybody's a free agent.
They get to have their little war.
Let's go home.
Chief!
ChiefJumper.
Where's Joe Dan?
Becky, what happened?
Where is he?
I don't know.
He's in some private place.
Apparently, it's some big secret.
Well, that's just great.
Well, what's going on?
They've taken his father.
What's the matter with you?
He's your chief.
Maybe you should stay here.
He's gone.
It's the price we pay for nonviolence.
I warned you.
Unless you bite the white man in the throat, he'll kill you first.
Now they have my father.
Levec and his men tore off to the reservation.
When was the last time we heard from Tubbs?
Six hours now.
This just came from the V.A.
Joe Dan was wounded, all right, but it wasn't physical.
"Diagnosis:
Acute schizophrenia.
War-induced trauma."
What's that mean?
It means Joe Dan's probably suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders.
Says here that he still gets his monthly supplementary income checks for his disability.
Let me see that.
I thoughtJoe Dan lived on the reservation.
Rico says he does.
He has a place there, deep in the Glades.
Oh, yeah?
Well, then how come they're sending his S.S.I. Checks... to Bayshore Towers in Boca?
No.
I need you here.
Let me know when you get a fix on that address.
[Sighs] Oh, damn, I hate this crap.
Aren't those, uh, crossbows a little high-tech?
You got a problem with that?
No.
No, I just— I thought you were the old values freak.
And maybe the regular, you know, bow and arrow would be more in keeping.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That'd be picturesque as all hell, wouldn't it?
But, uh, this ain't no war dance for tourists, Cooper.
I don't think Levec's gonna be taking photos.
Well, I think it's a little overkill.
Well, when you go up against the white man, you gotta match his firepower.
You know, I've been wondering.
Is it the cocaine that bothers you, or is it the fact that it's the white man's cocaine?
Either way, it's our mission to stop it.
And this time, we're gonna stop it good.
I thought the mission was to get your father back.
[Cell Phone Ringing] Castillo.
Yeah, you know that address whereJoe Dan's checks are being sent?
What about it?
It's the most expensive condo in Boca.
Studios go for a half a mil.
And Joe Dan's got the penthouse.
Want me to meet you there?
No.
Stay at the O.C.B. I'll try to raise Tubbs myself.
[Beeping]
[Chattering]
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Hello.
Who's this?
Becky Wells.
Who's this?
This is Lieutenant Martin Castillo, Miami Vice.
Uh, you work on the reservation?
Yes, how did you know that?
Ricardo Cooper told me about you.
He said you could be trusted.
What's wrong?
He's a police officer.
And he hasn't been able to be contacted.
You know Levec?
Yes.
He and Joe Dan went there.
Is there anything I can do?
You've already done enough.
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna go around back... and see if I can find the chief before the fireworks start.
That okay with you?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Cooper.
What?
Good luck.
What a game.
[Projectile Whistling] [Man Screams]
[Gasps]
Okay, you've eliminated the competition.
Now what?
What competition?
The coke that you dumped in the swamps.
It wasn't coke.
And this wasn't a crusade.
It was a power struggle.
Not bad, Cooper.
Or is it Cooper?
It isn't, but it doesn't matter.
What matters is what's happening right here.
Yeah, what's happening?
You're a lucky man, brother Cooper.
I'm only killing white men today.
[Vehicle Approaching]
[Tires Screeching]
Where's Joe Dan?
He's gone.
The cat, man, is crazy.
[ChiefJumper] What you intend to do when you get wherever you're going?
Go ahead, run.
Leave.
Leave your mess behind.
Destroy your people.
The hell does it matter now?
Who the hell are you?
You're not my son.
[Laughing]
How far you expect to get?
As far as money can buy.
What the hell difference does it make?
Your mind will always be over there.
You're always lecturing, aren't you, oh, great, wise chief?
Me, I'd rather be rich than wise.
So that's what the hell Levec was talking about.
[Chuckles]
Yeah, that's the stuff— cocaine.
You never saw any, did you?
The whole time you're doing business with Levec for chump change.
Oh, excuse me, for the good of the tribe.
I've been a damn fool.
You can say that again, sucker.
Maybe, but I can still go back home, be forgiven.
But you, Joseph— You're lost, son, lost.
I'm lost?
I'm lost?
Who's gonna find you here, old man?
I'm sick of this yapping, this crap.
I've been taking it from you for years!
Yeah, the old ways are the best, huh?
We should have sent you out to pasture a long time ago.
Hello, Joe.
[Hammer Cocks]
Thanks for leaving the door open.
Not unless you want to visit your ancestors.
[Chuckling] Hey, I'm not packing.
I may as well be a hero.
Yeah, there's a lot of them in the joint.
That's not my gig, brother.
I've done my time on that bingo farm in the Everglades.
Now you may know what I am, but I'm still a role model to all the young braves.
- And you're not gonna tell.
- Tell them what?
That the mystic warrior was a freaked-out sideshow, and they were taken in?
Nobody held a gun to their heads.
Damn it, boy.
Ayoung brave was killed out there for you.
Doesn't that bother you?
Yeah, well, I guess I should return the favor.
Hey, come on, man.
Hey, you know what they say, brother man.
Better to die a hero than to live on your knees.
- No!
- [ChiefJumper]Joseph!
No!
Don't!
Transcripts from novels and synchro: wyxchari
Psst!
Do you want to talk about it?
I don't talk to strangers.
Perhaps I can help.
I didn't ask for any.
You know you shouldn't sit here.
It's dangerous.
I don't care anymore.
Let them get me.
You don't have to face your suffering alone, you know.
What do you mean?
There's a place.
A secret place.
Where some of us gather to indulge their depressions, to share their miseries, with other killjoys like you and me.
I'm not a killjoy!
That's what they would call you.
You interested?
Perhaps.
Oooh, it changed my life.
Here, my card.
Here, take it!
"Silas P"
Other side!
But it says...
"Happiness Patrol, Undercover"!
Time to get really depressed!
Have a nice death!
How about a triceratops?
A three-horned dinosaur with a mouth like a beak?
The Brigadier saw one in the London Underground once.
And a tyrranosaurus rex?
Met quite a few actually.
Any pterodactyls?
Lots of pterodactyls!
We should make a visit sometime.
To Earth in the Upper Cretaceous?
Wicked!
A very good time for dinosaurs!
I love dinosaurs!
But I hate that.
Liff music!
Where are we, Professor anyway?
A planet, an Earth colony settled some time in your future.
Do you like it?
No.
No, neither do I. Why not?
Too phony.
Too happy!
Yes, I've been hearing disturbing rumours about Terra Alpha.
So I thought I'd better look in some time.
So tonight's the night?
Tonight's the night.
I've been hearing rumours of something evil, and we're going to get to the bottom of it!
Your third badge, Silas P!
45 killjoys to your credit!
I'm very happy!
I'm glad that you're happy ma'am, but it is actually 47!
I do the counting, thank you, Silas P.
Sorry ma'am.
Still, I like your initiative, your enterprise.
I'll see that you go far.
I might mean for the top.
Not quite the very top, Silas P?
Professor, this music is winding me up!
Yes, it makes you wonder how the natives stand it.
I don't see any natives.
Here comes one now!
Name?
Ace!
No nicknames, aliases, pseudonyms, nom-de-plumes.
Real name!
It is my real name!
Tell him Professor!
What's in a name?
I could report you for that!
Can you smell something, Professor?
Now that you come to mention it.
You will have to forgive my young friend,
Ace, Mr, um, er you didn't tell me your name.
You're right, I didn't give it to you, but I don't have to.
I'm on official business from Galactic Centre.
How do I know you're telling the truth.
Here, my identification.
Thank you, "Trevor Sigma".
Actually, my nickname at collge was "Theta Sigma".
No nicknames!
Right.
Over there.
This way!
Well?
Bullet holes.
Yes, there is evil on Terra Alpha, and we've got to put a stop to it.
How long?
Tonight!
Won't that be dangerous?
Of course.
Right, where do we start?
First, we get ourselves arrested.
Professor, what have they done!
Yes, looks good actually.
You look unhappy about something.
No, not really, just admiring your handywork.
Miserable looking thing!
Our thoughts exactly.
And you?
Are you happy?
I would say she is, given the deeply distressing nature of some fundamental universal truths.
What do you mean?
She's happy and I'm happy.
Can't you afford a real gun?
Gordon Bennet!
I'm glad you're happy, but what are you doing here?
You don't look like locals!
In fact you look like killjoys!
What's a killjoy?
Alright, you must be from off-world.
In future stay within the specified tourist zones!
What?
You're free to go!
You're not going to arrest us?
I don't see why!
Doctor, they're not going to arrest us!
Badges.
What?
Yes, I believe all visitors are issued badges at customs.
Yes.
Where're your badges?
I've got badges
She's got badges.
This one's for top of Everest.
Not interested.
Where're your badges?
Oh dear.
I've seemed to lost them.
He is obviously a spy and she is his accomplice.
He will disappear and she will audition for the Happiness Patrol!
What do you mean?
You're under arrest!
Phew!
About time!
What are you watching, dear?
It's a videotape, dear, something called "Routine Disappearance No. 499,987.
Turn that off, dear, that's for my eyes only.
Oh well...
And besides, you're missing my broadcast.
And finally, Joseph C and I wish to thank you for your stirling work in catching the killjoys.
Sit down my dear, you may find this instructive.
Remember, keep smiling.
Happiness will prevail!
I thought we were arrested.
I thought we were going to prison.
Hold the two bananas and nudge.
Never fails.
Oh well, can't win them all.
That's all right, I don't like to win anymore.
Why not?
First of all, I'm a killjoy.
And secondly, I don't like the prize!
What is the prize?
You're about to find out.
Congratulations and well played!
Here is your prize joke!
Did you hear about the killjoy who won an outing with the Happiness Patrol?
He was tickled to death!
Enjoy yourself.
I see what you mean.
The delivery's terrible.
The joke's not much good either.
You're right.
It's tastless, smug, and worst of all it's badly constructed, I mean, who writes that stuff?
I wrote it!
YOU wrote it?
That's right.
I used to be her gag writer, when I was Harold F. Then my brother disappeared.
I heard of other disappearences.
They caught me in the rocket port zone, trying to contact Terra Omega, and they put me in here and regeraded me to Harold V.
But why are we being kept here?
Why don't we just leave?
Excuse me?
Yeesss?
Is this a prison?
A prison?
Of course not!
This is the Waiting Zone.
We don't have any prisons on Terra Alpha, miserable places!
So what you're saying that this isn't a place of incarceration, and we're free to go if we wish?
Well, yes and no.
This isn't a prison...
but cross that line, and you're a dead man.
Congratulations.
Bad luck, old man.
Still, we have to be fair.
Wouldn't treat you otherwise.
So what you're telling me is that Helen A punches people for wearing dark clothes?
That's right.
It also goes for listening to slow music, and reading poems.
Unless they're limericks, of course.
This is terrible!
Walking in the rain too, if you're on your own and don't carry an umbrella.
Why don't people stand up to her?
The people are scared!
Remember the Happiness Patrol, Ace!
Bunch of ratbags!
Ratbags with guns!
The Happiness Patrol are the nice side of her regime!
Do you know who the Kandyman is, Doctor?
Sounds rather sweet.
He's dangerous!
He's doing experiments, and that's why we're here.
He needs guinea pigs: guinea pigs like you and me!
What sort of experiments?
Can't find out.
What else does he do, this Kandyman?
He makes sweets.
You wanted to see me ma'am?
Just curiousity.
I wanted to know what the Kandyman had cooked up for us tonight?
It's a 'fondant surprise'.
Flavour?
Strawberry.
Delicious!
My favourite.
So you reckon the Kandyman's the one behind all the disappearances?
One of the ones.
There are 3 ways to disappear on Terra Alpha.
The Late Show at the Forum, a visit to the Kandy Kitchen, and something else.
What sort of something else?
I don't know.
Rumour has it that Helen A prefers the firing squad.
It says here, that you have been "found guilty of an ostentatious display of public grief"?
Oh dear!
PATROL!
And so you have been sentenced to the severest penalty decreed by Helen A!
PATROL, DISMISS!
The fondant supreme!
Time we were going, Professor?
We've got a night's work ahead of us, and I think we've learned enough.
Ace!
A prison break!
A waiting zone break.
And I think we'll take our new friend with us.
What's that?
We're going to escape.
There is no escape.
Well, I must be going.
So soon.
We haven't finished yet.
There's still his brother Harold V to deal with.
Ah yes, his brother.
Families are very important to people's happiness.
I think he got a buzz out of that.
Shut up!
Easy, Ace!
Rather a shocking experience.
Let me get at her!
Save the anger.
You're no good to me like this.
I want to nail those scumbags.
I want to make them very, very unhappy.
Don't worry.
We will.
What time you cook this?
- Tell me.
- Yes.
I was wondering about your go-kart.
- It's not my go-kart.
It's the waiting zone gokart.
- Yes.
I was *****.
If I were to get into it and drive off, what would you do?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing.
- You wouldn't raise the alarm, shoot us.
- Nothing.
You're right.
It is booby-trapped.
You dear me you my darling?
Well, you *****.
I ***** now.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- You're not thinking of starting that?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Give it to me.
Get off.
It's a bomb, isn't it?
I'm trying to defuse it.
Let me have a go.
I'm trying not to blow us both to pieces.
I never get to have any fun.
Start the go-kart.
You can drive.
What do you want, Professor?
I haven't caught you at a bad time.
*****.
Hey!
I arrest you for the evasion of Happiness Patrol auditions.
Where are they?
What do you mean?
The question is, are they ready for me?
Take her back to the Happiness Patrol headquarters and we'll continue the search for the spy.
That should do it.
Ace?
Nice of the Happiness Patrol to leave us in peace.
Ace?
I think enjoy this.
OK, stop there Ace now.
Good.
Do you know any jokes?
I always forget jokes.
How about songs?
I know this great song about this guy and his girlfriend.
She drops the ring he gave her on a railway track, and when she goes back to get it she's killed by a train, so he's really miserable for the rest of his life.
It's fantastic.
Happy songs, Ace.
Songs about sunshine and furry animals.
I woke up one morning...
I know that song.
There are a million blues songs that start like that.
But I did wake up one morning.
Suddenly something was very clear.
I couldn't go on, smiling.
Smiling while my friends disappeared.
Wearing this uniform.
Smiling and trying to pretend I'm someone I'm not.
Trying to pretend I'm happy.
Better to let it end.
Better just to relax and let it happen.
I woke up one morning and realized, it was all over.
Look, I'm sorry.
I think we'll abandon our rehearsal.
I'm not Happiness Patrol material anyway.
They stand for everything I hate.
Like you said, smiling all the time, smiling when it doesn't mean anything.
I'm not one of them.
I can't twirl a baton;
I can't dance;
I can't sing.
No, but there is one thing you might be very good at.
Oh yeah?
A disappearing act.
What do I have to do?
It's simple, I ***** the sky and I close my eyes.
When I open them you're gone.
Excuse me.
You wouldn't have a small automotive jack, would you?
I'm afraid not.
But I can offer you the hand of friendship.
Sit down.
Tell me about yourself.
I'm looking for Helen A. Perhaps you could point me in the right direction.
I can tell you where to find her.
- But when you meet you make sure you're smiling.
- Smiling?
She hates miserable people.
Haven't you heard about the massacre?
I've heard rumours.
She sent out her spies to find the most depressing township on the planet.
The Happiness Patrol went in and razed the place to the ground.
But why?
Policy, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to distress you.
I'm not distressed, I'm angry.
Why do the people let her walk all over them?
There are lots of reasons.
The Happiness Patrol, the Kandy Man.
The Kandy Man!
He's next on my list of people to see.
Then I'd cross him off fast if I were you.
He's Helen A's henchman, does all her dirty work.
There are small pockets of resistance, though.
Quiet murmurings of rebellion.
- Are you interested?
- But of course.
There's a place, a secret place, where we're planning for the day when Helen A and the Kandy Man will be called to account.
Here, my card.
- Thanks.
Silas P.
- Other side.
Happiness Patrol undercover.
Excellent!
Perhaps you could take a message...
- Are you a musician?
- Sort of.
- Shall we go?
- You better go.
You not can help me Silas. *****
No!
Wait!
- I'm the Doctor.
- Earl Sigma.
A sort of musician?
No.
Realy a medical student.
Fifth year post med psychology.
What does the Sigma stands for?
Stands for alien.
All visitors are called Sigma.
So you're travelling through the colonies?
Yeah, I'm on vacation, paying my way with music.
But I kind of got stuck here.
It's a interesting planet from a psychological standpoint.
- Yes.
You better go.
- No.
This way.
There's someone I'd like to meet.
What is this place?
I believe it's where they make sweets.
*****
They think it's easy.
A thousand pounds of praline cracknel indeed!
They don't know about his moods.
He's terrible when he's roused.
I tell them but they don't believe me.
They're lucky they get any sweets at all.
Enough!
Where are my specimens?
If they think it's so easy they should have a go at making sweets themselves.
Most of them wouldn't know popcorn from peppermints.
I said where are my specimens.
It's time for an experiment.
I think they just nipped under the table.
There's no one here.
- But I saw them.
- Show me.
Well I'll...
I could have sworn they were under here.
I can feel one of my moods coming on.
Welcome to the Kandy Kitchen, gentlemen.
I'm sure the pleasure will be ours.
I do hope so, I like my volunteers to die with smiles on their faces.
What are you doing ?
Soaking up rays, babe.
Except your sun lamp isn't working.
I've been here for 5 hours -- Nothing.
5 hours ?
You're lucky you didn't get sunburned.
Aaaghh !
Sorry.
Oh, it hurts, it hurts.
Would you like some cold cream ?
Just one scoop.
I'm on a diet.
It's for your nose.
That's where i'm trying to lose the weight.
I'm talking about cold cream;
Not ice cream;
cold cream.
Understand ?
You're talking like they're two different things.
They are !
Aren't you listening ?
What is this ?
Healing through hollering ?
Brian, what happened ?
Yeah, you look terrible.
I was in a fight.
Looking like that ?
Yeesh !
**
Ow !
Nobody does this and gets away with it.
Unless they're over 3 feet tall.
Brian, what happened ?
I was in a fight with bobby duncan.
Who is bobby duncan ?
Isn't he that smart-Mouth little punk down the street ?
Yeah.
We have to retaliate.
You beat up his mother,
You beat up his sister,
And i'll eat up his cat.
We're not rumbling with the duncans.
What started the fight ?
Was it over some woman ?
Kind of...
yeah.
All right, brian !
It doesn't matter.
I don't want you fighting.
But bobby said you were old, ugly, and dumb.
Well, even so,
Next time just ignore him,
The little brat.
Mom, all kids think adults are old.
And ugly and dumb ?
He's entitled to his opinion.
So, anyway, i hit him.
Except, he hit me back harder.
Over and over.
I know you think you were standing up for me,
But you shouldn't fight.
Has he ever actually seen me ?
Yeah.
I think i should call his mother.
No !
But he might beat you up again.
I'd rather get beat up, than be called a snitch.
Yeah, that's the worst.
On melmac, some guy called me a snitch...
Just because i turned him in to the secret police.
When bobby saw me, was i in curlers ?
Let it go.
After this lesson,
You'll never get beat up at school again.
I'm not going to school anymore.
Don't say that.
School's important.
Dropouts don't get anywhere in life.
You'll hang around the house all day eating and watching tv.
But i want to be like you.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
The trick is to concentrate all your energy,
And let it explode in a flash of destruction.
Watch.
Eee-Yah.
All right !
That never worked before.
Do it again.
Okay.
Eee-Yah.
I guess there's pain only when you don't break the board.
Unbelievable pain.
Hey, brian.
Your mother told me what happened.
Are you okay ?
Yeah, alf's teaching me the martial arts.
I don't want you teaching my son to fight, alf.
Call an ambulance.
I'm serious !
And i'm not ?
I broke my hand.
Let me see.
It looks fine.
Thank you, professor x-Ray.
It's fine, alf.
It's fine.
That feels good.Can you do my shoulders ?
If you really want to help,
Teach him not to fight.
He already knows that -- Look at his face.
Excuse me, alf.
I know whereof i speak.
When i was brian's age,
A bully lived on our block.
He was always picking on me.
Whereof ?
Sorry.
I'm still fascinated...
By the oddities of the english language.
Anyway,
This bully was named clarence.
Ha !
Tough neighborhood.
Ow !
Every day i'd try to stand up to him.
And every day he'd beat me up.
Until finally my father told me ...
To just turn the other cheek.
Is this the same grandfather that talked to corn chips ?
He was a wise man.
You know what happened ?
When i refused to fight, clarence stopped bothering me.
It's no fun to pick on someone who won't fight back.
So tomorrow, if bobby starts teasing you,
I want you to just walk away.Okay ?
Okay.
Willie, my hand still hurts.
Kiss it ?
Whoa !
How continental.
I love you, too, mom.
'Bye.
Why are those boards in the fireplace ?
Alf said, "if you can't break them, burn them."
Alf !
Boing !
Alf, you may not burn perfectly good lumber.
Oh, right.
One of these days ...
Willie's going to build that gazebo.
Brian, what's wrong.
Nothing.See you tomorrow.
Oh, not again.
Hi, dad.
Bobby beat me up again.
Oh, no.
I tried to walk away,
But he was sitting on me at the time.
Lynn, get the first-Aid kit.
Come on, let me clean you up.
All right !
That's it !
I say we fight violence with violence.
That's how we solved things back home.
Don't you remember what happened to your planet ?
It blew up in a nuclear holocaust.Why ?
Don't you see the connection ?
What connection ?
I give up.
Me, too.
My head is spinning.
Maybe a cold cream sundae --
You should have heard what bobby said.
Did he insult me again ?
No.Dad.
What did he say about me ?
He said you must have been desperate to marry someone like mom.
I'm glad to see he's off my case.
Did he say anything about me ?
He said you were cute.
Does he know i'm mom's daughter ?
This isn't funny !
I'm sorry, but i have to call bobby's mother.
Save your dialing finger.
She's not home.
She went to the liquor store.
Who told you that ?
Bobby's father.
By the way, he's coming here to beat up willie.
What ?
Why ?
He didn't like the way you talked to him on the phone.
I thought we agreed that you would stop...
Impersonating me on the phone.
We agreed i'd stop impersonating the cast of "green acres."
[As mr.
Haney from green acres] mr.
Haney could have sold brian...
Some revivifying potion...
From the back of his truck.
What did "i" say to bobby's father ?
You were a bit rough.
It was so unlike you.
What did he say to me ?
He said that he was going to turn your face...
Into silly putty.
Look at the bright side.
You'll be able to reproduce the sunday comics.
[ Doorbell ]
That might be bobby's dad.
Don't worry, willie.
We won't let them keep you alive artificially.
You must be mr.
Duncan.
You're gonna rip my face off, huh ?
You know, i never meant to say that.
I was upset about brian.
Please accept my apology.
You beat up bruce lee ?
Not the bruce lee.
Not the karate bruce lee.
In fact his name was actually herman.
Won't you come in ?
Oh, i get the picture.
You talk tough on the phone, but can't back it up.
Basically, yes.
This must be mrs.
Weasel.
So pleased to meet you.
Why did i come over ?
I could have just sent bobby.
Say, i said i was sorry.
If you're not big enough --
Is that a crack about my height ?
I have beat up bigger guys than you, four eyes.
Ha.
Ha.
Four eyes.
Very original.
What's happening ?
Mr. Duncan called dad "four eyes."
Ha ha.
Oh that duncan.
What a yo-Yo.
Shh !
We just want your son to stop picking on brian.
Bobby told me your son threw the first punch.
Because your son called me old, ugly, and dumb.
Ugly ?
Better get that kid some glasses, huh ?
No, better make that contacts.
Right, four eyes ?
That joke gets less funny every time i hear it,
Shorty.
Mom, dad, is it time for church yet ?
Are you trying to get your daddy out of a fight ?
Guess whose idea that was ?
I don't need my daughter to keep me from fighting.
No, you can run from fights on your own.
That's it.
I'd like you to leave now.
Oh, i'm scared, i'm scared.
I've heard more than enough from you.
Is that so, sissy boy ?
Yes, it is.
You obnoxious little man !
[ Crash ]
Way to go, four eyes !
Doughnut, willie ?
No sweets for "boom boom" tanner.
He's in training.
I'm not in training.
I got you a fight with mr.
Hurlbut down the street.
Mr. Hurlbut is my friend !
Not after the way "you" talked to him.
Stop calling people !
Don't hit, don't hit !
What i did was wrong.
I feel very bad about it.
Honey, don't torture yourself.
Yeah, the bum deserved it.
He was a short, beady-Eyed loudmouth.
Unlike anyone we know.
I'm not beady-Eyed.
[ Doorbell ]
Who could that be ?
Hard to say.
I called so many people.
Everyone wants to take a poke at the champ.
I'm glad mike tyson lives in new york.
Actually, he's thinking of moving out here.
Hey, that's what his girlfriend told me.
Hi, tanner.
Whatever i said on the phone, i'm sorry.
I just came over to congratulate you, killer.
It's "boom boom."
Everyone is talking about what willie did to that awful mr.
Duncan.
How did they find out ?
From me, of course.
There's 3 ways news can travel --
Telephone, telegraph, and tell raquel.
So give us a blow-By-Blow.
I never meant to hurt him.
I was trying to teach brian not to fight.
You really pounded that lesson home.
I'm afraid so.
Don't feel bad.
Mr. Duncan deserved it.
He had the nerve to complain...
About trevor burning tires in our yard.
Like i can control the wind.
If willie can beat trevor and mr.
Litwak,
We can get a bigger purse when he fights mrs.
Byrd.
We'll only take the purse if they throw in matching shoes.
Iseverythingsettled?
Duncan's on his way over to talk to me in person.
Where's brian ?
Is he going to sing the national anthem ?
I want him to be here...
To see that i can solve these things without fighting.
He's in his bedroom.
[ Doorbell ]
Good luck, dad.
Remember it's your title.
He has to take it away from you.
Brian ?
All right, tanner.
I'm back.
Please come in.
What is it ?
I wanted you to meet mr.
Duncan.
This is my son, brian.
This is the kid that gave my kid the black eye ?
You really gave bobby a black eye ?
Kate.
I mean i hope he's okay.
Can i get you anything ?
How about a beer ?
Of course.
It is almost noon.
Nice walk.
That's my wife.
What's going on ?
Mr. Duncan likes the way i walk.
Me, too !
Especially when you're carrying dinner.
That man gives me the creeps.
How can you say that ?
Willie's your father.
I was talking about mr.
Duncan.
Oh, right.
I'm just trying to get our kids to stop fighting.
Why ?
Fighting is good exercise for kids.
Not for the guy on the ground.
Thanks, babe.
You're welcome, bub.
Anyway, where i grew up, we were always fighting --
At home, school, the pet store.
The pet store ?
Hey, i like fighting.
It made me what i am today.
The scrap metal business is a tough racket.
Scrap metal ?
You can keep the can.
Is that a put-Down ?
I'm a scrap metal dealer, not a garbage man.
I think you're being overly sensitive here.
Oh, yeah ?
Well you're the goofiest looking doofus i've ever met.
That doesn't bother me.
Dad ?
Those are just words, brian.
[ Mocking ] those are just words, brian.
All right.
I've had my say.
I'd like you to leave.
Now that you know what i do for a living,
I'm not good enough to be in your house.
Would you just leave ?
Why don't you make me ?
I would, but i'm too civilized.
More like sissified, hey, doofus ?
You are out of here !
[ Crash ]
Yay, mom !
Let's hear it for kate "boom boom" tanner.
You realize what you did was wrong.
Yeah, i know.
It's true, brian.
In spite of what you've seen and heard,
Fighting is wrong.
Don't argue with them, or you'll wind up in the trash.
Kate, when are you free to mud wrestle raquel ?
In this corner,
Weighing in at 14 ounces,
"Mummy-Hamed" ali.
And in this corner weighing in at,
None of your business,
Gordon "sugar ray" shumway.
[ Imitates a crowd's roar ]
Round 1 --
Ding.
Ow, low blow, low blow !
He hit you in the nose.
Anything below my hairline is a low blow.
Hi.
Guess what ?
Bobby's not picking on brian anymore.
He's scared of him.
That's what happens when your parents are...
"He-Man" and "she-Ra," masters of the neighborhood.
Weren't you in the middle of a bout ?
I'm going to wrap this one up, mummy.
Ha, ha, ha.
Take that !
Bet you didn't know i could do that.
The mummy's not the only one with a round bottom.
Body block !

What are you doing ?
Soaking up rays, babe.
Except your sun lamp isn't working.
I've been here for 5 hours -- Nothing.
5 hours ?
You're lucky you didn't get sunburned.
Aaaghh !
Sorry.
Oh, it hurts, it hurts.
Would you like some cold cream ?
Just one scoop.
I'm on a diet.
It's for your nose.
That's where i'm trying to lose the weight.
I'm talking about cold cream;
Not ice cream;
cold cream.
Understand ?
You're talking like they're two different things.
They are !
Aren't you listening ?
What is this ?
Healing through hollering ?
Brian, what happened ?
Yeah, you look terrible.
I was in a fight.
Looking like that ?
Yeesh !
**
Ow !
Nobody does this and gets away with it.
Unless they're over 3 feet tall.
Brian, what happened ?
I was in a fight with bobby duncan.
Who is bobby duncan ?
Isn't he that smart-Mouth little punk down the street ?
Yeah.
We have to retaliate.
You beat up his mother,
You beat up his sister,
And i'll eat up his cat.
We're not rumbling with the duncans.
What started the fight ?
Was it over some woman ?
Kind of...
yeah.
All right, brian !
It doesn't matter.
I don't want you fighting.
But bobby said you were old, ugly, and dumb.
Well, even so,
Next time just ignore him,
The little brat.
Mom, all kids think adults are old.
And ugly and dumb ?
He's entitled to his opinion.
So, anyway, i hit him.
Except, he hit me back harder.
Over and over.
I know you think you were standing up for me,
But you shouldn't fight.
Has he ever actually seen me ?
Yeah.
I think i should call his mother.
No !
But he might beat you up again.
I'd rather get beat up, than be called a snitch.
Yeah, that's the worst.
On melmac, some guy called me a snitch...
Just because i turned him in to the secret police.
When bobby saw me, was i in curlers ?
Let it go.
After this lesson,
You'll never get beat up at school again.
I'm not going to school anymore.
Don't say that.
School's important.
Dropouts don't get anywhere in life.
You'll hang around the house all day eating and watching tv.
But i want to be like you.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
The trick is to concentrate all your energy,
And let it explode in a flash of destruction.
Watch.
Eee-Yah.
All right !
That never worked before.
Do it again.
Okay.
Eee-Yah.
I guess there's pain only when you don't break the board.
Unbelievable pain.
Hey, brian.
Your mother told me what happened.
Are you okay ?
Yeah, alf's teaching me the martial arts.
I don't want you teaching my son to fight, alf.
Call an ambulance.
I'm serious !
And i'm not ?
I broke my hand.
Let me see.
It looks fine.
Thank you, professor x-Ray.
It's fine, alf.
It's fine.
That feels good.Can you do my shoulders ?
If you really want to help,
Teach him not to fight.
He already knows that -- Look at his face.
Excuse me, alf.
I know whereof i speak.
When i was brian's age,
A bully lived on our block.
He was always picking on me.
Whereof ?
Sorry.
I'm still fascinated...
By the oddities of the english language.
Anyway,
This bully was named clarence.
Ha !
Tough neighborhood.
Ow !
Every day i'd try to stand up to him.

- Happy Mother's Day, Ma.
- Oh, you look beautiful.
Yeah, yeah.
Talk is cheap, and so is that buffet, so let's get movin' before all the shrimp is gone.
We can't.
Charlie Jr.
Hasn't called to wish me happy Mother's Day.
Michael hasn't called me yet.
Janet hasn't called me yet, although she usually doesn't.
All my children called me...
except Phil.
I know he's thinking of me.
He's just short of cash.
[Phone rings]
Hello.
Person-to-person from the Duke of Windsor to Queen Elizabeth?
Oh, that's for me.
That's my Phil.
Hello.
The queen's not here.
She went shopping.
Thanks for calling, Phil, and send my love to the... damn.
Every year they catch on quicker and quicker.
I love when Phil calls on Mother's Day.
It's the one time he doesn't ask for money.
One Mother's Day, I had to ask for money.
Stan's business wasn't doing well, and we had to ask his mother for a loan.
- [Knocking] - [Woman] Go away!
Mama, it's me, Stanley.
- Oh, Stanley.
- Ma.
My pride and joy.
Sunshine of my life.
Hello, Mother Zbornak.
Yeah, right.
Here, Mama.
This is for you.
Happy Mother's Day.
Oh, thank you, Stanley.
Ah.
The Artwork of Adolf Hitler.
The minute we saw it, we knew it was for you.
Thank you so much, Stanley.
I'm going to put it on the coffee table.
It's from Dorothy, too.
If I had to thank her, I'd choke on the words.
Please risk it.
So, tell me, Stanley.
How are things at the novelty store?
Couldn't be better.
I was Salesman of the Month.
I'm sure you'll be proud to know that the name Zbornak has become synonymous with plastic vomit.
I...
I would absolutely love a cup of tea.
Oh, sure, Stanley.
Anything you want, sweetheart.
Start being nice, otherwise she's not gonna give us that money.
You ask.
She wouldn't refuse you.
Would break Mama's heart if she knew I was a failure.
To her, I have the business sense of a Rockefeller
- and the charm of Cary Grant.
- I'm not surprised.
The woman drinks grain alcohol out of a measuring cup.
Here's the tea.
This is just hot water.
Enjoy.
I just remembered.
I have an important call to make.
You know the novelty business.
The pay phone's at the end of the trailer court.
What're you here for?
What do you want, money?
No.
Absolutely not.
How did you know?
I got the feeling my yutz son crapped out at his job.
Yutz.
I've never heard you say anything bad about Stan.
I don't have to.
The whole world makes fun of him.
Always has.
That's why I make him out to be more than he is.
- Then you will give him the money.
- No.
But I'll give it to you under one condition.
Don't ever tell Stanley it came from me.
- I don't understand.
- Stanley has a tendency to be weak.
If he knew I was a soft touch, he'd never amount to anything.
- How much do you need?
- $500.
I'll give you a thousand.
You know, Dorothy, I'm glad Stanley married you.
You love him, but you're tough on him.
Then why are you so mean?
If Stanley knew I liked you, he'd hang around here all the time.
He's a yutz.
Who needs him around here?
- Dorothy.
- Oh, thank God you came.
I thought she was gonna strangle me.
- I take it you weren't able...
- We'll figure something out.
I'll call you, Mama.
- Happy Mother's Day.
- Good-bye.
- Happy Mother's Day.
- Yeah, right.
As it turned out, Stan's mother wasn't so bad after all.
Please.
The woman wasn't human.
I think she ate mice.
[Phone rings]
Hello?
Charlie!
Hey, everyone, it's Charlie Jr.
Oh!
Guess what.
He says it's cold in Minnesota.
Get outta here.
Is it cold enough that if you put your tongue on something metal, it'll stick?
Sure.
I'll hold.
This might be the ideal time to leave for that brunch.
The last Mother's Day I spent with my mama was back in Virginia.
Mama'd been ill for some time, and she was recovering in a convalescent home.
It was a lovely place.
Stay right there.
I want you to watch the proper way for a lady to make an entrance on the arm of a handsome gentleman.
You look just wonderful, Mama.
- Happy Mother's Day.
- Oh, is today Mother's Day?
Don't you remember?
I called you and told you I'd be here.
Of course.
Of course, Virginia.
No, darlin'.
Virginia couldn't come.
I'm Blanche.
Here.
Look.
I brought you a little present.
Lace handkerchiefs.
My.
You always used to say that there were two things a lady could never have enough of:
Lace handkerchiefs and gentleman callers.
Maybe next Mother's Day' I'll bring you a gentleman caller.
[Bell ringing]
You wanna go have some tea?
Not right now, darling.
Mama, do you remember that Mother's Day that I almost ruined when I ran off to get married?
No.
Sure you do.
I was a senior in high school, and I was madly in love with Deck Boevingloh.
We'd been dating for a month, so it seemed perfectly logical when he dropped by cheerleading practice and asked me to marry him.
Oh, I thought he was a wonderful catch at the time.
He was 40, out of work, twice divorced, had three kids.
But the real reason I wanted to marry him was because his oldest daughter was a rival of mine at cheerleading, and I figured if I married Deck, I'd be her mama... and I could kick her off the squad.
Anyway, I remember the next day, I was in the Rexall when Deck came in lookin' more handsome than I've ever seen him.
Oh!
Black motorcycle boots, skintight Levis, a match in his mouth, and a white T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up to reveal his brand-new Woody the Woodpecker tattoo.
God, I was an idiot.
Anyway, he sauntered over to me at the soda fountain and gave me this long, smoldering' look and said,
"So?"
Oh, I nearly fainted dead-away on the spot.
Next thing I knew,
I was sittin' in that Studebaker racing out toward bayou country.
Deck knew this justice of the peace who specialized in marrying stupid teenage girls from well-to-do families.
Lucky for me, Old Man Montgomery had been in the Rexall that day and overheard us making plans and tipped off you and Daddy.
I don't know how you got there ahead of us.
But when we pulled up to Bubba's Chapel of Bliss... and Tackle Shop,
there you were.
Well, I was ready for the fight of my life, but all you said was, "Why, darlin',
"I just came out here to give you away with my blessing.
"I think marrying Deck might be the best thing in the world for you, Blanche."
Well, at 17, I wasn't about to do anything you wanted me to do.
And you knew that.
I gave Deck back his I.D. Bracelet... that had "Deck" on one side and "Allergic to the Law" on the other,
hopped in the car with you and Daddy, and we took off home.
I asked you if you were mad at me.
You said, "Why, no, darlin'.
This is the best Mother's Day I've ever had."
Don't you remember that, Mama?
Well, I thought that happened to Virginia.
Wasn't Virginia the slut?
No, ma'am.
That was me.
Blanche, that didn't happen on Mother's Day.
That happened Christmas Day.
19... 1949.
You're right.
Hey, that was Christmas D...
You remembered, Mama.
Blanche, there are days when I can't remember who I am, but trust me, I remember every stunt you ever pulled.
That's how I got half the gray hairs on this 85-year-old head.
Honey, you're 89.
Oh, darlin', didn't I ever teach you anything?
No true lady ever tells her age.
Happy Mother's Day, Mama.
- Bye, Charlie.
Thanks for calling.
- Now can we go eat?
No.
I haven't heard from Michael yet.
Fine.
Wait for your phone call.
My blood sugar'll drop.
I'll have a stroke.
This corsage'll live longer than I will.
You know how much it means to a mother to talk to her child on Mother's Day.
One Mother's Day, I spent with somebody else's mother.
On my way back to St. Olaf, I was stuck in this bus station.
Brrr!
You would think I'd almost forgotten what real cold feels like.
- I've gotten used to tropical weather.
- You here all the way from Nebraska?
- Miami.
- Miami.
That closer to Omaha or Lincoln?
Gee, it's great to be home.
They told me I could change buses here for St. Olaf.
- That's right.
- How much?
You want the express or the yokel?
- You mean local?
- I mean yokel.
A family of first cousins plays banjo music as the passengers get on and off.
- Do they take requests?
- No.
Give me the express.
- You got an hour to kill.
- Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for the bus to Northern Falls?
No.
St. Olaf.
I've visited there.
Lovely little town.
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.
Rolling hills, charming homes.
- Yes.
- Full of idiots.
Yes.
What?
I never saw anything like it.
Must be the water.
I grew up in St. Olaf.
Most of my family still lives there.
Oh, no offense, dearie.
I didn't say that everyone there was an idiot.
It just seemed, though, that per capita, they had more than their share.
Oh, well, per capita, you're probably right.
- Do you live in Northern Falls?
- No.
I'm paying my daughter a visit.
For Mother's Day?
Me, too.
Oh, not just my daughter.
All of my children.
They paid for my trip.
They figured it'd be cheaper for me to come here than for all of them to fly there.
They figured that out?
- And they live in St. Olafs?
- Yes.
Oh, you must be very proud of them.
Oh.
I am.
- So, when was it you visited St. Olaf?
- Oh, Lord, it must be 50 years ago now.
I went to a wedding.
A distant cousin of mine married a local St. Olaf girl.
- What was the girl's name?
- Sonja Yongen...
- Yongenfrauliksteinerbrau?
- You know her?
Know her?
I was flower girl at the wedding.
There were no flowers that year because of what happened to Old Man Smith.
He was our town florist.
He was also our town's only blacksmith.
Come to think of it, he was our town's only black man.
When he first moved in, the town council decided to give him a traditional Scandinavian welcome... gathering on his front lawn and singing songs and dressing up in bedsheets.
'Course, coming from Chattanooga, he wasn't familiar with the custom.
He had a heart attack.
He spent most of the summer in intensive care.
After that, when somebody moved in, the town council just handed out peanut brittle... and free passes to the local movie house, which they hoped to build someday.
- Are you all right?
You seem upset.
- [Sighs] I was just thinking
I'm sorry I recently got a hearing aid.
Don't worry.
It hardly shows at all.
At Sonja's wedding, of course without flowers they didn't know what to do and discovered she was on the hayride with Little Lars, not Big Lars.
She yelled, "Whoa!" And jumped right off the wagon.
[Both chuckle]
Either that story is actually funny, or the batteries are going in and out in my hearing aid.
Rose, I want you to know that I think it's very sweet that you're keeping an old lady company like this.
Don't be silly.
I'm enjoying every minute.
Every hour.
I can't believe the buses are so late.
I should call the kids again.
Are you sure you shouldn't call your daughter?
Mother's Day isn't until tomorrow.
She knows I'll be there.
I always am.
- Still, she must be worried by now.
- Rose.
My daughter's dead.
She passed away some time ago.
I go to the cemetery on Mother's Day.
It was always a special day for the two of us.
I like to pretend it still is.
Problem is, this year I don't think I'm going to make it.
- Aren't you feeling well?
- I ran away from the home, and they're about to catch with me.
Are you Anna Eggerman?
Anna, they're worried about you back at the home.
You're gonna have to come with me.
Attention!
Express to Cedar Grove,
River Junction, Northern Falls, now boarding!
For cryin' out loud, Jacob.
There's three people here.
You could've just pointed to the door.
Sheriff, there's been a mistake.
- This woman's my mother.
- I have a telex that says...
I don't care what it says.
She's my mother, and we're on our way home.
If you'll excuse us, we have a bus to catch.
Come on, Mama.
- Thank you, Rose.
- Happy Mother's Day.
It's a really sweet story, Rose.
So sell it to the Reader's Digest.
Let's get outta here.
- [Phone rings]
- Must be Michael.
Hello.
Hello, Michael!
Okay.
That's it.
When she gets off the phone, we're going.
I'm tired of listening to lousy Mother's Day stories.
Sophia, don't you have a story?
I said I was tired of lousy stories.
I wouldn't mind a good one.
Picture it:
Brooklyn, 1957, the second Sunday in May.
I was getting the house ready which mostly meant trying to get my Salvadore into a shirt with sleeves.
- [Radio blaring]
- Turn that thing off and get up.
Mama will be here and you look like a bum.
So, what's the problem?
She already thinks I'm a bum.
- Salvadore.
- What?
Did you get me a present for Mother's Day?
- Why?
You're not my mother.
- I'm the mother of your children.
A thousand nights of begging.
Three times, you said yes.
For that, you want a present?
It's not enough they declare it a national holiday?
- [Knocking]
- That's Mama.
She sees you like this, we'll never convince her to move in.
- Move!
Move!
- Oh, boy.
It's a dark day in Brooklyn today.
Dodgers are moving out, your mother's moving in!
Grandma, here we are.
I'm in a wheelchair.
I'm not blind.
I can see where we are.
And it could stand a good vacuum.
Hi, Dorothy.
Hello, Mama.
Where's Salvadore?
He's hiding from me.
He always hides from me.
The little monkey hates me.
Don't be silly.
Pop is crazy about you.
[Salvadore] Don't lie to your grandmother!
It's a sin!
He's not crazy about you, but he's very fond of you.
He hates me.
The man repairs complicated machinery for a living.
Three times this month, he couldn't set the brake on my wheelchair.
That was a coincidence.
All three times was at the top of the stairs to the Flatbush subway station.
Mama, if Salvadore hates you,
- why does he want you to live with us?
- What?
Salvadore and I would like you to move in.
- I am not moving in.
- Why not?
Let me tell you a story.
Picture it:
Sicily, 1881.
A beautiful, young peasant girl...
- Mama, not another story.
- Sophia, come closer.
Grandma!
You're movin' in.
We think it's best for you.
- You didn't discuss it with me.
- Fine.
Let's discuss it.
There's nothing to discuss!
I'm not moving in.
Dorothy, if I ever do this to you, I want you to shoot me.
Could you put that in writing?
Dorothy, come closer.
Okay, I can solve this problem.
Take me to the top of the stairs again?
I don't want you here, huh?
This is my home.
A man's home is his castle.
- In this castle, I'm the king.
Capisce?
- He's talking nonsense.
- What are you saying?
- I want you to move in.
- You mean that?
- No.
Ah!
Too bad.
You said it.
Happy Mother's Day, Mama.
Please!
Happy Mother's Day, Ma.
Okay, honey, just a second.
Ma, he wants to talk to you.
Hello, Michael.
Have you eaten?
Well, I haven't.
Good-bye.
Let's roll.
Sophia, we can't.
We haven't all gotten our calls.
- Oh, forget it.
She's not gonna call.
- Well, she might.
[Phone rings]
Hello.
Janet, it's so good to hear your voice, honey.
Ma, what are you doing?
Cooking.
If I wait for you to take me, I'll starve to death.
- You're making me feel guilty.
- I know.
It's Mother's Day.
[music continues]
Daddy wanted me to have the party at the Olympia Hotel.
Now, that would've been a bit much.
But a little birthday celebration in the school gym..
...it's so modest, it's almost tacky.
I'm sure it'll be a neat party.
Ah, if it's neat, I'll kill myself.
I want it to be unique, and thrilling, and exciting.
Eighteen is a special year for a girl and I'm looking forward to a very special present from you.
I put money down on a two-dollar birthday card if I can make the payments, it's yours.
Clark, the only thing that I want from you...is you.
Look at Clark.
Isn't that enough to make you sick?
What?
The tuna melt?
Not what he's eating, dummy.
What he's looking at and how.
Hey, Clark.
Hi.
Dude.
[both laughs]
I really like Lana.
Yeah, she's great.
But she sure doesn't like me.
It's too bad.
My daddy always said that if you wanna be somebody in this world you have to make everyone you meet either love you or hate you.
Oops!
Daddy will be here any minute now.
Oh!
And I'm in my leotard.
He's so old-fashioned.
Oh, no no.
Let me take care of that.
Come on.
Tell you what, give me ten minutes and send him over to the Segal Center.
Tell him I'll meet him there, okay?
- Okay, great.
- Thanks.
What does he look like?
He'll be in a silver limo, and that's my daddy.
- Okay, great.
- Thanks.
Bye.
TJ, take care of that for me.
What?
[whirring]
- Sure this is going to work?
- Relax, Arnie.
It's the same kind of bomb we always use.
Once we blow Mr. Danner to the wild blue yonder we're out of here.
Get in, get in.
Let's go.
Go.
[Whoosh]
[upbeat music] [boom]
Who's that?
I don't know.
[tires screech]
- You okay?
- Yeah.
(male #1) Aah!
You alright?
I've felt better.
I don't know, I don't know what you did or how you did it, but there'll be a reward.
Get the young man's address, Barney.
[sirens approaching]
(male #1) Wait!
[car doors close] [camera clicking]
Perfect.
[sighs] [indistinct chatter on police radio]
Sir?
Sir, I'm Clark Kent, with the Shuster University Herald.
I wanted a statement from you as to what happened.
A bomb exploded near my car.
End of statement.
Excuse me.
Okay, Danner.
What are you doing in my town?
Sir?
Sir, could you give me a statement?
Uh, you're from that college, aren't you kid?
Yes, sir.
Look I haven't got time for you right now.
Please.
Miller, please, have these people back off.
Alright, Danner.
I don't think you're gonna be one of my favorite people.
Let me see your badge.
Congratulations, Detective Harris.
I'm gonna see that you have an early retirement..
...beginning next week.
Trembling with fear.
I don't know who's trying to waste you.
I don't give a hoot.
If you waste him first, good luck to you but if you're gonna be blowing each other up do it on your turf.
This is a college town.
Don't want kids getting hurt.
(Sara) Daddy!
- Sara.
- Are you alright?
Oh, sure.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I promise I'll have my doctor send you a note.
Okay.
Clark!
Have you met Clark, Daddy?
Oh, this is Clark?
Yes, we met.
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.
- Nice meeting you, Clark.
- Nice to meet you, sir.
Get Frank from lab to go through this.
And get these kids away from the fire, please.
Detective Harris, can you spare a moment now?
Alright, kid, one question, but I'm busy.
Who's, who's Mr. Danner?
You call yourself a reporter and you don't know who Matt Danner is?
That's Matt Danner.
He's head of one of the biggest crime syndicates on the East Coast.
So what do you think about Sara now?
I'll let you know.
I might find out what crime syndicate she's head off.
I'm afraid, sweetheart, that I'm gonna miss your party.
Oh, Daddy!
Attempts on my life always ruin my day.
Police are gonna give me a hard time and besides, I've got to get back to town and...handle things.
Please be careful, Daddy.
If you can't be good, you gotta be careful.
Happy birthday, baby.
- Yeah?
- Daddy!
Mr. Casey, Jake.
- Something's wrong.
- Yes and no.
Good news is the bomb went off.
Bad news is Mr. Danner didn't go off with it.
Listen, Mr. Casey, this was not our fault.
We'll make it up to you.
I want the both of you back here as soon as possible.
Got it?
Listen to me, Benny..
...Casey's got to be behind it.
Now, use the whole organization if you have to but I want that no-good rat hung out to dry and I want it done yesterday.
Before the cops become my partners.
I'll tell you why not the cops.
Because if they nab him first, then he ends up in a cozy jail protected by bars and lawyers.
Let's save the tax payers some money.
Bring Casey in refrigerated.
[pop music]
# It's a fine mess we're into #
# It's a fine mess #
# It's the kind of mess I'm used to #
# It's a fine mess we're into #
What's your name, good looking?
It's been so long I almost forgot.
Sorry I'm late.
Had to put the paper to bed.
You know, big time reporter stuff.
Ah.
[club music]
Who's that big guy over in the corner, to my right?
(Sara) My bodyguard.
Your bodyguard?
What can I say?
Every time there's an attempt on Daddy's life
I always end up with a bodyguard.
You never told me that your father is...
Matt Danner.
So?
I never told you that Ross Danner is my mother.
Or that Gloria, Lavinie and Claire are my first cousins.
I love my father, and I'm proud of him.
The paper prints a pretty grim picture of him.
They call him head of a crime syndicate.
You know what I think is criminal?
It's people building the hydrogen bomb that can destroy the world.
How about those creeps who are polluting their environment?
Clark, my dad may bend the law every now and then but what he does is nothing compared to the self-righteous, hypocritical politicians who rob us deaf, dumb and blind.
I don't know.
You're a great attorney for the defense but I have to think about it.
Okay.
[music continues]
TJ, if you want to catch me by star light leave your camera behind.
Okay.
I could dance all night.
I can't stay that long.
I have a sociology paper to write before I hit the sack.
I don't believe you.
Good night, Sara.
Clark.
Clark, don't leave me yet.
You still owe me...
my birthday present.
Clark..
[romantic music]
That was a C minus.
Maybe we can try it with your arms around me this time.
That was an A minus.
If you hold me a little tighter, maybe we can get an A plus.
When I get passionate, I'm an animal.
I might cause you bodily harm.
A little pain never hurt anyone.
Good night, Sara.
[sighs]
I can't believe this is happening to me.
Not in the twentieth century.
[dramatic music]
Look, I'll tell you one more time.
When I came to, I ran up to Sara's room, and she was gone.
So I called Mr. Danner immediately then drove to the hospital, I got my head stitched up then went back to the hotel.
So why didn't you call the police?
I don't work for the police.
I work for Mr. Danner.
This is a police station, not a police state.
What right do you have to detain my employee?
What are the charges?
Your daughter's been kidnapped and you're worrying about this punk?
It's none of your business who I worry about.
My daughter wasn't kidnapped, she ran away.
We had a quarrel.
It's her way of punishing me.
She ran away?
And she didn't even pack a suitcase?
Didn't take her purse, her credit cards?
You know she was kidnapped and I have a hunch you know who did it.
Don't leave town, Danner.
You can reach me at the Peabody.
Mr. Danner?
Mr. Danner?
Hi, kid.
Sara's my friend, and maybe I can help.
You really like my kid a lot, huh?
Yes, sir.
At least we've got that in common.
Hop in.
[police siren blaring]
In your opinion...is ripping a man's heart out more painful than cutting his throat?
Forget it.
Superboy.
Excuse me?
Superboy.
That's who I could use right now.
I don't know why he saved me in the first place.
I don't know him.
I never did anything for him.
Maybe I did.
He must feel obligated.
Superboy could find Casey for me like that.
Why are you always looking at your watch?
I'm late now.
I got an appointment at my doctor's to get my stitches taken out.
[whirring]
(Danner) Oh, if you miss it, I'll send you to my vet.
[phone rings] Yes?
This is Casey.
I don't know what rock you're hiding under but I'm gonna find you.
(Casey on phone) Don't count on it.
If we're gonna play hide and seek you don't stand a chance.
First, let me put your daughter on.
Say hello to your daddy, Sara.
Daddy, please help me.
Please help me.
Thank you, Sara.
You're a dead man, Casey.
(Casey on phone) Well, we all have to die some time, Danner.
Even the children we love.
[dramatic music]
What the..
You're either a quick healer, or a bad liar.
What are you talking about?
I'll show you what I'm talking about.
Whoa!
Do you like to fly?
Yeah, only in a 747.
Well, I'm not a wide body
Although, if you find me comfortable
I tire easily.
Where are you taking me?
I don't know you're the pilot.
Just point me to the direction Casey's holding Sara and I'll take you there.
Casey who?
Whoa!
Think you can remember what Casey I'm talking about?
I work for Mr. Danner!
- I'm getting impatient.
- Whoa!
He's on a yacht.
A rented yacht.
Somewhere in the Marina.
I don't have time for somewhere.
You point me.
Okay, okay.
Now, can we discuss this as reasonable men?
Go to hell.
I can't oblige.
I've got business in this state.
Your business.
Over my dead body.
If necessary.
That's the way you ran the Dutchman out of town and that's our tradition in our line of work.
[dramatic music]
- Is that the Marina?
- Yes.
Which yacht?
That's her.
[siren blaring] [tires screeching]
crash
I'll tell you what, here's the deal.
Why don't you find yourself a nice little place to live out of town?
Like in Europe?
I'll give you five percent of the take, plus your daughter.
I'm not giving up what I worked for all my life for anything.
Now, shove your offer!
Sara, it's time to say goodbye to your daddy.
Daddy, give him what he wants!
Don't let him kill me!
Sara, were-were you listening?
[sobbing] Daddy, give him what he wants!
Listen, Sara.
I can't turn the syndicate over to him but he's not going to kill you.
You're just a bargaining chip.
You be brave.
We'll find him.
Jake!
Look at that.
That's, that's the guy!
Casey, it's him!
The guy with the red cape!
Mr. Casey!
Let's get out of here.
[theme music]
Stop!
Take one step, I'll blow the girl to bits.
Now, freeze!
Freeze.
Good idea.
[wind blowing]
Ugh!
Aah!
Superboy, what's going on here?
This is your kidnapper.
I suggest you arrest him and take him down to headquarters to defrost him.
I wish you weren't leaving school.
I need to get away, and get my head straight.
I'm gonna miss you.
What do you think you're doing?
Please, leave us alone.
Please.
Sara, you can't leave me.
You left me first.
I would have been dead.
If it wasn't for Superboy, I would've been dead.
(Danner) Oh, no, no.
We would've made some arrangement sooner or later.
"Sooner or later".
How comforting!
I want you out of my life, Dad.
Where, where are you going?
Some place.
Any place.
Doesn't even matter.
Goodbye, Dad.
[engine revs]
You really liked her, didn't you?
Yeah, I liked her.
Did you guys, um...ever spend the night together?
That's sick!
What kind of question is that?
That's rude.
Sorry.
You don't have to answer.
I won't.
- But if you want to know--
- No, I don't.
- I'm telling you anyway.
- No.
It never went beyond a passionate kiss.
[theme music]
Captioned by Grant Brown
Three and a half weeks, two continents, five countries, one island, about 9, 000 miles, and I was wasted.
Right now I was looking forward to miles and miles of nothing happening except sleep.
Welcome home!
No.
Oh, the man's overcome with emotion.
No, just overcome.
It's nice to be back, great to see you, but I need to get some sleep.
Now.
Not so fast.
I have fantastic news.
I don't want to hear it, Jack.
I just want to sleep.
So goodbye, Jack.
Go home, Jack.
Actually, this is home.
Temporarily.
A reversal of fortune, pileup of evil coincidences.
I knew you wouldn't mind, so I sort of moved in.
Lucky I did too because, old buddy, best pal, we have hit the jackpot.
I taped this with my own lily whites, from the 1 1.00 news.
Jack!
The answer is no.
No rescue missions, no buried treasure, no sunken gold, no oil wells.
- No.
- You're right, MacGyver.
You're a practical man.
You're gonna love this.
Jack, I don't want to see anything.
- Please.
- I just taped the high points.
And here they are, the Lupescu jewels.
Emeralds, rubies, diamonds.
The most famous relics of a royal family, purchased earlier today at the Warwick Auction for $32 million.
The reported buyer is one of the world's wealthiest women, Elena Iturbe, heiress to a shipping fortune and alleged to be the mysterious purchaser of these fabulous treasures.
What?
No!
Oh, I just taped over some old movie.
My classic Western collection!
Oh, sorry.
Forget the past because, my boy, we have a future.
With those royal jewels?
- No.
- Of course, no.
Never mind small things.
We have a future with Ms Elena Iturbe.
She flew in for that auction, used some petty cash to buy those pretties.
The pilots of her private jet went south.
I don't want to hear this.
I checked it out at the airport.
Kosher, A-OK.
- The plane's there.
We're signed up.
- What about her flight crew?
Lost, strayed, stolen.
Who cares?
We, old buddy, are on.
Jack, I just got off an aeroplane.
- No!
- It's more than a job.
It's an opportunity.
We talked about starting an airline, small at first, growing, building it into something.
- Air Dalton.
- Yeah.
It's my dream, all I ever wanted in the world.
Jack...
I know I pulled you into hassles.
You've bailed me out, I owe you.
Our friendship's worth something.
The Iturbe money is real.
The lady is real.
It's legit.
Oh!
Oh!
It's her.
Oh, come on.
Come with me.
Just one fun trip to Toulon, France.
Excuse me.
- Hello, Ms Iturbe.
- Captain Dalton.
- Come right in.
- Thank you.
You must be MacGyver.
- Elena Iturbe.
- It's a pleasure.
What a charming place you have here, Captain Dalton.
Glad you like it.
We're ready to leave.
I filed flight plans.
- Good.
- Ms Iturbe, about this...
I'm most happy to have you aboard.
Captain Dalton has told me a great deal about you.
I'm all packed.
- I'll get the plane warmed up.
- Good.
Miss Iturbe, I'm Simon Warwick.
It's a privilege to meet you in person.
Thank you.
I imagine you wish to see my identity.
Hardly necessary.
- Do you have everything prepared?
- Of course.
Your attorneys approved the sale contract.
It's not their money, nor their jewels.
May I see them, please?
Yes.
Quite correct.
Designed for a queen.
Fitting, for a princess.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr Warwick.
Can I help you with that?
The jewels?
They're not heavy.
Beautiful, but not heavy.
Did you see them on television?
- Oh, yeah.
- And what did you think?
I think it's kind of a flashy way of telling people you're rich.
- You don't approve?
- Probably just jealous.
- Ready for immediate takeoff.
- Good.
- Stop!
- Thieves!
Get out of here, Jack!
That's my boy.
Up, up and away.
Oh, you were both marvellous!
I have a radiophone in my cabin.
I'll notify the authorities.
Dalton, MacGyver, thank you.
Air Dalton lives!
Dalton is asleep.
Well, it's my shift.
He might as well.
He trusts you.
And you trust him.
That was obvious from the way you two worked together to handle those thieves.
Especially in defence of a woman of whom you don't really approve.
- Now what gave you that idea?
- Oh, you made it quite clear.
And Dalton told me about you.
Apparently, you would rather give $32 million to medical research.
Yeah.
But then that's probably why you own the plane, and I'm just flying it.
We'll be landing in a few hours.
What then?
Oh, I shall probably go into my wine cellar and choose a bottle of truly exceptional champagne and sit on my terrace and congratulate myself on my acquisition.
What are you going to do with those jewels?
Wear them, exhibit them, sell them for a profit, anything I choose.
You would probably give them to a campaign for hunger.
Yeah.
And save a few lives?
For what?
Six months?
A year?
Until they breed more starving children and the money runs out, then what?
Then you'd have bought another year.
You can do a lot in a year.
As you said, it is my money.
You know, my grandfather used to say,
"If you're afraid of the answer, don't ask the question."
Notify me when we make the landing approach.
I've arranged to be met.
Yes, ma'am.
There she is, Toulon, France.
Better ask Miss Iturbe if she needs any help.
Hi.
Thought I'd let you know we'll be landing in about five minutes.
Good.
I've arranged to be met.
I'm anxious to avoid the press, which will be waiting for me like a pack of wolves.
- Hello?
- Robert, it's Elena Iturbe here.
We are landing in Toulon now.
Very good.
The helicopter will be there in five minutes.
Merci.
Take the plane to the terminal and check it in.
Then go to the Metropole Hotel, and I will contact you there.
Will do.
Here they come.
I anticipate champagne, flashbulbs and, with any luck, local beauty queens panting after my highly trained pilot's body.
Bonjour!
I guess you're expecting us.
Yes, we were.
You are under arrest.
Excuse me, but do you know who we are?
Yes.
Two American thieves.
And I am Inspector Andres.
And where is the woman?
Elena Iturbe?
No, Mr MacGyver.
Miss Iturbe, the real Elena Iturbe, has been discovered in her hotel suite, in your country, bound and gagged, with her real flight crew, her passport and papers stolen by your accomplice.
Where is she?
Where are the jewels?
Hey, wait.
Hold it.
Momentito, s'il vous plait.
Miss Iturbe hired us.
And if you're trying to run some hustle...
Jack!
Shush.
Inspector, what Jack means is, we were under the impression the woman we were working for was Ms Iturbe.
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah.
You used a woman who resembled Miss Iturbe to commit a brilliant robbery.
My congratulations.
Look, with all due respect, maybe if we talked to your superior...
This is my investigation.
When I recover the Lupescu jewels, I can expect a promotion.
Perhaps a medal.
And I have no intention of sharing this opportunity.
Then as an American citizen, I demand a call to my embassy.
There are no Americans here.
Only prisoners.
They are truly stunning.
You did a fantastic job, Liane.
Or should I call you Elena?
Thank God that's over.
But it was almost a disaster.
I had to hire a pair of pilots at one day's notice.
- What do you mean?
- The two you hired didn't show up.
I apologise, Liane.
How did you find replacements?
I used my contacts.
I found Jack Dalton.
He flew the U.S.-Mexican border, bit of smuggling, but nothing serious.
He had his papers and his passport, and he was hungry.
Resourceful.
And his copilot?
He brought in a friend, MacGyver.
A sort of soldier of fortune, I gather.
- I'll check them out.
- But what about the buyers?
Coming in later today.
Bulging with cash
- and ready to bid.
- How much do you think we'll get?
A lot.
Listen to me.
Would thieves file a flight plan?
Show him in immediately.
You can explain from the beginning to Mr Brosz,
Miss Iturbe's head of security.
Excellent, all he has to do is listen to reason.
So these are the men who attacked us when we tried to retrieve the jewels?
You even eluded Miss Iturbe's security at the airport.
I see.
I see!
No, it was a big misunderstanding.
- We thought...
- Enough!
Take them to the interrogation centre.
Inspector, Miss Iturbe is a very influential and gracious lady.
She's only interested in recovering the jewels.
Not in any methods you may find it necessary to take.
- Do we understand each other?
- Completely.
- 'Morning, Helen.
- 'Morning.
- Has MacGyver called in yet?
- Not since I've been in.
But there's a message blinking on your private line.
And no, I didn't listen in.
Thanks a lot.
Hi, Pete.
I'm calling early, but I wanted to make sure you got this.
So do me a favour, will you?
Sit down.
Thanks.
Pete, something came up, and I...
Well, I sort of took off, with Jack.
Dalton?
!
Pete?
Sit down.
This is completely legitimate.
He is nothing but trouble.
I know, he is nothing but trouble, but this is really important to him.
We've hired on to ferry Ms Elena Iturbe back to Toulon, France, in her private jet.
Jack needed a copilot, and I was kind of elected.
I didn't figure you'd miss me.
I'll be back tomorrow.
- What?
!
- So don't worry.
And it's a real big shot for Jack.
This is his big chance.
- After, Dalton Airlines will take off.
- What are you involved in?
Don't get all shook up.
Just relax.
Dalton.
Dalton!
Helen!
Yes, sir?
Get me on the first available flight for T oulon, France.
Yes, sir.
Dalton!
She looked the part.
She had Elena Iturbe's passport.
- Why wouldn't we believe her?
- Be quiet.
Stupidity irritates me.
I have three dozen men out searching for your female accomplice.
But I'm not going to waste the time.
You are going to lead me to her.
Do you know what this is?
Sure, that's electrical shock torture.
Put a bunch of voltage through a human body.
It's usually against the law.
It is also very painful.
You burn internally.
Sometimes bones break in convulsions.
- Not pleasant.
- No, you can't!
I mean, it's crazy!
Torture's illegal.
I can't stand pain.
What do you want me to say?
- The truth is, he conned me into it!
- You gutless, whining little wimp!
Right now!
- Care to dance?
- No, thanks.
Taxi!
So how do we get out of this country?
We don't.
We're crooks until we square with the police, which means we should get a line on those jewels.
MacGyver, we're wanted criminals, we broke out of a torture chamber by slugging an inspector and the head of security for the richest woman in the universe.
We got no choice.
Either we're innocent, or we're dead.
There's a third way.
This place has to be full of folks who don't like les cops.
Maybe we could hire some help.
What, local crooks?
And stay on the wanted list?
- Forget it.
- We don't know the territory.
We don't know this con woman's real name.
We don't know where she...
What?
Your light just went on.
Give.
The police already eliminated a lot of territory, and we know things they don't.
Like she took off in a chopper and is probably in Sweden or Africa?
It's not likely.
That chopper took off and reached us at the runway here in exactly five minutes.
Figure air speed of 1 20 miles per, it came a little less than ten miles which means it took off from...
along this line.
OK, it's not Sweden, but it's still a lot of territory.
Yeah.
But we know it came in south by southwest, so we trace back north by northeast intersects... here.
There's a church and a winery.
Oh, I shall probably go into my wine cellar and choose a bottle of truly exceptional champagne...
Winery.
Winery.
What is it?
"I'll go to the cellars and choose a fine bottle of champagne and congratulate myself."
She's got to be here.
Looks like at least two armed guards on duty.
OK, so I guess knocking on the front door is out.
Let's try this way.
- Take a look.
- Alarm system?
There might be more.
This guy's kind of nervous for a lousy 32 mil in hot ice.
Let's go one at a time, and be careful.
Oh, no!
No, rabbit.
Stay, stay, wait!
Oh, stop.
Stay.
No, back!
Get back!
Stay.
No, you...!
Stop right there!
MacGyver, I presume.
Search for the other one.
- Dalton.
- Who, Jack?
Jack's long gone.
He's gone for help.
We'll see about that.
- Come.
Get him inside.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
You owe me one.
Mr Russell, welcome.
This is my associate, Liane Auber.
Pleasure.
Your deception was very clever.
- Thank you.
- Would you care to step inside, sir?
Look, inspector, I came here because I know MacGyver.
I'm a friend of his.
And he's no thief.
Somehow he's been framed.
The evidence is overwhelming, Mr Thornton.
Besides, we are not certain of either criminal's identity.
They had no passports.
The descriptions you have match MacGyver and Dalton perfectly.
They're criminals, Mr Thornton.
My advice is that you return to the United States.
Not until I see them...
with a lawyer.
When we capture these criminals, we shall have to establish identities.
Question them.
It might be months before they are allowed to see an attorney.
We'll see about that.
Mr Thornton.
Look, I know who you are, but this is a criminal case in my jurisdiction.
Any interference, political or otherwise, and I'll have you deported immediately.
- Is that clear?
- Oh, yes.
Very.
Thank you for your courtesy.
MacGyver!
How did he find us?
And where is Dalton?
- Two excellent questions.
- He knows.
I think we shall cut some answers out of our Mr MacGyver.
What are you talking about?
Torture.
He's talking about torture.
No.
We had an agreement.
The Iturbe woman loses money she can afford to.
But nobody gets hurt, and nobody gets killed.
- I like that.
- Quiet.
Or what?
You'll blow his head off?
No.
Let me make myself absolutely clear.
There is to be no killing.
I will not stand for it.
You won't?
So we just pack up and leave?
No, Liane.
I'm content here.
I'm a respectable landowner, with a staff that's loyal.
I only have two small areas of risk.
Our Mr MacGyver here and now you.
I'm your partner.
I think I just bought you out.
- Nothing else to say?
- Would talking be of any use?
No.
When my auction is over, we will finish this.
Goodbye...
Liane.
Position René at the top of the stairs.
I want no one to come down here.
Immediately, Monsieur Donnay.
All right, I was stupid.
For coming to my rescue?
I kind of appreciate that, actually.
Nevertheless, stupid.
Look, we're not dead.
We've got time to figure a way out of here, and Jack will be back.
Oh, Dalton?
He's an ex-smuggler with the ethics of a weasel.
Yeah.
But he's still my friend.
Donnay called you Liane, is it?
Liane Auber.
I believe in honesty at least when I'm contemplating my own death.
Look, we're gonna get out of here.
Oh.
With some help from your friend Jack?
I doubt it.
You know, I suppose I can understand that.
Your friend plans to kill you.
My friend plans to save me.
Look, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll write you a personal cheque.
Drawn on an American bank.
It's better than cash.
All yours, for one job.
Help a friend of mine out of a minor misunderstanding.
- No.
- All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll throw in a cash bonus.
After the job.
- Why don't we do it?
- Are you crazy?
Let's go.
Hey!
Mon ami.
My friend.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
Mr Brizard.
Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Do come inside.
MacGyver... what are you doing?
If I can get my hands wet, maybe I can wiggle out of this.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
Let's go.
- But we are still prisoners.
Locked in.
- We better work on that.
There is a man with a gun guarding that door.
Maybe we should consider a different way out.
That door is steel.
It is cross-braced and double locked.
I never said it was gonna be easy.
Could you help me?
3,500, 4,000, 4,500, 5,000, right?
- Anytime.
- You!
- You had me slugged!
- No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
But it's not a bad thought.
What I did was put out a reward to have you brought in.
Oh, I'm touched.
Matter of fact, I'm bruised.
Don't tell me.
You're a secret Mediterranean crime boss.
No, what I am is a guy with a few connections in this area.
I used to run a DXS operation here.
And you know what you are?
Trouble.
Now, where is MacGyver?
Well actually, he's...
he's being held prisoner.
Prisoner?
Prisoner?
!
I knew it.
I knew it!
Jack, having you as a friend is a little bit like owning a pet disease.
Are you trying to hint you're upset?
Upset?
Why would I be upset?
Because you've done it again?
One more time, you have conned him into bailing you out of something.
Now he's the one that was deep-sixed.
Probably in a bed of quicksand.
Actually, it's a winery.
He's there with the Lupescu jewels.
A place called the Domaine Donnay.
- I know the place.
- Domaine Donnay?
All right.
Now we're getting someplace.
We learned the diamonds were up for sale, and three heavyweight buyers are coming into Toulon to bid on them.
We couldn't find out where it was gonna take place.
- All you had to do was ask.
- It makes for logic, Peter.
The buyers cross the border legitimately, as wine merchants.
- Can you find them?
- It might be difficult.
- Money's no object.
- Jack!
In that case, two of them have already checked out of their hotels.
You didn't tell me that.
You didn't mention that money was no object.
The third buyer is one August Bauman, from Munich, staying at the Hotel Toulonaise, suite 31 7.
- Who is it?
- Assistant manager, Herr Bauman.
A case of wine has arrived for you, from Monsieur Donnay.
Oh?
You must be a very close friend.
Actually, I have never met him.
But we are to do business together.
- Champagne.
- Only the best for you.
Here it is.
"Herr August Bauman."
Oh, boy.
He's due at Domaine Donnay in less than an hour.
- We can get there in 20 minutes.
- Yeah, and do what?
Well, bust in, find Mac, you know.
How many guards were there?
I saw... five.
Yeah, five.
Figure more.
No, we can't break in.
We've got to get in somehow.
We've got to sneak in.
Disguised as what?
Mother Theresa and a leper?
- Sorry.
- No.
I go in.
As Herr August Bauman.
The third buyer.
Great thought.
Except I'm the one that has to do it.
This needs style, finesse.
A certain, je ne sais quoi.
It needs someone the girl hasn't seen, hasn't described and can't recognise.
And someone the police won't shoot on sight.
Yeah, but...
You're right.
I'm going as the chauffeur.
What's the plan?
All right.
I play Bauman.
I get us past their security.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna have to trust you.
I'll keep the bidding going as long as I can.
You find MacGyver and get him out.
Gotcha.
Herr Donnay?
Bauman.
- Shall we get down to business?
- Certainly.
This way.
Gentlemen...
Herr August Bauman.
- You're late.
- I don't know you.
This is Mr David Russell, Mr Jacques Brizard.
How very interesting.
I prefer that we waste no more time.
- So?
- Very well.
Gentlemen, this way.
Johann... you will remain here.
Are you certain this will work?
Nope.
But when you release gas under pressure, you're using one of the basic laws of physics.
For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
But what about this thing?
It must weigh, what, 1,000 kilograms?
Yeah, you're right.
Haul over another nitrogen cylinder.
We need all the reaction we can get.
But what is the point of all this?
- There are four armed men outside.
- It may be no point at all.
But if Jack's coming at them from outside, I want things equal inside.
- You really think he will come?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Straight ahead, if you will, for our little auction.
Here?
Twelve-inch-thick stone walls.
One door.
No security risks, gentlemen.
To protect... these.
The terms... cash.
They are truly beautiful.
- Delivery guaranteed.
- How?
You will receive a shipment of wine, through normal legal channels.
Concealed inside... the jewels.
- Undetectable.
- Very efficient.
Good.
One last point.
The bidding, U.S. dollars.
Commencing, ten million.
Robert, see to it that Herr Bauman's man is comfortable.
Gentlemen.
Monsieur... what are you doing?
I have $25 million in cash.
Makes me nervous.
- Twenty-five million dollars?
- Yeah.
Don't worry.
We have complete security.
An alarm system and armed men on patrol.
Security?
Your boss told my boss that you had a break-in earlier today.
We caught him.
He's under guard in the wine cellar.
In the wine cellar?
Down there?
Good, that makes me feel better.
Have you ever seen $25 million in cash?
Never.
Show me.
- Twelve million dollars.
- Twelve million five.
- Thirteen.
- Fifteen million.
- Seventeen.
- Ridiculous.
Oh?
Then they are mine?
No.
Eighteen million.
I'm out of it.
- Twenty million.
- Gentlemen... take your time.
Think about Herr Bauman's bid.
Oh, yes.
Take all the time you like.
Wake up!
All right, we have to knock off these valves, simultaneously.
Come on.
I should have knocked.
Jack, I'm glad it's you.
MacGyver!
And the ever-lovely Elena Iturbe or whatever.
- Oh, it's nice to see you again.
- She's with us, Jack.
She's agreed to testify against Donnay.
Let's move before somebody checks on us.
Never fear.
Pete's with Donnay at this moment, buying us time.
- Pete?
- He heard we got our tails in a crack, he came running.
He's one of the auction buyers.
I was supposed to find you.
Which I did...
-...brilliantly.
- In God's name, can we go?
- Where'd he go?
- To tell Donnay Pete's an impostor.
Let's use this thing to get out of here.
- And leave Pete here?
- No way.
Where's this auction?
In the wine-tasting room, the other side of that wall.
Give me a hand.
Easy.
Twenty-two million, five hundred thousand.
This is insane.
I'm finished.
Going... going... gone.
He's not Bauman.
He's a fake.
He came with the other one, Dalton.
Relax, gentlemen.
Dalton?
I locked him in with MacGyver and the girl.
They're not going anywhere.
Well...
I guess this means you're not gonna sell me the jewels.
- So...
- Very amusing.
I don't think so.
Kill him now, let's get on with business.
- Yes.
- I agree.
Goodbye, Mr Bauman.
You know, gentlemen I don't think you really want to do this.
Especially not...
in front of witnesses.
But, sir, we are all accomplices here.
Yeah, I hadn't actually thought of it that way.
Well, certainly going to make a mess of the jewels, aren't we?
Yes.
We wouldn't want your blood splattered all over the jewels, would we?
- That's it.
- I hope this will work.
Yeah, me too.
Stand back.
On three.
One... two three!
Go!
Go!
Now, Robert.
Let's go!
Stop!
- Sorry to bust in on you like this.
- What kept you?
Hey, are we great or what?
What a team.
Since we're here, I heard about this sunken treasure.
Fifty million dollars in Nazi gold.
The ship was torpedoed, and the gold was lost.
All we got to do is get a diving bell and three bathing suits...
What are you guys doing?
It's a magic trick we just saw on tv.
It's called "the 2-Layer pineapple surprise cake in a sun hat trick."
With mom's sun hat?
We couldn't find willie's.
And now, without further ado,
A pinch of yeast...
And 2 eggs.
One, 2.
Does mom know you're using her sun hat?
Silence, please!
Will the young man with the freckles and the overbite
Please mix the ingredients?
She doesn't know, does she?
I'm running this trick on a need-To-Know basis.
Is it done?
Perfect!
Now cover the hat with the plate,
As i say the magic words.
Hacus pacus,
Betty crock-Us.
Ta-Da!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alf's magical 2-Layer pineapple surprise...
Soup.
Captioning made possible by lions gate home entertainment
What are you doing?
It was kate's idea.
I have to write this 100 times.
On the refrigerator?
!
She didn't say.
Allow me to present an alternative
To writing on the major appliances.
What's that?
It's a magic kit.
I thought i'd introduce you
To some less messy tricks.
What do you know about magic?
I dabbled a little when i was your age.
Uh...
Your height.
Really?
Oh!
Oh!
Show me!
Show me!
Well...
Yeah.
Here.
Pick a card.
Any card.
Pick...a card.
I'm gonna tell you what that card is.
I know what the card is.
It's the 9 of clubs.
Pick another card.
Any card.
This time don't tell me what it is.
Fine.
Any...card.
[Sighs]
There.
Happy?
Ok.
Now you take a good look at that card,
And then put it back in the pack.
[Sighs]
All right, now,
I'm going to concentrate
On your thoughts.
A--
Our thought waves are connecting...
I feel the vibrations...
Ha!
Aha!
Is that your card?
Beats me.
Don't you remember?
You said take a look,
Not commit to memory.
Alf, this is your card.
These cards are marked.
Well, you cheated!
I didn't cheat.
You cheated, you lied,
You said that you loved me.
It's not cheating.
It's part of the trick.
Watch.
Wow!
How did you do that?
It's all here.
It's right in here!
Well, can i see?
First, i want you to make
The writing on the refrigerator disappear.
No problem.
Allakazoo, allakazam!
I think this would work better.
Allakazoo, allakazam!
[Engine roars on tv]
Yo, it's showtime!
Actually, alf, it's h.B.O.
Ladies and gentlemen,
May i present...
Alf the stupefying!
Grazie.
What magic have we to look forward to tonight, stupe?
Picture, if you will,
An ordinary flowerpot.
Empty to the human eye.
But one tap with my magic wand,
And the flowerpot becomes...
Big jaggedy pieces of clay.
Ta-Da!
I'll get the dustpan.
Uh, uh--No need!
My lovely assistant will take care of it later.
I guess i'm the lovely assistant.
For my next trick,
I'll need a volunteer from the audience.
Ah, yes!
The lady with the questionable fashion sense!
What's going on?
Alf is being stupefying.
Oh, well, i would love to watch,
But i'm going to the octoplex.
Dad, can i borrow $10?
Well, i guess so.
Sure.
Thanks.
Hey, this is even better!
I'll do the disappearing $10 bill trick.
I think we just saw that.
Young lady,
Please put your $10 bill into this envelope
And seal it.
Ahh, ok.
[Hums man on the flying trapeze]
All done!
Good!
I will now put the envelope,
Containing your $10 bill,
Into my magic pan.
Voila.
A few magic shakes,
And the money will disappear.
It's still there.
Well, so it is.
We'll have to make it disappear the hard way.
Willie, he's got a blowtorch.
I think these matches will do just fine.
Sure, if you don't care about showmanship.
All right,
Light the envelope on fire.
[Hums man on the flying trapeze]
Now, here.
Peel this.
And tell everyone
What you have found embedded inside.
I have found a banana.
No $10 bill?
Um, um, willie!
Please check your wallet
And tell us what you find inside.
Just my 20.
Ta-Da!
Not only did i resurrect that $10 bill,
I doubled it!
Thanks, dad.
I can't spend that.
Hey.
Oh.
I thought you gave up on magic.
Something about being no good at it.
Being no good at something
Is no reason to quit.
Ask anyone at the fox network.
I admire your perseverance.
As long as you're not burning money.
Thanks.
Hey, willie,
You wanna see a trick?
Well, sure.
Ok, uh, first,
I need to borrow a handkerchief.
Well, here we go.
Thanks.
[Blows nose]
I'll also need your watch.
Well, you--You will be careful with it,
Won't you?
Of course.
Well...
All right.
Thank you.
Now you will notice that in one hand
I hold a man's wristwatch.
In the other,
A velvet pouch.
Would you say that the watch is intact, sir?
So far, yes.
Watch this.
I wave my hand over the bag,
Say the magic words,
Hocus pocus,
Go for broke-Us.
And your watch...
Is as good as new.
[Stammers]
I--I don't believe it!
Was that a new watch?
[Muffled groan]
Rabbit.
Huh?
Rabbit on my chest.
[Sighs]
Alf.
The stupefying.
The stupefying.
Alf!
Alf?
Kate!
Willie!
You're just in time to see my newest trick.
Where did these rabbits come from?
Well, first father rabbit
Picked up mother rabbit in the singles' bar.
Then--
You know what i mean.
Where did you get all this stuff?
Buckley's house of magic.
You bought all this?
Rented it, actually.
They gave me the professional discount.
You still want to encourage him?
Aw, come on, kate,
It could be worse.
Ta-Da!
Alf's gonna saw me in half.
Much worse.
Uhh!
You are not going to saw our son.
Yes, i am!
You are not!
Uhh!
But i'm ready for big time.
How long does a guy have to toil
In kiddie tricks?
Maybe until he completes
One or 2 of them successfully.
Maybe he doesn't stand a chance
When all the diagrams favored 5-Fingered magicians.
Maybe he's gotten into something
A little over his head.
Maybe at 3 foot 2,
Everything he gets into is over his head.
Ok, remember how we saw it on tv?
You close the curtain,
And you spin the box around 3 times.
Ixnay on the spinning.
If you puke in that box,
It can't be returned.
You all right in there?
It's all right!
Thank you, junior wences.
I'll say the magic words...
Allakazoo,
Allakazam.
I'll show you what
A hack i am.
Brian?
Yo, "b"!
You in there?
Yes!
Yes!
I came, i saw,
I demolecularized.
I can do magic!
Oh, oh, now i'll make you reappear, "b".
Um...
Uh, abracadabra,
Allakazam.
I'm a better magician than i thought i am!
Uh-Oh.
A glitch in the finale.
Uh, allakazam.
Oh, no.
Uh, i vaporized the boy.
Kate and willie will not be pleased.
Especially since willie told me
Not to do any more tricks.
Oh, wait a minute.
I smell a conspiracy here.
I also smell 8 rabbits cooped up in a garage.
Man!
Whew!
Ok, where is he?
Where's who?
Your little stooge.
Is he hiding under the sink?
Ok, brian!
Come on out!
Simon says!
You know what he's talking about?
Hardly ever.
You really don't know
What i'm talking about, do you?
N-No.
Uh...
Simon says everyone take one giant step
Out to the garage.
Then i said some more magic words,
But when i opened the box,
Brian was gone!
Well, not gone exactly.
Just smaller and fond of salad.
Oh, wait.
Here-- Here we go!
I knew there had to be a secret compartment somewh--
Brian's not here.
Don't deny your son's existence
Just because he's a little different from the rest of us.
Alf, don't be ridiculous.
He is being ridiculous,
Isn't he, willie?
Of course he's being ridiculous.
It's not possible to turn people into rabbits.
Even with magic?
It isn't magic, alf.
It's a trick!
That's your theory.
Honey, he must be in the house somewhere.
Come on.
Let's go look for him.
Don't worry, brian.
You'll get used to the big ear jokes.
Well, thank you, mrs.
Beckham.
If brian does show up,
Will you send him home please?
Ok.
Thanks so much.
Bye-Bye.
Not there, either.
Uh-Uh.
Honey, i don't know who else to call.
I'm sure brian's fine.
Oh.
He wouldn't just run off
Without letting us know.
[Sighs]
Hey kate!
You got any carrots left?
Your son looks hungry.
Alf, did you get that cage from brian's room?
That's right.
What did you do with the snake?
What are you so worried about the snake for?
We're talking about
Your own fur and blood here!
Kate, when you checked in brian's room,
Did you look under the bed?
N-No.
Well, i'm sure he's under there
Playing cave dwellers again.
Watch out for the snake!
He was pretty mad when i dumped him out.
Brian?
Brian?
Do you understand me?
Um...
Hop once for yes,
Twice for no.
Hi, alf.
How did you do that?
You didn't even move your little rabbit lips.
Rabbit lips?
Brian!
You're not a rabbit!
[Door opens]
Oh, brian!
Hi, dad.
Where have you been?
I was hiding in the car.
But i got hungry.
Why were you hiding in the car?
I wanted alf to think he made me disappear,
So he wouldn't think he's a bad magician.
Oh!
Oh, honey.
It was nice of you not to want alf to feel bad,
But we were very, very worried about you.
Yeah!
I thought i turned you into a rabbit.
Sorry, mom, dad.
Sorry, alf.
I guess i messed up the trick.
That's ok, bri.
Now you can clean up your own pellets.
A very large snake just slithered
Into my gym bag.
Somebody please do something.
You better not have scared captain eo.
Go.
As soon as we're finished here,
We're gonna pack up all the rabbits,
And all the magic boxes,
And we're gonna send them back
Whence they came, right?
Right.
Oh, alf.
You didn't have to bring us breakfast in bed!
It was the least i could do,
After i almost misplaced your son and everything.
Say, i'm sorry the magic thing didn't work out.
That's ok.
I've thought about it,
And i believe my true calling in life
Is to build powerful fireworks displays.
If you need me, i'll be on the phone
With buckley's house of gunpowder.
Alf!
Captioning made possible by lions gate home entertainment
Alf: ah!
Ha ha ha ha!
'Ere, Mungo, he's dead!
Course he's dead.
He's just been viciously and gratuitously stabbed by an unknown assailant.
Yeah, but you didn't have to use my knife, did you?
I mean, what happens if someone walks in here?
What happens if Badvoc walks in?
He'll take one look at me with a blood- stained dagger, dead Roman at me feet, and he'll say, "Blag, why did you kill that Roman?"
Blag, why did you kill that Roman?
I was just saying -
Shut up, Blag...
Mungo, what's going on?
It would seem that his Roman 'ere came -
Shut up, Mungo.
Well, this is charming, isn't it?
I come back to me local drinking din, after a hard day terrorising neighbouring tribes, and I can't get to the bar for dead Romans.
He committed suicide.
He was depressed, homesick -
- Mungo...
- Shut up.
Correct.
Look at it from my point of view.
I'm the tribe leader.
I'm in a position of trust.
The Romans rely on me to keep the peace here in Chelmsford.
I mean if we went round stabbing Romans whenever we felt like it there'd be no Romans left... to stab whenever we felt like it.
Uh, Blag, apologise.
- Sorry, Badvoc.
- Not to me.
To our ex-Roman friend.
- Sorry.
- Properly.
Sorry about you being dead, Marcus.
Marcus?
They're all called Marcus, in't they?
'Ere, Mungo?
I don't think Marcus is gonna need financial support where he's going.
Oh, right.
Right, lads, the drinks are on the wop.
Ah.
And then the other fella says, "Thank God for that.
I thought me hump had burst."
Badvoc?
- Ah, Functio.
- Can we have a word in private?
Eh?
Don't worry about this lot.
Just use words of more than two syllables.
They won't understand.
There's been a general breakdown in law and order.
Your men are swaggering around Chelmsford brandishing swords.
Now, there's a law against that.
The Lex...
Lex um...
The Lex Iulia de Vi Publica which forbids Brits from carrying offensive weapons without authorisation.
- Yes.
- Never heard of it.
Yes, well, I've just seen one of the Roman garrison butchered.
Literally butchered by one of your men.
Butchered by one of my men?
Which one?
Ralph.
Oh, that's all right.
He's a butcher.
He's got a stall down the market place.
Blag, drink for Functio.
Oh, all right.
How's that, then?
You think you've got problems.
Go on, shift up.
It's no use trying to get round me, Badvoc.
I've known you too long.
When I first came here ten years ago from Rome to serve with the Ninth Legion there was peace, we lived in harmony.
That's why I settled here, that's why I married one of your tribe.
I thought it was because you put her up the duff.
Functio, OK, listen...
Look at it this way.
Did we ask to be invaded?
- No.
- No.
And besides, before your lot came it was Briton killing Briton.
Now it's Briton killing Roman.
- So you see, for us it's progress.
- Exactly.
Yes, well, I've sent word to Rome.
A new governor must be sent forthwith.
We don't need a new governor.
We've managed perfectly well since the last one...unfortunately...
- Departed.
- ...departed.
Departed?
Dispatched, more likely.
It was an accident.
- He, uh, choked.
- Choked.
On his own foot?
Well, I told him he shouldn't bite his toenails.
Uh, game of Knucklebones, anyone?
Be careful, Badvoc.
The next man they send might just bring you to your knees, begging for mercy.
Baa!
It's very kind of you, Badvoc, to play Knucklebones with a poor old blind man.
All part of my duty as your tribal chief.
Yeah, it is very nice of him, 'cause a lot of people must take advantage of your lack of sight in games of chance.
Mungo, isn't there a tin mine you can fall down?
Right, my throw.
Oh, bad luck, Badvoc.
Double dog.
Bad luck, Blag?
What can you mean?
That's a double Venus, the highest available score in Knucklebones.
Another double Venus, Badvoc!
Amazing luck you're having.
Yes, the gods are smiling on me.
It's all in the wrist, you see.
I have good news - the new governor has landed in Britain, and is on his way.
Thought you had some good news.
It is good news for every right- thinking person in this province.
Both of them?
Get your swords now.
Finest weaponry.
Badvoc!
Look at that sword.
Finest weaponry.
Cut through a Roman like butter.
Finest...cutlery.
Cut through butter like butter.
Not just now, Ankroll.
Thanks.
All right, mate.
But the best news of all - the man they've sent is Aulus Paulinus.
A fine general and an old friend, and this calls for a celebration.
That's very good of you.
A mug of ale for me and Mungo, and a bucket for Blag.
This one 'ere, Badvoc, it's a work of art.
It will turn a massacre into a masterpiece.
I'm not interested.
It's so sharp it will slice through a man without him even knowing it.
What's the point of that?
When I slice through somebody I want them to know about it.
I want -
Badvoc, a toast to the future in which Romans and Britons live in harmony.
The future.
This man Aulus Paulinus, what sort of bloke is he, then?
Oh, he's an amazing man.
He's courageous, bold...
He has the heart of a lion.
The eyes of a hawk.
I see.
He collects bits of animals, does he?
You'll need more than your dry British humour when Aulus Paulinus gets here.
Here, Ankroll...
I want some of your finest swords.
These ones are real beauties.
Razor-sharp.
One quick launch, and it's in.
Look.
Look at this.
What do you think?
It's not bad.
Not bad?
Not bad?
!
Look at the craftsmanship on that handle.
Oh, all right, I'll have half a dozen.
Right.
That'll be...500...sesterce.
500 sesterce?
That's a bit steep, innit?
I've got to make a living, haven't I?
Oh, all right.
- I'll pay you when I see you.
- Right...
That Ankroll, great salesman.
I reckon the job's killing him.
Can't you go any faster?
Come on, you lazy scum - pull!
Pull!
Please...
Why do we have to have German slaves pulling our chariot?
Because they're more economical than Gauls, that's why.
You get more miles to slave with a German.
This rain, my God!
When I think of the years I spent trying to cultivate a good tan, and what happens - I end up in this shitholey.
This what?
Shitholey.
I think you'll find the word's pronounced shith-ole.
Shith-ole.
Stupid language.
Why do we have to speak it anyway?
It's the Treaty of Occupation.
When in Rome...
These peasants should be forced to learn Latin, otherwise it'll end up as a dead language.
- Rubbish.
- Look at that!
What does that mean?
Piss off Romans.
I'm not familiar with the construction.
It's something Romani, isn't it?
Uh...piss off...
It's probably a word of welcome, yes.
Like we say salvete Romani, they say "Piss off, Romans".
- Piss off, Grasientus.
- Piss off, Aulus.
I like that.
Piss off, Romans.
Come on, Badvoc.
Hurry up and throw.
Badvoc?
Well, say something.
Oh, my God!
I've gone deaf as well as blind.
Help!
Somebody?
He's gone.
Thank heavens for that.
Is this one dead?
Badvoc?
Badvoc?
Where is he?
Where's Badvoc?
After he bought the swords off Ankroll he went off with some of his colleagues.
Talking about a welcoming committee for the new Roman governor.
Oh, my God!
This is bad news.
There's gonna be big trouble.
I must get some of the veterans together.
There could be bloodshed.
Drink before you go?
For God's sake, man!
The new governor's about to be ambushed and killed by the local tribal leader, leading to what could be full-scale war, and all you can talk about is drink!
Oh, my God, this is terrible!
I need a drink.
So much for your tough German slaves.
Well, how was I to know they all had defective hearts?
Look, just shut up and push.
- You mean shut up and pull.
- Yes, whatever.
Bloody stupid language.
Agghhh!
What is it now?
I've got a splinter in my finger.
It's tiny.
Ridiculous.
Look, just hold still.
Look, there we are.
There we are, there...
Salute Romani.
Nos multi...
- multi-syme...
- Multissime.
Multissimay...
What's happening?
He's trying to speak Latin.
Uh, no...
Fellow?
It's all right.
You see... we...speak...
British.
Oh, charming.
I am Badvoc, leader of the Trinovantes.
We are here to welcome you to Chelmsford.
Hello.
As a token of our goodwill we would like to bestow upon you these six swords crafted by our finest swordsmith, the great Ankroll.
- The late Ankroll.
- Shut up.
Well, well, well...
What great kindness.
We are indeed honoured to be greeted in such a way.
We had heard that you Britons were a rough, dishonourable bunch.
These gifts, well...
Agghhh!
My friends, get down!
It's a trap!
I will save you.
Fear not!
Functio, what the hell are you doing here?
Badvoc, stop this ambush at once.
Functio, you pillock - it's not an ambush, it's a welcoming committee.
What about the swords?
A welcome to Chelmsford present, you great wassock.
Oh, dear...
Sorry.
You've killed two of my men.
I'm sorry, Badvoc.
Two of my best men.
I have done you a great wrong.
You certainly have.
I paid them in advance.
I wonder if they've spent it yet.
Let's have a look.
Welcome to Wass' Tavern.
Ugghh!
This is no place for the human being.
You should be all right, then, shouldn't you, Grasientus?
Aulus, mate, come and meet some of the tribe.
- Mungo.
- Greetings.
I didn't catch the name.
- They call me Mungo the Contradictory.
- Do they?
No.
He's got a wicked sense of humour.
- Greetings, fellow.
- Hello, Marcus.
Marcus, this is Blag.
Ah, Blag.
That's an odd name, isn't it?
Is it short for something?
Yeah, it's short for the great fat dozy git Blag.
- Ah, drink, gentlemen?
- Excellent.
This is our taverner Wass.
- Greetings.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Does he do that all the time?
- Yes.
A nervous tick.
Oh, there you are, you see.
That's the source of my confusion.
When he said you'd taken the swords - wink wink - to give to Aulus - wink wink -
I thought...
You're a pillock, Functio.
Yes, my wife says that.
Ah, Gargamadua.
Hello, there.
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as the girlfriend of the local tribal leader, it seems only right I should meet the Governor.
- What's it got to do with you?
- You never know...
He might take a fancy to me.
What?
He might ask me to go and work at the Governor's villa.
Could be useful for you to have a spy in the Roman headquarters.
Don't be ridiculous.
If you had to work for him, and were in his... and he...
That's very clever for a woman.
- You should have been a man, you know.
- So should you.
Pardon?
I'm sure he could find a position for me.
I'm sure he could find several.
You know what these Romans are like - he probably just wants to give you one, dirty -
Aulus, this is my betrothed, Gargamadua.
You're a very fortunate man, Badvoc.
I am ashamed, Gargamadua, to have only human words at my disposal.
Fragile and inadequate attempts to describe your pulchritude.
I doubt very much that nature's magic wand could conjure up a replica of such peerless beauty.
He wants to give me one.
Yeah.
OK, Aulus, I'm sure my betrothed is very honoured by your kind words.
Go and make me dinner.
Aulus, now that the elders are assembled
I think it right that you say a word or two.
How about goodbye?
Shut up, Grasientus.
People of Chelmsford...
I am overwhelmed by the warmth and affection of this welcome.
I...
I know that Britain is not as great as Rome, although I predict that one day she will be as great as...
Syria.
Or Cappadocia, or perhaps, who knows, even Malta.
And so, in honour of this auspicious occasion,
I would like to give you a greeting in your own fair tongue.
And so I say to you, Britons... piss off.
to a dreadful dynasty of vicious vampire ducks.
The Counts of Duckula!
Legend has it that these fowl beings can be destroyed... by a stake through the heart or exposure to sunlight.
This does not suffice, however... for they may be brought back to life... by means of a sacred rite... that can be performed once a century... when the moon is in the eighth house of Aquarius!
- Batswing blood.
- I'll get it!
The latest reincarnation did not run according to plan.
Ooh!
In the heart of Transylvania
In the Vampire Hall of Fame, yeah
There's not a vampire zanier than
Duckula
He won't bite beast or man
'Cause he's a vegetarian
And things never run to plan for
Duckula
If you're lookin' for some fun
You can always count upon
The wild and wacky one they call
Duckula
Heh heh!
Count Duckula!
Heh heh heh!
Oh, foolish, foolish, viewer.
Have you in your folly followed me to this fowl fortress of fear and affliction?
Turn back.
Turn back before...
But, no, it is too late.
For even now, strange and blood curdling cries rent the air.
Come on, come on.
It's all right.
Nanny's coming.
No, Nanny, it's all right.
I didn't mean...
Whatever is it, my little Duckypoos?
It's my wall, Nanny, again.
Why couldn't you come through the door?
Oh, those stupid things.
They always gets in the way when you're in a hurry.
I come to save you.
I heard your cry for help.
I wasn't crying for help.
I was watching auto racing on television.
And look what you've done to the set.
Auto racing.
Ha.
Yes, Igor, auto racing.
Ha.
I wish your lordship would watch something more educational... like "Blood Grouping for Ghouls"... or even "The Slavering Monster from the Vampire's Blood Bath...
Meets the Limb Tearing Werewolf."
Yuck.
Well, you don't have to worry, Igor... because I won't be watching anything until we get a new television set.
So, just call the shop in the village and tell them to send one up.
I fear, milord, that that will not be possible.
Hmm?
Not possible?
You still haven't paid for that one.
Look, Igor, are you trying to tell me that we haven't paid the bills?
Exactly, sir.
And we haven't paid the butler or the nanny, either, milord.
Igor, you're not trying to tell me that I do not have any money?
Alas, milord, that is the awful truth.
This is awful.
But the truth.
Oh, and I'm missing the auto racing, and I do want...
Hey.
Hey, wait a minute.
Ooh, dear.
Not a good idea, sir?
Yes, Igor, a good idea.
The world land speed record comes to Transylvania.
I see.
And when was that, sir?
Huh?
No, no, Igor.
I mean I'm going to make it come to Transylvania.
I mean I am going to build an automobile... and I'm going to drive it... and I am going to bring the world land speed record... right here to Transylvania.
I see, sir.
Why?
W-Why?
Because I'll be famous, that's why.
Because people will come here in their thousands... to see me break the record.
Because when they do, they won't have anywhere to stay but here... and because by the time they've finished paying me for bed and breakfast...
I'll be rich, rich, rich.
There is just one thing, milord.
Yes, Igor?
What is it?
We don't actually have an automobile.
Igor, get me the Transylvanian Times.
We already have a copy, milord.
On the phone, Igor, on the phone.
The world must hear of this bold, courageous... thrilling, ingenious... moneymaking venture right now.
Um, but I didn't know you got the Transylvanian Times, Ruffles.
I get it for the crossword.
Now shut up and listen.
Yes, guv.
Sorry, guv.
"From our special correspondent.
"An attempt is to be made...
"to bring the blue ribbon of the automotive world... to Transylvania."
Cor.
Ho ho.
Yeah.
Are they anything like Bruce Springsteen?
Are they...
Who?
Is who anything like Bruce Springsteen?
Well, this blue rib-band.
You brainless lump.
- Yeah.
- Blue ribbon!
It's like the victor's laurels, like... the gold medal.
Yeah.
I like Victor Laurel.
- You what?
- I like Victor Laurel.
I like him better than...
What's his name?
Hardy.
Oh, sprite me up the old apples and pears.
Why did I have to get mixed up with you lot?
Why couldn't I just have got run over by a bus?
- Aah!
- Shut up and listen.
Uh, yes, guv.
Sorry, guv.
"To bring the blue ribbon of the automotive world to Transylvania.
Count Duckula..."
- Ah.
- Ah.
"Count Duckula announced today that he is constructing...
"the world's most powerful v-vehicle...
"in which he will attempt to beat...
"the land world speed record early next month.
Already thousands of tourists..."
"are flocking to view the attempt... and the accommodation is at a premium."
- Right, Bert.
- Um, yeah?
Nip home and forge us a set of airline tickets for Transylvania.
Right, guv.
The rest of you get packed.
We're going on a little holiday... a working holiday.
What we laughing for?
Uh, are you sure this will be all right at seven hundred miles an hour?
It is wind tunnel tested, milord.
Is that when you stood it in the corridor... and fanned it with your hat?
- Silence, Nanny.
- Only bits fell off it then.
Bits fell off it?
Part of the fine tuning for ultimate performance, milord.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, well.
I suppose there's only one way to see if it works... and... and... and... and that's to give it a test ride.
OK, start the engine.
Engine?
I assume it has got an engine.
Uh, Mark One, milord, is hen powered.
Oh.
Oh, dear.
Oh, well, right-o.
Go ahead and... and try it.
Oh, just... just one thing before you do.
- Where's the steering wheel?
- Unh!
Drat.
There are so many little things to remember.
Right.
Just let me do a checkpit cock.
Are you sure that's what you mean, milord?
Yes, of course it's...
No, no.
No, of course it's not what I mean.
L...
I mean let me do...
let me do a chockpit chick.
A pitstop chuck.
A pa pot chick chock.
- Ahem.
I tell you what, Igor.
- Milord?
I'll just make sure everything's OK, OK?
Steering wheel.
Every luxury.
Handbrake on.
Seat belts fastened.
Ooh, yes.
We don't want to lose the seats.
Yes, thank you, Nanny.
OK, I'm ready to go.
- Go, milord?
- Right you are, Mr. Igor.
Now, then, just as soon as I have released the hand brake...
Ooh, Nanny, Nanny.
So, where's all the tourists, eh, landlord?
Oh, bless your red corpuscles.
They all gone home, sir.
Gone home?
Oh, they was here in their thous... in their hun...
There was seven of them... but they said they couldn't hang about forever, sir.
Are you trying to tell me that there ain't no tourists?
Oh, well, they came to see the Flying Duckmobile... break the record, didn't they?
Well, yeah.
And he ain't never got it going, has he?
- Is that right?
- Ar, right it is.
Well, no, right is what it isn't... and when they couldn't see no Flying Duckmobile... they buzzed off, didn't they?
They only been gone a couple of days though.
So, if we'd blooming well flown to Transylvania via Italy... instead of flaming Vladivostok on your blooming forged tickets... we'd have been in time to rip 'em off, you twillip!
Yeah, well, I can't spell Rome.
You... you're about as good as that idiot Duckula with his blooming...
Here...
Here, hang about.
We've been hanging all day.
Shut up!
Hmm.
What the Count needs is a bit of professional help.
What he needs is a top-class racing engineer and spare parts supplier.
Well, I still believe, sir, that what we need... is a top-class racing engineer and spare parts supplier.
I'm quite capable of getting this thing into the record books.
If you can ever get it out of the courtyard.
Yes, if I can ever get...
Igor, that's enough.
- Oh, yes, milord.
- Ahem.
Now, my latest modification is foolproof.
Ha ha ha.
Once that giant three-ton flywheel is spinning... it will give me enough power to go right through the sound barrier.
All we need is a primeval, monstrous... irresistible source of energy, so...
- Nanny!
- Nanny!
Coming, Master Duckula!
OK, Nanny, time to go.
Come back, Nanny, come back.
I just want you to turn that handle as fast as you can, right?
Oh, yes, Master Duckula.
Right.
Now, listen... then when it's doing fourteen thousand revs a minute...
I am going to let in the clutch.
Don't say it, Nanny, don't say it.
And this machine will be through that sound barrier... before you can say Jack Robinson.
Or in your case, Nanny, before you can say Jack.
Righty-o, Duckypoos.
I keeps it tucked inside me sock.
What are you talking about?
I thought you wanted the jack.
No, Nanny, you see, what I meant...
All I was...
Forget it, forget it, forget it.
Just wind the handle.
Ooh, very good, Master Duckula.
Right!
Fourteen thousand revolutions!
This is it!
Fame and fortune, here I come!
You know, Igor, what I think we need... is a top-class racing engineer and a spare parts supplier.
Good afternoon, your Duckness.
My name is Alfonso Ruffles... a top-class racing engineer and spare parts supplier to the nobility.
Hmm.
An engine, an engine!
Wowie-wow!
This is a real breakthrough, Mr. Ruffles.
Oh, call me Alf, your countship.
Oh well that's very nice of you, Alf, your countship.
And you can call me milord.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, where... where did you get it?
Ah.
L...
I'd rather not reveal my sources, your Duckship.
Suffice it to say that you will not find an engine like this... at Indianapolis or on the great racing circuits of Europe.
Good as that, Alf, eh?
Good, milord, isn't the word for it.
OK, well, let's get it going.
Let's see what it can do.
Ahem.
Well, there is the little matter of payment, your countliness.
My what?
Oh, sorry.
Matter of what?
Payment.
I'd be happier if I could have the money before you find out...
Uh, before you try out the engine.
Ah, ha ha!
No use.
His lordship can't hear when he has his helmet on.
I wants the money for the engine!
And I can't hear when people talk about money.
Here we go!
Here we go!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
All right, my little Duckypoos!
Nanny will save you!
Of course I won't hit you... not if you tell me where you got that blooming engine.
Oh, yeah, all right.
I pinched it out of a cement mixer.
A cement...
You stupid great nana!
Oh!
Ouch!
Ooh!
Good job, Nanny.
Where did you get all that elastic?
- Um...
- Never mind, Nanny, never mind.
Yes, Igor, you'd have to be a complete idiot... not to see how this works.
Excuse me, Duckypoos...
Yes, Nanny?
You want to know how this works?
It's really very simple.
This powerful elastic band has been stretched to its limit.
It's not the only one.
Exactly, Igor.
And located in a hook at the front of the car... it is held in place by two strong ropes... which are attached to a cross bar.
The cross bar is held by a clamp.
When the red handle is pulled back, the bar is released... and the elastic propels the car forward at 750 miles an hour... thus bringing the world land speed record to Transylvania... and fame and fortune to me.
Is that quite clear?
Quite clear, milord.
- Nanny?
- Yes?
- Any questions?
- Yes.
How does this work?
OK, Nanny, OK.
Just one more time.
Now, you use a powerful elastic band, so you hold it in front of the car.
Pull red handle, cross bar release, record, rich and famous, hooray, got it?
Pull the red handle?
Hmm?
Yes, Nanny, yes.
Pull the red 'andle... handle.
No!
No, Nanny!
No, Nanny!
Don't pull the red...
Oh, no, Nanny!
You half-witted peanut brain, concrete skull, witless washout!
Look what you've done!
Do you understand what you have done?
Oh, yes.
Now I sees how it works.
You've ruined my chances forever.
I'll never see my lovely car again.
Oh, I don't know, sir.
What do you mean, you don't know?
It seems, milord, to have gone into reverse.
Don't be ridic...
Reverse?
Oh, no!
Aah!
Ooh, he'll do himself no good rushing about like that.
Now where's he gone off to, I'd like to know.
Oh, don't worry, Nanny.
He'll be back.
Well, Nanny, I suggest we go and have a spot of afternoon tea... while we wait for equilibrium to set in.
Yes, I had a bit of that equilibrium... but it's been a lot better since I rubbed it with camphorated oil.
Yes, that's what I said... nick 'em.
Uh, what?
- Like, now?
- Now!
And when you've done that, bring 'em back to the base.
- And you...
- Yes, guv?
You pinch all the cans of paint you can lay your hands on, and a brush.
- Lots of brushes.
- Yes, guv.
Now, get on with it.
But I promise you, my friend... that mein invention will propel you through the sound barrier... und into the record books without no trouble... so help me if it don't.
Now, listen, I've had enough of high speed travel... and I'm sick of people calling me Count Boomerang.
I promise you, my old cocker spaniel... that with my invention no blooming harm can come to you.
Not half.
Und you will be famous forever for only 200,000 drachmas.
- Uh, the Count hasn't got it...
- Yes, thank you, Igor.
If you will come this way, we will prepare for the ripoff...
Uh, take off, start.
Ooh, high performance.
Ooh, ooh!
Wow-wow!
All you have to do, mate...
Uh, mein herr, is to keep your eye on the speedometer.
You won't feel a thing.
Wow!
This is great, Dr Einstein.
OK, ready when you are.
First, put on the earphones, so to you I can talk.
I beg your pardon?
First, put on the earphones, so to you I can talk.
Ah, yes.
Now I've got the earphones on...
I can hear that you can talk.
Are you receiving me?
Over.
Loud and clear, professor.
OK, then let her go.
Whee!
Wow, look at that!
Two hundred miles an hour, and I can't feel a thing!
Faster, Count, faster!
OK, 250, 300, 350.
Whee hee hee!
You're doing fine!
Keep going!
Don't forget the 200,000 drachmas!
Five hundred miles an hour!
Five hundred and fifty!
Six hundred!
Wow!
At this rate, I'll be going through the sound barrier any minute.
- Blimey, nearly forgot the barrier.
- What did you say, Dr. Einstein?
Blimey, I nearly forgot the sound barrier.
675 miles an hour, and it's really smooth in here.
Seven hundred!
Seven hundred and twenty-five!
Any second now, and I'll be through the sound barrier.
Here, what's happening?
Something's going wrong.
Seven hundred and thirty!
Seven hundred and thirty-five!
Seven hundred and forty!
Ha ha ha!
Seven hundred and forty-five!
Nearly there!
This is fantastic!
Seven hundred and fifty miles an hour, and...
I did it!
I broke the sound barrier!
The world record is mine!
- I am...
I...
- Help!
What?
What the...
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
Good evening, milord.
It looks like being a delightfully sinister and foggy night... with never a clove of garlic in sight.
Would you like me to bring you a glass of RH negative?
No, Igor, I would not.
Anything in the Transylvanian Times?
Mmm, just one interesting story, milord.
Mmm?
What's that?
It seems that two gentlemen, flying hand-operated fairground carousels... have established a new world record for man-powered flight.
Oh, well, I have only one thing to say to that.
And what is that, milord?
Ah, ha ha ha!
And so once more, the poor simple peasant folk... huddle round their poor simple television sets... and tremble with fear at the horror that is to come.
Next week perchance.
Ho ho!
So, for now, good night out there... whatever you are.
If you're feeling...
Or you're kind of...
Could be you've met up with
Duckula
If your knees go...
And your teeth go...
Maybe you've bumped into
Duckula
He flies through the night
Looking for a bite
But he's back home by daylight
Duckula
If you're sort of...
Or you're a little...
It's certain you've run into
Duckula
If your heart goes...
Or your mind goes...
Man, you had a brush with
Duckula
So watch out for the...
Beware of the...
And pray you'll never meet with
Duckula
Count Duckula
"There was a table set out under a tree...
"in the front of the house...
"and the March Hare and the Hatter...
"were having tea at it.
"A dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep...
"and the other two were using it as a cushion...
"resting their elbows on it and talking over its head."
George, don't do that.
"Very uncomfortable for the dormouse, thought Alice."
"'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter."
You skipped something, didn't you?
It never occurred to me that anyone was listening.
You're being paid to read to us.
Not to skip.
"'You should learn not to make personal remarks'...
"Alice said with some severity.
'lt's very rude."'
George, please don't do that.
Why is Lucifer making that noise?
He's practicing for school.
Tell me after you've swallowed.
He's practicing for his school band.
Anyway, his name is Luther.
- Is he the drummer?
- He's trying out.
He tried out last year and the year before that... but they said he wasn't ready yet.
Does seem fiendishly complicated, doesn't it?
- George.
- My name's not George.
What is it then?
For me to know, and you to find out.
Whatever it is, please don't stand on my foot.
- That hurt.
- Good.
"'Have you guessed the riddle yet?
'
"the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.
"'No, I give it up,' Alice replied.
'What's the answer?"'
You're skipping again.
I beg your pardon?
You're skipping again.
I'll report you to Mama... and see that she cuts your fee in half... because you're only reading half the book.
I'll sic our dog on you when you leave.
He hates people on bicycles.
You're a hateful, ugly, horrible man... and you shouldn't be allowed.
You're quite right.
I shouldn't be allowed.
Nadia, he kicked me!
Mama, Mama!
He hurt Nadia!
He's electric!
What's going on here?
May I suggest that you encourage your children... to play with matches.
Mama, he kicked Joseph.
He wasn't even reading the book right.
He's not doing his job.
He shocked me!
He shocked you?
Yes?
Good morning.
I'm Theophilus North.
Mrs. Baily-Lewis is expecting me.
In general, sir, this door is not used in the morning.
You'll find the garden door around the corner of the house.
Please tell Mrs. Baily-Lewis I'm here.
Our appointment was for 10:00.
It's exactly that hour now.
I repeat, sir, this door is not used at this hour.
Kindly take your bicycle around...
Did you hear what I said?
There we go.
Could you take those?
Thank you so much.
Are you deaf or insane or both?
I distinctly told you to go around to the garden door.
Get back to work!
All of you!
At once!
Jenkins, there's silver to polish.
Margaret, tend to the flowers.
Sally, will you stop giggling?
Get out of here.
Take your rubbish...
Who is this person, Willis?
Theophilus North, madame.
I am Sarah Baily-Lewis.
It's all right, Willis.
I was expecting Mr. North.
Thank you, madame.
This does not concern you, Persis Bosworth Tennyson.
This does not concern any of you.
You, too, Dora.
Get back to your chores.
Yes, ma'am.
But it's not Dora.
It's Sarah, same as you.
Sarah.
Same as me.
You impudent child.
You are not the same as me, and don't you ever forget it.
Try to rise above your station in this house, missy... and you'll find yourself back on the ould sod... emptying chamberpots and doing twice the amount of work... for a quarter of what you get paid here.
This way, Mr. North.
Take a seat, please, Mr. North.
Thank you, but I prefer to stand.
Just as you wish.
Good morning, Sarah.
You take the high road and I'll take the low
You take the high road and I'll take...
Good morning, Dr. McPherson.
How's my father today?
As well as can be expected, Sarah.
I hope he's not losing any ground.
No, no.
He's holding his own.
We're holding his own, Angus.
Oh, yes, of course.
My medicine and your tender loving care.
You'll look in tomorrow?
Yes, of course, Sarah.
Good morning.
Good morning, Dr. McPherson.
- Mr. North?
- Yes, ma'am.
As I told you on the telephone, I wish you to read to my father.
Yes, ma'am.
My father is 71 years old.
He needs the solace of hearing the good book.
He is a very sick man, Mr. North.
I see.
Your advertisement said you charge $2.00 an hour.
That's correct.
How long would it take?
- King James Version?
- Of course.
Let's see.
It's about 1,200 pages.
I'd say 80 hours.
- That would be $160.
- Yes, ma'am.
It's an exorbitant price, Mr. North.
Perhaps you could find a more reasonable figure.
Let's see.
I could read the Old Testament in Hebrew.
Think of it.
Your father would be hearing God's words as he dictated them to Moses and the prophets.
My father doesn't understand a word of Hebrew.
The point is there are no vowels in Hebrew.
It would reduce my reading time by as much as seven hours.
Mr. North...
Not good enough?
Let me add another incentive.
With your agreement, I'll throw in the New Testament in Greek.
Throw in?
Yes, it would reduce my price by another $20.
Mr. North, you're being absurd.
Not at all, madame.
You gave me to understand... that your interest was in speed, not intelligibility.
In which case, I'll tell you what else I can do.
I'll read the Sermon on the Mount... in 4 minutes and 51 seconds.
If I go one second over that mark...
I will knock another $5.00 off this already rock-bottom price.
This is blasphemy, Mr. North.
I think you'd better leave this house at once.
Shall we say an even $130?
No questions asked.
Mr. North, you'd better go!
Kindly leave this house at once, Mr. North!
Sarah, send that young man in here now.
Yes, Father.
Good morning.
Come in.
Come in.
I'm James McHenry Bosworth.
Theophilus North, sir.
Sarah wants to save my soul.
She thinks I'm an infidel because I won't go to church... and listen to some nincompoop flannel on... about what's sinful and what isn't.
The fact is, she's waiting... hoping I'll kick the bucket so that she can inherit.
But reading the Bible to me at cut rates... tells the whole story.
All this is strictly confidential, of course.
- Of course.
- Please.
You don't look like a man... who's read the Bible in the original Hebrew.
I haven't.
- You lied.
- Admittedly.
But I can read you Plotinus in Latin...
Descartes in French, Schopenhauer in German.
- But no Hebrew.
- No.
- Greek?
- No.
Just as well.
I wouldn't understand you anyway.
Who are you, Theophilus North?
What do you mean, sir?
Where do you come from?
I grew up in the Midwest, sir.
My father owns a newspaper in Madison, Wisconsin.
- A Yale man?
- Yes.
I'm Harvard, class of '76, myself.
Go on.
After college, I spent four and a half uneventful years... teaching at a boys' school.
The sameness of it all, the safety... began to feel like a prison, so I left.
Now you want to experience life.
I want to be a free man.
But why Newport?
Why not Paris?
Tibet?
Kismet, sir.
The hand of fate.
What are your plans?
To find employment, sir, if I can.
No, I mean for the future.
I have a number of ambitions, sir.
What are they, besides being a free man?
I thought I'd like to be a detective.
Oh?
And an actor.
And a rascal.
In the sense of the Spanish word "picaro," sir.
A man who lives by his wits.
Light of foot, purse, and baggage.
- An adventurer.
- Exactly.
I notice you haven't mentioned doctor, lawyer, or banker.
No, sir.
Though once I did resolve to be a saint.
- Indeed?
- It was when I was 12.
I saw myself as a missionary among the heathens.
The idea was to live an exemplary life... perhaps even rise to the crown of martyrdom.
We're all shaped by the promises of our imagination.
You're not the first... whose future was foretold in childish dreams.
Such matters aside, do I have a job, Mr. Bosworth?
- You want it?
- Yes.
Two hours a day, three days a week.
Shake on it?
What was that?
It's nothing, sir.
What?
Well, sir, it's my body.
I have an extraordinary capacity... for building up electrical charges.
Sometimes when I touch people, I shock them.
Metaphorically speaking, of course.
Oh, no, sir.
I'm a walking Tesla coil.
Most unusual.
How do you stand on Berkeley?
Bishop George Berkeley?
Anglo-lrish philosopher, 1685-1753?
I have a particular affinity for him, sir.
A most unusual young man.
It's all yours.
There you go.
Thanks, Cully.
How about my standing you to a jar?
That would be great.
Mr. Mulligan, might we talk you out of a real beer?
The occasion calls for it, Prohibition notwithstanding.
- Right, Cully?
- Right.
Well...
New in town, Cully?
Just got here a couple of days ago.
Anything special bring you this way?
No.
Just happenstance.
You one of them gigolos?
What?
One of them dancing partners with ambitions.
Or maybe one of them yellow journalists... digging around to find out what goes on the big houses.
"Duke's daughter found in opium den.
"Read all about it."
Do you have a copy of this week's paper?
I don't know if this will relieve your worries... or exacerbate them, but...
Here it is.
"T. Theophilus North.
Yale, 1920..."
A college boy.
Quiet, gentlemen, please.
"Master at Raritan School in New Jersey, 1920-1926."
"Tutoring for school and college examinations...
"in English, French, German, Latin, and Algebra."
French, German, Algebra?
Well, Cully...
I mean, Mr. T. Theophilus North... perhaps we owe you an apology.
A number of types come to Newport... suspicious types we don't like to see too much of.
Henry Simmons here.
Hello, Henry.
Cheers.
Cheers.
I'm from London, meself.
Never went to school after I was 12.
Got work as a bootblack... swept the barbershop for tuppence extra.
Moved up to domestic service.
A gentleman's gentleman I am now.
He's head man at the Venable cottage.
Plus he's senior man at Amelia Cranston's... boarding establishment, where all the best help live.
You can't get no higher than that, Cully... senior man at Amelia Cranston's.
One, two, three, four.
Follow me now, and here we go.
One, two, three, four.
Everybody backwards.
And forward now.
Here we go.
Everybody roll.
And up we get, and down the court we go.
Make a left here, and line up on the line.
One, two, three, four.
And... to a halt.
Very good.
Today, we'll learn how to play at the net.
If it rains, can you tell me a story instead?
Yes. "The Necklace," by De Maup...
De Maupassant, Eloise.
No, there's not a cloud in the sky.
Nice try there, Johnny.
Then please, afterwards a story.
- Yeah.
- Please.
- Tell us a story?
- Please?
Well, we'll see.
If you're very good, maybe.
Now we have to learn the blocking shot.
You're at the net... right foot forward, left foot back.
Right arm in a forehand grip.
Elbow bent.
You can use your left arm for balance.
OK?
That's good.
Bend your knees.
Keep your weight on your toes.
- Very good, Johnny.
- Thanks.
- This right?
- Not quite, Ada.
Let's try it again.
This time, Ada, you be the model.
All right, put your right foot forward.
This one?
Hold your racquet out in front.
Bend your elbow, bend your knee.
That's good.
Move your hand here.
You gave me a shock.
I'm sorry.
He has electric hands.
- Really?
- Honest.
Can I have a shock, too, Mr. North, please?
You really want one?
- Yes.
Please?
- OK.
Can I have a shock, Mr. North, please?
Please?
Me, Mr. North, please.
- Holy moley!
- Can I have a turn?
Wait a minute.
One at a time.
- Do it to me.
- I want a shock.
- Touch me.
- That is magic.
- Help!
- Do me!
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Henry.
Best chowder in the world, Mino.
Thank you, Henry.
Hey, Cully.
Is that you?
Hello, Henry.
What are you doing here?
I'm working here.
I thought you were a college boy.
I'm a broke college boy, Henry.
My night at the billiard parlor left me busted.
You should have let on.
Here.
Oh, no, thanks, Henry.
Really.
- Take it.
- No, Henry.
As long as I work here, I can eat here, right?
Right.
Son of a bitch eats like six fishermen.
Thanks anyway, Henry.
You sure, Cully?
Yes, Henry, really.
Tomorrow I'm due to get paid from a couple of places.
The rich don't necessarily pay prompt.
I know, Henry, but I'll be all right.
Do you mind if I tell you a thing or two about Newport?
Here, sit down.
Mino don't mind.
All right.
Now look, I just paid Rosa there ten cents... for a bowl of the best fish chowder I ever had.
Up there on Bellevue Avenue, they call it bouillabaisse... and get five bucks for it.
It's like that here.
Dress things up a bit, that crowd don't mind the cost.
Roast beef and mash, right?
Simplest stuff in the world, but fancy it up a bit... and you got something special.
Learn to play the game.
You'll be the toast of the town.
Can you keep a secret, Cully?
Promise not to tell a soul?
Cross your heart?
I was born in Chicago, not London.
I was a bootblack all right, but I was shining shoes... on Michigan Avenue when I was 12.
Not Piccadilly.
Picked up the limey talk as a colonel's aide... with the Rainbow Division over fighting the Kaiser.
Had a plan.
Went to France... learned a little Francais in Paris... studied all the menus on the Champs-Elysees... wines...
"Chateau Lafitte, monsieur?"
Uppin' my ante in the job market is what I was doin'.
They eat it up out there on Bellevue Avenue... just like they eat up escargots.
Nobody can sell snails, but call it escargots... and you got the hottest treat in town.
Same with butlers.
They pay three times the price for me if I'm English.
An English butler has more "je ne sais quoi"... than an American.
You want to eat today, kid?
Sure do, Mino.
- Wash.
- Yes, sir.
Use your assets.
Yes.
Thank you, Henry.
You made my day.
Let me make your evening, too.
Come up to Amelia Cranston's tonight when you finish.
There's a few up there who'd like to meet you.
All right.
Thanks.
So you're the one... that gave those wretched Denby children what for.
Bravo, Mr. North, bravo.
The applause is well deserved.
Thank you, madame... but I don't know how everybody knows.
Bush telegraph, Cully.
There isn't much we servants miss, Mr. North.
- Here we are.
- Thank you.
Carefully, Cully.
It's not weak.
And it isn't peppermint.
It certainly isn't tea.
Tell me, Mr. North.
Are you enjoying Newport?
Damnable place.
No lady here's ever heard the beginning of a concert... nor read the end of a book.
Mr. Danforth.
Have you met Mr. Danforth, Mr. North?
No, I haven't.
He served as butler to the Oelrich family... both here and in Baltimore.
He came to us when he retired.
His memory's failing a bit... but he's still called upon from time to time... to grace a sideboard or an entrance hall.
There do seem to be quite a few members... of his generation here in Newport.
Oh, my, yes, Cully.
A great many old gents.
A great many.
May I speak further, ma'am?
You will interrupt me if I get to sliding on the ice?
You may be certain of it, Mr. Simmons.
We got something here we call the death watch... and it's going on in a dozen houses.
Twenty houses, Mr. Simmons.
At least twenty.
Thank you, ma'am.
In at least 20 houses... there's an aged party, male or female... that's sitting on a pile of money... but this aged party refuses to die.
You see, Cully?
So, supposing you're a son or a daughter... even a nevvie or niece...
what do you do?
Particularly if the aged party shows signs of folly.
Like playing favorites, one child over the other.
Or falling in love with his nurse.
Or her chauffeur.
Or the gay divorcee who pulls his beard... and strokes his hand right at the dinner table.
We've seen it happen scores of times... and the death watch goes frantic.
So they call in old Dr. Fred and Needles... and convince the aged party he's got a terrible problem... with his old sofa cushion.
Doctors are the best friends of the death watch.
Right.
So the aged party is wheeled in...
Fred and Needles takes a bit of stuffing... out of said same old sofa cushion... and the death watch persuades him it's time to turn over... checkbook, pen, and signing power.
For this, the doctor gets 10,000.
It's gone up this season, ma'am.
Dr. McPherson's on retainer at the Bosworth cottage for 15.
Now, Mr. Simmons, you're sliding on the ice a bit.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Our gracious lady don't believe in naming names.
I do beg pardon, ma'am.
With all this talk of Newport, ma'am...
I haven't heard much about you.
There really isn't very much to tell.
I spent half a century in the great houses... both here and abroad, as have most of my guests.
But now I'm a boarding house keeper and proud of it.
It's a wonderful place.
Ma'am?
Yes, Mr. North?
Might there be a place for me here?
A room where I could live?
We're all servants here, Cully.
Them what lives off the estates... them what's retired.
I don't make exceptions, Mr. North.
Nonetheless, should you ever find yourself... in a complicated situation... please do feel free to call on me.
Will you remember that?
Yes, indeed.
Thank you, ma'am, for letting me know.
Perhaps you'd like another weak peppermint tea?
At least not from that text, please.
You don't like the story about the grasshopper and the ant?
I prefer stories with happy endings.
Miss?
Perhaps we should end the lesson early today.
- No.
- Elspeth!
- Hello.
May I join?
- Of course.
You've met my brother Galloper.
Yes, on the tennis courts.
Hello, Galloper.
He's called that because he never walks when he can run.
My real name's George Harkness Skeel IV.
- Which do you prefer?
- Galloper.
All right, Galloper.
Your sister and I were just discussing... the fables by Jean De La Fontaine.
- We love animal stories.
- And animals.
Our Aunt Benedickta has a camp at the Adra...
Adirondacks.
We've seen deer there, and foxes, even big bears.
And there are no fences.
They're free.
- Mr. North?
- Yes?
Have you ever had a nightmare about being in prison?
Yes, I have.
It's the worst dream one can have.
- Want to sit down?
- Yes.
Next year my father wants me to do... what they call "coming out in society."
It'll be more of a going in than coming out.
There'll be three dances every night... and tea dances, and being stared at... by a wall of young men all the time.
Don't you think it sounds like being an animal in a zoo?
Every time I think about it, my head begins to ache.
Don't you have something to think about... that would drive away these nightmares?
We always think about animals and talk about them.
Yesterday we had a long talk about... why nature placed birds' eyes on the sides of their heads.
We love to think about the whys of things.
Like your magical hands.
Galloper told me...
Galloper Skeel!
Magical hands, indeed.
But, Mr. North, Elspeth has such awful headaches.
I'm afraid we haven't been quite honest with you.
Galloper persuaded Mother to invite you... so that I could meet you.
And we thought if you put your hands... on Elspeth's head, that maybe you could...
Galloper, Elspeth... there's nothing magical about my hands at all.
I have one of those bodies that collects electricity.
I store up an electrical charge.
The next time I touch something or someone... there's a spark, that's all.
There's nothing magical about it.
Won't you try anyway?
It would be silly, pointless.
Mr. North... please?
As you wish.
Did that help?
Here he is, miss.
Sarah Boffin, sir, from Nine Gables.
Yes, Sarah.
What is it?
I've come to warn you.
You mustn't come near the place.
Please sit down, Sarah.
Why on earth not, Sarah?
Me friends call me Sally.
Sally it is.
A storm's gathering about your head.
I enjoy flashes of lightning.
This isn't just lightning.
It's Mrs. Sarah Baily-Lewis.
She's hired a bouncer to put you off the place.
He'll beat the daylights out of you if you resist.
Does Mr. Bosworth know this?
The dear old soul.
He doesn't know half of what his daughter does.
How did you find out?
I heard Mrs. Baily-Lewis talking to old pinch-bottom Willis.
I'd better hop it back before he notices I'm gone.
All right, Sally.
Thank you very much for coming.
I appreciate the warning.
Good night.
Good night.
Good morning.
I'm Theophilus North.
I don't believe we've met.
They don't want you here anymore, sonny.
I'll go pay my respects to Mr. Bosworth.
Good morning.
Mr. North!
You needn't have worried, Sally.
I was trained in the oriental arts of self-defense.
See, what I did was use something... an order of Nipponese monks came up with... to protect themselves against bandits.
They forbade themselves to use weapons... so they came up with that instead.
It's called jujitsu.
Come in.
Good morning, Mr. Bosworth.
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
No, no, Theophilus.
You're quite on time.
I'm looking forward to the passage we're to read today.
You do know that Bishop Berkeley lived right here... for a time in Newport?
No, I didn't, sir.
He was here three years, converting the Indians... and trying to raise money for a university in Bermuda.
He built a place, Whitehall.
You must see it.
Yes, sir.
The Budlongs have done a wonderful job of restoration.
Berkeley's desk is there, some of his manuscripts.
How I wish that I could show it to you.
It'd be a great privilege to see Whitehall in your company.
I suffer from a very embarrassing weakness.
It's my bladder.
Dr. McPherson hasn't been able to do anything about it.
It's made me a prisoner in this house for eight years.
I'm afraid you'll have to see Whitehall on your own.
You have my sympathy, sir.
Let's get on with the reading.
"Essay Concerning Human Understanding.
"Chapter One.
"An idea, which considered in itself is particular...
"becomes general by being made to represent...
"or stand for all other ideas of the same sort."
Shall I go on, sir?
I've lived a very adventurous life.
My daughter, Mrs. Baily-Lewis, tells me... that I should be grateful and not greedy for more... but I do long to breathe the sweet air of freedom.
I'm sure you understand that.
It was one of your ambitions to be a free man.
Yes, it is, sir.
- North?
- Yes, good morning.
How dare you take liberties with my daughter?
It's an outrage!
Take liberties?
What do you mean?
You laid hands on my Elspeth.
You touched my daughter!
I only touched her forehead.
I don't care where you touched her!
I don't mean that.
You know damn well what I mean!
George, please!
If you ever dare to set foot on this property again... or ever dare make contact whatsoever with Elspeth...
I shall call the police.
Good day to you, sir.
Sweetheart!
Good day to you, too, sir.
We've missed you lately, Mr. North.
I'm flattered, ma'am, but I have so many students now.
Some days my schedule's so full, I just fall into bed at 10:00.
- It's going well, then.
- Yes, ma'am.
I've even turned down a job or two.
Think of it.
We're not even in high season.
The sweet smell of high season.
It always brings down fortune hunters, Cully... flocks of them, like fireflies on a summer night.
Dancing pumps in hand, oily smiles on their faces.
All of them wafting around in search of... some sweet little thing in copper mines or railroads.
You'll be seeing a lot of them, Cully.
What do you mean?
You're reading in a house... that's home to one of Newport's fairest flowers.
- Persis Tennyson?
- No names, Cully.
House rules... no names.
The girl's a treasure, Cully.
As beautiful as the dawn, as gracious as the queen.
And as rich as the plummiest pudding at Christmas.
So young to be a widow.
She's a widow?
There's not a fortune hunter in town... fails to call around at her place.
She turns them away, of course.
They say now her heart's as cold as the Arctic.
Nonsense.
She just has a perfect ear for insincerity.
She might listen to you, Cully.
How about it?
- Not me, Henry.
- Why ever not?
As far as I can tell, the partner with the money... holds the whip hand in this town.
I don't want to be that kind of a husband.
Besides, I don't even own dancing pumps.
Shall we?
You have a visitor, sir.
What an unexpected pleasure.
Come in.
Sit down.
What brings you out this way today?
I brought something for you, sir.
Something to help you with your problem.
Indeed?
Grandfather had the same problem as you... so I wrote to him.
These are from his own supply.
You don't say.
They're an ancient remedy, sir.
Not much used these days, but Grandfather swears by them.
You're very generous.
Thank you, Theophilus.
I also brought you these, sir.
What on God's earth are these?
Tea, Grandfather?
You've met my granddaughter, haven't you?
No, sir.
In that case, Persis Bosworth Tennyson... may I present T. Theophilus North?
Mr. North.
I'm deeply honored, Mrs. Tennyson.
Now, Theophilus, what did you say these are?
Well, sir... they're rubber pants, sir.
I thought those were for babies.
They were invented for babies, sir... but they also make them bigger for hospitals and...
Insane asylums you were going to say.
Well, sir, I wouldn't...
I'll leave you two alone now, Grandfather.
There are some diapers, sir, to use as liners.
Good God.
Just a safeguard, sir.
I'm sure the pills will work.
You'll be able to throw those away very soon.
The thing is, all together, they'll do the trick.
Let you go where you want to go, do what you want to do.
Thank you, Theophilus.
I'm very grateful.
- Hi, Arnold.
- Hey, Mr. North.
Having a good time, Mr. North?
- Happy Independence Day.
- See you.
Thanks, Zachary, you little twerp.
- Nice pony.
- Thank you.
Sally.
Sally Boffin.
Well, hello.
Please allow me to treat.
One for me as well.
- What flavor, sir?
- Chocolate.
Thank you.
Here's to the saint of Nine Gables.
I don't know what that means, but it sounds complimentary.
It is.
It's a rare person that can get... under the skin of Mrs. Baily-Lewis.
- Truly?
- She's been in a tizzy for days.
- Over me?
- Over Mr. Bosworth.
Seems you're putting ideas into his head.
Only those of Bishop Berkeley.
I suppose it doesn't matter what the cause.
He's been going out for drives every day with Persis.
I mean, Mrs. Tennyson.
Gives old lady Baily-Lewis the fits.
Says the old gent's going to kill himself with the exertion.
I should think she'd be glad Mr. Bosworth's feeling better.
Go on with you.
Next thing she knows... he'll be wanting to spend his money his way.
I see.
The old gent's pitched that old sawbones.
- Dr. McPherson?
- Banished.
This truly is Independence Day.
It is.
It is.
Will you be staying for the fireworks, Sally?
I was thinking of it.
Shall we see them together?
Would that be good?
I'd like it very much.
Then it would be my great honor, Mr. North.
Theophilus, please.
It's a wonderful holiday, your Fourth of July.
They don't have it in Ireland.
Look there.
It's grand, isn't it?
Sally, you can see much better if you lie down.
There's nothing like it, is there?
No.
There's nothing like it.
Oh, look.
Look.
Sweet Sally.
Mr. North.
Theophilus.
Theophilus, please.
No more.
Stop.
But, Sally, you're so sweet.
Oh, Patrick.
Patrick?
Who's Patrick?
Oh, Theophilus, I'm ever so sorry.
Who's Patrick?
Michael Patrick Ennis III.
Of the Ennises of Boston?
Yes.
And the man I love.
I'm sorry, Theophilus.
His mother brought me to this country to work for her.
I was a good girl till then.
I swear it.
Is he a cad, this Patrick?
Oh, no.
No.
He's a true gentleman.
He wants to marry me.
It's his mother that won't have it.
She threatened to cut poor Paddy off... from everything his father left him... and I knew she meant it.
So...
I lit out of there.
Landed at Nine Gables.
But I miss him so.
Does he know where you are?
No.
No, and he never will.
Why?
Because look at me.
I'm a maid... just like my mother and her mother before her... cleaning up after other people.
Michael Patrick Ennis III... needs a lady... just as he's a gentleman.
Sally, shame on you.
Do you know anything about his grandfather...
Michael Patrick Ennis the First?
No.
When he first landed in this country... he was nothing but an ordinary hod carrier... lugging mortar and bricks.
It's true.
The name Ennis means money and power today... but what did it mean originally?
Somebody from the town of Ennis in Ireland.
That's all.
Now, my advice to you, young lady... is to start thinking of yourself as somebody... somebody special and wonderful... because you are, you know.
And if Michael Patrick Ennis III doesn't share that opinion... then to hell with him.
But he does.
That's part of the problem.
He thinks I'm better than I am.
You're good enough for anybody just as you are.
Now go back to Boston... and tell Michael Patrick Ennis III that I said so.
Well, I just might.
You're a wonderful girl, Sally.
You're not so bad yourself.
This way, sir.
North.
What's happened to Elspeth?
Another attack of the migraine, the worst ever.
- Where is she?
- This way.
North... it's very good of you to come... particularly in light of our last meeting.
Madame, you're putting your daughter in the gravest danger.
Mr. North, thank heaven you're here.
Skeel, it's either him or me.
If you intend to let this man even see your daughter...
I withdraw from the case.
Dr. McPherson, your car is waiting.
The poor girl, Mr. North, she's blind with pain.
Dr. McPherson tried everything, but nothing has helped.
Elspeth believes that only you can help her.
Please, North, do... whatever you can.
Elspeth, dear.
Mr. North has come to see you.
I knew you'd come.
Your mother tells me you're in a great deal of pain.
Yes... but it's not what they think.
I know it's not.
Dr. McPherson thinks she may have a brain tumor.
He wants to send her to Boston for an operation.
I won't go.
I won't.
No, no, no.
It's OK.
Please help me.
Please help me, Mr. North.
I know you can.
Of course.
There you go.
First afternoon, half an hour.
Second afternoon, 45 minutes.
I'm free, Theophilus.
Free.
That's fine, sir.
I'm very happy for you.
Fine?
Fine?
I've been a prisoner in my own house for eight years.
To get out like this, it's... it's far more than fine.
I've decided to buy Whitehall and its surrounding 50 acres.
I plan to build an academy of philosophy... sort of an Athens by the sea.
I shall invite the great philosophers... from all over the world.
To come and lecture here, sir?
To come and live here, each in his own house.
I'd have to build them, of course.
To lecture or not, as they please.
To teach or not, as they please.
Newport will be like a lighthouse on a high hill...
A Pharos of the mind... a safe harbor for higher intellectual thoughts.
There is so much to be done.
Mr. North?
You have visitors, Mr. North.
A lot of them.
Really?
That's him!
That's Theophilus North.
Hello, Mr. North.
I suffer from rheumatism something terrible.
Mr. North, I know you cured Elspeth Skeel.
I know you can cure me.
I'm losing my hair.
Help me.
Please.
Ladies, gentlemen, I'm not a doctor.
I don't know the first thing about what ails you.
You'll have to consult your own doctor.
I'd rather pay you than some old sawbones.
I don't want your money.
Please.
This is the Young Men's Christian Association.
It is not a tent meeting.
I know.
He's right.
You have to leave.
It's true.
It's true!
I felt it like lightning.
I'm cured!
No.
I haven't been able to move these fingers in years!
Hallelujah!
You cannot hold your unholy devotions in here.
Get these people out of here!
All right.
It's growing again.
I can feel it.
Feel it.
It's growing again.
My rheumatism is gone!
My ear, Mr. North.
There you are.
My headache.
Your headache?
It's gone?
Fine.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's the last time.
You can't come back.
You'll have to see your own doctors.
Have a good day.
Bye.
Sorry.
I want to swear out a warrant... for the arrest of Theophilus North.
What's the charge?
Practicing medicine without a license.
Name?
Dr. Angus...
McPherson.
Tante Liselotte, you have a visitor.
A visitor?
Me?
It's a mistake.
It's not a mistake, fraulein.
I wanted very much to meet you.
This is Mr. North.
Mr...
North.
You remember.
I remember.
The one with the hands.
I'm not a doctor, you know.
I'm here as a friend of Mrs. Cranston's.
I understand.
I speak German so badly... but what a wonderful language it is.
Aren't "leiden" and "leibe"... and "sehnsucht" more beautiful words... than "suffering" and "love" and "longing"?
And your name...
Liselotte... for Elizabeth Charlotte.
It's beautiful.
I see you still have all your children around you.
So much love.
"Dearest Nana."
There was much love, but now...
Nothing.
The memories.
No one can take those away from you.
Herr doktor, come close.
I want to die.
Why God doesn't let me die?
Tante Liselotte... did you ever learn the hymn that goes...
Since little girl I know this song.
God's time is the best time.
Did you forget?
I forget.
Thank you to remind me.
Yes?
You better get downstairs right away.
I tried to put them out, but they won't move.
Please, wait.
Mr. North can't see you.
There he is!
This is the YMCA!
Come back!
- Mr. North!
- Please!
- Aw, Henry.
- Christ!
They're after me.
Oh, God!
Run out the back way.
Run to Tarker's wharf.
Wait!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sorry!
Swim, Cully.
Swim for your life!
Get in here now.
Come on, Cully!
Get in!
Get off the boat!
The keel!
Keep in touch!
How does it feel to be... one of the most sought-after celebrities in Newport?
Oh, God, Henry.
What am I going to do?
Are you Mr. T. Theophilus North... resident of the Newport YMCA?
Yes, I am.
We have a warrant here for your arrest.
Please come with me.
What's this about, now?
You'll have to find out at the station, Henry.
A warrant?
Oh, no.
It's all right, Cully.
We'll have you out in no time.
All rise, please.
We'll hear the charges, Dr. McPherson.
Your Honor.
This man, Mr. T. Theophilus North... has been practicing medicine without a license.
Yes, yes, Dr. McPherson.
I've read the warrant you swore out.
Get to the particulars, if you please.
On numerous occasions since his arrival here in Newport...
Mr. North has been interfering with my patients... offering to cure them of ailments... which I, a trained medical man... find incurable.
Never cures anything... when there's a fee to be had for not curing them.
Half the town thinks he's a miracle worker!
- Yes.
- Yes.
Get to the specifics, Doctor, please.
He prescribed pills for James McHenry Bosworth... one of my patients... and one of our most distinguished older citizens.
That's a serious charge, Doctor.
What happened?
He's been running around like a man of 50.
It really won't do.
It could kill him.
North also laid hands on Elspeth Skeel... for her migraine headaches.
They went away, too.
Go on, Doctor.
Please.
Your Honor, I think I can safely speak... for the entire medical profession... when I say we cannot have a situation... where people are curing each other without us.
Thank you.
Serious ailments need serious attention.
Medicine is a science.
What North is doing is quackery and dangerous... because, if allowed to continue... it could cause severe damage.
My office is deserted.
My patients come to me for serious medical attention.
They cannot get that out of miracle workers.
North knows this, and still he persists!
Thank God for that.
Fortunately!
These are serious charges, young man.
How do you answer them?
Your Honor, I can only say that I meant no harm.
Is it true you prescribed pills for Mr. Bosworth?
I gave him a vial of pills, Your Honor.
Pills which enabled me to get out... after spending years as a shut-in.
Peppermint, Your Honor.
Nothing more.
Peppermint.
Mr. Bosworth, would you approach the bench, please?
Do you have your pills with you, sir?
I do.
- May I have them?
- Certainly.
They are peppermint.
And the other charges... that you laid hands on Elspeth Skeel?
Your Honor, the young lady was in a great deal of pain.
Your Honor, whatever Mr. North did... he did at the request of Elspeth's mother and me.
We're so grateful.
We have since had Elspeth examined by a specialist.
The brain tumor that Dr. McPherson diagnosed... does not exist.
Have the headaches recurred?
No, Your Honor.
There's a scientific explanation for this.
This scoundrel's no part of it.
Your Honor, except for my being a scoundrel...
I entirely agree with Dr. McPherson.
My reputation as a healer is undeserved.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
It springs from a peculiar propensity of mine, Your Honor.
Shall I demonstrate?
If you please.
What I do, Your Honor, is give electric shocks.
Not here.
Over there.
It won't hurt.
As you can see, Your Honor... it's just a natural phenomenon.
Something some school children took for magic.
Yes, well, they made a mistake.
You took advantage of it.
Nicholas?
I'm sorry.
I mean, Judge Catwalader.
Masseurs, manipulators, and healers... have always come to Newport.
They have licenses.
And they take money for their services... but everyone knows you can't buy miracles.
That's how Mr. North... came to be thought of as the miracle man.
He takes no fees.
There's no sign that Mr. Bosworth or George Skeel... ever gave him an automobile or a gold watch... or even the smallest bonus.
And yet, look what he did for them.
Order!
Order in the court!
Order!
It would seem the worst that could be said of Mr. North... is that he has engaged in some kindly meddling.
But I demand justice!
Young man, you're free to go.
This is not justice.
I demand a conviction.
You're in contempt, McPherson.
A $50 fine and 3 days in jail.
How do you like that?
I will not tolerate any further disturbance.
Sergeant, remove this man from the courtroom.
Case dismissed.
This court is adjourned.
All rise.
Thank you.
Mind those electric hands of yours in the future.
Yes, sir.
Mr. North, mail.
Thank you.
I've been invited to a dance.
That's nice.
You must go.
It's the ball of the season.
Would you refuse an invitation from the president?
Probably not.
Or from the king and queen of England?
Thank you.
My dear young man, as you well know... the Venables are the "ne plus ultra" of Newport... which is the "ne plus ultra" of everywhere.
Saratoga and Bar Harbor are the provinces... compared to here.
Why would the Venables invite me?
You've become quite the rage since the events of last month.
That is not an invitation.
It's a command, and you are going.
Let's try this.
How's that feel?
It's a little small, don't you think?
A bit small?
I'd say yes.
Small.
Where did you find all these things anyway?
Various gentlemen's gentlemen.
Actually, I canvassed every butler on Bellevue Avenue.
My God.
Amelia Cranston wants you to look your best tonight.
She said it's very important.
Sure.
Sheer perfection, old bean.
Now can you teach me how to dance?
I'm afraid that's not in my repertory.
However, I'm sure we can arrange something.
- Thank you.
- Yes.
Good evening, madame.
Good evening, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Good evening.
Good evening, sir.
- Theophilus.
- Hello, Mrs. Cranston.
Turn around.
Is it all right?
It's wonderful.
Perfect.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Sir James Graham Oelrich and Mrs. Oelrich.
Captain Stuyvesant Belmonte and Miss Wetmore.
Mr. T. Theophilus North.
- You say you're North?
- Yes, sir.
Of course you are.
It's good to see you.
I'm Buster Venable, Amanda's nephew.
Theophilus North!
I'm Amanda Venable... and I've heard so much about you.
I'm honored to be here, ma'am.
I'd like to present you to our guests of honor...
Mr. and Mrs. Michael Patrick Ennis of Boston.
I knew you'd come.
Paddy, this is Theophilus.
North, Sally's told me all about you.
You're the best friend a man could have.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Come with me.
I love you.
We're so happy.
Sally, look at you.
When did all this happen?
I went to Boston right after you and I...
- Decided you should.
- Right.
I didn't give notice.
I just took off.
And you were so right about everything.
Patrick does love me.
And he missed me just as much as I missed him.
So we went straight to his mother... she finally gave us her blessing... and the cardinal himself married us in the family chapel.
His mother's not so fierce, once you get to know her.
She gave this to Patrick for me.
It was the ring her grandfather... gave her grandmother for their wedding.
But didn't she cry when he put it on my finger.
It was happiness, I'm sure.
Mothers can be awfully funny about an only son.
We're so happy, Theophilus, and it's all your doing.
I'm very happy for you.
Now I know why I was invited to this shindig.
I thought you might like the surprise.
Mrs. Sarah Baily-Lewis.
Back I go.
Sarah, may I present our guests of honor...
Mr. and Mrs. Michael Patrick Ennis of Boston?
Of Boston.
I know your mother so well.
Is she still talking about Yeats?
She was always the silver apples...
I'd like you to meet my bride.
Darling?
Hello, Sarah.
It's me, Sarah, too.
You remember.
Ould sod.
Ould sod.
You're not the same as me, and don't you ever forget it.
Try to rise above your station in this house, missy... and you'll find yourself back in the ould sod... emptying chamber pots.
I went out to the hazelwood
Because a fire was in my head
Parched and peeled the hazel one
And hooked a bell to a dress
Herbert, the salts.
Quickly.
North?
Theophilus.
Mr. Bosworth.
I have a proposition for you.
- Sir?
- My academy of philosophy.
Benedetto Croce has accepted.
We have hopes of Bertrand Russell.
Congratulations, Mr. Bosworth.
Thank you, Theophilus.
I want you in on everything.
I'm putting the best part of my fortune into the academy... in a trust that will fund it forever.
You'll be the trustee to scout the earth... for up-and-coming thinkers wherever they may be.
Up-and-coming thinkers?
Philosophers, pundits, sages, thinkers... from all over the world.
You'll be free to travel anywhere you like.
Europe, the Orient, the Steppe of Russia...
Alexandria, the Holy Land, Kyoto, Lhasa... the Peruvian Andes, Chichen Itza, Angkor Wat... wherever knowledge is or ever has been.
I accept, sir.
Good man, Theophilus.
I had hope of this.
May I have the honor of this dance, Mrs. Tennyson?
I'd be delighted.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be... please.
I only hope it will happen often.
Theophilus, you are a most unusual young man.

A WHOLE GENERATION OF AMERICANS HAD GROWN UP
KNOWING NO OTHER PRESIDENT.
HE WAS A PRESENCE IN THEIR LIVING ROOMS,
HE'D CALLED THEM "MY FRIENDS," HE'D BEEN AT THE HELM
THROUGH THE TWO WORST CRISES OF THIS CENTURY.
AND TO HAVE HIM SUDDENLY GONE WAS AN OVERWHELMING SHOCK.
Man:
THE BOSS MAN COME TO THE FIELD, HE THROWED UP HIS HANDS.
HE SAID, "MR. ROOSEVELT DIED TODAY."
I SAID, "WHAT?"
HE SAID, "MR. ROOSEVELT DIED TODAY."
I JUST SAT THERE.
I JUST SAT THERE.
I WAS STUNNED.
I FELT LIKE I HAD LOST
ONE OF THE CLOSEST BROTHERS I EVER HAD.
Man:
IT WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST FEELING OF LOSS...
DISORIENTATION...
UNCERTAINTY.
AND THE SENSE THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
WAS NOW WITHOUT THE ONE MAN THAT IT NEEDED.
Man:
THIS WAS A MAN OF GREAT EBULLIENCE.
HE WAS A MAN OF CONSTANT CHEER.
HE WAS A MAN OF LAUGHTER.
HE HAD THE FEELING OF LIFE.
THERE WAS VITALITY.
THIS WAS A COUNTRY IN DESPAIR, AND HE BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER.
McCullough:
HE WAS THE MAN WITH THE BIG, EASY SMILE...
THE INFECTIOUS SENSE OF HUMOR.
Reporter:
MR. PRESIDENT, HOW SOON ARE YOU COMING BACK?
JUST AS SOON AS CONGRESS WILL LET ME.
McCullough:
HE LOVED CONVERSATION, COMPANY
AND GOOD TIMES.
LAST YEAR I NEARLY KILLED A PHOTOGRAPHER.
ALL READY?
McCullough:
THIS WAS HOW AMERICANS SAW
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
THIS WAS THE MAN THEY TRUSTED SO MUCH,
THEY ELECTED HIM PRESIDENT FOUR TIMES.
Man:
PEOPLE JUST IDOLIZED HIM.
THE MOST ASTOUNDING THING WAS
THE PICTURES OF ROOSEVELT YOU SAW EVERYWHERE--
BUS STATIONS, LIBRARIES, BARBER SHOPS, HOMES--
THERE WERE PICTURES OF ROOSEVELT.
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY DECIDED HE WAS THE SAVIOR.
WE FACE THE FUTURE WITH CONFIDENCE AND WITH COURAGE.
WE ARE AMERICANS.
(cheering)
McCullough:
NEVER BEFORE ROOSEVELT HAD AMERICANS FELT
THAT GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM:
PROTECT THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FARMS,
GUARANTEE THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,
PROMISE THEM SECURITY IN SICKNESS AND OLD AGE.
BUT THE PRESIDENT WHO CHAMPIONED THE COMMON MAN
WAS NOT LIKE MOST AMERICANS.
McCullough:
"MY DEAR MAMA, I AM IN A GREAT HURRY.
"I FOUND TWO BIRDS' NESTS.
"I TOOK ONE EGG.
YOUR LOVING FRANKLIN."
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT SPENT HIS CHILDHOOD
AMONG PEOPLE SO UNLIKE ORDINARY AMERICANS
THEY MODELED THEMSELVES AFTER THE LORDS AND LADIES OF ENGLAND.
Man:
THE WORLD OF WEALTH AND PRIVILEGE
THAT F.D.R. GREW UP WITH
WAS ONE THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY VERY COMFORTABLE FOR EVERYBODY.
AND THE FAMILIES THAT LIVED ON THOSE ESTATES
WERE GENERALLY FRIENDS OF ONE ANOTHER,
RELATED, VERY OFTEN, TO EACH OTHER
AND WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT VISITED ONE ANOTHER.
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY
THAT EVEN THE PROFESSIONAL MEN IN THE TOWNS
WHO WERE THE DOCTORS AND THE LAWYERS AND SO ON
WERE NOT GENERALLY INVITED TO THE RIVER HOUSES TO DINNER.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WAS BORN IN HYDE PARK, NEW YORK,
ON JANUARY 30, 1882
ON THE BIG, FORESTED ESTATE HIS PARENTS CALLED SPRINGWOOD.
Man:
SPRINGWOOD WAS A BEAUTIFUL, ISOLATED PLACE.
IT WAS ITS OWN WORLD
AND IT WAS ENTIRELY BUILT AROUND THIS PRIVILEGED LITTLE BOY.
AND I THINK HE SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE TRYING
TO REPLICATE THE WAY HIS BOYHOOD WAS ARRANGED.
McCullough:
"AT THE VERY OUTSET,
HE WAS PLUMP, PINK AND NICE," HIS MOTHER SAID.
"I USED TO LOVE TO BATHE AND DRESS HIM."
"HE LOOKED VERY SWEET,
"HIS LITTLE BLOND CURLS BOBBING AS HE RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD
WHENEVER HE THOUGHT I HAD DESIGNS ON COMBING THEM."
NEARLY EVERY DETAIL OF FRANKLIN'S CHILDHOOD
WAS RECORDED WITH SINGLE-MINDED DEVOTION
BY HIS MOTHER, SARA DELANO ROOSEVELT.
SHE KEPT HIS BABY CLOTHES, EVERY CHILDISH DRAWING,
EACH GOLDEN CURL.
FRANKLIN WAS EIGHT-AND-A-HALF YEARS OLD
BEFORE HE WAS ALLOWED TO BATHE HIMSELF.
Ward:
IF IT'S THE JOB OF A MOTHER
TO MAKE HER CHILD FEEL THAT HE OR SHE CAN DO ANYTHING,
THEN SARA DELANO ROOSEVELT WAS SURELY ONE OF THE GREAT MOTHERS
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN'S FATHER
WAS MORE THAN 25 YEARS OLDER THAN SARA.
HE WAS 53 WHEN FRANKLIN WAS BORN.
FRANKLIN CALLED HIM POPSY.
EVERYONE ELSE CALLED HIM MR. JAMES.
MR. JAMES BRED TROTTERS AND RODE TO THE HOUNDS.
HE SMOKED CHEROOTS.
HE WOULD RIDE OUT WITH HIS SON TO SURVEY THEIR ESTATE.
THE WORKERS TIPPED THEIR HATS TO MR. JAMES
AND THEN TO MASTER FRANKLIN.
THE BOY ACCEPTED THESE DISPLAYS OF DEFERENCE AS ROUTINE.
Man:
F.D.R. GREW UP IN A VERY TIGHT LITTLE ISLAND.
HE LEARNED HOW TO PLEASE ADULTS
FROM...
PROBABLY BEFORE HE REMEMBERED.
HIS ACTIVITIES WERE RELATED TO...
SHOWING OFF FOR THEM,
RELATING TO THEM, NOT TO OTHER CHILDREN.
AND HE DIDN'T GO OFF TO PLAY GAMES WITH OTHER CHILDREN.
I DON'T THINK HE EVER SWUNG A BASEBALL BAT
UNTIL HE FINALLY WENT TO SCHOOL.
HE WAS TUTORED AT HOME OR ABROAD
BECAUSE EVERY YEAR THEY WENT ABROAD FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.
F.D.R., WITH ALL THIS ATTENTION, WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A LONELY BOY.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN WANDERED HIS FAMILY ESTATE,
SECURE, HE LATER SAID,
"IN THE PEACEFULNESS AND REGULARITY OF THINGS."
THEN WHEN HE WAS NINE, HIS WELL-ORDERED WORLD FRACTURED.
HIS 63-YEAR-OLD FATHER SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK.
ANY IRRITATION MIGHT AGGRAVATE HIM
PROVOKE ANOTHER HEART ATTACK, AND KILL HIM.
Woman:
HIS FATHER'S SICKNESS
MUST HAVE REINFORCED THE TENDENCY
THAT WAS ALREADY IN HIM AS A SMALL CHILD TO BE A NICE BOY,
TO NEVER MAKE ANY TROUBLE, NEVER MAKE ANYBODY SAD.
NOW HE HAD TO WORRY, "IF I GO IN THERE AND MAKE TROUBLE,
I MAY WEAKEN HIS ALREADY WEAKENED HEART,"
SO IT MUST HAVE PUT AN ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON THIS KID.
McCullough:
WITH AN INFIRM FATHER AND A DOMINEERING MOTHER,
FRANKLIN LEARNED TO CONCEAL HIS TRUE FEELINGS.
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE,
HE WOULD REMAIN A CHARMING BUT DISTANT FIGURE,
EVEN TO THOSE WHO WERE CLOSEST TO HIM.
WHEN HE WAS 14 YEARS OLD,
FRANKLIN LEFT THE RAREFIED WORLD OF HIS HYDE PARK ESTATE.
HIS PATH SEEMED CLEAR:
BOARDING SCHOOL, HARVARD
AND AN UNEVENTFUL LIFE OF LUXURY AND EASE AMONG HIS OWN KIND.
"DEAR MAMA, I AM GETTING ON VERY WELL WITH THE FELLOWS.
"I HAVE NOT HAD ANY BLACK MARKS OR LATENESS YET
AND I AM MUCH BETTER IN MY STUDIES."
Ward:
HIS LETTERS ARE ALWAYS CHEERFUL,
EVERYTHING'S WONDERFUL,
HE'S HAVING A GRAND TIME WITH THE OTHER FELLOWS,
AND YET HE WASN'T.
HE WAS, I THINK, QUITE UNHAPPY.
McCullough:
AT GROTON, A PRIVATE SCHOOL FOR SONS OF THE RICH,
FRANKLIN, WITH ALL HIS CHARM AND SELF-ASSURANCE,
EXPECTED TO EXCEL.
HE DID PLEASE HIS TEACHERS AND TOOK TO HEART
HIS HEADMASTER'S URGINGS TOWARD PUBLIC SERVICE,
BUT HE DID NOT FIT IN WITH THE BOYS.
Curtis Roosevelt:
GROTON WAS HIS FIRST EXPOSURE TO OTHER CHILDREN
ON A REGULAR BASIS.
AFTER ALL, HE BOARDED.
ALL THE CHILDREN BOARDED.
SO HE WAS WITH OTHER BOYS 24 HOURS A DAY,
AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN A RUDE SHOCK
TO COME OUT OF THAT NEST, THAT VERY PROTECTED NEST
WHERE HE WAS THE ONLY BIRD OR CHICK IN THE NEST.
McCullough:
SPORTS MEANT EVERYTHING AT GROTON,
BUT FRANKLIN WAS TOO SLIGHT FOR SUCCESS.
HIS MOTHER WORRIED FRANKLIN MIGHT BE INJURED
AND WROTE THAT HE "NOT HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF HURTING ANYONE."
HE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT BASEBALL,
BUT ONLY CARRIED THE BATS
AND FETCHED THE WATER FOR THE BALLPLAYERS.
Man:
HE WASN'T AN ATHLETE.
HE'D NEVER PLAYED WITH OTHER BOYS GAMES MUCH.
AND THAT WAS VERY BAD INDEED, BECAUSE IT MADE HIM AN OUTSIDER,
AS IF HE DIDN'T BELONG.
AND REALLY IN A STRANGE WAY, HE DIDN'T BELONG.
McCullough:
PLUNGED INTO AN UNFORGIVING WORLD
OF ADOLESCENT BOYS, FRANKLIN NEVER FIT IN.
HIS STRUGGLE FOR ACCEPTANCE ONLY ISOLATED HIM FURTHER.
Potter:
FRANKLIN'S TONE WAS NOT THE GROTON TONE.
HE SEEMED SO DESPERATE FOR APPROVAL.
HE WAS TOO AMBITIOUS AND TOO EAGER,
AND HE WAS VERY MUCH, I WOULD SAY, FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,
VERY CLOSE TO BEING A GOLDEN RETRIEVER.
IN OTHER WORDS, HIS TAIL WAS ALWAYS WAGGING,
EVEN WHEN IT SHOULDN'T BE.
McCullough:
JEFFREY POTTER'S FATHER
WAS THE STAR OF THE BASEBALL TEAM.
"I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS THING ABOUT FRANK," HE SAID
WHEN ROOSEVELT BECAME PRESIDENT.
"HE NEVER AMOUNTED TO MUCH AT SCHOOL."
"AT GROTON," FRANKLIN CONFESSED YEARS LATER,
"SOMETHING HAD GONE SADLY WRONG."
AT HARVARD, HE WAS DETERMINED TO WIN POPULARITY AND RECOGNITION,
AND HE DID SUCCEED.
HE CAMPAIGNED FOR CLASS OFFICE AND WON
AND WAS ELECTED EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE COLLEGE NEWSPAPER.
BUT WHAT HE WANTED EVEN MORE WAS ADMISSION TO PORCELLIAN,
HARVARD'S MOST EXCLUSIVE CLUB.
Chanler:
YOU IMMEDIATELY,
IF YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THE PORCELLIAN CLUB,
WERE RECOGNIZED AS A...
AS WE SAY IN THE CLUB, A BROTHER
BY ALL THE GRADUATES WHO HAD EVER BEEN IN THE PLACE
THAT WERE STILL ALIVE.
BUT IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A NETWORK OF FRIENDSHIPS,
NOT OF POWER, BUT OF FRIENDSHIPS,
BUT THAT COULD LEAD TO POWER.
McCullough:
THE ELECTION WAS SECRET,
HELD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN THE PORCELLIAN CLUBHOUSE.
EACH MEMBER WAS GIVEN ONE WHITE AND ONE BLACK BALL.
A SINGLE BLACK BALL DEPOSITED IN THE WOODEN BALLOT BOX
WAS ALL IT TOOK TO EXCLUDE A CANDIDATE.
HIS FATHER HAD BEEN A MEMBER.
SO HAD OTHER ROOSEVELTS.
FRANKLIN HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT HE WOULD BE CHOSEN TOO.
FRANKLIN WAS BLACKBALLED.
Chanler:
NO DOUBT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FAILED TO BE ELECTED
TO THE PORCELLIAN CLUB FOR THE SIMPLE REASON
THAT SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN THERE AT THE TIME DIDN'T LIKE HIM.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE DONE
ANYTHING PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT.
THE FELLOW WOULD JUST SAY,
"I DON'T LIKE THE CUT OF YOUR JIB,
SO I DON'T WANT YOU IN THERE," AND OUT YOU WENT.
McCullough:
YEARS LATER, WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT
AND THE NEW DEAL AT HIGH TIDE,
THERE WERE THOSE PORCELLIAN MEMBERS
WHO WOULD CALL HIM A TRAITOR TO HIS CLASS
AND ASCRIBE HIS SOCIAL POLICIES TO REVENGE.
Ward:
CERTAINLY NONE OF ROOSEVELT'S CLASSMATES AT HARVARD
IMAGINED THAT HE WOULD EVER BE PRESIDENT.
I THINK THEY WERE THE FIRST OF MANY, MANY PEOPLE
WHO UNDERESTIMATED ROOSEVELT.
McCullough:
WHILE FRANKLIN WAS AT HARVARD,
HIS FATHER, 72 YEARS OLD
AND GROWN FRAIL AND WEAK FROM HEART DISEASE, DIED.
SARA WROTE IN HER DIARY, "ALL IS OVER.
HE MERELY SLEPT AWAY."
NOW HER BOY WAS ALL SHE HAD LEFT.
SHE MOVED TO BOSTON TO BE NEAR HIM.
A FAMILY FRIEND ONCE WROTE:
"SHE WOULD NOT LET HER SON CALL HIS SOUL HIS OWN."
FRANKLIN BEGAN USING A SECRET CODE IN HIS DIARY:
HE WROTE, "E. IS AN ANGEL."
FRANKLIN HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A DISTANT COUSIN.
"E." WAS ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.
FROM THE FIRST, ELEANOR ROOSEVELT SAW
THAT THERE WAS A SERIOUS MAN BENEATH THE EASYGOING CHARM.
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE TOGETHER,
EVEN THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT YEARS OF THEIR MARRIAGE,
SHE WOULD BE DRAWN TO THE SERIOUS SIDE OF HIS NATURE.
Goodwin:
FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR COME FROM THE SAME SOCIAL CLASS.
THERE ARE CERTAIN MORES, CUSTOMS, RITUALS
THAT LINK THEIR CHILDHOODS.
EVERYTHING ELSE IS SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT,
THEY MIGHT HAVE COME FROM THE OTHER ENDS OF THE WORLD.
Eleanor Roosevelt:
I WAS A VERY UGLY LITTLE GIRL.
MY MOTHER WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL.
I THINK SHE ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY HER DAUGHTER HAD TO BE SO UGLY.
I ADORED MY MOTHER,
BUT RATHER LIKE A DISTANT AND BEAUTIFUL THING
THAT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET CLOSE TO.
OH, MY FATHER MEANT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.
I ADORED HIM ALL THE DAYS OF MY CHILDHOOD.
HE CALLED ME LITTLE NELL
AFTER THE LITTLE NELL IN DICKENS'S STORY,
AND I ALWAYS LIKED THAT.
McCullough:
ELEANOR'S CHILDHOOD WAS A SERIES OF LOSSES.
HER PARENTS' MARRIAGE WAS TROUBLED.
ELLIOTT ROOSEVELT WAS AN ALCOHOLIC.
ERRATIC AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE, HE LEFT HOME WHEN SHE WAS SIX.
LESS THAN TWO YEARS LATER, HER MOTHER DIED OF DIPHTHERIA.
THE YEAR AFTER, HER YOUNGER BROTHER DIED
AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR, HER BELOVED, DRUNKEN FATHER DIED.
ELEANOR AND HER BROTHER
WERE LEFT WITH DUTIFUL, RESERVED RELATIVES.
SHE GREW AFRAID OF OTHER CHILDREN, MICE, THE DARK,
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING.
Goodwin:
FROM THE MELANCHOLY LIVES OF BOTH OF HER PARENTS,
ELEANOR TOOK AWAY THE FEELING THAT LOVE NEVER LASTS,
THAT THE WORLD IS A DARK AND FORBIDDING PLACE
AND THAT YOU NEVER CAN COUNT ON ANYTHING.
McCullough:
THEN WHEN SHE WAS 15,
SHE WAS SENT TO AN ENGLISH BOARDING SCHOOL
CALLED ALLENSWOOD,
WHERE SHE WAS ENCOURAGED TO THINK FOR HERSELF,
BE INDEPENDENT, OVERCOME HER FEARS.
Woman:
ALLENSWOOD WAS DEFINITELY A TURNING POINT.
IT WAS THE FIST TIME THAT SHE WAS REALLY ALLOWED TO SHINE,
AND HER OWN SPECIALNESS WAS RECOGNIZED.
THAT IS REALLY WHERE SHE GOT HER SENSE OF SECURITY
AND ALSO HER SENSE OF HER OWN POWER.
McCullough:
THE YEARS SHE SPENT AT ALLENSWOOD, ELEANOR SAID,
WERE THE HAPPIEST OF HER LIFE.
SHE WAS 18 WHEN FRANKLIN BEGAN TO PURSUE HER.
Woman:
HE WAS A GAY AND OUTGOING AND CHARMING YOUNG MAN.
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY SYMPATHETIC ABOUT HIM
AND ROMANTIC
AND THEY HAD A VERY SWEET AND ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP,
ACCORDING TO THEIR EARLY LETTERS.
McCullough:
"WE HAVE HAD TWO HAPPY DAYS TOGETHER,"
SHE WROTE HIM, "AND YOU KNOW HOW GRATEFUL I AM
"FOR EVERY MOMENT WHICH I HAVE WITH YOU.
YOUR DEVOTED LITTLE NELL."
Goodwin:
ELEANOR'S RELATIVES AND FRIENDS THOUGHT OF FRANKLIN
AS A FEATHER-DUSTER, WHICH MEANT
SOMEBODY WHO JUST SKIMMED ALONG THE SURFACE OF LIFE
AND NEVER GOT VERY DEEP INTO ANYTHING AT ALL.
I'M NOT SURE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS A WONDERFUL CATCH FOR HER,
BECAUSE EVEN THEN ELEANOR HAD A CERTAIN VITALITY,
A CERTAIN SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE
THAT MADE PEOPLE FEEL THAT SHE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.
Gurewitsch:
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW DIFFERENT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
FROM THE AVERAGE RUN OF DEBUTANTES OF THE TIME?
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTING
BESIDES BEING TALL, WITH A BEAUTIFUL FIGURE,
FINE, LIGHT HAIR, AND LOVELY SKIN AND GREAT WARMTH.
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE, TOO,
AND THIS IS NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED.
IT DIDN'T HURT HIS COURTSHIP
THAT HER UNCLE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
McCullough:
THEODORE ROOSEVELT WAS A HUGELY POPULAR PRESIDENT:
TIRELESS, VOLUBLE, INSPIRING.
T.R., SOMEONE SAID, WAS A STEAM ENGINE IN TROUSERS.
AS A BOY, FRANKLIN HAD WATCHED WITH PRIDE
HIS DISTANT COUSIN'S SPECTACULAR RISE TO POWER:
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK,
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT," FRANKLIN WOULD LATER SAY,
"WAS THE GREATEST MAN I EVER KNEW."
NOW FRANKLIN WAS COURTING THE PRESIDENT'S FAVORITE NIECE.
THE PRESIDENT WAS DELIGHTED
THAT FRANKLIN HAD PROPOSED MARRIAGE TO ELEANOR.
FRANKLIN'S MOTHER WAS NOT.
FRANKLIN HAD, IN FACT, CONCEALED FROM SARA THE ENTIRE COURTSHIP.
Goodwin:
THE FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH THIS GIRL--
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
THAT WAS HAPPENING IN HER SON'S LIFE--
AND SHE THOUGHT SHE KNEW
EVERY WAKING THOUGHT IN THIS CHILD
FROM THE TIME HE WAS BORN.
McCullough:
"DEAREST MAMA,
"I KNOW WHAT PAIN I MUST HAVE CAUSED YOU
"AND YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T DO IT
"IF I REALLY COULD HAVE HELPED IT, BUT I KNOW MY MIND
AND I AM THE HAPPIEST MAN JUST NOW IN THE WORLD."
Goodwin:
AND FINALLY, SHE HAD TO ACCEPT
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
AND DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD CONTROL ELEANOR
AND THEN SOMEHOW SHE WOULDN'T LOSE FRANKLIN.
Curtis Roosevelt:
I THINK F.D.R. WAS VERY MUCH ATTRACTED
TO MY GRANDMOTHER
BECAUSE THEY WERE TWO LONELY PEOPLE--
TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH THE STANDARDS
AND IDEALS OF THEIR UPPER-CLASS GROUP.
AND I THINK THE TWO OF THEM LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
AND KNEW THAT THEY COULD DRAW STRENGTH FROM EACH OTHER.
McCullough:
ON MARCH 17, 1905, ST.
PATRICK'S DAY,
FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR WERE MARRIED.
HE WAS 23.
SHE WAS 20.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS THERE
TO GIVE AWAY THE BRIDE.
"WELL, FRANKLIN," T.R. TOLD THE GROOM,
"THERE'S NOTHING LIKE KEEPING THE NAME IN THE FAMILY."
THE HONEYMOON WAS A THREE-MONTH GRAND TOUR OF EUROPE.
Goodwin:
ON THE SURFACE, EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE.
THEY'RE SEEING VENICE, THEY'RE SEEING ROME,
BUT AT NIGHTS, ROOSEVELT, ELEANOR REPORTED,
WOULD BE TORMENTED BY NIGHTMARES
AND HE WAS SLEEPWALKING
AND THEN HE BROKE OUT IN HIVES,
ALL OF WHICH SUGGESTED THAT SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.
McCullough:
THEY CLIMBED THE ALPS,
MOTORED THROUGH THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE.
FEW WOULD HAVE SENSED THAT THEY WERE ILL AT EASE.
Ward:
HE LOVED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.
ALL HIS LIFE HE LOVED TO DO THAT.
SHE WANTED SOMEONE SHE COULD CONFIDE IN.
SHE'D BEEN ALONE, REALLY, ALL HER LIFE
AND SHE WANTED AN INTIMATE PARTNER.
SHE DID NOT GET ONE IN FRANKLIN.
HE DIDN'T LIKE SHARING INTIMACIES WITH ANYONE,
EVEN HIS WIFE.
McCullough:
BACK IN AMERICA, SARA WAS WAITING.
"I AM SO GLAD," SARA HAD WRITTEN THEM,
"THAT ALTHOUGH YOU'VE HAD SUCH A PERFECT TIME,
YOU ARE NOW ANXIOUS TO SEE HOME AND MOTHER AGAIN."
THAT WINTER, AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT,
SARA GAVE THEM A DRAWING WITH A NOTE SCRAWLED ON THE BOTTOM:
"TO FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR, FROM MAMA.
NUMBER AND STREET NOT YET QUITE DECIDED."
WHEN FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR ARRIVE HOME
FROM THEIR HONEYMOON, SARA TELLS THEM,
"I'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU.
IT'S GREAT-
- A NEW HOME."
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IT'S FURNISHED BY HER,
IT'S STRUCTURED BY HER, IT'S DECORATED BY HER--
IT'S HER.
McCullough:
SARA BUILT THEM A BROWNSTONE
AND THEN MOVED INTO ITS TWIN NEXT DOOR.
Cook:
THE HOUSE IS FIVE STORIES,
AND ON EACH FLOOR THERE ARE SLIDING DOORS
WHERE SHE CAN WALK FROM HER SIDE OF THE HOUSE INTO THEIR SIDE.
AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WRITES,
"THERE WAS NEVER ANY PRIVACY DAY OR NIGHT."
SARA DELANO ROOSEVELT WAS JUST PART OF THE SCENE.
Curtis Roosevelt:
IN A WAY,
MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER MADE HER DEPENDENT.
SHE WANTED BOTH HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
TO BE DEPENDENT UPON HER.
HIS MOTHER CONTROLLED F.D.R.'s PURSE STRINGS
UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIED IN 1941,
WHEN HE WAS INTO HIS THIRD TERM AS PRESIDENT.
UH, AND...
AND...
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
DIDN'T CONTROL HIS OWN INCOME, HIS MOTHER DID.
Woman:
THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF HER MARRIED LIFE
WERE SPENT HAVING CHILDREN, SIX CHILDREN IN ABOUT TEN YEARS.
SHE LOVED THE CHILDREN,
BUT SHE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO RUN THAT INFANT STAGE.
Gurewitsch:
I THINK SHE WAS TOTALLY INEPT
WHEN IT CAME TO DEALING WITH CHILDREN.
SHE RELIED ON HER MOTHER-IN-LAW AND ON THE VARIOUS GOVERNESSES
AND WAS SO UNSURE OF HERSELF
NOT ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS AN UNSURE PERSON AT THE TIME
BUT SHE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED MOTHER LOVE.
Goodwin:
AND BECAUSE SHE FELT INSECURE
ABOUT NOT KNOWING HOW TO MOTHER HER OWN CHILDREN,
SHE ONCE AGAIN TURNED TO SARA.
SARA KNEW, SARA HAD CONFIDENCE.
SARA HAD AN OPINION ABOUT EVERYTHING.
SO IT WASN'T ONLY THAT THEY BROUGHT IN
NURSES AND GRANNIES TO HELP THE CHILDREN.
SARA WAS THE OVERSEER OF THE HOUSE ENTIRELY AND OF THE KIDS.
Cook:
HIS MOTHER'S EVER-LOOMING PRESENCE
WAS NEVER CHALLENGED.
F.D.R. NEVER WANTED TO MOVE OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S HOME
AND SO THEY LIVED IN SARA DELANO ROOSEVELT'S HOMES.
AT HYDE PARK, IT'S HER HOME,
SO SHE SITS AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE.
FRANKLIN SITS AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE,
AND ELEANOR SITS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WITH THE CHILDREN.
Curtis Roosevelt:
I SEE HER
AS AN UPPER-CLASS GRAND DAME WHO KNEW HER PLACE.
SHE WAS JUST DOING WHAT CAME NATURALLY.
SHE, IN A WAY, KNEW WHO SHE WAS
AND MY GRANDMOTHER, IN THE EARLY YEARS OF HER MARRIAGE,
DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS.
THAT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR HER TO FIND OUT.
McCullough:
IN THE EARLY 1900s, THE ROOSEVELTS APPEARED TO BE
AN UTTERLY CONVENTIONAL UPPER-CLASS COUPLE,
WITH FRANKLIN AMIABLY DABBLING IN THE LAW.
BUT AT 25, HE WAS BORED AND RESTLESS,
LOOKING FOR AN OUTLET FOR HIS ENORMOUS ENERGIES.
TO A FELLOW LAW CLERK
HE CONFIDED A REMARKABLE, SECRET AMBITION.
Man:
HE SAID HE INTENDED TO ENTER POLITICAL LIFE
AS SOON AS HE COULD,
WITH A VIEW TO BECOMING PRESIDENT.
HE SAID THAT MODESTLY ENOUGH, BUT VERY DEFINITELY
AND HE LAID OUT A DEFINITE PLAN.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN TOLD CLARK HE WOULD FOLLOW THE PATH
BLAZED BY HIS HERO, THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
STATE LEGISLATURE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY,
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
COUSIN THEODORE HAD ALREADY PROVED
THAT A GENTLEMAN MIGHT, AS FRANKLIN'S MOTHER SAID,
"GO INTO POLITICS BUT NOT BE A POLITICIAN."
Ward:
THEODORE ROOSEVELT WAS
ALMOST AN OBSESSION WITH FRANKLIN.
WHEN HE WAS TOLD HE HAD TO WEAR GLASSES,
HE GOT PINCE-NEZ AND PUT THEM ON HIS NOSE
BECAUSE THEODORE ROOSEVELT WORE PINCE-NEZ.
HE WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE "BULLY" AND "DE
- LIGHTED"
WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO THE PRESS EARLY IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER.
HE WAS FASCINATED BY HIS ENERGY, HIS ENTHUSIASM,
ABOVE ALL, I THINK, IN HIS FEELING
THAT GOVERNMENT COULD DO ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF GOOD.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT WAS THE GREAT MODEL FOR FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
McCullough:
IN 1910, AT THE AGE OF 28, FRANKLIN JUMPED AT THE CHANCE
TO FOLLOW IN HIS COUSIN THEODORE'S FOOTSTEPS.
HE WAS INVITED TO RUN FOR THE STATE SENATE,
MOSTLY BECAUSE HIS LAST NAME WAS ROOSEVELT.
HE RAN AS A DEMOCRAT, ALTHOUGH T.R. WAS A REPUBLICAN.
Ward:
HIS FATHER HAD BEEN A DEMOCRAT,
BUT I THINK THE REAL REASON WAS
THAT THEODORE ROOSEVELT HAD SEVERAL SONS,
ALL OF WHOM, EVERYONE PRESUMED,
WERE GOING TO HAVE POLITICAL CAREERS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
AND THERE WAS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH ROOM
FOR ANOTHER REPUBLICAN ROOSEVELT.
Eleanor Roosevelt:
HE WAS OFFERED THE IMPOSSIBLE TASK
OF RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN DUTCHESS COUNTY.
NO DEMOCRAT HAD EVER BEEN ELECTED IN 32 YEARS.
HE WASN'T A VERY GOOD SPEAKER IN THOSE EARLY DAYS.
THERE WOULD BE HORRIBLE LONG PAUSES
AND I WOULD WONDER WHETHER HE WAS EVER GOING ON AGAIN.
AND HE MADE A VERY VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN...
AND IT JUST HAPPENED THAT THAT YEAR WAS A DEMOCRATIC SWEEP
AND HE GOT IN.
OTHERWISE, I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE STARTED THEN AT ALL.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN CELEBRATED
BY HANDING OUT $14.00 WORTH OF GOOD CIGARS.
IN ALBANY, IN THE ROUGH-AND- TUMBLE WORLD OF STATE POLITICS,
HE BEGAN HIS CAREER IN THE STYLE OF HIS COUSIN THEODORE.
WITHIN DAYS OF BEING SWORN IN,
HE LED A REBELLION AGAINST THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS OWN PARTY.
HE LOST AND THE BOSSES NEVER FORGAVE HIM.
Ward:
PARTY REGULARS COULDN'T STAND HIM.
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS RICH, SPOILED,
UNWILLING TO COMPROMISE OR COOPERATE--
UH, A SNOB.
McCullough:
"THIS FELLOW IS STILL YOUNG," ONE OF THEM SAID.
"WOULDN'T IT BE SAFER TO DROWN HIM BEFORE HE GROWS UP?"
TO SURVIVE, FRANKLIN WOULD NEED HELP,
AND HE TURNED TO A SHREWD, STRANGE-LOOKING REPORTER--
LOUIS HOWE.
Curtis Roosevelt:
I REMEMBER THE SMELL OF LOUIS HOWE
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
A GNOME-
- GAUNT, SHORT, WISPY HAIR.
I MEAN, ENOUGH TO SCARE A CHILD, AND I WAS.
Cook:
HE'S DIRTY, HE NEVER SHOWERS OR BATHES ENOUGH.
HE SMOKES THESE DREADFUL, SMELLY,
SWEET, CORPORAL CIGARETTES
AND THE ASHES, YOU KNOW, SORT OF COAT HIS VEST AND TIE.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN'S MOTHER ESPECIALLY DISLIKED HIM.
"THAT DIRTY LITTLE MAN," SHE CALLED HIM.
ELEANOR, TOO, DISAPPROVED.
Cook:
THEY WANT HIM OUT.
HE REPRESENTS THE WORST,
THE SMELLIEST, YOU KNOW, STUFF OF POLITICS.
UM, HE DRINKS, HE SMOKES, HE CURSES, HE'S A PAIN.
OUT OF THERE.
BUT STILL, LOUIS HOWE WAS A SEASONED POLITICIAN.
AS YOU MIGHT SAY, HE KNEW WHERE ALL THE BODIES WERE BURIED.
AND F.D.R. NEEDED TO KNOW.
McCullough:
TOGETHER, HOWE AND FRANKLIN FORMED
ONE OF THE ODDEST ALLIANCES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY.
IT WOULD LAST UNTIL HOWE'S DEATH IN 1936.
"I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT,"
HOWE LIKED TO SAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING,
"I THOUGHT THEN NOTHING BUT AN ACCIDENT COULD KEEP HIM
FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."
IN 1913, AFTER ONLY TWO YEARS IN ALBANY,
THE DEMOCRATIC STATE SENATOR WITH THE FAMOUS LAST NAME
WAS SUMMONED TO WASHINGTON.
IMPRESSED BY HIS GROWING REPUTATION AS A REFORM DEMOCRAT
AND BY FRANKLIN'S PEDIGREE,
PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON OFFERED HIM
THE JOB OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY--
THE SAME JOB THAT THEODORE ROOSEVELT HAD USED
TO CATAPULT HIMSELF TO THE PRESIDENCY.
HE WAS JUST 31 YEARS OLD.
FRANKLIN LOVED THE NAVY.
HE PRESSED FOR THE LARGEST POSSIBLE FLEET.
HE LEARNED TO DEAL WITH CONGRESS, BUSINESSMEN, LABOR,
AND HE BUILT A REPUTATION
AS ENTHUSIASTIC, EFFICIENT, HARDWORKING.
BUT JUST AS HE BEGAN TO WALK THE CORRIDORS OF REAL POWER,
FIRST HE PUT HIS JOB, AND THEN HIS MARRIAGE, IN JEOPARDY.
Cook:
WASHINGTON FOR FRANKLIN IS A GREAT LIBERATION.
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER HAD A TEENAGE REBELLION.
HE NEVER HAD A MOMENT WHERE HE DEFIED HIS MOTHER OR HIS WIFE.
HE HAD REALLY BEEN A DUTIFUL SON
AND HE HAD REALLY BEEN A DUTIFUL HUSBAND.
WASHINGTON BLEW ALL THAT OUT OF THE WATER,
IF I MAY USE A NAVAL TERM
FOR THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.
McCullough:
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN ON THE MAKE.
HE WORKED FOR SECRETARY OF THE NAVY JOSEPHUS DANIELS,
AND HE WANTED HIS JOB, RIDICULED HIM BEHIND HIS BACK,
UNDERMINED HIS DECISIONS.
Ward:
F.D.R. WORKED AS A SUBORDINATE
UNDER JOSEPHUS DANIELS FOR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS,
AND HE WAS A TERRIBLE SUBORDINATE.
I THINK HE SIMPLY COULDN'T STAND THE NOTION
THAT SOMEONE WAS GIVING HIM ORDERS
ABOUT SOMETHING HE WAS QUITE SURE HE KNEW MUCH MORE ABOUT.
ROOSEVELT UNDERCUT HIS BOSS TIME AND AGAIN.
HE WENT OVER HIS HEAD TO THE PRESIDENT FROM TIME TO TIME,
AND DANIELS PUT UP WITH ALL OF IT.
McCullough:
DANIELS SAID HE ENJOYED
FRANKLIN'S "SPONTANEITY AND GAIETY,"
IMAGINING GREAT THINGS FOR HIM.
WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THEIR PICTURE TAKEN TOGETHER,
DANIELS TOLD HIM, "I'LL TELL YOU WHY YOU'RE SMILING.
"WE'RE BOTH LOOKING DOWN ON THE WHITE HOUSE
"AND YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF,
'SOME DAY I WILL BE LIVING IN THAT HOUSE.'"
FRANKLIN JUST KEPT SMILING.
Ward:
DANIELS THOUGHT ROOSEVELT
A WONDERFULLY CHARMING YOUNG MAN AND, I THINK, MUST HAVE BEEN
THE MOST PATIENT MAN IN AMERICAN HISTORY,
BECAUSE ANY OTHER MAN WOULD HAVE FIRED ROOSEVELT
FOR INSUBORDINATION EARLY ON.
McCullough:
AT THE SAME TIME,
FRANKLIN'S MARRIAGE WAS HEADING FOR TROUBLE.
Curtis Roosevelt:
IT WAS NOT A HAPPY HOUSEHOLD.
F.D.R. ENJOYED HIMSELF.
HE ENJOYED HAVING A GOOD TIME
AND UNFORTUNATELY, HE COULDN'T GET MY GRANDMOTHER TO GO ALONG.
SHE ACTUALLY DISAPPROVED.
SHE HAD MORAL RESERVATIONS, IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN PUT IT,
ABOUT REALLY ENJOYING HERSELF.
McCullough:
ELEANOR WAS CAUGHT IN WHAT SHE DESCRIBED
AS "THE SLAVERY OF THE WASHINGTON SOCIAL SYSTEM,"
DUTIFULLY ADVANCING HER HUSBAND'S CAREER.
OVERWHELMED WITH SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS,
SHE SPENT HER DAYS LEAVING HER CALLING CARDS
AT THE STATELY HOMES OF THE RICH AND POWERFUL.
"I WAS PERFECTLY CERTAIN," ELEANOR LATER WROTE,
"THAT I HAD NOTHING TO OFFER
"AND THAT MY DUTY AS THE WIFE OF A PUBLIC OFFICIAL WAS TO DO
EXACTLY AS THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WERE DOING."
AND SUDDENLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE
PART OF THE SOCIAL WHIRL OF WASHINGTON, D.C.,
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A ROUND OF COCKTAIL PARTIES,
TRIVIAL CONVERSATION--
THE VERY THING THAT ELEANOR HATES.
FRANKLIN FINDS OUT THAT HE'S INCREDIBLY WELL-SUITED
FOR THE SMALL TALK, GOSSIPY SIDE OF WASHINGTON LIFE.
HE'S A GREAT CONVERSATIONALIST.
HE LOVES TELLING STORIES.
HE LOVES SMALL TALK, AND HE LOVES
THAT KIND OF SUPERFICIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE,
AND HIS VITALITY AND HIS MAGNETISM ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN WAS ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN.
ONE WASHINGTON HOSTESS DESCRIBED HIM
AS THE MOST "DESIRABLE" MAN SHE HAD EVER MET.
EVERY SUMMER, THE ROOSEVELTS SEEMED TO FIND
RELIEF FROM THE STRAINS OF WASHINGTON
ON AN ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF MAINE-
- CAMPOBELLO.
"WE SPENT SO LITTLE TIME ALONE WITH OUR PARENTS,"
THEIR ELDEST SON JAMES LATER WROTE,
"THAT THOSE TIMES ARE TREASURED AS THOUGH GIFTS FROM THE GODS."
"FATHER LOVED LIFE ON THE ISLAND MORE THAN ANY OF US,
BUT GOT TO SPEND THE LEAST TIME THERE."
"MOTHER ALWAYS LIKED IT BECAUSE SHE HAD HER OWN HOME,
WHICH SHE RAN."
"FATHER TAUGHT US TO SAIL.
"THIS WAS THE ONE ACTIVITY HE LOVED ABOVE ALL OTHERS
AND WANTED US TO LOVE."
BUT AS SUMMER AFTER SUMMER WENT BY,
FRANKLIN SPENT LESS AND LESS TIME AT CAMPOBELLO.
ELEANOR GREW ANXIOUS AND SUSPICIOUS.
IN THE SUMMER OF 1917,
FRANKLIN WROTE FROM WASHINGTON TO CALM HER:
"DEAREST BABS, YOU WERE A GOOSY GIRL TO THINK,
"OR EVEN PRETEND TO THINK,
"THAT I DON'T WANT YOU HERE ALL SUMMER,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DO."
"BUT HONESTLY, YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SIX WEEKS STRAIGHT AT CAMPO
JUST AS I OUGHT TO, ONLY YOU CAN AND I CAN'T."
McCullough:
WHEN AMERICA ENTERED WORLD WAR I,
THE NAVY SENT FRANKLIN
ON AN INSPECTION TOUR OF THE WESTERN FRONT.
HE REVIEWED THE TROOPS, TOURED THE BATTLEFIELDS
AND GOT AS CLOSE TO THE FIGHTING AS THE MILITARY WOULD ALLOW HIM.
AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SAIL BACK TO AMERICA,
HE WAS STRUCK DOWN BY A STRAIN OF INFLUENZA
AND BROUGHT HOME SEVERELY ILL.
FRANKLIN WAS 36 YEARS OLD.
HE HAD HANDSOME CHILDREN, A DUTIFUL WIFE, A FAMOUS NAME
AND A RISING CAREER.
AS ELEANOR UNPACKED HIS SUITCASE,
SHE ACCIDENTALLY MADE A DISCOVERY
THAT WOULD CHANGE THEIR LIVES FOREVER--
A PACKET OF LOVE LETTERS TO HER HUSBAND.
LUCY PAGE MERCER WAS ELEANOR'S OWN SOCIAL SECRETARY.
SHE WAS A REFINED YOUNG WOMAN
FROM AN OLD, SOUTHERN, CATHOLIC FAMILY.
Goodwin:
LUCY WAS TALL AND STATUESQUE.
SHE HAD A FACE, PEOPLE SAY, THAT BELONGED IN DRAWING ROOMS.
SHE HAD A CHARM
THAT WAS RIVALED ONLY BY FRANKLIN'S CHARM.
ONE THINKS OF FRANKLIN IN THOSE DAYS,
AND INDEED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, AS THIS INCORRIGIBLE FLIRT.
FLIRTING WAS A PART OF HIS VITALITY,
HIS MAGNETISM, HIS CHARM.
HE LOVED TO CONQUER WOMEN IN CONVERSATION.
SO THAT'S PROBABLY HOW IT STARTED WITH LUCY,
BUT THEN I DO THINK IT BECAME SOMETHING MORE.
McCullough:
WHILE ELEANOR WAS AWAY AT CAMPOBELLO,
FRANKLIN SPENT TIME WITH LUCY ALONE
AND EVEN APPEARED WITH HER AT DINNER PARTIES.
HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE.
Cook:
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT REALLY HAD A VERY ROMANTIC IDEA
THAT SHE COULD HAVE A PERFECT MARRIAGE,
THAT THEY WOULD LOVE AND TRUST AND RESPECT EACH OTHER
AND BE PARTNERS IN LOVE THE WAY HER PARENTS NEVER WERE,
WHICH IS, I THINK,
WHY HER DISCOVERY OF THE LUCY MERCER AFFAIR
WAS SO DEVASTATING TO HER.
McCullough:
"THE BOTTOM DROPPED OUT OF MY OWN PARTICULAR WORLD,"
ELEANOR CONFIDED TO A FRIEND,
"AND I FACED MYSELF, MY SURROUNDINGS, MY WORLD
HONESTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME."
Goodwin:
ELEANOR'S IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
WAS NOT ONLY TO CONFRONT FRANKLIN,
BUT FROM WHAT WE SEEM TO UNDERSTAND,
TO OFFER HIM A DIVORCE-- "IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT, GO."
Gurewitsch:
MR. ROOSEVELT KNEW
THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD WITHDRAW ALL FINANCIAL HELP.
SHE THREATENED HIM WITH THAT.
HE WOULD LOSE HIS FAMILY LIFE.
AND IT REALLY MEANT GIVING UP HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS,
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING HE HAD TO THINK OVER MORE THAN ONCE.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS LOVE FOR LUCY MERCER
AND HIS POLITICAL CAREER, FAMILY AND ELEANOR.
Gurewitsch:
AND HE FINALLY DECIDED TO STAY MARRIED
AND TO TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF A MARRIAGE,
AND MRS. ROOSEVELT'S CONDITION WAS
THAT HE NEVER SEE LUCY MERCER AGAIN.
McCullough:
"AFTER EVERYONE HAD THEIR SAY," JAMES LATER WROTE,
"FATHER AND MOTHER SAT DOWN AND AGREED TO GO ON
FOR THE SAKE OF APPEARANCES."
ELEANOR AND FRANKLIN WOULD LIVE TOGETHER,
BUT NEVER AGAIN SHARE THE INTIMACIES OF MARRIED LIFE.
DEVASTATED, ELEANOR WENT TIME AND AGAIN
TO WASHINGTON'S ROCK CREEK CEMETERY.
FOR HOURS SHE SAT GAZING AT A MONUMENT
TO A WOMAN WHO HAD KILLED HERSELF.
ALL HER CHILDHOOD FEARS HAD BEEN CONFIRMED.
THOSE SHE LOVED MOST-
- FIRST HER FATHER, NOW HER HUSBAND--
WOULD ALWAYS DESERT HER.
NOTHING LASTED.
Gurewitsch:
IT WAS A MARKED TURNING POINT IN HER LIFE.
SHE HAD NO PERSONA, SHE FELT DESTROYED.
SHE'D HAVE TO MAKE A LIFE FOR HERSELF
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.
McCullough:
THE SURPRISE OF THE 1920 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION WAS
THE NOMINATION FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.
"THE YOUNG MAN I AM GOING TO SUGGEST," THE SPEAKER SAID,
"HAS A NAME TO BE CONJURED WITH IN AMERICAN POLITICS."
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT WAS 38,
ONE OF THE YOUNGEST VICE- PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
HIS COUSIN THEODORE HAD BEEN 42 AT THIS POINT IN HIS CAREER.
FRANKLIN WAS NOW AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.
AS THE CAMPAIGN GOT UNDER WAY,
HE THREW OPEN HIS MOTHER'S HYDE PARK HOME FOR A PARTY RALLY.
SARA WAS PROUD...
BUT APPALLED WHEN 5,000 LOYAL DEMOCRATS TRAMPLED HER LAWN
AND INVADED HER STATELY HOME.
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES USUALLY RAN MODEST CAMPAIGNS,
BUT FRANKLIN BARNSTORMED MORE THAN 8,000 MILES
THROUGH 20 STATES IN 18 DAYS.
"DURING THE THREE MONTHS IN THE YEAR 1920," HE SAID,
"I GOT TO KNOW THE COUNTRY AS ONLY A CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE
OR A TRAVELING SALESMAN CAN GET TO KNOW IT."
FRANKLIN PRESSED ELEANOR TO ACCOMPANY HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN.
RELUCTANTLY SHE WENT ALONG...
AND HATED EVERY MINUTE OF IT:
THE SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS, THE LATE-NIGHT CARD GAMES,
THE HARD-DRINKING POLITICIANS AND REPORTERS.
EVER SINCE HER DISCOVERY OF HER HUSBAND'S AFFAIR,
SHE HAD BEEN CAUTIOUSLY EMBRACING A LIFE OF HER OWN.
Goodwin:
BEFORE LUCY CAME INTO THEIR LIVES,
MY OWN SENSE IS THAT ELEANOR WAS NOT HAPPY
SIMPLY AS A WIFE AND A MOTHER,
BUT SHE HAD NO OUTLET FOR HER ENERGY.
SHE HAD TORRENTIAL ENERGY AND THERE WAS NO OUTLET FOR IT,
BECAUSE IN THAT DAY AND AGE IT WASN'T LEGITIMATE
FOR A WOMAN TO HAVE A CAREER OUTSIDE THE HOME.
Curtis Roosevelt:
THE AFFAIR WITH LUCY MERCER
ENABLED HER TO SEE HERSELF IN PERHAPS A DIFFERENT LIGHT,
AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT F.D.R.'s AFFAIR WITH LUCY MERCER
ENABLED MY GRANDMOTHER TO OPEN A DOOR AND WALK OUT.
Cook:
SHE MEETS WITH ALL OF THESE POLITICAL WOMEN:
THEY WERE SUFFRAGISTS, THEY WERE PROGRESSIVES,
THEY'RE DEDICATED TO MAKING THINGS BETTER
FOR MOST PEOPLE.
Gurewitsch:
THEY WERE WOMEN WHO KNEW THINGS,
WHO COULD EDUCATE HER,
WHO COULD TEACH HER PARLIAMENTARY LAW,
WHO COULD TELL HER ABOUT LABOR MOVEMENTS,
LABOR UNIONS, AND SO ON.
IT ALSO WAS SLIGHTLY REBELLIOUS OF HER.
SHE WAS BREAKING BOUNDS.
McCullough:
ELEANOR WAS MOVING INTO A VANGUARD OF WOMEN
WHO WERE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS.
IN 1920, WOMEN WERE VOTING IN THEIR FIRST NATIONAL ELECTION...
AND FRANKLIN, NEVER MISSING A POLITICAL BEAT,
WAS ARDENTLY COURTING THEIR VOTE.
HE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THE 1920 CAMPAIGN,
BUT WHEN AN AIDE ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE ELECTED,
HE REPLIED, "NARY AN ILLUSION."
FOR THE DEMOCRATS, THE ELECTION WAS A DISASTER.
FOR THE REPUBLICANS, "THE VICTORY," ONE OBSERVER SAID,
"WAS MORE THAN A LANDSLIDE, IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE."
BUT FOR FRANKLIN, THE CAMPAIGN WAS A TRIUMPH.
AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW KNEW HIS NAME.
HE HAD MET AND WON THE GOODWILL OF THOUSANDS OF PARTY LEADERS.
HE STOOD READY TO AIM HIGHER
THAN THE VICE-PRESIDENCY NEXT TIME.
AT 38, HE WAS YOUNG, STRONG, ENERGETIC AND IMPATIENT.
IN THE SUMMER OF 1921,
HE VISITED A BOY SCOUT CAMP SERVING CITY CHILDREN.
HE ENJOYED HIMSELF IMMENSELY,
POSING FOR PICTURES FOR THE NEWSPAPERS
AND JOKING WITH THE BOYS.
THIS IS THE LAST PHOTOGRAPH
OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT STANDING ON HIS OWN TWO FEET.
WHEN HE SAID GOOD-BYE,
HE TOOK WITH HIM THE GOODWILL OF THE CAMPERS
AND A MYSTERIOUS, UNDETECTED VIRUS
ALREADY MULTIPLYING AND CIRCULATING THROUGHOUT HIS BODY.
McCullough:
AUGUST 14, 1921.
"WE HAVE HAD A VERY FEW ANXIOUS DAYS,"
ELEANOR WROTE FROM CAMPOBELLO.
"WEDNESDAY EVENING FRANKLIN WAS TAKEN ILL."
"BY FRIDAY EVENING,
"HE LOST THE ABILITY TO WALK OR MOVE HIS LEGS.
"THE DOCTOR FEELS SURE HE WILL GET WELL,
BUT IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME."
"I TRIED TO PERSUADE MYSELF
THAT THE TROUBLE WITH MY LEG WAS MUSCULAR,"
FRANKLIN REMEMBERED,
"THAT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR AS I USED IT.
BUT PRESENTLY IT REFUSED TO WORK, AND THEN THE OTHER."
Man:
IT STARTED WITH A COLD, A FEELING OF MALAISE,
AN ACHE IN THE BACK AND LACK OF APPETITE.
HE SAID HE THOUGHT HE WOULDN'T HAVE DINNER
AND HE WENT UP TO HIS ROOM.
AND HE NEVER WALKED AGAIN.
AND ULTIMATELY AT THE HIGH POINT, HE WAS HELPLESS.
Ward:
FOR A MAN AS ENERGETIC, WHO HAD LED SUCH A CHARMED LIFE,
TO SUDDENLY BE PARALYZED MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST UNBEARABLE.
HE...
HE ASKED LOUIS HOWE
WHY GOD HAD DESERTED HIM, AT ONE POINT.
HE TRIED TO PUT ON A BRAVE FRONT WITH THE CHILDREN,
BUT HE WAS TERRIFIED.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT.
CERTAINLY IT WAS THE BLACKEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE
AND SEEMED TO BE THE END OF HIS LIFE.
McCullough:
HIS FEVER SOARED.
ELEANOR REMEMBERED HE WAS "OUT OF HIS HEAD."
Goodwin:
ELEANOR RESPONDS IMMEDIATELY
WITH HELP, WITH SUPPORT, WITH COURAGE IN FACING
THE SEVERITY OF WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH.
SHE STAYS UP 24 HOURS.
SHE'S BY HIS SIDE.
SHE DOESN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT.
McCullough:
DESPERATE, ELEANOR CALLED IN
AN ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALIST FROM HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL.
THE DIAGNOSIS, HE TOLD THEM, WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR:
INFANTILE PARALYSIS-
- POLIO.
Ward:
HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS HAD HAPPENED TO HIM,
BUT EVEN IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, HE KEPT TO THE ROOSEVELT CODE,
WHICH WAS THAT YOU DID NOT COMPLAIN
AND THAT YOU TRIED TO CONVINCE EVERYONE
THAT EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE FINE.
HE WAS VERY CAREFUL
TO BE CHEERFUL IN FRONT OF HIS MOTHER.
AND SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL TO BE CHEERFUL IN FRONT OF HIM,
AND ONLY AFTER SHE LEFT HIM DID SHE CRY.
McCullough:
A PRIVATE RAILROAD CAR BROUGHT FRANKLIN HOME
TO NEW YORK CITY.
WITH EVERY CURVE AND JOUNCE, HE WINCED IN PAIN.
HE WAS 39 YEARS OLD.
NO ONE KNEW WHAT SORT OF LIFE MIGHT NOW BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM,
BUT ONE THING SEEMED CERTAIN:
HIS POLITICAL CAREER WAS FINISHED.
Gallagher:
HE WAS AN ARISTOCRAT,
HE WAS WELL BORN, HE WAS GOOD-LOOKING.
HE HAD HAD...
ALWAYS HAD EVERYTHING.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE HE WAS, CRIPPLED IN A DAY
WHEN IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO BE CRIPPLED.
IN THE 1920s, WHY, POLIO WAS A TERRIFYING THING.
SOMETHING LIKE 25% OF PEOPLE WHO CAUGHT POLIO
DIED OF IT WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS.
IF YOU SURVIVED AND YOU HAD PARALYSIS,
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AND "NICE" FAMILIES KEPT THEIR DISABLED MEMBERS AT HOME
IN THE BACK BEDROOM WITH THE BLINDS DRAWN.
THERE WAS A CERTAIN SHAME ATTACHED TO IT SOMEHOW.
Ward:
HIS MOTHER DECIDED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO
WAS FOR HIM TO COME HOME TO HYDE PARK
AND TO LIVE THE LIFE
REALLY THAT HIS FATHER HAD LIVED, AS AN INVALID.
SHE WOULD TAKE CARE OF HIM,
AND HE COULD PURSUE HIS HOBBIES AND SMALL INTERESTS,
BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP POLITICS.
Goodwin:
IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A DEFINING MOMENT FOR ELEANOR,
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT IF SARA HAS HER WAY,
FRANKLIN'S SOUL WILL BE DESTROYED.
SO SHE HAS TO DO SOMETHING SHE'S NEVER DONE BEFORE:
SHE HAS TO CONFRONT SARA DIRECTLY TO TELL HER
"YOU'RE WRONG AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THIS HAPPEN.
"HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE.
"HE'S GOING TO WALK AGAIN,
HE'S GOING TO GET INTO POLITICS AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY."
SHE MAY NOT HAVE SAID IT THAT BOLDLY,
BUT SHE DEFINITELY WAS WILLING
TO MAKE A MAJOR CONFRONTATION WITH HER MOTHER-IN-LAW
THAT ALL OF HER EARLIER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE.
SHE BECAME THE VOICE FOR HIS INNER NEEDS, HIS INNER FEELINGS,
AND IN SOME WAYS, THAT'S WHAT SHE BECOMES ALL OF THEIR LIVES.
Gurewitsch:
SHE HAD A DISCIPLINE
AND A WILLPOWER THAT WAS STAGGERING.
SHE SAID TO ME ONCE, "THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE
"THAT I CRIED IN HIS PRESENCE WHEN HE HAD POLIO
"WAS WHEN HE CALLED US INTO THE ROOM
"AND HE SHOWED US:
'LOOK,' HE SAID, 'WHAT I CAN DO.'"
HE WAS PHOBIC ABOUT BEING CAUGHT IN A FIRE-
- HELPLESS IN A FIRE.
HE GOT HIMSELF DOWN FROM THE BED
AND HE SHOWED THEM WITH GREAT PRIDE
HOW HE SLITHERED ON THE FLOOR,
USING HIS ELBOWS TO GET TO THE DOOR.
AND WITH THAT, MRS. ROOSEVELT BROKE DOWN IN TEARS AND FLED.
AND SHE SAID THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME
SHE DIDN'T CONTROL HERSELF IN FRONT OF HIM.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN'S LIFE WAS NOW IN LIMBO.
HE WOULD DEVOTE THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS TO ONE SINGLE GOAL:
TO GET BACK ON HIS FEET.
THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM THAT HIS ONLY HOPE WAS EXERCISE.
WITH HEAVY STEEL BRACES GRAPPLED TO HIS LEGS,
HE BEGAN THE AWKWARD STRUGGLE TO LEARN TO WALK.
"I MUST GET DOWN THE DRIVEWAY TODAY--
ALL THE WAY DOWN THE DRIVEWAY," HIS DAUGHTER ANNA HEARD HIM SAY.
Ward:
POLIO EXERCISES WERE VERY PAINFUL,
VERY TEDIOUS, HUMILIATING.
THEY TOOK UP ENDLESS TIME,
AND I THINK IT'S A MEASURE OF HIS AMBITION AND HIS GRIT
THAT HE KEPT AT THEM AS LONG AND AS HARD AS HE DID.
McCullough:
AFTER A YEAR OF UNRELENTING STRUGGLE,
THE DOCTORS TOLD FRANKLIN
IT WAS ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD NEVER WALK AGAIN.
BUT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THEIR VERDICT.
Ward:
THE RULES THAT APPLIED TO OTHER PEOPLE
DID NOT APPLY TO FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT,
AND HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET BETTER.
HE TRIED EVERYTHING:
SUNLAMP TREATMENTS,
SPECIAL ELECTRIC BELTS
THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE HIM SOMEHOW STRONGER,
PULLEY ARRANGEMENTS TO DO HIS EXERCISES AUTOMATICALLY.
DEEP MASSAGE, LIGHT MASSAGE, RANGE OF MOTION EXERCISES.
SOMETIMES THEY HUNG HIM ON A HARNESS FROM THE CEILING.
AND EVEN IN THE LAST WEEKS OF HIS LIFE,
HE WAS TRYING A NEW METHOD
TO SEE IF HE COULDN'T GET BACK ON HIS FEET.
IT'S...
IT'S EITHER MADNESS OR ENORMOUSLY ADMIRABLE.
Gallagher:
HE NEVER SPOKE TO ANYONE
ABOUT THE FEELINGS HE HAD WITH HIS PARALYSIS.
HIS MOTHER SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HER ABOUT IT.
ELEANOR SAID HE SIMPLY DIDN'T ACCEPT HIS PARALYSIS
AND HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT AND HE WOULDN'T ADMIT IT.
I SUPPOSE PSYCHOLOGISTS MIGHT CALL IT DENIAL.
IT CERTAINLY SERVED HIM WELL
AND ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
INSTEAD OF A STAMP-COLLECTING INVALID.
OF COURSE IT'S DENIAL.
IT WORKED-
- DENIAL IS A VERY USEFUL THING IN ITS PLACE.
I MEAN IT'S...
IT'S A WAY OF...
OF COMING TO TERMS WITH A DIFFICULT FACT.
McCullough:
IN 1924, FRANKLIN BOUGHT
A RUN-DOWN HOUSEBOAT HE NAMED "THE LAROOCO" AND HEADED SOUTH.
HE WAS RUNNING AWAY.
DRIFTING LAZILY OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA:
SWIMMING, FISHING,
CAVORTING WITH HIS FRIENDS,
HE FILLED HIS DAYS WITH AIMLESS GOOD TIMES.
Ward:
HE WAS THERE PARTLY TO EXERCISE
AND GET THE SUN, WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HELP HIM,
BUT HE WAS ALSO THERE BECAUSE LIFE AT HOME WITH FIVE CHILDREN
AND HIS MOTHER AND HIS WIFE FIGHTING OVER HIM
WAS UNBEARABLE.
Gallagher:
THESE WERE VERY GRIM YEARS FOR HIM, FOR THE FAMILY.
HE WAS STRUGGLING TO GET BETTER.
IN SPITE OF HIS OPTIMISM,
HE REALLY WASN'T GETTING MUCH BETTER.
I THINK THAT THE GUY WAS DEALING WITH DEPRESSION.
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF ANGER, A GREAT DEAL OF GRIEVING,
A GREAT DEAL OF FRUSTRATION THAT COMES WITH PARALYSIS--
EXTENSIVE, SEVERE, SERIOUS PARALYSIS--
AND THIS IS VERY HARD STUFF TO...
TO DEAL WITH.
Goodwin:
AND HE COULDN'T EXPRESS
THAT DESPAIR AND THAT SADNESS AROUND ELEANOR,
CERTAINLY NOT AROUND HIS MOTHER, NOR AROUND THE KIDS.
SO I THINK HE WENT TO THE LAROOCO ORIGINALLY
BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM A HAVEN TO BE ABLE TO BE SAD,
TO MOURN THE LOSS OF THE BODY THAT HAD ONCE BEEN HIS,
AND I THINK IT TOOK LONGER THAN HE THOUGHT.
McCullough:
"THERE WERE DAYS ON THE LAROOCO,"
ONE FRIEND REMEMBERED,
"WHEN IT WAS NOON
"BEFORE HE COULD PULL HIMSELF OUT OF DEPRESSION
AND GREET HIS GUESTS WEARING HIS LIGHTHEARTED FACADE."
"POLIO WAS A STORM," ONE OF HIS PHYSIOTHERAPISTS SAID.
"YOU WERE WHAT REMAINED WHEN IT HAD PASSED."
HIS SON JAMES LATER WROTE:
"THESE WERE THE LONELY YEARS.
"WE HAD NO TANGIBLE FATHER,
"NO FATHER WHOM WE COULD TOUCH AND TALK TO,
ONLY A CHEERY LETTER WRITER."
WITH FRANKLIN GONE
AND THE CHILDREN AWAY AT SCHOOL OR GROWN UP,
POLITICS WAS BECOMING
AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PART OF ELEANOR'S LIFE.
LOUIS HOWE CONVINCED HER
THAT IT WAS UP TO HER TO KEEP FRANKLIN'S NAME ALIVE.
IF ELEANOR HAD NOT STEPPED FORWARD,
FRANKLIN'S POLITICAL CAREER MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN OVER.
Eleanor Roosevelt:
LOUIS HOWE DECIDED
THAT I'D BETTER GO IN THE WOMEN'S DIVISION
OF THE STATE POLITICAL SETUP IN NEW YORK
AND I MUST BE ABLE TO SPEAK,
AND SO LOUIS HOWE USED TO GO WITH ME TO MEETINGS
AND SIT IN THE BACK AND MAKE FUN OF ME AFTERWARDS.
Cook:
LOUIS HOWE IS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL
TO ELEANOR ROOSEVELT'S POLITICAL EDUCATION.
HE MONITORS HER EVERY WORD.
HE ATTENDS ALL OF THE SPEECHES THAT SHE GIVES.
AND HE TELLS HER, "YOU SAID THIS RIGHT, YOU SAID THAT WRONG.
"YOU GIGGLED HERE;
WHY DID YOU GIGGLE HERE?
"YOUR VOICE WENT UP TEN DECIBELS HERE.
WHY DID IT DO THAT?"
HE'S REALLY HER COACH.
Curtis Roosevelt:
AND SHE VERY QUICKLY, IN TWO OR THREE YEARS,
MOVED TO THE TOP IN THE WOMEN'S DIVISION
IN THE NEW YORK STATE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
SHE COULD GET UP AND TALK ON PRETTY MUCH ANY SUBJECT
AND WITH SOME EASE.
SHE TALKED INFORMALLY.
SHE RAN A VERY GOOD MEETING.
McCullough:
ELEANOR DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD ORGANIZING SKILLS,
A TALENT FOR DEALING WITH PEOPLE...
AND SOON FOUND HERSELF
IN THE THICK OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY POLITICS.
PUBLICLY, SHE SPOKE IN FRANKLIN'S NAME.
PRIVATELY, SHE WAS DEVELOPING HER OWN IDEAS.
Cook:
PEOPLE GO TO HER FOR ADVICE.
PEOPLE GO TO HER TO RAISE MONEY.
PEOPLE GO TO HER AND ASK HER TO SPEAK.
SHE SAYS IN HER MEMOIR SHE'S DONE IT ALL FOR F.D.R.,
BUT THE FACT IS SHE LOVES EVERY MINUTE OF IT.
Curtis Roosevelt:
I THINK SHE WAS PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED
AND BELIEVED IN HER HEART
THAT HELPING OTHER PEOPLE, ENABLING OTHER PEOPLE,
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU WERE IN A POSITION OF PRIVILEGE,
WAS THE WAY SHE WISHED TO CONDUCT HER LIFE.
McCullough:
ELEANOR WAS MAKING
ALL THE GREAT REFORM CAUSES OF THE DAY HER OWN:
CHILD LABOR, PUBLIC HOUSING, WORKER'S COMPENSATION,
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.
SHE WAS BECOMING A VOICE FOR THOSE WHO HAD NONE.
Gurewitsch:
SHE HAD ABDICATED HER ROLE AS WIFE.
SHE HAD-
- HE INVITED HER VERY MANY TIMES TO COME DOWN,
BUT HE WAS WITH THE FRIENDS WHOM SHE DIDN'T SPECIALLY CARE FOR--
THE CONGENIAL FRIENDS,
THE FRIENDS FROM THE LUCY MERCER DAYS,
THE...
THE PEOPLE WHO LIKED TO LIVE ON A HOUSEBOAT
AND SWIM AND DRINK AND...
AND HE WAS WITH MISSY LeHAND.
McCullough:
"MISSY" WAS MARGUERITE LeHAND, FRANKLIN'S SECRETARY--
UNMARRIED, CATHOLIC, HIGH-SCHOOL EDUCATED, MANY YEARS YOUNGER.
Goodwin:
MISSY HAD STARTED WORKING FOR FRANKLIN
WHEN SHE WAS 20 YEARS OLD IN 1920
AND, I THINK, FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
AND NEVER STOPPED LOVING HIM ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE.
IT WOULD BE MISSY WHO WOULD SIT BY HIS SIDE
AS THEY WENT FISHING.
SHE LEARNED EVERY ACTIVITY THAT HE LIKED
AND BECAME AN EXPERT AT IT.
SO SHE WAS THE PERFECT COMPANION FOR THESE LAZY, AIMLESS DAYS
ON THE LAROOCO.
ELEANOR IS NOWHERE IN SIGHT DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME.
McCullough:
ELEANOR HAD NOW MADE A LIFE OF HER OWN
WITH HER OWN FRIENDS.
"ALAS AND LACKADAY," WROTE HER AUNT.
"I JUST HATE TO HAVE ELEANOR LET HERSELF LOOK AS SHE DOES.
"SINCE POLITICS HAVE BECOME HER CHOICEST INTEREST,
ALL HER CHARM HAS DISAPPEARED."
FRANKLIN SUPPORTED ELEANOR'S NEW-FOUND INDEPENDENCE.
DURING THE 1920s, THEY HAD ONCE AGAIN REDEFINED THEIR MARRIAGE.
THEY WERE BOUND TOGETHER
BY POLITICS, RESPECT AND REAL AFFECTION,
BUT THEY LED SEPARATE LIVES.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, ELEANOR HAD A HOME OF HER OWN
TWO MILES FROM HYDE PARK--
A SIMPLE COTTAGE, BUILT FOR HER BY FRANKLIN.
SHE CALLED IT VAL-KILL, AFTER THE BROOK RUNNING PAST ITS DOOR.
Cook:
SHE CAN INVITE WHO SHE WANTS THERE.
HER MOTHER-IN-LAW HAS TO KNOCK BEFORE SHE ENTERS.
THERE ARE NO SLIDING DOORS.
SARA IS SHOCKED THAT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WOULD PREFER
TO LIVE IN WHAT SHE CALLS "THAT HOVEL"
RATHER THAN THE PROPER HOUSE--
THE BIG HOUSE WITH THE PROPER NUMBER OF SERVANTS.
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT'S VERY HAPPY AT VAL-KILL.
McCullough:
AT VAL-KILL, ELEANOR FELT FREE.
SHE DEFIED CONVENTION,
BEFRIENDING SO-CALLED NEW WOMEN WHO LIVED WITH ONE ANOTHER.
ELEANOR FOUND IN THESE FRIENDS THE KIND OF EMOTIONAL CLOSENESS
THAT FRANKLIN COULD NOT PROVIDE.
ALL THROUGH THE 1920s ELEANOR FLOURISHED.
SHE BECAME FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT,
WRITING ARTICLES FOR NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES.
SHE TAUGHT AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN NEW YORK, WHICH SHE CO-OWNED.
SHE CONTINUED TO CAMPAIGN FOR PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL CAUSES.
SHE TRAVELED WIDELY.
SHE WAS AT EASE WITH HERSELF
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, BEGAN TO HAVE FUN.
VAL-KILL WAS ELEANOR'S, BUT THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE,
FRANKLIN WAS A FREQUENT AND WELCOME GUEST.
ELEANOR'S FRIENDS BECAME HIS FRIENDS,
SUPPORTING HIS HOPES TO ONE DAY RETURN TO POLITICAL LIFE.
"I DON'T WANT HIM FORGOTTEN," ELEANOR SAID.
"I WANT HIM TO HAVE A VOICE."
McCullough:
IN 1924, THE FORMER CANDIDATE FOR VICE-PRESIDENT
WAS INVITED TO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION.
HE DELIVERED A ROUSING SPEECH,
BUT HE PLAYED NO FURTHER PART IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
HE WAS STILL FAR TOO WEAK.
THAT FALL, THERE WAS TALK OF FRANKLIN RUNNING
FOR GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, BUT HE QUICKLY REJECTED THE IDEA.
HE WOULD NOT SEEK PUBLIC OFFICE, HE SAID,
UNTIL HE NO LONGER NEEDED CRUTCHES.
DETERMINED TO FIND A CURE, HE ONCE AGAIN HEADED SOUTH.
HE HAD HEARD OF POOLS OF STEAMING MINERAL WATER
IN WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA, WHOSE MARVELOUS HEALING POWERS
WERE THE STUFF OF LOCAL LEGEND.
GUSHING OUT OF THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN,
THE WATERS WERE 90 DEGREES AND ASTONISHINGLY BUOYANT.
SOME CALLED THEM "MIRACLE" WATERS.
ALTHOUGH THE WATERS WOULD NEVER GIVE FRANKLIN BACK HIS LEGS,
THEY WOULD GIVE NEW MEANING TO HIS LIFE, AND NEW PURPOSE.
"I FEEL," HE WROTE HIS MOTHER,
"THAT A GREAT CURE FOR INFANTILE PARALYSIS AND KINDRED DISEASES
COULD WELL BE ESTABLISHED HERE."
Man:
WELL, THERE WASN'T MUCH HERE.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE HOTEL DOWNTOWN, YOU KNOW,
AND A GROCERY STORE.
THEY CALLED IT "BULLOCHVILLE."
IT WASN'T CONSIDERED A TOWN-- WHAT I WOULD CALL A TOWN.
I THOUGHT IT TOOK A LOT OF STORES
TO MAKE A TOWN BACK IN THOSE DAYS,
BUT I JUST CALLED IT A GREASY SPOT.
AND I THINK THEY NAMED IT WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA,
AFTER MR. ROOSEVELT, ABOUT THE TIME HE BEGAN TO COME HERE.
McCullough:
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN,
THERE STOOD A ONCE LOVELY VACATION RESORT,
A FAVORED RETREAT FOR WEALTHY SOUTHERNERS.
BY THE TIME FRANKLIN ARRIVED, ITS GLORY HAD FADED
TO A CLUSTER OF COTTAGES IN NEED OF REPAIR, AND A RUN-DOWN HOTEL.
FRANKLIN DREAMED OF RESTORING ITS ORIGINAL CHARM
AND TURNING IT INTO A MODERN REHABILITATION CENTER
FOR THOSE WITH INFANTILE PARALYSIS,
BUT FIRST HE WOULD NEED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.
ROOSEVELT BORROWED A LOT OF MONEY FROM HIS MOTHER
AND PUT IN A LOT OF HIS OWN.
HIS WIFE WAS ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED
AND THOUGHT IT WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO COST TOO MUCH MONEY.
SHE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD GIVE HIM SOMETHING ELSE TO ATTEND TO
AND TAKE HIM AWAY FROM POLITICS, THAT YOU COULDN'T DO EVERYTHING
AND WARM SPRINGS WAS GOING TO COMPLETELY DOMINATE HIS LIFE.
SHE WORRIED ABOUT IT.
ONE OF THE FEW TIMES WE KNOW IN WHICH HE REALLY GOT ANGRY AT HER
WAS WHEN SHE GENTLY SUGGESTED
THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA, AND HE WAS FURIOUS.
HE REALLY EXPLODED AND SAID,
"THIS IS SOMETHING I REALLY WANT.
YOU EITHER SUPPORT ME OR YOU DON'T."
AND THEN WHEN THAT WAS SORT OF A...
SORT OF AN EMOTIONAL ULTIMATUM, SHE DID SUPPORT IT.
McCullough:
INVESTING $195,000--
TWO-THIRDS OF HIS PERSONAL FORTUNE--
FRANKLIN CREATED AND DESIGNED
THE FIRST MODERN TREATMENT CENTER FOR INFANTILE PARALYSIS
IN THE COUNTRY.
SOON PEOPLE WITH POLIO FROM ACROSS AMERICA
WERE MAKING THE PILGRIMAGE TO THE GEORGIA BACKWOODS.
AS FRANKLIN STRUGGLED
TO REHABILITATE HIS OWN WITHERED LIMBS,
HE DEVOTED HIMSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME TO HELPING OTHERS.
(shrieking and laughing)
"YOU WOULD HOWL WITH GLEE," HE TOLD A FRIEND,
"IF YOU COULD SEE THE CLINIC IN OPERATION
"AND THE PATIENTS DOING VARIOUS EXERCISES IN THE WATER
UNDER MY LEADERSHIP."
Gallagher:
WARM SPRINGS WAS A WONDERFUL PLACE.
ROOSEVELT WAS A PATIENT JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.
"DOCTOR" ROOSEVELT, AS THE OTHERS CALLED HIM,
WAS REALLY REMARKABLY CREATIVE.
HE BROUGHT IN BLACKSMITHS
AND THEY DESIGNED BRACES AND CRUTCHES--
A CRUTCH DESIGN THAT'S STILL USED,
THE WARM SPRINGS CRUTCH.
ROOSEVELT INVENTED A MUSCLE TESTING TECHNIQUE,
A WAY OF GRADING HOW STRONG A MUSCLE IS
THAT IS STILL IN USE,
AND IT WAS A REMARKABLY INVENTIVE TIME.
McCullough:
ALWAYS HE BELIEVED IN RECOVERY.
HIS PRESCRIPTION:
SWIMMING, SUNLIGHT AND BELIEF ON THE PATIENT'S PART
THAT THE MUSCLES ARE COMING BACK.
Man:
HE HAD CHARISMA.
HE WAS JUST GLOWING WITH IT,
AND HE'D DO THAT SMILE AND HE'D LAUGH.
(shrieking)
Woman:
AFTER EVERYBODY HAD TREATMENT,
THEY WOULD ALL GO OUT INTO WHAT WAS CALLED THE PLAY POOL
AND THEY WOULD PLAY VIGOROUS GAMES OF BALL.
HE PLAYED WITH THEM,
AND HE WAS JUST AS TOUGH AS ANY OF THE CHILDREN.
THEY LOVED HIM.
Ward:
WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE GOT BETTER AT WARM SPRINGS,
THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE BETTER
AND THEY FELT THAT WITH HIM PRESENT, ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE.
McCullough:
WARM SPRINGS WAS FRANKLIN'S CREATION.
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, IN TIMES OF STRESS,
HE WOULD RETREAT TO THE PINEY WOODS AND THE WARM WATERS.
IT BECAME HIS SECOND HOME.
(no voice)
FRANKLIN LOVED TO DRIVE...
AND HE DROVE FAST.
HE DESIGNED HIS CAR HIMSELF
WITH INGENIOUS LEVERS AND PULLEYS
SO HE COULD DRIVE WITHOUT HIS LEGS.
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE WAS PARALYZED, HE FELT FREE.
OVER THE YEARS, HIS DRIVES THROUGH THE GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE
WOULD PROVIDE HIM WITH A VALUABLE POLITICAL EDUCATION.
Man:
HE WAS INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE
AND HE GOT OUT AND VISITED WITH THEM.
EVEN AFTER HE WAS PRESIDENT,
HE WOULD SLIP AWAY FROM HIS BODYGUARDS AND GET OUT
AND RIDE THE BACK WAYS AND BACK ROADS AND MEET PEOPLE
AND STOP AND TALK WITH THEM.
BUT HE'D NEVER MET PEOPLE LIKE THAT BEFORE.
Loftin:
HE USUALLY TALKED TO YOU.
HE STARTED THE CONVERSATION.
AND WHATEVER HE WANTED TO KNOW, HE'D ASK.
HE DIDN'T HESITATE ABOUT ASKING
IF HE SAW SOMETHING HE WANTED TO KNOW.
McCullough:
EVERYWHERE HE WENT, HE HEARD STORIES
ABOUT THE LACK OF ELECTRICITY IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
AND THE EXORBITANT RATES PAID FOR IT IN TOWN...
ABOUT BAD SCHOOLS AND LOW FARM PRICES--
STORIES THAT LEFT THEIR MARK ON HIM.
Copeland:
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW COME I LOVED HIM LIKE I DID.
IT WASN'T...
HE HADN'T DONE ANYTHING FOR ME PERSONALLY.
WE WOULD WALK TO WARM SPRINGS
JUST TO SEE HIM DISBOARD THE TRAIN.
HE'D COME ON DOWN TO...
"HELLO, WARM SPRINGS, HELLO, WARM SPRINGS."
THAT'S THE WAY...
WE WANTED TO SEE HIM GREET THE LITTLE TOWN,
AND WE WALKED FOR MILES TO SEE THAT.
WELL, HE WASN'T THE PRESIDENT THEN.
HE WASN'T EVEN THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, I DON'T GUESS.
BUT HE WAS JUST MR. ROOSEVELT IN THOSE DAYS.
AFTER HE BECAME PRESIDENT, THEY WERE VERY, YOU KNOW, POLITE.
BUT THEY USED TO CALL HIM IN THE EARLY DAYS "ROSEY,"
WHICH I THINK WAS A WONDERFUL NAME.
EVERYBODY LOVED HIM.
IT GOES BEYOND LIKE;
THEY LOVED HIM.
Eleanor Roosevelt:
I DON'T THINK HE CHANGED COMPLETELY.
THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE ALWAYS THERE.
BUT HE CERTAINLY LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SUFFERING MEANT
IN A WAY THAT HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE...
BECAUSE HE COULD UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE COULD SUFFER
IN WAYS THAT HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED,
AND I THINK THAT GREW OUT OF HIS POLIO EXPERIENCE.
AND HE CERTAINLY GAINED ENORMOUSLY IN PATIENCE.
THAT GAVE HIM SOME OF THE PATIENCE THAT WAS NEEDED
TO MEET THE PROBLEMS BOTH OF THE NEW DEAL AND THE WAR.
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY TO HIM,
"BUT IF WE DO THIS, WE DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL."
AND I'VE SEEN MY HUSBAND TIME AFTER TIME SAY,
"THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS WE CAN KNOW BEFOREHAND.
"WE WILL TRY, AND IF WE FIND WE ARE WRONG,
WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE."
McCullough:
THROUGHOUT HIS LONG STRUGGLE WITH POLIO,
FRANKLIN REMAINED DETERMINED TO RETURN TO POLITICS.
BUT HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO CONVINCE VOTERS
THAT HE WAS NOT AN INVALID,
AND YEAR AFTER YEAR OF ARDUOUS EXERCISE
HAD NOT IMPROVED HIS WASTED LEG MUSCLES.
Gallagher:
HE WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT,
AND IT WAS JUST UNTHINKABLE IN THOSE DAYS
THAT A PERSON IN A WHEELCHAIR
COULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--
AND IN FACT IT'S PRETTY UNTHINKABLE RIGHT NOW--
AND SO HE HAD TO WALK,
AND SINCE HE WASN'T GETTING BETTER,
HE DEVELOPED BETTER TECHNIQUES FOR APPEARING TO LOOK BETTER.
McCullough:
IN 1926, PHYSIOTHERAPIST ALICE CONVERSE
TAUGHT FRANKLIN HOW TO WALK MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH CRUTCHES.
Converse:
HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO WALK.
HE WOULD PLANT THE CRUTCHES ON THE FLOOR SO HARD,
YOU'D THINK THAT THE BOARDS WOULD BREAK
AND THEN DRAG HIMSELF ALONG.
IT HAD BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE THE ONSET OF POLIO.
HIS UPPER BODY WAS VERY STRONG BUT HIS LEGS WERE PRETTY WEAK,
SO WE TRIED TO GET HIM TO USE HIS BODY MUSCLES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THEY WOULD HELP LIFT UP A LEG AT A TIME AND TAKE A STEP.
McCullough:
BUT CRUTCHES WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
HE KNEW THEY WERE POLITICAL POISON.
THEY WOULD, HE SAID, "INSPIRE PITY."
HE LEARNED INSTEAD TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC WITH A CANE.
Gallagher:
HE DEVELOPED THIS TECHNIQUE
THAT LOOKED LIKE WALKING...
HIS SONS WERE STRONG MEN.
THEY TOOK EXERCISES
SO THEIR ARMS WOULD BE AS STRONG AS A PARALLEL BAR,
AND HE WOULD LEAN ON ONE SON'S ARM,
PUTTING ALL HIS WEIGHT ON IT,
AND THEN HE WOULD SWITCH HIS WEIGHT FROM THE SON'S ARM
ONTO A CANE, WHICH HE CARRIED IN THE OTHER HAND,
SO THAT HE COULD SWITCH HIS WEIGHT FROM SIDE TO SIDE
AND THUS PROGRESS,
AND HE INSTRUCTED HIS SONS,
"YOU MUST NOT LET PEOPLE SEE THAT THIS IS DIFFICULT
OR TAKES EFFORT OR HURTS."
THEY WOULD CHAT AND JOKE AND LAUGH AS THEY WENT ALONG.
IT WAS A SLOW PROCESS,
BUT THEY LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WERE TAKING THEIR TIME
SO THEY COULD SMILE AT PEOPLE
AND SAY HELLO TO THE CROWD AS THEY WENT ALONG.
AND IT WAS SHOW BIZ, BUT IT WORKED.
McCullough:
ONLY FOUR SECONDS OF FILM EXIST WHICH CLEARLY SHOW
THE WALK FRANKLIN SO TIRELESSLY PRACTICED.
Ward:
THE GOAL REALLY WAS SIMPLY TO TAKE ENOUGH STEPS
TO GET FROM A CAR INTO A BUILDING
OR FROM HIS SEAT ON THE STAGE TO THE PODIUM AND BACK AGAIN.
IF HE COULD DO THAT WITHOUT SEEMING HOPELESSLY CRIPPLED,
HE'D SUCCEEDED.
Gallagher:
ROOSEVELT HAD NO HIP MUSCLES,
AND IF A BREEZE, SOMEONE SHOULD JOSTLE HIM, SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
HE COULD JUST PIVOT AND FALL DOWN.
HE WAS NOT STABLE AT ALL.
IT WAS NOT A SAFE WAY OF LOCOMOTION, OF MOVING AROUND,
AND NOT A PRACTICAL WAY, BUT IT WAS A POLITICAL WAY.
McCullough:
BY THE SUMMER OF 1928, FRANKLIN WAS READY AT LAST
TO MAKE HIS WAY BACK INTO THE POLITICAL WORLD.
THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION WAS IN HOUSTON,
AND ELEANOR HAD WRITTEN HIM, "I'M TELLING EVERYONE
YOU'RE GOING TO HOUSTON WITHOUT CRUTCHES."
AS HE BOARDED THE TRAIN FOR TEXAS,
HE KNEW HE WAS ABOUT TO RISK EVERYTHING.
ALL THROUGH THE 1920s, FRANKLIN HAD KEPT UP HIS CONTACTS
WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS.
NOW HE'D BEEN ASKED TO NOMINATE
THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK-- AL SMITH-
- FOR PRESIDENT.
SMITH WAS A TOUGH, WORLDLY CATHOLIC FROM NEW YORK CITY
AND ONE OF HIS ADVISERS ARGUED,
"YOU'RE A BOWERY MICK AND HE'S A PROTESTANT PATRICIAN.
HE'LL TAKE SOME OF THE CURSE OFF YOU."
WITH 15,000 DELEGATES WATCHING,
FRANKLIN SET OUT TO WALK TO THE PODIUM WITH A CANE,
WITHOUT THE AID OF CRUTCHES.
AN ACCIDENTAL FALL WOULD LEAVE HIM SPRAWLED HELPLESSLY
ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR, HIS POLITICAL HOPES DESTROYED.
WITH ONE HAND HE GRIPPED THE CANE.
WITH THE OTHER HE BALANCED PRECARIOUSLY
ON HIS SON ELLIOTT'S POWERFUL ARM.
HE APPEARED TO BE WALKING.
ONE REPORTER DESCRIBED THE SCENE:
"HERE ON THE STAGE IS FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT--
"A FIGURE TALL AND PROUD EVEN IN SUFFERING,
"PALE WITH YEARS OF STRUGGLE AGAINST PARALYSIS,
"A MAN SOFTENED AND CLEANSED AND ILLUMINED WITH PAIN.
FOR THE MOMENT, WE ARE LIFTED UP."
Franklin Roosevelt:
WE OFFER ONE WHO HAS THE WILL TO WIN,
WHO NOT ONLY DESERVES SUCCESS, BUT COMMANDS IT.
VICTORY IS HIS HABIT.
THE HAPPY WARRIOR, ALFRED E. SMITH.
(wild cheering)
McCullough:
THE NOMINATION WAS AL SMITH'S,
BUT THE VICTORY BELONGED TO FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
WHEN SMITH URGED HIM TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK,
ROOSEVELT SAID HE WAS READY.
SOMEONE ASKED SMITH WHY HE HAD PUT ROOSEVELT
BACK IN THE POLITICAL LIMELIGHT.
"AREN'T YOU RAISING UP A RIVAL
WHO WILL ONE DAY CAUSE YOU TROUBLE?"
"NO," SMITH REPLIED.
"HE'LL BE DEAD WITHIN A YEAR."
SIX MONTHS LATER, SMITH HAD LOST HIS RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY
AND ROOSEVELT WAS GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.
ROOSEVELT WON OFFICE BY THE SLIMMEST OF MARGINS,
CAMPAIGNING MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN ANYONE EXPECTED.
NOW AS GOVERNOR, HE WOULD CONTINUE TO SURPRISE EVERYONE.
HE TOOK COMMAND AT ONCE.
IN HIS FIRST SIX MONTHS, HE ADVOCATED TAX RELIEF FOR FARMERS
AND CHEAP ELECTRIC POWER FOR CONSUMERS.
BUT WHEN DISASTER SUDDENLY STRUCK THE ECONOMY,
NO ONE WAS SURE WHAT ROOSEVELT WOULD DO.
ON OCTOBER 24, 1929, THE STOCK MARKET CRASHED.
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE WORST CALAMITY
THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY HAD EVER KNOWN.
BANKS CLOSED, MILLIONS WERE PUT OUT OF WORK.
HOMELESS PEOPLE WERE SOON CAMPING JUST A FEW BLOCKS
FROM THE TOWN HOUSE SARA ROOSEVELT HAD BUILT
FOR FRANKLIN AND HIS BRIDE YEARS BEFORE.
ELEANOR GAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE COOK
TO PROVIDE ANYONE WHO CAME TO THE DOOR
WITH HOT COFFEE AND SANDWICHES.
Man:
THERE'S ONLY ONE WORD THAT ADEQUATELY DESCRIBES IT,
AND THAT'S SURELY DESPAIR-- A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS,
A SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS.
ABOUT A THIRD--
IMAGINE A THIRD OF LABOR TOTALLY UNEMPLOYED.
14 MILLION PEOPLE.
THERE WAS A SENSE OF FRIGHT-- A SENSE OF HORROR.
IT WAS A FEELING THAT, WHAT WAS HAPPENING?
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD OCCUR
IN THE COUNTRY?
McCullough:
SINCE THE START OF THE DEPRESSION,
THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, HERBERT HOOVER,
HAD SETTLED INTO A DISMAL PESSIMISM.
AFTER ONE GLOOMY WHITE HOUSE MEETING,
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE SAID,
"IT WAS LIKE SITTING IN A BATH OF INK TO SIT IN HIS ROOM."
HOOVER BELIEVED THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO
TO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND;
THE CRISIS WOULD HAVE TO RESOLVE ITSELF
WITHOUT THE AID OF GOVERNMENT.
AT FIRST, ROOSEVELT AGREED WITH HOOVER.
"INDUSTRIAL AND TRADE CONDITIONS ARE SOUND," HE WIRED A NEWSPAPER
THE MORNING AFTER THE CRASH.
BUT AS THE CRISIS DEEPENED, ROOSEVELT BEGAN TO CHANGE.
ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD BELIEVED
THAT RELIEF SHOULD COME FROM PRIVATE CHARITIES,
BUT FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE DEPRESSION,
HE BECAME CONVINCED
THAT ONLY MASSIVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION COULD HELP.
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
ROOSEVELT BEGAN TO EXPERIMENT WITH BOLD NEW IDEAS--
ASSISTANCE FOR THE AGED, AND THE COUNTRY'S FIRST PROGRAM
TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THE UNEMPLOYED.
"THE IMPORTANT THING," HE TOLD THE NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY,
"IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A DUTY ON THE PART OF GOVERNMENT
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS."
IN 1932, PRESIDENT HOOVER INVITED THE NATION'S GOVERNORS
TO A WHITE HOUSE DINNER.
WITH HIS PRESIDENCY IN JEOPARDY,
HE WANTED TO SIZE UP THE MAN FROM NEW YORK
WITH THE PROGRESSIVE PROGRAMS
WHO WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER.
Man:
AND THE NIGHT OF THE DINNER, WITH A CANE IN HIS HAND,
HE STARTED GOING TO THE DINING ROOM,
DRAGGING HIS LEGS FROM HIS HIPS
AND SUPPORTING HIMSELF FROM THE CANE AND HIS BODYGUARD'S ARM.
AND HE WALKED TO THE ANGLE, THAT 45-DEGREE ANGLE OF THE TABLE,
AND I WAS ALERTED TO A NOD
THAT WAS TELLING ME HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE SEAT.
WELL, WHEN HE DID, HE LITERALLY FELL IN THE SEAT,
AND THAT SCENE WAS WITNESSED
BY ALL THE GUESTS AT THE DINNER TABLE.
AND EVERYBODY SAID, "WELL, THAT MAN, WHAT IS HE THINKING ABOUT?
"HOW'S HE GOING TO BE PRESIDENT?
HE'S ONLY A HALF MAN."
McCullough:
ON JULY 1, 1932, AFTER FIVE TENSION-FILLED DAYS
AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION,
THE DELEGATES RALLIED BEHIND THE MAN
WHO HAD FOUGHT HIS WAY BACK FROM DESPAIR.
Man:
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT--
HAVING RECEIVED MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS
OF ALL THE DELEGATES VOTING,
I PROCLAIM HIM THE NOMINEE OF THIS CONVENTION
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
(cheering)
McCullough:
NOW F.D.R. WAS READY TO BEGIN THE RACE
HE HAD BEEN PREPARING FOR ALL HIS LIFE.
Franklin Roosevelt:
THIS IS MORE THAN A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.
IT IS A CALL TO ARMS.
GIVE ME YOUR HELP,
NOT TO WIN VOTES ALONE, BUT TO WIN IN THIS CRUSADE
TO RESTORE AMERICA TO ITS OWN PEOPLE.
(cheering)
McCullough:
HE REFUSED TO LET HIS CRIPPLED LEGS
KEEP HIM FROM RUNNING HARD AND WITH CONFIDENCE.
I USED TO SAY, "IF I GO TO WASHINGTON
ON THE FOURTH OF MARCH NEXT."
BUT NOW AT THE...
VERY NEARLY THE END OF THIS SWING,
I'M NOT SAYING "IF," I'M SAYING "WHEN."
THE GREAT WAR AGAINST DEPRESSION
IS BEING FOUGHT ON MANY FRONTS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD.
McCullough:
HIS REPUBLICAN OPPONENT,
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
APPEARED OVERWHELMED BY THE DEPRESSION.
...THE LAST 18 MONTHS TO CARRY OUR FINANCIAL STRUCTURES SAFELY
THROUGH THE WORLDWIDE COLLAPSE...
McCullough:
ONE OBSERVER REMARKED,
"IF YOU PUT A ROSE IN HOOVER'S HAND, IT WOULD WILT."
Man:
HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
THAT HE WAS JUST OUT OF CONTROL.
AND ROOSEVELT GAVE THE IMPRESSION
THAT HE KNEW WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDED
AND HE WAS GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM.
WE FACE THAT CRISIS.
WE FACE IT WITH SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE
AND, ABOVE ALL, WITH FAITH.
KEEP THAT FAITH CONSTANT.
KEEP THAT FAITH HIGH.
SO SHALL WE WIN THROUGH TO A BETTER DAY.
(cheering)
McCullough:
IN SPITE OF THE CRISIS THE COUNTRY FACED,
IT WAS A CAMPAIGN OF PERSONALITIES.
AMERICANS WANTED A LEADER,
AND PEOPLE EVERYWHERE WARMED TO THE BIG SMILE,
THE CONFIDENT TOSS OF THE HEAD, THE CLEAR DELIGHT IN PEOPLE.
McCullough:
WHEN IT WAS OVER,
ROOSEVELT HAD WON A SMASHING VICTORY.
(cheering)
Man:
BY MIDNIGHT, THE COUNTRY ALREADY KNEW
THAT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WAS THE WINNER, AND A VERY LARGE WINNER.
ONE MAN SENT HERBERT HOOVER A WIRE SAYING,
"VOTE FOR ROOSEVELT AND MAKE IT UNANIMOUS."
LET ME THANK YOU AGAIN
AND TELL YOU THAT I HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL VERY SOON
AND BID YOU AN AFFECTIONATE GOOD NIGHT.
McCullough:
"I WAS HAPPY FOR MY HUSBAND," ELEANOR LATER WROTE.
"I KNEW THAT IT WOULD MAKE UP
"FOR THE BLOW THAT FATE HAD DEALT HIM WHEN HE WAS STRICKEN
"WITH INFANTILE PARALYSIS.
"BUT FOR MYSELF, I WAS DEEPLY TROUBLED.
"THIS MEANT THE END OF ANY PERSONAL LIFE OF MY OWN.
THE TURMOIL IN MY HEART AND MIND WAS RATHER GREAT THAT NIGHT."
McCullough:
IT WOULD BE FOUR MONTHS
BEFORE ROOSEVELT WOULD TAKE OFFICE,
THE WORST MONTHS YET OF THE DEPRESSION.
5,000 BANKS CLOSED.
EACH MONTH 20,000 FARMERS LOST THEIR LAND.
THE ECONOMY HAD COLLAPSED.
AMERICANS EVERYWHERE WAITED FOR THE PRESIDENT-ELECT
TO TELL THEM WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO,
BUT ROOSEVELT GAVE NO CLUES.
Leuchtenburg:
AT ONE POINT, REPORTERS ASK HIM A QUESTION
AND HE SIMPLY HOLDS UP HIS FINGER AND GOES "SHH."
HE WILL NOT BE DRAWN OUT.
McCullough:
ONE MONTH BEFORE THE INAUGURATION,
ROOSEVELT WENT CRUISING IN THE CARIBBEAN
WITH HIS WEALTHY FRIENDS ON VINCENT ASTOR'S YACHT--
THE BIGGEST AND FASTEST OCEAN-GOING MOTOR YACHT
EVER BUILT.
DURING THE CAMPAIGN,
HE HAD PROMISED WHAT HE CALLED A NEW DEAL
FOR THE FORGOTTEN MAN.
BUT AS YET HE HAD SAID NOTHING
ABOUT WHAT THAT NEW DEAL MIGHT BE.
MEANWHILE, ELEANOR WAS EXPECTED TO GIVE UP
HER TEACHING AND WRITING TO BECOME THE NATION'S FIRST LADY.
TO GET TOGETHER AS YOU ARE HERE
AND FORGET THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A DEPRESSION FOR A TIME
AND FORGET ALL THE TROUBLES THAT WEIGH US DOWN
AND SIMPLY SING IS A GRAND THING TO DO.
Crowd:
♫THERE'S A LONG, LONG TRAIL WINDING♫
♫INTO THE LAND OF MY DREAMS♫
♫AND THE NIGHTINGALES ARE SINGING♫
♫AND A WHITE MOON BEAMS...♫
McCullough:
ON MARCH 2, 1933, WITH THE ROOSEVELTS ON BOARD,
THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO TRAIN HEADED TOWARD WASHINGTON.
IN TWO DAYS, FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WOULD BECOME
THE 32nd PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
ELEANOR SAT QUIETLY BY HERSELF.
SHE FEARED SHE WAS ABOUT TO LOSE HER HARD-WON INDEPENDENCE.
"I NEVER WANTED TO BE A PRESIDENT'S WIFE," SHE SAID,
"AND I DON'T WANT IT NOW."
THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S MOTHER, SARA,
WAS, AS ALWAYS, CONFIDENT IN HER BOY.
"I AM NOT IN THE LEAST WORRIED ABOUT FRANKLIN,"
SHE TOLD A FRIEND.
IN THE LAST CAR, FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SAT ALONE.
"IN ALL THE YEARS I KNEW HIM," HIS SON JAMES WROTE,
"THERE WAS ONLY ONE TIME
"WHEN FATHER WORRIED ABOUT HIS ABILITY.
IT WAS THE NIGHT HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT."
"YOU KNOW, JIMMY," HE SAID TO ME,
"ALL MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF ONLY ONE THING:
FIRE.
TONIGHT I THINK I'M AFRAID OF SOMETHING ELSE."
"AFRAID OF WHAT, FATHER?" I ASKED.
"I'M AFRAID THAT I MAY NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO THE JOB."
(cheering)
ON MARCH 4, 1933, A MAN WHO COULD NOT WALK
WOULD BEGIN TO LEAD A CRIPPLED COUNTRY.
Franklin Roosevelt:
I, FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT,
DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND WILL TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES,
SO HELP ME GOD.
Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org
McCullough:
"IN ALL THE YEARS I KNEW HIM,"
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S ELDEST SON REMEMBERED,
"THERE WAS ONLY ONE TIME
"WHEN MY FATHER WORRIED ABOUT HIS ABILITY.
IT WAS THE NIGHT HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT."
McCullough:
ON MARCH 2, 1933,
AS A BALTIMORE AND OHIO TRAIN SPED FROM HYDE PARK, NEW YORK,
TOWARD WASHINGTON,
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT SAT ALL ALONE IN THE LAST CAR.
IN TWO DAYS, THIS MAN WITH THE LEGS CRIPPLED BY POLIO,
WHOSE GREATEST STRENGTH SEEMED TO BE HIS CHARM,
WOULD BECOME THE 32nd PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
OVER 70 YEARS BEFORE,
ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD TRAVELED BY TRAIN TO HIS INAUGURATION
TO LEAD A COUNTRY ABOUT TO BE TORN APART.
NOW ROOSEVELT WOULD HAVE TO FACE
THE NATION'S GRAVEST CRISIS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.
14 MILLION AMERICANS WERE OUT OF WORK.
NINE MILLION HAD LOST THEIR LIFE SAVINGS.
THE ECONOMY HAD COLLAPSED.
Man:
PEOPLE WERE DOWN AND OUT IN THEIR FEELINGS--
NOT ONLY IN THEIR STOMACHS AND IN THEIR POCKETBOOKS.
IT WAS A TREMENDOUSLY DEPRESSING PERIOD OF TIME.
THERE WERE NOT A FEW PEOPLE WHO REALLY SAW
THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE COUNTRY WAS GOING TO DISINTEGRATE.
McCullough:
THE TRAIN CLATTERED THROUGH NEW JERSEY,
WHERE NEWARK HAD DEFAULTED ON ITS PAYROLL,
AND ROLLED ON THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND MARYLAND,
WHERE THE BANKS WERE CLOSED.
HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IOWA FARMERS THREATENED
TO HANG A LAWYER FORECLOSING ON THEIR FARMS.
AND IN DETROIT, MEN WHO HAD LOST THEIR JOBS
WERE STEALING FOOD FROM GROCERY STORES.
(train whistle blows)
AS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S TRAIN
PULLED INTO WASHINGTON'S UNION STATION,
NO ONE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
FROM THIS MAN WHO HAD PROMISED A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICANS.
Man:
THE COUNTRY WAS IN A HELL OF A MESS
AND EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING TO THIS NEW MAN
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.
HIS PROMISES HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE LOT,
BUT ACTION, ACTION, ACTION WAS WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.
McCullough:
"IF THE NEW DEAL IS A SUCCESS,"
A FRIEND TOLD ROOSEVELT,
"YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE GREATEST AMERICAN PRESIDENT."
"IF I FAIL," ROOSEVELT REPLIED,
"I WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE LAST ONE."

INAUGURATION DAY BEGAN
WITH A SERVICE AT ST.
JOHN'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH
WITH HYMNS SELECTED BY ROOSEVELT HIMSELF.
(verse concludes):
♫...
AND OUR ETERNAL HOME.♫
McCullough:
HIS SECRETARY OF LABOR, FRANCES PERKINS,
DESCRIBED THE SCENE:
"WE WERE IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION," SHE WROTE.
"BANKS WERE CLOSING.
"THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE COUNTRY
"WAS ALMOST AT A STANDSTILL.
IF EVER A MAN WANTED TO PRAY, THAT WAS THE DAY."
"HE DID WANT TO PRAY
AND HE WANTED EVERYONE TO PRAY FOR HIM."
Choir:
♫...
AND OUR DEFENSE IS SURE.♫
McCullough:
THE WEATHER WAS COLD AND BLEAK.
GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR HAD PREPARED HIS TROOPS
FOR A POSSIBLE RIOT.
ON HIS LAST MORNING IN OFFICE, PRESIDENT HERBERT HOOVER SAID,
"WE ARE AT THE END OF OUR STRING.
THERE IS NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO."
HOOVER DETESTED ROOSEVELT,
THOUGHT HIM AN OPPORTUNIST
SURE TO DRAG THE COUNTRY EVEN DEEPER INTO DESPAIR.
ON THE RIDE TO THE CAPITOL,
ROOSEVELT TRIED TO MAKE CONVERSATION,
BUT HOOVER SAT STONY-FACED.
"THE TWO OF US SIMPLY COULDN'T SIT THERE ON OUR HANDS,
IGNORING EACH OTHER AND EVERYONE ELSE," ROOSEVELT RECALLED,
"SO I BEGAN WAVING MY TOP HAT, AND I KEPT WAVING IT
UNTIL I GOT TO THE INAUGURATION STAND."
(cheering)
Choir:
♫SUFFICIENT IS THINE ARM ALONE...♫
McCullough:
"IT WAS VERY, VERY SOLEMN,"
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT TOLD REPORTERS LATER, "AND A LITTLE TERRIFYING.
"THE CROWDS WERE SO TREMENDOUS
"AND YOU FELT THAT THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING
IF ONLY SOMEONE WOULD TELL THEM WHAT TO DO."
AS HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE PODIUM,
ROOSEVELT APPEARED TO BE WALKING,
BUT IT HAD TAKEN YEARS OF PRACTICE
TO PERFECT THAT ILLUSION.
IN FACT, HE WAS PRESSING DOWN ON HIS SON'S ARM WITH AN IRON GRIP,
PROPELLING HIMSELF FORWARD WITH THE HELP OF A CANE
AND HIS POWERFUL UPPER BODY.
AMERICANS EVERYWHERE WAITED.
Roosevelt:
I, FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT,
DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR that I will faithfully execute...
Man:
ONE HAS TO IMAGINE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
CLUSTERED AROUND THEIR RADIO SETS
IN TOWNS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT OF THIS NEW PRESIDENT.
HE'S NOT SHOWN THEM MUCH YET,
AND THEN THEY HEAR, COMING THROUGH THEIR LOUDSPEAKERS,
THIS VOICE.
Roosevelt:
This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly...
SO FILLED WITH COURAGE, WITH SELF-CONFIDENCE,
WITH A SENSE OF LEADERSHIP.
THIS GREAT NATION WILL ENDURE AS IT HAS ENDURED,
WILL REVIVE AND WILL PROSPER.
Man:
SUDDENLY THIS MAN CAME IN
AND HE MADE CLEAR TO THE COUNTRY
THAT THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING TO FEAR
EXCEPT THE FEAR THAT WAS IN ONE'S OWN HEART.
LET ME ASSERT MY FIRM BELIEF
THAT THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS fear itself-- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror...
Ginzberg:
THE COUNTRY WAS SO EXCITED THAT ONE HAD A LIVE LEADER
FINALLY, AT LONG LAST, IN THE WHITE HOUSE
THAT HE COULD HAVE SUGGESTED
THAT WE ALL GET READY TO WALK TO THE MOON
AND WE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED HIM.
IT WAS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE CHANGE IN MOOD.
(playing "Stars and Stripes Forever")
Leuchtenburg:
IT HAS AN ELECTRIFYING EFFECT.
NEARLY A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WRITE TO HIM.
THIS IS UNHEARD OF.
AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST GENERATION
HAD GOTTEN AS FEW AS 200 LETTERS IN A WEEK.
NOW NEARLY A HALF A MILLION WRITE TO FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT,
AND OVERNIGHT HE ESTABLISHES HIMSELF
AS THE LEADER THAT THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR.
McCullough:
"DEAR MR. ROOSEVELT:
I AM WRITING TO YOU FOR HELP.
"WE HAVE EIGHT CHILDREN TO TAKE CARE OF
"AND NOBODY WORKING BUT MY HUSBAND.
"HE'S GETTING SUCH LITTLE PAY FOR HIS WORK
"AND WE HAVE A SICK CHILD.
"PLEASE, MR. ROOSEVELT,
"DON'T LET THEM TAKE OUR HOME AWAY FROM US.
PLEASE, SIR."
"DEAR MR. ROOSEVELT:
I HAVE NEVER AS YET BEGGED,
"BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME KIND OF HELP.
"I HAVE ALWAYS PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT AND HAVE WORKED MANY A DAY
UNTIL I WAS ALMOST UNABLE TO STAND UP, BUT ALL TO NO AVAIL."
McCullough:
MARCH 4, 1933, ROOSEVELT'S FIRST DAY IN OFFICE.
WITH THE BANKS CLOSED, INVESTMENT AT A STANDSTILL,
MANY AMERICANS BELIEVED
THAT THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM WAS FAILING.
ONE AIDE WROTE, "WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH A CHOICE
"BETWEEN AN ORDERLY REVOLUTION
OR A VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THE WHOLE CAPITALIST STRUCTURE."
ROOSEVELT COULD HOPE, LIKE HOOVER,
THAT THE ECONOMY WOULD REPAIR ITSELF.
OR HE COULD TRY SOMETHING
THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN AMERICA:
INTERVENE ON A MASSIVE SCALE
WITH THE POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
Man:
I HAD A PROFESSOR
THAT TAUGHT THE COURSE IN BUSINESS CYCLES,
AND I REMEMBER HE REACHED IN HIS POCKET
AND TOOK A RUBBER BAND OUT
AND HE HELD IT AND THEN HE PULLED IT
AND HE SAID, "THIS IS BOOM."
THEN HE LET GO OF ONE END, IT SNAPPED BACK, HE SAID, "BUST."
HE SAYS THIS HAPPENS TO A CAPITALISTIC ECONOMY
AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.
AND ROOSEVELT, OF COURSE, BROUGHT AROUND HIM
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT BUNK
AND THOUGHT YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO TURN IT AROUND.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT'S ADVISERS OFFERED HIM A RANGE OF PROGRAMS.
IN THE END, HE WOULD WORK FROM NO SYSTEMATIC PLAN.
INSTEAD, HE WOULD EXPERIMENT.
Leuchtenburg:
TRY ONE IDEA;
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, WE'LL TRY ANOTHER.
HE LIKENED HIMSELF TO A QUARTERBACK.
YOU TRY A PLAY;
IF THAT PLAY DOESN'T WORK, YOU TURN TO ANOTHER PLAY.
McCullough:
"IT IS COMMON SENSE," ROOSEVELT SAID,
"TO TAKE A METHOD AND TRY IT.
"IF IT FAILS, ADMIT IT FRANKLY AND TRY ANOTHER.
BUT ABOVE ALL, TRY SOMETHING."
IN HIS FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE
ROOSEVELT MANAGED TO PUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
BACK TO WORK.
HE PLEDGED BILLIONS TO SAVE THEIR FARMS
AND THEIR HOMES FROM FORECLOSURE.
HE PROVIDED RELIEF TO THE UNEMPLOYED.
HE RESTORED CONFIDENCE IN THE BANKS
AND GUARANTEED THE SAVINGS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
Roosevelt:
I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT IT IS SAFER FOR YOU TO KEEP YOUR MONEY IN A REOPENED BANK
THAN TO KEEP IT UNDER THE MATTRESS.
Ginsburg:
HIS KEY WAS SOMEHOW TO PROP UP CAPITALISM.
THAT WAS UNQUESTIONABLY IN BACK OF HIS MIND.
BUT HE WAS A PRAGMATIST.
HE WAS SEEKING TO FIND SOLUTIONS
TO THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS THAT BESET PEOPLE TODAY.
THE BANKS WERE CLOSED.
GET THE BANKS OPEN.
McCullough:
AND TO SELL THE CENTERPIECE OF HIS PROGRAM--
THE NATIONAL RECOVERY ADMINISTRATION--
HE ORCHESTRATED AN EXTRAORDINARY PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN.
THE N.R.A. WAS DESIGNED TO TAME
THE UNRULY CYCLES OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM
BY ENCOURAGING BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT TO WORK TOGETHER.
EACH INDUSTRY WAS ALLOWED TO SET ITS OWN WAGES AND PRICES.
LABOR WAS PROMISED THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY.
Man:
I WENT TO THE TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
ON A DAY IN, I THINK, JUNE 1933.
THERE WAS THIS ENORMOUS NATIONAL RECOVERY ACT PARADE, YOU KNOW,
AND THEY HAD THIS SYMBOL, THE BLUE EAGLE, EVERYWHERE.
IT WAS ON CIGARETTE PACKAGES, AND IT WAS IN STORES, AND SO ON.
IT WAS AN IMMENSELY MOVING THING.
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWO MILLION PEOPLE, IT SEEMED LIKE,
UP AND DOWN 5th AVENUE AND EVERYWHERE, ALL JUST CHEERING,
AND THE COUNTRY JUST LIFTED ITSELF UP.
Roberts:
THIS WAS A GREAT THING THAT WAS HAPPENING.
THE COUNTRY WAS COMING OUT OF THIS INCREDIBLE MOOD.
ROOSEVELT WAS CHANGING NATIONAL DESPAIR TO HOPE.
Man:
♫THERE'S A NEW DAY IN VIEW♫
♫THERE'S GOLD IN THE BLUE♫
♫THERE IS HOPE IN THE HEARTS OF MEN♫
♫ALL THE WORLD'S ON THE WAY TO A SUNNIER DAY♫
♫FOR THE ROAD IS OPEN AGAIN!
♫
McCullough:
WHEN THE 100 DAYS WERE OVER,
ROOSEVELT HAD SIGNED 15 MAJOR BILLS INTO LAW
AND CREATED AN ALPHABET SOUP OF NEW GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
"WE HAVE HAD OUR REVOLUTION," ONE MAGAZINE REPORTED,
"AND WE LIKE IT."
Ginzberg:
EVERYTHING WAS UP FOR GRABS
IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS BASICALLY A CONSERVATIVE COUNTRY,
BUT NOW HAD A LEADER
TO WHOM ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WAS POSSIBLE.
THE LEAST IDEOLOGICAL PERSON THAT EVER LIVED.
THAT'S WHY I THINK HE WAS SUCH A GREAT SUCCESS.
A FEW TIMID PEOPLE WHO FEAR PROGRESS WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU
NEW AND STRANGE NAMES FOR WHAT WE ARE DOING.
SOMETIMES THEY WILL CALL IT FASCISM, AND SOMETIMES COMMUNISM
AND SOMETIMES REGIMENTATION, AND SOMETIMES SOCIALISM.
BUT IN SO DOING, THEY ARE TRYING
TO MAKE VERY COMPLEX AND THEORETICAL
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY VERY SIMPLE AND VERY PRACTICAL.
I believe in practical explanations and in practical policies.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT USED THE RADIO
TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND THEY LISTENED TO HIS "FIRESIDE CHATS"
AS IF HE WERE A CLOSE FRIEND.
In the present spirit of mutual confidence and the present spirit of mutual encouragement, we go forward.
McCullough:
BY THE END OF 1933
MANY OF ROOSEVELT'S MOST SKEPTICAL CRITICS
HAD BEEN CONVERTED.
AN AIDE WHO WORKED WITH HIM DURING THE WILSON YEARS
MARVELED, "THAT FELLOW IN THERE
"IS NOT THE FELLOW WE USED TO KNOW.
THERE'S BEEN A MIRACLE HERE."
IF ROOSEVELT EVER HAD ANY DOUBTS ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO DO THE JOB,
THEY EVAPORATED QUICKLY.
THE WHITE HOUSE, WHICH FOR SOME PRESIDENTS WAS A PRISON,
WAS, FOR F.D.R., HOME.
Woman:
I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION
THAT ROOSEVELT LOVED BEING PRESIDENT.
YOU KNOW HOW HE USED TO SAY, "I LOVE IT."
I SUSPECT IF SOMEBODY SAID TO HIM,
"HOW DO YOU LIKE BEING PRESIDENT?"
THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID, "I LOVE IT."
IT JUST SEEMED TO FIT HIS TEMPERAMENT,
I HAVE A FEELING HE LOVED GETTING UP IN THE MORNING,
LOVED GOING TO HIS OFFICE, ENJOYED THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN.
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANOTHER PRESIDENT
BEING MORE SUITED FOR THE PRESIDENCY
AND ENJOYING IT AS MUCH AS ROOSEVELT DID.
Leuchtenburg:
ROOSEVELT BELIEVED
THAT HE BELONGED IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
HIS IDEA OF WHO A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE
WAS HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT.
HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE GRANDEST JOB IN THE WORLD.
Ginsburg:
THIS WAS A MAN OF GREAT EBULLIENCE.
HE WAS A MAN OF CONSTANT CHEER.
HE WAS A MAN OF CIGARETTES.
IT WOULD BE A CONSTANT FLOW OF LAUGHTER AND JOKES.
THERE WAS NEVER A MOMENT
THAT ONE HAD A FEELING THAT HE SUDDENLY FELT HELPLESS
OR SUDDENLY UNCERTAIN OF WHAT TO DO.
HE KNEW WHAT TO DO, AND HE WOULD DO IT.
Cooke:
HE WAS IMMENSELY CUNNING,
AND WHAT PEOPLE HAD NOT REALIZED WAS HIS EXTRAORDINARY GUILE.
I MEAN, I THINK HE WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF TELLING
WHAT WINSTON CHURCHILL CALLED "A TERMINOLOGICAL INEXACTITUDE"
AND NEVER BLUSH.
AND HE HAD THIS MARVELOUS FACE
OF, YOU KNOW, TOTAL PLACID SINCERITY AND EARNESTNESS,
AND HE HAD A GREAT GIFT OF SEEMING TO THINK
THAT YOU WERE ABOUT THE WISEST MAN
THAT HE'D EVER CONSULTED ON ANYTHING,
UNTIL YOU FOUND HE HAD NO USE FOR YOU THE MOMENT YOU LEFT.
McCullough:
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED HIMSELF
AS PRESIDENT.
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS
THE LAST PLACE ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WANTED TO BE.
"I NEVER WANTED TO BE A PRESIDENT'S WIFE," SHE SAID,
"AND I DON'T WANT IT NOW."
BY 1933, ELEANOR AND HER HUSBAND
WERE LEADING ALL BUT SEPARATE LIVES.
15 YEARS EARLIER, ROOSEVELT'S AFFAIR
WITH ELEANOR'S SOCIAL SECRETARY, LUCY MERCER,
HAD ENDED THE INTIMACIES OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE.
BUT THEY HAD DEVELOPED A POLITICAL PARTNERSHIP
AND ELEANOR HAD BUILT A LIFE OF HER OWN.
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD REAL RESERVATIONS
ABOUT MOVING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.
SHE KNEW THE SOCIAL ROLE.
SHE KNEW HOW ALL-CONSUMING IT COULD BE.
SHE HAD BECOME A FIGURE IN HER OWN RIGHT
AND WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, EVEN SOMEWHAT OF A POWER,
AND THE THOUGHT OF GOING TO WASHINGTON, SHE WAS APPALLED.
Goodwin:
ALL SHE SAW WAS
SOCIAL CEREMONIAL JOBS, WHICH SHE HATED.
SHE ALWAYS SAID SHE WAS NEVER GOOD AT SMALL TALK.
I'M SURE SHE IMAGINED THAT IN THE FIRST LADYSHIP
SHE'D BE TALKING SMALL TALK
FOR ALL THE YEARS THEY WERE IN THERE.
McCullough:
"AT THE FIRST FEW RECEPTIONS," ELEANOR WROTE,
"MY ARMS ACHED, MY SHOULDERS ACHED, MY BACK ACHED.
I WAS LUCKY IN HAVING A SUPPLE HAND, WHICH NEVER ACHED."
"I REALIZED," SHE SAID,
"THAT IF I REMAINED IN THE WHITE HOUSE ALL THE TIME,
I WOULD LOSE TOUCH WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD."
Woman:
SHE WANTED HER FREEDOM.
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
CURTAILED BY PROTOCOL
BY BEING THE WIFE OF THE HEAD OF A GOVERNMENT.
SHE WANTED TO PACK UP A BAG, GET INTO HER LITTLE CAR
AND GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY.
McCullough:
DURING HER HUSBAND'S FIRST YEAR AS PRESIDENT,
ELEANOR TRAVELED MORE THAN 40,000 MILES,
REPORTING BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE NEW DEAL.
(cheering)
Goodwin:
NEVER BEFORE HAD A FIRST LADY TAKEN TO THE ROAD
AND TRAVELED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES
ON HER OWN SUPPORTING HER HUSBAND.
WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR WAS THE HUMAN DETAIL
THAT SHE COULD BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND
TO LET HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PEOPLE OF HIS LAND
WERE THINKING, FEELING AND HOPING.
Roberts:
SHE BECAME HIS LEGS.
SHE BECAME HIS EMISSARY.
SHE COULD GO PLACES THAT HE COULDN'T GO
AND SHE WENT EVERYWHERE.
McCullough:
ELEANOR WROTE A DAILY COLUMN CALLED "MY DAY,"
HELD WEEKLY PRESS CONFERENCES,
RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LETTERS.
HER POPULARITY RATINGS WERE SOMETIMES EVEN HIGHER
THAN HER HUSBAND'S.
Man:
HE COULD MAKE A GREAT SPEECH,
BUT MRS. ROOSEVELT WENT OUT AND INTERMINGLED WITH THE PEOPLE.
WELL, SHE WOULD SOMETIMES PICK UP SOMEONE OFF THE STREET
AND BRING THEM IN FOR LUNCH
AND SHE WOULD INVITE PEOPLE TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO DINNER,
FOR A STATE DINNER.
AND THEY HAD NEVER HAD A TUXEDO ON IN THEIR LIVES,
AND THEY'D COME THERE AND UNPACK AND NO TUXEDO
AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE DINNER.
THEN WHAT WOULD WE DO?
WE WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE LOCKER WHERE WE HAD SUPPLIES--
UNIFORMS FOR THE BUTLERS-- AND FIT THEM OUT IN THAT.
McCullough:
THE WOMAN WHO NEVER WANTED TO BE FIRST LADY
REVOLUTIONIZED THE ROLE.
MORE AND MORE, ELEANOR BECAME THE WHITE HOUSE ADVOCATE
FOR WOMEN, FACTORY WORKERS, TENANT FARMERS, BLACKS,
OFTEN PRESSING HER HUSBAND TO MOVE FASTER
THAN HE WAS PREPARED TO MOVE.
Goodwin:
ELEANOR SENT SO MANY MEMOS INTO HIS BEDROOM AT NIGHT
THAT AFTER A WHILE, HE HAD TO CREATE AN ELEANOR BASKET
JUST TO HOLD ALL THESE MEMOS.
AND THEN, AFTER A WHILE, HE HAD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH HER,
SAYING, "ELEANOR, THREE MEMOS A NIGHT--
NOT 12, NOT 20, NOT 30.
I WILL INITIAL THEM AND DEAL WITH THEM BY MORNING."
SOMETIMES SHE KEPT HER BARGAIN,
BUT MY SENSE IS THAT MORE THAN THREE WENT IN THERE MANY NIGHTS.
Curtis Roosevelt:
WHAT THEY HAD TOGETHER, MY GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER,
WAS WHAT I CALL A CREATIVE TENSION.
THEY BOTH BASICALLY BELIEVED IN THE SAME THINGS,
BUT THEY HAD DIFFERENT ROLES TO PLAY.
HE HAD TO WORK WITH THE CONGRESS.
HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
WHICH MEANT NOT THE LIBERALS IN THE UNITED STATES.
IT MEANT EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES.
SHE WAS ABLE TO INFLUENCE ISSUES AND HE WAS DELIGHTED.
BUT HE COULD ALSO DISOWN HER
AND DID WITH THE PRESS.
HE WOULD SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW MY MISSUS.
I DON'T DICTATE WHAT SHE SAYS," OR, "I DON'T CONTROL HER."
HE WAS VERY CHARMING ABOUT IT,
BUT IN A WAY IT WAS JUST SAYING, "OH, SHE CAN SAY WHAT SHE LIKES.
THAT DOESN'T REPRESENT MY POSITION."
WHICH WAS VERY, VERY CONVENIENT,
VERY CONVENIENT FOR HIM TO, THROUGH HER,
SENSE HOW FAR HE COULD GO.
McCullough:
BY 1934, ROOSEVELT HAD BEEN PRESIDENT FOR A YEAR,
YET IN SPITE OF ALL HIS NEW DEAL PROGRAMS, HARD TIMES PERSISTED.
Ginsburg:
THE DEPRESSION WAS TOO DEEP.
THE ORIGINS, THE ROOTS OF THE PROBLEM WERE TOO DEEP.
McCullough:
THE GOVERNMENT HAD SPENT
OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR RELIEF,
BUT THOUSANDS OF NEW PEOPLE WERE FORCED
ON THE WELFARE ROLES EACH DAY.
Leuchtenburg:
THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON WELFARE
RISE TO A QUARTER OF AN AMERICAN CITY.
ONE REPORTER IN 1934
COMES UPON A COUPLE LIVING IN A CAVE
IN CENTRAL PARK IN NEW YORK.
AND THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THE NEW DEAL--
ALTHOUGH IT HAD IMPROVED THINGS GREATLY
FROM THE WORST DAYS OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION--
WAS NOT REALLY GETTING THE COUNTRY BACK
TO PROSPEROUS DAYS AGAIN.
(glass breaking, crowd jeering)
McCullough:
DESPAIR TURNED TO ANGER.
VIOLENT PROTESTS AND STRIKES SWEPT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
BEWILDERED AND FRIGHTENED, MANY AMERICANS WERE DRAWN
TO AGITATORS CALLING FOR REFORMS MORE RADICAL THAN ROOSEVELT'S.
I DARED YOU AND CHALLENGED YOU TO ORGANIZE SO THAT THE PEOPLE,
IF NOT THE PRESIDENT...
McCullough:
FATHER CHARLES COUGHLIN,
A MAVERICK CATHOLIC PRIEST FROM DETROIT,
TURNED RADIO INTO A PULPIT
FROM WHICH HE BLASTED THE NEW DEAL,
DEMANDING A LIVING ANNUAL WAGE
AND NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKS.
WHO, THEN, IS THE INFLATIONIST?
ROOSEVELT OR THE NATIONAL UNION?
McCullough:
FRANCIS TOWNSEND, A RETIRED CALIFORNIA DOCTOR,
GALVANIZED MILLIONS OF SUPPORTERS
BY ADVOCATING A PLAN FOR OLD-AGE PENSIONS.
AND SENATOR HUEY LONG FROM LOUISIANA,
WITH HIS "SHARE- OUR-WEALTH PROGRAM,"
HAD HIS EYE ON THE PRESIDENCY.
"I CAN TAKE HIM," LONG SAID OF ROOSEVELT.
"HE'S SCARED OF ME.
"I CAN OUTPROMISE HIM, AND HE KNOWS IT.
"HIS MOTHER'S WATCHING HIM AND SHE WON'T LET HIM GO TOO FAR.
"HE'S LIVING ON AN INHERITED INCOME.
PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE ME AND THEY WON'T BELIEVE HIM."
ROOSEVELT'S CONSENSUS WAS BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL.
DURING THE EUPHORIA OF HIS FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE,
EVEN REPUBLICANS HAD SUPPORTED HIM.
NOW THEY TURNED AGAINST HIM.
Man:
THE NEW DEAL IS GOVERNMENT FROM ABOVE.
IT IS BASED ON THE PROPOSITION
THAT THE PEOPLE CANNOT MANAGE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
AND THAT A GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY MUST MANAGE
FOR THEM.
McCullough:
REPUBLICANS CHARGED
THAT GOVERNMENT WAS BECOMING TOO BIG AND TOO INTRUSIVE.
Fletcher:
WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE
THESE ALPHABETICAL BUREAUCRATIC AGENCIES
BECOME PERMANENT FIXTURES IN OUR NATIONAL POLITICAL LIFE.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT GREW INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED
AS BUSINESS BEGAN TO ACCUSE HIM
OF MEDDLING WITH FREE ENTERPRISE.
WHEN HE REGULATED THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE BANKS,
THE CAPTAINS OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY WERE OUTRAGED.
THEY THOUGHT HE HAD COME IN, HE HAD DONE A VERY GOOD JOB--
THOSE FIRST 100 DAYS WERE ALL RIGHT--
BUT NOW HE SHOULD GIVE US A CHANCE
TO TAKE BACK AND RUN THE COUNTRY
AS WE ALWAYS HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RUNNING IT.
HE HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA ABOUT THAT.
McCullough:
WITH THE ELECTION JUST TWO YEARS AWAY,
THE ATTACKS ON ROOSEVELT BECAME MORE INTENSE THAN EVER.
ANGRY BUSINESSMEN FOUNDED THE LIBERTY LEAGUE,
DEDICATED TO STOPPING FURTHER NEW DEAL LEGISLATION.
Cooke:
THE DISCOVERY OF WHAT A POLITICAL WIZARD HE WAS
WAS WHAT FIRED A LOT OF HATRED OF ROOSEVELT,
BECAUSE THEY'D THOUGHT OF HIM AS SOMEBODY THEY COULD MANIPULATE,
A SPLENDID, WELL-MEANING, RATHER GENTEEL TYPE.
THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT.
THEN THEY DISCOVERED THEY HAVE AN ABSOLUTE MASTER POLITICIAN,
MISCHIEF MAKER, CUNNING MAN,
AND THEY HATED HIM ALL THE MORE BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN FOOLED.
McCullough:
THEN ON MAY 27, 1935,
A DAY NEW DEALERS WOULD REMEMBER AS BLACK MONDAY,
THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK AT THE VERY HEART OF ROOSEVELT'S HOPE
TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY.
THEY DECLARED THE N.R.A., THE NATIONAL RECOVERY ACT,
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND IT WAS JUST THE FIRST BLOW.
THE COURT WAS MOVING AGAINST ROOSEVELT'S EFFORTS
TO ABOLISH CHILD LABOR, ESTABLISH A MINIMUM WAGE,
BOOST FARM PRICES.
LAW BY LAW, THE COURT WOULD ATTEMPT TO DISMANTLE THE WORK
OF THE FIRST 100 DAYS.
BUT WITH MILLIONS STILL UNEMPLOYED,
ROOSEVELT CONTINUED TO USE THE POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERING CAUSED BY THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
Leuchtenburg:
CONGRESS, AT ROOSEVELT'S REQUEST,
ENACTS THE EMERGENCY WORK RELIEF APPROPRIATIONS ACT,
WHICH IS THE LARGEST SINGLE PEACETIME APPROPRIATION
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY
OR ANY COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
Announcer:
NEW YORK CITY:
FEDERAL JOBS FOR THOUSANDS
AT THE RATE OF 100 A MINUTE,
WHILE ALL OVER THE NATION,
WORK PROGRESS ADMINISTRATORS ARE HURRYING
TO TRANSFER MILLIONS OF IDLE
FROM RELIEF ROLLS TO WORK PAYROLLS.
138 GREENE STREET, NEW YORK,
TOMORROW MORNING, 9:00.
MUNICIPAL BUILDING BOROUGH HALL,
BROOKLYN, TOMORROW MORNING, 9:00.
McCullough:
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WENT
TO THE WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION, THE W.P.A.
MEN AND WOMEN HIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT WORKED
ON MORE THAN 5,000 SCHOOLS, 2,500 HOSPITALS, 1,000 LANDING FIELDS,
13,000 PLAYGROUNDS.
EVEN ARTISTS WENT TO WORK FOR THE W.P.A.
BUT FOR ROOSEVELT, THIS WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.
HE WOULD BRING POWER TO RURAL AMERICA,
WHERE NINE OUT OF EVERY TEN FAMILIES STILL LIVED
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.
MA, JUST LOOK AT THAT.
FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, IMPOVERISHED CHILDREN,
THE UNEMPLOYED, THE ELDERLY WITH NO SAVINGS, THE DISABLED,
HE OFFERED THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT.
HE SOLD IT AS AN INSURANCE POLICY FOR EVERYONE.
BUT THE POOR, ROOSEVELT WAS SAYING, HAD RIGHTS TOO.
Ginsburg:
THE GREAT TRADITION IN THE UNITED STATES HAD BEEN
PRIVATE CHARITY, COMMUNITY CHARITY.
FAMILIES TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN.
AND SO THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THE GOVERNMENT WOULD
TAKE CARE OF THE POOR OR THE UNEMPLOYED OR THE OLD--
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST NOT PART OF OUR TRADITION.
WE DIDN'T KNOW OF IT.
THIS SOCIAL SECURITY MEASURE GIVES AT LEAST SOME PROTECTION
TO 30 MILLIONS OF OUR CITIZENS WHO WILL REAP DIRECT BENEFITS
THROUGH UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION,
THROUGH OLD-AGE PENSIONS,
AND THROUGH INCREASED SERVICES FOR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN
AND THE PREVENTION OF ILL HEALTH.
(applause)
McCullough:
BY THE END OF HIS FIRST TERM,
ROOSEVELT HAD BEGUN TO SHIFT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN AMERICA.
THE RICH FELT THE STING OF HIGHER TAXES
AND WORKERS ACQUIRED THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY.
SOON GREAT AMERICAN INDUSTRIES-- STEEL, RUBBER, AUTOMOBILES--
WOULD BE UNIONIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME.
AND THE MEN F.D.R. GREW UP WITH, WHO WENT TO GROTON AND HARVARD,
HAD BEGUN TO SAY,
"THAT MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE HAS GONE TOO FAR."
PEOPLE FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S CLASS,
WHEN HE FIRST WAS ELECTED,
HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO ANYTHING
AS RADICAL AS HE DID DO.
THEY REALLY BELIEVED
THAT BECAUSE HE WAS ONE OF THEM, MORE OR LESS,
PROPERTIED AND COMING FROM OLD NEW YORK SOCIETY,
THAT THE LAST THING THAT HE WOULD DO WOULD BE ANYTHING
THAT WOULD CAUSE ANGUISH TO HIS PEERS.
Curtis Roosevelt:
PEOPLE WHO HELD A POSITION IN SOCIETY
THAT WAS BASICALLY INHERITED AND FAMILY ORIENTED
INSTINCTIVELY FELT THAT THIS WAS BEING LOST
AND THAT "THAT MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE," FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT,
WAS RESPONSIBLE AND, HENCE, HE WAS A TRAITOR TO HIS CLASS.
THEY HATED HIM,
AND I KNOW THIS FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE
WHO WOULD COME UP TO ME--
NOT JUST WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WAS ALIVE, BUT FOR...
EVER SINCE,
BUT PARTICULARLY SAY IN THE TEN AND 15 YEARS AFTER HE DIED--
AND EXPRESS THEIR VITRIOLIC HATE TOWARDS FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
IN A WAY THAT IS TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.
A GREAT YACHTSMAN IN MARBLEHEAD, MASS., MR. CROWNINGSHIELD,
WHEN HE...
WHEN ON HIS ENTERING IN HIS LOG BOOK OF HIS YACHT
A DESCRIPTION OF SOMETHING REALLY TERRIBLE,
HE REFERRED TO IT AS "A ROOSEVELT."
IT WAS BLOWING "AN ABSOLUTE ROOSEVELT" THAT DAY
AND THE FOG WAS THICKER THAN A "ROOSEVELT."
BECAUSE HE USED THE WORD "ROOSEVELT."
I MEAN, IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS,
BUT THAT WAS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PEOPLE
TOOK THEIR HOSTILITY TO THE NEW DEAL.
McCullough:
THE RICH AND THE PRIVILEGED MIGHT HATE HIM,
BUT AS HIS FIRST TERM WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE,
ROOSEVELT REMAINED IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH ORDINARY AMERICANS.
IN SPITE OF PERSISTENT HARD TIMES,
THE PRESIDENT HAD GIVEN THEM HOPE.
Cooke:
THE MOST ASTOUNDING THING
WAS THE PICTURES OF ROOSEVELT YOU SAW:
FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS, FRAMED BAD WATERCOLORS,
GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS, BAD PHOTOGRAPHS,
BUT EVERYWHERE-
- BUS STATIONS, LIBRARIES, BARBERSHOPS, HOMES--
THERE WERE PICTURES OF ROOSEVELT.
I WENT INTO THIS LODGE AND AS WE WERE CHECKING IN,
I LOOKED AND SAW THIS PHOTOGRAPH,
YOU KNOW, WHERE THE CLERK WAS CHECKING US IN,
AND IT WAS RATHER BAD.
IT HAD BEEN VERY BAD COLOR WITH SORT OF ROUGE CHEEKS,
AND I MADE A JOKE ABOUT THIS--
YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEY'D DONE HIM UP--
AND WE WERE THROWN OUT.
NOW THAT WAS THE STRIKING THING.
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH PARTISANSHIP.
YOU KNOW, FOR THE TIME BEING,
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY DECIDED HE WAS THE SAVIOR.
I DON'T BELIEVE FIVE AMERICANS IN 100 KNEW HE WAS PARALYZED.
I THINK IF IT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY COMMON KNOWLEDGE,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO ELECT HIM.
Man:
THE COUNTRY JUST SIMPLY DIDN'T PERCEIVE ROOSEVELT
AS BEING HANDICAPPED.
AND THEY WOULD LOOK,
AND THEY JUST WOULD NOT SEE WHAT THEY WERE SEEING.
THE PEOPLE WANTED HIM TO BE PRESIDENT
AND HE WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT.
THERE WAS THIS LITTLE MATTER OF BEING CRIPPLED IN THE WAY.
I DID MY TALK YESTERDAY.
Gallagher:
THE PRESIDENT WAS ALWAYS PERFORMING.
Man:
IS THERE A MR. FOSTER IN THERE?
THERE HE IS.
Gallagher:
HE WAS PERFORMING BEFORE CROWDS,
BEFORE VISITORS OF STATE, THE CONGRESS AND SO FORTH,
BUT ALSO FOR HIS FAMILY AND EVERYONE ELSE.
WHEN HE MET ORSON WELLES,
HE SAID, "ORSON, YOU AND I ARE THE TWO BEST ACTORS IN AMERICA."
AND HE WAS RIGHT, YOU KNOW, HE WAS RIGHT.
HE'S APPEARING IN PUBLIC.
IT'S POLITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT HE NOT LOOK HELPLESS.
HE'S GOT TO PLAN, HOW WILL HE ENTER A ROOM?
HOW WILL HE MOVE ACROSS TO THE CHAIR?
WHO WILL HELP HIM SIT DOWN?
HOW WILL HE DO IT?
WHO WILL TAKE THE CANE?
HOW...
DO THEY KNOW?
IS THE CHAIR STABLE?
WE BECAME EXPERTS AT DESIGNING RAMPS,
AND THERE WOULD BE RAMPS THAT WOULD BE ERECTED
EITHER ON A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BASIS
TO ALLOW FOR THE WHEELCHAIR.
OF COURSE, THERE WERE TIMES
WHEN HE WOULD BE HELPED
BY A COUPLE OF AGENTS IN A FIREMAN'S CARRY,
AND ALL HE WOULD DO IS DRAPE HIS ARMS AROUND US,
AND WE'D FORM A FIREMAN'S CARRY AND CARRY HIM.
Gallagher:
FOR LARGE CROWDS,
THEY WOULD BUILD A RAMP FOR THE CAR,
SO THE CAR WOULD COME INTO THE STADIUMS, DRIVE UP ON THE RAMP
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT, STILL SEATED,
WOULD ADDRESS THE PUBLIC.
THEY HAD THE BRACES PAINTED BLACK,
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SHINY STEEL.
HE WORE BLACK SHOES, BLACK SOCKS, BLACK TROUSERS,
BLACK TROUSERS CUT LONG,
SO THAT THE BRACES ALL BUT DISAPPEARED
IF YOU WEREN'T LOOKING CLOSELY.
Roberts:
MOST OF THE PICTURES YOU SEE OF HIM,
HE'S EITHER STANDING UP AND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY,
HE'S HOLDING ONTO SOMEBODY'S ARM OR HE'S SITTING IN A CHAIR.
VERY FEW PICTURES OF HIM IN A WHEELCHAIR.
THIS WAS NOT EXACTLY A CONSPIRACY,
BUT IT WAS A CONSPIRACY OF CONSENT
BETWEEN PHOTOGRAPHERS AND THE WHITE HOUSE,
SOMETHING THAT COULD NEVER EXIST TODAY.
Gallagher:
AT HYDE PARK,
THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE MORE THAN 40,000 STILL PHOTOS
OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT,
AND OF THOSE 40,000, THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF HIM IN A WHEELCHAIR
AND THEY WERE FAMILY PHOTOS.
AND THERE WAS NEVER A CARTOON OF HIM BEING HANDICAPPED
OR BEING IN A WHEELCHAIR OR OTHERWISE.
HE WAS ALWAYS RUNNING AND JUMPING
OR IN A BOXING RING HITTING, KNOCKING A REPUBLICAN
OUT OF THE RING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
PEOPLE WERE MORE POLITE BACK THEN.
AND THE PRESS LOVED FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT
BECAUSE HE TOOK CARE OF THEM.
I CAN'T BE TRUTHFUL AND SAY THAT I'M GLAD TO GET BACK.
I'M AWFULLY SORRY TO GET BACK.
(laughter)
BUT WHILE I'VE BEEN HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME,
I GATHER ALSO THAT BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS
HAVE BEEN HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME IN MY ABSENCE.
Roberts:
HE WAS AWFUL GOOD AT CHARMING YOU.
YOU HAD TO BE AWFUL CAREFUL YOU DIDN'T GET BADLY SEDUCED.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DID.
HE HAD THE PRESS WITH HIM HEART AND SOUL.
IF HE MADE A CRACK, THE PLACE WOULD BUST INTO AN UPROAR
AS THOUGH THEY WERE DOING IT TO APPLAUD A TV COMEDIAN.
AND I'VE COME BACK WITH ALL SORTS OF NEW LESSONS
WHICH I LEARNED FROM BARRACUDA AND SHARKS.
I'M A TOUGH GUY.
(laughter)
Trohan:
I'VE HEARD HIM TELL WOMEN
HOW HARD IT WAS FOR HIM TO GO THROUGH THE PRESS CONFERENCE
BECAUSE THESE MEN WERE SO ALERT AND SO SHARP
THAT HE HAD TO KEEP ON HIS TOES, SO TO SPEAK, EVERY MINUTE.
WELL, IT WASN'T SO.
THEY WERE ALL WITH HIM.
Reporter:
PRESIDENT, HOW SOON YOU COMING BACK?
Roosevelt:
JUST AS SOON AS CONGRESS WILL LET ME.
(laughter)
Trohan:
AND HE LIKED JOKES
AND HE LIKED TRADING JOKES.
I USED TO MAKE DIRTY CRACKS AT SOMETHING UNDER THE NEW DEAL
AND HE'D COME BACK
AND MAKE DIRTY CRACKS AT MY PUBLISHER OR ME.
OR WE'D PLAY POKER WITH HIM,
WHICH WAS A RATHER GOOD INDEX TO HIS CHARACTER.
HE WAS A GREAT BLUFFER.
AND A LOT OF REPORTERS WOULD LOSE TO HIM
AND ENJOY PUTTING DOWN ON THE EXPENSE ACCOUNT
"LOST TO PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AT POKER."
I NEVER CLAIMED A LOSS.
McCullough:
BY 1936, GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION SEEMED TO BE WORKING.
UNEMPLOYMENT WAS STILL HIGH,
BUT SIX MILLION PEOPLE HAD BEEN PUT BACK TO WORK.
CORPORATE PROFITS WERE RISING.
DETROIT WAS NOW ROLLING OUT ALMOST AS MANY CARS AND TRUCKS
AS WERE BEING PRODUCED BEFORE THE DEPRESSION BEGAN.
AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT
THAT ROOSEVELT WOULD BE RENOMINATED BY ACCLAMATION.
Roosevelt:
WE ARE FIGHTING--
FIGHTING TO SAVE A GREAT AND PRECIOUS FORM OF GOVERNMENT
FOR OURSELVES AND FOR THE WORLD,
AND SO I ACCEPT THE COMMISSION YOU HAVE TENDERED ME.
I JOIN WITH YOU.
I AM ENLISTED FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR.
McCullough:
THE NEW DEAL WAS AT HIGH TIDE
AND F.D.R. WAS IN TOP FORM.
"THERE'S ONE ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN," HE TOLD AN ADVISOR.
"IT'S MYSELF, AND PEOPLE MUST BE EITHER FOR ME OR AGAINST ME."
Roberts:
THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY
WAS THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.
THERE WAS MOTION.
I NEVER HAD ANY DOUBT
THAT ROOSEVELT WAS GOING TO BE REELECTED IN '36.
YOU COULD SMELL IT.
Leuchtenburg:
MILE AFTER MILE, ROOSEVELT'S ENTOURAGE
COULD BARELY GET THROUGH THE STREETS OF WELL-WISHERS.
AND PEOPLE COULD HEAR INDIVIDUALS CALL OUT,
"HE GAVE ME A JOB."
"HE SAVED MY HOME."
IN THE FREIGHT YARDS IN DENVER,
SOMEONE HAD SCRAWLED IN CHALK, "ROOSEVELT IS MY FRIEND."
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT WAS SO SUPREMELY CONFIDENT
THAT HE NEVER EVEN MENTIONED HIS REPUBLICAN OPPONENT.
HE SAVED HIS FIRE FOR THE LEADERS OF BIG BUSINESS.
Roosevelt:
GOVERNMENT BY ORGANIZED MONEY
IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AS GOVERNMENT BY ORGANIZED MOBS.
(crowd cheering)
NEVER BEFORE IN ALL OUR HISTORY
HAVE THESE FORCES BEEN SO UNITED AGAINST ONE CANDIDATE
AS THEY STAND TODAY.
THEY ARE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR HATE FOR ME
AND I WELCOME THEIR HATRED!
(loud cheering)
McCullough:
THE REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION ACCUSED ROOSEVELT
OF TURNING CLASS AGAINST CLASS.
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT ALSO CAME UNDER ATTACK
FOR HER TIRELESS ADVOCACY OF NEW DEAL REFORMS
AND ESPECIALLY FOR HER SYMPATHIES
WITH THE STRUGGLE OF BLACK AMERICANS.
FOR THE THINGS THAT WE AS AFRICAN AMERICANS LOVED HER,
THERE WERE TOO MANY AMERICANS WHO HATED HER.
HERE WAS A WOMAN COMING FROM THE TOP CLASS IN OUR COUNTRY
AND HERE SHE WAS, MOVING INTO POOR NEIGHBORHOODS.
HERE SHE WAS, SITTING IN GROUPS OF PEOPLE
OF ALL RACES AND ALL BACKGROUNDS.
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PROGRAM,
BUT A LOT THAT SHE DID HELPED TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK
THAT WE COULD BUILD UPON LATER YEARS IN CIVIL RIGHTS.
AND OF COURSE, MANY HATED HER FOR IT.
Woman:
THE WHOLE THING WAS A PARADOX.
SHE WAS LOVED AND DESPISED BOTH,
DEPENDENT ON WHERE YOU SAT, YOU MIGHT SAY--
WHAT YOUR NEEDS WERE, WAS SHE FILLING YOUR NEEDS
OR WAS SHE STEPPING ON YOUR TOES?
Leuchtenburg:
ON ELECTION NIGHT,
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WAS AT HYDE PARK
AND WHEN THE FIRST RETURNS CAME IN,
HE LET OUT A PUFF OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AND SAID, "WOW!"
IT WAS THE FIRST INDICATION OF A LANDSLIDE VICTORY.
ROOSEVELT WOULD CARRY EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY
EXCEPT MAINE AND VERMONT.
McCullough:
IT WAS THE BIGGEST POPULAR MARGIN IN HISTORY.
Man:
♫NO MORE BREAD LINES, WE'RE GLAD TO SAY♫
♫THE DONKEY WON ELECTION DAY♫
♫NO MORE STANDIN' IN THE BLOWIN' SNOW AND RAIN♫
♫HE'S GOT THINGS IN FULL SWAY♫
♫WE'RE ALL A-WORKIN' AND A-GETTIN' OUR PAY♫
♫WE'VE GOT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT BACK AGAIN.♫
♫BACK AGAIN, BACK AGAIN♫
♫BACK AGAIN, BACK AGAIN...♫
McCullough:
F.D.R. HAD CHANGED
THE AMERICAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.
WHEREVER AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE,
THEY ABANDONED THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN
TO VOTE DEMOCRATIC.
INNER-CITY IMMIGRANTS, WORKING MEN AND WOMEN,
WHITE SOUTHERNERS--
ROOSEVELT HAD CREATED A NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY COALITION.
(crowd chanting and whistling)
Ginzberg:
ROOSEVELT BECAME OVERCONFIDENT
FROM THAT OVERWHELMING VICTORY.
HE THOUGHT HE HAD THE COUNTRY IN THE PALM OF HIS HANDS.
I THINK HIS GUARD WAS DOWN.
McCullough:
THE PRESIDENT STILL FACED POWERFUL POLITICAL ENEMIES
DETERMINED TO UNDERMINE HIS PROGRAMS.
JANUARY 20, 1937-
- THE DAY OF HIS SECOND INAUGURATION.
HE HAD ALREADY DEVELOPED A PLAN TO TAKE THEM ON.
Chief Justice:
YOU, FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT,
DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR
THAT YOU WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE...
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT WAS ABOUT TO CHALLENGE
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Chief Justice:
AND WILL, TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY,
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES?
McCullough:
WHEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE
CAME TO THE WORDS "DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION,"
ROOSEVELT LATER SAID, "I FELT LIKE SAYING,
'NOT THE KIND OF CONSTITUTION YOUR COURT HAS RAISED UP
AS A BARRIER TO PROGRESS AND DEMOCRACY.'"
THE SUPREME COURT
HAD BEEN LEADING THE OPPOSITION TO THE NEW DEAL,
REJECTING ONE ROOSEVELT LAW AFTER ANOTHER.
NOW ROOSEVELT FEARED THAT THE COURT WAS PREPARING
TO STRIKE DOWN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT
AND THE LAW THAT GAVE UNIONS THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.
IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION,
ROOSEVELT VENTED HIS ANGER AT A DEMOCRATIC PARTY DINNER.
THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE CONGRESS
MADE A GALLANT, SINCERE EFFORT
TO RAISE WAGES, TO REDUCE HOURS, TO ABOLISH CHILD LABOR
AND TO ELIMINATE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES.
(smattering of applause)
Leuchtenburg:
ROOSEVELT NOT ONLY WANTED A COURT
THAT WOULD RULE FAVORABLY ON NEW DEAL LEGISLATION,
HE WANTED A MEASURE OF REVENGE
BECAUSE HE TOOK PERSONALLY A NUMBER OF THE OPINIONS,
A NUMBER OF THE ACTIONS OF THE COURT.
AND I DEFY ANYONE TO READ THE OPINIONS
CONCERNING THE TRIPLE A, THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT,
THE NATIONAL RECOVERY ACT, THE GUFFEY COAL ACT,
AND THE NEW YORK MINIMUM WAGE LAW
AND TELL US EXACTLY WHAT, IF ANYTHING, WE CAN DO
FOR THE INDUSTRIAL WORKER IN THIS SESSION OF THE CONGRESS
WITH ANY REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT WHAT WE DO
WILL NOT BE NULLIFIED AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Ginzberg:
HE WAS UPSET--
HAD GOOD REASONS TO BE UPSET--
BUT ONE OF THE FEW TIMES IN HIS LIFE, I THINK,
THAT HE MISCALCULATED.
McCullough:
TO SAVE THE NEW DEAL,
ROOSEVELT PROPOSED A RADICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION:
A BILL TO GIVE HIM THE POWER
TO APPOINT ADDITIONAL JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT
AND OUTNUMBER HIS OPPONENTS.
ON CAPITOL HILL, CRITICS ARGUED
THAT ROOSEVELT'S BILL CHALLENGED THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF.
I SHALL NOT BE A PARTY TO BREAKING DOWN
THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF THE CONSTITUTION.
A PACKED JURY, A PACKED COURT AND A STUFFED BALLOT BOX
ARE ALL ON THE SAME MORAL PLANE.
THIS IS MORE POWER THAN A GOOD MAN SHOULD WANT
OR A BAD MAN SHOULD HAVE.
THIS IS A NONPARTISAN BATTLE
TO PRESERVE AN INDEPENDENT SUPREME COURT.
McCullough:
DETERMINED TO WIN VOTES FOR HIS COURT PLAN,
ROOSEVELT WAS NOW IN THE CONGRESSIONAL FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.
HE DANGLED PROMISES OF FEDERAL PROJECTS,
HINTED AT JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS,
THREATENED TO WITHDRAW PATRONAGE.
AT A PICNIC FOR DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMEN,
HE TURNED ON ALL HIS CHARM.
THIS TIME, IT DIDN'T WORK.
ON JULY 20, HE ASKED HIS VICE-PRESIDENT, JACK GARNER,
WHAT HIS CHANCES WERE WITH CONGRESS.
"DO YOU WANT IT WITH THE BARK ON OR OFF, CAP'N?" GARNER REPLIED.
"THE ROUGH WAY."
"ALL RIGHT.
"YOU'RE BEAT.
YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE VOTES."
Ginsburg:
AND THE PRICE THAT HE PAID WAS VERY HIGH.
IT WAS A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF THE COUNTRY,
IT WAS A RECOGNITION BY HIS OPPONENTS IN POLITICS
THAT THEY COULD BEAT HIM,
IT WAS A RECOGNITION ON HIS PART
THAT HE HAD LOST SOME MEASURE OF POWER.
McCullough:
AND THEN THE ECONOMY SNAPPED.
THE STOCK MARKET CRASHED AGAIN, BUSINESSES FAILED
AND BY DECEMBER, TWO MILLION MORE PEOPLE HAD LOST THEIR JOBS.
HIS OPPONENTS CALLED IT "THE ROOSEVELT RECESSION."
AN AIDE OBSERVED THAT ROOSEVELT SEEMED DEPRESSED.
"HIS FACE IS HEAVILY LINED," A MEMBER OF HIS CABINET WROTE.
"HE IS DISTINCTLY MORE NERVOUS,
"PUNCH-DRUNK FROM THE PUNISHMENT HE HAS SUFFERED--
A BEATEN MAN."
McCullough:
THE MOMENTUM BEHIND THE NEW DEAL WAS SLOWING DOWN.
CONGRESS WAS REASSERTING ITS AUTHORITY,
THE PRESS WAS TURNING MORE CRITICAL,
AND HE NOW FACED AN EVEN MORE TERRIBLE CRISIS.
FAR AWAY, FASCIST ARMIES WERE MARCHING.
ADOLF HITLER'S GERMANY HAD SEIZED THE RHINELAND...
BENITO MUSSOLINI'S ITALY CRUSHED ETHIOPIA...
EMPEROR HIROHITO'S JAPAN RAVAGED CHINA.
ROOSEVELT PRIVATELY CALLED THEM "THE THREE BANDIT NATIONS."
IN 1936, HE HAD WRITTEN HIS AMBASSADOR IN BERLIN:
"EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE BROKEN LOOSE AGAIN
"IN YOUR PART OF THE WORLD.
"ALL THE EXPERTS SAY THERE WILL BE NO WAR,
"BUT AS PRESIDENT, I HAVE TO BE READY,
JUST LIKE A FIRE DEPARTMENT."
BUT ROOSEVELT KNEW THAT AMERICA WAS NOT READY.
WE HAD AN ARMY THE SIZE OF THE ARMY OF SWEDEN.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THINK OF US TODAY
AS BEING A TREMENDOUS MILITARY POWER.
THE UNITED STATES NEVER WANTED TO BE A MILITARY POWER.
THE HABIT HAD BEEN, AFTER A WAR--
YOU MOBILIZE TWO MILLION GUYS--
AND THEY IMMEDIATELY DEMOBILIZED.
THERE'S NO THOUGHT IN THE MINDS IN THE GREAT BULK OF AMERICANS
THAT THEY WILL EVER SEND ANOTHER LAND ARMY TO EUROPE
TO FIGHT IN A WAR AGAIN.
THIS IS THE ABIDING FEELING IN THE UNITED STATES:
AVOID INVOLVEMENT IN ANY WAR.
Roberts:
MEMORIES OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR
WERE NOT ALL THAT FAR BEHIND
AND AMERICANS WERE VERY DISILLUSIONED ABOUT IT,
SO THEY BECAME ISOLATIONISTS.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT HAD TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY.
CONGRESS HAD PASSED A SERIES OF NEUTRALITY LAWS
FORBIDDING THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE SIDES.
WHENEVER ROOSEVELT SUGGESTED
THAT THE UNITED STATES PLAY ANY PART ON THE WORLD STAGE,
HE MET WITH VIOLENT ISOLATIONIST OPPOSITION.
TWO CONGRESSMEN EVEN THREATENED HIM WITH IMPEACHMENT.
Roberts:
FOR A LONG TIME,
THE PRINCIPAL BATTLE IN AMERICAN POLITICS AND IN WASHINGTON
WAS BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONALISTS
AND THE ISOLATIONISTS,
AND THE PEOPLE WHO HATED ROOSEVELT SAID,
"HE'S TRYING TO GET US INTO WAR."
Roosevelt:
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD
THAT I WAS ABOUT TO PLUNGE THE NATION INTO WAR,
THAT YOU AND YOUR LITTLE BROTHERS
WOULD BE SENT TO THE BLOODY FIELDS OF BATTLE IN EUROPE,
THAT I WAS DRIVING THE NATION INTO BANKRUPTCY
AND THAT I BREAKFASTED EVERY MORNING
ON A DISH OF GRILLED MILLIONAIRE.
(laughter)
Dallek:
ROOSEVELT, FROM THE START OF HIS PRESIDENCY,
IS TROUBLED BY HITLER.
AND PRIVATELY, HE'S DEEPLY CONCERNED,
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING IN PUBLIC.
HE KNOWS THE COUNTRY IS SO OPPOSED TO ANYTHING
THAT WOULD INVOLVE IT IN EUROPEAN POWER POLITICS.
ACTUALLY, I AM AN EXCEEDINGLY MILD-MANNERED PERSON--
A PRACTITIONER OF PEACE BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN... (laughter)
A BELIEVER IN THE CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM,
AND FOR MY BREAKFAST, A DEVOTEE OF SCRAMBLED EGGS.
(laughter and applause)
Dallek:
AND SO HE CATERS
TO THE ISOLATIONIST AND PACIFIST SENTIMENT IN THE COUNTRY,
BUT IF HE HAD HIS DRUTHERS, HE WOULD AVOID WAR
NOT BY RETREATING FROM INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
BUT BY PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS,
AND SO IT'S A MATTER OF METHOD.
HE WANTS TO AVOID WAR, BUT THE WAY TO DO IT, HE FEELS,
IS NOT TO BE ISOLATIONIST,
IS NOT TO PASS THESE NEUTRALITY BILLS,
BUT FOR THE UNITED STATES TO BE ASSERTIVE
AND PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL POWER POLITICS.
McCullough:
IN MARCH 1938, GERMAN TROOPS OCCUPIED AUSTRIA
WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT.
"THE DICTATOR NATIONS FIND THEIR BLUFFS ARE NOT BEING CALLED,"
ROOSEVELT WROTE A FRIEND IN FRUSTRATION.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA FELL NEXT.
ON SEPTEMBER 30, 1938, AT MUNICH,
THE BRITISH SIGNED A TREATY
WHICH RECOGNIZED HITLER'S NEW CONQUEST.
Eleanor Roosevelt:
FRANKLIN'S REACTION
TO THE MUNICH CONFERENCE WAS ONE OF GREAT DISCONTENT.
HE WAS VERY UNHAPPY.
OF COURSE, BEING IN AN OFFICIAL POSITION,
MY HUSBAND SAID LITTLE PUBLICLY.
McCullough:
THE PRESIDENT GREW
MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY.
Woman:
BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND MRS. ROOSEVELT
WOULD TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WENT ON.
HE WOULD SAY, "EVERY TIME ONE GIVES IN TO HITLER,
HIS AMBITIONS BECOME GREATER AND HE WANTS MORE."
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT FELT
THAT IN THE END, A WAR WAS UNAVOIDABLE.
McCullough:
BUT ROOSEVELT'S HANDS HAD BEEN TIED
BY CONGRESS AND A CAUTIOUS PUBLIC.
DESPERATE TO DO SOMETHING,
ROOSEVELT BROADCAST A PERSONAL APPEAL TO HITLER,
ASKING HIM TO HALT FURTHER AGGRESSION.
IN REPLY, HITLER RIDICULED THE POWERLESS PRESIDENT
WITH WITHERING SARCASM:
HERR ROOSEVELT VERLANGT ENDLICH DIE BEREITWILLIGKEIT
IHM DIE ZUSICHERUNG ZU GEBEN, DASS DIE DEUTSCHEN STREITKRAFTE
DAS STAATSGEBIET FOLGENDER UNABHANGIGER NATIONEN
NICHT ANGREIFEN
UND ER NENNT FINLAND, LETTLAND, LITAUEN, ESTLAND,
NORWEGEN, SCHWEDEN, DANEMARK, NIEDERLANDE, BELGIEN,
GROSSBRITANIEN, IRLAND, FRANKREICH, PORTUGAL,
SPANIEN, DIE SCHWEIZ, LIECHTENSTEIN, LUXEMBURG,
POLEN, UNGARN, RUMANIEN, YUGOSLAVIEN, RUSSLAND,
BULGARIEN, TURKEI, IRAK, ARABIEN, SYRIEN,
PALESTINA UND AGYPTEN.
(loud laughter)
Dallek:
IN ESSENCE, HE WAS BEING TOLD BY HITLER,
"YOU'RE NOT A PLAYER IN THIS WORLD POLITICAL GAME.
"WE DON'T COUNT YOU FOR VERY MUCH,
"AND WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A BIG POLITICAL HEADACHE--
"YOUR ISOLATIONISTS ARE NOT GOING TO LET YOU DO ANYTHING.
"YOU HAVE ALL THESE NEUTRALITY LAWS.
"IF WE GO TO WAR AGAINST BRITAIN AND FRANCE,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT SAY IN THINGS."
AND IT, I THINK, DEEPENED HIS FRUSTRATION.
HE KNEW IT.
HE KNEW HITLER WAS RIGHT IN THAT SENSE,
AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT WAS TIRED.
HE WAS ALREADY THINKING OF RETIRING TO HIS HYDE PARK HOME.
HIS SECOND TERM WAS COMING TO AN END,
AND NO PRESIDENT HAD EVER SERVED MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS.
"I THINK THERE WAS A GREAT SEESAW," ELEANOR WROTE.
"ON THE ONE END, THE WEARINESS AND THE DESIRE TO BE AT HOME;
"ON THE OTHER, THE OVERWHELMING DESIRE
TO HAVE A HAND IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD."
ELEANOR WAS URGING HER HUSBAND TO RETIRE,
YET SHE WAS KEENLY AWARE
THAT THE GOALS OF THE NEW DEAL HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED.
THERE WAS MUCH UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
(piano playing intro to "My Country 'tis Of Thee")
♫MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE♫
♫SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY♫
♫OF THEE WE SING...♫
McCullough:
ON EASTER SUNDAY THAT APRIL,
MARIAN ANDERSON SANG FROM THE STEPS OF THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
WITH AMERICA STILL DEEPLY SEGREGATED,
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BLACKS AND WHITES GATHERED TOGETHER
TO HONOR THE GREAT CONTRALTO.
♫...
FROM EVERY MOUNTAINSIDE♫
♫LET FREEDOM RING.♫
McCullough:
WITHOUT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT,
THE CONCERT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
WHEN ANDERSON WAS DENIED PERMISSION
TO SING IN A SEGREGATED HALL, ELEANOR WORKED BEHIND THE SCENES
TO BRING HER TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
Height:
MRS. ROOSEVELT INSPIRED IT.
SHE WANTED MARIAN ANDERSON, THE ARTIST,
TO HAVE HER MOMENT IN HISTORY
BUT IT WAS A MOMENT IN HISTORY FOR ALL OF US.
YOU HAD A FEELING THAT OFFICIAL WASHINGTON WAS SAYING,
"WE MAY BE DEEPLY SEGREGATED, AND WE HAVE ALL OF THIS STILL,
BUT HERE IS WHAT WE STAND FOR."
AND I THINK THAT WAS A GREAT MOMENT.
♫AVE MARIA...♫
♫GRATIA...♫
McCullough:
IF THIS HAD BEEN THE END
OF THE ROOSEVELT PRESIDENCY,
HE WOULD HAVE LEFT A MIXED RECORD.
IN HIS FIRST TERM, HE HAD RESTORED HOPE
TO A PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST HOPE,
USED THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY TO ENSURE
THAT THE GREAT DEPRESSION COULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
AND FORCED GOVERNMENT TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE WELL-BEING OF AMERICA'S POOREST CITIZENS.
BUT IN HIS SECOND TERM, HE SEEMED TO OVERREACH
AND THEN LOSE HIS WAY.
CONGRESS NO LONGER DID HIS BIDDING.
MILLIONS WERE STILL WITHOUT WORK
AND HE REMAINED HELPLESS IN THE FACE OF AGGRESSION OVERSEAS.
GERMANY AND ENGLAND WERE ON THE BRINK OF WAR.
(fanfare playing)
IN JUNE 1939, ROOSEVELT DID SOMETHING
NO PRESIDENT HAD EVER DONE BEFORE.
HE INVITED THE KING AND QUEEN OF ENGLAND TO AMERICA.
THE PRESIDENT HOPED THEIR VISIT
MIGHT INSPIRE AMERICANS WITH GREATER SYMPATHY FOR BRITAIN,
NOW FACED WITH THE NAZI THREAT.
Cooke:
THE IDEA OF THE KING AND QUEEN OF ENGLAND COMING TO AMERICA--
THERE'D NEVER BEEN SUCH A THING HAPPEN BEFORE.
IF IT HAD BEEN GEORGE III,
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE OF A SURPRISE.
McCullough:
THE PRESIDENT, BORN TO WEALTH AND PRIVILEGE,
WAS IN HIS ELEMENT.
"THE VISIT WAS PREPARED VERY CAREFULLY," ELEANOR LATER WROTE,
"BUT FRANKLIN ALWAYS BEHAVED
"AS THOUGH WE WERE SIMPLY GOING TO HAVE
TWO VERY NICE YOUNG PEOPLE TO STAY WITH US."
Cooke:
AND ROOSEVELT TOOK THEM OFF TO HYDE PARK
AND DROVE HIS OWN HAND-RUN AUTOMOBILE INTO THE GROUNDS
AND GAVE THEM A HOT DOG LUNCH.
WELL, THIS WAS A SHOCKER TO THE BRITISH,
BUT IT'S THE THING HE WOULD DO.
YOU SEE, HE WAS A NATURAL ARISTOCRAT, ROOSEVELT WAS.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT ON AIRS.
(drum beating)
Man:
AMERICAN INDIANS WERE ASKED TO DANCE AS THE ENTERTAINMENT.
HIS MOTHER THOUGHT THIS WAS A DREADFUL WAY TO ENTERTAIN
SUCH DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE, BUT ACTUALLY,
THEY HAD A MARVELOUS TIME.
HE SAT UP WITH THE KING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT,
WHOM HE CALLED GEORGE.
AND FINALLY, HE PUT HIS HAND ON HIS KNEE
AND SAID, "YOUNG MAN, IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO TO BED."
AND THE KING LATER SAID TO ONE OF THIS AIDES,
"WHY DON'T MY MINISTERS TALK TO ME THAT WAY?"
McCullough:
THE ROYAL COUPLE HAD WON AMERICAN HEARTS.
WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR THE KING AND QUEEN TO LEAVE,
ELEANOR WROTE THAT SHE "THOUGHT OF THE CLOUDS
"THAT HUNG OVER THEM
AND THE WORRIES THAT THEY WERE GOING TO FACE."
THE PRESIDENT CALLED AFTER THEM, "GOOD LUCK TO YOU!
ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD!"
THREE MONTHS LATER, GREAT BRITAIN AND GERMANY WERE AT WAR
AND F.D.R. WOULD DECIDE TO RUN FOR A THIRD TERM
AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
"F.D.R." WILL CONTINUE IN A MOMENT.
McCullough:
POLAND, DENMARK, NORWAY,
HOLLAND, LUXEMBOURG, BELGIUM, FRANCE HAD FALLEN.
SEPTEMBER 1940, GERMAN BOMBS WERE DESTROYING LONDON.
ENGLAND STOOD ALONE.
Winston Churchill:
HITLER KNOWS
THAT HE WILL HAVE TO BREAK US IN THIS ISLAND
OR LOSE THE WAR.
IF WE CAN STAND UP TO HIM, ALL EUROPE MAY BE FREE
AND THE LIFE OF THE WORLD MAY MOVE FORWARD.
BUT IF WE FAIL, THEN THE WHOLE WORLD,
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES,
INCLUDING ALL THAT WE HAVE KNOWN AND CARED FOR,
WILL SINK INTO THE ABYSS OF A NEW DARK AGE.
McCullough:
PRIME MINISTER WINSTON CHURCHILL
INSPIRED THE BRITISH PEOPLE,
BUT HE ALSO BEAMED HIS MESSAGE AT A TARGET IN AMERICA.
HE DESPERATELY NEEDED HELP FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
THE WAR WOULD BE ROOSEVELT'S FINAL TEST.
(cheering)
ON NOVEMBER 5, 1940, WITH NAZI ARMIES IN CONTROL OF EUROPE,
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WON AN UNPRECEDENTED THIRD TERM
AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THE NEXT DAY, HE RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL.
"I DID NOT THINK IT RIGHT FOR ME AS A FOREIGNER
"TO EXPRESS ANY OPINION UPON AMERICAN POLICIES
"WHILE THE ELECTION WAS ON,
BUT I PRAYED FOR YOUR SUCCESS AND I AM TRULY THANKFUL FOR IT."
MONTH AFTER MONTH, FOR OVER A YEAR,
CHURCHILL HAD BEEN SENDING SECRET MESSAGES TO ROOSEVELT.
"WE MUST ASK AS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH TO BE REINFORCED.
"IT HAS NOW BECOME MOST URGENT FOR YOU
"TO LET US HAVE THE DESTROYERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE ASKED.
"MR. PRESIDENT, WITH GREAT RESPECT, I MUST TELL YOU
"THAT IN THE LONG HISTORY OF THE WORLD,
THIS IS A THING TO DO NOW."
ROOSEVELT WANTED TO HELP.
BUT MOST AMERICANS WERE AGAINST INVOLVEMENT IN ANY WAR.
IT WOULD TAKE ALL OF F.D.R.'s POLITICAL GENIUS
TO GET CHURCHILL WHAT ENGLAND NEEDED TO SURVIVE.
WE CANNOT AND WE WILL NOT...
TELL THEM THAT THEY MUST SURRENDER
MERELY BECAUSE OF PRESENT INABILITY TO PAY
FOR THE WEAPONS WHICH WE KNOW THEY MUST HAVE.
McCullough:
CONGRESS HAD PROHIBITED ROOSEVELT FROM SENDING WEAPONS
UNLESS ENGLAND PAID IN CASH, AND ENGLAND WAS BANKRUPT.
THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE TO OUTMANEUVER THE LAWMAKERS.
Roosevelt:
I DO NOT RECOMMEND
THAT WE MAKE THEM A LOAN OF DOLLARS
WITH WHICH TO PAY FOR THESE WEAPONS.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT PROPOSED A DARING PLAN
WITH AN INNOCUOUS NAME-- LEND-LEASE.
LEND-LEASE WAS A WAY TO GIVE THE BRITISH
PLANES, TANKS, GUNS, ARTILLERY, AMMUNITION
WITHOUT THEM REALLY PAYING FOR IT.
AND REPORTERS AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ASK HIM,
"WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
WHAT DOES LEND-LEASE MEAN?"
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT EXPLAINED
THAT WE WOULD LEND ENGLAND THE WEAPONS
AND WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER, ENGLAND WOULD RETURN THEM.
IT WAS LIKE LENDING A NEIGHBOR A GARDEN HOSE
TO PUT OUT A FIRE, HE SAID.
AFTER THE FIRE WAS OUT,
THE NEIGHBOR WOULD SIMPLY RETURN THE HOSE.
Dallek:
OF COURSE IT WAS PATENT NONSENSE.
WHAT WERE THE BRITISH GOING TO DO,
GIVE US THE TANKS BACK THAT WERE BLOWN UP?
THE PLANES THAT WERE SHOT DOWN?
BUT ROOSEVELT'S INVOCATION OF THIS HOMILY
ABOUT THE NEIGHBOR AND THE GARDEN HOSE
IS A WONDERFUL WAY FOR HIM TO SELL IT TO THE PUBLIC
AND THAT WAS HIS POLITICAL GENIUS.
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HE HAD A KIND OF SIXTH SENSE FOR.
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT, YOU CAN'T DEFINE IT,
YOU CAN'T PUT IT UNDER ANY SCIENTIFIC RUBRIC,
IT SIMPLY WAS SOMETHING THAT THE MAN HAD.
McCullough:
ON MARCH 11, 1941, CONGRESS PASSED
AND ROOSEVELT SIGNED INTO LAW LEND-LEASE.
Cooke:
THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE CALLED.
THIS MORNING HE HAD SIGNED THE LEND-LEASE BILL.
A REPORTER SAID, "MR. PRESIDENT,
"HAVE YOU GOT SHIPS AND MATERIEL AND TANKS AND THINGS?
ARE THEY ALREADY LEFT THE PORTS AND CROSSING THE ATLANTIC?"
WELL, MY BRITISH SUPPLY MAN HAD TOLD ME
THAT THERE WERE CARGOES JUST ABOUT TO ARRIVE
IN LIVERPOOL AND SOUTHAMPTON.
AND ROOSEVELT LOOKED UP LIKE AN INNOCENT CHILD
AND HE SAID, "OH!"
HE SAID, "WE WORK FAST, BUT NOT THAT FAST."
AND OF COURSE IT WAS--
I MEAN, IF THEY'D KNOWN THE TRUTH, YOU KNOW,
THE WHOLE ATLANTIC WAS THICK
WITH ALL THE THINGS ALREADY ON THEIR WAY.
McCullough:
THE LEND-LEASE LIFELINE STRETCHED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.
ROOSEVELT HAD BENT THE LAW, OUTFLANKED CONGRESS
AND PROVIDED ENGLAND WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS' WORTH
OF WEAPONS AND SUPPLIES.
BUT AS THE GREAT ARMADA REACHED BRITAIN'S SHORES,
OPPOSITION REMAINED STRONG BACK IN AMERICA.
Charles Lindbergh:
THEY DARE NOT TELL US THAT THESE STEPS MEAN WAR.
THEY DARE NOT TELL US WHAT WAR MEANS.
McCullough:
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, CONSERVATIVES AND LEFTISTS ALIKE
CAMPAIGNED TO KEEP AMERICA OUT OF ANOTHER EUROPEAN WAR.
CHARLES LINDBERGH EXPRESSED THE CONCERNS
OF MANY AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
I SAY IT IS THEY
WHO ARE UNDERMINING THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY
WHEN THEY DEMAND THAT WE TAKE A COURSE
TO WHICH MORE THAN 80% OF OUR CITIZENS ARE OPPOSED.
McCullough:
IN FACT, LINDBERGH EXAGGERATED.
YET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY DIVIDED
AND ROOSEVELT, SENSING THEIR INDECISION, WAS STYMIED.
"IT'S A TERRIBLE THING," HE LATER TOLD AN AIDE,
"TO LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO LEAD
AND TO FIND NO ONE THERE."
Goodwin:
THE SPRING OF '41 SEEMS LIKE
ONE OF THE LOWEST POINTS FOR ROOSEVELT.
PUBLIC OPINION ITSELF WAS SO INCREDIBLY CONFUSED,
AND WHEN PUBLIC OPINION WAS CONFUSED
ROOSEVELT HIMSELF LOST HIS MOORINGS.
HIS GENIUS WAS THAT HE SOMEHOW COULD DIVINE
WHERE THE COUNTRY WAS AND HELP PUSH IT ALONG
MAYBE A LITTLE AHEAD OF ITSELF,
BUT HE SAW WHERE THE COUNTRY WAS HEADING.
IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME, THE COUNTRY SEEMED TO BE
IN SUCH A MAZE OF CONTRADICTIONS
THAT HE LOOKED OUT ALMOST AS IF HE WERE STARING
INTO A FOG HIMSELF.
McCullough:
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WAS ALSO AT A CROSSROADS.
NO ONE HAD FOUGHT HARDER FOR HER HUSBAND'S NEW DEAL,
BUT NOW HIS PRIORITIES HAD CHANGED.
Goodwin:
SHE HAD HAD THIS WONDERFUL DECADE
OF A PARTNERSHIP WITH HER HUSBAND,
WHERE THEY WERE BOTH MOVING TOWARD SOCIAL REFORM
AND THE NEW DEAL WAS THE CENTER OF THEIR HEARTS.
NOW SHE SEES HIM TOTALLY PREOCCUPIED BY WAR.
WHEN SHE COMES BACK FROM HER TRAVELS AROUND THE COUNTRY,
HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO TALK TO HER ANYMORE.
MY GRANDMOTHER FELT HERSELF A LITTLE BIT OFF TO THE SIDE,
LESS USEFUL...
WITH LESS REASON TO GO AND BE WITH HIM AS SHE ALWAYS WAS
EARLY IN THE MORNING OR AT THE END OF THE DAY.
SO THIS RELATIONSHIP FROM WHICH SHE DREW STRENGTH--
AND A POSITION-- NO LONGER EXISTED.
McCullough:
ALL THROUGH 1941,
THE PRESSURES ON ROOSEVELT MOUNTED.
ON ONE SIDE OF THE GLOBE
JAPAN THREATENED TO SPREAD ITS EMPIRE
THROUGHOUT THE PACIFIC.
"THEY HATE US," ROOSEVELT SAID.
"SOONER OR LATER THEY'LL COME AFTER US."
AND ACROSS THE ATLANTIC,
ROOSEVELT INCREASINGLY FEARED FOR GREAT BRITAIN'S SURVIVAL.
Curtis Roosevelt:
SOME PEOPLE THINK
THAT THIS GREAT MASTER POLITICIAN
WAS ALWAYS ON TOP OF THINGS,
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE IN RELATION TO PUBLIC OPINION
AND IT WAS A MAJOR THING.
IT REALLY GOT TO HIM.
HE WENT TO BED FOR TEN DAYS
OUT OF EXASPERATION...
FROM THE PRESSURES ON BOTH SIDES
TO INTERVENE OR NOT TO INTERVENE,
AND BRITAIN WAS GOING DOWN THE TUBE.
McCullough:
"IF GREAT BRITAIN GOES DOWN," ROOSEVELT SAID,
"ALL OF US IN ALL THE AMERICAS WOULD BE LIVING
AT THE POINT OF A GUN."
THEN, IN EARLY AUGUST,
DETERMINED TO DO MORE FOR THE BRITISH,
ROOSEVELT HEADED OUT TO SEA FOR A SECRET RENDEZVOUS
IN U-BOAT-INFESTED WATERS.
UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS, HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM REPORTERS,
BOARDED AN AMERICAN WARSHIP
AND HEADED NORTH TO MEET THE BRITISH BATTLESHIP
THE PRINCE OF WALES.
ON BOARD WAS WINSTON CHURCHILL.
THE COURSE OF THE WAR WOULD BE DETERMINED
BY THE CONVERGENCE OF THESE TWO EXTRAORDINARY PERSONALITIES.
Woman:
I WAS TOLD AS A DEATHLY SECRET
THAT THIS MEETING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR TO MY FATHER--
AND PERHAPS ALSO TO THE PRESIDENT--
THAT, OF COURSE, IT DID MATTER VERY MUCH
WHETHER THEY WOULD SEE EYE TO EYE.
McCullough:
"CHURCHILL," HIS BODYGUARD LATER REPORTED,
"WAS AS EXCITED AS A SCHOOLBOY."
AT STAKE, THE PRIME MINISTER BELIEVED,
WAS THE FATE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION.
THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO ON EDGE.
HE WAS NOT USED TO SHARING THE STAGE WITH ANY MAN,
AND CHURCHILL WAS ALREADY A LEGEND.
A ROOSEVELT AIDE WHO KNEW BOTH MEN
WORRIED ABOUT A CLASH OF PRIMA DONNAS.
("Stars and Stripes Forever" playing)
McCullough:
WITH THE NAVY BAND PLAYING "THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER,"
CHURCHILL CAME ABOARD THE AMERICAN SHIP.
"AT LAST," ROOSEVELT SAID, "WE'VE GOTTEN TOGETHER."
THEY TALKED FOR FOUR DAYS.
TWO TITANIC EGOS, EACH TAKING THE OTHER'S MEASURE.
CHURCHILL WAS DETERMINED TO BIND THE AMERICANS EVER MORE FIRMLY
TO THE BRITISH CAUSE.
ROOSEVELT WAS WARY.
HE WAS UNWILLING TO ASK CONGRESS FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR
WITHOUT THE ROCK-SOLID SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
BUT HE WAS SEARCHING FOR SOME WAY TO HELP GREAT BRITAIN
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.
Dallek:
WHAT CHURCHILL NEEDED TO DO WAS TO CONVINCE ROOSEVELT
THAT BRITAIN WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.
AND WHAT ROOSEVELT WAS SAYING TO CHURCHILL WAS,
"I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE.
"I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DANGER TO US, BOTH OF US,
"FROM ADOLF HITLER,
AND WE'RE GOING TO STAND TOGETHER AGAINST THIS MONSTER."
Pastor:
HYMN 540.
McCullough:
ON SUNDAY, ROOSEVELT WAS CARRIED
ON BOARD THE BRITISH BATTLESHIP FOR A MORNING SERVICE.
(singing hymn)
"IF NOTHING ELSE HAD HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE HERE,"
ROOSEVELT TOLD AN AIDE,
"THAT JOINT SERVICE WOULD HAVE CEMENTED US."
Soames:
ALL THE SHIPS' COMPANIES
ALL MIXED UP AND SHARING THE HYMN SHEETS AND EVERYTHING,
AND IT REALLY DID SEEM RATHER WONDERFUL AND VERY MOVING.
MY FATHER SAT WITH THE PRESIDENT.
I MEAN, NORMALLY HE WOULD HAVE STOOD DURING SUCH A SERVICE,
BUT HE AND THE PRESIDENT SAT
AND EVERYBODY ELSE STOOD ON THE QUARTERDECK.
MY FATHER CHOSE THE HYMNS VERY CAREFULLY-
- HIS FAVORITES.
♫ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS, MARCHING AS TO WAR...♫
McCullough:
"THE SAME LANGUAGE, THE SAME HYMNS,"
CHURCHILL SAID LATER.
"IT WAS A GREAT HOUR TO LIVE."
Soames:
IT WAS SORT OF LIKE A BEAM OF BRILLIANT SUNSHINE,
LIKE A GENUINE RAY OF HOPE.
AND OF COURSE, NOW IT'S...
I FIND, ANGUISHING
LOOKING AT THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS, BECAUSE THREE MONTHS LATER,
THE PRINCE OF WALES WAS UNDER THE WAVES
WITH ITS ENTIRE SHIP'S COMPANY.
McCullough:
AS THE TWO MEN PARTED, A MESSAGE FLASHED
FROM THE BRITISH BATTLESHIP TO THE AMERICAN CRUISER.
"GOD BLESS THE PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES."
WHEN CHURCHILL RETURNED TO ENGLAND, HE TOLD HIS CABINET
THAT ROOSEVELT HAD MADE A SECRET PROMISE
THAT HE WOULD WAGE WAR AGAINST NAZI GERMANY
BUT NOT DECLARE IT.
EVERYTHING WAS TO BE DONE TO FORCE AN INCIDENT.
(explosion)
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT WOULD FIND HIS INCIDENT
IN THE COLD WATERS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC.
BY THE MIDDLE OF 1941,
NAZI U-BOATS HAD SUNK OVER 1,500 BRITISH SHIPS,
ALL BUT CUTTING ENGLAND'S LIFELINE TO AMERICA.
(alarm ringing)
WITHOUT TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
ROOSEVELT ISSUED SECRET ORDERS TO THE NAVY
TO ESCORT BRITISH CONVOYS
AND, IF NECESSARY, SINK NAZI SUBMARINES.
THE PRESIDENT WAS WILLING TO RISK WAR WITH GERMANY.
Roosevelt:
On the morning of September 4, the United States destroyer Greer was attacked by a submarine-- a German submarine.
I TELL YOU THE BLUNT FACT THAT THE GERMAN SUBMARINE FIRED FIRST
UPON THIS AMERICAN DESTROYER GREER
WITHOUT WARNING AND WITH DELIBERATE DESIGN TO SINK HER.
Dallek:
WHAT HE HIDES FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS THE FACT
THAT THE GREER HAD BEEN TRACKING THE GERMAN SUBMARINE
TO HELP A BRITISH SEAPLANE,
WHICH WAS GOING TO TRY AND SINK IT WITH DEPTH CHARGES.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT KNEW
THAT THE GREER HAD DELIBERATELY STALKED THE NAZI U-BOAT
AND THAT THE BRITISH PLANE HAD FIRED FIRST.
(explosion)
"YOU KNOW I'M A JUGGLER," HE WOULD LATER TELL A FRIEND,
"AND I NEVER LET MY RIGHT HAND KNOW WHAT MY LEFT HAND DOES.
"I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO MISLEAD AND TELL UNTRUTHS
IF IT WILL HELP WIN THE WAR."
ROOSEVELT DID NOT ASK CONGRESS FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR,
BUT HE USED THE GREER INCIDENT
TO JUSTIFY AN UNDECLARED WAR IN THE ATLANTIC,
WHERE HE WAS SURE THE REAL WAR WOULD SOON BEGIN.
THAT SAME AUTUMN, WITH HER SON AT HER SIDE,
THE PRESIDENT'S MOTHER, SARA, DIED.
MINUTES AFTER HER DEATH,
THE LARGEST OAK TREE AT HYDE PARK TOPPLED TO THE GROUND.
IT WAS A CLEAR, WINDLESS DAY.
"YOU ARE CONSTANTLY IN MY THOUGHTS,"
SARA HAD TOLD HER SON TOWARD THE END, "AND ALWAYS IN MY HEART.
I THINK OF YOU NIGHT AND DAY."
Ward:
HE MANAGED TO GET THROUGH THE FUNERAL
WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN.
A FEW DAYS LATER, THOUGH, A SECRETARY BROUGHT HIM A BOX
WITH HIS MOTHER'S HANDWRITING ON IT.
HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS IN IT,
AND HE FOUND LOCKS OF HIS OWN HAIR
AND LITTLE CHILDHOOD TOYS AND HIS CHRISTENING DRESS,
EACH OF THEM CAREFULLY LABELED IN HER LOVING HAND.
AND TEARS FILLED HIS EYES
AND HE ASKED HIS SECRETARIES TO LEAVE THE ROOM.
NO ONE ON HIS STAFF HAD EVER SEEN HIM CRY BEFORE.
(song playing on radio)
Announcer:
WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM
TO BRING YOU A SPECIAL NEWS BULLETIN.
THE JAPANESE HAVE ATTACKED PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII, BY AIR,
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT HAS JUST ANNOUNCED.
McCullough:
ON DECEMBER 7, 1941, ROOSEVELT'S LONG CAMPAIGN
TO RALLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST FASCISM
CAME TO A SHOCKING AND UNEXPECTED END.
AT 1:50 P.M., THE PRESIDENT WAS TOLD
THAT THE JAPANESE HAD ATTACKED PEARL HARBOR.
AT 2:28, THE ATTACK WAS CONFIRMED.
Fields:
WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS, THEY HAD SET UP IN THE BEDROOM
AND THEY WERE TAKING COMMUNICATION
FROM WHAT WAS GOING ON.
AND PA WATSON CAME OUT AND HE HAD THIS MESSAGE
AND HE SAYS, "MR. PRESIDENT, THE WHOLE DAMN NAVY IS GONE.
WHAT IN THE HELL ARE WE GOING TO DO?"
AND PRESIDENT AND MR. HOPKINS-- HE SAID TO MR. HOPKINS,
HE SAYS, "MY GOD, MY GOD, HOW DID IT HAPPEN?"
HAD HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AT HIS DESK LIKE THIS.
HE SAYS, "HOW DID IT HAPPEN?"
HE SAYS, "NOW I'LL GO DOWN IN HISTORY DISGRACED."
McCullough:
AT A CABINET MEETING THAT NIGHT,
LABOR SECRETARY FRANCES PERKINS FOUND ROOSEVELT DEEPLY SHAKEN.
HE WAS HAVING ACTUAL PHYSICAL DIFFICULTY
IN GETTING OUT THE WORDS THAT PUT HIM ON RECORD
AS KNOWING THE NAVY WAS CAUGHT UNAWARES.
Fields:
HE LOOKED DRAWN.
HIS FACE WAS KIND OF PALISH-LIKE AND TIRED-LIKE.
AND THERE SEEMED TO BE A MAZE AROUND HIM,
JUST A BLIND SORT OF A FOG AROUND HIM.
WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM, I GOT THAT IMPRESSION FROM HIM
THAT HE WAS IN A FOG.
AND HE WAS SO DESPONDENT OVER THE FACT,
HE SAYS, "WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE."
Roosevelt:
YESTERDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1941--
A DATE WHICH WILL LIVE IN INFAMY--
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
WAS SUDDENLY AND DELIBERATELY ATTACKED
BY NAVAL AND AIR FORCES OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN.
Cooke:
THE MONDAY AFTER PEARL HARBOR WAS VERY, VERY SOLEMN.
ROOSEVELT HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE AND LOOKING BACK ON IT,
I'M ASTOUNDED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO COVER UP
THE APPALLING EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.
WE KNEW THAT THERE HAD BEEN A FEW SHIPS BOMBED.
WE HAD NO CONCEPTION
THAT THE WHOLE PACIFIC FLEET HAD BEEN BOMBED TO HELL.
ROOSEVELT SAID, "WE'VE SUFFERED GREAT LOSSES," AND SO ON,
BUT HE DIDN'T SPECIFY.
YOU WONDER THAT HE COULD EVEN SORT OF FACE ANYBODY.
SO HE HANDLED THAT WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE.
McCullough:
FOUR DAYS LATER,
GERMANY, TOO, DECLARED WAR ON AMERICA.
NOW ROOSEVELT WOULD HAVE TO WAGE WAR ON BOTH SIDES OF THE GLOBE,
ACROSS TWO OCEANS AND THREE CONTINENTS.
Gallagher:
NO MAN IN HISTORY EVER HAD A GREATER BURDEN
THAN FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT DID DURING WORLD WAR II.
HE WAS LEADING THE FREE WORLD AGAINST ADOLF HITLER,
AND IT WASN'T AT ALL CLEAR THAT WE WERE GOING TO WIN.
McCullough:
THE EARLY NEWS WAS ALL BAD.
DISASTER FOLLOWED ON DISASTER.
THE JAPANESE SWEPT THROUGH SOUTHEAST ASIA,
PUSHING THE ALLIES OUT OF MOST OF THE PACIFIC.
THE GERMANS HAD ADVANCED DEEP INTO RUSSIA,
THREATENING MOSCOW AND LENINGRAD.
JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER PEARL HARBOR, ON DECEMBER 22,
ROOSEVELT RECEIVED A SECRET VISITOR AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
Cooke:
WE WERE AT A REGULAR PRESS CONFERENCE--
ALWAYS IN THE OVAL OFFICE--
AND SO WE ALL STORMED IN
AND WERE STAGGERED TO SEE SITTING AT THE...
NEXT TO HIM IN A CHAIR
WAS THIS ROTUND, PINK, PINK WINSTON CHURCHILL.
AND THERE WAS ONE OF THOSE
SORT OF INDESCRIBABLE STRANGE NOISES
BETWEEN A RUSTLE AND A GASP AND A...
AND EVENTUALLY A CHEER
AND ROOSEVELT SAID, "MR. PRIME MINISTER,
GET UP THERE AND LET THEM SEE YOU."
SO CHURCHILL GOT UP, STOOD ON THE DESK
AND GAVE THE GREAT VICTORY SIGN.
McCullough:
THIS TIME THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENT MET
TO PLOT MILITARY STRATEGY.
THEIR MOST IMPORTANT DECISION:
WHO TO FIGHT FIRST--
THE GERMANS IN EUROPE OR THE JAPANESE IN THE PACIFIC.
FOR NEARLY A MONTH, THEY TALKED AND PLANNED.
CHURCHILL MOVED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
JUST DOWN THE HALL FROM ROOSEVELT.
THE DAILY RUB OF LIVING SIDE-BY-SIDE
WOULD TEST THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND THE FUTURE OF THE ALLIANCE.
Goodwin:
WHEN CHURCHILL CAME,
IT WAS LIKE A CYCLONE HAD HIT THE WHITE HOUSE.
HIS WHOLE SCHEDULE WAS TOTALLY OUT OF WHACK WITH ROOSEVELT'S.
HE, OF COURSE, LOVED TO STAY UP LATE AT NIGHT
DRINKING, SMOKING CIGARS,
AND ROOSEVELT WOULD SIT THERE WITH HIM
UNTIL 2:00 OR 3:00 IN THE MORNING,
DRINKING, SMOKING CIGARS.
Fields:
BEFORE BREAKFAST,
YOU WOULD POUR HIM A TUMBLER OF SHERRY
AND HE'D HAVE THAT AS HIS EYE-OPENER.
FOR LUNCH HE'D START DRINKING SCOTCH AND SODA,
AND HE'D DRINK SCOTCH AND SODA UNTIL HE'D TAKE A NAP.
AND AT DINNER HE HAD TO HAVE HIS CHAMPAGNE
AND 90-YEAR-OLD BRANDY.
THEN HE WOULD GO TO WORK.
Goodwin:
ROOSEVELT RELISHED WITH ALL PEOPLE
THE CHANCE TO BREAK THROUGH DECORUM
AND HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP.
HE WAS ALWAYS CALLING PEOPLE BY THEIR FIRST NAME
EVEN BEFORE HE KNEW THEM.
SO I THINK THAT ONCE HE ESTABLISHED WITH CHURCHILL
THIS KIND OF CRAZY, INFORMAL RELATIONSHIP,
HE KNEW THAT IT WAS A GOOD OMEN FOR THEIR FRIENDSHIP.
Soames:
ONE WILL NEVER KNOW
WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
IF THERE HADN'T BEEN WAR,
BUT MAYBE IT NEEDED A GREAT CAUSE TO BRING THEM TOGETHER
AND MAYBE IT WAS A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE,
BUT THEN A LOT OF MARRIAGES OF CONVENIENCE
ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL, AREN'T THEY?
McCullough:
BY THE END OF THE MONTH, ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL
HAD AGREED TO FIGHT THE GERMANS FIRST.
BUT IN JANUARY 1942, THE NAZIS DOMINATED MOST OF EUROPE,
AND THE ALLIES WERE STILL FAR TOO WEAK
TO INVADE THE CONTINENT.
JUST TWO YEARS EARLIER,
AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAD BEEN FORCED TO TRAIN
WITH CARDBOARD WEAPONS, FIRING FLOUR INSTEAD OF SHELLS.
ROOSEVELT HAD DONE ALL HE COULD
TO BUILD UP THE COUNTRY'S DEFENSES,
BUT HE STILL HAD A LONG WAY TO GO.
Goodwin:
THERE AREN'T EVEN PRIVATE COMPANIES
THAT ARE MAKING VERY MANY WEAPONS,
SO HE'S GOT TO TAKE COMPANIES
THAT ARE MAKING GIRDLES, CARS, ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS
AND CHANGE OVER THEIR PRODUCTION TO MAKING WEAPONS FOR WAR.
IN THIS YEAR, 1942, WE SHALL PRODUCE 60,000 PLANES...
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT BEGAN BY SETTING WAR PRODUCTION GOALS
WHICH TO MANY PEOPLE SEEMED ASTRONOMICAL.
NEXT YEAR, 1943, WE SHALL PRODUCE 125,000 AIRPLANES,
INCLUDING 100,000 COMBAT PLANES.
Nathan:
ROOSEVELT SAYS,
"WE ARE GOING TO BE THE ARSENAL FOR DEMOCRACY."
ALL THESE NUMBERS POURED OUT
AND MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE CRAZY.
HOW DO YOU PERSUADE DETROIT TO CONVERT--
SUDDENLY TO STOP MAKING THESE PROFITABLE AUTOMOBILES
AND BEGIN MAKING TANKS
WHICH SOMEHOW THEY'VE NEVER MADE, DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE,
AND WILL HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE?
IT ISN'T EASY AND IT WASN'T EASY.
EVEN THOUGH IT WILL MEAN THE DISLOCATION
OF THE LIVES AND OCCUPATIONS OF MILLIONS OF OUR OWN PEOPLE,
WE MUST RAISE OUR SIGHTS ALL ALONG THE PRODUCTION LINE.
LET NO MAN SAY IT CANNOT BE DONE.
IT MUST BE DONE AND WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DO IT.
McCullough:
AS AMERICA PREPARED FOR WAR,
ROOSEVELT WAS DETERMINED TO STRIKE AT THE NAZIS
BY INVADING ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
CHURCHILL WANTED TO WAIT.
Man:
THE AMERICAN MILITARY PLANNERS
WERE ALL FOR A CROSS-CHANNEL ASSAULT ON GERMANY
AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT.
THE BRITISH IN EFFECT SAID, "WE CAN'T DO IT."
WE-
- BEING THE ALLIES-- CAN'T DO IT.
WE DON'T HAVE THE LANDING CRAFT,
WE DON'T HAVE COMMAND OF THE AIR,
WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE SEA, AND '42 IS JUST TOO SOON.
AND ROOSEVELT'S COUNTER-ARGUMENT WAS,
"I HAVE TO SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
"THAT WE'RE MOVING AGAINST HITLER.
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING."
AND THE SOMETHING TURNED OUT TO BE OPERATION TORCH,
THE INVASION OF NORTH AFRICA.
McCullough:
ON NOVEMBER 8, 1942,
IGNORING THE ADVICE OF SOME OF HIS TOP COMMANDERS,
F.D.R. SENT AMERICAN SOLDIERS INTO COMBAT FOR THE FIRST TIME
AGAINST THE GERMAN ARMY.
MORE THAN 80,000 AMERICANS POURED OUT
OF HUNDREDS OF WARSHIPS ONTO THE NORTH AFRICAN BEACHES.
WHEN ROOSEVELT PICKED UP THE PHONE TO RECEIVE NEWS
THAT THE ASSAULT HAD BEGUN,
AN AIDE NOTICED THAT HIS HAND WAS TREMBLING.
HE LISTENED, THEN ANNOUNCED:
"WE HAVE LANDED IN NORTH AFRICA.
"CASUALTIES ARE BELOW EXPECTATIONS.
WE ARE FIGHTING BACK."
TWO MONTHS LATER, ROOSEVELT AGAIN MADE A DANGEROUS JOURNEY.
THIS TIME HE FLEW TO THE NORTH AFRICAN BATTLEFRONT.
NO AMERICAN PRESIDENT SINCE LINCOLN
HAD VISITED TROOPS IN A COMBAT ZONE.
AT CASABLANCA, HE MET WITH WINSTON CHURCHILL
TO DISCUSS ALLIED WAR PLANS.
AND AGAIN, CHURCHILL ARGUED
TO POSTPONE THE CROSS-CHANNEL INVASION
AND ROOSEVELT AGREED.
SHIPS WERE STILL IN SHORT SUPPLY.
THEN ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL SET OFF TOGETHER
FOR A BRIEF HOLIDAY ACROSS THE MOROCCAN DESERT TO MARRAKECH.
Soames:
MY FATHER SAID TO THE PRESIDENT,
"YOU CANNOT COME ALL THIS WAY AND NOT SEE THE SUN SET
OVER THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS FROM MARRAKECH."
AT THE GOLDEN HOUR,
THE PRESIDENT HAD TO BE CARRIED UP TO THE TOWER.
HE WAS DETERMINED TO SEE IT
FROM WHERE MY FATHER SAID IT SHOULD BE SEEN.
THEY SAT AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER
AND THEY WATCHED THE SUN SET OVER THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS.
MY FATHER HAD BROUGHT HIS PAINTS
AND HE PLAYED TRUANT FROM THE WAR FOR TWO DAYS,
AND HE PAINTED THE ONLY PICTURE FROM HIS BRUSH
IN THE WHOLE OF THE WAR.
AND HE LATER GAVE IT TO THE PRESIDENT
TO REMIND HIM OF THEIR, THEIR JOURNEY TO SEE THE SUNSET.
McCullough:
ALL DURING THE WAR, ROOSEVELT IN SECRET RETREATED
TO HIS HOME AT HYDE PARK, NEW YORK.
WHEN SLEEP ELUDED HIM,
HE IMAGINED HIMSELF A BOY AGAIN, HE SAID,
COASTING DOWN THE HILLS IN THE SNOW.
EACH DAY THE WAR PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT WITH TERRIBLE CHOICES,
FORCING HIM TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT WOULD HAUNT HIS REPUTATION.
WHEN HE WAS ADVISED TO SEND TO INTERNMENT CAMPS
AMERICANS WHOSE ONLY CRIME WAS THEIR JAPANESE ANCESTRY,
HE SENT THEM.
WHEN NEWS OF THE SLAUGHTER OF JEWS
IN THE GERMAN DEATH CAMPS REACHED HIM,
HE FELT HE COULD TAKE NO SPECIAL MILITARY STEPS TO RESCUE THEM.
WHEN SCIENTISTS RECOMMENDED A WEAPON MORE TERRIBLE
THAN ANY KNOWN TO MAN,
HE SECRETLY SET THEM TO WORK ON THE ATOMIC BOMB.
THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM WOULD LATER SAY
THAT ROOSEVELT HAD ONE OVERRIDING GOAL--
WINNING THE WAR.
MEANWHILE, ELEANOR ROOSEVELT HURLED HERSELF
INTO THE WAR EFFORT
WITH ALL THE ENERGY THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT TO THE NEW DEAL.
DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR, SHE TRAVELED THE WORLD,
VISITING AMERICAN SOLDIERS EVERYWHERE.
THE SECRET SERVICE GAVE HER THE CODE NAME "ROVER."
ON ONE TRIP TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC,
SHE TRAVELED 23,000 MILES
AND VISITED 400,000 SOLDIERS IN AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND
AND THE TINY ISLANDS ON THE EDGE OF THE WAR ZONE
IN THE PACIFIC.
BUT SHE NEVER GAVE UP HER SOCIAL IDEALS.
SHE CONTINUED TO INSIST TO HER HUSBAND THAT HE FIGHT THE WAR,
BUT NOT SURRENDER THE REFORMING SPIRIT OF THE NEW DEAL.
Goodwin:
SHE WANTED TO USE THE WAR
AS A WAY OF CHANGING THE COUNTRY.
BEHIND THE SCENES, DAY AFTER DAY,
SHE IS SENDING FRANKLIN MEMOS
ABOUT BLACKS GETTING INTO THE ARMED FORCES AND INTO JOBS,
DAYCARE FOR WOMEN IN THE FACTORIES,
UNIONS VERSUS BUSINESS-- SHE'S ALWAYS ON UNION'S SIDE.
SHE IS OFTEN AT CROSS PURPOSES WITH HIM, ALWAYS ARGUING
THAT THE WAR HAD TO BE A VEHICLE FOR SOCIAL REFORM.
Gurewitsch:
THERE WERE MANY TIMES THAT HE WOULD BE IRRITATED.
AND MRS. ROOSEVELT WAS...
WAS A CONSCIENCE.
IT'S NOT SO PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMEONE SAY,
"YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.
YOU SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING BETTER."
IT'S LIKE YOUR MOTHER.
Lash:
SHE CERTAINLY SOMETIMES WAS HIS HAIR SHIRT.
SHE NEEDED TO REMIND F.D.R. OF THINGS
WHICH SOMETIMES HE DIDN'T FORGET,
BUT HE WANTED TO PUSH OVER THERE WHILE HE HAD OTHER THINGS TO DO.
Goodwin:
WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO HER WAS,
"ELEANOR, I'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL.
"IF I LOOK LIKE I'M MAKING THE WAR A VEHICLE
"FOR EVEN FURTHER NEW DEAL REFORMS,
I'M GOING TO LOSE MY SUPPORT IN CONGRESS."
HE KEPT TELLING ELEANOR
THAT IF YOU TRUST IN THE MOMENTUM OF DEMOCRACY,
THE COUNTRY WILL BE CHANGED.
McCullough:
BY THE END OF THE WAR,
THE GOVERNMENT HAD PUMPED $380 BILLION INTO THE ECONOMY--
MORE THAN SIX TIMES THE AMOUNT SPENT
DURING ALL THE NEW DEAL YEARS.
EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTED A JOB NOW FOUND ONE.
THE GREAT DEPRESSION WAS FINALLY OVER.
AND WITH AMERICAN FACTORIES POURING OUT
WEAPONS AND SUPPLIES,
THE TIDE OF WAR WAS SLOWLY TURNING...
BUT AT A TERRIBLE COST.
FOR TWO YEARS, AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAD BEEN DYING
ALL OVER THE WORLD:
AT BATAAN, CORREGIDOR, ORAN, GUADALCANAL.
IN NOVEMBER 1943, ROOSEVELT FLEW TO TEHRAN, IRAN.
WITH CHURCHILL AT HIS SIDE,
HE WOULD MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME HIS OTHER ALLY--
THE SOVIET DICTATOR, JOSEPH STALIN.
THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN FIGHTING THE NAZIS
FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS,
SUFFERING MORE DEAD AND WOUNDED THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AT WAR.
STALIN PRESSURED HIS WESTERN ALLIES
TO LAUNCH THE CROSS-CHANNEL INVASION INTO EUROPE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
Elsey:
STALIN WAS SCREAMING FOR RELIEF.
THE RUSSIANS WERE IN DESPERATE SHAPE.
AND STALIN HOPED THAT AN OPENING ON THE SECOND FRONT
WOULD RELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON HIS FRONT.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT DISTRUSTED STALIN, BUT BEHIND HIS BACK,
HE MISCHIEVOUSLY CALLED HIM "UNCLE JOE."
Elsey:
ROOSEVELT FELT HE COULD CHARM THE PANTS OFF ANYONE.
HE THOUGHT IT INCLUDED UNCLE JOE,
WHICH IT MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT.
Goodwin:
WHEN HE FIRST STARTS TALKING TO STALIN,
HE KNOWS SOMEHOW THAT HIS CHARM HASN'T PENETRATED,
SO HE DECIDES TO USE CHURCHILL AS THE WAY OF REACHING STALIN.
AS SOON AS HE SAT DOWN,
HE STARTED WHISPERING TO STALIN IN A VERY INTIMATE WAY--
IN A WAY THAT CHURCHILL WOULD HAVE TO SEE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
AND THEN HE STARTED OPENLY TEASING CHURCHILL RELENTLESSLY
ABOUT HIS JOHN-BULL MANNER, HIS CIGARS, HIS HABITS, HIS CLOTHES.
STALIN LOVED THE IDEA THAT HE HAD A FRIEND NOW.
NOW IT WAS STALIN AND ROOSEVELT AGAINST CHURCHILL.
Soames:
I THINK MY FATHER WAS VERY UPSET.
THE PRESIDENT DID RATHER SHOULDER MY FATHER OUT.
I MEAN IT WAS-- I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT BETTER
THAN TWO'S COMPANY, THREE'S NONE.
McCullough:
F.D.R. BELIEVED THAT BY WINNING STALIN'S CONFIDENCE
HE COULD INFLUENCE THE SHAPE OF THE POST-WAR WORLD,
A WORLD IN WHICH ONE DAY RUSSIA WOULD REPLACE BRITAIN
AS A MAJOR POWER.
Soames:
IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN PURELY COLD, POLITICAL TERMS,
OF THE BIG THREE, MY FATHER REPRESENTED THE NATION
WHO CONTRIBUTED LEAST IN TERMS OF SOLDIERS AND GUNS AND POWER.
AND POLITICS IS ABOUT POWER.
McCullough:
THEY TALKED FOR FOUR DAYS.
WHEN ROOSEVELT TOLD STALIN
THAT THE ALLIES WOULD CROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
AND INVADE NORTHERN FRANCE IN SIX MONTHS,
STALIN WAS SATISFIED.
SO WAS ROOSEVELT.
HE HAD CONVINCED STALIN TO ENTER THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN
ONCE GERMANY WAS DEFEATED.
BY JANUARY 1944, F.D.R. HAD BEEN PRESIDENT FOR 11 YEARS.
HE WANTED TO SEE THE COUNTRY THROUGH TO VICTORY,
BUT HE ALSO HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY VISION FOR POSTWAR AMERICA.
HE SPOKE OF GUARANTEEING EVERYONE A JOB, A DECENT HOME
AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE.
HE INSISTED VETERANS GET A FREE EDUCATION
AND ACCESS TO LOW-INTEREST LOANS.
HE DESIGNED AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PEACE,
THE UNITED NATIONS.
BUT THE LONG, HARD YEARS IN OFFICE WERE BEGINNING TO SHOW.
ALTHOUGH HE WAS JUST 62 YEARS OLD,
HIS HEALTH HAD BEGUN TO FAIL.
Elsey:
BY '44, F.D.R. WAS A NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT MAN
THAN HE HAD BEEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR.
HE'D LOST A GREAT DEAL OF WEIGHT.
HIS FACE WAS THIN AND GAUNT.
HE NO LONGER CAME TO THE MAP ROOM.
HE WAS SPENDING MORE AND MORE TIME IN THE BEDROOM
OR AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, CONVALESCING.
Curtis Roosevelt:
I COULD SEE THE PHYSICAL DETERIORATION.
I MEAN, THE LEGS WERE THINNER AND YOU COULD SEE HIS FACE.
YOU COULD SENSE THAT THE VITALITY WAS EBBING.
YOU COULD SEE HIM JUST FADE AWAY.
HE WOULD COME TO THE TABLE SOMETIMES
AND HE WOULD BE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL.
BUT IF ANY AGITATION HAPPENED IN THE CONVERSATION,
HE WOULD BEGIN TO SAG
AND HE'D SORT OF DROOP AND DROP HIS HEAD
OR HE WOULD DROP HIS JAW.
Lipson:
AND I RECALL ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
WHEN HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL OUT OF HIS CHAIR
AND YOU'D HAVE TO COME IN
AND THERE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
HELPLESS ON THE FLOOR,
AND YOU'D GENTLY PICK HIM UP, SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT,
PUT HIM BACK ON THE CHAIR AND THAT WAS IT.
BUT YOUR HEART WOULD BREAK.
McCullough:
ALARMED BY THE PRESIDENT'S FAILING HEALTH,
IN MARCH 1944,
ROOSEVELT'S DOCTOR BROUGHT IN HEART SPECIALIST HOWARD BRUENN.
Bruenn:
AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT, QUESTIONS,
AND THERE WERE A FEW THINGS HE MENTIONED VERY CASUALLY
WHICH SUGGESTED THAT HE MAY BE HAVING SOME TROUBLE.
THEN I WENT OVER HIS NECK AND CHEST,
AND I WAS LITERALLY APPALLED AT WHAT I WAS FINDING--
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE,
HYPERTENSION, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
AND IF THERE'S A WEAK SPOT THERE,
IT BLOWS JUST LIKE A PIPE.
McCullough:
JUNE 6, 1944, D-DAY.
AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF WAITING,
THE CROSS-CHANNEL INVASION OF EUROPE HAD FINALLY BEGUN.
F.D.R. HAD SENT INTO ACTION 400,000 MEN
AND MORE THAN 5,000 SHIPS OF EVERY KIND.
IT WAS THE LARGEST ARMADA IN HISTORY.
THAT EVENING, THE PRESIDENT LED THE NATION IN PRAYER.
Roosevelt:
ALMIGHTY GOD, OUR SONS, PRIDE OF OUR NATION,
THIS DAY HAVE SET UPON A MIGHTY ENDEAVOR,
A STRUGGLE TO PRESERVE OUR REPUBLIC, OUR RELIGION
AND OUR CIVILIZATION
AND TO SET FREE A SUFFERING HUMANITY.
THEY WILL BE SORE TRIED, BY NIGHT AND BY DAY, WITHOUT REST
UNTIL THE VICTORY IS WON.
THE DARKNESS WILL BE RENT BY NOISE AND FLAME.
MEN'S SOULS WILL BE SHAKEN WITH THE VIOLENCES OF WAR.
SUCCESS MAY NOT COME WITH RUSHING SPEED,
BUT WE SHALL RETURN AGAIN AND AGAIN,
AND WE KNOW THAT BY THY GRACE
AND BY THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF OUR CAUSE,
OUR SONS WILL TRIUMPH.
McCullough:
WITHIN A YEAR,
THE GERMANS WOULD BE DRIVEN BACK TO BERLIN.
ROOSEVELT HAD TAKEN A WEAK, ILL-PREPARED NATION INTO BATTLE
AGAINST THE MIGHTIEST WAR MACHINE
THE WORLD HAD EVER KNOWN, BUT NOW IT WAS NO LONGER CLEAR
THAT HE WOULD LIVE TO SEE THE FINAL VICTORY.
Woman:
HE GOT THINNER.
HIS DOCTOR WAS MORE OFTEN IN ATTENDANCE.
HE NEVER SAID, "I'M SICK."
HE MIGHT SAY HE WAS TIRED,
OR HE MIGHT SAY HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO LUNCH THAT DAY,
BUT HE NEVER SAID HE WAS SICK.
THAT...
HE WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
Bruenn:
HE NEVER INQUIRED ABOUT WHAT I HAD FOUND,
WHAT WAS THE MEDICATION I WAS GIVING HIM,
AND LITERALLY HE PASSED IT OVER VERY QUIETLY.
Photographer:
MR. PRESIDENT,
WOULD YOU JUST GIVE ME ONE FULL PROFILE,
WILL YOU JUST LOOK FULL PROFILE TO YOUR LEFT, SIR?
Ward:
I THINK HE DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANY NEED
TO BROOD OVER THINGS OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL.
Roosevelt:
I CAN KEEP ON LOOKING AT HIM.
Photographer:
NO, NO, WE WANT YOU OUT HERE.
I THINK POLIO HAD TAUGHT HIM A CERTAIN FATALISM ABOUT HEALTH.
I THINK HIS FATHER'S HEART ATTACK LONG BEFORE
HAD GIVEN HIM SOME FATALISM.
I THINK IT WAS JUST, "BETTER NOT TO LOOK INTO THESE THINGS.
CARRY ON, DO YOUR DUTY, REMAIN CHEERFUL."
"THE COST OF PRODUCTION, THE STOCK ARGUMENT OF THE STARS.
"BUT CONTROL OF PRICES BY THAT MEANS IS ILLOGICAL,
"AND, WITH THE SCIENTIFIC MONEY
"AND THE PREVENTION OF COMBINES AND MONOPOLY,
PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE."
ANOTHER GREAT THOUGHT.
Man:
WHAT BOOK IS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
"AND THE POSSESSOR OF MONEY IS ENTITLED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF WORTH AS DIVIDED BY MONEY."
NOW DON'T FORGET, DIVIDED BY MONEY.
Gallagher:
AT THE END, DURING THE WAR YEARS,
WHEN HE BEGAN TO LOSE HIS MUSCLE POWER,
WHEN HE GOT SO HE COULD NO LONGER STAND WITHOUT GREAT PAIN
AND SPASMS AND THINGS,
HE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED HOW HE FELT ABOUT THAT.
HE WAS TOLD TO EAT IN HIS BED ALONE
AND NOT TO SOCIALIZE
AND TO CUT DOWN ON HIS SMOKING.
WELL, WHAT HE LOVED MOST OF ALL IN LIFE WAS THE DINNER PARTIES,
MAKING THE MARTINIS, THE CIGARETTES,
THE BADINAGE, THE CONVERSATION,
AND HE WAS REDUCED TO HAVING A MILK TOAST IN BED
AND TALKING TO GRACE TULLY, HIS SECRETARY.
AND SHE WAS A VERY NICE WOMAN,
BUT SHE WAS NO CONVERSATIONALIST.
I THINK HE WAS A VERY LONELY MAN.
ALL HIS SUPPORT SYSTEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE HAD DISSIPATED.
HIS MOTHER HAD DIED,
AND THE CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE
WITH THEIR FAMILY AND KIDS, THEY WERE ALL OFF AT WAR,
AND ELEANOR BY THAT TIME
HAD EVOLVED A SEPARATE ORBIT OF HER OWN,
AND SHE WAS TRAVELING ALL THE TIME ON THE WAR EFFORT.
Curtis Roosevelt:
I THINK F.D.R. WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MY GRANDMOTHER--
JUST AS DISAPPOINTED AS SHE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIM.
THERE WAS A LOT OF DUTY EXCHANGED
AND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER,
BUT THE LOVE, THE KIND OF INTIMACY, THE TOUCHING,
DIDN'T REALLY EXIST.
HE REALLY HAD NOBODY TO LOVE.
McCullough:
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY EARLIER, ROOSEVELT HAD FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH HIS WIFE'S SOCIAL SECRETARY, LUCY MERCER.
WHEN ELEANOR DISCOVERED THE ROMANCE,
ROOSEVELT PROMISED NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN.
NOT LONG AFTER, LUCY MARRIED A WEALTHY SOUTHERNER,
WINTHROP RUTHERFORD.
Goodwin:
IN APRIL OF 1944, AFTER ROOSEVELT HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED
WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE,
HE WAS SENT TO BERNARD BARUCH'S PLANTATION TO RECOVER,
AND IT HAPPENED THAT THE MONTH BEFORE
LUCY'S HUSBAND, WINTHROP RUTHERFORD, HAD DIED.
SO LUCY CAME TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ROOSEVELT.
IT WAS A REMINDER TO HIM
OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG BEFORE HIS POLIO,
WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE HIS BODY WAS GIVING WAY,
AS IT NOW WAS BECAUSE OF HIS HEART CONDITION,
AND HE JUST FELT SOME NEED SOMEHOW TO SEE HER MORE OFTEN.
AND THE ONLY PERSON HE COULD TRUST WITH THAT TERRIBLE TASK
OF ARRANGING LUCY'S VISITS WHEN ELEANOR WAS AWAY
WAS HIS DAUGHTER ANNA.
Curtis Roosevelt:
MY MOTHER REALIZED
THAT SHE WAS GETTING IN PERHAPS OVER HER HEAD
WITH A DIVIDED LOYALTY,
BECAUSE SHE CERTAINLY REALIZED
IF SHE'D CALLED UP MY GRANDMOTHER AND SAID,
"PA WANTS TO INVITE LUCY MERCER FOR SUPPER, OKAY?"
SHE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT THE RE... "WHAT?"
SO IT WAS DONE IN SECRET.
Goodwin:
LUCY WOULD COME TO WASHINGTON--
SHE CAME SIX DIFFERENT TIMES IN 1944 AND 1945--
AND ACCORDING TO THE USHERS' DIARIES,
ROOSEVELT WOULD GO AND PICK HER UP IN GEORGETOWN.
IT WOULD SAY IN THE DIARY, "PRESIDENT MOTORS TO GEORGETOWN
TO PICK UP MRS. RUTHERFORD,"
WHICH SEEMS TO ME ALMOST, AGAIN, A MEMORY OF A COURTSHIP.
NO ONE HAS TO PICK UP A PERSON TO COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
THEY WILL COME ON THEIR OWN ACCORD.
BUT I THINK HE WANTED TO GO AND BE IN THE CAR ALONE WITH HER,
BRING HER BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE,
AND THEN I IMAGINE IT JUST AS AN EASY DINNER.
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE PAST.
HE TOLD HER WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THE DAY.
Curtis Roosevelt:
IT WAS JUST A KIND OF CASUAL,
FUNNY CONVERSATION THAT F.D.R. FOUND RELAXING--
THAT NOBODY WAS ASKING HIM TO DO SOMETHING.
NOBODY WAS TRYING TO INFLUENCE HIM OF ONE OPINION OR ANOTHER.
Niece:
TO FEEL THE WARMTH AND LOVE OF SOMEONE--
IT'S WHAT HUMAN BEINGS LIVE FOR.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT MADE HIM CARRY ON.
IT HELPED.
Crowd (chanting):
WE WANT ROOSEVELT!
WE WANT ROOSEVELT!
WE WANT ROOSEVELT!
WE WANT ROOSEVELT!
McCullough:
IN THE FALL OF 1944,
ROOSEVELT CAMPAIGNED FOR PRESIDENT
FOR THE FOURTH TIME.
THE MOOD IN AMERICA WAS CHANGING.
THE ALLIES HAD ALREADY LIBERATED PARIS
AND HAD BEGUN TO RECAPTURE
THE ISLANDS THEY HAD LOST IN THE PACIFIC.
IN A COLD, DRENCHING RAIN,
HE CAMPAIGNED THROUGH THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY.
HURRICANE WINDS BLEW JUST OFF THE COASTLINE.
HE RODE IN AN OPEN CAR, BARING HIMSELF TO THE ELEMENTS.
HE WAS DETERMINED
TO PERSUADE AMERICAN VOTERS AND WHISPERING JOURNALISTS
THAT HE WAS NOT A SICK MAN.
(wild cheering)
IN BROOKLYN, AT EBBETS FIELD, HOME OF THE DODGERS,
HE TURNED ON THE OLD ROOSEVELT CHARM.
(crowd cheering)
YOU KNOW I COME FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
I'VE GOT TO MAKE A TERRIBLE CONFESSION TO YOU.
(cheering)
I COME FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK
AND I PRACTICED LAW IN NEW YORK CITY
BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN EBBETS FIELD BEFORE.
(crowd cheers)
I'VE ROOTED FOR THE DODGERS... (laughter)
AND I HOPE TO COME BACK HERE SOMEDAY AND SEE THEM PLAY.
(cheering)
Cooke:
HE STILL LOOKED A BOISTEROUS, BUOYANT CHARACTER,
BUT, OF COURSE, HE WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE
BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY VERY SICK.
SEE, WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
IT WAS THE BEGINNING,
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE DECLINE THROUGH THE WINTER
WAS VERY BAD INDEED.
McCullough:
IN JANUARY 1945,
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE FOR A FOURTH TIME.
I, FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES...
McCullough:
12 YEARS BEFORE, HE HAD TOLD A DESPERATE PEOPLE
THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF.
NOW, WEAK AND FRAIL,
HE STILL SPOKE WITH THE SAME CONFIDENT OPTIMISM.
Roosevelt:
THINGS IN LIFE WILL NOT ALWAYS RUN SMOOTHLY.
SOMETIMES WE WILL BE RISING TOWARD THE HEIGHTS,
THEN ALL WILL SEEM TO REVERSE ITSELF AND START DOWNWARD.
THE GREAT FACT TO REMEMBER
IS THAT THE TREND OF CIVILIZATION ITSELF
IS FOREVER UPWARD--
THAT A LINE DRAWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE PEAKS
AND THE VALLEYS OF THE CENTURIES ALWAYS HAS AN UPWARD TREND.
McCullough:
THE WAR WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE.
BERLIN LAY IN RUINS, DEVASTATED BY ALLIED BOMBS.
TOKYO, TOO, WAS BURNING FROM BOMBS DROPPED BY AMERICAN B-29s.
(excited shouting)
JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THE INAUGURATION,
ROOSEVELT TRAVELED TO YALTA, A SOVIET CITY ON THE BLACK SEA.
THERE HE MET WITH CHURCHILL AND STALIN FOR THE LAST TIME.
Dallek:
IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR TO ALL OF THEM
THAT THE WAR IN EUROPE IS COMING TO AN END.
IT MAY NOT END IN A MONTH, OR EVEN THREE MONTHS,
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT NAZI GERMANY IS NOW GOING TO BE DEFEATED
AND THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SORT OUT
WHAT THE POSTWAR WORLD AND POSTWAR EUROPE
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND STALIN
HAD BEEN UNITED IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST HITLER,
BUT NOW, WITH NAZI GERMANY CRUMBLING,
THE ALLIANCE WAS THREATENING TO COME APART.
STALIN DEMANDED CONTROL OF POLAND AFTER THE WAR.
ROOSEVELT CONVINCED HIM TO AGREE TO FREE ELECTIONS THERE,
BUT HAD FEW ILLUSIONS
THE RUSSIAN LEADER WOULD KEEP HIS WORD.
Dallek:
WHAT ROOSEVELT BELIEVED
WAS THAT STALIN AND THE SOVIETS HAD THE POWER
AND THE INFLUENCE TO CONTROL EASTERN EUROPE
AT THE END OF THE WAR.
THEY WERE THERE WITH MILLIONS OF MEN.
THEY WERE THERE WITH A HUGE, A VAST ARMY,
AND THE NOTION THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO INTO EASTERN EUROPE
TO DRIVE THEM OUT, I THINK, IS UTTER NONSENSE.
McCullough:
"I DIDN'T SAY THE AGREEMENT WAS GOOD,"
ROOSEVELT TOLD AN AIDE.
"I SAID IT WAS THE BEST I COULD DO."
TWO DAYS AFTER HIS RETURN FROM YALTA,
ROOSEVELT WENT BEFORE CONGRESS
TO REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
YES, I RETURN FROM THE TRIP REFRESHED AND INSPIRED.
THE ROOSEVELTS ARE NOT, AS YOU MAY SUSPECT, AVERSE TO TRAVEL.
WE SEEM TO, UH, THRIVE ON IT.
(laughter)
(applause breaks out)
Elsey:
WHEN HE RETURNED FROM YALTA,
HE WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO STAND UP IN THE CONGRESS,
BUT GAVE HIS SPEECH SITTING DOWN,
WHICH WAS EXTRAORDINARY FOR HIM.
HE WOULD NEVER...
HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN WILLING TO ADMIT A WEAKNESS.
I HOPE THAT YOU WILL PARDON ME
FOR AN UNUSUAL POSTURE OF SITTING DOWN
DURING THE PRESENTATION OF WHAT I WANT TO SAY.
I KNOW THAT YOU WILL REALIZE
THAT IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR ME
IN NOT HAVING TO CARRY ABOUT TEN POUNDS OF STEEL AROUND
ON THE BOTTOM OF MY LEGS
AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE FACT
THAT I HAVE JUST COMPLETED A 14,000-MILE TRIP.
(applause)
McCullough:
THIS WAS THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LONG CAREER
THAT F.D.R. PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT HE WAS CRIPPLED.
THE PRESIDENT NEEDED TO REST.
ON GOOD FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 1945,
HE RETREATED TO WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA.
Goodwin:
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PLACE AND THE PLEASURES
THAT SEEMED TO BRING HIM BACK A LITTLE BIT
AND ALLOW HIM TO FEEL, PERHAPS,
THAT HE HAD GATHERED UP ENOUGH STRENGTH
TO GO BACK TO WASHINGTON FOR THE FINAL PUSH.
BUT OF COURSE IT WAS NOT TO BE THAT WAY.
Man:
ON EASTER, THE LAST EASTER, YOU MIGHT SAY,
HE CAME TO CHURCH, AND AS HE WENT IN,
WE TURNED AND LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SHOOK OUR HEADS.
HE LOOKED HORRIBLE.
HE HAD LOST WEIGHT.
HE HAD LOST THAT SMILE.
HE HAD LOST HIS INTEREST IN LIFE,
AND IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO ANYBODY
THAT HE WAS A SICK, SICK MAN.
McCullough:
IT WAS SPRING IN GEORGIA.
AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAD CROSSED THE RHINE.
THE MARINES HAD INVADED IWO JIMA AND OKINAWA.
ALMOST EVERY DAY THE PRESIDENT EXCHANGED MESSAGES
WITH WINSTON CHURCHILL ABOUT THE SOVIETS.
"WE MUST BE FIRM," ROOSEVELT WROTE IN HIS LAST LETTER TO HIM.
FOR RELAXATION, HE ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF TWO ADMIRING COUSINS.
ON APRIL 8, ELEANOR WROTE HIM:
"I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE GAINING.
"YOU SOUNDED CHEERFUL FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST NIGHT,
"AND I HOPE YOU'LL WEIGH 170 POUNDS WHEN YOU RETURN.
DEVOTEDLY, E.R."
THE NEXT DAY, LUCY MERCER RUTHERFORD JOINED HIM.
Ward:
ON THE 11th OF APRIL,
F.D.R. DROVE LUCY TO DOWDLE'S KNOB,
WHICH WAS A FAVORITE SPOT OF HIS OVERLOOKING A LOVELY VALLEY.
AND THEY SAT IN THE LATE EVENING,
AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD
AND WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO AFTER THE WAR HAD ENDED.
THE NEXT MORNING WAS THE 12th.
THEY WERE SITTING IN HIS LITTLE COTTAGE,
WHICH WAS CALLED THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE.
LUCY BROUGHT WITH HER A RUSSIAN PAINTER, A MADAME SHOUMATOFF,
WHO WAS GOING TO DO A PORTRAIT OF F.D.R. FOR HER.
MADAME SHOUMATOFF BEGAN TO PAINT.
F.D.R. SIGNED A GOOD MANY LETTERS, HAD A LITTLE LUNCH,
AND THEN SUDDENLY DROPPED SOME PAPERS ON THE FLOOR
AND REACHED UP TO HIS FOREHEAD AND SAID,
"I HAVE A TERRIFIC HEADACHE," AND FELL UNCONSCIOUS.
Bruenn:
AND WHEN I GOT THERE,
HE WAS SLUMPED OVER THE TABLE, UNCONSCIOUS,
AND I AND HIS VALET CARRIED HIM INTO HIS BEDROOM,
WHICH WAS ON THE SAME-- JUST NEXT TO THE LIVING ROOM--
WHERE IT HAPPENED.
AND I WAS ON THE BED, GIVING HIM ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.
HE HAD STOPPED BREATHING.
IT WAS INEFFECTIVE.
AS THEY SAY, FROM THAT TIME ON HE NEVER REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.
McCullough:
AT 3:35 P.M.,
DR. BRUENN PRONOUNCED THE PRESIDENT DEAD.
ELEANOR WAS IN WASHINGTON WHEN SHE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL
ASKING HER TO RETURN TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
"I KNEW IN MY HEART
THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL HAD HAPPENED," SHE SAID.
"I GOT INTO MY CAR AND SAT WITH CLENCHED HANDS."
SHE ARRIVED IN WARM SPRINGS NEAR MIDNIGHT.
THERE SHE LEARNED THAT LUCY MERCER RUTHERFORD
HAD BEEN WITH HER HUSBAND WHEN HE DIED,
THAT HER DAUGHTER ANNA HAD ARRANGED THEIR MEETINGS.
Goodwin:
ELEANOR WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS LAYING ON HIS BED,
AND SHE WAS IN THERE FOR TEN MINUTES ALONE,
AND ONE HAS TO IMAGINE HER LOOKING AT HIS FACE
AND ABSORBING WHAT SHE MUST FEEL
AS THIS TERRIBLE ACT OF BETRAYAL,
NOT ONLY BY HER HUSBAND, WHO HAD PROMISED HER
HE WOULD NEVER SEE LUCY AGAIN, BUT ALSO BY HER DAUGHTER.
SOMEHOW SHE WAS ABLE TO PULL HERSELF TOGETHER
IN THAT TEN-MINUTE SPAN
SO THAT ALL THOSE CONFLICTING EMOTIONS
WERE PULLED INSIDE OF HER
SO THAT WHEN SHE EMERGED FROM THE ROOM, SHE STILL STOOD TALL,
SIMPLY MRS. ROOSEVELT GOING FORWARD WITH HER PUBLIC DUTIES.
Bruenn:
WE TOOK HIM BACK TO WASHINGTON ON A TRAIN.
IT WAS THE MOST MOVING THING I CAN RECALL.
PEOPLE LINED THE RAILROAD TRACKS FOR MILES-- 100 MILES--
SOBBING, CRYING.
Goodwin:
AS ELEANOR LOOKED OUT ON THE FACES OF HER COUNTRYMEN,
SLOWLY SHE BEGINS TO FEEL HOW MUCH ALL THESE PEOPLE--
BLACKS, POOR PEOPLE, MIGRANT WORKERS, LABOR PEOPLE, WOMEN--
LOVED HER HUSBAND.
THEY TELL HER, "WE LOVED HIM;
HE MADE OUR LIVES DIFFERENT,"
AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT INSIDE HER HEART
THE FACES OF ALL THESE PEOPLE TOUCHED HER SOMEHOW,
AND SOMEHOW THAT BEGAN TO SOFTEN HER.
Eleanor Roosevelt:
I LAY IN MY BERTH ALL NIGHT
WITH THE WINDOW SHADE UP,
LOOKING OUT AT THE COUNTRYSIDE FRANKLIN HAD LOVED.
I WAS TRULY SURPRISED BY THE PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY.
I HAD NEVER REALIZED THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR DEVOTION TO HIM
UNTIL HE DIED.

McCullough:
ON APRIL 15, 1945, AT HYDE PARK, NEW YORK,
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT WAS LAID TO REST
IN THE CENTER OF HIS MOTHER'S GARDEN,
WHERE HE HAD PLAYED AS A BOY.
(guns firing salute)
NOTHING MUCH HAD CHANGED AT HYDE PARK DURING F.D.R.'s 63 YEARS,
BUT THE WORLD OUTSIDE HAD CHANGED BEYOND IMAGINING.
AS HE LED THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION
AND A WORLD WAR,
F.D.R. TRANSFORMED THE PRESIDENCY
AND THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT.
NOW AMERICA WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THE CENTER OF THE WORLD STAGE,
THE MOST POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS NATION ON EARTH.
BUT ABOVE ALL, F.D.R.'s OPTIMISM INSPIRED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
TO BELIEVE THEY COULD ACCOMPLISH
ANYTHING THEY SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH.
IN 1946, WINSTON CHURCHILL MADE A VISIT TO HIS FRIEND'S GRAVE.
"MEETING ROOSEVELT," CHURCHILL SAID,
"WAS LIKE UNCORKING YOUR FIRST BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE."
(theme music playing)
(train whistle blows)
(whistle blows)
Narrator:
IN 1944, A LITTLE-KNOWN SENATOR FROM MISSOURI
WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE OFFICE OF VICE-PRESIDENT.
NEW ORLEANS, HOUSTON, PORTLAND, SEATTLE, BOSTON, NEW YORK CITY,
WASHINGTON, PITTSBURGH, ST.
LOUIS.
HE CRISSCROSSED AMERICA.
ONE NIGHT, IN HIS PRIVATE PULLMAN CAR,
HE AWOKE IN A COLD SWEAT.
HE HAD DREAMED THAT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT HAD DIED
AND HE, HARRY TRUMAN, WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
IN ALL HIS LIFE, TRUMAN TOLD A REPORTER,
HE HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A TERRIFYING NIGHTMARE.
Narrator:
APRIL 12, 1945.
VICE-PRESIDENT HARRY S. TRUMAN RECEIVED A CALL
URGING HIM TO COME QUICKLY AND QUIETLY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
AS HE RAN THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF THE CAPITOL,
HE REFUSED TO FACE WHAT LAY AHEAD.
"I THOUGHT I WAS GOING DOWN THERE TO MEET THE PRESIDENT,"
TRUMAN SAID LATER.
"I DIDN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK ANYTHING ELSE."
AT 5:25 P.M., TRUMAN ENTERED THE FIRST LADY'S SECOND-FLOOR STUDY.
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT PUT HER ARM AROUND HIS SHOULDER.
"HARRY," SHE TOLD HIM, "THE PRESIDENT IS DEAD."
"IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU?" TRUMAN ASKED.
"IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR YOU?" MRS. ROOSEVELT REPLIED,
"FOR YOU ARE THE ONE IN TROUBLE NOW."
HE WAS ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE,
A FARMER UNTIL HE WAS 33,
A HABERDASHER GONE BANKRUPT AT 38.
NO ONE IN WASHINGTON HAD EVEN HEARD OF HARRY TRUMAN
BEFORE HE WAS 50.
NOW, AT 60, HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Man:
HERE WAS A LITTLE HABERDASHER FROM MISSOURI--
A SMALL BUSINESSMAN.
FOR HIM TO STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE GREAT F.D.R.,
THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS FEELING OF LETDOWN.
McCullough:
FOR MANY PEOPLE,
IT WAS AS IF THE PRESIDENCY HAD DIED,
NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT.
PEOPLE WERE SHAKEN, NOT JUST BY ROOSEVELT'S DEATH,
BUT WHAT DID THIS MEAN TO HAVE THIS UNKNOWN QUANTITY
STEP INTO SUCH A POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT POSITION?
Narrator:
"IF HARRY TRUMAN CAN BE PRESIDENT,"
AMERICANS EVERYWHERE WERE SAYING,
"SO COULD MY NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR."
Truman:
OUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY.
THE CAUSE WHICH CLAIMED ROOSEVELT ALSO CLAIMS US.
HE NEVER FALTERED, NOR WILL WE.
Man:
I FELT THAT THE MAN WAS OUT OF HIS ELEMENT,
AND I THINK MANY OTHER AMERICANS EXPRESSED THE SAME FEAR:
"WE'VE GOT AN INCOMPETENT THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
IN THE WHITE HOUSE."
IT WAS A KIND OF FRIGHTENING THING TO CONTEMPLATE.
Narrator:
OF ALL THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN PRESIDENT,
HE WAS ONE OF THE LEAST PREPARED.
VICE-PRESIDENT FOR ONLY 82 DAYS,
EXCLUDED FROM ROOSEVELT'S INNER CIRCLE, HE KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT THE WAR RAGING ACROSS THREE CONTINENTS AND TWO OCEANS
EXCEPT WHAT HE READ IN THE PAPERS.
BUT WITHIN FOUR MONTHS,
HARRY S. TRUMAN WOULD HAVE AT HIS COMMAND
THE MOST TERRIBLE WEAPON EVER DEVISED BY MAN
AND HE WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE IT.
(thunderous explosion)
(scales being played on piano)
(rooster crows)
Narrator:
"NOW, HARRY, YOU BE GOOD,"
MARTHA TRUMAN HAD TOLD HER 11-YEAR-OLD SON.
AND HARRY TRUMAN HAD WANTED TO BE GOOD.
HE DREAMED OF BECOMING A CONCERT PIANIST
AND PRACTICED WITH THE SAME DETERMINED, OPTIMISTIC SPIRIT
HIS PIONEER GRANDPARENTS BROUGHT WITH THEM
WHEN THEY FIRST CAME WEST TO MISSOURI.
BORN ON MAY 8, 1884, IN LAMAR,
HARRY WAS SIX WHEN HIS FAMILY SETTLED IN INDEPENDENCE,
A TOWN STILL CLOSE
TO THE RUGGED LIFE OF THE AMERICAN FRONTIER.
MEN CARRIED KNIVES OR GUNS.
FISTFIGHTS WERE COMMON.
INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI, WAS NOT A PLACE
WHERE YOUNG BOYS PLAYED THE PIANO.
Man:
HE'S THIS YOUNG KID WHO LOOKS SORT OF LIKE A SISSY.
THERE'S A SURVIVING PICTURE OF HIM
THAT WAS MADE AROUND THE TIME HE WAS 11.
YOU SEE THIS KID WHO LOOKS SORT OF LIKE LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY,
DRESSED UP IN HIS SUNDAY BEST, SORT OF PUDGY,
WEARING THESE BIG, THICK GLASSES,
IN A DAY WHEN IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL
FOR A KID TO WEAR EYEGLASSES.
Narrator:
"THE POPULAR BOYS WERE THE ONES WHO WERE GOOD AT GAMES
AND HAD BIG, TIGHT FISTS," TRUMAN REMEMBERED YEARS LATER.
"I WAS NEVER LIKE THAT.
"WITHOUT MY GLASSES, I WAS BLIND AS A BAT
"AND, TO TELL THE TRUTH, I WAS KIND OF A SISSY.
"IF THERE WAS ANY DANGER OF GETTING INTO A FIGHT,
I ALWAYS RAN."
BUT IN SPITE OF THE TEASING, HARRY KEPT ON PLAYING THE PIANO.
ALL HIS LIFE, HARRY TRUMAN WOULD SHOW
THE SAME DOGGED PERSEVERANCE.
McCullough:
THERE WAS THAT LITTLE BOY,
UP EVERY MORNING AT 5:00,
FOR TWO HOURS IN ABSOLUTE EARNEST BEFORE GOING TO SCHOOL
SITTING THERE IN THE HALF-LIGHT
WORKING AWAY AT MOZART OR CHOPIN.
Narrator:
IT WAS HARRY'S MOTHER
WHO FIRST URGED HIM TO PLAY THE PIANO
AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO PRACTICE.
"HARRY WAS THE SORT OF BOY," A FRIEND RECALLED,
"WHO SEEMED TO DO WHATEVER HIS MOTHER TOLD HIM."
THE DAUGHTER OF A PIONEER FARMER,
MARTHA TRUMAN HAD GONE TO COLLEGE
AND STUDIED MUSIC, ART AND LITERATURE.
BEFORE HARRY WAS FIVE, SHE SAT HIM ON HER LAP
AND TAUGHT HIM TO READ FROM THE FAMILY BIBLE.
Man:
I THINK HARRY'S MOTHER
WANTED HIM TO BE A REAL GENTLEMAN
AND DO THINGS JUST RIGHT.
SHE ACTUALLY BABIED HARRY A GOOD DEAL,
IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT, BUT SHE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T DO THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE WITH THE OTHER KIDS.
Narrator:
HARRY'S INTRODUCTION TO POLITICS WAS ROWDY AND BOISTEROUS.
ELECTION DAY AT THE END OF THE 19th CENTURY
WAS MARKED BY HIGH SPIRITS, CAROUSING AND BRAWLS.
AND IN INDEPENDENCE, HARRY'S FATHER, JOHN TRUMAN,
WAS ALWAYS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACTION.
McCullough:
HIS FATHER WAS ABOUT FIVE-FOOT-FOUR OR SO, BUT TOUGH.
HE WOULD FIGHT AT THE DROP OF A HAT.
HE WOULD TAKE AFTER PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY ON ELECTION DAY,
AND ONCE WHEN A MAN IN A COURTROOM
ACCUSED HIM OF BEING A LIAR,
HE CHASED THE FELLOW OUT INTO THE STREET
AND THREATENED TO BEAT HIM UP.
Narrator:
LIKE HARRY'S MOTHER,
JOHN TRUMAN ALSO CAME FROM PIONEER STOCK.
HE EARNED HIS LIVING TRADING HORSES AND MULES.
"A FIERY FELLOW," PEOPLE SAID OF HIM.
"VERY STUBBORN, BUT ON THE SQUARE.
"A MAN OF HIS INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY,
YOU EXCUSE A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS."
ALL HIS LIFE, HARRY WOULD TRY TO EARN JOHN TRUMAN'S RESPECT.
McCullough:
ONCE HIS FATHER GOT YOUNG HARRY A PONY,
AND THE FATHER WAS LEADING THE PONY
AND THE LITTLE BOY FELL OFF THE PONY AND STARTED TO CRY.
AND THE FATHER SAID, "ANY LITTLE BOY THAT CRIES
WHEN HE FALLS OFF THE PONY HAS TO WALK HOME."
SO HE HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY BACK.
AND MRS. TRUMAN, HARRY'S MOTHER, DIDN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL.
Narrator:
"MAMA THOUGHT I WAS BADLY MISTREATED, BUT I WASN'T,"
TRUMAN REMEMBERED.
"IN SPITE OF MY CRYING ALL THE WAY HOME,
I LEARNED A LESSON."
HARRY LEARNED THAT A MAN KEPT TRYING UNTIL HE SUCCEEDED,
THAT A MAN NEVER ADMITTED HE WAS AFRAID,
THAT A MAN HAD TO SPEAK BLUNTLY AND BE PREPARED TO FIGHT.
BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIED,
HARRY COULD NEVER QUITE MEASURE UP.
Hamby:
MY OWN IMPRESSION IS
THAT HE REALLY WANTED TO RELATE TO HIS FATHER.
HE FELT THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT AS GOOD
AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
IT WAS NOT AS CLOSE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
Narrator:
HARRY WAS NOT HIS FATHER'S FAVORITE.
HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, JOHN VIVIAN, WAS.
JOHN VIVIAN SHARED HIS FATHER'S INTEREST
IN TRADING HORSES AND MULES.
HARRY PREFERRED TO READ.
HARRY WAS ONE OF THE FEW BOYS IN TOWN WHO WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL.
MOST OF THE STUDENTS IN HIS CLASS WERE GIRLS.
(playing waltz)
HE SPENT HIS SPARE TIME GOING TO CONCERTS
WHEN HE WASN'T DEVOURING BOOKS.
McCullough:
HE CLAIMED TO HAVE READ
EVERY BOOK IN THE LITTLE TOWN LIBRARY.
HE PARTICULARLY LIKED BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY--
GEORGE WASHINGTON, ANDREW JACKSON AND ROBERT E. LEE.
THEY WERE HIS HEROES AND HE WANTED TO BE LIKE THEY WERE.
Narrator:
EVERYTHING HE LEARNED REINFORCED HIS NATIVE OPTIMISM
AND TAUGHT HIM TO ADMIRE THE SIMPLE, OLD-FASHIONED VIRTUES.
"A TRUE HEART, A STRONG MIND AND A GREAT DEAL OF COURAGE,"
HE WROTE IN A SCHOOL COMPOSITION,
"AND I THINK A MAN WILL GET THROUGH THE WORLD."
McCullough:
TRUMAN GREW UP IN A TOWN
WHERE THERE WERE CERTAIN STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR.
SELFISHNESS IS NOT TOLERATED.
HYPOCRISY IS DETESTED.
YOU WERE PUT DOWN IF YOU STARTED ACTING
A LITTLE TOO BIG FOR YOUR BRITCHES,
AND YOU JUDGE PEOPLE BY THE WORK THEY DO-
- DOING A GOOD JOB.
Narrator:
"INDEPENDENCE," HARRY SAID,
"WAS A PLACE WHERE RIGHT WAS RIGHT AND WRONG WAS WRONG
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT."
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, TRUMAN WOULD IDEALIZE HIS HOMETOWN.
BUT INDEPENDENCE WAS ALSO A PLACE
WHERE CATHOLICS AND JEWS WERE NOT TO BE TRUSTED,
ITALIANS AND IRISH NOT TO BE HIRED.
BLACKS LIVED IN A CLUSTER OF SHACKS CALLED "NIGGER NECK."
McCullough:
INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI,
WAS MORE LIKE THE SOUTH THAN IT WAS LIKE THE MIDWEST.
IT WAS A JIM CROW TOWN.
WHEN THE CIVIL WAR VETERANS
GATHERED ON THE TOWN SQUARE FOR REUNIONS,
THEY WERE CONFEDERATE VETERANS.
AND TRUMAN GREW UP IN A FAMILY WHERE RACIAL SLURS WERE USED,
WHERE OLD HABITS OF THE MIND AND THE MOUTH PREVAILED.
HARRY'S GRANDMOTHER ESPECIALLY JUST HATED ABE LINCOLN.
HARRY'S MOTHER DIDN'T FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT ABE LINCOLN, EITHER.
HER BIG HERO WAS ROBERT E. LEE.
AND YOU GET THE IMPRESSION
FROM WHAT YOU LEARN ABOUT TRUMAN'S MOTHER THAT, UH...
SHE THOUGHT JOHN WILKES BOOTH WAS A GREAT MAN.
Narrator:
HARRY BEGAN LIFE WITH ALL THE PREJUDICES OF HIS FAMILY
AND MOST OF HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.
THE BEST AND WORST OF SMALL TOWN AMERICA
HELPED SHAPE HIS MORAL IMAGINATION.
IN 1900, HARRY AND HIS FATHER WENT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION IN KANSAS CITY.
JOHN TRUMAN WAS A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT
WHO PASSED HIS STAUNCH PARTY CONVICTIONS ALONG TO HIS SON.
IT WAS THE 16-YEAR-OLD BOY'S FIRST TASTE OF NATIONAL POLITICS
AND HE LOVED IT.
THE CROWDS, THE HOOPLA, AND AS THE NEW CENTURY BEGAN,
THE SPIRIT OF OPTIMISM THAT FILLED THE AIR--
THE DREAMS OF BETTER AND BETTER TIMES AHEAD.
JOHN TRUMAN HAD HIS OWN DREAMS.
FIERCELY AMBITIOUS, ALWAYS ATTRACTED TO THE BIG SCORE,
HE BEGAN SPECULATING IN GRAIN FUTURES.
Hamby:
HE WANTED TO GET RICH.
HE THOUGHT YOU HAD TO WORK HARD.
HE WAS AN ENORMOUSLY HARD WORKER,
BUT HE THOUGHT THAT YOU NEEDED SOME LUCK IN ORDER TO GET RICH.
AND HE BET THE FAMILY SAVINGS,
AND INDEED EVENTUALLY THE FAMILY HOME IN INDEPENDENCE,
ON THE GRAIN MARKETS.
Narrator:
"YOUTH, THE HOPE OF THE WORLD,"
READ THE LATIN SLOGAN ABOVE THE HEADS
OF HARRY TRUMAN'S 1901 HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATING CLASS.
BUT NOW, AT 17, HARRY'S OWN HOPES WERE SHATTERED.
HE HAD WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE,
BUT HIS FATHER'S GAMBLE ON THE GRAIN MARKETS PROVED DISASTROUS
AND THE TRUMANS LOST EVERYTHING THEY OWNED.
BUT HARRY NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT HIS LUCK.
HE NEVER WOULD.
DETERMINED TO HELP SUPPORT HIS FAMILY,
HE HEADED FOR NEARBY KANSAS CITY.
(old-time jazz playing)
Narrator:
FOR A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY JUST STARTING OUT IN LIFE,
KANSAS CITY WAS BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES.
McCullough:
IT'S A BIG, ROUGH, BOISTEROUS, OVERGROWN COW TOWN.
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING, INCLUDING LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR SIN
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.
PROSTITUTION, GAMBLING
AND WIDE-OPEN, ALL-NIGHT HELL-RAISING.
TO WHAT EXTENT HARRY EXPERIENCED ANY OF THAT
WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
MY SUSPICION IS NOT AT ALL.
HE WAS A GOOD BOY.
Babcock:
HARRY WAS A NICE GUY
AND HIS MOTHER HAD RAISED HIM VERY WELL.
I DON'T THINK HE WAS ABOUT TO GET IN TROUBLE IN KANSAS CITY,
EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE DID IN THOSE DAYS, YOU KNOW.
HARRY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, SO HE WORKED ALL THE TIME
SO HE COULDN'T GET IN VERY MUCH TROUBLE THAT WAY,
BECAUSE HIS TIME WAS SPENT WORKING.
Narrator:
MAILROOM BOY FOR A NEWSPAPER...
TIMEKEEPER FOR A RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION COMPANY...
BANK CLERK.
HARRY TOOK WHAT JOBS CAME HIS WAY AND MADE THE MOST OF THEM.
"KANSAS CITY," HARRY REPORTED, "WAS A PLACE WITH THINGS DOING."
HE WENT TO CONCERTS, THEATER AND VAUDEVILLE,
SAW THE FOUR COHANS AND SARAH BERNHARDT.
ONCE HE HEARD THEODORE ROOSEVELT SPEAK
FROM THE BACK OF A RAILROAD CAR.
"THE PRESIDENT," HARRY THOUGHT,
"APPEARED TO BE SURPRISINGLY SHORT."
HE JOINED THE NATIONAL GUARD
AND ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF OTHER YOUNG MEN.
WOMEN, THOUGH, WERE ANOTHER MATTER.
"I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF GIRLS," HE ONCE WROTE.
AFTER FOUR YEARS,
HARRY WAS DRAWING A GOOD SALARY AS A BANK CLERK
AND FINDING NEW FRIENDS.
HE WAS 21 YEARS OLD,
JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE A LIFE FOR HIMSELF
WHEN, ONCE AGAIN, HIS FATHER THWARTED HIS AMBITIONS.
DOWN ON HIS LUCK, JOHN TRUMAN HAD BEEN FORCED TO SELL
HIS HOUSE, ALL HIS LIVESTOCK
AND HAD EVEN TAKEN A JOB AS A NIGHT WATCHMAN.
HE SAW HIS CHANCE TO GET BACK ON HIS FEET
WHEN HIS WIFE'S MOTHER ASKED HIM TO TAKE OVER THE FAMILY FARM 15 MILES SOUTH OF INDEPENDENCE.
BUT HE KNEW HE COULDN'T RUN THE HUGE 600-ACRE FARM
WITHOUT THE HELP OF BOTH HIS SONS.
HE TOLD HARRY TO QUIT HIS JOB AND COME HOME.
AGAIN, WITHOUT COMPLAINT, HARRY DID AS HE WAS TOLD.
Babcock:
I DON'T THINK HE WAS BY NATURE A FARMER.
I THINK HE LIKED PEOPLE BETTER, SO IT WAS TOUGH ON HIM.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, I'M SURE.
McCullough:
IT WAS HARD WORK-- HARD, HARD WORK--
AND BLISTERING HEAT IN THE SUMMERTIME IN WESTERN MISSOURI
AND COLD, COLD WINTERS, WHERE THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE TURNED IRON.
AND HE'D NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, THIS WAS NEW TO HIM.
HE'D GROWN UP IN TOWN, HE'D GONE TO WORK IN THE BANK.
HE'D HAD CLERKS' JOBS;
HE LOOKED LIKE A CLERK.
Hamby:
HE REMEMBERED IN LATER YEARS
THE FRIENDS WHO TOLD HIM HE WOULDN'T LAST SIX MONTHS
AND HE'D BE BACK AT WORK AT THE BANK.
Narrator:
JOHN TRUMAN WAS A STERN TASKMASTER.
"IF A CROOKED ROW OR A BLANK SPACE SHOWED
IN THE CORNFIELD OR WHEAT," HARRY REMEMBERED,
"I'D HEAR ABOUT IT FOR A YEAR."
Hamby:
HE'S WORKING FOR HIS FATHER,
AND WORKING FOR JOHN TRUMAN WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY.
BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO PROVE HE COULD DO IT.
I THINK HE WAS STILL DISSATISFIED
WITH HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER
AND THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
THIS WAS HIS LAST OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR IT.
Narrator:
FOR NEARLY EIGHT YEARS, HARRY WORKED
AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE.
"WE WERE REAL PARTNERS," HARRY REMEMBERED.
"HE THOUGHT I WAS ABOUT RIGHT.
I KNEW HE WAS."
"DEAR BESSIE, I'VE BEEN SOWING OATS ALL WEEK
"AND HAULED ABOUT SIX TONS OF HAY YESTERDAY.
"YOU KNOW, THE WIND BLEW SOMETHING FIERCE
"LAST TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY
"AND THE SUN ALSO HAD SOME EFFECT.
BETWEEN THEM, I LOOK LIKE RAW BEEF."
TO ESCAPE THE DRUDGERY OF HIS DAILY LIFE,
HARRY STOLE TIME TO WRITE
A YOUNG WOMAN FROM HIS HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATING CLASS,
ELIZABETH WALLACE-- "BESS."
Woman:
THE STORY HE TELLS...
THEY WERE IN SUNDAY SCHOOL TOGETHER
WHEN THEY WERE SIX YEARS OLD.
THERE WAS A YEAR'S DIFFERENCE IN THEIR AGE
AND HE, FROM THAT MOMENT ON, HE THOUGHT OF NO ONE ELSE
BUT THAT BLUE-EYED, GOLDEN-HAIRED LITTLE GIRL.
Narrator:
IT TOOK FIVE YEARS, HARRY SAID,
BEFORE HE COULD SUMMON THE COURAGE EVEN TO TALK TO HER.
HE WOULD REMAIN IN AWE OF BESS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
BESS WAS POPULAR, OUTGOING AND A GREAT ATHLETE,
A SUPERB TENNIS PLAYER, THE BEST FEMALE FENCER IN TOWN
AND A TERRIFIC THIRD BASEMAN.
Gentry:
SHE BELONGED TO A SPECIAL FAMILY IN INDEPENDENCE--
A FAMILY THAT WAS PROMINENT AND RECOGNIZED.
AND, OF COURSE, HARRY CAME...
WAS FROM A FARM FAMILY.
McCullough:
BESS WALLACE AND HER FAMILY LIVED
IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST HOUSES IN INDEPENDENCE.
THEY HAD A SERVANT TO WAIT ON THE TABLE.
THERE WERE LACE CURTAINS IN THE WINDOWS
AND BRUSSELS CARPETS ON THE FLOOR.
AND YOU WALKED UP THOSE STEPS ONTO THE WALLACE FRONT PORCH
AND YOU RANG THE DOORBELL
AND WHEN YOU CROSSED THE THRESHOLD INTO THAT HOUSE,
IF YOU WERE HARRY TRUMAN,
YOU WERE STEPPING INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD
WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T WORK WITH THEIR HANDS;
WHERE, TO ALL THAT HE KNEW, AT LEAST,
THEY HAD NO SUCH THING AS DEBT OR WORRY
OR CONCERN ABOUT WEATHER AND INSECTS AND ALL THE...
ALL THE BURDENS OF FARM LIFE.
AND HE COURTED HER WITH A DETERMINATION
THAT IS VERY EXPRESSIVE OF THE KIND OF MAN HE WAS.
IT WAS HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN, AND HE DIDN'T GIVE UP.
Narrator:
HE WROTE HER LETTER AFTER LETTER, DAY AFTER DAY.
"DEAR BESSIE, I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF PAPER YOU WRITE ON.
"I SHOULD BE JUST AS PLEASED TO GET A LETTER FROM YOU
ON WRAPPING PAPER..."
"DEAR BESSIE, YOU CERTAINLY DID WRITE ME ONE FINE LETTER.
"PUT THE EMPHASIS ON 'FINE' NOT ON 'ONE'
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL FINE."
"DEAR BESS, I SHALL SURE BE GLAD
"TO GO TO SALISBURY'S FOR DINNER SUNDAY,
BUT DON'T THINK I'M A TERRIBLE TIGHTWAD IF WE WALK."
HARRY WAS IN LOVE, BUT BESS HELD HERSELF ALOOF.
Gentry:
SHE HAD LOTS OF BEAUX
AND HER MOTHER ALWAYS THOUGHT--
SO I'M TOLD--
THAT BESS COULD DO BETTER THAN HARRY, A FARM BOY.
I ONCE ASKED MAY WALLACE, HARRY TRUMAN'S SISTER-IN-LAW,
IF IT WAS TRUE THAT MRS. WALLACE--
HER MOTHER-IN-LAW, MADGE WALLACE--
DIDN'T THINK THAT HARRY WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BESS.
AND SHE SAID, "OH, YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
"SHE DIDN'T THINK HARRY WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BESS.
BUT SHE DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BESS."
Narrator:
MADGE WALLACE WOULD NEVER THINK
HARRY WAS GOOD ENOUGH.
ONCE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL FROM A MUCH-ADMIRED FAMILY,
SHE HAD BECOME A RECLUSIVE, TROUBLED WOMAN
GROWN MORE AND MORE DEPENDENT ON HER ONLY DAUGHTER
EVER SINCE THE TRAGIC DEATH OF HER HUSBAND.
(distant gunshot)
Hamby:
PRECISELY WHY DAVID WALLACE GOT UP
VERY EARLY ONE MORNING, CLIMBED INTO THE FAMILY BATHTUB,
PUT A GUN TO HIS HEAD AND PULLED THE TRIGGER
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.
SOME ACCOUNTS HAVE IT HE WAS DEPRESSED
BECAUSE HE WAS HEAVILY IN DEBT,
BUT WHY WOULD SUCH A FINE MAN DO THIS?
McCullough:
BESS'S FATHER WAS AN EXTREMELY POPULAR, CHARMING MAN,
WHO OFTEN RODE THE HORSE AT THE HEAD OF POLITICAL PARADES,
BUT HE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC
AND, LIKE THE CHARACTER IN THE POEM, RICHARD COREY,
HE WENT HOME ONE NIGHT AND PUT A BULLET THROUGH HIS HEAD.
AND HIS WIFE, BESS'S MOTHER, CAME APART.
SHE NEVER WAS ABLE TO COPE AGAIN.
Narrator:
HER HUSBAND'S SUICIDE SCANDALIZED THE SMALL TOWN.
"MADGE WALLACE BECAME," SOMEONE SAID, "A PRISONER OF SHAME."
Hamby:
IT CAST A PALL OVER THE REST OF HER LIFE.
MRS. WALLACE GAVE BESS THE IMPRESSION
THAT IT WAS BESS'S DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF HER.
HER MOTHER BECAME VERY RELIANT ON HER.
Narrator:
BESS WAS JUST 18.
A NEIGHBOR REMEMBERED HOW,
IN THE HOURS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING HER FATHER'S SUICIDE,
BESS WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN IN BACK OF THE HOUSE
WITH CLENCHED FISTS.
"DEAR BESSIE, I CERTAINLY ENJOYED MYSELF
"THE EVENING I WAS THERE,
"AND YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL REPEAT THE OFFENSE
"AS OFTEN AS I CAN, OR YOU WILL ALLOW ME.
"THE CAKE AND COFFEE COULDN'T BE BEAT.
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN CAKE BUT MORE CAKE."
BESS WAS 25 WHEN HARRY FIRST BEGAN TO COURT HER.
SHE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN ON THE VERGE OF SPINSTERHOOD,
THE BONDS FORGED BY MATERNAL NEED AND FILIAL DUTY
DRAWING EVER MORE TIGHTLY AROUND HER.
BUT HARRY IDOLIZED HER.
ALL THROUGH ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL
HE HAD SHYLY LOVED HER FROM AFAR.
EVEN AS A YOUNG MAN IN KANSAS CITY
HE HAD DREAMED ALWAYS AND ONLY OF BESS.
NOW HE WAS 26, AND HE HAD NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND.
Hamby:
TRUMAN, FROM THE TIME HE WAS A KID,
HAD ALWAYS BEEN SOMEWHAT UNEASY WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX.
MAYBE BESS'S DISTANCE AND HIS IDEALIZATION OF HER
PROVIDED AN EXCUSE FOR NOT GETTING INVOLVED WITH WOMEN
FOR...
FOR A LONG TIME.
HE'S BEEN HOOKED ON THIS WOMAN
EVER SINCE HE MET HER AT THE AGE OF FIVE.
AND HE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET INTERESTED
IN ANY OTHER WOMEN SINCE.
Narrator:
HARRY SAW BESS WHENEVER HE COULD,
NEARLY EVERY SUNDAY.
THEY ENJOYED CONCERTS, PLAYS AND CONTINUED TO EXCHANGE LETTERS.
"DEAR BESSIE, YOU MAY BE VERY, VERY SURE
"THAT YOUR LETTERS CANNOT POSSIBLY COME
TOO OFTEN OR TOO REGULAR FOR ME."
"DEAR BESSIE, MY VOICE IS SOMEWHAT WEARY
"FROM YELLING AT THE HORSES.
"PLEASE WRITE ME WHEN YOU HAVE THE TIME
AS I ENJOY YOUR LETTERS VERY MUCH."
FINALLY HARRY DREW UP HIS COURAGE AND PROPOSED...
IN A LETTER.
"DEAR BESSIE, YOU MAY NOT HAVE GUESSED IT
"BUT I'VE BEEN CRAZY ABOUT YOU
"EVER SINCE WE WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL TOGETHER.
"BUT I NEVER HAD THE NERVE TO THINK YOU'D EVEN LOOK AT ME.
"I DON'T THINK SO NOW,
"BUT I CAN'T HELP FROM TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOU.
"WERE I AN ITALIAN OR A POET
"I WOULD USE ALL THE LUSCIOUS LANGUAGE OF TWO CONTINENTS.
"I AM NOT EITHER,
"BUT ONLY A KIND OF GOOD- FOR-NOTHING AMERICAN FARMER.
"IF YOU TURN ME DOWN, I'LL NOT BE THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED
"FOR IT'S NO MORE THAN I EXPECT.
"PLEASE WRITE AS SOON AS YOU FEEL THAT WAY.
"THE SOONER, THE BETTER PLEASED I AM.
"MORE THAN SINCERELY, HARRY."
IT TOOK BESS THREE WEEKS TO RESPOND.
SHE REFUSED, AND HARRY WROTE TO THANK HER
FOR NOT RIDICULING HIM.
"YOU KNOW, YOU TURNED ME DOWN SO EASY
"I AM ALMOST HAPPY ANYWAY.
"I WAS NEVER FOOL ENOUGH TO THINK THAT A GIRL LIKE YOU
COULD EVER CARE FOR A FELLOW LIKE ME."
BUT HARRY WOULDN'T GIVE UP.
HE BOUGHT A SECONDHAND STAFFORD TOURING CAR
TO TAKE BESS COURTING.
WHEN HE LEARNED THAT SHE LIKED TENNIS
HARRY BUILT HER A GRASS TENNIS COURT OUT BEHIND THE FARMHOUSE,
AND THREW A TENNIS PARTY IN HER HONOR.
SHE DIDN'T COME.
"I REALLY WORKED ALL SUNDAY
GETTING THAT COURT READY FOR YOU," HE WROTE HER.
"WE ALSO HAD A SUPPLY OF WATERMELONS ON HAND.
"BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT SOME SATURDAY
AND MAMA SAYS YOU MUST COME TO DINNER NEXT TIME."
McCullough:
PERSISTENCE IS A VERY STRONG THEME
IN HARRY TRUMAN.
HE DOESN'T GIVE UP VERY EASILY.
HE REALLY SET HIS MIND THAT BESS WAS THE ONE,
AND SHE ALWAYS WOULD BE-- NEVER ANY VARIATION IN THAT.
HE JUST KEPT AT IT.
Narrator:
TWO YEARS AFTER SHE TURNED HIM DOWN
BESS BEGAN TO CHANGE HER MIND.
SHE TOLD HARRY THAT IF SHE EVER MARRIED ANYONE, IT WOULD BE HIM.
"DEAR BESS, IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL THAT YOU SHOULD CARE FOR ME.
"I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
"IS HARDLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANY WOMAN
"BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE BEST GIRL IN ALL THE UNIVERSE
"CARING FOR AN ORDINARY GINK LIKE ME
"WELL, YOU JUST HAVE TO LET ME GET USED TO IT.
I'M ALL PUFFED UP AND HILARIOUS AND HAPPY."
BUT BESS WOULD NEVER MARRY A FARMER.
THE FARM WAS $12,000 IN DEBT
AND HARRY WAS STILL WORKING FOR HIS FATHER.
THEN, IN 1914, JOHN TRUMAN,
STRAINING TO REMOVE A BOULDER FROM A ROAD,
SEVERELY INJURED HIMSELF.
X-RAYS REVEALED A TUMOR BLOCKING HIS INTESTINE.
DOCTORS RECOMMENDED SURGERY, BUT HELD OUT LITTLE HOPE.
THE OPERATION FAILED.
HARRY SAW HIS FATHER GROW WEAKER AND WEAKER.
NEAR DEATH, THE WIRY, ONCE-AMBITIOUS MAN
LOOKED BACK ON HIS LIFE.
"I HAVE BEEN," HE TOLD HIS SON, "A FAILURE."
ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 2, 1914,
HARRY RESTED AT HIS FATHER'S BEDSIDE.
"I HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIM, AND WATCHING A LONG TIME,"
TRUMAN SAID LATER.
"WHEN I WOKE UP, HE WAS DEAD."
YEARS LATER, WHEN A WRITER ASKED TRUMAN
IF HIS FATHER HAD BEEN A FAILURE,
HARRY TOLD HIM, "HOW COULD HE BE A FAILURE
IF HIS SON BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?"
Hamby:
THE DEATH OF JOHN TRUMAN WAS A LIBERATION FOR HARRY.
ONCE HE GETS PAST THE POINT OF GRIEF AND SHOCK
AT HIS FATHER'S DEATH
HE IS FINALLY FREE TO SET OUT IN DIRECTIONS OF HIS OWN.
AND HE DECIDES PRETTY QUICKLY
THAT THOSE DIRECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE AWAY FROM THE FARM.
Narrator:
AFTER HEARING TALES OF EASY MONEY
TO BE MADE IN OKLAHOMA, HARRY HEADED SOUTH.
McCullough:
HE IS GOING TO DO AS HIS FATHER HAD DONE
ONLY MAKE WHAT HIS FATHER HAD TRIED WORK.
HIS FATHER GAMBLED.
HIS FATHER GAMBLED AND LOST.
HE WAS GOING TO GAMBLE AND WIN.
Narrator:
HARRY BORROWED SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS
AGAINST HIS LIVESTOCK AND GAMBLED IT ON A ZINC MINE.
HE DECIDED HE'D GET RICH QUICK TO CATCH UP WITH BESS
BECAUSE BESS WAS WELL-TO-DO.
Narrator:
"DEAR BESS, OUR FOREMAN SAYS
"WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER MINE THAN HE EXPECTED.
"WHEN I SEE YOU, I HOPE TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARE GOING FULL BLAST
AND MAKING ORE SO FAST IT MAKES OUR HEAD SWIM."
Hamby:
HE SEEMS TO ASSUME THAT THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO WRONG.
YOU WORK HARD, LADY LUCK WILL BE ON YOUR SIDE AND YOU'LL MAKE IT.
BUT WHAT HARRY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND,
AND WHAT HE'S NEVER GOOD AT,
IS THAT YOU BUY LOW AND YOU SELL HIGH.
"DEAR BESS, THE MINE HAS GONE BY THE BOARD.
"I HAVE LOST OUT ON IT ENTIRELY.
"THERE WAS NEVER ONE OF OUR NAME
"WHO HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO MAKE MONEY.
"I AM NO EXCEPTION.
"YOU WOULD DO BETTER, PERHAPS
"IF YOU PITCHED ME INTO THE ASH HEAP
"AND PICK SOMEONE WITH MORE SENSE AND ABILITY
AND NOT SUCH A SOFT HEAD."
BUT HE SANK ANOTHER $5,000 IN AN OIL WELL COMPANY,
AND CONVINCED BESS TO RISK SOME MONEY, TOO.
"DEAR BESS, PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK OUR PROJECT HAS SOME MERIT.
"WE GOT $225 YESTERDAY.
HOPE TO SEE YOU SUNDAY AND BE SO FULL OF OIL THAT I'LL FLOAT."
Hamby:
HE IS ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC.
HE COMES OUT OF THIS CULTURE THAT SAYS
PEOPLE CAN GET AHEAD IF THEY WORK HARD
AND THEN IT ALSO SAYS IF THEY HAVE A LITTLE LUCK, TOO.
Narrator:
HARRY'S COMPANY RAN OUT OF MONEY AND WENT BUST.
BESS LOST EVERYTHING SHE HAD INVESTED.
HARRY SOLD HIS STAKE TO A BETTER-FINANCED OUTFIT.
THE NEW COMPANY KEPT DRILLING...
AND STRUCK IT RICH.
IF HARRY HAD HUNG ON, DRILLED JUST A LITTLE DEEPER,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MILLIONAIRE.
"DEAR BESS, I SEEM TO HAVE A GRAND AND ADMIRABLE ABILITY
"FOR CALLING TAILS WHEN HEADS COME UP.
"MY LUCK SHOULD SURELY CHANGE.
"SOMETIME I SHOULD WIN.
"I HAVE TRIED TO STICK.
"WORKED, REALLY DID, LIKE THUNDER FOR TEN YEARS
"TO GET THAT OLD FARM IN LINE
"AND I HAVE HAD A CROP FAILURE EVERY YEAR.
THOUGHT I'D CHANGE MY LUCK, AND SEE WHERE IT'S GOTTEN ME."
HARRY TRUMAN WAS 33 YEARS OLD,
AND HAD FAILED AT EVERYTHING HE HAD TRIED.
BUT HARRY DIDN'T FEEL SORRY FOR HIMSELF FOR LONG.
HE CLOSED HIS LETTER BY ASKING BESS:
"CAN I COME OVER TUESDAY NIGHT?
"JUST REMEMBER HOW CRAZY I AM ABOUT YOU
AND FORGET ALL THE REST."
Narrator:
WHEN AMERICA WENT TO WAR IN 1917,
YOUNG MEN FROM SMALL TOWNS ALL ACROSS THE NATION
RESPONDED WITH PATRIOTIC FERVOR.
HARRY TRUMAN WAS ONE OF THEM.
THAT SPRING
HARRY LEFT THE FARM IN THE HANDS OF HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
AND JOINED THE ARMY.
AND AT LONG LAST, BESS AGREED TO MARRY HIM
BUT NOW, HARRY REFUSED.
"I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR ME," HE TOLD HER,
"TO ASK YOU TO TIE YOURSELF TO A PROSPECTIVE CRIPPLE."
THE GREAT WAR HAD ALREADY TAKEN THE LIVES
OF AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF EUROPE'S YOUNG MEN.
ONE MILLION MEN DIED AT THE SOMME...
NEARLY ANOTHER MILLION MORE AT VERDUN.
BUT FOR HARRY, LIKE OTHER RAW RECRUITS,
WAR STILL SHIMMERED WITH ROMANCE.
HE LATER SAID THAT HE WAS STIRRED BY THE FLAME.
"I FELT THAT I WAS GALAHAD AFTER THE GRAIL."
McCullough:
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR TRUMAN
TO HAVE EVER GONE TO WAR.
HE WAS TECHNICALLY BLIND IN ONE EYE.
HIS EYESIGHT WAS SO BAD
THAT HE COULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN IN AT ALL
BUT FOR THE FACT THAT HE MEMORIZED THE EYE CHART
IN ADVANCE OF THE EXAMINATION.
BUT HE WANTED TO GO.
HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO.
Narrator:
HARRY HAD NEVER BEEN TO COLLEGE,
NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT IN HIS LIFE,
BUT HE EARNED THE RANK OF CAPTAIN, WAS SENT TO FRANCE,
AND GIVEN COMMAND OF FOUR RAPID-FIRE GUNS...
AND 194 MEN.
ON THE MORNING OF JULY 11, 1918,
CAPTAIN HARRY TRUMAN INTRODUCED HIMSELF
TO THE NOTORIOUS BATTERY "D,"
A ROWDY BUNCH, MOSTLY IRISH, FROM KANSAS CITY
SOME OF THE MOST INSUBORDINATE SOLDIERS
IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY.
"NEVER," HARRY SAID LATER, "HAVE I FELT SO NERVOUS."
Man:
WE'D BEEN A PRETTY TOUGH BUNCH.
WE'D GOTTEN RID OF THREE CAPTAINS.
BUT THE FIRST NIGHT, HE ADDRESSED THE BATTERY.
HE SAYS, "I DIDN'T COME OVER HERE
"TO GET ALONG WITH YOU FELLOWS.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ALONG WITH ME."
I SAID TO AN IRISHMAN, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEW CAPTAIN?"
HE SAYS, "90 DAYS, 90 DAYS."
Narrator:
"YOU COULD SEE," ONE OF THE MEN REMEMBERED,
"THAT HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH."
McCullough:
WORLD WAR I WAS THE CRUCIBLE FOR TRUMAN.
IT WAS THE FORMATIVE EXPERIENCE OF HIS LIFE.
IT CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR HIM:
CHANGED HIM, CHANGED HIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIMSELF.
Narrator:
AT THE END OF AUGUST, CAPTAIN TRUMAN LED
HIS MEN INTO BATTLE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
BATTERY "D" OPENED FIRE ON A COMPANY OF GERMAN SOLDIERS
ENCAMPED FOUR MILES AWAY.
BEFORE THE GERMANS COULD RETURN THE FIRE
TRUMAN ORDERED HIS MEN TO TAKE A NEW POSITION.
BUT THEY COULDN'T MOVE WITHOUT THE HORSES TO PULL THE CANNONS.
Wooden:
HARRY HAD GIVEN THE FIRST SERGEANT ORDERS
TO HAVE THE HORSES UP AT A CERTAIN HOUR,
BUT THE FIRST SERGEANT WAS 30 MINUTES LATE GETTING UP THERE.
WE'D HAVE BEEN AWAY FROM THERE IF HE HAD'VE.
THAT'S WHERE THE TROUBLE STARTED.
Narrator:
IT WAS DARK AND RAINING
WHEN THE GERMANS OPENED FIRE.
BATTERY "D" WAS TRAPPED, ITS BIG GUNS MIRED IN THE MUD.
THE MEN PANICKED.
MANY RAN.
McCullough:
AND TRUMAN IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
AND HE SEES EVERYBODY TAKING OFF
AND HE STANDS THERE AND HE CALLS THEM EVERY NAME HE CAN THINK OF,
AND HE KNEW A LOT OF NAMES.
Narrator:
"YOU NO-GOOD IRISH SONS OF BITCHES," HE HOLLERED,
AND ORDERED HIS SOLDIERS TO REGROUP.
THE MEN, STUNNED BY HIS RAGE, INSPIRED BY HIS COURAGE,
DID AS THEY WERE TOLD.
THROUGH THE DARK AND RAIN
TRUMAN MARCHED THEM OUT OF DANGER.
"DEAR BESS, THE MEN THINK I AM NOT MUCH AFRAID OF SHELLS
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW I WAS TOO SCARED TO RUN."
BATTERY "D" HAD ESCAPED WITHOUT A SINGLE CASUALTY.
McCullough:
AND THEY THEREAFTER SAW HIM DIFFERENTLY
BECAUSE HE HAD STOOD HIS GROUND.
AND AFTER A WHILE, THEY BEGAN TO REALIZE
THAT THIS FELLOW WITH THE EYEGLASSES
AND THE BANK-CLERK LOOK ABOUT HIM
WAS IN FACT A MAN OF REAL DETERMINATION.
Narrator:
CAPTAIN HARRY, THE MEN DECIDED, WAS GOOD LUCK.
"WE HAVE A CAPTAIN," ONE SOLDIER WROTE HIS FATHER,
"WHO CANNOT BE BEAT."
McCullough:
HE WAS ABOUT AS UNHEROIC IN HIS EYEGLASSES
AS ONE COULD BE.
BUT THERE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM THAT IS ON HIS I.D. CARD
AND HE HAS HIS GLASSES OFF.
AND YOU LOOK AT THAT PHOTOGRAPH AND YOU SEE THE STRENGTH
YOU SEE WHAT A RUGGED CHARACTER HE IS.
HARRY VAUGHAN ONCE SAID
THAT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND HARRY TRUMAN
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT HE'S ONE TOUGH SON OF A BITCH OF A MAN.
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE IRON.
YOU CAN SEE WHAT HIS MEN MUST HAVE RECOGNIZED AND UNDERSTOOD.
Narrator:
AT NIGHT, HARRY WOULD SIT AND STARE AT A PHOTOGRAPH
HE'D BROUGHT WITH HIM TO EUROPE.
"DEAR BESS, I HAVE TWO BREAST POCKETS IN MY BLOUSE.
"NATURALLY YOU CAN GUESS
"WHOSE PICTURE STAYS IN THE LEFT-HAND ONE.
"IT HAS NEVER LEFT ME, NOR WILL IT EVER.
"I HAVE LOOKED AT IT MANY, MANY TIMES
"AND IMAGINED THAT YOU WERE THERE IN SPIRIT
"AS I KNEW YOU WERE, AND IT HELPED A LOT.
"I HOPE YOU HAVE A MOST HAPPY BIRTHDAY
"AND THAT YOU WILL NEVER SEE ANOTHER ONE WITHOUT ME
"TO HELP CELEBRATE.
AND THEN, MAY THEY GO ON WITHOUT END."
BY NOVEMBER, THE WAR TO END ALL WARS WAS OVER.
CAPTAIN TRUMAN AND THE BOYS FROM BATTERY "D"
HAD SEEN SOME OF THE BLOODIEST FIGHTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
"DEAR BESS, YOU KNOW I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING
"WHAT WAS MY GREATEST AMBITION TO DO
"AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR--
"THAT IS TO TAKE A BATTERY THROUGH AND NOT LOSE A MAN.
"WE FIRED SOME 10,000 ROUNDS AT HEINIE
"AND WERE SHELLED OURSELVES TIME AND AGAIN
BUT NEVER DID THE HUNS SCORE A HIT ON ME."
Hamby:
TRUMAN'S WARTIME SERVICE WAS AWFULLY IMPORTANT TO HIM
BECAUSE IT WAS THE GREATEST SUCCESS HE HAD HAD IN HIS LIFE
UP TILL THAT POINT.
HE COMES OUT OF IT HAVING ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
AS A LEADER OF MEN,
AND THAT'S SOMETHING HE NEVER COULD HAVE SAID ABOUT HIMSELF
AT ANY POINT EARLIER IN HIS LIFE.
Narrator:
IN JANUARY 1919, HARRY WATCHED
AS PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON ARRIVED IN PARIS
TO A TUMULTUOUS RECEPTION.
WORLD LEADERS WERE GATHERING TO ENSURE A LASTING PEACE.
EMPIRES HAD FALLEN.
THE MAP OF EUROPE WAS ABOUT TO BE REDRAWN
BUT HARRY TRUMAN SIMPLY WANTED TO GO BACK TO MISSOURI.
"FOR MY PART," HE WROTE,
"I DON'T GIVE A WHOOP WHETHER THERE'S A LEAGUE OF NATIONS
"OR WHETHER RUSSIA HAS A RED GOVERNMENT OR A PURPLE ONE.
"AND IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CZECHOSLOVAKS
"WANTS TO PRY THE THRONE FROM UNDER THE KING OF BOHEMIA,
LET HIM PRY, BUT SEND US HOME."
BUT IT WOULD BE MONTHS
BEFORE THE ARMY WOULD LET HARRY GO BACK TO MISSOURI.
HE TOURED FRANCE, SAW THE RIVIERA AND PARIS,
THE EIFFEL TOWER, NOTRE DAME...
THE FOLIES-BERGERE.
40 YEARS LATER, HARRY WOULD REMEMBER IT AS "DISGUSTING."
AT THE TIME, HE WROTE
THAT IT WAS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE IN KANSAS CITY,
ONLY MORE SO.
(wedding march playing)
Narrator:
SEVEN WEEKS AFTER RETURNING HOME,
ON JUNE 28, 1919,
A DAY SO HOT THE FLOWERS IN THE CHAPEL WILTED,
HARRY TRUMAN MARRIED BESS WALLACE
AT TINY TRINITY EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN INDEPENDENCE.
HARRY WAS 35.
29 YEARS HAD PASSED
SINCE HE HAD FIRST SEEN BESS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL,
EIGHT YEARS SINCE HE FIRST PROPOSED.
HE HAD NEVER DATED ANOTHER WOMAN.
ONE OF TRUMAN'S MEN FROM BATTERY "D" WROTE HIM,
"I HOPE YOU HAVE THE SAME SUCCESS IN THIS NEW WAR
AS YOU HAD IN THE OLD."
AFTER A HONEYMOON ON THE GREAT LAKES,
HARRY MOVED ALL HIS BELONGINGS INTO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S HOUSE.
Hamby:
I THINK IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO BESS
THAT HE WAS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HER OBLIGATIONS TO MRS. WALLACE
AND, ABSOLUTELY, LIVE WITH MRS. WALLACE,
WHO WAS AN AWFULLY HARD PERSON TO LIVE WITH.
HARRY SPENT MUCH OF HIS ADULT LIFE
ALMOST BEING A PUNCHING BAG FOR HER.
HE NEVER TALKED BACK TO HER.
HE FORCED HIMSELF TO THINK ONLY THE NICEST THOUGHTS ABOUT HER,
AT LEAST AS FAR AS ANYTHING THAT'S EVER BEEN RECORDED.
Narrator:
ALTHOUGH HIS NEW BRIDE ASSURED HIM
THE SITUATION WAS TEMPORARY,
HARRY WOULD LIVE WITH BESS'S FAMILY FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS.
(military band music playing)
Narrator:
IN 1919, AS AMERICA CELEBRATED THE END OF WORLD WAR I,
HARRY TRUMAN WAS JUST ANOTHER SOLDIER IN SEARCH OF A JOB.
EDDIE JACOBSON, HARRY'S OLD ARMY BUDDY,
WAS OUT OF WORK, TOO.
EDDIE SUGGESTED THEY GO INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER
IN DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY.
JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
THEY OPENED UP A LITTLE HABERDASHERY ON 12th STREET
SELLING GENTS' FURNISHINGS.
KANSAS CITY HAD GROWN FAMOUS FOR ITS SOUL-STIRRING JAZZ.
HARRY DIDN'T TAKE MUCH TO THE MUSIC--
NEVER EVEN LEARNED TO DANCE--
BUT JAZZ MADE THE DOWNTOWN SWING...
AND THAT WAS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
EVERYBODY SEEMED TO HAVE MONEY TO SPEND.
"WE SOLD SHIRTS AT $16," EDDIE REMEMBERED.
Woman:
HARRY WAS THE SALESMAN AND EDDIE WAS THE BUYER.
THEY REALLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER IN THE BUSINESS.
THERE WERE NO CONFLICTS.
AND THEY WERE GOOD BUDDIES.
THEY PLAYED POKER EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT.
TRUMAN CALLED EDDIE "YOU BALDHEADED S.O.B."
THEY WERE CUT FROM THE SAME MIDWESTERN CLOTH,
EXCEPT THAT THE RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND WAS NOT THE SAME.
Narrator:
EDDIE JACOBSON WAS JEWISH,
BORN ON NEW YORK CITY'S LOWER EAST SIDE.
ALTHOUGH HARRY AND EDDIE WERE FRIENDS,
HARRY COULDN'T BRING EDDIE HOME FOR DINNER.
BESS'S MOTHER OBJECTED.
HARRY AND EDDIE MADE A GOOD TEAM.
THEY WORKED HARD, FROM 8:00 IN THE MORNING TO 9:00 AT NIGHT.
BUT THE LITTLE HABERDASHERY STRUGGLED.
AND IN 1922, AFTER JUST TWO YEARS,
CAUGHT IN A POSTWAR RECESSION, IT WENT UNDER.
HARRY WAS 38 AND DEEP IN DEBT.
"WENT INTO BUSINESS ALL ENTHUSIASTIC," HE WROTE.
"LOST ALL I HAD AND ALL I COULD BORROW.
FEELING FAIRLY BLUE."
HARRY WAS FACING FAILURE ONCE AGAIN,
BUT HIS LUCK WAS FINALLY ABOUT TO CHANGE.
OLD ARMY PAL JIM PENDERGAST THOUGHT TRUMAN'S WAR RECORD
WOULD MAKE HIM A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR POLITICAL OFFICE
AND PUT IN A CALL TO HIS UNCLE TOM.
TOM PENDERGAST WAS A RAWBONED,
THICK-NECKED, SPAT-WEARING IRISHMAN.
CRASS AND COLORFUL, PENDERGAST WAS A HARD DRINKER
AND A RECKLESS GAMBLER.
IN TIME HE WOULD LOSE, SOME SAID, $6 MILLION ON THE PONIES.
BUT HE KNEW HOW TO WIN AT POLITICS.
A TOUGH BACKSTAGE OPERATOR,
HE WOULD BUILD A POLITICAL MACHINE SO STRONG
AND CONTROL IT WITH SUCH AN IRON GRIP
THAT ONE DAY PUNDITS WOULD CALL KANSAS CITY "TOM'S TOWN."
PENDERGAST MADE MONEY
SELLING THE COUNTY CONCRETE AND REAL ESTATE,
MONOPOLIZING THE MARKET
AND LINING HIS POCKETS WITH LUCRATIVE KICKBACKS.
BUT IN KANSAS CITY IN THE '20s,
THERE WERE MANY WAYS TO GET RICH.
GAMBLING, BOOTLEG LIQUOR, PROSTITUTION, NARCOTICS--
PENDERGAST WAS INTO ALL OF IT.
HE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE KANSAS CITY RACKETS
AND MANIPULATED JACKSON COUNTY POLITICS.
IN 1922, WHEN PENDERGAST NEEDED SOMEONE
TO STAND FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONER
OR "JUDGE," AS THE POSITION WAS CALLED,
PENDERGAST CHOSE WAR HERO HARRY TRUMAN.
HARRY SAW HIS CHANCE AND, WITHOUT HESITATION, GRABBED IT.
Man:
PENDERGAST TURNED TO TRUMAN
TO SORT OF PERFUME THE PENDERGAST MACHINE
BY GETTING A PERSON WHO HAD INTEGRITY
WHO ALSO HAD STRONG SUPPORT AMONG VETERANS OF WORLD WAR I.
Narrator:
BUT PENDERGAST DID NOT YET CONTROL
ALL OF JACKSON COUNTY.
HARRY WOULD HAVE TO CAMPAIGN HARD, AND HE WAS GREEN.
HE COUNTED ON PENDERGAST, HIS WAR RECORD
AND THE BOYS FROM BATTERY "D."
McCullough:
HE WAS PATHETIC AS A SPEAKER.
HE COULD HARDLY EXPRESS HIMSELF AT ALL,
AND HIS PALS FROM THE ARMY ALL WENT OUT
AND CAMPAIGNED HARD FOR HIM AND THEY WOULD CHEER AT EVERY RALLY
AND THEY WOULD TRY AND WHIP UP EXCITEMENT
FOR THEIR BELOVED CAPTAIN HARRY.
AND AT ONE POINT, THEY DECIDED IT WOULD BE DRAMATIC
IF TRUMAN ARRIVED BY PLANE, SO THEY GOT A WORLD WAR I BIPLANE
AND ONE OF THE ARMY PALS FLEW THE PLANE.
TRUMAN CAME SAILING THROUGH THE AIR,
LANDED, CLIMBED OUT OF THE PLANE,
STAGGERED ACROSS THE FIELD, VIOLENTLY ILL, TO A FENCE,
WHERE HE THREW UP IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.
AND THAT WAS SORT OF HIS FIRST GREAT ENTRANCE AS A POLITICIAN.
Narrator:
HIS SPEECHES WERE BLUNT,
HIS VOICE FLAT, HIS STYLE COARSE, EVEN CRUDE.
BUT HE LIKED POLITICKING WITH THE PEOPLE OF JACKSON COUNTY--
THE TALK, THE JOKES, THE CAMARADERIE.
HE WAS TIRELESS AND ENERGETIC
AND HE WON-- BY JUST 279 VOTES.
HE WOULD BE ELECTED TWO MORE TIMES IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS.
AFTER YEARS OF DRIFT AND FAILURE,
HARRY TRUMAN HAD FINALLY SETTLED INTO A CAREER.
COUNTY COMMISSIONER WAS A BIG JOB.
HARRY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 700 EMPLOYEES AND $7 MILLION A YEAR.
Man:
HE WAS FAMOUS AT THAT TIME FOR BEING A BUILDER,
AND HE BUILT SOME GREAT HIGHWAYS IN JACKSON COUNTY.
THAT WAS AT A TIME WHEN THEY USED TO SAY,
"MISSOURI?
!
STAY OUT OF MISSOURI AND STAY OUT OF THE MUD."
Narrator:
TRUMAN LOVED THE JOB:
THE POWER...
THE PRESTIGE...
THE CHANCE TO DO GOOD THINGS.
HE WORKED WITH IRISH AND ITALIAN CATHOLICS
AND BLACK COMMUNITY LEADERS,
SLOWLY MOVING AWAY FROM SMALL-TOWN PREJUDICES.
HE EARNED A REPUTATION FOR EFFICIENCY, HONESTY,
WON THE RESPECT OF THE NEWSPAPERS,
BUT HE COULD NOT WIN THE PRAISE OF BESS'S MOTHER,
WHO DISAPPROVED OF POLITICS.
BUT HARRY NEVER COMPLAINED.
HIS LIFE HAD AT LAST FOUND DIRECTION.
IN 1924, MARGARET, HIS FIRST AND ONLY CHILD, WAS BORN.
HARRY WAS NEARLY 40,
WITH A DAUGHTER HE ADORED, A WIFE HE DEARLY LOVED
AND DOZENS OF FRIENDS.
HE JOINED THE ELKS, THE MASONS, THE AMERICAN LEGION,
THE AMERICAN VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS,
THE INTERNATIONAL ACQUAINTANCE LEAGUE
AND SPENT EVERY MONDAY NIGHT
IN A BACK ROOM OVER A BANK PLAYING POKER.
BUT HE WAS TROUBLED.
BROUGHT UP TO HONOR
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG,
HARRY FOUND IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT
TO DEAL WITH THE MAN TO WHOM HE OWED HIS JOB.
BY 1930, TOM PENDERGAST DOMINATED KANSAS CITY POLITICS,
WHILE HIS INVOLVEMENT IN KANSAS CITY RACKETEERING HAD BECOME
EVEN MORE UNSAVORY.
THE RUTHLESS GANGSTER JOHNNY LAZIA WAS HIS LIEUTENANT.
KANSAS CITY BECAME NOTORIOUS FOR SHOOT-OUTS, ARSON, KIDNAPPINGS.
HARRY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MOBSTERS, BUT HE TURNED HIS BACK
WHILE PENDERGAST SKIMMED MILLIONS IN PUBLIC MONEY.
TORN BETWEEN LOYALTY TO PENDERGAST
AND HIS OWN SELF-RESPECT,
HE BEGAN SUFFERING FROM ACUTE HEADACHES, DIZZINESS, INSOMNIA.
PENDERGAST DEMANDED THAT HARRY RIG COUNTY CONTRACTS.
HARRY INSISTED ON FAIR BIDDING.
HIS HONOR, HE SAID, WAS AT STAKE.
PENDERGAST TOLD HARRY HIS HONOR WASN'T WORTH A PINCH OF SNUFF.
HARRY'S ANXIETY GREW SO GREAT
THAT HE QUIETLY TOOK A ROOM AT A HOTEL IN DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY
AND POURED OUT HIS TROUBLES ON PAGES HE KEPT
BUT WOULD NEVER SHOW ANYONE.
"AM I JUST A CROOK," HE WROTE,
"TO COMPROMISE IN ORDER TO GET THE JOB DONE?
"I WONDER IF I DID RIGHT.
"I SAVED $3,500,000
"BUT I HAD TO PUT A LOT OF NO-GOOD SONS OF BITCHES
"ON THE PAYROLL, AND PAY OTHER SONS OF BITCHES
"MORE MONEY FOR SUPPLIES THAN THEY WERE WORTH
"IN ORDER TO SATISFY THE POLITICAL POWERS.
I BELIEVE I DID DO RIGHT."
HARRY REFUSED TO CONDEMN PENDERGAST HIMSELF.
"HE OWNED A BAWDY HOUSE, A SALOON
AND GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENT," HARRY WROTE,
"BUT HE'S ALL MAN."
HARRY DID AGREE TO GIVE COUNTY JOBS TO MACHINE LOYALISTS,
RELATIVES AND FRIENDS.
BUT HE RESOLVED NEVER TO TAKE A BRIBE OR KICKBACK HIMSELF.
McCullough:
TRUMAN ACCEPTED HIS ASSOCIATION WITH THE PENDERGASTS
AS THE PRICE HE HAD TO PAY TO BE IN POLITICS,
NOT UNLIKE, ONE MIGHT SAY,
ACCEPTING LIVING WITH MADGE WALLACE
AND IN HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S HOUSE
AS THE PRICE HE HAD TO PAY TO MARRY BESS.
Narrator:
IN 1932, WHEN HARRY WENT WITH PENDERGAST
TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN CHICAGO,
HE SAW FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
Franklin Roosevelt:
GIVE ME YOUR HELP
IN THIS CRUSADE TO RESTORE AMERICA TO ITS OWN PEOPLE.
Narrator:
IN ACCEPTING HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION,
THE 51-YEAR-OLD ROOSEVELT ACHIEVED A LIFELONG AMBITION.
HARRY S. TRUMAN WAS 48, UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OF MISSOURI.
NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
HE BEGAN TO REVEAL HIS OWN AMBITIONS.
HE LET IT BE KNOWN
THAT HE WANTED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR OR CONGRESS,
BUT PENDERGAST HAD OTHER CANDIDATES IN MIND.
THEN IN 1934, WHEN PENDERGAST WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW SENATOR,
SOME OF THE BOSS'S AIDES RECOMMENDED HARRY.
"DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME," PENDERGAST BELLOWED,
"YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT HARRY TRUMAN CAN BE ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE?
!"
AFTER THREE OTHER MEN TURNED HIM DOWN,
PENDERGAST SETTLED FOR HARRY TRUMAN
AND BACKED HIM IN THE MISSOURI PRIMARY.
TRUMAN'S OPPONENTS CALLED HIM "PENDERGAST'S BELLHOP."
THE ELECTION TURNED ON KANSAS CITY,
WHERE PENDERGAST MADE CERTAIN
THAT TRUMAN GOT ALL BUT 11,000 OF ITS 148,000 VOTES.
PENDERGAST ACTUALLY STUFFED THE BALLOT BOXES WITH ILLEGAL VOTES
AND PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T REGISTERED.
Narrator:
THE NEW UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM MISSOURI
WAS 50 YEARS OLD
AND HAD NEVER BEEN TO WASHINGTON FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.
McCullough:
SO OFF HE GOES TO WASHINGTON,
AND TOM PENDERGAST'S PARTING WORDS
TO THE NEW SENATOR FROM MISSOURI ARE,
"KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND ANSWER YOUR MAIL."
AND HE ARRIVES IN WASHINGTON WITH A SHADOW OVER HIM--
A CLOUD OVER HIM-
- AS THE "SENATOR FROM PENDERGAST,"
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN SENATORS WHO WON'T EVEN SPEAK TO HIM
BECAUSE HE HAS SUCH A STIGMA ATTACHED TO HIM.
Narrator:
HARRY, BESS AND MARGARET SETTLED
INTO THE NATION'S CAPITAL,
MOVING INTO AN INEXPENSIVE FOUR-ROOM APARTMENT.
BUT BESS WASN'T HAPPY THERE.
SHE LASTED JUST FIVE MONTHS
BEFORE SHE RETURNED TO INDEPENDENCE.
HER MOTHER WANTED HER HOME.
SHE AND MARGARET SHUTTLED BACK AND FORTH TO WASHINGTON,
WHERE THE TRUMANS RENTED ONE SMALL APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER.
THROUGHOUT HARRY'S YEARS IN THE SENATE,
BESS SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME IN INDEPENDENCE,
LEAVING SENATOR TRUMAN HEARTSICK AND LONELY.
"DEAR BESS, I'VE BEEN WANDERING AROUND
"LIKE A LOST SOUL THIS MORNING.
"IT'S A WRENCH TO BE WITHOUT YOU.
I NEVER MISSED YOU SO MUCH."
"DEAR BESS, YOUR CARD WAS A LIFESAVER THIS MORNING.
I NEVER IN MY LIFE SPENT SUCH A LONESOME NIGHT."
"DEAR BESS, YOUR LETTER CAME ON THE SECOND MAIL,
SO EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT."
"DEAR BESS, YOUR LETTER WAS IN THE FIRST MAIL."
"DEAR BESS, I DO WISH YOU'D LET ME HEAR..."
"DEAR BESS, DREAMED ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT.
"THOUGHT WE WERE GOING THROUGH A FLOOD TOGETHER.
WE GOT THROUGH WITHOUT DISASTER."
"DEAR BESS, IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE LAST NIGHT..."
"DEAR BESS, I WAS SO LONESOME LAST NIGHT.
EVEN IF MY COMBINATION OF WORDS MAKES YOU SICK SOMETIMES..."
"DEAR BESS, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
"IF YOUR DRESS DOESN'T FIT YOU,
SEND IT BACK AND WE'LL GET A LARGER ONE."
"DEAR BESS, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATED
"THE LETTER THAT CAME IN THE MORNING'S MAIL.
"I WAS SO DEVILISHLY HOMESICK.
"I COULD SEE YOU STANDING OUT THERE IN THE YARD
"WATCHING ME DRIVE AWAY,
AND I DON'T THINK YOU KISSED ME GOOD-BYE."
IT WOULD BE YEARS
BEFORE SENATOR TRUMAN GAINED ENOUGH CONFIDENCE
TO WORK HIMSELF OUT FROM UNDER PENDERGAST'S SHADOW.
HE CAME IN, A FRIEND REMEMBERED, WITH A REAL INFERIORITY COMPLEX.
"I WAS AS TIMID," TRUMAN LATER WROTE,
"AS A COUNTRY BOY ARRIVING
ON THE CAMPUS OF A GREAT UNIVERSITY."
WITH AMERICA CAUGHT IN THE GRIPS OF THE DEPRESSION,
TRUMAN FELL IN LINE
WITH FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL PROGRAMS.
HE CALLED ROOSEVELT "THE GREATEST OF THE GREATS."
BUT ROOSEVELT HIMSELF HAD NO USE
FOR THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM MISSOURI.
IT TOOK FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE SUMMONED TRUMAN
FOR A 15-MINUTE MEETING.
AFTER JUST SEVEN MINUTES, TRUMAN WAS SHOWN THE DOOR.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.
ROOSEVELT REALLY GAVE HIM THE BACK OF HIS HAND.
PEOPLE ON THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF
GAVE HIM THE BACK OF THEIR HANDS.
HE COULDN'T GET APPOINTMENTS.
HE WASN'T SOMEBODY THAT THEY TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY.
Narrator:
TRUMAN SAT FOR MONTHS IN THE SENATE CHAMBER
WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE SPEECH.
HE WAS KNOWN AS "GO ALONG, GET ALONG HARRY."
McCullough:
HE HAS TO PROVE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE SENATE
THAT HE'S SOMEBODY TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY,
THAT HE'S A HARD WORKER AND THAT HE'S HONEST
AND THAT HE'S GOING TO DO THE JOB.
AND HE GAVE IT EVERYTHING HE HAD.
HE WOULD WORK LONGER DAYS, HARDER DAYS THAN ANYBODY.
HE WAS IN THERE BEFORE ANYBODY SHOWED UP.
HE WAS ASSIGNED TO COMMITTEES
AND HE WOULD SHOW UP WHEN NOBODY ELSE WOULD SHOW UP
FOR DREARY COMMITTEE SESSIONS AND DREARY COMMITTEE HEARINGS,
VERY OFTEN THE ONLY ONE THERE LISTENING TO HOURS AND HOURS
OF DEADLY TESTIMONY ABOUT DEADLY SUBJECTS,
BUT HE WAS GOING TO DO THE JOB.
HE WAS GOING TO LEARN THE BUSINESS.
AND, AS TIME WENT BY,
IN A MATTER OF ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS,
THEY BEGAN TO REALIZE
WHAT KIND OF A FELLOW THEY HAD ON THEIR HANDS.
Narrator:
SLOWLY, TRUMAN BEGAN TO PROVE HIMSELF.
BUT EVEN AS HE BECAME MORE AND MORE INDEPENDENT,
HE REMAINED LOYAL TO TOM PENDERGAST.
HE KEPT A FRAMED PORTRAIT OF THE MISSOURI BOSS IN HIS OFFICE,
EVEN THOUGH PENDERGAST WAS IN TROUBLE.
PENDERGAST WAS SERIOUSLY ILL,
HIS GAMBLING OUT OF CONTROL, HIS DEBTS IN THE MILLIONS.
IN 1939, A GRAND JURY INDICTED HIM FOR TAX EVASION.
CONVICTED, HE WAS SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR 15 MONTHS
AND BANNED FROM POLITICS FOR FIVE YEARS.
THE SCANDAL TAINTED TRUMAN
AND IT COULDN'T HAVE COME AT A WORSE TIME;
IN 1940, HE WAS UP FOR REELECTION.
HIS OPPONENTS DERIDED HIM
AS A FRAUDULENT SENATOR ELECTED BY GHOST VOTES...
A PENDERGAST LACKEY.
TRUMAN TRIED TO CONVINCE VOTERS
THAT PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT SUPPORTED HIM,
BUT ROOSEVELT NEVER DID.
McCullough:
ROOSEVELT WANTED TO DISTANCE HIMSELF
FROM HARRY TRUMAN.
ROOSEVELT CONSIDERED TRUMAN
AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
Narrator:
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT OR PENDERGAST,
TRUMAN HAD TO GO IT ALONE.
MOST OBSERVERS DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
BUT HE NEVER GAVE UP...
AND EKED OUT A NARROW VICTORY.
HE WON BY JUST 8,000 VOTES.
TRUMAN RETURNED TO THE SENATE HIS OWN MAN,
BUT HE WOULD REMAIN A BACKBENCHER
UNTIL ONCE AGAIN, A WAR WOULD REVEAL HIS STRENGTH AS A LEADER
AND CATAPULT HIM INTO THE LIMELIGHT.
(explosion)
Narrator:
1940-
- NAZI ARMIES SWEPT ACROSS EUROPE.
GREAT BRITAIN WAS UNDER ATTACK.
THE UNITED STATES WASN'T IN IT YET...
BUT AMERICA WAS GETTING READY,
BUILDING PLANES...
MUNITIONS...
TANKS...
ARMY CAMPS.
BACK IN WASHINGTON, TRUMAN WAS RECEIVING COMPLAINTS
ABOUT WASTE, MISMANAGEMENT AND EVEN FRAUD,
AND ALL BY HIMSELF, HE DECIDED TO LOOK INTO IT.
Man:
WITHOUT LETTING ANYBODY IN HIS PARTY KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOING,
HE DECIDED TO GO SEE FOR HIMSELF.
AND HE TOOK A LONG AUTOMOBILE DRIVE--
AS I RECALL, HE DROVE A DIRTY OLD DODGE IN THOSE DAYS--
AND HE CLIMBED IN HIS DODGE, DROVE SOUTH.
HE MUST HAVE HAD A LIST OF THE CAMPS THAT WERE BEING BUILT
AND WHEREVER HE WENT, HE STOPPED AT ONE OF THESE.
HE WENT IN AND STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS.
NOBODY EVER ASKED HIM WHO HE WAS
OR WHY HE WAS ASKING THESE QUESTIONS.
HE'D TALK TO WORKERS.
HE'D TALK TO FOREMEN.
Narrator:
TRUMAN WAS APPALLED BY WHAT HE SAW.
"THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF MEN," HE SAID,
"JUST STANDING AROUND COLLECTING THEIR PAY, DOING NOTHING."
Sparks:
HE SAW BIG PILES OF LUMBER JUST LYING THERE,
NOBODY WAS USING IT;
TRUCKS STANDING STILL AND RUSTING.
Narrator:
CONGRESS HAD AUTHORIZED MORE THAN $10 BILLION
FOR DEFENSE CONTRACTS IN JUST SIX MONTHS.
FROM HIS OWN HIGHLY PERSONAL INVESTIGATION,
TRUMAN FEARED THE MONEY WAS BEING SQUANDERED.
ON FEBRUARY 10, 1941,
SENATOR TRUMAN PROPOSED THE FORMATION OF A COMMITTEE
TO INVESTIGATE THE ENTIRE NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM.
Sparks:
THE WHITE HOUSE DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA AT ALL.
THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY POKING INTO WHAT THEY WERE DOING,
BUT THEY THOUGHT AT THE OUTSET
THAT THEY COULD PROBABLY CONTROL HARRY TRUMAN
AND HE WOULD DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SENATE WANTED HIM TO DO.
THEY FOUND OUT DIFFERENT.
Narrator:
ON DECEMBER 8, AMERICA WENT TO WAR.
TRUMAN WAS ALL AT ONCE THRUST CENTER STAGE.
LABELED AS THE LACKEY
OF ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT BOSSES IN AMERICA,
HE WOULD NOW MOVE TO STAMP OUT CORRUPTION
IN THE LARGEST WAR MACHINE EVER ASSEMBLED.
TRUMAN TOOK ON THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN AMERICA
AND THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST INDUSTRIES--
STEEL, ALUMINUM, RUBBER, AIRPLANES.
McCullough:
HE HAD A DISTRUST OF BIG BUSINESS,
A DISTRUST OF WALL STREET,
AND HE WENT AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY SELLING SHODDY GOODS
OR DOING THINGS THAT WERE CLEARLY UNPATRIOTIC.
Sparks:
IN A HEARING, HE SHOWED ABSOLUTELY NO FEAR.
HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE MEANT BUSINESS.
HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY.
HE WAS FEARED.
Truman:
THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING
THE NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM
HAS FOUND WASTE, INEFFICIENCY, MISMANAGEMENT AND PROFITEERING.
Narrator:
HE QUESTIONED WITNESSES RELENTLESSLY,
ATTACKING THEM FOR BAD PLANNING, SLOPPY ADMINISTRATION, GRAFT.
HIS REPUTATION SOARED.
THE COMMITTEE BECAME KNOWN AS THE TRUMAN COMMITTEE.
HE PERSONALLY SAVED THE NATION BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
REPORTERS NAMED HIM
ONE OF THE TEN MOST VALUABLE MEN IN WASHINGTON.
"THE SUDDEN EMERGENCE OF HARRY TRUMAN IN THE SENATE,"
TIME MAGAZINE WROTE, "IS A QUEER ACCIDENT OF DEMOCRACY."
EVEN PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WANTED SOME OF THE CREDIT.
"YES, YES," ROOSEVELT SAID,
"I PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF THAT WAR-INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE,
DIDN'T I?"
Hechler:
HERE WAS ONE OF THE PRODUCTS
OF ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT POLITICAL MACHINES
IN THE NATION-- THE PENDERGAST MACHINE--
YET HE WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOVE IT,
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT HARRY TRUMAN.
Narrator:
AT LAST, TRUMAN HAD FOUND A HOME IN THE SENATE.
POPULAR, NATIONALLY KNOWN, HE BECAME AN INSIDER--
A RESPECTED MEMBER OF ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL CLUBS IN AMERICA.
HIS PRIVATE LIFE, TOO, HAD SETTLED
INTO A COMFORTABLE ROUTINE.
MARGARET TRUMAN-- "MISS SKINNY," HARRY LIKED TO CALL HER--
HAD BEGUN SINGING LESSONS
AND WAS ALREADY TALKING OF A SINGING CAREER.
"HE LOOKED ALWAYS, HIS DAUGHTER SAID,
AS IF HE HAD JUST STEPPED FROM A BANDBOX."
HIS SUITS WERE ALWAYS CLEANED AND PRESSED;
HIS STYLE, IMMACULATE.
TO BESS, HE REMAINED COMPLETELY DEVOTED.
"DEAR BESS, WELL, I DOUBT YOU WILL REMEMBER IT,
"BUT TOMORROW IS AN ANNIVERSARY OF VITAL IMPORTANCE.
"23 YEARS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SHORT
"AND FOR ME, ALTOGETHER MOST HAPPY ONES.
"A FAILURE AS A FARMER, A MINER, AN OIL PROMOTER AND A MERCHANT,
"BUT FINALLY HIT THE GROOVE AS A PUBLIC SERVANT
AND THAT DUE MOSTLY TO YOU AND LADY LUCK."
SENATOR TRUMAN WAS CONTENT,
BUT IN THE SUMMER OF 1943, HE BEGAN TO HEAR DISTURBING TALK.
CERTAIN PEOPLE WANTED HIM TO RUN FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.
TRUMAN CALLED THEM "BLOWHARDS."
ON JULY 18, 1944,
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS CONVENED IN CHICAGO,
THE RUMORS THAT HARRY TRUMAN WAS GOING TO BE
THE NEXT VICE-PRESIDENT WERE STILL JUST RUMORS.
HE HAD, IN FACT, ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION
PREPARED TO NOMINATE ANOTHER MAN.
"I DON'T WANT TO BE VICE-PRESIDENT,"
HE WOULD TELL ANYONE WHO ASKED.
HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT LIKE HIM.
BUT IN 1944,
THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT DICTATE THE CHOICE FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, HARRY TRUMAN'S FATE WOULD BE DECIDED
BY A GROUP OF POWERFUL DEMOCRATS MEETING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.
McCullough:
THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY
AND HIS OWN IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND FATE
ARE ALL IN THE HANDS OF FORCES BEYOND HIS CONTROL,
AND HE CAN'T BE ANYTHING BUT A KIND OF A CHIP
ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, BEING SWEPT ALONG.
Narrator:
AS THE CONVENTION GOT UNDERWAY,
THE DEMOCRATS PREPARED TO GIVE THEIR NOMINATION
FOR THE FOURTH TIME TO FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
MANY OF THEM ALREADY KNEW IT WOULD BE THE LAST.
THE PRESIDENT WAS ILL.
DIAGNOSED WITH HEART DISEASE,
HE HAD NEVER ASKED, AND WAS NEVER TOLD,
THE EXTENT OF HIS ILLNESS,
BUT THOSE CLOSE TO HIM WERE FRIGHTENED
BY THE DEATHLIKE PALLOR
THAT SHADOWED THE ONCE-EBULLIENT FACE.
Woman:
IT WAS NOT SPOKEN OF,
THE FACT THAT ROOSEVELT MIGHT DIE.
THAT WAS A DEEP, DARK SECRET.
IT WAS WARTIME, AND NO ONE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
THE PRESIDENT FAILING IN ANY WAY,
BUT I THINK THAT HAD TO BE BEHIND EVERYBODY'S MINDS.
Man:
IT WAS IN THE MINDS OF MANY DELEGATES
THAT WHOEVER WAS NOMINATED FOR VICE-PRESIDENT
COULD VERY WELL BECOME PRESIDENT WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
THE ENTIRE FOCUS OF THAT CONVENTION
WAS ON WHO WOULD BE NOMINATED FOR THE VICE-PRESIDENCY.
Crowd:
WE WANT WALLACE!
WE WANT WALLACE!
WE WANT WALLACE!
Narrator:
THE CURRENT VICE-PRESIDENT, HENRY WALLACE,
WAS THE MAN TO BEAT.
A CHAMPION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND LABOR,
HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH LIBERALS,
BUT CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS OPPOSED HIM.
MANY OF THEM TURNED TO JIMMY BYRNES FROM SOUTH CAROLINA--
A FORMER SENATOR AND SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
AN AVOWED SEGREGATIONIST, HE WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO LIBERALS.
(crowd chanting):
WE WANT WALLACE!
WE WANT WALLACE!
Narrator:
WITH THE DEMOCRATS DIVIDED,
PARTY LEADERS WERE SEARCHING FOR A COMPROMISE.
PARTY CHAIRMAN BOB HANNEGAN WANTED
NEITHER WALLACE NOR BYRNES.
Roll:
MY FATHER AND THE OTHER POLITICAL ADVISERS FELT
THAT JIMMY BYRNES WOULD BE A LIABILITY TO THE TICKET.
SOUTHERNERS WERE A DRAWBACK AT THAT TIME.
LABOR WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF HIM,
AND MY FATHER WAS VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT WALLACE AS A POSSIBLE PRESIDENT.
HE FELT THAT HE WAS SORT OF FLAKY,
AND FROM A POLITICIAN'S STANDPOINT
MY FATHER COULDN'T CONTROL HIM.
SO, MY FATHER FELT THAT TRUMAN WOULD BE SOMEWHAT BLAMELESS--
THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO REAL DRAWBACKS.
Hamby:
SO HE EMERGES AS A COMPROMISE CANDIDATE,
"THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE," SOME PEOPLE SAY.
HE HAS CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS, SOUTHERNERS LIKE HIM,
BUT HE'S BEEN A GOOD NEW DEALER.
HE'S GOT LABOR UNION CONTACTS.
HE EMERGES AS THE PERSON EVERYONE CAN AGREE ON.
IT WAS SIMPLY
ACTUALLY A DIPPING INTO ALMOST THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL,
YOU COULD ALMOST SAY, TO APPOINT AS VICE-PRESIDENT
AND TO SELECT AS VICE-PRESIDENT ON THE TICKET
A MAN WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST HIM.
(cheering)
Convention speaker:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CONVENTION...
Narrator:
UNKNOWN TO THE DELEGATES,
THE PARTY BOSSES WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE TRUMAN VICE-PRESIDENT.
TWO WEEKS BEFORE, THEY HAD MADE A TRIP TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
McCullough:
ONE JULY NIGHT IN 1944,
THE BIG BOSSES MET WITH FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT,
AND IT WAS A VERY HOT NIGHT, VERY HUMID,
WITH THE LONG FRENCH DOORS OPEN TO THE AIR
AND THE CURTAINS BLOWING IN WHAT LITTLE BREEZE THERE WAS,
AND THEY ALL SAT AROUND IN THEIR SHIRTSLEEVES, PERSPIRING,
TALKING ABOUT WHO OUGHT TO BE THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE.
AND THE BOSSES ALL SAID IT COULD NOT BE WALLACE,
IT COULD NOT BE BYRNES, AND IT OUGHT TO BE TRUMAN.
ROOSEVELT LATER TOLD HIS SON JIMMY
THAT, IN FACT, HE REALLY DIDN'T CARE.
HE WAS A TIRED, SICK, ILL MAN,
AND HIS MIND AND WHAT ENERGY HE HAD
WAS ALL CONCENTRATED ON THE WAR.
I THINK MY FATHER AND OTHER PARTY LEADERS DID THE CHOOSING
AND ROOSEVELT WENT ALONG WITH IT.
I DON'T THINK HE CARED AT THIS POINT.
I THINK IT WAS...
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN TO HIM.
IF IT HAD BEEN, HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN VERY WELL
HOW TO PUT THE MATTER TO REST.
Narrator:
THE MOST IMPORTANT DEMOCRATS
WERE NOW LINED UP BEHIND TRUMAN,
AND AT THE CONVENTION, BOB HANNEGAN TOLD THE SENATOR
THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WAS HIS.
Roll:
ONCE MY FATHER AND HIS FRIENDS
HAD PRETTY MUCH SET TRUMAN UP,
THEN THEY HAD TO CONVINCE TRUMAN THAT HE WAS GOING TO RUN.
AND HE WAS VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO IT,
AND HE SAID HE WOULDN'T DO IT.
McCullough:
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE PRESIDENT,
AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T WANT TO BE PRESIDENT
AFTER FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME IN
AND TRY AND HAVE TO FILL THOSE ENORMOUS SHOES.
HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS QUALIFIED
TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
HE WAS VERY HAPPY WHERE HE WAS, IN THE SENATE.
HE HAD GONE THROUGH THE TRAUMA OF THE PENDERGAST YEARS,
WHERE HIS NAME HAD BEEN RUBBED IN THE MUD,
ALONG WITH PENDERGAST'S MACHINE, AND IT HURT HIS FAMILY.
HE WAS A VERY DEVOTED FAMILY MAN.
McCullough:
BESS HAD NONE OF THAT KIND OF POLITICAL AMBITION.
SHE HAD NO DESIRE TO SEE HER HUSBAND BECOME PRESIDENT.
SHE CERTAINLY HAD NO DESIRE TO BE THE FIRST LADY.
SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE LIMELIGHT,
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT THE NOMINATION
WAS THE FEAR THAT HER FATHER'S SUICIDE WOULD BECOME PUBLIC,
THAT THE COUNTRY WOULD FIND OUT
THAT THIS DISGRACEFUL THING HAD HAPPENED IN HER PAST.
Narrator:
BUT THE MOMENTUM WAS BUILDING
TOWARD A TRUMAN VICE-PRESIDENCY,
AND BESS TRUMAN WOULD HAVE TO STAND ASIDE.
ON JULY 20, THE PARTY BOSSES SUMMONED TRUMAN
TO A SUITE IN THE BLACKSTONE HOTEL
TO LISTEN IN ON A PHONE CALL THAT, UNKNOWN TO THE SENATOR,
THEY HAD REHEARSED IN ADVANCE WITH THE PRESIDENT.
MY FATHER GOT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF, PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT,
TO CALL HIM ON THE LINE,
AND WHILE HE WAS ON THE LINE, HE LET TRUMAN LISTEN.
Narrator:
THE PRESIDENT'S VOICE BOOMED SO LOUD,
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM COULD HEAR:
"HAVE YOU GOT THAT FELLOW LINED UP YET?" THE PRESIDENT ASKED.
"NO," THE PRESIDENT WAS TOLD.
"HE IS THE CONTRARIEST GODDAMN MULE FROM MISSOURI
I EVER DEALT WITH."
"YOU TELL THE SENATOR," ROOSEVELT SAID,
"THAT IF HE WANTS TO BREAK UP THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR, THAT'S HIS RESPONSIBILITY."
AND THEN HE BANGED DOWN THE PHONE.
"WELL," TRUMAN SAID, PACING UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR,
"IF THAT'S THE SITUATION, I'LL HAVE TO SAY YES.
BUT WHY THE HELL DIDN'T HE TELL ME IN THE FIRST PLACE?"
Convention announcer:
HARRY TRUMAN HAS RECEIVED
MORE THAN A MAJORITY.
I DO NOW DECLARE HIM TO BE
THE NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR VICE-PRESIDENT
AND THE NEXT VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
(cheering)
Narrator:
ON FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1944,
HARRY TRUMAN ACCEPTED HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION
FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.
Roll:
I THINK HE WAS SOMEWHAT EXCITED.
I DON'T THINK MRS. TRUMAN WAS HAPPY AT ALL.
I DON'T RECALL HER EVER SMILING THE WHOLE TIME.
SHE WAS IN A BOX NOT TOO FAR FROM US,
AND I DON'T RECALL ANY SMILES DOWN THERE.
I THINK SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT IT.
THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE THAT I CAN SAY TO YOU
EXCEPT THAT I ACCEPT THE HONOR WITH ALL THE HUMILITY
THAT A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES CAN ASSUME
IN THIS POSITION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Narrator:
"AFTER DAD'S SPEECH," MARGARET TRUMAN LATER WROTE,
"WE WERE BESIEGED BY HORDES
"OF SHOUTING, SWEATING PHOTOGRAPHERS.
"EVERYONE WANTED TO TOUCH US.
"THANKFULLY, THE POLICE FORMED A KIND OF PHALANX AROUND US,
"AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET INTO A WAITING CAR OUTSIDE,
"WHERE MOM LOOKED AT DAD, GLARED AT HIM, AND SAID:
"'ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS
FOR ALL THE REST OF OUR LIVES?
'"
AS THEY HEADED BACK TO INDEPENDENCE,
BESS TRUMAN REFUSED TO SPEAK TO ANYONE.
Margaret:
DAD, HERE'S A NICE LETTER FROM MARION.
THAT'S NICE OF MARION.
I THINK MARION HAD A GOOD TIME IN CHICAGO.
HERE'S ONE FROM YOUR TEACHER, MISS CARR.
OH, MISS CARR.
MISS CARR.
AND HERE'S ONE FROM MR. BUDA FROM ST.
LOUIS.
LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS.
"PLEASE CONVEY MY CONGRATULATIONS
"TO YOUR LOYAL WIFE,
"CHARMING DAUGHTER AND DEAR MOTHER,
"WHOSE GREAT JOY AND HAPPINESS IS SHARED
BY THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS."
ISN'T THAT NICE?
THAT CERTAINLY IS.
Roll:
ONCE HE WAS IN IT, HE WAS ALL THE WAY IN IT.
SAY, DADDY, DON'T YOU WISH
YOU'D GONE FISHING LAST WEEK?
WELL, I DID GO
ON A SORT OF FISHING TRIP TO CHICAGO,
OR AT LEAST IT RESULTED THAT WAY.
HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A POLITICIAN HIMSELF
NOT TO GO FOR IT ALL THE WAY.
Narrator:
TRUMAN CAMPAIGNED
WITH HIS USUAL ENERGY AND DETERMINATION,
TRAVELING THOUSANDS OF MILES, SKIPPING MEALS,
WASHING HIS SOCKS IN THE BASIN OF HIS SLEEPING CAR.
Hamby:
HE'S DESIGNATED AS THE PARTY WORKHORSE.
"THIS DUTY HAS BEEN INFLICTED ON ME AND I'M GOING TO DO IT.
BUT I'M APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE FUTURE."
Narrator:
THE NIGHT THAT ROOSEVELT AND TRUMAN
WERE ELECTED,
HARRY TRUMAN COULD HARDLY SLEEP.
THE SENATE WILL COME TO ORDER.
Narrator:
THE VICE-PRESIDENT, TRUMAN WOULD SAY,
IS A "POLITICAL EUNUCH."
THE SENATE WILL COME TO ORDER.
Narrator:
HE PRESIDED OVER THE SENATE,
WRITING LETTERS HOME DURING THE LONG SENATORIAL DEBATES,
DROPPING BY FOR A LATE-AFTERNOON DRINK
WITH HIS OLD FRIENDS IN CONGRESS.
HE SEEMED WHOLLY UNAFFECTED BY HIS NEW TITLE--
"HOMESPUN AS EVER," ONE SENATOR REMARKED.
ONE AFTERNOON, AT A LUNCHEON AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB,
THE VICE-PRESIDENT SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO
TO PLAY THE "MISSOURI WALTZ."
Hamby:
SUDDENLY, A YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS, LAUREN BACALL,
PERCHES HERSELF ON TOP OF THE PIANO
FOR SOME PUBLICITY PORTRAITS,
SHOWING A RATHER DARING AMOUNT OF LEG BY 1945 STANDARDS.
TRUMAN DOESN'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THIS.
HE DOES WHAT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY INTELLIGENT THING TO DO,
WHICH WAS TO KEEP SMILING AND KEEP PLAYING THE PIANO.
Narrator:
FLASHBULBS EXPLODED.
THE AUDIENCE CHEERED.
THE PHOTOS WERE AN INTERNATIONAL SENSATION.
BESS WAS FURIOUS.
Hamby:
IT DID HAVE KIND OF A LOOSE ASSOCIATION
WITH THE IDEA OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT
BEING THE PIANO PLAYER IN A HOUSE OF ILL-REPUTE.
Narrator:
THROUGHOUT HIS VICE-PRESIDENCY,
TRUMAN WAS ALWAYS KEPT OUTSIDE ROOSEVELT'S INNER CIRCLE.
F.D.R. NEVER TOOK TRUMAN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE.
THE VICE-PRESIDENT MET ALONE WITH THE PRESIDENT
JUST TWO TIMES.
HE COULD NEVER SHAKE, TRUMAN SAID, THE FEELING
THAT THE ROOSEVELT WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERED HIM "SMALL POTATOES."
Hamby:
HE HAS WHAT YOU MIGHT ALMOST CALL
A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP
WITH ROOSEVELT BY THIS TIME.
HE ADMIRES HIM ON THE ONE HAND,
DOESN'T QUITE TRUST HIM ON THE OTHER HAND.
AND THE FACT IS THAT ROOSEVELT DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION
TO HIS NEW VICE-PRESIDENT.
Narrator:
EVEN WHEN THEY HAD MET FOR A PRIVATE LUNCHEON
AT THE WHITE HOUSE DURING THE CAMPAIGN,
ROOSEVELT TOLD TRUMAN NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE,
POSING FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS AND MAKING SMALL TALK.
McCullough:
AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT
THAT TRUMAN SAW ROOSEVELT CLOSE UP FOR THE FIRST TIME,
AND SAW HOW BADLY HE LOOKED--
SAW THE CIRCLES UNDER HIS EYES, SAW THE DROOP OF HIS SHOULDERS
AND NOTICED THAT WHEN ROOSEVELT WENT
TO POUR HIS CREAM INTO HIS COFFEE
THAT HIS HAND TREMBLED SO HE COULD HARDLY DO IT.
Narrator:
"I HAD BEEN AFRAID FOR MANY WEEKS
THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN," TRUMAN ADMITTED,
"BUT I DIDN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK ABOUT IT."
Man:
I THINK TRUMAN AND EVERYBODY ELSE AT ONE LEVEL KNEW
THAT ROOSEVELT WOULDN'T LIVE OUT HIS TERM.
BUT THERE WAS A SHARED DENIAL THAT WAS OVERWHELMING.
IT CAME FROM ROOSEVELT AND FROM TRUMAN.
SO THAT WHAT THE RESULT WAS
WAS THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PREPARATION
OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT BY A VERY SICK PRESIDENT
FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
AND TRUMAN, HE DIDN'T TAKE THE MOST MODEST KIND OF EFFORT
TOWARD IMAGINING HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT
AND PREPARING HIMSELF FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
Hamby:
HE TELLS A FRIEND OF HIS IN MISSOURI
THAT ROOSEVELT HAS THE PALLOR OF DEATH ON HIS FACE.
HE'S VERY WORRIED
THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE THE PRESIDENCY THRUST ON HIM,
AND THAT IT MIGHT HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT.
Narrator:
ON APRIL 12, 1945, TRUMAN RUSHED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WAS DEAD.
VICE-PRESIDENT FOR JUST 82 DAYS,
HARRY S. TRUMAN WAS NOW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND INSECURE.
"I'M NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR THIS JOB," TRUMAN SAID.
AFTER TAKING THE OATH, TRUMAN GATHERED HIS CABINET AROUND HIM.
HE BARELY KNEW THESE MEN.
NOW HE ASKED FOR THEIR SUPPORT.
SECRETARY OF WAR HENRY STIMSON REMAINED
WHILE THE REST SILENTLY DRIFTED AWAY.
"HE WANTED ME TO KNOW ABOUT AN IMMENSE PROJECT,"
TRUMAN WROTE LATER, "TO DEVELOP A NEW EXPLOSIVE
"OF ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE DESTRUCTIVE POWER.
"THAT WAS ALL HE FELT FREE TO SAY AT THE TIME,
AND HIS STATEMENT LEFT ME PUZZLED."
HARRY TRUMAN WAS PRESIDENT,
AND HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ATOMIC BOMB.
Narrator:
THE DAY AFTER FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT DIED,
PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN MET WITH REPORTERS.
"BOYS, IF YOU EVER PRAY, PRAY FOR ME NOW," HE TOLD THEM.
"I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU FELLOWS
"EVER HAD A LOAD OF HAY FALL ON YOU,
"BUT WHEN THEY TOLD ME YESTERDAY WHAT HAD HAPPENED,
"I FELT LIKE THE MOON, THE STARS AND ALL THE PLANETS
HAD FALLEN ON ME."
ON HIS FIRST FULL DAY IN OFFICE, TRUMAN SURPRISED EVERYONE
WITH HIS SHOW OF ENERGY AND CONFIDENCE.
Hamby:
OUTWARDLY, TRUMAN WORKS VERY HARD AT LOOKING CONFIDENT,
AT SEEMING TO BE IN CHARGE.
PRIVATELY, HE CLEARLY FEELS QUITE INSECURE
ABOUT HIS NEW ROLE.
HE LETS CLOSE FRIENDS AND CONFIDANTES KNOW
THAT THIS IS A TERRIBLE CHALLENGE HE FACES.
Narrator:
"I'M SCARED," HE ADMITTED TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER.
"MAYBE IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT."
HIS FIRST CHANCE TO PROVE THAT HE WAS UP TO THE JOB
CAME ON APRIL 16,
WHEN HE ADDRESSED A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS.
Announcer:
IN JUST A MOMENT, YOU'LL HEAR THE VOICE
OF SPEAKER RAYBURN AS HE INTRODUCES PRESIDENT TRUMAN.
Narrator:
ANXIOUS TO REASSURE AMERICANS, AND HIMSELF,
TRUMAN FUMBLED.
HE LAUNCHED IMMEDIATELY INTO HIS SPEECH,
AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AMERICANS LISTENING ON THE RADIO
HEARD THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE CORRECT HIM BY HIS FIRST NAME.
Truman:
MR. SPEAKER...
Rayburn:
JUST A MOMENT-
- LET ME PRESENT YOU, WILL YOU, HARRY?
MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS,
I HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HIGH PRIVILEGE
OF PRESENTING TO YOU THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
(applause)
(applause dies down)
IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM,
ALMIGHTY GOD HAS SEEN FIT TO TAKE FROM US A GREAT MAN
WHO LOVED AND WAS BELOVED BY ALL HUMANITY.
NO MAN COULD POSSIBLY FILL THE TREMENDOUS VOID
LEFT BY THE PASSING OF THAT NOBLE SOUL.
Narrator:
IN SPITE OF HIS NERVOUS SLIP,
THE SPEECH WAS A RESOUNDING SUCCESS.
AMERICANS EVERYWHERE WARMED TO THIS SEEMINGLY SIMPLE,
STRAIGHTFORWARD MAN FROM MISSOURI.
HIS SMALL-TOWN, FOLKSY MANNER STOOD IN STRIKING CONTRAST
TO THE PATRICIAN MANNERS OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT,
AND MANY AMERICANS FOUND THE CHANGE REFRESHING.
"AFTER A DIET OF CAVIAR," AN AIDE SAID,
"YOU LIKE TO GET BACK TO HAM AND EGGS."
Donovan:
HARRY WAS FRESH AND FAST AND DARTING ABOUT.
THE CONTRAST SORT OF HIT THEM.
TRUMAN WAS PEPPERY, AND HE'D WALK ALONG THE STREET
AND A TRUCK DRIVER, I REMEMBER ON ONE OCCASION,
SAID, "GOOD LUCK, HARRY!"
Narrator:
THE PRESS WAS SOON PRAISING HIM FOR HIS CANDOR,
AND CABINET OFFICIALS FOR HIS HARD WORK.
TRUMAN, MANY AMERICANS WERE SAYING, WAS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE.
Donovan:
THE THING I REMEMBER MOST IS HIS HANDSHAKE.
I NEVER FELT SUCH A HANDSHAKE.
IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME, THIS MAN HAD...
WAS A REAL DIRT FARMER.
HE WORKED BEHIND THE PLOW FOR TEN YEARS.
Hamby:
TRUMAN WAS THE ORDINARY AMERICAN DEMOCRAT, SMALL "D."
BUT DID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WANT SOMEONE WHO WAS SIMPLY ORDINARY TO LEAD THEM?
DID THEY BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE OF THAT TYPE COULD?
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT TRUMAN WOULD FACE
THROUGHOUT HIS PRESIDENCY.
Narrator:
WHEN TRUMAN TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE,
AMERICANS WERE FIGHTING THE GREATEST WAR IN HISTORY.
ALL AT ONCE HE WAS COMMANDER- IN-CHIEF OF 16 MILLION MEN
AND A TERRIFYING ARSENAL OF WARSHIPS, TANKS AND PLANES
ARRAYED AGAINST THE JAPANESE IN THE PACIFIC
AND NAZI GERMANY IN EUROPE.
BUT WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT WAR
CAME FROM HIS EXPERIENCE AS A SOLDIER IN WORLD WAR I
AND FROM BOOKS HE HAD READ AS A CHILD.
AMERICANS EVERYWHERE WONDERED HOW HARRY TRUMAN
WOULD END THE WAR, AND AT WHAT COST.
DURING TRUMAN'S FIRST DAYS IN OFFICE,
ALLIED ARMIES WERE SWEEPING TOWARD GERMANY--
THE SOVIET UNION CLOSED IN FROM THE EAST...
THE AMERICANS FROM THE WEST.
BUT WITH THE NAZIS ON THE VERGE OF SURRENDER,
TRUMAN FEARED THAT THE SOVIETS COULD NO LONGER BE TRUSTED.
THE WAR-INSPIRED ALLIANCE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND AMERICA
WAS BEGINNING TO COME APART.
ON APRIL 22, SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER VYACHESLAV MOLOTOV
PAID A CALL ON THE WHITE HOUSE.
MOLOTOV WAS A WILY DIPLOMAT,
A HARDENED VETERAN OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION.
TRUMAN HAD BEEN PRESIDENT FOR JUST TEN DAYS.
HE HAD NEVER NEGOTIATED A TREATY BEFORE,
NEVER MET A RUSSIAN IN HIS LIFE,
AND KNEW NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.
LaFeber:
TRUMAN WAS INSECURE AND IGNORANT.
IGNORANT NOT IN THE SENSE OF BEING UNINTELLIGENT--
THE MAN WAS VERY INTELLIGENT--
IGNORANT IN THE SENSE OF NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING ON.
BUT OF COURSE, NOBODY REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON
EXCEPT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, AND HE WAS DEAD.
THE MAJOR PROBLEM WAS THAT THE RED ARMY OCCUPIED
MUCH OF EASTERN EUROPE AND WAS DRIVING TOWARDS BERLIN.
AND CONSEQUENTLY, WHAT TRUMAN FACED WAS ESSENTIALLY
A RUSSIAN OCCUPATION OF EASTERN AND PART OF CENTRAL EUROPE.
Narrator:
SOVIET DICTATOR JOSEF STALIN
SAW THE COUNTRIES OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE
AS A BAND OF PROTECTION AGAINST ANY ATTEMPT TO INVADE RUSSIA.
TRUMAN FEARED STALIN WOULD USE THE RED ARMY
TO FORCE THEM TO BECOME COMMUNIST.
"WHOEVER OCCUPIES A TERRITORY," STALIN SAID,
"ALSO IMPOSES ON IT HIS OWN SOCIAL SYSTEM
AS FAR AS HIS ARMY CAN REACH."
WHEN TRUMAN AND MOLOTOV SAT DOWN TO TALK,
THE FATE OF EASTERN EUROPE STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE.
TRUMAN BELIEVED THE SOVIETS HAD ALREADY VIOLATED
AN AGREEMENT NEGOTIATED BY ROOSEVELT
GUARANTEEING FREE ELECTIONS IN POLAND.
THE NEW PRESIDENT DIDN'T HESITATE
TO TELL THE SOVIET MINISTER JUST WHAT HE THOUGHT.
Shulman:
TRUMAN GAVE HIM A TONGUE-LASHING--
"WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE BEHAVE?
WHY DON'T YOU RESPECT YOUR OBLIGATIONS?" AND SO ON.
AND, ACCORDING TO CHIP BOLIN, WHO TOLD ME ABOUT THIS,
WHO WAS THE INTERPRETER AND WAS ON THE SCENE,
SAID MOLOTOV, IN HIS STIFF WAY, DREW BACK AND SAID,
"I'VE NEVER BEEN TALKED TO LIKE THIS."
AND TRUMAN SAID TO HIM,
"WELL, YOU FOLKS BEHAVE AND YOU WON'T BE TALKED TO LIKE THIS."
TRUMAN THEN WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM,
SAW A TOP STATE DEPARTMENT AIDE
AND SAID TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT AIDE,
"I JUST GAVE HIM A STRAIGHT ONE-TWO TO THE JAW."
AND THEN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THIS MAN AND SAID,
"DO YOU THINK I DID RIGHT?"
Narrator:
"I'M HERE TO MAKE DECISIONS," TRUMAN SAID.
"WHETHER THEY PROVE RIGHT OR WRONG, I'M GOING TO MAKE THEM."
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, TRUMAN WOULD HAVE TO MAKE
ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE DECISIONS IN HISTORY.
WHILE NAZI GERMANY WAS CRUMBLING,
THE JAPANESE REMAINED A DANGEROUS, UNYIELDING ENEMY.
(explosion)
THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN OVER 50,000 AMERICAN LIVES,
AND MORE AND MORE WERE DYING EVERY DAY.
BUT AMERICA HAD BEEN DEVELOPING A WEAPON
THAT MIGHT FORCE THE JAPANESE TO SURRENDER.
JUST 13 DAYS IN OFFICE, TRUMAN WAS HANDED A MEMORANDUM
BY SECRETARY OF WAR STIMSON.
"WITHIN FOUR MONTHS," TRUMAN READ,
"WE SHALL IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE COMPLETED
THE MOST TERRIBLE WEAPON EVER KNOWN IN HUMAN HISTORY."
STIMSON WENT ON TO TELL TRUMAN
ABOUT THE SECRET SITE IN NEW MEXICO
WHERE SCIENTISTS HAD BEEN WORKING ROUND THE CLOCK
FOR THE PAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS TO FASHION A WEAPON
OUT OF THE ELEMENTAL FORCES OF THE UNIVERSE.
BUT IT WOULD STILL BE MONTHS, STIMSON SAID,
BEFORE ANYONE WOULD KNOW
WHETHER THE ATOMIC BOMB WOULD WORK.
(explosion)
(cheering)
Narrator:
ON MAY 8, TRUMAN'S 61st BIRTHDAY,
NAZI GERMANY SURRENDERED.
"ISN'T THAT SOME BIRTHDAY PRESENT?"
HE WROTE HIS 92-YEAR-OLD MOTHER.
NOW ONLY JAPAN REMAINED.
THE VICTORY WON IN THE WEST MUST NOW BE WON IN THE EAST.
THE WHOLE WORLD MUST BE CLEANSED OF THE EVIL
FROM WHICH HALF THE WORLD HAS BEEN FREED.
Narrator:
BUT TRUMAN FEARED THE JAPANESE WOULD NOT SURRENDER
WITHOUT A LONG AND BLOODY STRUGGLE.
ALREADY THEY HAD BEEN SEVERELY PUNISHED
AND YET SHOWED NO SIGNS OF YIELDING.
WHILE TRUMAN WAS VICE-PRESIDENT,
AMERICAN B-29s HAD RAINED THOUSANDS OF TONS OF BOMBS
ON THE ISLAND NATION.
FIVE WEEKS BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE,
AMERICAN PLANES DROPPED 2,000 TONS OF NAPALM ON TOKYO,
BURNING 16 SQUARE MILES OF THE CITY TO THE GROUND.
IN A SINGLE DAY, 100,000 JAPANESE WERE KILLED.
Man:
THE FIRE-BOMBING RAIDS
PREPARES THE WAY FOR EVEN MORE DEVASTATING BOMBING.
WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE WAR
IS A REDEFINITION OF WHAT IS A LEGITIMATE TARGET--
LEGITIMATE TARGET IS NOT SIMPLY A CITY,
BUT PEOPLE IN THE CITY WHO ARE PRIMARILY NONCOMBATANTS
IN WHAT IS A REDEFINED, VIRTUALLY TOTAL WAR,
SO THAT EVERYBODY BECOMES A TARGET.
Narrator:
THE BOMBING DESTROYED
NEARLY ALL OF JAPAN'S BIGGEST CITIES
AND KILLED MORE THAN A HALF A MILLION CIVILIANS.
STILL, THE JAPANESE FOUGHT ON.
McCullough:
TRUMAN KNEW THAT THEY WERE DEFEATED;
THEY KNEW THEY WERE DEFEATED.
THAT REALLY WASN'T THE QUESTION.
THE QUESTION WAS, WOULD THEY SURRENDER?
Narrator:
THE BATTLE FOR THE ISLAND OF OKINAWA, 350 MILES SOUTH OF JAPAN,
PAINTED A BLOODY PORTRAIT FOR TRUMAN
OF JUST HOW FEROCIOUS JAPANESE RESISTANCE COULD BE.
THE FIGHTING RAGED ON FOR MONTHS.
10,000 AMERICANS WERE KILLED, 27,000 WOUNDED.
AND ENTRENCHED IN THE JUNGLES AND CAVES OF THE ISLAND,
MORE THAN 100,000 JAPANESE SOLDIERS
WERE BURNED OR BOMBED TO DEATH RATHER THAN SURRENDER.
Lifton:
OKINAWA WAS A BLOODY BATTLE--
ONE OF THE BLOODIEST BATTLES OF A VICIOUS WAR.
AND OKINAWA WAS AN EXAMPLE
OF HOW MUCH OF A LAST-DITCH BATTLE
THE JAPANESE COULD PUT UP...
AND THE KIND OF BATTLE THEY MIGHT PUT UP
ON THEIR HOME ISLANDS, IN MAN-TO-MAN COMBAT.
SO OKINAWA COULD BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATOR
THAT JAPAN NEEDED DIRE MEASURES TO DEFEAT IT.
Narrator:
ON JUNE 1, WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR OKINAWA
REACHING A CLIMAX, TRUMAN RECEIVED A REPORT
FROM A COMMITTEE HE HAD APPOINTED
TO STUDY THE ATOMIC BOMB.
THE COMMITTEE URGED THE PRESIDENT TO USE THE WEAPON...
WITHOUT WARNING.
IT DID NOT RECOMMEND ANY ALTERNATIVES.
Bernstein:
THE USE OF THE BOMB WAS NOT A TOPIC OF DEBATE.
THE ISSUE WAS NEVER, SHOULD THE BOMB BE USED?
FOR US, THE BOMB, WHETHER WE APPROVE OR NOT,
IS A QUESTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED.
FOR THEM, LIVING HISTORY FORWARD AND NOT BACKWARD,
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND
IS THAT THE USE OF THE BOMB WAS NOT A QUESTION;
IT WAS AN ANSWER.
IF THE WEAPON COULD STOP THE KILLING,
THEN, IT WAS FELT, IT HAD TO BE USED.
WAS IT RIGHT?
WAS IT WRONG?
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE ISSUE.
I THINK THEY SAW IT AS NECESSARY.
Narrator:
TRUMAN DID NOT KNOW
THAT SOME OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO HAD HELPED CREATE THE BOMB
WERE NOW ACTIVELY ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT ITS USE.
THEY ADVOCATED A DEMONSTRATION BOMB
THAT WOULD CONVINCE THE JAPANESE TO SURRENDER.
THEIR PETITIONS NEVER REACHED THE PRESIDENT,
BUT IT IS UNLIKELY THEY COULD HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND.
I KNOW OF NO OCCASION
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMAN EVER SPOKE ABOUT DOUBTS
ON...
ON USING THE BOMB.
ALL HIS ADVISERS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION,
RECOMMENDED THE USE OF THE BOMB
JUST AS SOON AS IT WAS AVAILABLE.
AND HE AGREED WITH THEM.
Narrator:
BUT THE ATOMIC BOMB STILL REMAINED UNTESTED.
NO ONE KNEW IF IT WOULD WORK.
JUNE 18, TRUMAN AGREED
TO PLANS TO INVADE JAPAN IN EARLY NOVEMBER.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS
WERE RETURNING FROM THE BATTLEFIELDS OF EUROPE.
FOR MOST, IF THE INVASION WENT FORWARD,
IT WOULD BE JUST WEEKS
BEFORE THEY WOULD BE SENT BACK INTO BATTLE,
THIS TIME, FIGHTING THE JAPANESE.
McCullough:
WE WERE GOING TO INVADE THE HOME ISLANDS,
AND THE LOSS OF LIFE WOULD BE TERRIBLE.
AND FOR TRUMAN,
WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO BE 20,000 LIVES OR 100,000 LIVES
WAS NOT REALLY THE QUESTION.
THE QUESTION WAS TO STOP THE KILLING.
Hamby:
TRUMAN WAS ONE OF THE FEW PRESIDENTS OF THE 20th CENTURY
TO HAVE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED WARTIME COMBAT.
HE HAD SEEN CORPSES STACKED UP.
HE KNEW WHAT WAR WAS LIKE.
HE WAS VERY, VERY ANXIOUS TO GET WORLD WAR II OVER WITH
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
Narrator:
ONLY 30 DAYS IN OFFICE,
TRUMAN WAS STILL ADJUSTING
TO THE ANXIETIES OF BEING PRESIDENT,
STILL TELLING HIS ADVISERS THAT HE DIDN'T WANT THE JOB.
AND BESS NEVER WANTED TO BE FIRST LADY.
AFTER JUST ONE MONTH IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
BESS AND MARGARET WENT HOME TO INDEPENDENCE.
McCullough:
BESS DID NOT LIKE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
SHE FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, VERY ILL AT EASE
WITH ALL THE FANFARE AND THE ATTENTION OF THE PRESS.
PARTICULARLY WHEN PHOTOGRAPHERS PRESSED IN AROUND HER,
SHE WOULD FREEZE AND BECOME KIND OF "OLD STONE FACE"
AND GET AN EXPRESSION THAT LOOKED AS IF HER FEET HURT.
THE SPOTLIGHT, THE LIMELIGHT
DID NOT APPEAL TO BESS TRUMAN, EVER.
AND SHE WOULD RETURN HOME TO INDEPENDENCE
AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE,
LEAVING THE PRESIDENT FEELING VERY ALONE, OFTEN DESOLATE.
IT'S HARD FOR SOME PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT SHE WAS LIKE AND WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS SO DEVOTED TO HER.
BUT HE ADORED HER.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
Roll:
I THINK SHE WAS A VERY SHY PERSON,
VERY ILL AT EASE IN THAT KIND OF AN ENVIRONMENT.
WHEN SHE WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
SHE USED TO HAVE HER OLD BRIDGE CLUB
FROM INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI COME UP.
AND I THINK PROBABLY
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME SHE WAS REALLY COMFORTABLE.
THERE REALLY WAS NOT A GOOD NICHE FOR HER.
AND I DON'T THINK SHE EVER REALLY ENJOYED THE PUBLIC EYE.
(fanfare plays)
Narrator:
BESS TRUMAN'S FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE
CONFIRMED HER WORST FEARS.
Newsreel announcer:
AT THE NATIONAL AIRPORT,
AMBULANCES WITH WINGS-- ONE EACH FOR NAVY AND ARMY--
READY TO BE CHRISTENED BY MRS. HARRY S. TRUMAN
IN HER FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE.
BUT MRS. TRUMAN IS IN FOR A SURPRISE.
Mrs. Truman:
OH, DEAR!
(Mrs. Truman and crowd laughing)
(more laughter)
Announcer:
REFUSING TO BE RATTLED,
THE NEW FIRST LADY JOINS IN THE CROWD'S LAUGHTER.
BY AN OVERSIGHT, THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE, UNLIKE THIS ONE,
HASN'T BEEN PROPERLY PREPARED--
ETCHED TO BREAK THE GLASS ON IMPACT.
(laughter)
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
(cheering and applause)
Narrator:
TRUMAN SMILED WHEN HE SAW THE NEWSREEL,
AS DID MOST OF AMERICA,
BUT BESS IS SAID TO HAVE TOLD HER HUSBAND
SHE WISHED SHE HAD SWUNG THE BOTTLE AT HIM.
ON JULY 7, THE START OF HIS FOURTH MONTH IN OFFICE,
TRUMAN STEAMED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC
ON THE UNITED STATES CRUISER AUGUSTA.
DESTINATION:
POTSDAM, GERMANY.
"DEAR BESS, I SURE DREAD THIS TRIP
"WORSE THAN ANYTHING I'VE HAD TO FACE.
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE."
WITH SCIENTISTS AT LOS ALAMOS POISED TO TEST THE ATOMIC BOMB,
TRUMAN WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN A SERIES OF NEGOTIATIONS
THAT WOULD DETERMINE THE FATE OF THE POSTWAR WORLD.
HE HAD BEEN TO EUROPE ONLY ONCE BEFORE,
AS A SOLDIER ON THE WESTERN FRONT.
NOW HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
PREPARING TO MEET TWO OF THE LEGENDS OF THE 20th CENTURY--
WINSTON CHURCHILL AND JOSEPH STALIN.
"MR. GREAT BRITAIN" AND "MR. RUSSIA," TRUMAN CALLED THEM.
McCullough:
TRUMAN HAD TO STEP ONTO THE WORLD STAGE
WITH TWO OF THE MOST COLOSSAL FIGURES OF THE CENTURY,
TWO CONSUMMATE PERFORMERS, CONSUMMATE ACTORS,
WHO ARE VERY ACCUSTOMED TO COMMANDING THE STAGE.
AND WHO IS HE?
Narrator:
"DEAR BESS, THE PRIME MINISTER CAME
TO SEE ME THIS MORNING."
McCullough:
TRUMAN IS SUFFERING
FROM A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF STAGE FRIGHT.
HE KNOWS THAT CHURCHILL HAD BEEN FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY
WHEN HARRY TRUMAN WAS STILL PLOWING FIELDS BACK IN MISSOURI.
HE KNOWS ALSO THE AFFECTION, THE BOND
BETWEEN ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL
AND WONDERS IF EVER HE CAN ATTAIN THAT KIND OF RESPECT.
Narrator:
CHURCHILL LIKED TRUMAN,
BUT THE MAN FROM MISSOURI WAS NOT IMPRESSED
BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S FLATTERY.
"CHURCHILL GAVE ME A LOT OF HOOEY,"
TRUMAN WROTE IN HIS DIARY.
"WELL, I'M SURE WE CAN GET ALONG
IF HE DOESN'T TRY TO GIVE ME TOO MUCH SOFT SOAP."
FOLLOWING CHURCHILL'S VISIT, TRUMAN ASKED TO SEE BERLIN.
FOR MONTHS, THE GERMAN CAPITAL HAD BEEN
THE TARGET OF ALLIED BOMBS.
TRUMAN RECORDED HIS REACTIONS IN HIS DIARY.
"I NEVER SAW SUCH DESTRUCTION.
"I THOUGHT OF CARTHAGE...
"ROME...
BABYLON."
"WHAT A PITY THE HUMAN ANIMAL
"IS NOT ABLE TO PUT HIS MORAL THINKING INTO PRACTICE.
I FEAR THAT MACHINES ARE AHEAD OF MORALS BY SOME CENTURIES."
Man on intercom:
Eight, seven, six...
Narrator:
WHILE TRUMAN WAS TOURING BERLIN,
THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB WAS EXPLODED
OVER THE DESERTS OF NEW MEXICO.
Man:
...now.
TRUMAN RETURNED FROM HIS TOUR OF A DEVASTATED BERLIN
TO FIND SECRETARY OF WAR STIMSON, WITH A CODED TELEGRAM.
"OPERATED ON THIS MORNING," IT READ.
"DIAGNOSIS NOT YET COMPLETE, BUT RESULTS SEEM SATISFACTORY
AND ALREADY EXCEED EXPECTATIONS."
THE PRESIDENT NOW KNEW THAT THE ATOMIC BOMB WOULD WORK.
PLANS WERE ALREADY IN MOTION
TO DROP A SECOND BOMB AS SOON AS POSSIBLE...
THIS ONE ON JAPAN.
THE NEXT DAY, STALIN CAME TO CALL.
"A FEW MINUTES BEFORE 12:00," TRUMAN WROTE,
"I LOOKED UP FROM MY DESK
"AND THERE STOOD STALIN IN THE DOORWAY.
"I GOT TO MY FEET AND ADVANCED TO MEET HIM.
HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND SMILED."
ONE DAY, TRUMAN AND STALIN WOULD CONFRONT EACH OTHER AS ENEMIES
IN THE MOST DANGEROUS IDEOLOGICAL CONFLICT
IN ALL OF HISTORY.
BUT ON JULY 17, THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION
WERE ALLIES WHO HAD JUST DEFEATED A TERRIBLE ENEMY.
BOTH MEN WERE CORDIAL AND FRIENDLY.
Hamby:
TRUMAN WAS RATHER IMPRESSED BY STALIN.
HE THOUGHT THAT HERE WAS A TOUGH GUY.
STALIN STRUCK HIM AS FRANK AND STRAIGHTFORWARD--
A SORT OF POLITICAL BOSS TYPE
WHO WOULD KEEP HIS WORD ONCE HE GAVE IT.
Narrator:
TRUMAN SAID LATER THAT STALIN REMINDED HIM
OF THE MISSOURI KINGPIN TOM PENDERGAST.
McCullough:
JOSEPH STALIN WAS NOTHING LIKE TOM PENDERGAST.
THIS WAS ONE OF
THE MOST BLOODTHIRSTY, MURDERING, EVIL MEN OF OUR TIME.
BUT TRUMAN HAD THAT VERY AMERICAN IDEA,
THAT OLD AMERICAN IDEA
THAT IF HE COULD JUST MEET THE FELLOW,
SHAKE HIS HAND, LOOK HIM IN THE EYE, SIZE HIM UP,
THAT THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER, WORK THINGS OUT
AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY.
Narrator:
"I CAN DEAL WITH STALIN," TRUMAN WROTE.
"HE IS HONEST BUT SMART AS HELL."
STALIN WAS LESS SANGUINE.
HE TOLD AN AIDE THAT TRUMAN WAS WORTHLESS.
THE SOVIET DICTATOR HAD ALREADY DETERMINED
THAT HE WOULD SURRENDER NOTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCE
WHEN THE BARGAINING BEGAN.
THAT EVENING, JULY 17, TRUMAN, STALIN AND CHURCHILL SAT DOWN
TO DISCUSS THE FATE OF EASTERN EUROPE.
LaFeber:
THE SOVIET ARMY IS OCCUPYING
EASTERN EUROPE AND PARTS OF CENTRAL EUROPE
AND THE QUESTION IS:
HOW DO YOU NEGOTIATE THE RUSSIAN ARMIES
OUT OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE?
Narrator:
OVER THE NEXT 17 DAYS,
TRUMAN WOULD TRY TO CONVINCE STALIN
TO WITHDRAW HIS ARMIES AND ALLOW THE COUNTRIES OF EASTERN EUROPE
TO HOLD FREE ELECTIONS.
"DEAR BESS, THE FIRST SESSION WAS YESTERDAY.
"IT MAKES PRESIDING OVER THE SENATE SEEM TAME.
"THE BOYS SAY I GAVE THEM AN EARFUL.
"I HOPE SO.
"I WAS SO SCARED.
"I DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER THINGS WERE GOING ACCORDING TO HOYLE OR NOT."
WHILE TRUMAN WAS NEGOTIATING IN GERMANY,
THE ENOLA GAY, A SPECIALLY MODIFIED, LIGHTWEIGHT B-29,
WAS SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE ISLAND OF TINIAN,
FAR AWAY IN THE PACIFIC,
REHEARSING MANEUVERS TO DROP THE ATOMIC BOMB.
A LIST OF FOUR TARGET CITIES HAD BEEN PREPARED.
IT WAS NOW ALL BUT CERTAIN
THAT THE BOMB WOULD BE USED ON ONE OF THEM
WITHIN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS.
Elsey:
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INEVITABLE.
IT WAS A WEAPON THAT COULD BRING THE WAR
TO AN EARLY...
AN IMMEDIATE END.
AND IN MY VIEW, HAD ANY PRESIDENT--
TRUMAN OR ANYONE ELSE-- NOT USED THE BOMB,
THAT MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO IMPEACHMENT.
HERE'S A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT,
AND THE PLAN IS ABOUT TO MOVE ALL OUR ARMY NOW
INTO THE PACIFIC
TO INVADE JAPAN WITH WHO KNOWS WHAT CASUALTIES
AND YEARS LATER, THE PUBLIC-
- OR A FEW MONTHS LATER OR SOMETIME--
IT LEAKS OUT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD
A BOMB THAT WOULD HAVE ENDED ALL OF THAT.
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY?
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO TRUMAN?
LaFeber:
IT WAS QUITE CLEAR
THAT THE BOMB WOULD NOT ONLY SHORTEN THE WAR,
BUT IT COULD BE THE KIND OF WEAPON
THAT THE OTHER POWERS WITH WHICH TRUMAN HAD TO DEAL
WOULD BE IN AWE OF.
CONSEQUENTLY, THERE WAS NO QUESTION
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TRUMAN WAS GOING TO USE THE BOMB.
THE QUESTION WAS WHEN AND HOW AND WHERE.
Narrator:
AT POTSDAM, THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING NOWHERE.
THE FIRST THREE SESSIONS HAD ENDED IN STALEMATE.
ON JULY 19, IN THE SPIRIT OF THEIR WAR-INSPIRED PARTNERSHIP,
TRUMAN THREW A PARTY FOR CHURCHILL AND STALIN
AND FLEW IN TWO YOUNG AMERICAN G.I.s TO ENTERTAIN:
PIANIST EUGENE LIST AND VIOLINIST STUART CANIN.
Canin:
I WAS SO NERVOUS WHEN I STARTED TO PLAY.
I THINK I WAS SHAKING.
NOW, I'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL VIOLINIST FOR 50 YEARS,
AND I HAVE NEVER PLAYED FOR AN AUDIENCE LIKE THAT.
I MEAN, I COULD BARELY HOLD THE BOW ON THE STRING.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A LITTLE UPRIGHT PIANO,
BUT IT HAS KIND OF A BUM PIANO RACK
AND THE MUSIC WAS NOT STAYING PUT VERY WELL
AND TRUMAN LEAPED UP
AND HE JUST TURNED THE PAGES FOR GENE,
WHICH WAS QUITE EXCITING TO HAVE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TURN PAGES FOR YOU.
(playing classical music on piano)
Narrator:
ONE NIGHT, THE PRESIDENT SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO
AND PLAYED FOR CANIN AND LIST
A PIECE HE HAD PRACTICED FOR LONG HOURS
AS A BOY IN INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI.
Canin:
THE MAN HAD GREAT FEELING FOR MUSIC.
HE DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE TECHNIQUE TO DO WHAT HE WANTED,
BUT THE FEELING WAS THERE
AND YOU COULD SENSE THAT HE REALLY LOVED MUSIC.
HE SAID, "I WONDER
"HOW MUCH BETTER OFF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN
IF I HAD BECOME A CONCERT PIANIST."
AMAZING FOR A PRESIDENT TO SAY THAT.
McCullough:
HE TOOK MUSIC VERY MUCH TO HEART.
HE ADORED GOOD MUSIC.
HE ONCE WROTE TO BESS,
"DID YOU EVER HEAR AN OVERTURE PERFORMED BY A FINE ORCHESTRA
"AND IMAGINE THAT THINGS WERE AS THEY OUGHT TO BE
INSTEAD OF AS THEY ARE?"
Narrator:
ON JULY 21,
TWO DAYS AFTER TRUMAN'S PARTY FOR CHURCHILL AND STALIN,
THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED
A DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST OF THE ATOMIC BOMB.
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
HE BECAME FULLY AWARE OF ITS AWESOME POWER.
(explosion)
TRUMAN WAS TOLD THAT 13 POUNDS OF EXPLOSIVES HAD EVAPORATED
A STEEL TOWER 60 FEET HIGH,
LEFT A CRATER IN THE NEW MEXICAN DESERT MORE THAN TWO MILES WIDE,
KNOCKED DOWN MEN 10,000 YARDS AWAY,
AND WAS VISIBLE FOR MORE THAN 200 MILES.
TRUMAN WROTE IN HIS DIARY,
"WE HAVE DISCOVERED THE MOST TERRIBLE BOMB
"IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
"IT MAY BE THE FIRE DESTRUCTION
PROPHESIED AFTER NOAH AND HIS FABULOUS ARK."
"I HAVE TOLD THE SECRETARY OF WAR, MR. STIMSON,
"TO USE IT SO THAT MILITARY OBJECTIVES
"AND SOLDIERS AND SAILORS ARE THE TARGET
AND NOT WOMEN AND CHILDREN."
Hamby:
HE TELLS HIMSELF IN A DIARY ENTRY
THAT HE WROTE AT THAT TIME
THAT, "OF COURSE, THE BOMB WILL BE USED
"AGAINST A MILITARY TARGET,
"BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW BAD THE JAPANESE HAVE BEEN,
WE CAN'T KILL WOMEN AND CHILDREN."
BUT HE HAD TO HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING AT POTSDAM
THAT HE WAS KIDDING HIMSELF.
IT WAS WISHFUL THINKING.
Lifton:
HE'S AWARE THAT IT'LL BE MUCH MORE
THAN A MILITARY TARGET.
IT'LL KILL LARGE NUMBERS OF ORDINARY CIVILIANS.
BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER,
HE, LIKE ALL OTHER AMERICANS, SAW THIS AS A WAR AGAINST EVIL,
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF EVIL OUT THERE, REAL EVIL
ON THE PART OF THE NAZIS AND JAPANESE MILITARISM AND FASCISM.
IN THAT SENSE, HE CAN BELIEVE THAT THE BOMB IS JUSTIFIED
AND THAT THIS GREATEST WEAPON EVER DEVELOPED HAS A PLACE
IN OVERCOMING OR COMBATING EVIL.
Narrator:
THE DAY AFTER TRUMAN LEARNED OF THE BOMB'S POWER,
HE CONFRONTED STALIN WITH NEW CONFIDENCE.
SECRETARY OF WAR STIMSON WROTE IN HIS DIARY
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS "TREMENDOUSLY PEPPED UP."
IN HIS HIGH-STAKES GAME WITH THE SOVIET DICTATOR,
TRUMAN NOW HAD A NEW CARD TO PLAY.
LaFeber:
AND CHURCHILL LATER SAID THAT TRUMAN--
ONCE HE HEARD THE NEWS THAT THE ATOMIC BOMB WORKED--
WAS "A CHANGED MAN."
IT WAS QUITE CLEAR TO TRUMAN NOW THAT HE HAD,
AS HE WOULD LATER SAY, "AN ACE IN THE HOLE AND AN ACE SHOWING."
THAT IS TO SAY, THE ACE IN THE HOLE WAS A ATOMIC BOMB,
THE ACE SHOWING WAS AMERICAN ECONOMIC AND MILITARY POWER.
Narrator:
ON JULY 24, TRUMAN ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
AND WALKED SLOWLY AROUND THE TABLE
TO HAVE A PRIVATE WORD WITH THE SOVIET DICTATOR.
"I CASUALLY MENTIONED TO STALIN
THAT WE HAD A NEW WEAPON OF UNUSUAL DESTRUCTIVE FORCE,"
TRUMAN LATER WROTE.
"ALL HE SAID WAS THAT HE WAS GLAD TO HEAR IT, AND HOPED
WE WOULD MAKE 'GOOD USE OF IT AGAINST THE JAPANESE.'"
Elsey:
STALIN WAS SO BLAND AND SEEMINGLY UNCONCERNED ABOUT IT
THAT, ON THE AMERICAN SIDE,
THERE WAS SOME QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HE'D UNDERSTOOD
THE IMPORT OF WHAT TRUMAN WAS SAYING.
LaFeber:
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THAT STALIN KNEW
EXACTLY ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOMB
BECAUSE OF SOVIET SPIES AT LOS ALAMOS, IN NEW MEXICO.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS SOON AS STALIN WALKED OUT OF THAT ROOM,
STALIN IMMEDIATELY GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE MAN
WHO WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE SOVIET ATOMIC BOMB PROJECT
AND SAID THAT HE MUST GET TO WORK AND ACCELERATE THE PROJECT.
Narrator:
MEANWHILE,
THE PREPARATION TO BOMB JAPAN MOVED INEXORABLY FORWARD.
TWO ATOMIC BOMBS WERE NEARLY READY.
SEVEN MORE WERE ON THE WAY.
ON JULY 25, TRUMAN GAVE CONTROL OF THE BOMBS TO THE MILITARY
AND ORDERED THAT THEY BE USED
AS SOON AS THE POTSDAM CONFERENCE WAS OVER.
THE NEXT DAY,
THE JAPANESE WERE GIVEN ONE LAST CHANCE TO SURRENDER.
"WE CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN TO PROCLAIM NOW
THE UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER OF ALL THE JAPANESE ARMED FORCES,"
IT WAS ANNOUNCED FROM POTSDAM.
"THE ALTERNATIVE FOR JAPAN IS PROMPT AND UTTER DESTRUCTION."
THE ULTIMATUM WAS CALLED THE "POTSDAM DECLARATION."
TWO DAYS LATER, THE JAPANESE REJECTED IT.
Bernstein:
THE UNITED STATES WAS DEMANDING
AN UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,
AND IN PARTICULAR THAT IMPLIED THAT THE IMPERIAL SYSTEM,
NAMELY THE EMPEROR, WOULD BE TERMINATED.
TRUMAN HAD BEEN INFORMED BY A NUMBER OF HIS ADVISERS
THAT THE UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER DEMAND
MIGHT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.
TRUMAN RECEIVED ADVICE, ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS, TO PROVIDE
AN EXPLICIT PROVISION THAT THE EMPEROR COULD BE MAINTAINED.
TRUMAN DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE THAT PROVISION.
Lifton:
UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER HAD BEEN
A CENTRAL THEME INHERITED FROM ROOSEVELT.
IT EVOKED THE AMERICAN SPIRIT
OF FIGHTING AND WINNING THIS WAR AGAINST EVIL,
SO HE HELD TO IT.
Narrator:
JULY 31:
THE ATOMIC BOMB WAS NOW FULLY ASSEMBLED.
THE MOST DANGEROUS WEAPON ON EARTH
WAS WAITING TO BE RELEASED.
THE POTSDAM CONFERENCE LASTED 17 DAYS.
AS THE NEWSREEL CAMERAMEN TOOK THEIR FINAL SHOTS,
TRUMAN SMILED.
THE PRESIDENT REMAINED FOND OF STALIN.
HE WOULD LATER WRITE, "I LIKED THE LITTLE SON OF A BITCH."
BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.
LaFeber:
I THINK THE POTSDAM CONFERENCE CAN BE SEEN
AS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE RUSSIAN-AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP.
TRUMAN AND STALIN DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT TO SAY TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE.
THEIR ARMIES ARE ESSENTIALLY DOING THE TALKING.
Narrator:
THE ALLIES AGREED TO DIVIDE A DEFEATED GERMANY
INTO JOINT ZONES OF OCCUPATION,
BUT STALIN REFUSED TO WITHDRAW HIS TROOPS
FROM EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE AND PERMIT FREE ELECTIONS.
THE ISSUE WAS TABLED FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.
AT LAST, TRUMAN WAS HEADING HOME,
TRYING TO RELAX AFTER THE GRUELING ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS.
HE STROLLED THE DECK, ATTENDED CHURCH SERVICES,
ENJOYED A CONCERT BY THE SHIP'S BAND.
ON HIS FOURTH DAY AT SEA,
THE MISSION WHICH WOULD FOREVER MARK HIS PLACE IN HISTORY BEGAN.
Narrator:
AUGUST 6, 2:45 A.M.,
THE ENOLA GAY, CARRYING A FOUR-TON ATOMIC BOMB,
WAS HEADING OUT OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN TOWARD JAPAN.
SOME WOULD LATER ARGUE THAT JAPAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORCED
TO SURRENDER WITHOUT THE BOMB;
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE WARNED THE JAPANESE
WITH A DEMONSTRATION BOMB,
MIGHT HAVE BLOCKADED THEIR ISLANDS UNTIL THEY SURRENDERED,
MIGHT HAVE ASSURED THE JAPANESE
THAT THEY COULD KEEP THEIR EMPEROR.
TRUMAN WOULD LATER SAY
THAT TO END THE WAR QUICKLY WITHOUT INVADING JAPAN,
THE BOMB HAD TO BE USED
AND HE USED IT.
8:15 A.M.
THE ATOMIC BOMB DROPPED CLEAR OF THE ENOLA GAY.
43 SECONDS LATER, IT EXPLODED OVER HIROSHIMA.
(explosion)
HARRY TRUMAN WAS EATING LUNCH
WHEN HE WAS HANDED A DECODED MESSAGE.
"RESULTS:
CLEAR-CUT.
SUCCESSFUL IN ALL RESPECTS."
TRUMAN REACTED IMMEDIATELY.
"THIS," HE SAID, "IS THE GREATEST THING IN HISTORY."
Elsey:
THE CREW BURST INTO APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THIS WILL END THE WAR.
SINCE MOST OF THE CREWMEN WERE ANTICIPATING
THAT THEY'D HAVE TO GO OUT AND ENGAGE WITH THE JAPANESE,
YOU CAN SEE WHY THERE WAS GREAT GLEE ON THE PART OF THE CREW,
THE OFFICERS, EVERYONE...
EVERYONE PRESENT.
Narrator:
THAT AFTERNOON, TRUMAN ISSUED A WARNING
TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.
Truman:
IF THEY DO NOT NOW ACCEPT OUR TERMS,
THEY MAY EXPECT A RAIN OF RUIN FROM THE AIR
THE LIKE OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN ON THIS EARTH.
Narrator:
TWO DAYS LATER, SECRETARY OF WAR STIMSON
SHOWED THE PRESIDENT AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIROSHIMA.
TRUMAN DID NOT YET KNOW THAT THE ATOMIC BOMB HAD KILLED
MORE THAN 80,000 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AND THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE WOULD DIE
FROM RADIATION SICKNESS IN THE DAYS AND YEARS TO COME.
Hamby:
YOU SEE THESE PICTURES OF HIROSHIMA
JUST LEVELED FOR ALMOST AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.
CLEARLY, HE'S DISTRESSED BY THAT.
Narrator:
HE TOLD STIMSON,
"THIS PLACES A TERRIBLE RESPONSIBILITY UPON MYSELF
AND UPON THE WAR DEPARTMENT."
THREE DAYS AFTER THE ATOMIC BOMB WAS DROPPED ON HIROSHIMA,
THE SOVIET UNION DECLARED WAR ON JAPAN,
BUT STILL THERE WAS NO WORD OF SURRENDER.
(explosion)
AUGUST 9, 11:00 A.M.
A SECOND ATOMIC BOMB WAS DROPPED
ON THE JAPANESE SEAPORT OF NAGASAKI.
IN ONE-TENTH OF ONE-MILLIONTH OF A SECOND,
THE CITY WAS DESTROYED.
ANOTHER 40,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.
Hamby:
TRUMAN HAD NOT PUT ANY LIMITATION
ON THE USE OF THE SECOND BOMB.
ESSENTIALLY, AFTER HE SIGNS THE ORDER AT POTSDAM,
IT'S ALL ON AUTOMATIC PILOT
AND, UNLESS HE CHANGES HIS MIND, UP TO THE MILITARY.
Narrator:
THE DAY AFTER NAGASAKI WAS DESTROYED,
TRUMAN TOOK THE AUTHORITY TO USE THE ATOMIC BOMB
BACK FROM THE MILITARY
AND PLACED IT ONCE AGAIN IN HIS OWN HANDS.
(crowd cheering)
AUGUST 14.
THE SIMPLE REASON TRUMAN ALWAYS GAVE FOR USING THE ATOMIC BOMB
WAS TO END THE WAR AND SAVE LIVES.
NOW, AFTER NEARLY FOUR YEARS, JAPAN SURRENDERED.
THE WAR WAS OVER.
YEARS LATER, TRUMAN WOULD OFTEN SAY
THAT HE NEVER BROODED OVER HIS DECISION TO DROP THE BOMB.
"ONCE THE DECISION WAS MADE," HE WROTE LATER,
"I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT AFTERWARD."
Hamby:
TIME AND AGAIN, TRUMAN CLAIMED,
"I NEVER LOST A MINUTE'S SLEEP.
"I NEVER FELT ANY REGRET.
I DID WHAT HAD TO BE DONE."
BUT CLEARLY, THIS WAS A SOMEWHAT MORE UPSETTING EVENT
THAN HE LET ON.
Narrator:
THE DAY AFTER THE BOMB FELL ON NAGASAKI,
TRUMAN HAD TOLD HIS CABINET
THAT "THE THOUGHT OF WIPING OUT ANOTHER 100,000 PEOPLE
WAS TOO HORRIBLE."
HE HATED THE IDEA OF KILLING "ALL THOSE KIDS."
Bernstein:
YOU CAN NEVER FEEL COMFORTABLE
ABOUT KILLING 100,000 OR MORE PEOPLE.
AND I'M SURE THAT WAS TRUE FOR HARRY S. TRUMAN,
WHO FOUGHT VIGOROUSLY ALWAYS TO DENY IT.
Lifton:
HE WASN'T A MAN WHO COULD ALLOW SELF-QUESTIONING.
HE WASN'T A MAN WHO COULD ALLOW REFLECTION.
HE COULD NEVER REALLY TAKE IN FULLY WHAT HE HAD DONE
AND WHAT THAT MEANT FOR THE WORLD.
HERE WAS A GOOD MAN, A LOVING MAN,
WHO MADE A DECISION TO USE THE CRUELEST WEAPON IN HUMAN HISTORY
ON A DENSELY POPULATED CITY
AND SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE JUSTIFYING THAT DECISION.
Narrator:
"I MADE THE ONLY DECISION
I EVER KNEW HOW TO MAKE," TRUMAN WROTE.
"I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT."
Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org
Narrator:
IN THE FALL OF 1945, AMERICA WAS STILL CELEBRATING
THE END OF THE GREATEST WAR IN HISTORY,
AND HARRY S. TRUMAN WAS THE UNLIKELY LEADER
OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST NATION.
"NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS," TRUMAN WROTE,
"DID I EVER THINK OR WISH FOR SUCH A POSITION."
McCullough:
HE CAME FROM AN OBSCURE BACKGROUND
WITHOUT MONEY, WITHOUT THE PRIVILEGE OF EDUCATION,
WITH NO SENSE THAT HE IS A FIGURE OF DESTINY
TO BECOME IN HIS LIFETIME
THE MOST POWERFUL HUMAN BEING ON EARTH.
Narrator:
HE WAS ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE,
A FARMER UNTIL HE WAS 33,
A HABERDASHER GONE BANKRUPT AT 38.
NO ONE IN WASHINGTON HAD EVER HEARD OF HARRY TRUMAN
BEFORE HE WAS 50.
Man:
HERE WAS A LITTLE HABERDASHER FROM MISSOURI,
A SMALL BUSINESSMAN.
FOR HIM TO STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE GREAT F.D.R.,
THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS FEELING OF LETDOWN.
Narrator:
AMERICANS HAD DOUBTED HARRY TRUMAN
AND HARRY TRUMAN HAD DOUBTED HIMSELF.
BUT THEY HAD RALLIED BEHIND HIM, AND HE HAD LED THEM TO VICTORY.
BUT NOW, EVEN AS AMERICANS CELEBRATED,
THEIR PATRIOTIC HARMONY WAS BEGINNING TO COME APART.
TRUMAN WOULD FIND IT EASIER TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IN WAR
THAN TO GOVERN IT IN PEACE.
HE WOULD SAY, "SHERMAN WAS WRONG.
PEACE IS HELL."
Narrator:
12 MILLION G.I.s WERE COMING HOME.
THEY WANTED JOBS AND HOUSES AND CARS...
COFFEE, BUTTER AND MEAT ON THE TABLE.
AFTER YEARS OF GOING WITHOUT,
THEY LONGED TO GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES.
BUT HARRY TRUMAN KNEW
HE COULDN'T GIVE THEM ALL THEY WANTED.
Man:
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE A PRESIDENT HAVING MORE
ON HIS SHOULDERS THAN PRESIDENT TRUMAN DID
IN THOSE DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE WAR.
THE WHOLE THING CAME DOWN ON HIS HEAD.
THERE HAD NOT BEEN PLANNING VERY WELL ON POSTWAR POLICY,
BECAUSE THE ECONOMISTS HAD BEEN GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THE WAR MIGHT LAST UNTIL 1946 IN ANY CASE--
THE WAR WITH JAPAN.
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ATOMIC BOMB THREW EVERYTHING OUT OF KILTER.
Narrator:
FOR FOUR LONG YEARS, AMERICANS EVERYWHERE
HAD WORKED TOGETHER TO FIGHT AND DEFEAT FASCISM.
NOW THAT SPIRIT OF COOPERATION HAD VANISHED.
LABOR AND BUSINESS WERE ONCE AGAIN AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.
DURING THE WAR,
THE GOVERNMENT HAD KEPT A TIGHT LID ON WAGES AND PRICES
AND IN RETURN, THE UNIONS HAD AGREED NOT TO STRIKE.
NOW, THEIR PATRIOTIC SACRIFICE OVER,
WORKERS WALKED OFF THE JOB.
THEY WANTED HIGHER WAGES
AND THEY WANTED TRUMAN TO HOLD THE LINE ON PRICES.
Reuther:
THE EXPECTATIONS OF WORKING PEOPLE ZOOMED
BECAUSE THEY WANTED
TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THE YEARS THAT WERE LOST.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU KEEP PEOPLE IN A STRAITJACKET
FOR AS MANY YEARS AS THE WAR LASTED, YOU HAVE AN EXPLOSION.
Narrator:
TRUMAN WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP PRICES FROM RISING,
BUT FACING INCREASING PRESSURE FROM BUSINESSMEN
WHO WANTED TO SET PRICES THEMSELVES, TRUMAN WAVERED.
HE HELD THE LINE ON SOME PRICES AND LET OTHERS GO UP.
Man:
HE DOESN'T GIVE THE COUNTRY ANY SENSE OF DIRECTION,
AND HE COMES TO BE THE PERSON
THAT A PUBLIC FED UP WITH ONE STRIKE AFTER ANOTHER
BLAMES FOR LABOR DISORDER.
Narrator:
BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS DETERMINED
TO PROVE THAT HE COULD LEAD THE NATION, THAT HE COULD CARRY ON
IN THE TRADITION OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
ON SEPTEMBER 6, 1945,
TRUMAN PROPOSED AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE,
AID FOR HOUSING,
AND A BILL FOR THE FIRST PREPAID MEDICAL INSURANCE
IN THE NATION'S HISTORY.
BUT A COALITION OF REPUBLICANS
AND CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS
REFUSED HIM EVERYTHING.
THE PRESIDENCY, TRUMAN WROTE, WAS "LIKE RIDING A TIGER.
A MAN HAS TO KEEP ON RIDING OR BE SWALLOWED."
CHRISTMAS MORNING, 1945.
TRUMAN WOKE TO FIND THE CAPITAL COVERED IN ICE AND SNOW.
BESS AND MARGARET WERE IN INDEPENDENCE,
AND THE PRESIDENT MISSED THEM.
Man:
I'VE NEVER KNOWN AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO LOVED HIS WIFE AND HIS DAUGHTER
AND HIS FAMILY SO DEEPLY,
BUT THEY, OF COURSE, WERE ALWAYS INTERESTED
IN TRYING TO GET EXCUSES TO GO BACK TO INDEPENDENCE.
Narrator:
ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS FAMILY,
DESPERATE TO ESCAPE THE TURMOIL IN WASHINGTON,
HE ORDERED THE PRESIDENTIAL PLANE TO FLY HIM HOME.
EDITORIALS WOULD CALL THE FLIGHT "FOOLHARDY," "ABSURD,"
"ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS SENTIMENTAL JOURNEYS
EVER UNDERTAKEN."
THE PLANE, BUFFETED BY SLEET AND SNOW, ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE.
Hamby:
WHEN HE FINALLY GETS TO THE WALLACE HOUSE
ON DELAWARE STREET, BESS IS FURIOUS AT HIM
FOR TAKING SO LONG TO GET OUT THERE,
FOR TAKING, UH...
SUCH A BIG RISK.
Narrator:
THREE DAYS LATER,
BACK IN WASHINGTON, FORLORN, TRUMAN WROTE BESS A LETTER:
"WELL, I'M HERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE--
"THE GREAT WHITE SEPULCHER OF AMBITIONS AND REPUTATIONS...
"YOU CAN NEVER APPRECIATE WHAT IT MEANS TO COME HOME
"AS I DID THE OTHER EVENING
"AFTER DOING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THINGS I DIDN'T WANT TO DO
"AND HAVE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD
"WHOSE APPROVAL AND GOOD OPINION I VALUE
LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M SOMETHING THE CAT DRAGGED IN."
HE FINISHED THE LETTER, BUT BESS NEVER GOT IT.
HE LEFT IT TUCKED DEEP INSIDE HIS DESK DRAWER.
THE NEW YEAR BROUGHT A NEW WAVE OF STRIKES-- 5,000 BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OVER.
AS A DEMOCRAT, TRUMAN NEEDED UNION SUPPORT,
BUT HE HAD REMOVED THE LID ON PRICES,
APPEASING BUSINESSMEN, AND THE UNIONS WERE ANGRY.
THE COST OF ALMOST EVERYTHING SKYROCKETED,
AND WORKING MEN AND WOMEN DEMANDED
THAT THEIR WAGES KEEP UP.
AT ONE POINT, MORE THAN A MILLION WORKERS
WALKED OFF THE JOB AT THE SAME TIME.
TRUMAN BELIEVED THAT THE UNIONS WERE HOLDING THE COUNTRY HOSTAGE
AND PERSONALLY BETRAYING HIM.
Reuther:
WHILE HARRY SUPPORTED LABOR AND THE RIGHT TO STRIKE,
HE WAS NEVER HAPPY WHEN THERE WAS A STRIKE.
HE WAS SEEING IT AS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN,
AND IT COULD WRECK A SMALL BUSINESS.
HE JUST DIDN'T LIKE STRIKES OF ANY KIND
AND HE WAS VERY FRANK ABOUT THAT.
Narrator:
THEN, IN MAY, THE RAILWAY WORKERS WENT OUT,
FORCING THE COUNTRY TO A STANDSTILL.
TRUMAN WAS FURIOUS.
WHILE NEGOTIATORS SEARCHED FOR A COMPROMISE,
A FRUSTRATED TRUMAN PROPOSED
A SOLUTION NO PRESIDENT HAD EVER DARED:
HE THREATENED TO DRAFT THE STRIKING RAILWAY WORKERS
INTO THE ARMY.
THAT KIND OF A THREAT WASN'T EVEN MADE DURING THE WAR!
AND I THINK EVERYONE IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT
WERE QUITE SHOCKED BY THAT,
BUT THEY FELT, "WELL, THIS IS AN OFF-THE-CUFF TRUMAN THREAT,
BUT HE WON'T CARRY THROUGH ON THAT."
Narrator:
BUT TRUMAN STUCK BY HIS PLAN.
WHEN HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL QUESTIONED
ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY, TRUMAN TOLD HIM,
"WE'LL DRAFT 'EM AND THINK ABOUT THE LAW LATER."
McCullough:
IT WAS AS HIGH-HANDED,
AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL A MEASURE AS IMAGINABLE.
BUT HE MEANT IT, BECAUSE HE SAW THE COUNTRY BEING...
THE VERY LIFE OF THE COUNTRY AT STAKE.
Narrator:
NEVER BEFORE HAD THERE BEEN
A TOTAL NATIONWIDE RAIL STRIKE.
MORE THAN 17,000 PASSENGER TRAINS... 24,000 FREIGHT TRAINS--
NEARLY ALL OF THEM HAD STOPPED RUNNING.
THE COUNTRY WAS PARALYZED.
TELEGRAMS FLOODED THE WHITE HOUSE:
"ZERO HOUR IS HERE."
"WHO IS TO RULE OUR NATION?"
"WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND ACT IN THIS NATIONAL CRISIS?"
"LESS TALK AND MORE ACTION."
Hamby:
TRUMAN'S ANNOYED AT CRITICISM.
HE THINKS PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY ENOUGH,
AND MAYBE HE'S STILL GOT
THIS SNEAKING SUSPICION TO OVERCOME
THAT HE'S NOT QUITE UP TO THE JOB.
TRUMAN FACED EVERY NEW CHALLENGE WITH FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY.
THIS LEADS TO A BUILDUP OF ANGER
THAT ERUPTS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
WITH PARTICULARLY VIVID CONSEQUENCES IN THE PRESIDENCY.
Narrator:
DEEPLY TROUBLED, TRUMAN SAT DOWN AT HIS DESK
AND DRAFTED ONE OF THE STRANGEST SPEECHES
EVER TO COME FROM A PRESIDENT'S PEN.
"I AM TIRED OF GOVERNMENT BEING FLOUTED," HE WROTE.
"LET US GIVE THE COUNTRY BACK TO THE PEOPLE,
"HANG A FEW TRAITORS, MAKE OUR OWN COUNTRY SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY,
"TELL RUSSIA WHERE TO GET OFF...
COME ON, BOYS, LET'S DO THE JOB."
Man:
HE CALLED ME AND SAID,
"I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THIS SPEECH."
AND I STARTED OUT, AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD...
THIS IS THE WORST I EVER SAW."
I BELIEVE IT WAS HIS WAY OF LETTING OFF STEAM.
I FINALLY ASKED HIM, SAID,
"DO YOU INTEND TO GIVE THAT SPEECH?"
AND HE SAID, "WELL, NOT QUITE THIS SPEECH."
(Congress members applauding)
Narrator:
ON MAY 25, 1946,
EVEN WHILE NEGOTIATIONS TO SETTLE THE STRIKE CONTINUED,
THE PRESIDENT WENT BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS.
THIS IS NO LONGER A DISPUTE BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT.
IT HAS NOW BECOME A STRIKE
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF.
(applause)
I REQUEST THE CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY
TO AUTHORIZE THE PRESIDENT
TO DRAFT INTO THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES
ALL WORKERS WHO ARE ON STRIKE AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENT.
Clifford:
HE WAS GETTING TO THE CRESCENDO,
AND I GOT A CALL
THAT SAID, "THE RAILROAD STRIKE HAS BEEN SETTLED."
AND I WROTE ON A PIECE OF PAPER,
AND I TOOK IT TO LES BIFFLE, THE SECRETARY,
AND LES THEN TAKES IT UP.
ENORMOUSLY DRAMATIC.
WORD HAS JUST BEEN RECEIVED
THAT THE RAIL STRIKE HAS BEEN SETTLED
ON TERMS PROPOSED BY THE PRESIDENT.
(applause)
GREAT CHEERS, GREAT CHEERS.
AND IT WAS...
THEY WORKED OUT THE DETAILS AFTERWARD,
AND THE RAILROADS WERE RUNNING.
(train whistle blowing)
Narrator:
THE STRIKE WAS OVER,
BUT TRUMAN HAD PAID A HIGH PRICE.
HIS GUT RESPONSE HAD COST HIM
THE SUPPORT OF THE UNIONS HE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED.
Hamby:
THE LABOR LEADERS AND THE LIBERALS IN GENERAL ARE SHOCKED,
HORRIFIED, NOT WITHOUT REASON.
AND FROM THIS POINT ON,
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY, VERY TOUGH FOR TRUMAN
TO DRUM UP LABOR-LIBERAL ENTHUSIASM
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET IN THE '46 ELECTIONS.
Narrator:
THE 1946 MIDTERM ELECTIONS
WOULD BE, FOR TRUMAN, A DISASTER.
REPUBLICANS BLAMED THE PRESIDENT FOR AMERICA'S PROBLEMS
AND MOST AMERICANS SEEMED TO AGREE.
TRUMAN'S POPULARITY PLUMMETED.
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TRUMAN REALLY HITS ROCK BOTTOM
IN THE 1946 CAMPAIGN.
FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE
HE'S STILL VERY MUCH IN THE SHADOW OF F.D.R.
McCullough:
HE WASN'T COPING VERY WELL
AND PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO MAKE FUN OF HIM:
"TO ERR IS TRUMAN."
"I'M JUST MILD ABOUT HARRY."
THERE WERE PERIODS THERE
WHEN TRUMAN DIDN'T LOOK UP TO THE JOB.
REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY, YEAH, HE WAS A LITTLE MAN,
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, THE HABERDASHER.
Narrator:
THERE WERE SHORTAGES OF PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING:
BREAD, MEAT, HOUSING.
AND INFLATION WAS THREATENING TO UNDERMINE THE ECONOMY.
PRICES HAD SHOT UP SIX PERCENT IN A SINGLE MONTH.
Man:
WHAT THIS MEANT
WAS THAT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF POTENTIAL DEMOCRATIC VOTERS,
PEOPLE WHO HAD VOTED FOR ROOSEVELT,
THEY SAID, "TO HECK WITH IT;
THEY BUNGLED IT."
AND THE REPUBLICANS SAID, "HAD ENOUGH?"
THAT WAS THEIR SLOGAN.
PEOPLE AGREED WITH THEM.
TRUMAN GETS BLAMED.
THEY STAY HOME.
THE REPUBLICANS SWEEP TO POWER.
Narrator:
THE REPUBLICANS WON CONTROL OF THE SENATE,
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, EVEN THE STATE GOVERNORSHIPS.
Lichtenstein:
THE ELECTIONS OF '46 WERE A REPUBLICAN SWEEP,
A HUGE TURNAROUND, AND WHY?
NOT BECAUSE EVERYONE VOTED REPUBLICAN,
BUT BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS, THE NEW DEALERS,
THE LABOR PEOPLE-- THEY STAYED HOME.
Narrator:
DISCREDITED BY HIS OWN PARTY,
VOTED DOWN BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
HARRY TRUMAN, PUNDITS WERE SAYING, WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT.
THE DISASTROUS ELECTION OVER,
TRUMAN FLED TO HIS VACATION HIDEAWAY ON FLORIDA'S KEY WEST.
"DEAR BESS, I'M SEEING NO OUTSIDERS.
"I DON'T GIVE A DAMN HOW PUT OUT THEY GET.
"I'M DOING AS I DAMN PLEASE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS
"AND TO HELL WITH ALL OF THEM.
"THE ONLY REGRET I HAVE IS THAT YOU ARE NOT HERE.
"YOU KNOW, I GUESS I'M A DAMN FOOL,
"BUT I'M HAPPIER WHEN I CAN SEE YOU.
"EVEN WHEN YOU GIVE ME HELL,
I'D RATHER HAVE YOU AROUND THAN NOT."
BESS CONTINUED TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS SHE COULD
IN INDEPENDENCE.
WHEN ASKED HOW IT FELT TO BE FIRST LADY, SHE REPLIED,
"SO-SO."
SHE LOOKED, HER HUSBAND SAID APPROVINGLY,
"EXACTLY AS A WOMAN OF HER AGE SHOULD LOOK."
WHEN BESS AND HARRY TRUMAN
HAD FIRST MOVED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE,
BESS'S MOTHER, MADGE WALLACE, HAD MOVED IN, TOO.
AFTER MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY,
SHE CONTINUED TO CALL HER SON-IN-LAW "MR. TRUMAN."
SHE DIDN'T CARE MUCH FOR THE PRESIDENT, SHE NEVER DID.
THAT WAS, I GUESS, THE THING THAT STICKS OUT IN MY MIND.
SHE WAS A LOVELY LADY,
BUT SHE JUST NEVER, NEVER...
WE COULD NEVER FIGURE IT OUT
WHY SHE JUST DIDN'T CARE FOR THE PRESIDENT.
Man:
I THINK THAT SHE FELT THAT MISS BESS WAS ABOVE HIM.
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS PRESIDENT, HE WAS BENEATH MISS BESS.
HE WAS A FAILURE IN HIS HABERDASHERY.
SHE WOULD TELL YOU.
OH, SHE DIDN'T MIND TELLING YOU
THAT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
THAT SHE DIDN'T CARE MUCH FOR HIM OR FOR HIS MOTHER.
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS.
Narrator:
AS 1947 BEGAN,
HARRY TRUMAN HAD BEEN PRESIDENT FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS.
HUMILIATED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS,
HE HAD LITTLE HOPE OF ADVANCING THE LEGACY
OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL
THROUGH THE STUBBORN, REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED CONGRESS.
BUT IN THE TWO YEARS TO COME,
THE PRESIDENT WHO HAD BEEN REJECTED AT HOME
WOULD MAKE DECISIONS THAT WOULD DETERMINE THE FATE OF THE WORLD
FOR THE NEXT HALF CENTURY.
EUROPE WAS DEVASTATED.
THE WAR HAD LEFT A CONTINENT IN RUINS.
AS POVERTY AND STARVATION SPREAD,
CHAOS THREATENED TO OVERWHELM THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES.
SOME FEARED THE ELECTION OF COMMUNIST GOVERNMENTS;
OTHERS, STALIN AND THE RED ARMY.
THE RUSSIAN DICTATOR REMAINED AN ENIGMA,
HIS INTENTIONS UNCLEAR.
STALIN DID NOT YET HAVE THE ATOMIC BOMB,
BUT THE SOVIET UNION WAS A GREAT MILITARY POWER,
ITS ARMIES SPREAD ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE,
POISED TO ENFORCE STALIN'S WILL.
AT POTSDAM, TRUMAN HAD BEEN IMPRESSED WITH STALIN,
EVEN LIKED THE MAN.
WHEN THE WAR ENDED, THE PRESIDENT, LIKE MOST AMERICANS,
HAD CLUNG TO THE HOPE
THAT STALIN WOULD NOT IMPOSE COMMUNISM ON EASTERN EUROPE.
BUT TRUMAN'S OPTIMISM DWINDLED AS HE SAW POLAND, ROMANIA,
YUGOSLAVIA, BULGARIA, EAST GERMANY
FALL BEHIND A COMMUNIST IRON CURTAIN.
MANY AMERICANS STILL ARGUED
THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE NOT A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES.
BUT IN THE BEGINNING OF 1946,
TRUMAN SAID HE WAS GROWING TIRED BABYING THE SOVIETS.
"I DO NOT THINK WE COULD PLAY COMPROMISE ANY LONGER,"
HE WROTE HIS SECRETARY OF STATE.
"UNLESS RUSSIA IS FACED WITH AN IRON FIST,
ANOTHER WAR IS IN THE MAKING."
ONE MONTH LATER, STALIN DECLARED
THAT COMMUNISM AND CAPITALISM WERE INCOMPATIBLE.
HE CALLED WAR INEVITABLE.
RUSSIA AND AMERICA WERE MOVING INTO TWO OPPOSING CAMPS.
THE TURNING POINT CAME IN GREECE AND TURKEY,
WHERE TRUMAN FEARED FURTHER COMMUNIST EXPANSION.
IN A CIVIL WAR IN GREECE,
GREEK COMMUNISTS THREATENED TO TOPPLE THE MONARCHY.
IN TURKEY, THE SOVIET UNION WAS DEMANDING CONTROL
OF THE STRATEGIC DARDANELLES STRAITS.
TWO LOCAL CONFLICTS WOULD BECOME THE CATALYST
FOR A WORLDWIDE STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM.
Man:
I THINK AT THIS POINT,
TRUMAN BEGINS TO SEE STALIN AS AN EXPANSIONIST DICTATOR.
AND AT THAT POINT YOU CAN BEGIN TO SEE TRUMAN CHANGE
AND BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY THING THAT THE SOVIETS UNDERSTAND,
AS HE SAYS, IS STRENGTH, NOT NEGOTIATIONS.
Narrator:
TRUMAN HAD CHANGED HIS MIND.
NOW HE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE MINDS
OF STILL-AMBIVALENT AMERICANS.
HE WOULD HAVE TO CONVINCE CONGRESS
THAT A CRISIS IN TWO FARAWAY COUNTRIES
THREATENED THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES,
THAT $400 MILLION IN MILITARY AID WAS NEEDED
TO SAVE GREECE AND TURKEY.
LaFeber:
TRUMAN HAD TO GO TO THIS REPUBLICAN CONGRESS
THAT HAD GOTTEN INTO POWER IN THE ELECTIONS OF 1946
BY PROMISING TO CUT TAXES AND TO CUT AID OVERSEAS.
TRUMAN WAS NOW GOING TO HAVE TO GO
TO THESE PENNY-PINCHING REPUBLICANS
AND GET $400 MILLION.
THE QUESTION WAS, HOW DID YOU DO THIS?
Narrator:
UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE DEAN ACHESON HAD THE ANSWER.
ACHESON WOULD ONE DAY BECOME SECRETARY OF STATE
AND TRUMAN WOULD CALL HIM HIS "TOP BRAIN MAN" IN THE CABINET.
IN 1947, ACHESON, TRUMAN
AND SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE MARSHALL GATHERED TOGETHER
A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MEN IN CONGRESS,
AND ACHESON LAID OUT TRUMAN'S REQUEST FOR AID
IN THE STARKEST TERMS.
Man:
IF YOU WANT THE CONGRESS TO SUPPORT
THE APPROPRIATIONS NEEDED,
THERE HAS TO BE A BIT OF A CRISIS ATMOSPHERE.
AND SO ACHESON MADE A VERY IMPASSIONED SPEECH
AND HE LAID IT ON VERY HEAVILY
ABOUT HOW THE RUSSIANS WOULD SWEEP ACROSS EUROPE.
LaFeber:
WHAT ACHESON SAID WAS
IF THE SOVIETS COULD WIN IN GREECE AND IN TURKEY,
THEN THEY WOULD BE IN A POSITION
WHERE THERE WOULD BE SOVIET PRESSURE ON ITALY,
ON THE MEDITERRANEAN.
ONCE THAT PRESSURE WAS ESTABLISHED,
THERE WOULD BE PRESSURE ON WESTERN EUROPE
AND PRETTY SOON THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE STANDING ALONE.
SENATOR VANDENBERG, WHO WAS A LEADER OF THE REPUBLICANS,
SAID TO ACHESON AND TO TRUMAN,
"IF YOU CAN GET THAT KIND OF A VIEW ACROSS
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE'LL SUPPORT YOU."
LaFeber:
THERE WAS THE STORY THAT VANDENBERG SAID TO TRUMAN,
"MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SCARE HELL
OUT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."
WHETHER OR NOT VANDENBERG SAID THAT,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HARRY TRUMAN DID.
Newsreel narrator:
PRESIDENT HARRY S. TRUMAN COMES
BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS
TO MAKE A MOMENTOUS ANNOUNCEMENT.
A TENSE ATMOSPHERE PREVAILS, FOR THE NATION'S LAWMAKERS REALIZE
THAT THIS MAY BE THE CURTAIN RAISER FOR EVENTS
THAT WILL SHAPE THE DESTINY OF AMERICA AND THE WORLD.
Truman:
THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION WHICH CONFRONTS THE WORLD TODAY
NECESSITATES MY APPEARANCE
BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS.
I BELIEVE THAT IT MUST BE THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES
TO SUPPORT FREE PEOPLES WHO ARE RESISTING ATTEMPTED SUBJUGATION
BY ARMED MINORITIES OR BY OUTSIDE PRESSURES.
Man:
HE WAS REMINDING AMERICANS OF WHAT GRADUALLY
HAD BEEN SINKING INTO THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS,
THAT THE AIM OF THE SOVIET UNION
WAS TO EXPAND ITS HEGEMONY OVER AS MUCH OF THE WORLD
AS IT POSSIBLY COULD, AND THAT WAS NOT TO BE PERMITTED.
WE WOULD HELP FREE PEOPLES MAINTAIN THEIR FREEDOM.
IF WE FALTER IN OUR LEADERSHIP,
WE MAY ENDANGER THE PEACE OF THE WORLD
AND WE SHALL SURELY ENDANGER THE WELFARE OF THIS NATION.
(applause)
LaFeber:
TRUMAN, THE MIDWESTERN POLITICIAN, UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY
HOW YOU SELL THESE KINDS OF THINGS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
BECAUSE WHAT HE DID WAS TO GIVE A DEFINITION TO THE WORLD
THAT AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND
AND WHICH THEY COULD BECOME COMMITTED TO,
BECAUSE WHAT TRUMAN SAID WAS,
"THE WORLD IS ESSENTIALLY NOW DIVIDED IN TWO.
"ON ONE SIDE
"ARE THE TOTALITARIAN AND THE ENSLAVED PEOPLES.
ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THE FREE PEOPLES."
HE THEN LOOKED AT THE REPUBLICANS
AND SAID, "WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON?
"IF YOU ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE FREE PEOPLES,
GIVE ME THE $400 MILLION."
THAT PUT THE REPUBLICANS IN A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE POSITION,
WHICH IS EXACTLY, OF COURSE,
WHAT ACHESON AND TRUMAN HAD IN MIND,
AND TRUMAN GOT HIS $400 MILLION WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS.
Newsreel announcer:
PRESIDENT TRUMAN SIGNS THE BILL
FOR $400 MILLION AID TO GREECE AND TURKEY.
Narrator:
THE PRESIDENT HAD COMMITTED AMERICANS TO A BATTLE
AGAINST COMMUNISM ALL ACROSS THE WORLD.
THE POLICY BECAME KNOWN AS THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE.
Man:
I WAS SCARED BY IT.
I WONDERED HOW FAR-REACHING THIS WAS GOING TO BE.
WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN?
THIS IS A SWEEPING, SWEEPING DECISION
ASKING FOR AN OPEN-ENDED FAITH IN A POLICY
OF PROTECTING THE FREE PEOPLE AND BRINGING FREEDOM
WHERE IT DIDN'T EXIST AROUND THE WORLD.
AND THAT WAS THE...
THAT HAS NO LIMITS-
- HAD NO LIMITS,
AND IT WAS AWFULLY HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THOSE LIMITS WERE.
Shulman:
IT LED TO A MORE ABSOLUTE VIEW OF THE CONFLICT.
AND I ONCE REMONSTRATED WITH ACHESON ABOUT THIS
IN MY INNOCENCE-- I WAS VERY YOUNG THEN--
AND HE MADE IT CLEAR TO ME THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET THINGS DONE,
YOU HAVE TO GET CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT,
AND YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO GET IT.
AND THIS WAS ESSENTIALLY WHAT CAME TO BE
THE LANGUAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
IT BECAME MORE AND MORE ALARMIST.
Narrator:
THE PRESIDENT WOULD RESIST COMMUNIST AGGRESSION ABROAD.
HE HAD ISSUED A DECLARATION OF COLD WAR.
BUT IN WESTERN EUROPE, THERE WAS MORE TO FEAR
FROM STARVATION AND CHAOS THAN FROM THE RED ARMY.
IT HAD BEEN THE WORST WINTER IN LIVING MEMORY.
THE WAR HAD BEEN OVER FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS,
AND WESTERN EUROPE SEEMED ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE.
LaFeber:
IF WESTERN EUROPE WAS NOT HELPED, AND QUICKLY,
MASS STARVATION WOULD BREAK OUT, AND THERE WAS THE REAL DANGER
THAT WESTERN EUROPE WOULD BEGIN MOVING TO THE LEFT VERY RAPIDLY.
THE ANALYSIS MADE WITHIN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AT THIS POINT
INDICATED THAT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS WAS NOT MILITARILY.
THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS WAS ECONOMICALLY,
TO PUMP IN BETWEEN EIGHT AND 17 BILLION DOLLARS
SO THAT THE EUROPEANS WOULD HAVE THE MONEY
TO BUY FOOD FROM THE UNITED STATES--
FOOD AND OTHER RESOURCES.
Narrator:
TRUMAN HAD ALREADY MANAGED TO PERSUADE A RELUCTANT CONGRESS
TO GIVE HIM $400 MILLION FOR THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE.
NOW HE CONVINCED CONGRESS TO GIVE HIM $13 BILLION MORE.
NO PRESIDENT HAD EVER RECEIVED SO MUCH MONEY
TO AID PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T AMERICANS.
HE CALLED HIS ECONOMIC AID PROGRAM THE MARSHALL PLAN
AFTER HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, GEORGE MARSHALL,
A MAN WHO COMMANDED THE RESPECT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
Elsey:
SOME OF THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF SUGGESTED
TO PRESIDENT TRUMAN THAT THEY DIDN'T MUCH LIKE THIS IDEA
OF GENERAL MARSHALL GETTING CREDIT FOR IT.
TRUMAN WAS VERY FIRM ON THAT.
"THE CONGRESS WILL DO ANYTHING THAT GEORGE MARSHALL WANTS.
"IF MY NAME IS ON IT,
"IT PROBABLY WILL BECOME CONTROVERSIAL.
"I DON'T WANT IT TO BECOME CONTROVERSIAL.
"I WANT IT TO SUCCEED.
"IT'S THE MARSHALL PLAN.
WE'LL HAVE NO MORE TALK ABOUT CHANGING THE NAME."
LaFeber:
TRUMAN WOULD LATER SAY
THAT THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE AND THE MARSHALL PLAN
WERE TWO HALVES OF THE SAME WALNUT.
THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE WAS
THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL COMMITMENT.
THE MARSHALL PLAN WAS THE $13 BILLION, FINALLY,
IN ECONOMIC COMMITMENT
TO REBUILD WHAT TRUMAN CALLED "THE FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD."
IT BECAME VERY POPULAR VERY QUICKLY.
NO ONE EXPECTED THAT SORT OF ALTRUISM,
THAT SORT OF SWEEPING THING COMING OUT OF US.
THIS WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN ANYBODY HAD REALIZED.
Donovan:
A GREAT APPEAL OF THE MARSHALL PLAN WAS
THAT THESE BILLIONS THAT WERE BEING APPROPRIATED
WERE BEING SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES
TO FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS.
THAT MONEY WASN'T SPENT IN EUROPE.
IT WAS SPENT HERE, AND THAT WAS A GREAT APPEAL TO CONGRESS.
Reuther:
THIS WAS A TERRIBLY IMPORTANT DECISION.
ALSO, IT WAS A COMPASSIONATE ONE, AND UNDERSTOOD AS SUCH.
IT WAS A REAL BADGE OF HONOR FOR HARRY TRUMAN.
(cheering)
Narrator:
WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS RESCUING EUROPE
AND MOBILIZING AMERICANS TO FIGHT COMMUNISM OVERSEAS,
REPUBLICANS CHARGED THAT THERE WERE COMMUNISTS HERE AT HOME--
IN TRUMAN'S OWN ADMINISTRATION.
IN THE '30s, REPUBLICANS HAD CLAIMED
THAT THERE WERE COMMUNISTS IN ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL.
NOW THEY WERE DEMANDING THAT TRUMAN TAKE ACTION.
Clifford:
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF PRESSURES DEVELOPING
ABOUT COMMUNISTS INFILTRATING OUR WHOLE SYSTEM,
AND HE FELT OBLIGED TO DO SOMETHING.
HE DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WERE DISLOYAL EMPLOYEES.
HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT.
HE SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, "OUR ENEMY IS ABROAD.
OUR ENEMY IS NOT HERE AT HOME."
LaFeber:
TRUMAN IS IN A TERRIBLE POSITION HERE,
BECAUSE IF HE HAD NOT DONE ANYTHING,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OPEN TO THE ACCUSATION
THAT HE WAS TOUGH ON COMMUNISM ABROAD
BUT HE WAS OVERLOOKING COMMUNISTS
WITHIN HIS OWN GOVERNMENT, WHATEVER FEW THERE WERE.
Narrator:
ON MARCH 21, 1947, AGAINST HIS OWN BETTER JUDGMENT,
THE PRESIDENT ISSUED AN EXTRAORDINARY EXECUTIVE ORDER:
HE ESTABLISHED A LOYALTY PROGRAM,
MAKING THE POLITICAL BELIEFS OF EVERY FEDERAL EMPLOYEE
SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATION BY THE F.B.I.
Woman:
TRUMAN, TRYING TO MOBILIZE PUBLIC OPINION
FOR THE COLD WAR,
EXAGGERATED THE COMMUNIST MENACE.
HE PRESENTED THE COLD WAR AS A KIND OF CRUSADE
AGAINST COMMUNIST TOTALITARIANISM.
AND YOU DON'T BREAK UP YOUR CRUSADE
INTO "THIS IS THE EUROPEAN PART-
- WE'LL FOCUS ON THIS,
AND LET'S NOT LOOK AT THE AMERICAN PART."
IT WAS A TOTAL CRUSADE.
Narrator:
HARRY TRUMAN WAS LEADING AMERICA
IN A NEW KIND OF WAR, AND HE PREPARED THE COUNTRY
AS IT HAD NEVER BEEN PREPARED BEFORE.
HE CREATED THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
HE ESTABLISHED THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
AND THE C.I.A., THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,
PUTTING THE UNITED STATES IN THE BUSINESS OF PEACETIME SPYING
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY.
SOON THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER FIRST:
NATO, AMERICA'S FIRST PEACETIME ALLIANCE,
A BULWARK SET IN WESTERN EUROPE AGAINST COMMUNISM.
TRUMAN WAS CHANGING THE WAY AMERICANS LOOKED AT THE WORLD
AND AT THEMSELVES.
LaFeber:
I THINK TRUMAN'S GREAT CONTRIBUTION
TO AMERICAN POLITICS
WAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET AMERICANS TO COMMIT THEMSELVES
TO A WAR WHICH WAS COLD RATHER THAN HOT,
A WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN DECLARED,
A WAR WHICH IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX
AND YET WHICH TRUMAN DEFINED AS A RATHER SIMPLE WAR
BETWEEN THE ENSLAVED AND THE FREE PEOPLES.
THIS IS HOW HE GOT AMERICANS TO COMMIT THEMSELVES
TO THE COLD WAR, IN WHICH RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN SOLDIERS
WERE BEGINNING TO PEER ACROSS BOUNDARIES AT EACH OTHER.
Narrator:
THE COLD WAR HAD BEGUN,
AND IT WOULD LAST FOR THE NEXT HALF CENTURY.
Narrator:
AFTER THREE YEARS IN OFFICE, TRUMAN WAS AT LAST ENJOYING
BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
DOZENS OF NEWSPAPERS DESCRIBED THE "NEW" HARRY TRUMAN... (applause)
CALM...
FORCEFUL...
RADIATING AUTHORITY.
McCullough:
HE HAD DECIDED THAT HE REALLY LIKED THE JOB
AND THAT HE WAS PRETTY GOOD AT IT.
AND HE TOOK THE PRESIDENCY VERY SERIOUSLY,
BUT HE DIDN'T TAKE HARRY TRUMAN ALL THAT SERIOUSLY ALL THE TIME.
AND SOMETIMES HE DIDN'T SEEM VERY PRESIDENTIAL,
AND OF COURSE HIS OPPONENTS SAW THOSE
AS WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO BELITTLE HIM.
Narrator:
REPORTERS MADE FUN OF HIS SHIRTS AND HIS POKER GAMES,
CRITICIZED HIS CRONIES AND HIS FONDNESS FOR GOOD BOURBON.
BUT TRUMAN ALWAYS REMAINED HIMSELF.
Shulman:
HE NEVER MADE ANY EFFORT
TO CREATE A PUBLIC-RELATIONS IMAGE.
HE WAS WHAT HE WAS AND HE NEVER PRETENDED OTHERWISE.
AND IT WAS EARTHY,
IT WAS, UH...
IT CAME OUT OF THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA
WITH ALL ITS VIRTUES AND ITS LIMITATIONS, TOO.
HE ALWAYS SAID HE WAS A FARMER FROM MISSOURI
TRYING TO DO HIS DAMNEDEST.
I THINK HE GAVE EVERYONE THE IMPRESSION
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR POSITION WAS
THAT YOU WERE AN IMPORTANT PART
OF WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE.
I REMEMBER THE VERY FIRST TIME
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
INVITED ME, AS A JUNIOR STAFF MEMBER, TO COME TO DINNER.
(piano playing)
PRESIDENT TRUMAN SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO.
I BEGAN TO SOAR INTO THE CLOUDS.
AND AFTERWARD, HE TURNED FROM THE PIANO
AND LOOKED AT ME AND SORT OF SMILED AND SAID,
"YOU KNOW," HE SAID, "IF I HADN'T GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE
"BY GETTING INTO POLITICS,
"I WOULD HAVE MADE A HELL OF A GOOD PIANO PLAYER
IN A WHOREHOUSE."
AND THIS...
THIS WAS...
OF COURSE, BROUGHT ME DOWN TO EARTH.
HE TENDED TO LOOK DOWN ON HIMSELF AS A PERSON,
YET HE REVERED THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE.
Shulman:
AND ONE TIME, IN A MOOD OF REFLECTION,
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT REALLY IS TWO PEOPLE,
AND ONE OF THEM IS THE PRESIDENT."
AND THEN HE SORT OF STRAIGHTENED IN HIS CHAIR
AND YOU COULD FEEL THE SENSE OF OBLIGATION THAT HE HAD,
WHICH LIFTED HIM, AND HIS...
HIS DIGNITY
AND HIS SENSE OF PRINCIPLED COMMITMENT.
AND THEN HE SORT OF SLUMPED A LITTLE BIT AND SAID,
"AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE PRESIDENT AS A HUMAN BEING
AND THE WEAR AND TEAR THAT GOES WITH THE JOB."
Narrator:
TRUMAN HAD SAID MANY TIMES
HE NEVER WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT.
NOW HE HAD CHANGED HIS MIND--
HE WANTED THE JOB FOR FOUR MORE YEARS.
HE HAD FAILED HIS PARTY IN 1946.
HE WANTED TO REDEEM HIMSELF IN 1948.
BUT HE WAS ABOUT TO RISK FRACTURING THE DEMOCRATS
BY REACHING OUT TO AMERICANS WHO BY TRADITION AND CULTURE
HE HAD DISMISSED NEARLY ALL HIS LIFE.
IN THE SOUTH, SEGREGATION RULED BY LAW AND CUSTOM
AS IT HAD FOR GENERATIONS.
ALL ACROSS AMERICA, AFRICAN AMERICANS CONFRONTED POVERTY,
PREJUDICE, LIMITED OPPORTUNITY.
AND BLACK SAILORS AND SOLDIERS
WHO HAD FOUGHT OVERSEAS FOR AMERICA'S FREEDOM
DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY FOUND WHEN THEY RETURNED HOME.
Man:
HERE WE ARE AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II.
WE HAD DEFEATED ONE OF THE GREAT RACISTS IN HUMAN HISTORY--
HITLER, AND OF COURSE MUSSOLINI AND JAPAN--
BUT THE WHOLE CLIMATE SAID, "WE ARE GOING TO REMAIN THE SAME,
"EVEN THOUGH THE WAR AIMS WE HAD
"WERE LOFTY AND IDEALISTIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND...
"AND PRESAGED A NEW WORLD, AND SO FORTH,
BUT YOU ARE STILL A NIGGER."
THE UNITED STATES WAS ADVERTISED AS THE ARSENAL FOR DEMOCRACY,
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE RACE QUESTION,
THINGS HAVE GOT TO REMAIN THE SAME.
Narrator:
IN 1946, A HORRIBLE SERIES
OF RACIAL MURDERS IN THE SOUTH SHOCKED AMERICA.
TRUMAN WAS OUTRAGED.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS CLAMORED FOR ANTI-LYNCHING LAWS,
BUT DIDN'T EXPECT MUCH FROM THE PRESIDENT FROM MISSOURI.
Hamby:
IT SEEMS A PRETTY SURE BET
THAT PRIVATELY HE BELIEVED
THAT MOST BLACKS WERE INFERIOR TO MOST WHITES,
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY
THAT NEITHER HE NOR BESS WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED
IF MARGARET HAD BROUGHT SIDNEY POITIER HOME FOR DINNER.
BUT HE ALSO CAME FROM A BACKGROUND
THAT SAID EVERYONE DESERVED AN EQUAL CHANCE IN LIFE.
Narrator:
ON JUNE 28, 1947,
TRUMAN WROTE HIS SISTER A LETTER.
"I'VE GOT TO MAKE A SPEECH TOMORROW
"TO THE SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE
"AND I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE IT.
MAMA WON'T LIKE WHAT I SAY."
THERE IS NO JUSTIFIABLE REASON FOR DISCRIMINATION
BECAUSE OF ANCESTRY OR RELIGION OR RACE OR COLOR.
(applause)
Narrator:
NO PRESIDENT HAD EVER BEFORE ADDRESSED
THE NEARLY 40-YEAR-OLD N.A.A.C.P.
TRUMAN BECAME THE FIRST, AS HE SPOKE TO A RALLY OF THOUSANDS
AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.
A SOUTHERNER BY BIRTH AND INCLINATION,
HE ARGUED FOR EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS.
WE CANNOT ANY LONGER AWAIT THE GROWTH OF A WILL TO ACTION
IN THE SLOWEST STATE OR THE MOST BACKWARD COMMUNITY.
(applause)
OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MUST SHOW THE WAY.
(applause)
Woman:
WELL, I THINK EVERYBODY WAS THRILLED,
AND I THINK THE APPEARANCE THAT HE HAD WITH THE N.A.A.C.P.
RESOUNDED ALL OVER.
TRUMAN PROVED TO BE QUITE A SURPRISE.
HE WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAD THOUGHT OF
IN TERMS OF A PERSON OF HIS BACKGROUND.
Narrator:
BUT TRUMAN HESITATED
TO PUT CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION BEFORE CONGRESS.
HE FEARED THAT IF HE ACTED TO HELP AFRICAN AMERICANS,
HE WOULD LOSE THE SUPPORT OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS.
Hamby:
THERE'S A GREAT CONFLICT HERE,
AND POLITICALLY, TRUMAN HAS TO CHOOSE:
IS HE GOING TO GO WITH THE SOUTH
OR IS HE GOING TO GO WITH, UH...
THE NORTHERN LIBERALS,
AND THE, UH, BLACK CONSTITUENCY
AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRAM THEY FAVOR?
Narrator:
ON FEBRUARY 2, 1948,
TRUMAN BECAME THE FIRST PRESIDENT
TO SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON CIVIL RIGHTS.
HE CALLED FOR ANTI-LYNCHING LAWS, ABOLITION OF THE POLL TAX,
ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS,
DESEGREGATION OF THE ARMED FORCES.
Jarrett:
IT WAS A GREAT MESSAGE.
YOU HADN'T HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE!
PRIOR TO THAT, WE COULDN'T EVEN GET A PRESIDENT
TO MAKE AN ORATORICAL STATEMENT.
HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE CHANCES OF MUCH LEGISLATION...
ANY LEGISLATION, GETTING THROUGH THAT CONGRESS
WAS PRACTICALLY NIL.
THE POINT WAS, YOU HAD TO START SOMETIME
AND HE WAS GOING TO START.
Narrator:
SOUTHERN NEWSPAPERS
CALLED TRUMAN'S CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION
A "DISMAYING DOCUMENT" BASED ON A "PERNICIOUS FALLACY."
"HERE WE HAVE THE MAKING OF A VERITABLE GESTAPO."
Man:
MOST OF THE SOUTHERN SENATORS FELT IT WENT TOO FAR.
SENATOR BYRD, SR., WAS IN THE SENATE AT THAT TIME AND HE FELT
THAT SOME OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION WENT TOO FAR,
AND HE OPPOSED IT.
EQUAL THIS, EQUAL THAT-- THE WHOLE THING JUST REEKED
IN TERMS OF HOW THE SOUTHERNERS LOOKED AT IT
WITH CONCESSIONS TO NIGGERS.
LET'S PUT IT THE WAY...
THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID.
I RECALL MRS. LEONARD THOMAS,
ONE OF THE ALABAMA NATIONAL COMMITTEEMEN,
CAME TO TRUMAN AND SAID TO HIM,
"PLEASE DON'T FORCE MISCEGENATION ON THE SOUTH.
"PLEASE TELL THE SOUTH THAT YOU REALLY DON'T BELIEVE
"AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK WHAT YOU'VE SAID
ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS."
AND TRUMAN LOOKED AT HER
AND PULLED OUT A COPY OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS
AND SAID, "I'M THE PRESIDENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE.
"I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE BACK A WORD OF WHAT I SAID."
Narrator:
THE BATTLE OVER CIVIL RIGHTS WAS A POLITICAL DISASTER.
A GALLUP POLL SHOWED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS
OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT'S STAND.
CIVIL RIGHTS WAS HURTING
TRUMAN'S CHANCES FOR REELECTION.
McCullough:
AT THE SAME TIME AS HIS CIVIL RIGHTS MESSAGE
WAS SPLITTING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
THE ISSUE OF WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN IN PALESTINE COMES TO THE FORE.
Narrator:
SINCE THE END OF THE 19th CENTURY,
THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAD ASPIRED
TO ESTABLISH A HOMELAND IN PALESTINE.
NOW, AFTER THE DEVASTATION OF THE HOLOCAUST,
JEWS FIERCELY LOBBIED TRUMAN
TO RECOGNIZE A NEW JEWISH STATE THERE,
EVEN ENLISTING EDDIE JACOBSON,
HIS OLD PARTNER IN THE HABERDASHERY,
TO WIN TRUMAN TO THEIR CAUSE.
BUT SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE MARSHALL FEARED
THAT ARABS, CLAIMING PALESTINE AS THEIR OWN,
WOULD CUT OFF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY OF OIL
AND THROW THE MIDDLE EAST INTO TURMOIL.
McCullough:
MARSHALL WAS THE AMERICAN
THAT HARRY TRUMAN ADMIRED MORE THAN ANY OTHER.
NOW, FOR TRUMAN TO GO AGAINST GEORGE MARSHALL
WAS FOR HIM ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MOMENTS
IN HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY.
Narrator:
FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE ADVICE OF GEORGE MARSHALL
AND HIS SYMPATHIES FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE,
TRUMAN, ON MAY 14, 1948, GAVE DE FACTO RECOGNITION TO ISRAEL.
HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT
AND AT THE SAME TIME WON THE VOTES OF JEWISH CITIZENS.
IN 1948, TRUMAN WOULD NEED ALL THE VOTES HE COULD GET.
IN SPITE OF HIS TRIUMPHS OVERSEAS,
MANY AMERICANS STILL QUESTIONED HIS EFFECTIVENESS AT HOME.
(crowd cheering, band playing "Columbia, Gem of the Ocean")
Narrator:
ON JUNE 21, THE REPUBLICANS CONVENED IN PHILADELPHIA.
AFTER THREE DAYS OF CELEBRATING FREE ENTERPRISE
AND DENOUNCING HARRY TRUMAN, THEY NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT
THE URBANE, PROGRESSIVE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, THOMAS DEWEY.
I PRAY GOD THAT I MAY DESERVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY.
IN ALL HUMILITY, I ACCEPT THE NOMINATION.
(cheering and applause)
Narrator:
FOUR YEARS EARLIER,
DEWEY HAD RUN A STRONG RACE
AGAINST THE UNDEFEATABLE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT.
THIS TIME AROUND, REPUBLICANS GIDDILY ANTICIPATED VICTORY
AGAINST ROOSEVELT'S STAND-IN...
HARRY TRUMAN.
Hamby:
HE STILL APPEARED TO A LOT OF AMERICANS
TO BE A LITTLE GUY, AN ORDINARY MAN, SOMEONE WHO UTTERLY LACKED
THE CHARISMA OF HIS PREDECESSOR, ROOSEVELT.
AMERICANS STILL REALLY WONDERED
WHETHER SOMEONE WHO APPEARED TO BE SO MUCH LIKE THEMSELVES
COULD REALLY HANDLE THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
OF THE PRESIDENCY.
Narrator:
IN JULY, THE DEMOCRATS GATHERED
IN THE SAME PHILADELPHIA HALL WHERE TWO WEEKS EARLIER
THE REPUBLICANS HAD GIVEN THEIR NOMINATION TO THOMAS DEWEY.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, TELEVISION WAS THERE TO REPORT THE STORY.
...to the people's interests, a way in which rescued the American economy of free enterprise...
Narrator:
TRUMAN WATCHED FROM THE OVAL OFFICE
WHAT NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE WOULD CALL
"THE WORST-MANAGED, MOST DISPIRITED CONVENTION
IN AMERICAN HISTORY."
Donovan:
THERE WAS NO AIR CONDITIONING,
AND IT WAS, FROM THE BEGINNING, A SWELTERING CONVENTION
IN THE HOTEL ROOMS AS WELL AS IN THE HALL.
IT WAS A DISMAL CONVENTION FROM THE START BECAUSE THE CONVENTION
THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO NOMINATE A LOSER.
NO ONE IN THAT CONVENTION HALL THOUGHT TRUMAN COULD WIN.
Narrator:
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS SPLITTING APART,
AND NO ONE THOUGHT HARRY TRUMAN COULD HOLD IT TOGETHER.
LEFT-LEANING DEMOCRATS HAD ALREADY TURNED
TO THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY AND THEIR CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT,
HENRY WALLACE.
(cheering)
CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS,
FURIOUS OVER TRUMAN'S STAND ON CIVIL RIGHTS,
WERE THREATENING TO WALK OUT OF THE CONVENTION.
THE DELEGATION FROM MISSISSIPPI
COULD NOT BE TRUE TO THE PEOPLE OF THAT GREAT STATE
IF THEY DID NOT JOIN IN THIS WALKOUT.
Narrator:
IN THE END, THREE DOZEN SOUTHERN DELEGATES BOLTED.
AND WE BID YOU GOOD-BYE.
Narrator:
TWO DAYS LATER,
THEY FORMED THEIR OWN PARTY, THE "DIXIECRATS."
McCullough:
AND IT SEEMED ANOTHER DEVASTATING BLOW
TO TRUMAN'S PROSPECTS.
THE COMBINATION OF THE SOUTHERNERS WALKING OUT
AND HENRY WALLACE LEADING HIS OWN PROGRESSIVE PARTY CAMPAIGN,
PLUS ALL THE GLOOM AND DOOM THAT SEEMED TO PREVAIL
THROUGHOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
SPELLED ONLY DEFEAT, SPELLED A VERY BLEAK FUTURE.
Narrator:
BUT AS HARRY TRUMAN ARRIVED IN PHILADELPHIA,
HE WAS ANYTHING BUT BLEAK.
IN A SMALL, WINDOWLESS ROOM BENEATH THE CONVENTION FLOOR,
HE SAT WITH VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE ALBEN BARKLEY
AND WAITED.
McCullough:
THEY KEPT HIM WAITING TILL ALMOST 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
EVERYBODY WAS EXHAUSTED.
THEY FELT DEMORALIZED, THEY DIDN'T, MANY OF THEM,
WANT HARRY TRUMAN TO BE THEIR CANDIDATE,
THE SOUTHERNERS HAD WALKED OUT OF THE CONVENTION.
AND SO AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING,
OUT CAME HARRY TRUMAN IN HIS WHITE LINEN SUIT
AND HE STOOD UP THERE, AND HE SAID...
SENATOR BARKLEY AND I WILL WIN THIS ELECTION
AND MAKE THESE REPUBLICANS LIKE IT.
DON'T YOU FORGET THAT.
(cheering)
Hamby:
HE'S A FIGHTER.
TRUMAN IS NOT ABOUT TO SLINK OUT OF TOWN
WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS.
THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM CRIES ABOUT CRUELLY HIGH PRICES...
Narrator:
TRUMAN HAD COME INTO THE PRESIDENCY
BEWILDERED AND FRIGHTENED;
NOW THE DELEGATES SAT STUNNED
AS A FIRE-BREATHING TRUMAN TORE INTO THE REPUBLICANS.
THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM COMES OUT FOR SLUM CLEARANCE
AND LOW-RENTAL HOUSING.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THEM TO PASS THAT HOUSING BILL
EVER SINCE THEY MET THE FIRST TIME.
Narrator:
TRUMAN CHALLENGED THE REPUBLICANS
TO LIVE UP TO THEIR PROMISES.
I AM THEREFORE CALLING THIS CONGRESS BACK INTO SESSION
ON THE 26th OF JULY!
(wild cheering)
IF THERE'S ANY REALITY BEHIND THAT REPUBLICAN PLATFORM,
WE OUGHT TO GET SOME ACTION
OUT OF THE SHORT SESSION OF THE 80th CONGRESS.
THEY CAN DO THIS JOB IN 15 DAYS IF THEY WANT TO DO IT,
AND THEY'LL STILL HAVE TIME TO GO OUT AND RUN FOR OFFICE.
Narrator:
TRUMAN HAD COME OUT FIGHTING,
BUT STILL, NO ONE THOUGHT HE COULD WIN.
ALL THE POLLS MADE HIM A SURE LOSER.
McCullough:
EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE.
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH.
EVEN MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FAMILY-- HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS QUITE SURE
THAT HARRY TRUMAN WAS GOING TO LOSE.
Narrator:
TRUMAN'S REPUBLICAN OPPONENT WAS EVERYTHING TRUMAN WAS NOT.
EDUCATED, SMOOTH, SOPHISTICATED, TOM DEWEY WAS PREPARED, HE SAID,
TO TURN BACK 16 YEARS OF DEMOCRATIC RULE.
I PLEDGE TO YOU THAT ON NEXT JANUARY 20,
THERE WILL BEGIN IN WASHINGTON
THE BIGGEST UNRAVELING, UNSNARLING, UNTANGLING OPERATION
IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.
(cheering and applause)
Donovan:
FROM THE BEGINNING, DEWEY WAS TRANSFIXED BY POLLS
AND BY TIME MAGAZINE AND EVERYONE ELSE
WHO WAS BOOSTING HIM FOR PRESIDENT.
HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF,
VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT HE'D DONE,
VERY SURE THAT HE WAS GOING TO GO ON AND BE A GREAT FIGURE.
THEY WERE SO CONFIDENT
THAT SOME OF THE DEWEY PEOPLE HAD ALREADY BOUGHT HOUSES
IN WASHINGTON.
Narrator:
ON SEPTEMBER 17, TRUMAN SET OUT ON WHAT WOULD BECOME
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS CAMPAIGNS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Donovan:
HE WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE TO EVERYBODY AND SO FORTH,
AND ALBEN BARKLEY, A VERY GOOD-HEARTED MAN,
CAME UP AND SAID, "GIVE 'EM HELL, HARRY!"
AND TRUMAN SAID SOMETHING--
"I'LL GIVE 'EM HELL, I'LL GIVE 'EM HELL, ALBEN."
WE HAD NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT.
THE TRAIN'S STARTING OUT ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
SO EVERYONE'S WRITING ABOUT "GIVE 'EM HELL."
Narrator:
FROM THEN ON, "GIVE 'EM HELL, HARRY"
WOULD BECOME HARRY TRUMAN'S BATTLE CRY.
(train whistle blaring)
DURING THE NEXT SIX WEEKS,
TRUMAN WOULD TRAVEL 22,000 MILES,
CRISSCROSSING THE COUNTRY THREE TIMES.
THE ISSUES, HE SAID, WERE SIMPLE--
THE REPUBLICANS WANTED TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK,
DESTROY FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL.
TRUMAN WAS GOING TO STOP THEM.
Truman:
IF YOU GIVE THE REPUBLICANS
COMPLETE CONTROL OF THIS GOVERNMENT,
YOU MIGHT JUST AS WELL TURN IT OVER TO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS,
AND WE'LL START ON A BOOM-AND-BUST CYCLE
AND TRY TO GO THROUGH JUST WHAT WE DID IN THE '20s
AND END UP WITH A CRASH, WHICH IN THE LONG RUN
WILL DO NOBODY ANY GOOD BUT THE COMMUNISTS.
Narrator:
TRUMAN KEPT UP A GRUELING PACE,
GIVING NO QUARTER TO HIS OPPONENTS.
WHEN THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY CANDIDATE, HENRY WALLACE,
ARGUED FOR COOPERATION WITH THE SOVIET UNION,
TRUMAN ATTACKED WALLACE AS A COMMUNIST PAWN.
WHEN THE SEGREGATIONIST DIXIECRAT PARTY
NOMINATED STROM THURMOND, TRUMAN DESEGREGATED THE ARMED FORCES,
WINNING THE VOTES OF BLACK AMERICANS
AND CHANGING THE AMERICAN MILITARY FOREVER.
Jarrett:
THE ARMED FORCES--
THE SEAT OF SEGREGATION, THE SEAT OF RACISM--
AND TO HAVE HIM ISSUE THAT ORDER, FOR WHATEVER REASON,
WAS A GREAT LEAP FORWARD IN HISTORY.
Women:
♫ALL WE DO IS GO OUT WALKING♫
♫WHERE THE SUN SHINES BRIGHT AND GAY♫
♫BUT WHAT DO WE DO, WHAT DO WE DO ON A DEW-DEW-DEWEY DAY?
♫
Narrator:
CAMPAIGNING AS IF HE HAD ALREADY WON,
TOM DEWEY TOOK NO RISKS, OFFERED NO SURPRISES.
McCullough:
HIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN WAS BEING RUN
ACCORDING TO WHAT THE POLLS WERE TELLING HIM TO DO:
DON'T ROCK THE BOAT;
DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO ANTAGONIZE ANYONE;
DON'T SAY ANYTHING CONTROVERSIAL;
JUST BE CALM, SMOOTH, SPEAK IN PLATITUDES.
WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY, LOYALTY, FAIR PLAY,
CONCERN FOR OUR NEIGHBORS,
THE INNATE ABILITY OF MEN TO ACHIEVE.
THESE CONVICTIONS, ARCHED OVER BY OUR FAITH IN GOD,
ARE THE INNER MEANING OF THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE.
Donovan:
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH EMPATHY,
IF THAT'S THE WORD.
YOU WOULDN'T CUDDLE UP TO TOM DEWEY.
McCullough:
THE DEWEY CAMPAIGN WAS VERY EFFICIENT;
IT WAS VERY CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED.
THE OFFICIAL DRINK ONBOARD THE DEWEY TRAIN WAS THE MARTINI;
THE CARD GAME WAS BRIDGE.
ON THE TRUMAN TRAIN, THINGS WERE QUITE DIFFERENT.
THE DRINK OF THE HOUR WAS NEARLY ALWAYS BOURBON
AND THE CARD GAME WAS POKER.
TRUMAN KEPT THAT TRAIN REALLY MOVING.
AND HE TRAVELED AND TRAVELED AND TRAVELED,
BUT HE SEEMED TO DRAW ENERGY FROM IT.
HE LOVED IT.
AND AS HE PROGRESSED, HE GOT BETTER.
AND THE MORE HE TRAVELED, THE MORE THE CROWDS TURNED OUT
AND THE LARGER THE CROWDS WERE.
Woman:
EVERY TOWN WE PULLED INTO HAD A HIGH SCHOOL BAND
THAT PLAYED "THE MISSOURI WALTZ"
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT SPOKE.
AND EVERYBODY GOT SO SICK OF IT.
ALWAYS THERE WAS "THE MISSOURI WALTZ."
(humming tune)
AND TRUMAN, I'M TOLD, HATED "THE MISSOURI WALTZ"
AND EVERYWHERE HE HAD "THE MISSOURI WALTZ"!
Reuther:
HARRY WAS A DAMNED GOOD CAMPAIGNER.
HE LOVED TO GET OUT AND MIX WITH PEOPLE
AND HE KNEW HOW TO TALK THEIR LANGUAGE.
YOU KNOW, HE WAS NO HIGHFALUTIN GUY.
HE COULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY FACTORY WORKER,
EVERY COAL MINER, EVERY TEXTILE WORKER, EVERY HOUSEWIFE.
Truman:
I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS A LONG TIME,
AND IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU
IF IT ISN'T SO.
IF THEY CAN PROVE IT ON YOU, YOU'RE IN A BAD FIX INDEED.
(crowd laughs)
Donovan:
HE UNDERSTOOD PEOPLE.
HE ESPECIALLY UNDERSTOOD PEOPLE OF HIS AREA--
THE MIDWEST, THE FARMERS.
VOTE FOR YOUR FARMS.
VOTE FOR THE STANDARD OF LIVING THAT YOU'VE WON
UNDER A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION.
GET OUT THERE ON ELECTION DAY AND VOTE FOR YOUR FUTURE.
(cheering)
YOU KNOW, I COVERED EVERY INCH
OF THE TRUMAN WHISTLE-STOP CAMPAIGN.
I WAS IN EVERY FARMYARD AND MAIN STREET AND THE REST OF IT.
AND I'D SEE THESE BIG CROWDS
AND I'D THINK, "WELL, DEWEY HAS BIGGER CROWDS."
WHATEVER I FELT, I THOUGHT DEWEY WAS GOING TO WIN.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WHO THOUGHT OTHERWISE-
- ANYBODY.
Narrator:
AS THE CAMPAIGN DREW TO A CLOSE, THE NEW YORK TIMES
WAS PREDICTING DEWEY WOULD RUN AWAY WITH THE ELECTION.
THE GALLUP POLL WAS SO CERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME,
IT STOPPED POLLING BEFORE THE END OF OCTOBER.
McCullough:
THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION,
THE HEAD OF THE SECRET SERVICE WENT TO NEW YORK
TO BE WITH MR. DEWEY
BECAUSE HE CLEARLY WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT.
AND IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A SURE THING.
AND THE ONLY ONE WHO DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A SURE THING
WAS HARRY TRUMAN.
Narrator:
ONE EVENING, THREE OR FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION,
AN ANXIOUS BESS TRUMAN WENT QUIETLY
TO SEE HER HUSBAND'S AIDE, CLARK CLIFFORD.
Clifford:
AND SHE SAID, "CLARK, DO YOU THINK
HARRY REALLY BELIEVES THAT HE CAN WIN?"
AND I SAID, "HE GIVES EVERY ASSURANCE OF IT, MRS. TRUMAN."
SHE SAYS, "WELL, HE KEEPS SAYING HE'S GOING TO WIN."
"WELL," I SAID, "THAT'S THE WAY HE FEELS."
AND I SAID, "HE'S GOING TO FEEL THAT WAY RIGHT UP TO THE END."
"BUT," SHE SAID, "IT'S SO HARD
TO FIND ANYBODY ELSE WHO THINKS THAT HE CAN WIN."
I THINK SHE FELT THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ANY CHANCE OF WINNING.
Narrator:
ON ELECTION NIGHT, TO ESCAPE REPORTERS,
TRUMAN CHECKED INTO A HOTEL IN EXCELSIOR SPRINGS,
JUST OUTSIDE OF INDEPENDENCE.
HE HAD A HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH, A GLASS OF BUTTERMILK
AND WENT TO SLEEP.
(rooster crows)
Narrator:
WHEN HE WOKE UP,
HE LEARNED HE HAD PULLED OFF THE GREATEST UPSET
IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS.
NOT ONE POLLSTER OR RADIO COMMENTATOR
OR NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST HAD GOT IT RIGHT.
NO ONE HAD DARED PREDICT A TRUMAN VICTORY.
(crowd cheering)
Dewey:
I'VE SENT THE FOLLOWING WIRE TO PRESIDENT TRUMAN:
"MY HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ON YOUR ELECTION
"AND EVERY GOOD WISH FOR A SUCCESSFUL ADMINISTRATION.
"I URGE ALL AMERICANS TO UNITE BEHIND YOU
IN SUPPORT OF EVERY EFFORT TO..."
(crowd cheering)
Reuther:
TRUMAN CAME THROUGH AS A FEISTY FIGHTER,
AND WE LOVED THAT, YOU KNOW.
THE LABOR MOVEMENT CAME AROUND TO ADMIRE TRUMAN.
WE KNEW THAT ON BASIC ISSUES HE WOULD STAND WITH THE PEOPLE,
INCLUDING WORKING PEOPLE AGAINST SPECIAL INTERESTS,
AND THAT HE WAS CONCERNED
AND DETERMINED TO HELP CARRY THROUGH THE LEGACY OF F.D.R.
McCullough:
WE'LL NEVER KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM
BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THEY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE,
THEY LIKED HIM.
CERTAINLY, A VERY GREAT MANY PEOPLE SAID LATER,
"I VOTED FOR HARRY TRUMAN
"EVEN THOUGH I WAS SURE HE WAS GOING TO LOSE
BECAUSE I LIKED HIM."
IT WAS THE HIGH POINT OF HIS POLITICAL LIFE.
HE HAD MADE ALL THE SMARTIES LOOK FOOLISH.
I AM MOST HAPPY...
MOST HAPPY TO HAVE TOGETHER ALL THE SEPTEMBER DEMOCRATS
AND THE OCTOBER DEMOCRATS... (loud laughter)
AND THE MONDAY DEMOCRATS AND THE TUESDAY DEMOCRATS
AND THE WEDNESDAY DEMOCRATS.
(laughter and cheering)
Donovan:
HE GOT A TREMENDOUS WELCOME
WHEN HE CAME BACK TO WASHINGTON, JUST TREMENDOUS--
ONE OF THE BIGGEST TURNOUTS THE TOWN HAD SEEN.
HE JUST GLOWED WITH IT.
BUT, BOY, HE CAME BACK TO A TOUGH SECOND TERM,
JUST A TOUGH SECOND TERM.
Narrator:
64 YEARS OLD,
TRUMAN HAD REDEEMED HIMSELF AND HIS PARTY,
BUT IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
HE WOULD NEED ALL HIS MISSOURI OPTIMISM
TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES HE WOULD MEET ABROAD
AND THE FRUSTRATIONS HE WOULD SUFFER AT HOME.
Truman:
EVERY SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION
AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAVE A RIGHT
TO EXPECT FROM OUR GOVERNMENT A FAIR DEAL.
Narrator:
AT HOME, TRUMAN ONCE AGAIN EVOKED THE SPIRIT
OF FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, AND ASKED CONGRESS TO SUPPORT
WHAT HE NOW CALLED THE "FAIR DEAL"--
A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE, CIVIL RIGHTS, AID TO EDUCATION,
HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL AMERICANS.
CONGRESS REFUSED.
ONE CRITIC CALLED IT "THE SAME OLD DOG WITH A NEW NAME."
(warning siren blows)
OVERSEAS, TRUMAN WAS FACING A NEW THREAT
FROM THE SOVIET UNION.
IN REACTION TO AMERICA'S EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN WEST GERMANY,
THE RUSSIANS HAD BLOCKADED WESTERN-CONTROLLED BERLIN,
CUTTING ALL RAIL, HIGHWAY AND WATER TRAFFIC
IN AND OUT OF THE CITY.
2 1/2 MILLION BERLINERS HAD ONLY ENOUGH FOOD TO LAST A MONTH.
BUT TRUMAN WOULD FORCE THE COMMUNISTS TO BACK DOWN.
IN A DARING MOVE, TRUMAN ORDERED A FULL-SCALE AIRLIFT
TO FLY FOOD AND SUPPLIES FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
TO THE BELEAGUERED BERLINERS.
TRUMAN HAD ONCE AGAIN CONFRONTED THE SOVIET UNION
WITH A SHOW OF STRENGTH.
BUT HIS EFFORTS TO STAND FIRM WERE CHALLENGED BY TWO BLOWS
THAT CAME IN SWIFT SUCCESSION.
LaFeber:
IN LATE AUGUST OF 1949,
TRUMAN LEARNED FROM AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE
THAT THE SOVIETS HAD EXPLODED AN ATOMIC DEVICE.
AND THIS SHOCKED TRUMAN.
Narrator:
AMERICA'S MONOPOLY ON THE ATOMIC BOMB HAD ENDED.
JUST WEEKS LATER,
CHINA, THE MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,
FELL TO MAO ZEDONG'S COMMUNISTS.
McCullough:
IN CONGRESS AND IN THE COUNTRY, THERE WAS A FEELING
THAT SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG IN WASHINGTON,
SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG IN THE GOVERNMENT,
AND OUT OF THIS FEAR AND THIS UNCERTAINTY
AROSE THE VOICE OF SENATOR JOE McCARTHY,
WHO BEGAN TO RANT AND RAVE
ABOUT COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY AND HIGH TREASON IN HIGH PLACES.
Narrator:
AS AMERICANS GREW INCREASINGLY FRIGHTENED
BY A WORLD THAT SEEMED TO BE SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL,
THE PRESSURE ON TRUMAN MOUNTED TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON DEFENSE.
EARLY IN 1950, THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TRIED
TO CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT TO QUADRUPLE MILITARY SPENDING,
BUT TRUMAN TURNED THEIR REQUEST ASIDE.
HE BELIEVED THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT COMMUNISM WAS
BY BUILDING A STRONG AMERICA
AND TO TRUMAN, THAT BEGAN WITH A BALANCED BUDGET.
LaFeber:
THERE'S A STORY
THAT HARRY TRUMAN MADE HIS DEFENSE BUDGET
SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS:
HE WOULD TAKE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
COMING INTO THE GOVERNMENT EVERY YEAR,
PUT IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER, SUBTRACT FROM THAT FIGURE
WHATEVER WAS NEEDED FOR EDUCATION,
RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT, SO ON.
WHATEVER WAS LEFT WAS THE DEFENSE BUDGET FOR THAT YEAR.
Narrator:
BUT THEN, IN EARLY SUMMER, EVERYTHING CHANGED.
HARRY TRUMAN WAS ABOUT TO CONFRONT THE COMMUNISTS
ONE MORE TIME, AND HE WOULD NEED ALL HIS STAMINA AND GRIT
TO KEEP FROM GOING UNDER.
SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1950 WAS A BAKING HOT SUMMER DAY
IN INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI.
TRUMAN WAS HOME SPENDING THE WEEKEND WITH HIS FAMILY
IN THE HOUSE WHERE HE AND BESS HAD LIVED WITH BESS'S MOTHER
EVER SINCE THEY WERE MARRIED 30 YEARS BEFORE.
AT 9:00, HE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL
FROM SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN ACHESON.
"MR. PRESIDENT," ACHESON SAID, "I HAVE VERY SERIOUS NEWS.
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE INVADED SOUTH KOREA."
Narrator:
SUPPORTED BY TANKS AND ARTILLERY,
SEVEN NORTH KOREAN INFANTRY DIVISIONS--
SOME 90,000 MEN-- HAD LAUNCHED A SURPRISE ATTACK.
THE CRISIS THAT WOULD HAUNT TRUMAN
FOR THE REST OF HIS YEARS IN OFFICE HAD BEGUN.
NOT LONG AFTER TRUMAN HAD BECOME PRESIDENT,
KOREA WAS DIVIDED AT THE 38th PARALLEL
INTO TWO HOSTILE PARTS--
A SOVIET-SUPPORTED NORTH AND AN AMERICAN-BACKED SOUTH.
NOW THE NORTH HAD ATTACKED THE SOUTH, WITH JUST ONE GOAL:
TO UNIFY KOREA UNDER COMMUNIST RULE.
Elsey:
HE WAS CONVINCED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
THAT THE SOVIETS WERE BEHIND THIS.
HE HAD NO DOUBTS AT ALL OF THAT.
WE'D SEEN IT AS THEY'D TAKEN OVER THE SATELLITE COUNTRIES
IN EASTERN EUROPE,
AS THEY HAD POKED AND PRODDED AND PRESSED ELSEWHERE.
LaFeber:
HIS INITIAL RESPONSE WAS
THAT THIS WAS A SOVIET-DIRECTED ATTACK
AND THAT HE WAS BEING DIRECTLY CHALLENGED BY STALIN.
STALIN DID SUPPORT THE INVASION, BUT AT NORTH KOREA'S INSISTENCE,
AND IT WAS FROM A SAFE DISTANCE
BY SENDING SOVIET SUPPLIES AND ADVISERS.
WHAT THE UNITED STATES GOT INVOLVED WITH IN 1950
WAS NOT AGGRESSION FROM THE SOVIET UNION.
WHAT WE GOT INVOLVED WITH WAS
AN INCREDIBLY BLOODY CIVIL WAR IN KOREA.
THERE WERE AS MANY AS 100,000 KOREANS KILLED
BEFORE THE KOREAN WAR OF 1950 OCCURRED,
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT TRUMAN KNEW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT THIS BACKGROUND.
Narrator:
AS TRUMAN HEADED BACK TO WASHINGTON,
HE TURNED TO THE WAR THAT HAD ENDED JUST FIVE YEARS BEFORE
TO HELP HIM UNDERSTAND THE WAR HE WAS FACING NOW.
"COMMUNISM WAS ACTING IN KOREA," HE WROTE,
"JUST AS HITLER AND THE JAPANESE HAD ACTED EARLIER.
"IF THE COMMUNISTS WERE PERMITTED TO FORCE THEIR WAY
"INTO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA,
"NO SMALL NATION WOULD HAVE THE COURAGE
TO RESIST THREATS AND AGGRESSION."
AS HIS PLANE TOUCHED DOWN AT NATIONAL AIRPORT,
THE PRESIDENT APPEARED GRIM.
"BY GOD," HE WOULD TELL HIS ADVISERS,
"I'M GOING TO LET THEM HAVE IT."
THAT SAME EVENING, TRUMAN AUTHORIZED WEAPONS AND SUPPLIES
TO REINFORCE THE SOUTH KOREANS.
THE NEXT DAY, HE ORDERED AMERICAN PLANES TO STRIKE
AT THE NORTH KOREAN ARMY.
TRUMAN HOPED THAT AMERICA'S SHOW OF STRENGTH
WOULD FORCE THE NORTH KOREANS TO BACK DOWN.
HE DID NOT WANT TO SEND AMERICAN SOLDIERS
TO FIGHT A LAND WAR IN ASIA.
BUT TRUMAN WAS BEING PUSHED CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE ABYSS.
ON JUNE 27, JUST THREE DAYS AFTER LAUNCHING THEIR ATTACK,
THE NORTH KOREAN ARMY OVERRAN SEOUL,
THE CAPITAL OF SOUTH KOREA.
THAT EVENING, TRUMAN APPEALED TO THE UNITED NATIONS FOR HELP.
"WE STARTED THE UNITED NATIONS," HE TOLD AN AIDE.
"IT MUST BE MADE TO WORK."
FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE WORLD ORGANIZATION DEVOTED TO PEACE
AUTHORIZED AN ARMY TO WAGE WAR.
BUT TRUMAN KNEW
THAT AMERICAN SOLDIERS WOULD CARRY THE BURDEN OF THE FIGHTING
AND THE PRESIDENT, UNWILLING TO RISK AMERICAN LIVES,
WITHHELD THE ORDER THAT WOULD SEND THEM INTO ACTION.
LaFeber:
I THINK THAT TRUMAN THOUGHT
THAT BY GETTING THE UNITED NATIONS TO CONDEMN THE ATTACK,
THAT BY BEEFING UP SOUTH KOREAN FORCES,
HE COULD PROBABLY HANDLE THE SITUATION.
THE COMMUNISTS WOULD LEARN THEIR LESSON, WOULD BACK OFF,
AND WE'D BE BACK TO BEFORE THE WAR.
McCullough:
HE WAS CONCERNED
THAT HE MIGHT BE TAKING THE WORLD INTO ANOTHER TERRIBLE WAR.
AND OF COURSE THIS TIME IT WOULD BE AN ATOMIC WAR,
BECAUSE NOW IT WAS KNOWN THAT BOTH SIDES HAD THE ATOMIC BOMB.
Narrator:
BY JUNE 30, LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THE FIGHTING BEGAN,
THE SITUATION SEEMED HOPELESS.
AMERICAN SUPPLIES AND PLANES HAD NOT BEEN ENOUGH
TO STOP THE RELENTLESS ADVANCE OF THE NORTH KOREAN ARMY.
THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO SEND AMERICAN BOYS.
Man:
I HEARD HIM SAY, "I KNOW THAT SOMEDAY
"I WILL HAVE TO STAND BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD
"AND ACCOUNT FOR EVERY YOUNG LIFE THAT IS ABOUT TO BE LOST
"BECAUSE OF WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO.
"BUT IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE OATH THAT I TOOK
WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT, I HAVE NO CHOICE."
AS ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO MIGHT BE COVERED BY THAT,
I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED.
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED WE WERE NOT DEALING
WITH A BANKRUPT HABERDASHER.
Narrator:
ON JUNE 30, THE PRESIDENT APPROVED
THE USE OF A COMBAT TEAM AND TWO DIVISIONS IN KOREA.
WHAT THE CHINESE OR THE RUSSIANS WOULD DO NOW,
HE WROTE IN HIS DIARY, HE DID NOT KNOW.
WHAT HE BELIEVED WAS
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD TO STAND FIRM.
"I'M NOT GOING TO TREMBLE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH BEFORE THE RUSSIANS,"
HE TOLD A WORRIED SENATOR.
"I AM NOT GOING TO SURRENDER OUR RIGHTS
OR THE RIGHTS OF THE SOUTH KOREANS."
Hamby:
TRUMAN HOPES THIS IS GOING TO BE A QUICK ENTERPRISE
AND WE CAN TAKE CARE OF IT.
CLEARLY, HE AND PERHAPS SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION
HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE FORMIDABLE CHARACTER
OF THE NORTH KOREAN ARMY.
Narrator:
THE FIRST AMERICANS THROWN INTO ACTION WERE GREEN.
THEIR ENEMY WAS NOT.
WELL TRAINED AND COMBAT HARDENED,
THE NORTH KOREANS PUSHED THE AMERICANS
FURTHER AND FURTHER SOUTH...
ACROSS UNKNOWN TERRAIN,
THROUGH DRENCHING DOWNPOURS AND PUNISHING HEAT.
TRUMAN'S CUTS IN THE DEFENSE BUDGET
HAD LEFT AMERICA UNPREPARED FOR THE WAR IT NOW FACED.
LaFeber:
BY JULY AND AUGUST OF 1950,
KOREA WAS A FULL-FLEDGED CONVENTIONAL WAR.
TRUMAN MADE THE DECISION AT THIS POINT
TO BUST THE DEFENSE BUDGET.
HARRY TRUMAN, WHO HAD OPPOSED HIGH DEFENSE BUDGETS,
HAD SENT A $13 BILLION DEFENSE BUDGET IN '49.
BY THE END OF 1950,
HE IS SENDING IN A DEFENSE BUDGET OF $50 BILLION,
AND THE UNITED STATES IS NOW BEGINNING TO MOVE
INTO THE PERIOD OF THE MODERN DEFENSE BUDGET.
Narrator:
WHILE THE MASSIVE REARMAMENT OF AMERICA
BEGAN AT HOME,
NEWS FROM THE FRONT REMAINED GRIM.
AT THE END OF JULY, 4,000 AMERICANS WERE DEAD,
ALMOST 14,000 WOUNDED OR MISSING.
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE SO MUCH STRONGER
THAN WE INITIALLY REALIZED
THAT THEY REALLY PRACTICALLY PUSHED US RIGHT OFF
INTO THE SEA.
Narrator:
THE UNITED NATIONS ARMY NOW CLUNG
TO ONLY A TINY CORNER OF THE SOUTHEASTERN TIP OF KOREA.
TRUMAN HAD EXPECTED TO OVERWHELM THE COMMUNISTS,
TO HURL THEM BACK ABOVE THE 38th PARALLEL INTO NORTH KOREA.
INSTEAD, AFTER JUST SIX WEEKS, THE WAR SEEMED LOST.
WITH DISASTER LOOMING,
A DARING PLAN WAS DEVISED BY THE HEAD OF UNITED NATIONS FORCES--
THE FABLED HERO OF WORLD WAR II WHOSE EXPLOITS IN THE PACIFIC
HAD MADE HIS NAME A HOUSEHOLD WORD,
GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR.
McCullough:
IT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TODAY
TO IMAGINE THE AURA AROUND GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR--
THE SIZE OF THE SHADOW HE CAST.
AMERICANS LOOKED UPON HIM AS A KIND OF GOD--
AN INFALLIBLE GOD.
HE WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE-FOOT NINE,
BUT IF YOU WERE IN HIS PRESENCE,
YOU WOULD SWEAR THAT HE WAS ABOUT SIX-FOOT SIX.
HE ALWAYS DOMINATED ANY GROUP, AND HE HAD ALL THE PROPS:
THE OPEN-COLLARED SHIRT, THE SUNGLASSES,
THE CRUSHED HAT, THE PIPE.
HE MADE HIS OWN LAWS.
HE TOOK UNCLEAR DIRECTIVES AND INTERPRETED THEM HIS OWN WAY.
HE WAS VERY MUCH THE AMERICAN CAESAR.
Narrator:
TO SAVE HIS ARMY TRAPPED ON THE TIP OF KOREA,
MacARTHUR SENT A MESSAGE TO TRUMAN ASKING HIM TO APPROVE
ONE OF THE MOST DARING OPERATIONS
IN AMERICAN MILITARY HISTORY.
Walters:
I ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.
HE SAID, "TELL THE PRESIDENT I WILL LAND AT INCHON
"ON THE 15th OF SEPTEMBER,
"AND BETWEEN THE HAMMER OF THIS LANDING
"AND THE ANVIL OF THE EIGHTH ARMY,
I WILL SMASH AND DESTROY THE ARMIES OF NORTH KOREA."
AND THE HAIR STOOD UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK.
Narrator:
ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1950, WITH TRUMAN'S FULL SUPPORT,
MacARTHUR STRUCK WITHOUT WARNING
AT THE PORT OF INCHON, 30 MILES FROM SEOUL.
THE RISKS WERE ENORMOUS:
DANGEROUS 30-FOOT TIDES,
ENEMY GUNS TRAINED ON MINE-INFESTED WATERS.
ONE PENTAGON STRATEGIST CALLED IT A 5,000-TO-ONE SHOT.
BUT MacARTHUR'S GAMBLE PAID OFF.
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE CAUGHT COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE.
INCHON FELL IN LESS THAN A DAY.
"I SALUTE YOU ALL," TRUMAN CABLED MacARTHUR,
"AND SAY TO ALL OF YOU FROM ALL OF US AT HOME,
'WELL AND NOBLY DONE.'"
13 DAYS LATER, SEOUL WAS RETAKEN.
AT THE SAME TIME, U.N. ARMIES IN THE SOUTH
WERE FIGHTING THEIR WAY NORTH WITH THE ENEMY IN FULL RETREAT.
McCullough:
SUDDENLY, THE NORTH KOREANS,
INSTEAD OF BEING THIS INVINCIBLE INVADING ARMY,
WERE CAUGHT IN A GIANT PINCER.
Narrator:
IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS,
MacARTHUR HAD TURNED THE WAR AROUND.
"GENERAL MacARTHUR," LIFE MAGAZINE WROTE,
"IS A GREAT SOLDIER AND A GREAT AMERICAN."
Narrator:
BY LATE SEPTEMBER,
U.N. FORCES HAD PUSHED THE COMMUNISTS
BACK ABOVE THE 38th PARALLEL--
THE LINE SEPARATING THE TWO ARMIES BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN.
THERE, MacARTHUR'S ARMY HALTED.
Elsey:
THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO RESTORE THE STATUS QUO.
THE INITIATIVE WAS NOT AN INTENT
TO CAPTURE NORTH KOREA AND UNIFY KOREA.
THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT AT ALL.
Narrator:
BUT TEMPTING THE PRESIDENT AND ALL HIS ADVISERS
WAS THE CHANCE TO DRIVE THE COMMUNISTS
ONCE AND FOR ALL FROM THE PENINSULA
BY CROSSING THE 38th PARALLEL
AND PURSUING THEM INTO NORTH KOREA.
TRUMAN FACED A DANGEROUS DECISION.
HE KNEW THAT TO ORDER THE TROOPS ACROSS THAT LINE
RISKED PROVOKING NORTH KOREA'S ALLY, CHINA;
THAT THE CHINESE ARMY
WAS ALREADY MASSING ON THE NORTH KOREAN BORDER;
THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
HAD ALREADY ISSUED EXPLICIT WARNINGS.
McCullough:
THE PREVAILING WISDOM AROUND THE PRESIDENT
WAS THAT THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD
THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD DO
WOULD BE TO GET INVOLVED WITH A MAJOR LAND WAR WITH THE CHINESE.
Narrator:
BUT WITH THE ENEMY IN RETREAT,
TRUMAN'S NATIVE OPTIMISM TOOK OVER.
ON SEPTEMBER 27,
MacARTHUR RECEIVED A MEMORANDUM FROM THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT.
"YOUR MILITARY OBJECTIVE," IT READ,
"IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NORTH KOREAN ARMED FORCES."
McCullough:
AND ACROSS THEY WENT,
HAVING BEEN WARNED THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS
THAT IF THEY PROCEEDED TO CROSS THE PARALLEL
THAT THE CHINESE WOULD COME INTO THE WAR.
BUT IT WAS FELT THAT THAT WAS A BLUFF.
Narrator:
TWO WEEKS LATER, TRUMAN PREPARED TO LEAVE AMERICA
ON A MISSION THAT CAUGHT EVERYONE BY SURPRISE.
"I'VE A WHALE OF A JOB BEFORE ME,"
TRUMAN WROTE HIS COUSIN.
"HAVE TO TALK TO GOD'S RIGHT-HAND MAN."
TRUMAN WAS HEADING FOR A TINY ISLAND
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC
TO MEET WITH GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR.
THE GENERAL HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE FOR THE PRESIDENT.
MacARTHUR'S OUTSPOKEN ANTI-COMMUNIST OPINIONS
HAD INFLAMED AN ALREADY TENSE SITUATION WITH THE CHINESE.
MANY FEARED MacARTHUR WANTED TO RETAKE
THE COMMUNIST CHINESE MAINLAND.
Battle:
MacARTHUR HAD A CONTEMPT FOR HIGHER AUTHORITY.
HE WAS HIS SUPREME AUTHORITY.
THAT'S THE WAY HE SAW HIMSELF.
HE WAS NOT TROUBLED
BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS UPON GENERALS.
HE WAS NOT TROUBLED BY ANY OBLIGATIONS HE HAD.
I'M SURE HE HAD A CERTAIN CONTEMPT FOR THE PRESIDENT.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH DOUBT OF THAT.
Narrator:
TRUMAN HAD NEVER LIKED MacARTHUR.
IN HIS DIARY, THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE GENERAL
AS "MR. PRIMA DONNA," "BRASS HAT,"
A "PLAYACTOR" AND A "BUNCO MAN."
"IT'S A VERY GREAT PITY WE HAVE TO HAVE STUFFED SHIRTS LIKE THAT
IN KEY POSITIONS," TRUMAN WROTE.
Simmons:
THE MEN WERE SO DISSIMILAR.
HERE WAS THIS IMPERIOUS FIGURE
VERY MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE MIDWESTERN COMMON MAN
WHO WAS TRUMAN.
Narrator:
AS TRUMAN HEADED FOR WAKE ISLAND
AND THE MEETING WITH HIS DOMINEERING GENERAL,
HE WAS DETERMINED TO LET MacARTHUR KNOW WHO WAS BOSS.
TRUMAN PUT ON HIS BEST PUBLIC FACE, BUT TENSIONS RAN HIGH
FROM THE MOMENT THE PRESIDENT GOT OFF THE PLANE.
Walters:
AND AS I RECOLLECT IT,
MacARTHUR SHOOK HANDS WITH THE PRESIDENT--
HE DID NOT SALUTE HIM,
WHICH STRUCK ME, AS A YOUNG OFFICER, RIGHT AWAY,
YOU KNOW, SORT OF ODD.
MANY YEARS LATER, I WAS IN INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI,
AND I SAW MR. TRUMAN, AND I SAID, "MR. PRESIDENT,
CAN I ASK YOU AN INDISCREET QUESTION?"
HE SAID, "WALTER, THERE ARE NO INDISCREET QUESTIONS.
"THERE ARE ONLY INDISCREET ANSWERS
"AND I'M A SPECIALIST IN THEM.
GO RIGHT AHEAD."
I SAID, "AT WAKE ISLAND, WHEN YOU EMERGED FROM THE AIRPLANE
AND STARTING DOWN THE STAIRS..."
AND HE INTERRUPTED ME:
"DID I NOTICE THAT
"MacARTHUR DID NOT SALUTE?
"YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I NOTICED IT!
AND I KNEW I WAS GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH HIM."
Narrator:
IN A DILAPIDATED CHEVROLET,
TRUMAN AND MacARTHUR SET OFF FOR A PRIVATE MEETING.
WITH THEM WAS TRUMAN'S SECRET SERVICE AGENT FLOYD BORING.
OH, MAN, TENSION?
I'LL SAY THERE WAS TENSION.
YOU COULD...
YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL IT, THE TENSION IN THE AIR.
Narrator:
BORING OVERHEARD THE PRESIDENT
LACE RIGHT INTO THE GENERAL.
Boring:
NEVER SAID "HOWDY" OR NOTHING.
THE PRESIDENT SAID TO HIM,
"I'M THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF," AND HE WAS MAD.
"I'M THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
"YOU'RE JUST...
YOU'RE A GENERAL IN THE ARMY-
- REMEMBER THAT.
"WHY DO YOU INSIST ON GOING INTO CHINA?
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT."
HE SAID, "I WANT YOU TO STOP IT.
"OTHERWISE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE RECALLED.
WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF YOU."
GENERAL MacARTHUR DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
YEAH, HE KNEW THE OLD MAN WAS MAD.
Narrator:
THE TENSION STILL LINGERED LATER THAT AFTERNOON
AS THE FORMAL MEETING GOT UNDER WAY
IN A PINK CINDER-BLOCK SHACK.
TRUMAN QUICKLY MOVED THE DISCUSSION
TO HIS MOST NAGGING FEAR.
Walters:
TRUMAN SAID, "ALL THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS WE HAVE
"INDICATE THAT THE CHINESE ARE PREPARING TO COME INTO THE WAR.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CHINESE COME IN?"
MacARTHUR ANSWERED AND SAID, "THEY WILL NOT ENTER THE WAR.
"AND IF THEY DO, I SHALL MAKE OF THEM
THE GREATEST SLAUGHTER IN THE HISTORY OF WARFARE."
Narrator:
MacARTHUR ASSURED THE PRESIDENT
THAT THE WAR WOULD BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS.
THE CONFERENCE RAN LESS THAN THREE HOURS.
THIS, THEIR FIRST MEETING, WAS TO BE THEIR LAST.
TRUMAN AND MacARTHUR WOULD NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.
Elsey:
TRUMAN THOUGHT THE MEETING WITH MacARTHUR
HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
HE'D BEEN ENCOURAGED BY macarthur'S ASSURANCE
THAT HE COULD BEGIN SENDING TROOPS BACK HOME BY CHRISTMAS.
SO HE CAME HOME CONFIDENT AND COMFORTABLE.
AND, OF COURSE, JUST A FEW WEEKS LATER,
CONTRARY TO macarthur'S ASSESSMENT,
THE CHINESE ENTERED IN FORCE AND THINGS JUST FELL APART.
Narrator:
ON NOVEMBER 24,
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION CHINESE COMMUNIST SOLDIERS
POURED INTO KOREA.
IN SPITE OF THE ASSURANCES HE HAD GIVEN THE PRESIDENT,
MacARTHUR, HOPELESSLY OUTNUMBERED,
WAS POWERLESS TO STOP THEM.
FOUR DAYS LATER, THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED A CABLE
FROM HIS BELEAGUERED GENERAL:
"WE FACE AN ENTIRELY NEW WAR.
"THIS COMMAND IS NOW FACED WITH CONDITIONS
BEYOND ITS CONTROL AND ITS STRENGTH."
ONE OBSERVER DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT
AS HE REPORTED THE NEWS TO HIS AIDES:
"HIS MOUTH GREW TIGHT, HIS CHEEKS FLUSHED.
"FOR A MOMENT, IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF HE WOULD SOB.
"THEN, IN A VOICE THAT WAS INCREDIBLY CALM AND QUIET,
"HE SAID, 'THIS IS THE WORST SITUATION WE HAVE HAD YET.
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO MEET IT AS WE'VE MET ALL THE REST.'"
VICTORY HAD APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN REACH.
NOW, IN THE BITTER KOREAN WINTER,
MacARTHUR'S FORCES REELED UNDER THE COMMUNIST ATTACK.
MacARTHUR TOLD THE PRESIDENT
HE FEARED HIS ARMY WAS ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED.
Simmons:
MacARTHUR'S BEHAVIOR IN THIS TIME PERIOD
IS VERY STRANGE.
THIS IS MacARTHUR, THE INVINCIBLE, THE INFALLIBLE,
BUT HE HAD FAILED.
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT EVACUATING THE EIGHTH ARMY FROM KOREA.
AND BEING MacARTHUR, IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIS FAULT.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT.
Narrator:
THE GENERAL URGED THE PRESIDENT
TO WAGE ALL-OUT WAR.
HE WANTED TO BLOCKADE THE CHINESE COAST
AND BOMB THE CHINESE MAINLAND.
TRUMAN REFUSED.
IN AN ATOMIC AGE, HE FEARED PROVOKING A THIRD WORLD WAR.
Simmons:
BOILED DOWN, MacARTHUR WANTED TO FIGHT THE WAR
TO WIN THE WAR.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
TRUMAN WANTED TO CONFINE THE WAR TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
HE WANTED TO KEEP IT AS SMALL AN AFFAIR AS POSSIBLE.
Narrator:
AS THE COMMUNISTS CONTINUED
TO PUNISH MacARTHUR'S ARMY, THE GENERAL TOLD REPORTERS
THAT HE WAS FIGHTING UNDER "AN ENORMOUS HANDICAP."
TRUMAN ORDERED THE GENERAL TO STOP TALKING TO REPORTERS.
MacARTHUR ESCALATED HIS DEMANDS.
LaFeber:
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY MacARTHUR PANICKED.
AT ONE POINT IN LATE DECEMBER, HE'S ASKING TRUMAN
TO TARGET 26 DIFFERENT AREAS WITHIN CHINA
FOR THE DROPPING OF NUCLEAR BOMBS.
I THINK MacARTHUR'S TOP PREFERENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN
TO USE SMALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE MASSES OF CHINESE.
AND HE FIGURED, TWO OR THREE,
THE CHINESE WOULD STOP AND WITHDRAW.
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT PREPARED TO MAKE THAT DECISION.
Narrator:
EACH DAY, TRUMAN'S WAR BECAME MORE AND MORE UNPOPULAR.
NEWSPAPER REPORTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS
OF AMERICAN BOYS CAPTURED, WOUNDED AND KILLED
UPSET AND CONFUSED ORDINARY CITIZENS.
TO A NATION ACCUSTOMED
TO THE GLORIOUS VICTORIES OF WORLD WAR II,
TO UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,
TO EVEN FORCING AN ENEMY TO SURRENDER WITH AN ATOMIC BOMB,
TRUMAN'S LIMITED WAR SEEMED SENSELESS.
Shulman:
THIS WAS PROBABLY THE WORST PART
OF THE PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION FOR HIM--
THE CASUALTIES WE WERE TAKING, THE PROTESTS FROM FAMILIES
AND THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING
WHAT A LIMITED WAR MEANT.
I MEAN, "WHY NOT NUKE 'EM?"
Narrator:
THE PRESSURE ON TRUMAN GREW INCREASINGLY INTENSE.
HE WAS WORKING 18-HOUR DAYS,
AND THE STRAIN WAS STARTING TO SHOW.
ONE MORNING, WITH UNITED STATES MARINES TRAPPED
AT A RESERVOIR IN NORTH KOREA, TRUMAN MET WITH HIS ADVISERS.
Shulman:
WE WERE WORKING ON A SPEECH,
AND MR. TRUMAN CAME IN FROM HIS OFFICE AND SAT DOWN
IN A VERY DEJECTED WAY, AND HE SAID,
"YOU KNOW, NORMALLY I SLEEP LIKE A BABY,
"BUT THIS TIME I COULD HARDLY SLEEP ALL NIGHT LONG.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THOSE BOYS UP AT THE RESERVOIR."
AND THEN HE SLUMPED IN HIS CHAIR AND HE...
HE SAID,
"YOU KNOW, THERE MUST BE A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
WHO CAN DO THE JOB BETTER THAN I CAN."
THERE ISN'T MUCH YOU CAN SAY TO THAT.
AND HE TOOK OFF HIS GLASSES AND PUT THEM ON THE TABLE,
AND THAT WAS A STARTLING THING FOR ME
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED
TO SEEING HIS EYES RATHER LARGE IN HIS FACE,
AND I REALIZED WHEN HE TOOK HIS GLASSES OFF,
IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY THICK LENSES
AND IT MAGNIFIED HIS EYES.
AND WHEN HE TOOK HIS GLASSES OFF,
HIS EYES APPEARED SMALL IN HIS FACE
AND IT CHANGED HIS APPEARANCE TO ME.
I STARED AT HIM JUST AS LONG AS I COULD POLITELY DO,
AND THEN HE PUT HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND HE SANK HIS...
HIS THUMBS INTO HIS EYE SOCKETS AND SAT THERE FOR A WHILE.
AND WE WERE ALL QUIET.
AND THEN FINALLY HE RAISED HIS HEAD
AND TOOK HIS GLASSES AND PUT THEM ON.
HE SAID, "BUT THE JOB IS MINE TO DO,
"SO I HAVE TO DO THE BEST I CAN.
LET'S GO ON WITH THE DRAFTING."
Narrator:
TENSION AND EXHAUSTION
WERE TAKING THEIR TOLL ON TRUMAN.
VICTORY IN KOREA WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT
OF HIS PRESIDENCY, PROOF THAT HIS DETERMINATION
TO HOLD THE LINE AGAINST COMMUNISM WAS WORKING.
INSTEAD, TRUMAN FACED DISASTER
AND IN THE DAYS AFTER THE CHINESE ATTACK, HE DRIFTED.
McCullough:
THIS WAS THE DARKEST TIME
OF HIS YEARS IN THE PRESIDENCY.
IT WAS A VERY BLEAK PROSPECT THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FACED,
AND THE PRESIDENT WAS BEING BESIEGED ON ALL SIDES.
Narrator:
ON DECEMBER 5,
HIS BELOVED FRIEND AND PRESS SECRETARY CHARLIE ROSS
DIED OF A HEART ATTACK.
TRUMAN HAD KNOWN ROSS SINCE HIGH SCHOOL,
AND THE SUDDEN LOSS OF HIS LIFELONG FRIEND
WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW.
McCullough:
AND TRUMAN WAS DEEPLY UPSET, DEEPLY DISTRAUGHT.
AND THAT WAS THE SAME NIGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER,
MARGARET TRUMAN, WAS HAVING A FIRST CONCERT EVER SINGING
IN CONSTITUTION HALL, IN WASHINGTON.
Narrator:
MARGARET HAD STUDIED TO BECOME A SINGER,
AND THE GRIEVING PRESIDENT KEPT HIS PROMISE
TO HEAR HER PERFORM,
HIS PENT-UP FRUSTRATIONS WAITING
LIKE A STICK OF DYNAMITE, READY TO EXPLODE.
(Margaret Truman singing)
Narrator:
PAUL HUME,
THE WASHINGTON POST'S RESPECTED MUSIC CRITIC,
HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR HIM
AS HE JOINED THE SELL-OUT CROWD.
Hume:
HERE WERE THE MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS,
THE SUPREME COURT, ALL THE BIG SHOTS--
THEY WERE ALL THERE TO HEAR HER SING...
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO SING WELL.
(Margaret Truman singing in Italian)
Hume:
AS SOON AS SHE STARTED TO SING,
I COULD TELL THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE
THE BASIC TECHNICAL CONTROL OF THE VOICE THAT YOU NEED.
THE PITCH WASN'T THERE, THE TONE WASN'T THERE.
SHE JUST DIDN'T HAVE WHAT IT TOOK.
I WOULD HAVE BEEN THRILLED
IF I COULD HAVE WRITTEN A RAVE REVIEW.
WHAT I WROTE WAS, "SHE IS FLAT A GOOD DEAL OF THE TIME,
"MORE LAST NIGHT
"THAN AT ANY TIME WE HAVE HEARD HER IN PAST YEARS.
"THERE ARE FEW MOMENTS IN HER RECITAL
"WHEN ONE CAN RELAX AND FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT SHE WILL MAKE HER GOAL, WHICH IS THE END OF THE SONG."
Narrator:
THE NEXT DAY,
TRUMAN OPENED THE WASHINGTON POST TO PAGE 12
AND FOUND PAUL HUME'S DEVASTATING CRITIQUE
OF HIS DAUGHTER'S SINGING.
THE PRESIDENT ERUPTED.
FURIOUS, HE DASHED OFF A SCATHING RESPONSE.
Hume:
THE LETTER CAME IN AND I OPENED IT UP
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, AND I...
GASPED.
Narrator:
"I'VE JUST READ YOUR LOUSY REVIEW
"OF MARGARET'S CONCERT.
"SOME DAY I HOPE TO MEET YOU.
"WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU'LL NEED A NEW NOSE,
"A LOT OF BEEFSTEAK FOR BLACK EYES
AND PERHAPS A SUPPORTER BELOW."
THAT'S STRONG LANGUAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Narrator:
WHEN THE LETTER BECAME PUBLIC,
NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BERATED THE PRESIDENT
FOR HIS LACK OF SELF-CONTROL.
THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE EVEN QUESTIONED
TRUMAN'S MENTAL COMPETENCE AND EMOTIONAL STABILITY.
McCullough:
HE WAS A MAN WHO WAS BEING BATTERED AND BESIEGED
FROM EVERY SIDE.
HE HAD TO BLOW HIS STACK ABOUT SOMETHING, IT SEEMS TO ME,
AND THE SOMETHING WAS PAUL HUME'S REVIEW.
Narrator:
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS FLOODED
WITH LETTERS AND TELEGRAMS.
ONE LETTER CAME FROM DISTRAUGHT PARENTS
WHO ENCLOSED A PURPLE HEART.
"AS YOU HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE LOSS OF OUR SON'S LIFE IN KOREA," TRUMAN READ,
"YOU MIGHT JUST AS WELL KEEP THIS EMBLEM.
"ONE MAJOR REGRET IS THAT YOUR DAUGHTER WAS NOT THERE
TO RECEIVE THE SAME TREATMENT AS OUR SON."
BY EARLY 1951,
THE COMMUNISTS HAD RETAKEN SEOUL AND INCHON
AND DRIVEN MacARTHUR'S FORCES BELOW THE 38th PARALLEL.
AGAIN, THE GENERAL URGED THE PRESIDENT TO WIDEN THE WAR.
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT REFUSED.
THEN, ON JANUARY 25,
THE LONGEST RETREAT IN AMERICAN MILITARY HISTORY ENDED.
MacARTHUR'S BLEAK ASSESSMENTS HAD BEEN WRONG.
HIS FIELD COMMANDER, GENERAL MATTHEW RIDGWAY,
TOOK UNITED NATIONS FORCES ON THE OFFENSIVE.
ASSAULTING THE COMMUNISTS WITH TANKS AND ARTILLERY,
RIDGWAY BEGAN DRIVING THEM BACK.
BY THE END OF MARCH, FORCES UNDER RIDGWAY'S COMMAND
HAD REACHED THE 38th PARALLEL ONCE AGAIN.
THERE THE WAR STALEMATED.
MORE THAN 50,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS
HAD BEEN KILLED OR WOUNDED.
SOUTH KOREAN CASUALTIES NUMBERED OVER 160,000.
TRUMAN CAUTIOUSLY BEGAN EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY
OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CHINESE
TO STOP THE FIGHTING AND RESTORE A DIVIDED KOREA.
Donovan:
WHAT TRUMAN WANTED
AND WHAT THE AMERICAN POLICYMAKERS WANTED
WAS TO GET OUT OF THERE AS DECENTLY AS WE COULD.
Narrator:
AT JUST THAT MOMENT, MacARTHUR STEPPED IN
AND UNDERMINED THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN.
THE GENERAL ISSUED HIS OWN PROCLAMATION
DEMANDING THE CHINESE COMMANDER SURRENDER TO HIM.
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN A RAGE.
MacARTHUR HAD WRECKED HIS HOPE FOR NEGOTIATIONS.
"I WAS READY TO KICK HIM INTO THE NORTH CHINA SEA,"
TRUMAN SAID LATER.
"I WAS NEVER SO PUT OUT IN MY LIFE."
Walters:
I GUESS IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND,
MacARTHUR FIGURED, "THIS IS A CAPTAIN OF ARTILLERY;
WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THIS WAR?"
AND IN TRUMAN'S MIND:
"I'M THE PRESIDENT;
I DECIDE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND MILITARY POLICY."
Elsey:
WITH GENERAL MacARTHUR MAKING
MORE AND MORE STATEMENTS
THAT WERE CALLING INTO QUESTION NATIONAL POLICY,
SOME OF TRUMAN'S ADVISERS BEGAN TO URGE
THAT HE RELIEVE THE GENERAL.
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING YOU JUST DON'T CASUALLY DO.
YOU DON'T RELIEVE A COMMANDER IN THE FIELD
IN THE MIDST OF MAJOR HOSTILITIES.
Narrator:
BUT WHEN MacARTHUR SENT A LETTER
TO THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER
CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT OF THE WAR,
TRUMAN HAD HAD ENOUGH.
"THIS LOOKS LIKE THE LAST STRAW," HE WROTE IN HIS DIARY.
"RANK INSUBORDINATION."
McCullough:
TRUMAN KNEW THE FIRESTORM HE WOULD FACE.
HE KNEW HE WOULD BE ATTACKED IN THE PRESS.
BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT EVENTUALLY
THE PEOPLE AND HISTORY WOULD SEE
THAT HE HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING.
Narrator:
ON APRIL 11, MacARTHUR WAS HAVING LUNCH IN TOKYO
WHEN HIS WIFE HANDED HIM A BROWN SIGNAL CORPS ENVELOPE.
"I DEEPLY REGRET," THE MESSAGE READ,
"THAT IT BECOMES MY DUTY AS PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF
"OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY FORCES,
TO REPLACE YOU AS SUPREME COMMANDER."
TRUMAN HAD FIRED ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR GENERALS
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
McCullough:
AND HE DID IT VERY ABRUPTLY,
AND HE DID IT KNOWING FULL WELL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.
Narrator:
MacARTHUR CAME HOME TO A HERO'S WELCOME.
ON CAPITOL HILL, REPUBLICANS ATTACKED TRUMAN.
SENATOR JOSEPH McCARTHY TOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE,
"THE SON OF A BITCH OUGHT TO BE IMPEACHED."
THE PRESIDENT WAS DELUGED WITH WILD TELEGRAMS
DENOUNCING HIM AS A PIG, A LITTLE MAN, A JUDAS.
McCullough:
WHO WAS HE, THIS LITTLE PIP-SQUEAK CAPTAIN
FROM WORLD WAR I,
TO FIRE THE GREAT, BELOVED, AWESOME GENERAL MacARTHUR?
Simmons:
MacARTHUR IS RECEIVED IN A TUMULTUOUS FASHION
IN EVERY CITY...
TICKER-TAPE PARADES...
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS--
HE ADDRESSED THE CONGRESS;
HE MADE THAT FAMOUS SPEECH.
I STILL REMEMBER THE REFRAIN
OF ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR BARRACK BALLADS OF THAT DAY,
WHICH PROCLAIMED MOST PROUDLY...
THAT "OLD SOLDIERS NEVER DIE..."
(some applause)
"THEY JUST FADE AWAY."
"OLD SOLDIERS NEVER DIE;
THEY SIMPLY FADE AWAY"--
I'VE NEVER BEEN QUITE SURE WHAT THAT MEANT,
BUT IT SOUNDS...
SOUNDS GREAT.
MacArthur:
AND LIKE THE OLD SOLDIER OF THAT BALLAD...
Narrator:
TRUMAN WASN'T LISTENING.
AS MacARTHUR SPOKE,
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH HIS SECRETARY OF STATE,
THEN TOOK A NAP.
LATER HE READ WHAT THE GENERAL HAD SAID
AND PRIVATELY REMARKED, "IT'S A BUNCH OF DAMN BULLSHIT."
Elsey:
TRUMAN TOOK IT ALL IN STRIDE.
HE SAID, "THIS WILL BLOW OVER.
"BRING THE GENERAL HOME,
"LET HIM HAVE HIS TICKER-TAPE PARADES-
- THAT'S OKAY.
ALL THIS WILL BE GONE IN A FEW MONTHS," AND IT WAS.
(artillery booming)
Narrator:
THE STALEMATE IN KOREA CONTINUED.
(heavy gunfire continues)
ON JULY 10, 1951, PEACE TALKS BEGAN, BUT THEY WOULD BOG DOWN
AND DRAG ON FOR THE REST OF TRUMAN'S DAYS IN OFFICE.
THE WAR IN KOREA WOULD GO ON,
IN THE END TAKING MORE THAN 54,000 AMERICAN LIVES.
TRUMAN'S ONLY COMFORT WAS IN KNOWING
THAT HE HAD KEPT THE STRUGGLE FROM SPREADING,
THAT HE HAD PREVENTED THE HORROR OF A FULL-SCALE NUCLEAR WAR.
Hamby:
THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE ADMINISTRATION
ARE BY FAR THE TOUGHEST OF TRUMAN'S PRESIDENCY.
HE REALLY BEGINS TO FEEL THE STRESS.
AND IN EARLY 1952, WHEN HE'S STILL TOYING AROUND
WITH THE IDEA OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT,
BESS TELLS HIM SHE DOESN'T THINK HE COULD SURVIVE ANOTHER TERM.
SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T THINK SHE COULD EITHER.
McCullough:
SHE HAD BEEN BIDING HER TIME, GRITTING HER TEETH
FROM THE TIME HE FIRST TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE IN 1945.
I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM HAD HE CHOSEN TO RUN AGAIN.
(applause)
Narrator:
ON MARCH 29, 1952,
TRUMAN TOLD HIS FELLOW AMERICANS WHAT MANY ALREADY SUSPECTED.
I SHALL NOT BE A CANDIDATE FOR RE-ELECTION.
I HAVE SERVED MY COUNTRY LONG
AND, I THINK, EFFICIENTLY AND HONESTLY.
I SHALL NOT ACCEPT A RENOMINATION.
I DO NOT FEEL THAT IT IS MY DUTY
TO SPEND ANOTHER FOUR YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
Narrator:
WITH HIS FAIR DEAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRAMS CRUSHED,
THE WAR STALEMATED IN KOREA, TRUMAN KNEW IT WAS TIME TO GO.
Man:
HIS RATINGS WERE LOWER
THAN NIXON'S ON THE DAY HE RESIGNED.
I MEAN, IT WAS PROBABLY AS LOW AN APPROVAL RATING
AS ANY PRESIDENT EVER HAD.
Narrator:
ONLY ONE PERSON RESPONDED WITH UNADORNED GLEE.
"WHEN YOU MADE YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT,"
AN AIDE TOLD THE PRESIDENT,
"MRS. TRUMAN LOOKED THE WAY YOU DO WHEN YOU DRAW FOUR ACES."
Elsey:
SHE'D HAD ENOUGH,
AND SHE THOUGHT HARRY TRUMAN HAD HAD ENOUGH.
HE'D DONE HIS DUTY.
HE'D DONE IT WELL.
IT WAS TIME TO CALL IT QUITS.
Narrator:
THAT JULY, THE DEMOCRATS CONVENED IN CHICAGO
TO NOMINATE ADLAI STEVENSON FOR PRESIDENT.
TRUMAN TOLD STEVENSON,
"ADLAI, IF A KNUCKLEHEAD LIKE ME CAN BE PRESIDENT
"AND NOT DO TOO BADLY,
"THINK WHAT A REALLY EDUCATED SMART GUY LIKE YOU COULD DO
IN THE JOB."
BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAD ALREADY NOMINATED THE HERO OF D-DAY,
GENERAL DWIGHT DAVID EISENHOWER.
THE DEMOCRATS, TRUMAN KNEW, DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.
WHEN THE CAMPAIGN WAS OVER,
TRUMAN'S DEMOCRATS HAD SUFFERED A DEVASTATING DEFEAT.
AFTER 20 YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS,
THE REPUBLICANS HAD RECAPTURED THE WHITE HOUSE.
McCullough:
THE SPOTLIGHT WAS ON THE NEW PRESIDENT.
AND THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT WAS SUDDENLY A CITIZEN AGAIN,
DRIVING AWAY IN A CAR, HAVING TO STOP AT A RED LIGHT
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN YEARS.
Narrator:
AFTER THE CEREMONY,
TRUMAN HAD LUNCH WITH HIS STAFF AND CABINET FOR THE LAST TIME.
Donovan:
AND WHEN HIS OLD FRIEND
THE RETIRING SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, JOHN SNYDER, ARRIVED,
HE SAW THE PRESIDENT STANDING LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.
AND SNYDER WENT OVER AND SAID,
"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW FOR?"
AND TRUMAN TURNED AROUND AND SAID,
"AN HOUR AGO, IF I HAD SAID SOMETHING,
"IT WOULD HAVE GONE AROUND THE WORLD IN 15 MINUTES--
ALL AROUND THE WORLD."
HE SAID, "NOW I COULD TALK FOR TWO HOURS
AND NO ONE WOULD GIVE A DAMN."
Narrator:
ON JANUARY 20, 1953,
HARRY TRUMAN, PRIVATE CITIZEN, SET OUT FOR HOME.
McCullough:
I'M NOT SURE THEY EXPECTED ANYBODY WOULD TURN UP
TO SAY FAREWELL.
BUT WHEN THEY SAW THE IMMENSE CROWD THAT HAD COME
AND THE CHEERING AND THE AFFECTION
THAT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE CROWD, THEY WERE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED.
(cheering)
Donovan:
AND I WENT BACK TO INDEPENDENCE WITH THEM,
AND IT WAS A SCREAM.
HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE TRAIN
AND SOMEONE WOULD BE SITTING IN A COMPARTMENT READING A PAPER
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN:
"HELLO THERE."
HERE'S HARRY, HERE'S PRESIDENT TRUMAN.
WE'D COME TO A STOP
AND HE'D GO UP AND BUY A NEWSPAPER AT THE NEWSSTAND
(laughing):
AND...
THE NEWSPAPER GUY.
AND HE WAS HAVING A GREAT HIGH TIME OF IT
AND SO, I THINK, WERE THEY.
IT WAS JUST A JOYOUS RIDE BACK TO INDEPENDENCE.
Narrator:
AFTER NEARLY 20 YEARS IN WASHINGTON,
HARRY AND BESS TRUMAN CAME HOME.
Bodine:
WHAT WITH HIS POPULARITY RATING
BEING SO LOW AND ALL OF THAT, THE GENERAL ASSUMPTION WAS
THERE WOULD BE MAYBE A FEW FRIENDS
AT THE RAILROAD STATION TO GREET THEM.
INSTEAD, AS I RECALL, I THINK THE CROWD WAS 10,000 PEOPLE.
WELCOME HOME, NEIGHBOR.
Man:
HOORAY FOR HARRY!
(cheering)
McCullough:
THE BIGGEST CROWD EVER
TURNED OUT IN THE LITTLE TOWN.
MRS. TRUMAN WAS SO TOUCHED BY THIS THAT SHE SAID
THAT THIS MAKES ALL THESE LAST YEARS
IN THE WHITE HOUSE WORTH IT.
Narrator:
TRUMAN WENT ON TO LIVE
IN THE OLD HOUSE ON NORTH DELAWARE STREET
THAT HAD ONCE BEEN HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S.
THERE HE WOULD SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
(rooster crows)
IN THE YEARS TO COME,
AMERICANS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING HARRY TRUMAN
PICTURED WALKING THE STREETS OF INDEPENDENCE
OR HEARING HIM BLUNTLY SPEAK HIS MIND.
NOW HE WAS ONE OF THEM,
AND THEY SEEMED MORE FOND OF CITIZEN TRUMAN
THAN PRESIDENT TRUMAN.
GRADUALLY HIS REPUTATION REVIVED.
AMERICANS BEGAN TO REMEMBER THE FORMER PRESIDENT
AS THAT FEISTY MAN FROM MISSOURI
WHO WORKED HARD AND WASN'T AFRAID TO SPEAK HIS MIND.
THEY REMEMBERED THE TRUMAN WHO SAID, "THE BUCK STOPS HERE."
McCullough:
HE'S A BELIEVABLE MAN.
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS HE IS SO APPEALING TO US.
HE HAS NO PRIVILEGED BACKGROUND.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT VOICE.
HE ISN'T HANDSOME.
HE HAS NO GLAMOUR.
BUT IN THAT MAKEUP IS IRON, REAL IRON.
Narrator:
IN 1961, EIGHT YEARS AFTER HE HAD LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE,
HARRY TRUMAN WAS INVITED BACK BY PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY.
ONCE AGAIN, TRUMAN SAT DOWN AT HIS OLD PIANO
AND PLAYED THE MUSIC HE HAD PRACTICED EVERY MORNING
AS A BOY.
(playing Paderewski's "Minuet in G")
TRUMAN PASSED HIS FINAL YEARS STILL RISING EARLY,
STILL TAKING HIS MORNING WALK,
JUST AS HE HAD DONE ALL HIS LIFE.
"I TRIED NEVER TO FORGET WHO I WAS AND WHERE I'D COME FROM
AND WHERE I'D GO BACK TO," TRUMAN SAID.
Shulman:
HARRY TRUMAN WAS A VINDICATION
OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEA OF LEADERSHIP.
HERE IS A MAN OUT OF THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA,
AN ORDINARY GUY, NOT A HIGH-POWERED INTELLECTUAL,
BUT A MAN OF COMMON SENSE AND A MAN OF PERSONAL DECENCY.
Narrator:
ON DECEMBER 26, 1972, HARRY TRUMAN DIED.
HE WAS 88 YEARS OLD.
TEN YEARS LATER, BESS WAS BURIED BESIDE HIM
IN THE COURTYARD OF THE LIBRARY THAT WAS NAMED IN HIS HONOR.
"WHEN FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT DIED," TRUMAN SAID,
"I FELT THERE MUST BE A MILLION MEN BETTER QUALIFIED THAN I
"TO TAKE UP THE PRESIDENTIAL TASK.
"BUT THE WORK WAS MINE TO DO, AND I HAD TO DO IT.
AND I TRIED TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN ME."
NARRATOR:
November 27, 1910 was a day New Yorkers had been anticipating for nearly a decade.
Pennsylvania Station, a monumental train terminal in the heart of Manhattan, finally opened to the public.
The excitement was palpable.
LORRAINE DIEHL:
There were throngs of people in the station that day.
It was as if someone took them to ancient Rome and ancient Greece.
I mean, they'd never seen anything like that.
NARRATOR:
Covering nearly eight acres, the building was the fourth largest in the world.
The main waiting room, which extended the length of two city blocks and rose 150 feet high, was comparable to the nave at St. Peter's in Rome in both size and splendor.
A French visitor openly sobbed, noted a reporter,
"Because such a beautiful affair was just a railway station."
Perched above the crowd was a statue of the man who had died bringing the station to life.
Alexander Cassatt, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, had defied legions of skeptics and gambled millions of dollars to link the nation's biggest railroad to America's greatest city.
It was a rare example of a private investment that would clearly benefit the public.
ALBERT CHURELLA:
Cassatt believed that he was performing a valuable service not only for his company but a valuable service for the country.
NARRATOR:
The unveiling of the station represented the culmination of an unprecedented engineering project:
the building of 16 miles of underground tunnels.
Seven miles were under the Hudson and East rivers, o of the busiest and most geologically complex waterways in the world.
KEITH REVELL:
When the Pennsylvania Railroad undertakes to build tunnels where nobody thought tunnels could be built, it's almost as though they are going to go to the moon.
JILL JONNES:
The scale of this was pharaonic.
It was huge.
It was the biggest civil engineering project of its time.
PAUL GOLDBERGER:
Pennsylvania Station is one of the greatest symbols of monumental public space that any American city has ever had.
It ennobles the acts of daily life.
It makes every citizen feel important.
DIEHL:
We were poor-- we didn't have very much.
My aunt said to me when I walked into Penn Station,
I felt like a queen because I felt as if someone had done that for me.
NARRATOR:
As 100,000 people streamed through its doors on opening day, a half-dozen granite eagles peered down on each entrance.
DIEHL:
The eagles represented the Caesars when they conquered new territory.
So here Alexander Cassatt finally conquered New York, and he'd surround his station with eagles.
NARRATOR:
Yet what no one that day could know was that Penn Station, built for the ages, would last only a few decades.
(whistle blowing)
NARRATOR:
In July 1901, Alexander Cassatt and his family began the first leg of their journey to Europe by boarding a train in Philadelphia bound for New York.
(whistle blowing)
As happened every time he traveled to the city,
Cassatt's train abruptly ground to a halt in New Jersey, on the western shore of the Hudson River.
There was no way across by train, an increasingly frustratg situation for the president of the nation's largest railroad.
Alexander Cassatt gets off into just total chaos, and what he and thousands of people are going to are ferries.
CHURELLA:
Every ten minutes, a Pennsylvania Railroad ferry headed across the Hudson River, threading a gauntlet of oceangoing ships, ferries operated by other railroads, tugs, lighters, car floats of one sort or another.
The congestion of watercraft on the Hudson River was becoming intolerable.
NARRATOR:
By the turn of the 20th century,
New York had emerged as the nation's preeminent metropolis, rivaling the great cities of the world.
Still, the Pennsylvania Railroad, which controlled over 10,000 miles of track extending through the American heartland, had no direct access into Manhattan.
CHURELLA:
For Cassatt, it was a matter of image and pride.
New York City was not just the largest city in the country, it was the nation's commercial hub.
And for the Pennsylvania Railroad to get so close, just one mile short of Manhattan, was to him unthinkable.
NARRATOR:
As Cassatt looked across the Hudson, he was reminded of his recent failure to solve his company's 30-year problem.
A plan for a bridge across the river had fallen through when a consortium of competing rail lines balked at sharing the cost of the $100 million project.
Cassatt realized if he wanted to get his line into New York, he would have to do it alone.
JONNES:
As Cassatt heads over to France, he's really, really disappointed.
This whole plan has fallen apart and they really have no fallback plan.
NARRATOR:
The Cassatts started their annual European holiday in London, then headed to Paris, where they visited Alexander's younger sister Mary, who had built a reputation as an Impressionist painter.
While in Paris, Cassatt received a cable from his vice president, Samuel Rea, who urged him to investigate the new Paris train station,
Gare d'Orsay.
The celebrated train terminal had been completed for the Paris Expositi of 1900.
The Gare d'Orsay's Beaux-Arts architecture impressed Cassatt.
Even more stunning was the station's innovative use of electric traction and tunnels.
JONNES:
Cassatt is an engineer.
He knows everything inside out about railroads, and he spends three days inspecting every aspect of these trains, the tunnels, the whole system.
CHURELLA:
What caught Cassatt's attention was that trains got there through a long tunnel-- a tunnel that was smoke-free because those trains were pulled by electric locomotives.
NARRATOR:
Unlike coal-burning locomotives, electric trains did not run the risk of asphyxiating their crew and passengers while passing through long tunnels.
Up to this point, they had primarily been used for lighter trolleys.
Now Cassatt watched powerful electric locomotives pull 300-ton passenger cars through a mile-long tunnel running along the river Seine to platforms below the station.
It was the idea of going electric, I think, that really brought all this together for Cassatt.
NARRATOR:
Cassatt envisioned his own electric trains gliding through tunnels under the Hudson River into Manhattan.
He cabled Rea that he believed this might be the solution.
JONNES:
The railroads completely remade and redefined every aspect of life in America.
They knit the whole country together and really created an entirely new economy, and it was a very industrialized economy and it was a very urbanized economy.
As the nation's largest railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad played a bigger role than most.
The Pennsylvania Railroad hauled more freight, it transported more passengers than any other railroad in the United States.
NARRATOR:
By 1900, the Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest corporation in the world.
With over 100,000 employees, its operating budget was second only to the federal government's.
Cassatt had been appointed president of the line in 1899 at the age of 59.
His career hadn't followed the typical path.
Born into a wealthy family, he had the means to retire at age 42 before being persuaded to return after the company's president died unexpectedly.
JONNES:
The board of directors asked him, would he consider taking on the presidency?
In a way, this was no small thing because almost every president of the Pennsylvania Railroad had died in office, so it was literally known as a killing job.
NARRATOR:
As a condition for accepting the job,
Cassatt demanded free rein to carry out his vision for the company.
CHURELLA:
Cassatt certainly did believe that he knew better than anyone how things should be run.
He understood the organizational and the financial complexity of the railroad industry.
NARRATOR:
The railroad thrived under Cassatt's leadership, nearly doubling its income in two years.
He's in a position to say,
"Let's do something really extraordinary that this company has been trying to do for years."
DIEHL:
New York City at the turn of the century was changing rapidly.
The entire city is pushing itself into the 20th century.
He wants to be part of the party.
He wants his railroad to be part of that.
He was really obsessed with taking his trains into Manhattan.
NARRATOR:
To help realize his new tunnel plan,
Cassatt tapped Samuel Rea to oversee the project and recruited Charles Jacobs, one of the world's foremost tunnel engineers.
Jacobs had become prominent building a small natural gas tunnel under the East River, the first underwater tunnel into Manhattan.
CHURELLA:
Charles Jacobs understood, perhaps better than anybody else in the world, the practicalities of building underwater tunnels.
NARRATOR:
The plan was daunting:
16 miles of tunnels that would link the Pennsylvania Railroad's sprawling system to New York City and New England.
Two tunnels would be bored under the Hudson River from New Jersey to Manhattan, where they would open up into tracks 50 feet below street level, leading to the railroad's terminus in the heart of the city.
Four tunnels would continue under the East River and emerge in Long Island, where they would connect with the recently acquired Long Island Rail Road.
The final piece would be the Hell Gate Bridge, a span over the East River extending the rail lines northward to New England.
For the company's new terminal,
Cassatt envisioned an architectural tour de force along the lines of the Gare d'Orsay, only twice as big.
The expected price tag of the project was $50 million.
The Pennsylvania would take on this massive venture alone, giving it exclusive access to the tunnels.
CZITROM:
The ambition and the scope of the Pennsylvania Railroad project reflect something about America at the turn of the century.
People identify these same themes with works like the Brooklyn Bridge, with the building of the first subways, with the building of the Panama Canal.
But unlike some of the other great engineering feats of the late 19th, early 20th century, this is not being done with any government subsidy.
This is being done by a private corporation.
JONNES:
They feel as if they're doing this great civic deed.
They are actually going to finally attach New York City, which is the most important city in the country, to the mainland.
NARRATOR:
It began quietly.
In the fall of 1901, three men went door to door, buying up real estate in the Tenderloin, a working-class neighborhood that was also one of Manhattan's most notorious vice districts.
Snapping up shabby tenements, saloons, dance halls, gambling joints and warehouses, the men worked to get the lowest prices possible.
JONNES:
They had no idea who they were buying property for, and they went out into these blocks in the Tenderloin and just began looking for owners.
They had giant wads of cash, and if someone was willing to sell their building, they would pay them on the spot.
NARRATOR:
The buyers needed to purchase the four blocks from West 31st Street to West 33rd Street between 7th and 9th Avenues.
The area was to be the site of the Pennsylvania Railroad's Manhattan terminal, but that was a closely guarded secret.
CZITROM:
The idea is that once we buy these buildings up, we're going to tear them all down.
They want to do this before it becomes publicly known that they're buying everything up.
That's the way to keep the prices down.
NARRATOR:
When news of the tunnels leaked out, it stunned the public.
JONNES:
People still assumed that somehow or another, they were in pursuit of a bridge.
The idea that you would build tunnels was not on anyone's mind because it was not viewed as technically possible.
CHURELLA:
Cassatt certainly understood that driving a tunnel under the Hudson River was a risky business.
In the 1870s, DeWitt Clinton Haskin had tried to build a tunnel under the Hudson River and had suffered a series of blowouts, one of which killed 20 people.
The project was abandoned-- proof, critics said, that it just couldn't be done.
VINCE TIROLO:
The geologic conditions for the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels in the Hudson River were difficult.
The soil that you're mining through is a soft silt.
So there was a lot of concern about whether the tunnel in that soft material would stay in position or would settle.
NARRATOR:
A typical Pennsylvania Railroad passenger train weighed 700 tons.
The tunnels would need to withstand hundreds of them every day.
REVELL:
Building a tunnel of that size to handle that level of traffic is going to be an extraordinary undertaking.
When you put several hundred tons of railroad car underneathhe river in that silt, the likelihood is that things are going to start to move around, and you don't want a railroad tunnel underneath the water to start moving around.
CHURELLA:
What concerned Samuel Rea was that the tunnels wouldail, and in failing doom the entire project.
NARRATOR:
Cassatt had already spent $5 million buying up land for his Manhattan train station.
Now he was betting ten times that amount on what many considered a mad and reckless pursuit.
(birds chirping)
NARRATOR:
On a spring day in 1902,
New York architect Charles McKim was in Washington to discuss a renovation of the White House with President Theodore Roosevelt.
While there, McKim received an unexpected telegram from Alexander Cassatt, requesting a meeting.
"I suppose President Cassatt wants a new stoop for his house," McKim joked.
McKim hurried to the Pennsylvania Railroad's offices in Philadelphia the next day.
He spent the morning with Cassatt, who described his plans for a new railroad station in Manhattan.
Alexander Cassatt wanted a monument.
He didn't want a simple opening into an underground space.
He wanted a monument to his company that could express the importance of the railroad and the ambitions of New York City, that captured its sense of itself as a world capital.
GOLDBERGER:
Cassatt was a very unusual executive.
He not only knew how to run a railroad, he really did have a grand vision and he wanted the Pennsylvania Railroad to stand for the grandest, the noblest, the most elegant, the most inspiring.
He saw in McKim the kind of architect who would give him that.
NARRATOR:
Along with Stanford White and William Mead,
McKim had founded one of the country's most famous architectural firms.
GOLDBERGER:
McKim, Mead White were kind of the top guys in town.
And Charles McKim was a strong-willed, earnest believer in the nobility of Classical architecture.
NARRATOR:
McKim had made his name designing civic spaces like the Boston Public Library and the campus of Columbia University.
Although he had never designed a train station, he created works on a heroic scale.
By the end of their meeting,
Cassatt had commissioned McKim to design Pennsylvania Station.
In the Tenderloin, about 500 buildings were soon torn down, displacing hundreds of families to make way for Cassatt's new terminal.
McKim marveled at the huge expanse:
a sprawling, blank canvas on which he could design a monument for the ages.
NARRATOR:
On June 24, 1903, Charles Jacobs stepped up on a wooden platform next to a large pneumatic drill and began drilling down into the bedrock of Manhattan.
The massive hole would soon be a 55-foot deep shaft for tunneling under the Hudson River.
At the same time, workers sunk a similar shaft in Weehawken, New Jersey.
Construction had begun on what Engineering News lauded as "the most extensive and difficult piece of submarine tunnel work ever undertaken."
The shafts would be the access points for simultaneously digging two tunnels that would meet up under the Hudson River.
On the other side of Manhattan, crews would burrow four tunnels under the East River, also starting from each shore and connecting in the middle.
At the contractor's field offices, doctors began examining hundreds of applicants for jobs as tunnel workers, called sandhogs.
The dangerous work drew men from all different nationalities and ethnic groups:
Irish, Italian, Polish, West Indian, African-American.
At the shaft entrances, a makeshift elevator transported sandhogs to the dank depths of their underground work.
Tunneling never stopped:
three eight-hour shifts a day, seven days a week.
Rows of steam engines pumped the lifeblood of compressed air into the tunnel below.
TIROLO:
Compressed air means you're raising the pressure of the air inside the tunnel to a pressure that's equal to the pressure of the water trying to come in.
Now, the water's trying to flow inside the tunnel and you're pushing on the face of the tunnel with a pressure equal to the pressure of the water.
That compressed air pressure keeps the water from coming in.
NARRATOR:
To bore under the river, the engineers used a Greathead shield.
Weighing nearly 200 tons, the shield was a steel cylinder with a diameter of 23 feet in which the tunnel was constructed.
The head of the shield had nine compartments with doors, allowing for the extraction of earth and rock, called "muck,"
from the face of the tunnel.
In the tail of the shield, the tunnel was built by assembling a series of two-and-a-half foot wide cast-iron rings, each made up of 12 segments bolted together by hand.
As each ring was put in place, hydraulic jacks pushed the shield forward so that another ring could be erected.
TIROLO:
The process is kind of an inchworm process.
You erect a ring, you jack forward, you pull the jacks back, you erect another ring.
And out the back of the shield, you're getting this continuous line of cast-iron rings.
NARRATOR:
In the beginning, it took sandhogs about six hours to put a ring segment in place.
With experience, they soon could build one every 90 minutes.
TIROLO:
Excavation was essentially hand labor.
Generally speaking, it was done with a spade.
And the rock was drilled by a pneumatic hammer held by a sandhog.
SCOTT CHESMAN:
It's grueling.
There's tremendous power down there that needs to be used and if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're going to get crushed.
Equipment moving in and out, muck cars full of muck--
I mean, they weigh tons.
If you're not paying attention, you're going to get hit.
And when you're in a confined space and anything can happen, there is nowhere to run.
NARRATOR:
Concerned about the tunnel settling in the soft silt,
Jacobs had engineers measure the alnment and grade every second to fourth ring.
As the enormous shields crept towards each other,
Jacobs knew there was no margin for error.
(explosion)
NARRATOR:
At the site of the new station and its accompanying train yard, work gangs began to dig, drill, dynamite and cart out tons of muck.
Construction crews worked day and night to excavate the 28-acre expanse.
JONNES:
It's just block after block after block that's going down, down, down.
They're having to prop up entire avenues including above the avenues, the elevated railroads, and then excavating around all of the underground infrastructure that's there:
the sewer pipes, the water pipes.
It's an amazing engineering feat.
CZITROM:
The construction site also became an object of fascination for ordinary passersby who were just struck by the breathtaking size of this operation.
It was almost an unworldly scene that was going on.
Nobody had ever seen a hole this big and nobody had ever seen an excavation project this ambitious.
The newspapers and other observers would constantly refer to the excavation job as being our own Panama Canal here on the west side of Manhattan.
NARRATOR:
Just blocks from the excavation site,
Charles McKim was working intensely on designs for a lofty space to celebrate what he called
"the entrance to one of the great metropolitan cities of the world."
For inspiration,
McKim studied the great buildings of ancient Rome, in particular the Baths of Caracalla, which he had recently visited.
GOLDBERGER:
The Romans believed that public buildings were inherently noble things.
They were not just functional.
He looked at the Baths of Caracalla and decided that there was the model for the great space of a train station.
This is saying that we can evoke the grandeur of ancient Rome and make it part of modern New York.
NARRATOR:
Cassatt had also visited the Baths and was equally taken with them.
CZITROM:
He was not solely interested in aggrandizing power.
He was a man of culture, of taste, of fine art.
He paid tremendous attention to aesthetics and beauty and great architecture.
DIEHL:
Alexander Cassatt and Charles McKim, they both had a very deep, keen respect for beauty.
They decided on how the station should be built with that same dream in their heads.
NARRATOR:
McKim dreamed big.
His grand design included importing Italian travertine marble, the same material used in ancient Roman monuments, for the interior.
For the exterior, he chose lustrous pink Milford granite from Massachusetts.
He built full-scale models of the facade to study the proportions of his design.
When the railroad's board of directors pushed to include a revenue-generating hotel on top of the station, McKim was appalled.
He argued that this would compromise the artistic integrity of the building.
Cassatt was won over, but his engineers also gave him a practical reason to oppose the hotel.
The additional support columns needed, they told him, would necessitate the removal of two or more tracks.
Cassatt quickly dropped the idea.
CHURELLA:
He was intimately involved in the design of the structure of Penn Station, and Penn Station embodies AlexandeCassatt's vision as much as it does Charles McKim's vision.
NARRATOR:
Tunnel construction under the Hudson had proved easier and faster than expected, and Charles Jacobs was exuberant over the progress.
By the spring of 1906, New York and New Jersey sandhog crews raced to be the first to reach the middle of the river.
On the other side of Manhattan, however, tunneling under the East River was turning into a nightmare.
CHURELLA:
The tunnels under the Hudson were easy compared to the tunnels under the East River.
The East River overlay a complex strata of gravel, clay, sand, silt, bedrock, even.
And it was proving extraordinarily difficult for crews to tunnel through that.
NARRATOR:
Every time the sandhogs hit pockets of sand and gravel, they ran the risk of air leaking from the tunnels.
"The geysers formed by the leaks,"
reported the New York Times,
"have made the water in the ferry slips look like boiling lakes."
Inside the tunnel, sandhogs were constantly on the alert for a whistling sound:
the telltale sign that compressed air was escaping and might at any moment punch a hole through the riverbed-- what was known as a blowout.
It's like a ship being hit by a torpedo.
When a ship gets hit by a torpedo, everybody runs to the opening and they try to plug the leak.
They'll try using anything they have on hand.
They'll use blankets, they'll use hay, whatever they can to stop the air.
If a sandhog is unlucky enough to be at that point where the air is leaking and all of a sudden the air leaks at one time, that man will be blown out into the river with the air.
NARRATOR:
Constant blowouts put them desperately behind schedule, and costs were skyrocketing.
In April 1906, the lead engineer told Cassatt that work had stopped on three of the four tunnels.
JONNES:
They find it very, very hard to keep the compressed air in these tunnels.
They're blowing all the time.
And there have been a lot of deaths and a lot of cases of the bends.
CHURELLA:
The situation under the East River was going from bad to worse.
In the absence of first-hand information, reporters often exaggerated the number of deaths and injuries, and this created an intense public image problem for the Pennsylvania Railroad.
NARRATOR:
As dawn broke on June 20, 1906, ferry passengers heading across the Eastiver to Manhattan heard a horrific roar.
(loud roaring and splashing)
An enormous geyseruddenly erupted out of the water.
86 feet below the surface, sandhogs scrambled for safety as a massive blowout flooded much of the southernmost Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel.
Two sandhogs drowned.
Casst and Rea rushed to New York.
Rea assured the press that the tunnels were only a few months behind schedule and the delays were not alarming.
A representative for the contracting firm admitted that 14 men had died from the bends:
more than they expected, but half as many as the newspapers were claiming
To help reduce blowouts, he explained they would dump tons of clay into the river to seal the riverbed.
Still, Cassatt realized he needed to counter the mounting bad press.
Four months earlier, he had hired Ivy Lee, a pioneer in the field of public relations.
Now Cassatt charged Lee with managing the stories swirling around the tunnels.
Later that summer, for the first time since the start of the project, the Pennsylvania Railroad allowed a journalist to take a tour of the tunnels.
CHURELLA:
Ivy Lee understood that the way to capture the public's attention was not to release dry statistical data, but rather to make sure the public understands something about the romance, the excitement and the adventure associated with this great endeavor:
that this is a dark and mysterious subterranean world in which heroic men are carrying forth the progress of a nation.
(drilling and hammering)
NARRATOR:
On the evening of September 11, 1906, after three years of tunneling and a full year ahead of schedule, thtwo halves of the north tunnel met under the Hudson River.
Under Charles Jacobs' careful eye, their alignment was off by only 1/16 of an inch.
TIROLO:
Even today, an accuracy of 1/16th of an inch in tunnels meeting is still excellent.
So the fact that they were able to do it back then, it's amazing.
NARRATOR:
Jacobs led an inspection party through the tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan.
The group cheered as the engineer became the first person to pass through from one side to the other.
As others followed, a cry went out:
"Three cheers for the sandhogs!"
CHURELLA:
Far from speculating about how this project might not work or might be too dangerous, reporters gushed over the marvels of the tunnels:
the sheer novelty of being able to walk underneath the Hudson River from New York to New Jersey.
NARRATOR:
Noticeably absent from all the celebration were Alexander Cassatt and Samuel Rea.
For the past five months, they had been preoccupied with troubling news.
Measurements showed that the Hudson River tunnels were shifting up and down in the silty river bottom.
Cassatt had the engineers increase the weight of the cast-iron linings to settle the tunnels, but the shifting continued.
CHURELLA:
There is a very real fear that the tunnels would simply keep sinking, the tunnels might crack, they might lie forever broken, flooded, abandoned underneath the Hudson River, a monument to the folly of the Pennsylvania Railroad's efforts to reach Manhattan.
NARRATOR:
Rea pressured his engineers to find an answer.
Jacobs suggested attaching screw piles to the bedrock below to support the tunnels.
Rea was not convinced.
After months of measurements, experiments and debate,
Jacobs finally figured out what suddenly seemed obvious:
the tunnels were moving with the tide.
When the tide came in, the increased volume of water pushed the tunnels down.
Then they would spring back up as the tide receded.
This explained the shifting, but a terrifying unknown remained.
JONNES:
What does that mean for the ultimate fate of the tunnels?
Are they going to keep sinking once they have very heavy trains going through them every day?
And the truth is no one knows.
So this is this terrible secret that hangs over Samuel Rea.
NARRATOR:
Three days after Christmas in 1906,
Alexander Cassatt was working from his home in Philadelphia, still weakened after a bout with whooping cough he had contracted the previous summer.
Resting with his wife by his side, he suffered a heart attack and died.
He was 67.
He had become the fourth Pennsylvania Railroad president to die in office.
JONNES:
Cassatt was enormously admired, and he had this very unusual and unique position of being viewed almost as a public servant, and that his corporation had this larger, more idealistic role to play, which was to help make America great.
DIEHL:
Watching this building rise, watching these beautiful columns rise almost like the temple of Athena-- people must have been awestruck by that.
JONNES:
It really looks like some aspect of ancient Rome is rising in the middle of what's left of the Tenderloin.
And it began to sink in that something truly extraordinary was happening in Manhattan.
NARRATOR:
By the time the masonry work started on Pennsylvania Station in 1908, sandhogs had joined the tunnels under the East River, making it possible to travel underground from New Jersey to Long Island.
CHURELLA:
At the time Penn Station was built, most people believed that railroads were symbols of progress, symbols of modernity, symbols of what the United States could achieve.
NARRATOR:
It had taken four years to build Pennsylvania Station.
McKim's colossal structure used 27,000 tons of steel, 500,000 cubic feet of granite,
83,000 square feet of skylights and 17 million bricks.
REVELL:
When the station is completed in 1910, Samuel Rea says,
"We started this project
"with a great deal of skepticism from onlookers.
"They now see that we have built for the future.
It's part of a system that's going to be here for years."
NARRATOR:
On opening day, thousands of entranced spectators wandered through the station.
"They flooded the acres of its floor space,"
reported the New York Tribune,
"gazed at the vaulted ceilings far above them,
"and pressed like caged creatures against the grill
"which looked down upon subterranean tracks, trains and platforms."
GOLDBERGER:
Pennsylvania Station was a symbol not only of the greatness and power of the railroad, but also of the greatness and power of the city.
It was a gift to the city as well as a creation of a corporation and this notion that private enterprise and the public good didn't contradict each other, they in fact reinforced each other.
My first memory of Penn Station is one that is indelible.
I was about ten years old.
I walk into this train shed.
I felt such a sense of wonder and motion.
The late morning sun is coming in and all the little particles of dust are frozen there-- they're just sort of dancing in the air-- and I'm just saying to myself, "This is a wondrous place."
(hammers pounding)
NARRATOR:
Seven years after Penn Station opened,
Samuel Rea, now president of the railroad, dedicated the last piece of Cassatt's grand plan:
the Hell Gate Bridge.
The world's longest steel arch bridge at the time, it finally connected the Pennsylvania Railroad to New England.
By then, 18 million people traveled through Penn Station every year, and hundreds of trains rumbled through the tunnels day after day.
Rea's worst fears had been unfounded.
The tunnels held up.
Traffic particularly exploded on the Long Island Rail Road, which brought an increasing number of commuters into Manhattan through the East River tunnels.
Within a decade, two-thirds of the passengers arriving in Penn Station were coming from the suburbs.
CZITROM:
The creation of Penn Station in some ways had a greater impact not on the city but on the suburbs.
The opening up of Queens and Long Island and New Jersey was in some ways, I think, an unintended consequence of all this.
NARRATOR:
By 1945, more than 100 million passengers a year traveled through Penn Station, exceeding Cassatt's wildest dreams.
DIEHL:
Penn Station was a place not only of journeys, but a place of memories.
Those walls actually held the history of the country in a way.
It held time in that it held memory.
GOLDBERGER:
Great architecture can imbue daily life with a sense of wonder and majesty and joy.
Penn Station was perhaps the greatest single public space of all.
CHURELLA:
There's a great irony that Penn Station was finally used to capacity during World War II, but at that moment of triumph, the Pennsylvania Railroad was on the verge of decline.
And the next year, 1946, the company lost money for the first time in its history.
Cassatt planned his program of improvements perfectly for the world he believed would exist 50 years in the future.
He never envisioned a world in which more people would travel by car or by plane than by train.
NARRATOR:
Within the lifetime of many who had seen it open came the end of Pennsylvania Station.
What was supposed to last forever to herald and represent the American empire was slated for destruction.
BALLON:
The Pennsylvania Railroad was struggling, and it's in desperate financial condition.
It could no longer forfeit the real estate revenues of its site in Manhattan, something it had forgone when the railroad was originally built but which now is impossible.
Their job was not to preserve the architectural landscape of New York City.
Their job was to protect their company.
DIEHL:
The Pennsylvania Railroad owned it.
The Pennsylvania Railroad could therefore destroy it.
It was a very, very tough thing to understand because it was a public space.
Even though it was built for us, we didn't own it.
We just used it.
NARRATOR:
In 1961, the financially strapped Pennsylvania Railroad announced it had sold the air rights above Penn Station.
The company would tear down what had once been its crowning jew to build Madison Square Garden, a high-rise office building and sports complex.
A few people protested, but to no avail.
On the rainy morning of October 28, 1963, the demolition began.
"Until the first blow fell, no one was convinced that Penn Station really would be demolished,"
wrote the New York Times,
"or that New York would permit this monumental act of vandalism against one of the finest landmarks of its age."
BALLON:
The demolition of Pennsylvania Station represented a tremendous loss of hope for the city:
that it has surrendered one of its great pieces of public architecture.
DIEHL:
For most people, it wasn't until that station was torn down that they understood what was taken from them.
Vincent Scully said,
"Where once we entered like kings, we exit like rats."
You never get over the fact that such a wonderful place is gone.
GOLDBERGER:
Penn Station was really the great martyr of historic preservation, the building that died so that we might save others in the future.
What Penn Station was was the tipping point:
something that people simply wouldn't accept anymore.
And so then there was the political will to do something about it.
NARRATOR:
In the wake of the destruction, New York City established the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Grand Central Terminal was designated a historic landmark in 1967, sparing it from the fate of Penn Station.
CZITROM:
It does help inspire a whole new consciousness about the importance of saving great buildings.
But anybody who knows New York understands that that's always an uphill battle:
that the power of commerce, the devotion to change, the fetish of what's coming next really worked against what McKim and Cassatt had created.
CHURELLA:
The architectural edifice of Penn Station may be gone, but the tracks and the tunnels remain and carry millions of people in and out of Manhattan every year.
That was the most valuable part of the entire project, and that survives.
GOLDBERGER:
Penn Station represents the aspiration of doing something monumental and noble, of private enterprise creating something extraordinary for the benefit of the public.
It was an investment that generations that followed would benefit from.
The challenge is how you balance the need to preserve what's best, what's most important, and the need to continually invent and change and grow, because that's what living places have to do.

MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION.
( crowd cheering )
McCullough:
THE 1964 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WAS ALL LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON.
AFTER YEARS OF COMPROMISE AND OPPORTUNISM,
HE FIRED AMERICA WITH HIS VISION OF A GREAT SOCIETY.
Johnson:
OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO FREE 30 MILLION AMERICANS
FROM THE PRISON OF POVERTY.
CAN YOU HELP US FREE THESE AMERICANS?
AND IF YOU CAN, LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICES.
( whistling and cheering )
McCullough:
HE REACHED OUT TO THE POOR, THE DISPOSSESSED
TO AMERICANS WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND.
Johnson:
DO SOMETHING WE CAN BE PROUD OF.
HELP THE WEAK AND THE MEEK AND LIFT THEM UP AND HELP THEM TRAIN
AND GIVE THEM AN EDUCATION WHERE THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN WAY.
McCullough:
CAMPAIGNING WITH THE ENERGY OF TEN MEN--
"AS IF HE HAD AN EXTRA PAIR OF GLANDS," ONE AIDE SAID--
HE SOUNDED THE BATTLE CRIES OF HIS POLITICAL YOUTH,
ECHOING HIS VERY FIRST CAMPAIGN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BEFORE.
IN THE SPRING OF 1937, JOHNSON WAS 28 YEARS OLD,
CAMPAIGNING AS AN ARDENT ROOSEVELT NEW DEALER,
REACHING OUT TO THE WORKING MEN AND POOR DIRT FARMERS
OF THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY.
HE RAN FOR OFFICE AS IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.
HE SPOKE IN EVERY TOWN IN HIS DISTRICT,
LOST 40 POUNDS IN 42 DAYS, MADE 200 SPEECHES
AND COLLAPSED WITH APPENDICITIS
JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION.
FROM HIS HOSPITAL BED, WITH HIS WIFE LADY BIRD,
HE LEARNED THAT HE'D BEEN ELECTED
ONE OF THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
HIS POLITICAL IDEALS WOULD WAVER,
BUT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
HE WOULD DISPLAY THE SAME NERVOUS INTENSITY,
THE SAME OBSESSIVE DRIVE TO SUCCEED
AND A TALENT FOR ATTACHING HIMSELF TO POWER.
ONE MONTH AFTER JOHNSON'S ELECTION
THE PRESIDENT PAID A HOLIDAY VISIT TO GALVESTON, TEXAS.
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT WAS LYNDON JOHNSON'S POLITICAL HERO.
NOW THE AMBITIOUS NEW CONGRESSMAN SEIZED
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET HIM.
Lady Bird Johnson:
THE GOVERNOR WAS GOING DOWN TO PAY HIS RESPECTS,
SO HE CALLED LYNDON AND SAID, "I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU ALONG
"BECAUSE YOU RAN SO COMPLETELY ON ROOSEVELT'S PLATFORMS
THAT I THINK HE OUGHT TO MEET YOU."
AND LYNDON WAS THERE WITH HIS EYES OUT ON STEMS
TAKING IN EVERY WORD AND EVERY GESTURE.
McCullough:
THEY TALKED ABOUT FISHING, ABOUT THE NAVY.
THEN JOHNSON ASKED FOR AN ASSIGNMENT
TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT WOULD HAVE TO WAIT.
Man:
HERE ARE THE TWO GREAT POLITICIANS IN AMERICAN HISTORY
IN THIS CENTURY, I BELIEVE, AND THEY'RE SIZING EACH OTHER UP,
AND ROOSEVELT GIVES HIM THE NAME OF TOMMY CORCORAN,
TOMMY THE CORK, THE WHITE HOUSE AIDE, THE WASHINGTON "FIXER",
AND HE TELLS JOHNSON, "IF YOU NEED ANYTHING
WHEN YOU GET TO WASHINGTON, YOU CALL UP MR. CORCORAN."
WELL, ROOSEVELT HIMSELF GETS BACK TO WASHINGTON
AND HE CALLS UP CORCORAN, THE STORY GOES, AND HE SAYS TO HIM,
"TOMMY, I JUST MET THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG MAN
DOWN IN TEXAS."
"WITH ANY LUCK,
"IF THE CHIPS GO RIGHT,
"AND HE HANGS ON TO THE FRIENDS HE MAKES,
"THIS BOY LYNDON JOHNSON ONE DAY
"CAN WIND UP BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
HE'S GOT IT."
THAT WAS QUITE A CALL, WASN'T IT?
McCullough:
IN THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY,
THEY SAID THAT LYNDON WAS BORN TO POLITICS.
HIS GRANDFATHER HAD RUN FOR STATE OFFICE
AND HIS FATHER, SAM EALY JOHNSON,
SERVED SIX TERMS IN THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE.
SAM WAS AN OLD-TIME REFORM POLITICIAN
WHO VOTED TO TAX BIG BUSINESS,
AND LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM, SUPPORTED THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY.
"I LOVED GOING WITH MY FATHER TO THE LEGISLATURE", LYNDON SAID.
"THE ONLY THING I LOVED MORE WAS GOING WITH HIM
"ON THE TRAIL DURING HIS CAMPAIGNS.
SOMETIMES I WISHED IT WOULD GO ON FOREVER."
Dallek:
THERE ARE STATE LEGISLATORS WHO REMEMBER LYNDON.
THEY SAID IT WAS UNCANNY HOW MUCH HE LOOKED LIKE HIS FATHER,
HOW MUCH HIS MANNERISMS WERE LIKE HIS FATHER'S
AND HOW THEY'D GRAB YOU BY THE LAPELS
AND PULL YOU TOWARD THEM, AND WERE VERY PHYSICAL
AND THERE WAS A KIND OF WARMTH TO IT,
A KIND OF VERY HUMAN QUALITY.
AND HE GOT THE SMELL IN HIS NOSE OF POLITICS
AND IT JUST ENTHRALLED HIM.
McCullough:
JOHNSON'S MOTHER, REBEKAH, WAS A COLLEGE GRADUATE,
CULTURED AND AMBITIOUS.
IT WAS SAID THAT LYNDON GOT HIS DRIVE AND AMBITION FROM HER.
NOTHING HAD PREPARED REBEKAH FOR THE HARDSHIPS
OF LIFE IN THE RURAL BACKWATERS OF TEXAS,
WITH NO ELECTRICITY OR INDOOR PLUMBING.
"LIFE IS REAL AND EARNEST," SHE WROTE,
"AND NOT THE CHARMING FAIRY TALE OF WHICH I HAD SO LONG DREAMED."
"THE FIRST YEAR OF HER MARRIAGE WAS THE WORST YEAR OF HER LIFE,"
JOHNSON LATER SAID.
"THEN I CAME ALONG, AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT AGAIN;
I COULD DO ALL THE THINGS SHE NEVER DID."
Woman:
THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPRESSION THAT WAS IN HER
WHICH COULD ONLY BE RELIEVED
BY PUTTING ALL OF HER HOPES AND AMBITIONS ON THIS CHILD.
HE WOULD TELL ME THAT WHEN HIS FATHER WAS AWAY
AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE, EVEN WHEN HE WAS 11 OR 12,
THAT HE WAS INVITED TO STAY IN HER BED AT NIGHT
TO KEEP HER COMPANY.
BUT THEN WHEN HE CAME HOME WITH A BAD REPORT CARD,
SHE WOULD LITERALLY WITHDRAW HER LOVE TO THE POINT WHERE,
HE TOLD ME,
THAT SHE WOULDN'T EVEN SPEAK TO HIM FOR DAYS ON END;
THAT SHE WOULD TALK TO HER HUSBAND OR THE OTHER CHILDREN
AND PRETEND HE DIDN'T EXIST.
SO THAT LACK OF CONSISTENT LOVE, I THINK, WAS WHAT MADE HIM FEEL
ALWAYS THAT ONLY WOULD HE BE LOVED IF HE PERFORMED.
McCullough:
FEAR OF FAILURE WOULD HAUNT HIM ALL OF HIS LIFE.
WHEN LYNDON WAS IN HIS TEENS, HE WATCHED HIS FATHER GO BROKE.
COTTON PRICES PLUMMETED.
SAM WAS FORCED TO SELL THE FAMILY FARM.
NEITHER LYNDON NOR HIS MOTHER
EVER WANTED HIM TO BE LIKE HIS FAILED FATHER,
AND IT FIRED HIS DRIVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
THE DAY LYNDON JOHNSON LEFT FOR WASHINGTON
TO TAKE HIS PLACE IN CONGRESS,
HE BID HIS PARENTS AN EMOTIONAL GOOD-BYE.
HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM HIS ELECTION WAS COMPENSATION
FOR HER OWN DISAPPOINTMENTS.
"YOU HAVE ALWAYS JUSTIFIED MY EXPECTATIONS,
"MY HOPES, MY DREAMS.
HOW DEAR TO ME YOU ARE YOU CANNOT KNOW, MY DARLING BOY."
JOHNSON NEVER FORGOT HIS FATHER'S PARTING WORDS:
"NOW, YOU GET UP THERE, SUPPORT F.D.R. ALL THE WAY,
NEVER SHIMMY, AND GIVE 'EM HELL."
LESS THAN SIX MONTHS LATER, HIS FATHER WAS DEAD.
♫NEW DEAL RHYTHM♫
♫NEW DEAL RHYTHM?
♫
♫NEW DEAL RHYTHM♫
♫WE'LL FIGHT, HIT BACK♫
♫FIGHT BACK, WAITING FOR THE NEW DEAL♫
♫READY FOR THE NEW DEAL♫
♫READY FOR THE NEW DEAL.♫
McCullough:
AS JOHNSON ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON,
THE EXCITEMENT AND PROMISE OF ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL
STILL ANIMATED THE CAPITAL.
THE NEW DEAL WAS THE PERFECT CLIMATE
FOR THE YOUNG CONGRESSMAN AND HIS WIFE, LADY BIRD.
HE HAD PROPOSED TO HER THE DAY THEY MET
AND SHE BECAME THE PERFECT POLITICAL WIFE:
RISING AT MIDNIGHT TO SCRAMBLE EGGS FOR HIS FRIENDS,
RUNNING HIS CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE,
WORKING AS HIS BUSINESS MANAGER.
LADY BIRD NEVER STOPPED SERVING HER HUSBAND'S AMBITIONS.
ASSIGNED A ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING
FAR FROM THE CORRIDORS OF POWER,
THE FRESHMAN CONGRESSMAN DIDN'T HESITATE
TO TURN TO THE PRESIDENT FOR HELP.
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, JOHNSON SECURED LOANS
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL GRANTS
FOR FARMERS, SCHOOLS, HOUSING FOR THE POOR,
ROADS, PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
BUT HELPING COMPLETE THE GREAT DAM ON THE LOWER COLORADO RIVER
WAS HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT
AND THE NEXT STEP IN THE EDUCATION OF LYNDON JOHNSON.
IN 1938, RURAL TEXANS WERE STILL LIVING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.
Man:
IT WAS A RATHER PRIMITIVE LIFE--
NO RUNNING WATER, AND THEY HAD NO REFRIGERATION.
EVERY MEAL HAD TO BE STARTED FROM SCRATCH.
THEY USED TO SAY THE MAN WAS A GENTLEMAN
WHO WOULD PROVIDE HIS WIFE WITH A SHARP AXE
TO CUT THE WOOD WITH.
McCullough:
"OF ALL THE THINGS I'VE EVER DONE,"
LYNDON JOHNSON LATER WROTE,
"NOTHING HAS EVER GIVEN ME AS MUCH SATISFACTION
AS BRINGING POWER TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF TEXAS."
MY DAUGHTER, WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT NINE YEARS OLD,
SHE JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW THE HOUSE HAD LIT UP.
SHE SAID, "MAMA, THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE."
McCullough:
THE DAM WAS EVERYTHING A YOUNG CONGRESSMAN
COULD HAVE HOPED FOR.
THE HILL COUNTRY FARMERS THANKED JOHNSON FOR THE ELECTRICITY
AND THE MEN WHO BUILT THE DAM THANKED HIM
FOR THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.
GEORGE AND HERMAN BROWN
OF THE BROWN AND ROOT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.
JOHNSON HELPED THE BROWN BROTHERS BUILD
A BILLION DOLLAR CONSTRUCTION EMPIRE.
IN TURN, THE BROWNS WOULD FUND JOHNSON'S POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS.
JUDGMENTALLY, WHAT I'D SAY IS THEY WERE A COUPLE OF GUYS
WHO WERE MAKING MONEY OUT OF THE NEW DEAL
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PAY HIGHER WAGE RATES,
SO THEY WERE AGAINST THE UNIONS.
IT WASN'T A MATTER OF HIGH PRINCIPLE;
THEY WANTED TO GET RICH, AND THEY DID GET RICH.
WELL, LYNDON SIDLED UP TO THEM, OR THEY SIDLED UP TO HIM,
AND THEY MADE BOOK.
I REMEMBER ASKING JOHNSON ONCE IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
"DID YOU DEAL WITH CASH?"
AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL CASH.
THERE WERE NO RECORDS.
SO, UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE WERE PLENTY OF POLITICIANS
WHO WERE SELLING OUT TO BUSINESS INTERESTS.
I USE A PEJORATIVE TERM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER TERM TO USE.
IN TV YOU HAVE TO USE SOME SHORTHAND.
THEY WERE AGREEING TO BE WITH THOSE PEOPLE
IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY WHICH THEY USED IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS.
THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO SELLING OUT, ISN'T IT?
AND EVERYTHING IS ORGANIZED-- NOT LIKE HIS FATHER
AROUND IDEAS AND IDEALS--
BUT LIKE THE SON, AROUND HIMSELF, AND HIS OWN CAREER.
NOT TO SAY THAT HE IS NOT THEREFORE DOING A LOT OF GOOD.
HE BRINGS REAL ELECTRICITY TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE IT
IN HIS OWN DISTRICT-- YEAH, SURE, HE'S REALLY SMART.
McCullough:
ON MAY 2, 1939,
GEORGE BROWN WROTE JOHNSON A LETTER.
"I HOPE YOU KNOW, LYNDON, HOW I FEEL
"IN REFERENCE TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME
"AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION THROUGH THE YEARS
WITH ACTIONS RATHER THAN WORDS."
TWO YEARS LATER, THE BROWN BROTHERS MADE GOOD
ON THEIR PROMISE.
( country music, men hooting )
IN 1941, WHEN JOHNSON MADE A RUN FOR THE SENATE,
HE NEEDED ALL THE MONEY THE BROWN BROTHERS COULD GIVE HIM.
HE WAS JUST A YOUNG CONGRESSMAN
REACHING BEYOND HIS OWN SMALL DISTRICT
IN A RACE THAT WAS PURE TEXAS POLITICS--
PART CAMPAIGN AND PART CIRCUS.
29 CANDIDATES TOOK THE FIELD,
BUT IN THE END, THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN TO BEAT:
THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, PAPPY LEE O'DANIEL.
Man:
WELL, PAPPY O'DANIEL WAS A MAN WHO'D COME OUT OF NOWHERE
TO BE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS IN THE LATE '30s.
HE WAS A RADIO PERSONALITY, THAT'S WHAT MADE HIM SO POPULAR.
HE HAD A BAND THAT PLAYED FOR HIM
CALLED THE LIGHT CRUST DOUGHBOYS
AND THEIR THEME SONG WAS "PASS THE BISCUITS, PAPPY."
AND HE BECAME KNOWN AS
W. LEE "PASS THE BISCUITS, PAPPY" O'DANIEL.
♫AND I SAID, "SKEDOODLE, OL' HARD TIME BLUES"♫
Gould:
HE WAS CONSERVATIVE,
BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN ANYTHING
EXCEPT GETTING ELECTED AND BEING POPULAR.
♫AND I GOT THAT MILLION-DOLLAR SMILE.♫
HE HAD BEEN ON RADIO FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
WITH A VERY POPULAR PROGRAM OF COUNTRY MUSIC.
EVERY DAY AT NOON HE HAD HIS TEXAS NETWORK
AND HE PLAYED AND HE SANG
AND THE LADIES JUST WORSHIPPED HIM, YOU KNOW.
YOU COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY WHO VOTED FOR HIM,
BUT HE ALWAYS WON THE ELECTIONS.
♫...
PLAYED BY THE REAL HILLBILLY BAND.♫
"NOW, LISTEN, EVERYBODY, FROM NEAR AND FAR,
WE'RE THE LIGHT CRUST DOUGH BOYS."
AND THEN HE WOULD SING "BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL TEXAS"
♫WHERE THE BEAUTIFUL BLUEBONNETS GROW♫
♫WE'RE PROUD OF OUR FOREFATHERS♫
♫WHO FOUGHT AT THE ALAMO.♫
♫YOU CAN LIVE ON THE PLAINS OR THE MOUNTAIN♫
♫OR DOWN WHERE THE SEA BREEZES BLOW♫
♫AND YOU'RE STILL IN BEAUTIFUL TEXAS♫
♫THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STATE THAT WE KNOW.♫
♫OH, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL TEXAS♫
♫WHERE THE BEAUTIFUL BLUEBONNETS GROW.♫
Man:
AND HERE WAS JOHNSON, AN UNKNOWN YOUNG CONGRESSMAN, SO TO SPEAK,
BUT HE ALSO HAD THE AURA THAT HE WAS GOING SOMEWHERE.
HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU COULD FEEL IT.
AND HE WOULD HAVE FUN
BUT HE WAS ALL BUSINESS OF DREAMING, AND DARING,
IMAGINING, ATTEMPTING NEW THINGS.
♫THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STATE THAT WE KNOW.♫
Dallek:
THERE WAS NOBODY WHO CAMPAIGNED HARDER THAN A LYNDON JOHNSON.
HE WORKED NIGHT AND DAY, SPEAKING, WALKING, DRIVING--
JUST DOING EVERYTHING HE CONCEIVABLY COULD
TO GET HIS NAME BEFORE THE PUBLIC AND CONVINCE THEM
OF THE FACT THAT HE WOULD MAKE A FIRST-CLASS SENATOR.
Johnson:
I BELIEVE THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE FED UP
ON HIRED HANDS DOING NOTHING BUT ENTERTAINING YOU.
YOU ARE GOING TO SEND LYNDON JOHNSON
TO THE SENATE NEXT SATURDAY
BY THE GREATEST VOTE THAT YOU EVER SENT A SENATOR THERE.
( cheering )
Lady Bird:
HE WENT TO EVERY SMALL HAMLET, WALKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET,
SHOOK HANDS WITH ALL THE MERCHANTS.
HE WOULD LINE UP ALL THE FRIENDS
THAT ALL YOUR FRIENDS COULD SUMMONS,
AND YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR KINFOLKS.
♫IN BEAUTIFUL TEXAS, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STATE THAT WE KNOW.♫
McCullough:
AS THE CAMPAIGN DREW TO A CLOSE, JOHNSON REMAINED THE UNDERDOG,
BUT ONCE AGAIN, BY LIFTING HIGH THE ROOSEVELT BANNER,
JOHNSON CLOSED THE GAP.
ON ELECTION NIGHT, HE WAS CONFIDENT.
WITH 96% OF THE VOTE COUNTED, HE LED O'DANIEL BY 5,000 VOTES.
CONGRATULATIONS WERE ALREADY POURING IN FROM WASHINGTON.
Lady Bird:
WE HAD BEEN DECLARED ELECTED BY THE TEXAS ELECTION BUREAU
ON SATURDAY NIGHT, WHEN THE VOTES WERE COUNTED.
BANNER HEADLINES ON SUNDAY MORNING:
"JOHNSON ELECTED TO SENATE."
Pickle:
THE DALLAS NEWS,
THE GREAT DALLAS NEWS, RAN A STORY ON SUNDAY MORNING
"L.B.J., JOHNSON, UNITED STATES SENATOR."
THEY DECLARED HIM ELECTED, ABOUT LIKE THEY HAD DONE IT FOR DEWEY.
BUT THE MARGIN BY WHICH WE WERE ELECTED BEGAN TO DWINDLE.
IT WAS ABOUT 5,000 TO BEGIN WITH.
AND IT BEGAN TO DWINDLE.
McCullough:
THE 33-YEAR-OLD CONTENDER WAS ABOUT TO GET A LESSON
IN THE DARK SIDE OF POLITICS THAT HE WOULD NEVER FORGET.
IN THE ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE WORLD OF TEXAS ELECTIONS,
STUFFING THE BALLOT BOX WAS NOT UNUSUAL,
ESPECIALLY IN SOUTH AND EAST TEXAS.
AND NO ONE UNDERSTOOD THIS MORE THAN JOHN CONNALLY,
LYNDON JOHNSON'S FRIEND AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
Connally:
A LOT OF THOSE COUNTIES HAD POLITICAL LEADERS--
SOMETIMES IT WAS A SHERIFF, SOMETIMES A COUNTY JUDGE.
THEY HAD BASICALLY CARRIED THE COUNTY THE WAY THEY WANTED IT
TO GO AND THIS HAD BEEN HISTORICALLY THE CASE
AND WE HAD THE SUPPORT OF MOST OF THOSE POLITICAL LEADERS.
SATURDAY NIGHT ABOUT MIDNIGHT
THEY CALLED ME AND SAID, "WE'VE GOT THE RETURNS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO WITH THEM?"
I SAID, "WELL, TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE, FIRST,
AND THEN REPORT THEM."
THE OPPOSITION THEN, GOVERNOR O'DANIEL AND HIS PEOPLE,
KNEW EXACTLY HOW MANY VOTES THEY HAD TO HAVE TO TAKE THE LEAD.
THEY KEPT CHANGING THE RESULTS, CHANGING THE RETURNS
AND OUR LEAD GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER.
FINALLY, WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WE WOUND UP
ON THE SHORT SIDE OF THE STICK
AND LOST THE ELECTION BY 1,311 VOTES.
AND I'M BASICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSING THAT '41 CAMPAIGN.
WE LET THEM KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY VOTES THEY HAD TO HAVE.
AND I DID IT-- NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
♫OH, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL TEXAS...♫
Pickle:
IT WAS A HARD PILL FOR MR. JOHNSON TO SWALLOW
BECAUSE WE'D GONE OUT LATE SATURDAY TO CELEBRATE.
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN OTHER CAMPAIGNS.
I ALWAYS WAITED TILL THE NEXT DAY.
LYNDON WAS ASKED, DOES HE WANT TO CHALLENGE PAPPY'S VICTORY,
BECAUSE IT IS A STOLEN ELECTION,
BUT LYNDON KNOWS THAT HIS OWN FOLKS AND SUPPORTERS
HAVE DONE SOME PRETTY UNTOWARD THINGS AS WELL,
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THEY VIOLATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS
AND SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,
AND JOHNSON SAYS, "NO, WE CAN'T CHALLENGE THEM.
"I'LL WAIT MY TURN, AND WHEN MY TURN COMES
I'LL FIX THE BALANCE NEXT TIME."
WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE BETTER PART OF WISDOM
NOT TO CONTEST IT,
NOT INDICATE THAT WE WERE GUILTY OF JUST SOUR GRAPES
AND GO AHEAD AND SAY, "WE'LL MEET AGAIN."
McCullough:
JOHNSON WAS NOT PREPARED FOR DEFEAT,
AND HE WAS NEVER MORE MISERABLE.
"I FELT TERRIBLY REJECTED
"AND I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT LEAVING POLITICS
AND GOING HOME TO MAKE MONEY," HE SAID.
BUT HE COULDN'T BRING HIMSELF TO QUIT.
HE BOUGHT A HOUSE, AND ESTABLISHED THE BASIS
FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL FORTUNE.
LADY BIRD BOUGHT A SMALL AUSTIN RADIO STATION.
AFTER NEARLY 10 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
THEIR FIRST DAUGHTER WAS BORN.
THREE YEARS LATER, THEY WOULD HAVE ANOTHER GIRL.
BUT POLITICALLY, JOHNSON LANGUISHED.
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS TOO SMALL A STAGE.
ALONG WITH SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN, HE VOTED AGAINST CIVIL RIGHTS
AND TOLD HIS LIBERAL FRIENDS,
YOU CAN'T BE A STATESMAN IF YOU DON'T GET ELECTED.
FINALLY, AFTER SEVEN RESTLESS YEARS,
JOHNSON SEIZED A CHANCE TO RUN FOR THE SENATE.
IT WOULD BE A CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD HAUNT HIM
FOR THE REST OF HIS POLITICAL LIFE.
Lady Bird:
AND THIS TIME
HIS OPPONENT WAS COKE STEVENSON, ALSO A GOVERNOR,
AND A VERY FORMIDABLE MAN.
McCullough:
COKE STEVENSON WAS A SELF-MADE MAN,
TIGHTFISTED WITH THE BUDGET, AND IMMENSELY POPULAR.
HIS MOST ARDENT ADMIRERS CALLED HIM "MR. TEXAS."
Connally:
THE POLLS CLEARLY SHOWED THAT COKE STEVENSON STARTING OUT
HAD ALMOST A TWO-TO-ONE LEAD OVER JOHNSON.
IT WAS AN ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD
AND MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT JOHNSON COULDN'T WIN IT.
HE TOLD US, AND JOHN CONNALLY TOLD US,
AND ANYBODY THAT HAD BEEN TO A COUNTY FAIR AND A GOAT-ROPING
AND KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT TEXAS POLITICS
KNEW THIS WAS MAKE OR BREAK FOR LYNDON JOHNSON.
( country music )
Dallek:
BY 1948, JOHNSON HAD BECOME A MASTER OF TEXAS POLITICS.
♫LET SAN ANTONIO ROLL!
♫
Dallek:
THEY'D RUN THESE SHOWS, THESE EXTRAVAGANZAS,
IN THESE SMALL TOWNS
AND THE BAND AND THE MUSIC, AND MAYBE GIVING A SAVINGS BOND
OR A BARBECUE, BEER, OR SOME KIND OF WATERMELONS
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THIS WAS ALL PART OF A TRADITIONAL TEXAS HOOPLA
AND JOHNSON DIDN'T MISS A BEAT THERE.
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF IT.
McCullough:
MEANWHILE, COKE STEVENSON WAS SO POPULAR AND SO WELL KNOWN
THAT HE CAMPAIGNED FROM SMALL TOWN TO SMALL TOWN
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
BUT NOT LYNDON JOHNSON.
IN A HEADLONG FIVE-WEEK HELICOPTER CAMPAIGN,
JOHNSON CRISSCROSSED THE STATE, MADE 370 LANDINGS
AND LOST 27 POUNDS.
IN ONE DAY ALONE, HE SPOKE TO 15,000 PEOPLE.
Pickle:
AND I TELL YOU, IF YOU'D GO INTO A LITTLE TOWN AND SAY,
"LYNDON JOHNSON'S COMING TO TOWN, AND HE'LL BE HERE AT 2:00
AND HE'LL LAND ON HIS HELICOPTER."
EVERYBODY IN TOWN WANTED TO SEE THAT.
THEY'D KIND OF LAUGH ABOUT IT, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT.
McCullough:
THEY CALLED HIM "THE JOHNSON CITY WINDMILL."
TEXANS NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT.
Pickle:
IT WAS DRAMATIC.
CAN YOU IMAGINE A LITTLE SMALL TOWN
THAT NEVER HAD A HELICOPTER COME, OR NEVER SEEN ONE MUCH?
NO TELEVISION THOSE DAYS, YOU SEE.
THEY'D FLY IN OVER A LITTLE TOWN AND CIRCLE A COUPLE TIMES,
AND HE'D GET ON THE P.A. SYSTEM AND SAY, "THIS IS LYNDON JOHNSON
"AND I'M GOING TO LAND IN JUST A MINUTE
AND I WANT TO SHAKE EVERY HAND DOWN THERE."
PEOPLE LOOK UP THERE, THEY KIND OF LAUGH AND GIGGLE,
BUT THEIR MOUTH WOULD BE OPEN
AND THEY'D SAY, "IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?"
Woman:
HE WOULD SAY, "THIS IS LYNDON JOHNSON, YOUR CONGRESSMAN.
HOW DO YOU THINK THINGS ARE RUNNING?"
"ALL RIGHT, ED, WHAT ABOUT THAT CROP OUT THERE?
DO YOU HAVE A GOOD CROP THIS YEAR?
HE'D COME OVER HERE
AND CALL ONE'S NAME.
"WELL, ALL RIGHT, SID HYDE.
HOW'S THE CATTLE BUSINESS DOING TODAY?"
"OLIN, HOW'S THE CAR BUSINESS COMING ON?"
OLD OLIN JUMPED AND LOOKED AROUND.
HE WASN'T EXPECTING THAT TO BE CALLED OUT.
Pickle:
WHEN HE'D LAND, HE'D BANK THE HELICOPTER OVER
AND HE'D CIRCLE AROUND OVER THE FIELD
AND THROW HIS STETSON HAT OUT OVER THE CROWD.
NOW, THAT WAS DRAMATIC.
AND HE HAD ABOUT A FOUR-BEAVER HAT, A GOOD ONE.
AND WHEN HE DID IT,
THOSE OF US ON THE GROUND WHO WERE PART OF THE CREW--
OUR JOB WAS TO GO GET THAT HAT.
WE HAD TO RECLAIM THAT HAT.
AND IF WE DIDN'T GET IT,
WE'D CATCH "HAIL COLUMBIA" FROM THE BOSS THEN.
AND HE'D SAY, "DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT HAT COST ME?
HAVE YOU BEEN IN TO BUY A STETSON HAT LATELY?"
AND WE'D SAY NO, OF COURSE, WE WOULDN'T DARE WEAR
A HAT LIKE THAT.
HE SAID, "THAT'S COMING OUT OF MY POCKET.
YOU GET THAT HAT WHEN WE THROW IT OUT."
AND WE'D HAVE TO GO GET THAT HAT.
USUALLY WE COULD GET IT,
BUT IF YOU GOT IT RECOVERED BY A LITTLE TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY,
IT'D BE PRETTY HARD TO RUN UP AND SAY,
"SON, GIVE ME THAT HAT," AND TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM.
SO IT WASN'T ALWAYS PLEASANT.
McCullough:
JOHNSON HAD BEGUN HIS POLITICAL LIFE
AS A FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT LIBERAL,
BUT IN 1948, HE RAN AGAINST THE UNIONS,
SUPPORTED BIG BUSINESS
AND SPOKE OUT STRONGLY AGAINST CIVIL RIGHTS.
THE OIL BOOM HAD MADE TEXAS WEALTHY AND CONSERVATIVE
AND AS TEXAS CHANGED, SO HAD LYNDON JOHNSON.
Dugger:
WELL, YOU HAVE AN AUTHENTIC CONSERVATIVE, STEVENSON,
RUNNING AGAINST A NEW DEAL LIBERAL, JOHNSON,
WHO HAS CONCEALED HIS COLORS.
LYNDON PRESENTED HIMSELF AS MORE ANTI-UNION THAN COKE STEVENSON.
WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE IN TERMS OF WHO LYNDON REALLY WAS?
NONE.
THERE'S NO SENSE TO IT EXCEPT,
OR COURSE, THE ABSOLUTELY UNQUALIFIED OPPORTUNISM
OF A SUCCESSFUL POLITICIAN OF THIS PARTICULAR MOLD.
HE OUT-RIGHTED THE MOST CONSERVATIVE FIGURE
IN TEXAS POLITICS AT THAT TIME.
Dallek:
SOME PEOPLE HAVE TENDED TO IDEALIZE COKE STEVENSON
AND SEE HIM AS A KIND OF OLD-FASHIONED TEXAS COWBOY
AND MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY.
IN FACT, COKE STEVENSON WAS A TERRIBLY REACTIONARY MAN.
FIRST OF ALL, ON CIVIL RIGHTS--
IN 1942, A BLACK TEXAN WAS LYNCHED IN TEXARKANA
AND STEVENSON GAVE VERY LITTLE PUBLIC RESPONSE AGAINST THIS.
AND WHEN HE WAS ASKED PRIVATELY ABOUT IT
HIS COMMENT WAS, "YOU KNOW," HE SAID,
"THESE NEGROES SOMETIMES DO THINGS
WHICH PROVOKE WHITES TO SUCH VIOLENCE."
AND WHEN THE 1944 SUPREME COURT DECISION WAS HANDED DOWN
ASSERTING THAT BLACKS HAD THE RIGHT
TO VOTE IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES,
STEVENSON CALLED IT "A THREAT TO OUR SECURITY AND SAFETY."
HE WAS FIERCELY ANTI-CIVIL RIGHTS
AND A RACIST AND A SEGREGATIONIST
OF THE FIRST ORDER.
McCullough:
THE RACE WAS SO CLOSE, THERE WAS NO WAY TO CALL IT.
THE LEAD SEESAWED BACK AND FORTH.
Connally:
I SAID, "I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WIN IT."
HE SAID, "NO, I THINK WE'VE LOST IT."
AND I SAID, "NO, IT'S GOING TO BE THE REVERSAL OF 1941."
McCullough:
THREE DAYS AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED,
THE VOTES WERE STILL COMING IN, AND STEVENSON LED BY A HANDFUL.
IT LOOKED AS IF STEVENSON WOULD BE THE NEW SENATOR FROM TEXAS.
BUT JOHNSON REMEMBERED 1941.
HE WAS NOT ABOUT TO LOSE AGAIN.
THE ELECTION NOW HINGED ON THE "DUKE OF DUVAL COUNTY,"
GEORGE PAAR, THE MAN WHO CONTROLLED THE VOTES
IN SOUTH TEXAS.
Connally:
GEORGE PAAR CONTROLLED THAT COUNTY
AND THOSE PEOPLE VOTED THE WAY HE WANTED THEM TO VOTE.
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT, NONE WHATEVER.
NOW, THE CANDIDATES HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS, YOU DON'T WRITE DOWN,
"BOUGHT THESE VOTES YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:00."
BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS SOME UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THE JOHNSON PEOPLE
AND THE POLITICAL BOSSES IN SOUTH TEXAS.
Dallek:
EARLIER, WHEN COKE STEVENSON RAN FOR GOVERNOR,
HE ALSO HAD ALSO BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF THE FAVOR
OF THE BOSSES BECAUSE HE HAD PAID THEM.
IN ONE OF HIS RACES, GEORGE PAAR,
THE "DUKE OF DUVAL COUNTY,"
HAD GIVEN STEVENSON A VOTE OF 3,310 TO 17.
IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT SUCH A LOPSIDED MARGIN
WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ANY CANDIDATE FOR ANY OFFICE?
McCullough:
IN THE TINY SOUTH TEXAS TOWN OF ALICE,
SIX DAYS AFTER THE POLLS HAD CLOSED, 202 ADDITIONAL VOTES WERE REPORTED FROM PRECINCT BOX 13.
WHEN THEY WERE COUNTED, ALL BUT TWO WERE FOR LYNDON JOHNSON.
WHEN THE SIGNATURES OF THE 202 NEW VOTERS WERE EXAMINED,
SOME SAY THE NAMES WERE ALL WRITTEN IN THE SAME INK
AND LISTED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER.
I DID NOT NOTICE THAT THEY WERE IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER,
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE PEOPLE TESTIFIED LATER
THAT THAT HAD HAPPENED.
McCullough:
HOMER DEAN WAS A 29-YEAR-OLD ATTORNEY
WORKING IN THE JOHNSON CAMPAIGN
WHEN COKE STEVENSON ARRIVED IN ALICE AND DEMANDED
TO SEE THE VOTING LIST LOCKED IN THE VAULT
OF THE TEXAS STATE BANK.
DEAN IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
WHO ACTUALLY SAW THE DISPUTED NAMES.
Dean:
IT LOOKED LIKE THERE HAD BEEN A CHANGE IN INK
AND IT LOOKED LIKE 200 OR 202 OR THREE NAMES HAD BEEN ADDED
TO THE POLL LIST IN A DIFFERENT INK
BY A DIFFERENT HAND.
MR. STEVENSON WAS AN OUTRAGED MAN
THAT FELT LIKE THE ELECTION HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM,
AND HE FELT LIKE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN WAS EVIDENCE OF THAT.
McCullough:
STEVENSON CHALLENGED THE ELECTION
AT THE TEXAS STATE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION;
IT WAS NO USE.
THE JOHNSON FORCES WERE TOO POWERFUL.
WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER,
PRECINCT BOX NUMBER 13 MADE THE DIFFERENCE.
JOHNSON WON BY 87 VOTES.
BUT THE QUESTION OF A STOLEN ELECTION REMAINED.
Dugger:
YOU CANNOT MAKE THE STATEMENT ON THE FACTS
THAT JOHNSON STOLE THE ELECTION.
I THINK YOU CAN SAY IT WAS STOLEN FOR HIM.
THAT'S TRUE, BUT DID HE ORDER IT DONE?
I NEVER COULD FIND JOHN CONNALLY DOWN THERE DOING IT.
I WASN'T WITHIN 200 MILES OF HIM.
I WAS IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, ON A BATTERY OF TELEPHONES
CALLING ALL OVER THE STATE OF TEXAS.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH ABOUT IT.
IF HOMER DEAN KNEW IT WAS STOLEN,
YOU DON'T FIND HOMER DEAN SAYING HE STOLE IT.
I DIDN'T THEN, AND DON'T NOW, THINK THAT JOHNSON
DIRECTLY PARTICIPATED IN IT.
HE RECEIVED THE BENEFIT OF IT, BUT I DON'T THINK
HE DIRECTED IT OR EVEN KNEW ABOUT IT WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING.
YOU SEE, IT JUST GETS AWAY FROM YOU.
McCullough:
19 YEARS LATER, RONNIE DUGGER MET IN THE WHITE HOUSE
WITH PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON AND ASKED HIM
ABOUT THE ELECTION OF 1948.
Dugger:
ONE NIGHT, UP IN HIS BEDROOM,
HE STARTED LAUGHING AND...
SEEMED TO...
I WONDERED IF HE COULD FIND SOMETHING
AND HE SAID HE WAS GOING BACK INTO BIRD'S BEDROOM NEXT DOOR.
AND HE RUMMAGED AROUND IN A CLOSET--
I THINK I COULD HEAR HIM RUMMAGING AROUND IN A CLOSET--
AND HE CAME IN WITH THIS PHOTOGRAPH OF THESE FIVE GUYS
IN FRONT OF THIS OLD CAR
WITH BOX 13 BALANCED ON THE HOOD OF IT.
I LOOKED AT HIM AND GRINNED.
HE GRINNED BACK.
BUT HE WOULDN'T EXPLAIN IT TO ME.
I ASKED HIM, WELL, WHO WERE THESE GUYS?
WHY DID THEY HAVE BOX 13 ON THE HOOD OF THIS CAR?
WHAT DID IT MEAN?
AND HE JUST...
NOTHING.
HE WOULDN'T SAY.
AS WE'D SAY IN TEXAS, "HE WOULDN'T SAY NOTHING."
SO THERE IT IS-
- HISTORY TURNING ON A...
A MYSTERY.
McCullough:
IT WAS 1949, AND TEXAS HAD A NEW FRESHMAN SENATOR.
THEY CALLED HIM "LANDSLIDE LYNDON."
Gould:
IT CAST A SHADOW OF ILLEGITIMACY
OVER THE REST OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER
THAT HE NEVER ESCAPED.
THE IDEA OF "LANDSLIDE LYNDON," 87 VOTES,
THAT THERE WERE SKELETONS IN HIS CLOSET,
THAT HE WAS A WHEELER-DEALER, THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING
KIND OF FLAWED ABOUT HIS TITLE, BOTH TO BEING SENATOR
AND TO BEING PRESIDENT.
McCullough:
WHEN AN EXUBERANT JOHNSON ENTERED THE SENATE,
HE WAS A POWERLESS FRESHMAN JOINING A SELECT CLUB
RUN BY INSIDERS VERY MUCH HIS SENIOR.
HE TURNED FOR HELP TO A MAN WHO KNEW JUST HOW THE CLUB WAS RUN:
BOBBY BAKER.
BAKER HAD COME TO THE SENATE
AS A TEEN-AGE PAGE IN THE 1940s
AND KNEW, EVERYONE SAID, "WHERE THE BODIES WERE BURIED."
Baker:
AND SO HE SAID, "MR. BAKER, I WANTED TO MEET YOU.
"MY SPIES TELL ME YOU'RE THE SMARTEST
SON OF A BITCH OVER THERE."
I SAID, "THAT'S NOT TRUE.
"THE ONLY REPUTATION I HAVE IS THAT MY WORD IS MY BOND
AND I'LL PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY."
HE SAID, "WELL, YOU'RE THE KIND OF MAN I WANT TO KNOW."
SO HE SAID, "I WANT YOU TO KNOW
"THAT THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
IS MUCH MORE LIBERAL THAN TEXAS."
HE ADVISED ME IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT HE WAS COMMITTED
TO THE OIL INTEREST IN TEXAS.
McCullough:
JOHNSON ALWAYS KNEW WHERE THE POWER WAS.
IN TEXAS, HE COZIED UP TO THE OIL BARONS.
IN THE SENATE, HE ATTACHED HIMSELF
TO THE SOUTHERN CONSERVATIVES AND THEIR INFLUENTIAL LEADER,
RICHARD BREVARD RUSSELL OF GEORGIA.
Baker:
SENATOR RUSSELL WAS A LONELY BACHELOR.
HE READ PROBABLY TEN BOOKS A WEEK.
HE WAS A LONER.
BUT LYNDON JOHNSON AT THIS TIME KNEW WHERE THE POWER WAS.
HAD SENATOR RUSSELL BEEN A WOMAN HE WOULD HAVE MARRIED HIM,
BECAUSE, UH...
OR MARRIED HER.
McCullough:
UNDER RUSSELL'S PATRONAGE,
JOHNSON WAS GIVEN THE JOB OF PARTY WHIP.
HE TRANSFORMED WHAT HAD BEEN A MINOR POST INTO A SEAT OF POWER.
TWO YEARS LATER, HE WAS ELECTED DEMOCRATIC LEADER.
"LANDSLIDE LYNDON" WAS NOW ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
IN HIS THIRD YEAR IN THE SENATE, JOHNSON HAD BOUGHT HIMSELF
A PIECE OF LAND ALONG THE PEDERNALES RIVER.
THE CONSUMMATE WASHINGTON POLITICIAN
SOON TOOK ON THE TRAPPINGS OF THE MYTHICAL TEXAS RANCHER.
BUT HE NEVER STOPPED WORKING.
THE L.B.J. RANCH WAS MORE THAN A PLACE OF RELAXATION;
IT BECAME PART OF THE STUFF OF POWER.
Connally:
HE HAD NO INTERESTS, REALLY, EXCEPT POLITICS.
THAT WAS HIS WHOLE LIFE.
HE WAS TOTALLY COMMITTED TO IT.
HE NEVER READ ANYTHING EXCEPT POLITICS.
HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANY SPORTS, HE DIDN'T READ ANY BOOKS.
I DON'T KNOW OF ONE BOOK HE READ
IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE KNOWN HIM.
Kearns:
I THINK FOR LYNDON JOHNSON'S TEMPERAMENT,
THE SENATE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECTLY SUITED.
FOR ONE THING, IT WAS A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE.
YOU'VE ONLY GOT A LIMITED NUMBER,
ALL OF WHOM CAN BE SUBJECT TO HIS PERSONALITY.
HE COULD GET UP EVERY DAY AND LEARN WHAT THEIR FEARS,
THEIR DESIRES, THEIR WISHES, THEIR WANTS WERE,
AND HE COULD THEN MANIPULATE, DOMINATE, PERSUADE, CAJOLE THEM.
AND WHAT REALLY MADE THINGS WORK IN THE SENATE
WAS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,
AND JOHNSON WAS JUST STRICTLY THE BEST AT THAT.
Dugger:
HE WAS DETERMINED
TO RECRUIT YOU OR KILL YOU.
THEY USED TO CALL IT "THE JOHNSON TREATMENT."
Reedy:
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE BLEND OF BADGERING, CAJOLERY,
REMINDERS OF PAST FAVORS, PROMISES OF FUTURE FAVORS,
PREDICTIONS OF GLOOM IF SOMETHING DOESN'T HAPPEN.
WHEN THAT MAN STARTED TO WORK ON YOU,
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU JUST FELT
THAT YOU WERE STANDING UNDER A WATERFALL
AND THIS STUFF WAS POURING ON YOU.
I'VE SEEN HIM...
HE USED TO GET HIS...
HE WOULD SIT IN FRONT OF A SENATOR FACE-TO-FACE
AND THEN HE WOULD TAKE HIS HEAD
AND GET IT UNDERNEATH AND GO UP LIKE THIS
AND TALK TO HIM.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MAN.
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE NOT FROM THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY,
BUT IF YOU CAN'T EYEBALL A FELLOW
AND YOU CAN'T LOOK HIM IN THE FACE AND TALK TO HIM,
YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.
Newscaster:
THE 1954 MID-TERM ELECTION WILL GO DOWN
AS ONE OF THE MOST PECULIAR ON RECORD.
McCullough:
IN 1954,
WITH THE REPUBLICANS IN CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE,
THE DEMOCRATS GAINED CONTROL OF THE SENATE,
MAKING LYNDON JOHNSON THE YOUNGEST MAJORITY LEADER EVER.
HE WAS 46 YEARS OLD.
Dallek:
THERE WAS NO MORE POWERFUL MAJORITY LEADER
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
HE UNDERSTOOD THE WAY THE SENATE WORKED.
HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT SENATORS NEEDED AND WANTED.
HE HAD BIOGRAPHIES ON EACH OF THEM
SO HE KNEW WHAT THEIR TASTES AND INTENTIONS
AND AIMS AND DESIRES AND WISHES AND HOPES WERE.
HE KNEW THE WOMANIZERS, HE KNEW THE DRUNKS,
HE KNEW PEOPLE WHO WANTED WHAT COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.
HE KNEW WHAT ROOMS THEY WANTED.
HE KNEW IF THEY WANTED A TRIP TO EUROPE AND TAKE THEIR WIFE.
IF WE HAD A VOTE COMING UP
AND THE SENATOR COULDN'T VOTE WITH US
BUT WE COULD SEND HIM ON A NATO TRIP, WE WOULD DO THAT,
SO...
WHEREBY HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST US.
BUT HE WOULD BE OFF AND HIS WIFE WOULD BE HAPPY
AND HE'D BE ATTENDING A CONFERENCE.
AND THOSE CONFERENCES ARE VERY IMPORTANT.
HIS SUBORDINATE, BOBBY BAKER, WHO WAS THE FLOOR MAN FOR HIM,
AND PEOPLE CALLED "LITTLE LYNDON,"
SAID ONE TIME,
"I HAVE TEN SENATORS IN THE PALM OF MY HAND."
IT'S A "GOOD OL' BOY" NETWORK.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'VE BEEN...
SERVED IN THE CONGRESS,
EITHER THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS,
YOU'VE DONE FAVORS FOR EACH OTHER
AND YOU SAY WHAT YOU CAN DO, CAN'T DO, AND WHAT'S POSSIBLE.
AND THEY CONTROLLED ALL THE...
WHAT I CALL BOODLE--
THE THINGS THAT WERE GIVEN TO PEOPLE.
EVERY SENATOR WANTS A PRIVATE OFFICE IN THE CAPITOL
BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE HIDEAWAY;
THEY COULD GET AWAY FROM THE PRESS.
THEY CAN GET AWAY FROM THEIR WIFE.
THEY CAN HAVE PRIVATE LUNCHES;
THEY CAN GO GET DRUNK.
THEY CAN BE A HUMAN BEING.
Shuman:
WHEN HE RAN THE SENATE-- INCREDIBLE WHAT HE WOULD DO.
I SAW HIM AT ONE TIME HOLD UP A ROLL CALL VOTE,
WHICH USUALLY TAKES 15 TO 20 MINUTES.
HE HELD IT UP FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR
SO THEY COULD EXTRACT HUBERT HUMPHREY
FROM OUT OF THE AIR OVER THE NATIONAL AIRPORT
AND THEY FINALLY BROUGHT HIM IN AND VOTED.
AND DURING THIS TIME,
JOHNSON WOULD BE GOING LIKE THIS TO THE CLERK,
TELLING HIM TO SLOW DOWN AS HE CALLED THE ROLL.
AND THEN THERE WERE OTHER TIMES WHEN HE HAD THE VOTES
AND HE WAS WINNING BY MAYBE ONE OR TWO VOTES
AND HE'D TELL HIM TO SPEED IT UP.
Man:
IN THE SENATE, HE WOULD PACE THE FLOOR,
PULL OUT HIS INHALER, DRAW A DEEP BREATH INTO HIS NOSE,
LOOKING AROUND THE CHAMBER, THINKING ALL THE TIME, NERVOUS.
HE NEVER SAT IN A CHAIR.
HE'D STAND UP AND JITTER.
HE'D BOUNCE UP AND DOWN,
RATTLING SILVER DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET.
Connally:
HE ATE IN A HURRY.
HE WOLFED HIS FOOD.
MOST OF THE TIME HE HAD NO MANNERS.
HE'D EAT OFF OF THE PLATE
OF EITHER PERSON ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM.
IF HE ATE SOMETHING THAT HE LIKED
AND THEY HADN'T FINISHED THEIRS,
HE'D REACH OVER WITH HIS FORK AND EAT OFF OF THEIR PLATE.
HE WOULD EAT HIS DESSERT, LADY BIRD'S, LYNDA'S--
HIS DAUGHTER'S-
- AND MINE, TOO.
I'M TELLING YOU, HE WAS A BIG MAN,
BUT HE COULD HANDLE TWO FIFTHS OF CUTTY SARK EVERY NIGHT
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.
THEN HE USED TO SMOKE CIGARETTES LIKE A CRAZY MAN...
TILL HE HAD HIS HEART ATTACK.
Johnson:
I'M GOING HOME TO GET A LONG REST
AND IF THE DOCTORS GIVE ME THE OKAY,
I'LL BE BACK ON THE JOB IN THE SENATE
WHEN THE SENATE RECONVENES IN JANUARY.
Reporter:
IN THE MEANTIME, NO POLITICS
AND ONTO THE ROCKING CHAIR?
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY
THAT YOU COULD TAKE POLITICS COMPLETELY AWAY FROM ME,
BUT WE'LL HAVE IT AT A MINIMUM.
Reporter:
GOOD LUCK.
McCullough:
JOHNSON HAD VERY NEARLY DIED.
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,
THE IMAGE OF A SUDDEN DEATH HUNG OVER HIM.
Reedy:
ONE OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S REAL TROUBLES
WAS HE WAS INCAPABLE OF RELAXATION.
EVEN WHEN HE TRIED TO RELAX, IT BECAME TERRIBLY FRENETIC.
Connally:
HE USED TO CALL ME ON SATURDAY MORNINGS
AND SAY, "LET'S GO TO THE GAME.
I'VE GOT SOME TICKETS."
WE'D SIT THERE DURING THE WHOLE BALL GAME AND TALK POLITICS.
HE DIDN'T WATCH THE FOOTBALL GAME--
LITERALLY DIDN'T WATCH IT.
HE WAS WATCHING THE CROWD, HE WAS LOOKING AROUND,
WAVING TO THIS ONE, WAVING TO THAT ONE.
Shuman:
BUT JOHNSON HAD AN IMMENSE EGO.
HE HAD ON HIS SHIRTS AND ON HIS SLEEVES HIS INITIALS:
L.B.J.
HIS WIFE'S NAME WAS LADY BIRD, AT LEAST INFORMALLY,
SO HER NAME WOULD BE L.B.J.
HIS TWO CHILDREN, HIS GIRLS, WERE BOTH L.B.J.
HIS RANCH WAS THE L.B.J. RANCH.
HIS DOG WAS LITTLE BEAGLE JOHNSON.
McCullough:
AS JOHNSON PREPARED TO RETURN TO WASHINGTON,
THE LIBERALS WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY BEGAN TO ATTACK HIM.
WHEN HE COURTED THE POPULAR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT,
DWIGHT EISENHOWER, THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SELLING OUT.
THEY WANTED STRONGER ACTION ON HOUSING, JOBS
AND CIVIL RIGHTS.
MY OPINION WAS THAT HE WAS DESTROYING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
AND NOT DOING HIS JOB.
HIS JOB WAS THE OPPOSITION TO THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION
AND HE DIDN'T DO IT.
THEY WERE PLAYING JUST HANKY-PANKY WITH EACH OTHER
AND THERE WAS REALLY NO DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.
Shuman:
ONE DOESN'T KNOW
WHETHER HE WAS A LIBERAL OR A REACTIONARY.
PROBABLY HE WAS NEITHER.
HE PROBABLY WAS JUST
AN EXTRAORDINARILY SKILLFUL PARLIAMENTARIAN
WHO WAS AN OPPORTUNIST AND WHO SENSED THE WIND
AND THEN WENT IN THAT DIRECTION.
McCullough:
NO ONE KNEW WHAT JOHNSON REALLY STOOD FOR.
IN 1957, WHEN A CIVIL RIGHTS BILL CAME BEFORE CONGRESS,
IT LOOKED AS IF HE WOULD BE FINALLY FORCED
TO TAKE A STAND.
Politician:
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PERMIT THE N.A.A.C.P.
TO TAKE OVER YOUR SCHOOLS!
WE ARE NOT GOING TO PERMIT OUR LITTLE CHILDREN
TO BE USED AS PAWNS IN A GAME OF POWER POLITICS
TO GET THE RACIAL VOTE IN NORTHERN CITIES!
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT THE COUNTRY WAS LIKE
FOR BLACK PEOPLE IN 1957 AND 1959
WHEN JOHNSON WAS MAJORITY LEADER.
Klan member:
THEY WANT TO THROW WHITE CHILDREN
AND COLORED CHILDREN INTO THE MELTING POT OF INTEGRATION
OUT OF WHICH WILL COME
A CONGLOMERATED, MULATTO, MONGREL CLASS OF PEOPLE!
( people yelling )
Wilkins:
IT WAS STILL A SEGREGATED COUNTRY.
BLACKS STILL COULD EXPECT RANDOM VIOLENCE.
McCullough:
NOBODY KNEW
WHAT THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE WOULD DO.
NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD JOHNSON VOTED FOR A CIVIL RIGHTS BILL.
BUT NOW, DETERMINED TO SHAKE HIS SOUTHERN IMAGE
AND BECOME A TRULY NATIONAL POLITICIAN,
JOHNSON CONFRONTED HIS OLD FRIEND AND MENTOR,
RICHARD RUSSELL OF GEORGIA.
Man:
THE VERY FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO MEET
WITH HIS OLD AND CLOSEST ADVISORS
AND SAY, "THIS TIME, WE ARE GOING TO GET A BILL
AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL FACE UP TO IT."
RICHARD RUSSELL SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL,
BECAUSE THEY REALLY DID FEEL THAT THIS WAS THE BEGINNING
OF THE END OF THE SOUTH AS THEY KNEW IT.
McCullough:
BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE SENATE CLOAKROOM,
JOHNSON MOVED FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER,
FIRST, TRYING TO ASSURE THE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS.
HE WOULD JUST SAY, "IF YOU DON'T PASS THIS MODERATE BILL,
"YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILL CRAMMED DOWN YOUR THROAT
"BECAUSE RICHARD NIXON IS VERY SMART POLITICALLY
"AND HE IS COURTING BLACK PEOPLE RIGHT NOW
AND YOU'LL GET SOMETHING YOU CAN'T LIVE WITH."
McCullough:
AND JOHNSON KNEW JUST WHAT TO TELL THE NORTHERN LIBERALS.
Baker:
I HEARD HIM MANY TIMES CHEW HUBERT HUMPHREY'S ASS OUT.
"HUBERT, IT DON'T TAKE ANY GENIUS
"TO BE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS FROM MINNESOTA.
HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE YOU GOT IN MINNESOTA?"
HUBERT SAID, "WE GOT 12,000."
HE SAID, "YOU MAKE ME SICK."
McCullough:
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER,
THE JOHNSON TREATMENT WAS HAVING ITS EFFECT.
Reporter:
SENATOR, THERE IS SOME TALK OF A COMPROMISE.
DO YOU SEE ANY AREA FOR A COMPROMISE?
WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD ANY COMPROMISE PRESENTED TO ME YET,
BUT I AM A REALIST AND A REASONABLE MAN.
McCullough:
BY SKILLFUL MANEUVERING,
JOHNSON ENGINEERED A BILL ACCEPTABLE TO ALL SIDES.
Johnson:
A COMPROMISE HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED.
I'M PLEASED THAT THE BILL WILL PASS.
IT IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD
IN A VERY IMPORTANT AND DELICATE FIELD.
McCullough:
ON AUGUST 7, THE SENATE PASSED
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1957.
BUT JOHNSON HAD TRADED AWAY THE MUSCLE IN THE LAW.
IN THEORY, THE LAW PROTECTED THE VOTING RIGHTS OF BLACKS.
IN FACT, IT GAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NO REAL POWER
OF ENFORCEMENT.
THAT BILL HAD NOTHING IN IT.
IN FACT, WHEN IT WAS FINALLY PASSED, MR. DOUGLAS SAID
THAT IT REMINDED HIM OF LINCOLN'S OLD SAYING
THAT IT WAS LIKE A SOUP MADE FROM THE SHADOW OF A CROW
WHICH HAD STARVED TO DEATH.
"CAN YOU BELIEVE THOSE BASTARDS?" HE SAID.
"I'M THE FIRST MAN IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY
"TO PASS A CIVIL RIGHTS BILL,
THEN THEY GOT TO GIVE ME THE SHIV."
McCullough:
THE BILL WAS PURE JOHNSON COMPROMISE--
A MASTERPIECE OF SENATE POLITICKING.
BUT IT WAS THE FIRST CIVIL RIGHTS BILL
SINCE RECONSTRUCTION.
JOHNSON HAD FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SHACKLES
OF HIS SOUTHERN IMAGE.
AND HE WAS READY TO MOVE ON.
BY 1960, LYNDON JOHNSON MADE PUBLIC
WHAT EVERYONE ALREADY KNEW:
HE WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Johnson:
THE PERSON YOU SELECT AS YOUR PRESIDENT--
THE WEIGHT HE'S CARRIED, THE BURDENS HE KNOWS,
THE DECISION HE MAKES MAY WELL DETERMINE
WHETHER YOU LIVE AS FREE MEN.
McCullough:
BUT JOHN KENNEDY,
THE YOUNG, WEALTHY, GLAMOROUS SENATOR
WHO JOHNSON HAD CASUALLY DISMISSED AS INEXPERIENCED
HAD THE NOMINATION ALL BUT WRAPPED UP.
JOHNSON RESENTFULLY CALLED KENNEDY "SONNY BOY."
I HAVE FOUND IT EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL SERVING IN THE SENATE
WITH SENATOR JOHNSON AS LEADER.
I THINK IF I EMERGE SUCCESSFULLY IN THIS CONVENTION,
IT WILL BE THE RESULT OF WATCHING SENATOR JOHNSON
PROCEED AROUND THE SENATE FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.
I HAVE LEARNED THE LESSON WELL, LYNDON,
AND I HOPE IT MAY BENEFIT ME IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
McCullough:
ON THE EVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION,
JOHNSON CHALLENGED KENNEDY TO A DEBATE.
KENNEDY COOLLY BRUSHED JOHNSON ASIDE.
Kennedy:
FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR JOHNSON,
FULL OF AFFECTION FOR HIM,
STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF HIM FOR MAJORITY LEADER
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT IN THAT POSITION,
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER.
THANK YOU.
Delegate:
MR. CHAIRMAN,
WYOMING'S VOTE WILL MAKE A MAJORITY
FOR SENATOR KENNEDY.
( loud cheering and applause )
McCullough:
KENNEDY WAS NOMINATED OVERWHELMINGLY
ON THE FIRST BALLOT.
NOW ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS THE VICE-PRESIDENCY,
AND NO ONE WAS SURE WHAT JOHNSON WOULD DO
IF KENNEDY OFFERED IT TO HIM.
Connally:
HE SAID, "WELL, JACK KENNEDY JUST CALLED.
"HE'S COMING DOWN TO SEE ME.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WANTS?"
I SAID, "HE'S GOING TO OFFER YOU THE VICE-PRESIDENCY."
HE SAID, "OH NO, HE'S NOT, HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HE'LL PROBABLY ASK ME TO MANAGE THE CAMPAIGN."
I SAID, "NO, HE'S GOING TO ASK YOU TO BE VICE-PRESIDENT."
HE SAID, "WELL, WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO HIM?"
I SAID, "WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES."
I SAID, "MR. LEADER, LET ME TELL YOU, JOHN KENNEDY KNOWS
"THAT NO CATHOLIC HAS EVER BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT
"IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY.
"HE KNOWS THE ONLY CHANCE IN HELL THAT HE HAS
"TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS
IF YOU RUN AS VICE-PRESIDENT."
I SAID, "THE VICE-PRESIDENCY IS THE WORST JOB IN THE COUNTRY.
"IT'S NOT WORTH A WARM BUCKET OF SPIT,
"AS JOHN NANCE GARNER SAID.
BUT YOU'RE ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENCY."
McCullough:
WHEN KENNEDY OFFERED JOHNSON THE VICE-PRESIDENCY,
NO ONE WAS HAPPY.
THE CONSERVATIVES DIDN'T WANT JOHNSON TO RUN
WITH THE LIBERAL KENNEDY,
AND THE LIBERALS WANTED ONE OF THEIR OWN.
FINALLY THE CANDIDATE'S BROTHER, ROBERT KENNEDY,
PAID JOHNSON A VISIT.
I WAS IN THE ROOM, IN JOHNSON'S BEDROOM,
WITH JOHNSON AND JOHN CONNALLY-- THE THREE OF US ALONE--
ON THE MORNING OF THE NOMINATION FOR THE VICE-PRESIDENCY
AT ABOUT 10:30
WHEN BOBBY KENNEDY STORMED IN AND STARTED SCREAMING AT JOHNSON
THAT IF HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIM,
HE'D GET OFF THAT TICKET.
Baker:
WELL, JOHNSON DID NOT LIKE BOBBY KENNEDY,
AND IT WAS MUTUAL.
THEY HATED EACH OTHER.
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT MR. RAYBURN AND JOHN CONNALLY
WENT IN TO MEET WITH BOBBY KENNEDY.
Connally:
BOBBY KENNEDY SAID THAT ALL HELL HAD BROKEN LOOSE
ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR
AND THAT JOHNSON WAS GOING TO HAVE TO WITHDRAW,
JUST CHANGE HIS MIND AND NOT ACCEPT THE VICE-PRESIDENCY.
AND MR. RAYBURN LOOKED AT HIM AND HE SAID, "AW!"
AND UTTERED AN EXPLETIVE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO USE.
OLD MAN RAYBURN SAID, "SHIT, SONNY," AND KICKED HIM OUT.
I SAID, "YOUR BROTHER CAME DOWN HERE
"AND OFFERED HIM THE VICE-PRESIDENCY
"AND MR. JOHNSON ACCEPTED IT.
"NOW, IF HE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO HAVE IT,
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CALL AND ASK HIM TO WITHDRAW."
AND I AM GRATEFUL, FINALLY,
THAT I CAN RELY IN THE COMING MONTHS ON MANY OTHERS--
ON A DISTINGUISHED RUNNING MATE WHO BRINGS UNITY AND STRENGTH
TO OUR PLATFORM AND OUR TICKET, LYNDON JOHNSON.
Cater:
AND THAT WAS A REAL TRANSFORMATION
IN WHICH THIS YOUNG PUP, JACK KENNEDY, SUDDENLY IS IT,
AND HE, LYNDON JOHNSON, BIG OLD CLUMSY LYNDON JOHNSON,
IS PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE.
AND YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IT--
THAT THOSE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL YEARS WERE AGONY FOR HIM.
Kearns:
IT WAS A TERRIBLE SENSE
OF HAVING LOST THAT CENTER OF DOMINANCE,
AND SUDDENLY I THINK HE FELT LIKE A LITTLE KID
LOOKING IN A GLASS DOOR AT THE CANDY DISPLAY INSIDE
AND HE COULDN'T QUITE REACH IT.
IT WAS DEVASTATING.
Baker:
BOBBY NEVER GOT OVER THE FACT
THAT HIS BROTHER OVERRULED HIM AND PUT JOHNSON ON THE TICKET
AND THERE WAS A MUTUAL DISLIKE
SECOND TO NONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
Cater:
IT WASN'T THE WAY THE PRESIDENT TREATED HIM--
I THINK JACK KENNEDY TREATED HIM WITH DUE RESPECT.
BUT EVERYBODY AROUND KENNEDY KIND OF POKED FUN AT HIM
AND MADE MOCKERY OF "WHATEVER HAPPENED TO LYNDON JOHNSON?"
Baker:
KENNEDY NAMED HIM THE HEAD OF THE SPACE CENTER,
PLUS HE SENT HIM
ON EVERY FOREIGN TRIP IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
TO TRY TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO.
( fiddle music, man singing )
♫DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS, YEAH...♫
McCullough:
VICE-PRESIDENT JOHNSON MADE CEREMONIAL VISITS
TO 26 COUNTRIES.
BUT HE WASN'T THE KIND OF MAN WHO COULD GET THE FEEL
FOR ANOTHER CULTURE.
WHEREVER HE WENT, HE TOOK HIS OWN OVERSIZED BED,
A SPECIAL NOZZLE FOR HIS SHOWER,
DOZENS OF CASES OF CUTTY SARK,
AND THOUSANDS OF PERSONALLY INSCRIBED BALLPOINT PENS
AND CIGARETTE LIGHTERS AS GIFTS.
BUT AT LEAST ABROAD HE WAS CENTER STAGE.
AT HOME, THERE WERE STILL THE KENNEDYS...
URBANE, CHARISMATIC, IMMENSELY POPULAR.
Janeway:
HE WAS CONSUMED WITH THIS PASSION OF INFERIORITY
TOWARDS THE KENNEDYS.
AND THEY GAVE HIM A VERY HARD TIME
WHEN HE WAS VICE-PRESIDENT.
THEY WERE GOING TO DUMP HIM FROM THEIR TICKET.
THEY MADE A BUFFOON OF HIM-- A LAUGHINGSTOCK.
WHEN, AS VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
HE VISITED SCANDINAVIA,
BOBBY KENNEDY SENT AN UNCODED TELEGRAM TO THE EMBASSIES--
UNCODED SO THAT EVERYONE COULD SEE IT--
SAYING THAT THE VICE-PRESIDENT IN NO WAY SPEAKS
FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND IS NOT TO BE RECEIVED AS IF HE WERE AN EMISSARY
OF THE PRESIDENT.
McCullough:
IN 1963, A CHAGRINED AND FRUSTRATED VICE-PRESIDENT
TOLD AN AIDE, "MY FUTURE IS BEHIND ME."
AND THEN, DALLAS.
Lady Bird:
IT ALL BEGAN SO HOPEFULLY.
BUT THE FEELING IN TEXAS WAS NOT GOOD FOR KENNEDY
AND SO OF COURSE WE WERE UPTIGHT.
AND WE WERE GOING ALONG AND I WAS HEAVING A SIGH OF RELIEF.
"THANK THE LORD, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT."
AND THEN CAME, UH, THAT SHOT.
( gunshots )
THE SECRET SERVICE MAN SUDDENLY
VAULTED OVER LYNDON AND PUSHED HIM TO THE FLOOR.
AND HERE WE WERE RACING DOWN AT BREAKNECK SPEED,
NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD TAKEN OVER OUR LIVES.
THIS MAN CAME IN AND TOLD LYNDON THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS DEAD.
I GUESS WE WERE ALL SILENT FOR A WHILE
AND THEN LYNDON SAID, "WE MUST GET TO AIR FORCE ONE."
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE SAT, BUT QUITE A WHILE.
HE SAID,
"DOES ANYBODY IN THIS PLANE KNOW THE OATH OF OFFICE?"
NOBODY DID, WORD FOR WORD, PRECISELY.
HE SAID, "YOU'LL HAVE TO CALL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
AND ASK HIM."
WHAT AN EXCRUCIATING CALL.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS BOBBY KENNEDY.
Judge:
I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR...
Johnson:
I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR...
Judge:
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE...
Johnson:
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE...
Judge:
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES...
Johnson:
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES...
McCullough:
A BELOVED PRESIDENT WAS GONE
AND IN HIS PLACE STOOD THIS BIG TEXAN
WITH AN UNSAVORY PAST.
THE KENNEDYS DISTRUSTED HIM.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE SUSPICIOUS, STUNNED AND BAFFLED.
ON NOVEMBER 22, 1963,
LYNDON JOHNSON BECAME THE 36th PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
McCullough:
"I TOOK THE OATH," JOHNSON SAID,
"BUT FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS I WAS STILL ILLEGITIMATE--
"A NAKED MAN WITH NO PRESIDENTIAL COVERING,
"A PRETENDER TO THE THRONE, AN ILLEGAL USURPER.
"AND THEN THERE WERE THE BIGOTS AND THE DIVIDERS
"AND THE EASTERN INTELLECTUALS,
"WHO WERE WAITING TO KNOCK ME DOWN
"BEFORE I COULD EVEN BEGIN TO STAND UP.
THE WHOLE THING WAS ALMOST UNBEARABLE."
( drums playing funeral cadence )
RUMORS OF DARK SCHEMES AND CONSPIRACIES WERE EVERYWHERE.
ANXIOUS AMERICANS KNEW LITTLE ABOUT THE NEW PRESIDENT.
WHAT THEY DID KNOW
WAS THAT THEIR BELOVED JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS GONE.
"I ALWAYS FELT SORRY FOR HARRY TRUMAN
AND THE WAY HE GOT THE PRESIDENCY,"
JOHNSON TOLD AN AIDE,
"BUT AT LEAST HIS MAN WASN'T MURDERED."
Man:
MR. SPEAKER...
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
McCullough:
PRESIDENT FOR ONLY FIVE DAYS,
JOHNSON ADDRESSED A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS.
AFTER DECADES IN WASHINGTON, HE KNEW THEM ALL,
AND HE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE THINKING.
WOULD HE MEASURE UP?
MR. SPEAKER, MR. PRESIDENT,
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, MEMBERS OF THE SENATE,
MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
ALL I HAVE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN GLADLY
NOT TO BE STANDING HERE TODAY.
THE GREATEST LEADER OF OUR TIME HAS BEEN STRUCK DOWN
BY THE FOULEST DEED OF OUR TIME.
TODAY, JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY
LIVES ON IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS AND WORKS THAT HE LEFT BEHIND.
McCullough:
HE WAS NEVER VERY GOOD AT FORMAL SPEECHES,
BUT IN THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEECH OF HIS LIFE
HE REASSURED A SHOCKED AND GRIEVING NATION.
JOHN F. KENNEDY TOLD HIS COUNTRYMEN
THAT OUR NATIONAL WORK WOULD NOT BE FINISHED
IN THE FIRST THOUSAND DAYS,
NOR IN THE LIFE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION,
"BUT," HE SAID,
"LET US BEGIN."
TODAY, IN THIS MOMENT OF NEW RESOLVE,
I WOULD SAY TO ALL MY FELLOW AMERICANS...
"LET US CONTINUE."
( applause )
McCullough:
WITH A FEW SIMPLE WORDS,
HE INVOKED THE LEGACY OF THE DEAD PRESIDENT.
THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD CARRY ON.
"I KNEW IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT I GRASP THE REINS OF POWER
AND DO SO WITHOUT DELAY," JOHNSON LATER WROTE.
HE CONVINCED A RELUCTANT AND GRIEVING KENNEDY CABINET
TO STAY ON,
INCLUDING ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY.
I SAID, "THESE ARE ALL KENNEDY PEOPLE.
"A LOT OF THEM ARE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT THEY ARE KENNEDY PEOPLE.
THEY WERE COMMITTED TO HIM, NOT TO YOU."
I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL BE DISLOYAL
"BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY CAN'T HAVE THE SAME FEELING FOR YOU
"THAT THEY HAD FOR JACK KENNEDY.
YOU'RE ENTITLED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TO HAVE YOUR OWN CABINET, PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW, WHOM YOU TRUST."
"WELL," HE SAID, "I JUST CAN'T CHANGE THEM NOW.
I'LL CHANGE THEM AFTER THE ELECTION IN '64."
McCullough:
"I HAD TO TAKE THE DEAD MAN'S PROGRAM
AND TURN IT INTO A MARTYR'S CAUSE," HE SAID.
"THAT WAY, KENNEDY WOULD LIVE ON FOREVER--
AND SO WOULD I."
AN ACCIDENT OF HISTORY HAD GIVEN HIM THE POWER
THAT HE HAD REACHED FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE.
NOW HE WAS DETERMINED, AS HE SAID,
"TO BE THE GREATEST PRESIDENT OF THEM ALL--
THE WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM."
Woman ( chanting ):
FREEDOM, FREEDOM.
GOT TO HAVE FREEDOM, FREEDOM...
McCullough:
HIS FIRST TEST WOULD BE CIVIL RIGHTS.
RACIAL TENSIONS COULD NO LONGER BE TEMPERED BY COMPROMISE.
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS DEMANDING FREEDOM...
NOW.
JOHNSON'S ABRUPT ASSUMPTION OF THE PRESIDENCY HAD CONVERGED
WITH THE FIERCE STRUGGLE FOR BLACK EQUALITY.
IN 1964, RACIAL SEGREGATION STILL RULED THE SOUTH
BY BOTH LAW AND CUSTOM.
AND LYNDON JOHNSON WAS A SOUTHERNER
BURDENED BY A HISTORY OF VACILLATION, COMPROMISE
AND A LONG STRING OF VOTES THAT HAD KEPT SEGREGATION STRONG.
CIVIL RIGHTS WOULD MEASURE THE LIMITS
OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S MORAL IMAGINATION.
Wilkins:
A SOUTHERN ACCENT WENT A LONG WAY TO RAISE MY DEFENSES.
SO WHEN JOHNSON BECAME PRESIDENT,
I WAS FEARFUL-- VERY, VERY UNHAPPY.
McCullough:
WITH CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS CONFRONTING
SEGREGATION ALL ACROSS THE SOUTH,
MANY AMERICANS WONDERED HOW THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD REACT.
Man:
JOHNSON DID NOT APPROVE OF, HE DID NOT LIKE--
I CAN EVEN USE A STRONGER TERM--
HE HATED THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE MOVEMENT IN THE STREET.
HE HATED THEM.
BUT HE HAD ENOUGH SENSITIVITY
THAT HE KNEW THAT ALL HELL WAS GOING TO BREAK LOOSE
IF WE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
McCullough:
CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS LAY SIEGE
TO A SEGREGATED SOCIETY.
THERE WERE SIT-INS AT LUNCH COUNTERS,
ON TRAINS AND BUSES, IN HOTELS AND THEATERS,
FORCING JOHNSON TO ACT.
WHEN SOME OF JOHNSON'S AIDES ADVISED HIM
NOT TO LAY THE PRESTIGE OF THE PRESIDENCY ON THE LINE,
HE RESPONDED, "WHAT'S IT FOR
IF IT'S NOT TO BE LAID ON THE LINE?"
Wilkins:
HE SAID OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THOSE DAYS,
"I'M GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT
WHO FINISHES WHAT LINCOLN BEGAN."
HE SAID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
WELL, IT WAS GREAT RHETORIC, BUT YOU ALSO KNEW
THAT IT WAS A GREAT READING OF HISTORY;
THAT IF, IN FACT, HE COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT,
HE'D HAVE BELONGED UP THERE ON MOUNT RUSHMORE.
McCullough:
A BILL TO PROHIBIT
THE SEGREGATION OF BLACKS AND WHITES IN PUBLIC FACILITIES
HAD BEEN PUT BEFORE CONGRESS BY JOHN KENNEDY,
BUT IT WAS STALLED.
JOHNSON DETERMINED TO ACT.
THIS BILL IS GOING TO PASS IF IT TAKES US ALL SUMMER,
AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE SIGNED AND ENACTED INTO LAW
BECAUSE JUSTICE AND MORALITY DEMAND IT.
Wilkins:
ALL OF A SUDDEN
THERE WAS A POWER AND A FORCE BEHIND THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION
THAT WE HADN'T SEEN IN THE KENNEDY TIME.
AND WITH THAT MY VIEW ABOUT HIM BEGAN TO CHANGE.
McCullough:
THE FULL FORCE OF THE JOHNSON TREATMENT,
PERFECTED IN THE SENATE,
NOW BECAME A WEAPON IN THE ARSENAL OF THE PRESIDENCY.
Farmer:
HE WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH REPUBLICAN SENATORS AND WITH SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS,
AND HE WAS BARGAINING WITH THEM.
HE WAS TELLING THEM ABOUT SOME BRIDGE THAT THEY WANTED
BACK HOME OR SOME DAM THAT THEY WANTED,
AND HE WOULD HELP THEM WITH THAT IF THEY WOULD HELP HIM WITH THIS
AND GIVE HIM THIS THING THAT HE WANTED,
THAT THE WHOLE NATION WANTED AND THE NATION HAD TO HAVE.
AND HE WAS ALSO REMINDING THEM IN NOT TOO SUBTLE TONES
THAT IF THEY DIDN'T SUPPORT HIM,
HE WOULD HAVE WAYS OF GETTING BACK AT THEM.
Man:
SO IN THOSE DAYS WE PLAYED HARD BALL.
MY CATALOGUE INCLUDED A NUMBER OF SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN.
THEY'D SAY, "WELL, JACK, THERE'S NO WAY I CAN VOTE FOR THAT."
AND I'D SAY, "WELL, MR. CONGRESSMAN, NOW,
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THIS, THIS AND THIS THAT YOU WANT,
"AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE PREPARED
"TO DEAL WITH YOU ON THAT
"UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ENTREATIES
FROM THE PRESIDENT."
WE LET THEM KNOW
THAT FOR EVERY NEGATIVE VOTE THERE WOULD BE A PRICE TO PAY.
AND HE KEPT SAYING TO HIS SOUTHERN FRIENDS,
"IF I CAN ADVOCATE IT AS PRESIDENT,
"YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR IT IN YOUR CONSTITUENCY.
"THIS MAY BE THE BEST CHANCE WE'LL EVER HAVE.
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE WAY OF DOING THINGS."
IT'S NOT LIKE A YANKEE FROM NEW YORK
SAYING WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS;
THIS WAS A SOUTHERNER SAYING IT OUGHT TO BE DONE.
AND THAT HELPED;
IT DIDN'T HELP A WHOLE LOT,
BECAUSE THE SOUTHERN BOYS KNEW
THAT THEY, AGAIN, WERE GOING TO CATCH HECK FOR IT.
THAT'S WHAT HE GOT FROM THE SOUTHERNERS--
THAT "YOU'RE KILLING US BY LOVING UP THE NIGGERS.
YOU'RE RIPPING THE PARTY APART;
YOU'RE HURTING US."
AND JOHNSON'S ANSWER WAS, "THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO,
"AND THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO,
AND THIS IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SUPPOSED TO DO."
McCullough:
ONCE AGAIN,
THE LEADER OF THE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS,
HIS OLD FRIEND AND MENTOR RICHARD RUSSELL,
STOOD IN HIS WAY.
BUT WE ARE NOT YET READY TO SURRENDER
IN OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL,
WHICH WE FEEL IS A PERVERSION OF THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE...
Valenti:
AND HE SAID TO DICK RUSSELL,
"I WANT THIS CIVIL RIGHTS BILL PASSED,
AND YOU NOR NO ONE ELSE IS GOING TO STAND IN MY WAY."
AND I REMEMBER RICHARD RUSSELL SAID TO HIM,
SAID, "WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, YEAH, YOU MAY DO IT,
"BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S GOING TO COST YOU THE SOUTH,
AND IT WILL COST YOU AN ELECTION."
McCullough:
SOUTHERN SENATORS PREPARED TO FILIBUSTER
TO PREVENT THE BILL FROM EVER COMING TO A VOTE
BY TALKING IT TO DEATH,
BUT JOHNSON WAS NOT TO BE DENIED.
Rauh:
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID WAS TO SAY,
"THEY CAN FILIBUSTER TILL HELL FREEZES OVER.
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT ANYTHING ELSE ON THAT FLOOR."
SO THE FILIBUSTER COULDN'T WIN.
AND THAT WAS JOHNSON'S GREAT CONTRIBUTION
TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL.
McCullough:
THE DEBATE PARALYZED THE SENATE FOR 83 DAYS.
IT WAS THE LONGEST FILIBUSTER IN SENATE HISTORY.
AND THEN THE SENATE VOTED TO STOP THE TALKING.
THE BILL PASSED.
THAT SAME EVENING, AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING,
JOHNSON REACHED CONGRESSMAN JAKE PICKLE,
ONE OF ONLY SIX SOUTHERNERS TO VOTE IN ITS FAVOR.
Pickle:
AND HE SAID, "NOW, JAKE," HE SAYS,
"THIS IS YOUR PRESIDENT."
HE SAID, "I KNOW IT'S LATE AND I KNOW WHERE YOU'VE BEEN."
I SAID, "WHERE HAVE I BEEN?"
HE SAID, "YOU'VE BEEN OUT HAVING A FEW DRINKS
"AND TRYING TO VOTE...
TRYING TO FORGET THAT VOTE YOU CAST.
YOU VOTED FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FORGET IT."
AND I SAID, "I SURE HAVE BEEN."
HE SAID, "BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH HECK, AREN'T YOU?"
AND I SAID, "YES, SIR, I'M AFRAID I WILL."
HE SAID, "WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, THE REASON I KEEP CALLING
"IS I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOUR PRESIDENT IS EXTREMELY PROUD OF YOU."
HE SAID, "I HAD CHANCES TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHEN I WAS A CONGRESSMAN."
HE SAID, "I DIDN'T, AND I'VE ALWAYS REGRETTED IT."
HE SAID, "YOU DID SOMETHING I THOUGHT WAS BASICALLY RIGHT,
"AND I DIDN'T WANT THIS NIGHT TO GO BY UNTIL
I CALLED ON YOU PERSONALLY TO TELL YOU HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU."
HE SAID, "I AM."
"NOW," HE SAID, "GO TO SLEEP."
OF COURSE, I COULDN'T.
BETWEEN THE VOTE AND THAT CALL, IT WAS HARD TO GO TO SLEEP THEN.
I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
TALKING WITH HIM,
I ASKED HIM HOW HE GOT TO BE THE WAY HE WAS.
HE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"
I SAID, "WELL, HERE YOU ARE, CALLING SENATORS,
"TWISTING THEIR ARMS, THREATENING THEM, CAJOLING THEM,
"TRYING TO LINE UP VOTES FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL
"WHEN YOUR OWN RECORD ON CIVIL RIGHTS WAS NOT A GOOD ONE
"BEFORE YOU BECAME VICE-PRESIDENT.
SO WHAT ACCOUNTED FOR THE CHANGE?"
JOHNSON THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND WRINKLED HIS BROW.
AND THEN HE SAID, "WELL, I'LL ANSWER THAT
"BY QUOTING A GOOD FRIEND OF YOURS,
"AND YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THE QUOTE INSTANTLY.
"'FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST,
THANK GOD ALMIGHTY, I'M FREE AT LAST!
'"
Announcer:
CONGRESS PASSES THE MOST SWEEPING CIVIL RIGHTS BILL
EVER TO BE WRITTEN INTO THE LAW,
AND THUS REAFFIRMS THE CONCEPTION
OF EQUALITY FOR ALL MEN THAT BEGAN WITH LINCOLN
AND THE CIVIL WAR 100 YEARS AGO.
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964...
McCullough:
WHEN LYNDON JOHNSON SIGNED
THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL INTO LAW,
A CENTURY OF ENFORCED SEGREGATION WAS FINALLY OVER.
BLACKS AND WHITES COULD RIDE THE SAME BUSES,
EAT AT THE SAME RESTAURANTS, USE THE SAME WASHROOMS,
STAY AT THE SAME HOTELS.
A SOUTHERN PRESIDENT HAD BROKEN
THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM OF SEGREGATION.
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MAN.
I MEAN, HE HAD A PRETTY SHODDY CAREER,
AND HE'D DONE SOME PRETTY RUTHLESS AND AWFUL THINGS,
BUT HE KNEW POVERTY AND HE KNEW RACISM,
AND I REALLY THINK THAT HE DECIDED
THAT THIS WAS THE WAY TO ASSURE HIS PLACE IN HISTORY.
THIS WAS THE WAY TO REALLY SAVE THE NATION.
AND HE KNEW IT WAS NOT POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT,
BUT I THINK HE REALLY KNEW IT WAS RIGHT.
Janeway:
HIS ATTITUDE GOING IN
WAS THAT KENNEDY COULDN'T PASS ANYTHING.
"I WILL PASS EVERYTHING THAT KENNEDY FAILED TO DO.
"WHERE KENNEDY FAILED, I WILL SUCCEED.
"I AM KENNEDY'S TRUSTEE;
I WILL OUT-KENNEDY KENNEDY.
"I WILL PERFORM WHERE KENNEDY PROMISED.
PERIOD."
ESPECIALLY VIETNAM.
( man shouting commands in Vietnamese )
McCullough:
FAR ACROSS THE WORLD,
IN A SMALL COUNTRY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA,
THERE WERE OMINOUS FOREBODINGS OF A WAR
THAT WOULD ONE DAY CONSUME LYNDON JOHNSON'S PRESIDENCY.
Man:
I BELIEVE JOHNSON WISHED HE'D NEVER HEARD OF VIETNAM.
HE DIDN'T HAVE AN INTEREST IN VIETNAM.
HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA
WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE WISHED IT HAD NEVER COME TO HIM, BUT IT HAD.
HE COULDN'T PASS THE BUCK ANY LONGER.
THIS WAS THE GREAT TRAGEDY REALLY OF HIS PRESIDENCY.
Reedy:
I CAN RECALL ONE NIGHT ON A VERY LONG WALK WITH HIM
AROUND THE SOUTH GROUNDS OF THE WHITE HOUSE
WHERE HE SAID THAT VIETNAM WAS GOING TO BE HIS DOWNFALL;
THAT VIETNAM WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM A ROLE IN HISTORY
THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY NEGATIVE.
Reedy:
VIETNAM HAD NOT FIGURED VERY PROMINENTLY
IN THE AMERICAN PRESS.
MOST AMERICANS DIDN'T HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA
WHERE IT WAS OR WHY IT WAS THERE.
I KNOW I MYSELF, FOR INSTANCE, WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
I HAD ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN'S BOOKS,
"CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD."
I UNDERSTOOD MOST OF IT:
LITTLE DUTCH BOY, LITTLE DUTCH GIRL;
LITTLE CHINESE BOY, LITTLE CHINESE GIRL.
BUT ONE PAGE HAD ME BAFFLED.
IT WAS A PLACE CALLED INDOCHINA.
McCullough:
JOHNSON DIDN'T START THE WAR IN VIETNAM;
HE INHERITED IT.
THREE PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM--
TRUMAN, EISENHOWER, AND KENNEDY--
HAD SENT AMERICAN ADVISORS AND WEAPONS
TO HELP FIGHT A NATIONALIST UPRISING LED BY COMMUNISTS.
BY 1963, 16,000 AMERICAN ADVISORS WERE ALREADY THERE.
VIETNAM WAS DIVIDED IN TWO.
SOUTH VIETNAM-
- WEAK, CORRUPT AND DEPENDENT ON AMERICAN AID--
WAS FIGHTING THE VIETCONG, A GUERRILLA ARMY
THAT RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNISTS IN THE NORTH.
( soldiers singing )
McCullough:
IN THE NORTH, JOHNSON WOULD FIND
ADVERSARIES WITH A WILL AS POWERFUL AS HIS OWN.
THEY WANTED ONE VIETNAM, NOT TWO.
THEY HAD RESISTED THE JAPANESE AND DEFEATED THE FRENCH.
THEY WERE NOT AFRAID OF THE AMERICANS.
THEIR LEADER WAS A MAN THEY CALLED "UNCLE HO."
HO CHI MINH WAS A SOLDIER, A POLITICIAN
AND A DEDICATED MARXIST...
RUTHLESS WHEN NECESSARY, READY TO RISK EVERYTHING
TO UNITE HIS COUNTRY.
TO THE VIETNAMESE, HO CHI MINH WAS A PATRIOT.
TO LYNDON JOHNSON, HE WAS JUST ANOTHER COMMUNIST.
LESS THAN ONE MONTH BEFORE JOHNSON BECAME PRESIDENT,
SOUTH VIETNAM WAS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE.
( gunfire )
Man:
PRESIDENT JOHNSON INHERITED
A VIETNAM SITUATION THAT WAS DETERIORATING.
THE POLITICAL SITUATION WAS DETERIORATING;
THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS DETERIORATING.
I REMEMBER VIVIDLY THAT IT WAS ABOUT...
OH, IT WAS THE SUNDAY AFTER HE WAS SWORN IN
THAT HE HAD A MEETING IN WHICH HE SAID,
"WE ARE GOING TO CARRY ON WITH THIS."
AND THAT WAS THE THEME:
CONTINUITY.
WE ARE NOT CHANGING THINGS;
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK.
Kearns:
HIS NEED TO FIGHT THAT WAR
WAS OUT OF A WHOLE WORLD VIEW
THAT HE SHARED WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY:
THAT WHAT VIETNAM REALLY REPRESENTED
WAS A HUGE STRUGGLE IN THE COLD WAR WITH THE COMMUNISTS
AND THAT IF YOU GAVE AN INCH SOMEWHERE,
SOMEHOW THEY WOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
Announcer:
THE AIM OF THE COMMUNISTS
IS TO ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER ALL OF VIETNAM...
AND AFTER THAT, OVER ALL OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.
Man:
PEOPLE GOT ENTRANCED BY MAPS
AND GREAT RED LINES SWEEPING SOUTHWARD AND THEN WESTWARD.
THIS GREAT CARTOGRAPHIC FALLACY IN FACT SEIZED THE MINDS
OF MEN WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER AT THE TOP.
McCullough:
JUST TWO DAYS IN OFFICE, JOHNSON TOLD AN AIDE,
"THE CHINESE AND THE FELLOWS IN THE KREMLIN,
"THEY'LL BE TAKING THE MEASURE OF US.
"THEY'LL BE WONDERING JUST HOW FAR THEY CAN GO.
"THEY'LL THINK WITH KENNEDY DEAD, WE'VE LOST HEART.
THEY'LL THINK WE'RE YELLOW AND DON'T MEAN WHAT WE SAY."
Man:
PRESIDENT JOHNSON,
IN ONE OF HIS MORE HYPERBOLIC MOODS,
SAID HE FELT WE HAD RATHER
FACE THE THREAT OF COMMUNISM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
THAN FACE IT ON THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES.
McCullough:
THE PRESIDENT TURNED
TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT McNAMARA--
"THE MOST COMPETENT MAN I EVER KNEW;
THE MOST OBJECTIVE MAN I EVER MET," JOHNSON SAID.
THE PRESIDENT AFFECTIONATELY CALLED HIM "MY LARD HAIR MAN."
THERE'S NO QUESTION IN OUR MINDS
BUT WHAT THE COMMUNISTS HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR RATE OF ATTACK
IN RECENT WEEKS IN SOUTH VIETNAM.
McCullough:
WHEN McNAMARA PROPOSED AN INCREASE
IN AMERICAN ADVISORS AND COVERT COMMANDO RAIDS
AGAINST THE NORTH, JOHNSON AGREED.
Thomson:
THERE WAS A STRONG SENSE
THAT AMERICANS WERE "CAN DO" PEOPLE
AND THAT ANYTHING WE PUT OUR MIND TO WE COULD ACCOMPLISH.
AND THE KIND OF RURAL, JUNGLE WARFARE THAT THE COMMUNISTS
WERE INFLICTING ON US IN THE THIRD WORLD, WE COULD ADAPT
AND WE COULD WIN AT IT
BECAUSE WE WERE SMARTER, WE HAD MORE TECHNOLOGY,
WE HAD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND WE WOULD PREVAIL.
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF MY COUNTRY,
THE UNITED STATES,
STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE PEOPLE OF YOURS.
McCullough:
JOHNSON MADE IT McNAMARA'S WAR.
"I WANT THEM TO GET OFF THEIR BUTTS
"AND GET OUT IN THOSE JUNGLES
AND WHIP HELL OUT OF SOME COMMUNISTS," HE SAID.
"AND THEN I WANT THEM TO LEAVE ME ALONE
"BECAUSE I'VE GOT SOME BIGGER THINGS TO DO
RIGHT HERE AT HOME."
( applause )
AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, TODAY, HERE AND NOW,
DECLARES UNCONDITIONAL WAR ON POVERTY IN AMERICA.
McCullough:
THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY
WAS THE WAR THAT JOHNSON REALLY WANTED TO FIGHT.
IN HIS FIRST "STATE OF THE UNION" ADDRESS
HE REACHED BACK TO THE POPULISM OF HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER.
HE TOOK A KENNEDY ANTI-POVERTY PROPOSAL AND MADE IT HIS OWN.
Johnson:
IT WILL NOT BE A SHORT OR EASY STRUGGLE,
BUT WE SHALL NOT REST UNTIL THAT WAR IS WON.
THE RICHEST NATION ON EARTH CAN AFFORD TO WIN IT.
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE IT.
McCullough:
WHEN LYNDON JOHNSON BECAME PRESIDENT, 35 MILLION AMERICANS WERE LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE
IN THE MOST AFFLUENT COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
Cater:
AND I SAID, "BUT THEY DON'T VOTE.
"THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ORGANIZED LOBBIES.
"HOW IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GOING TO GET
"ANY SUBSTANTIAL LEGISLATION ON POVERTY?
JACK KENNEDY COULDN'T;
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT?"
HE LEANED BACK AND HE SAID--
AND THESE WORDS ARE ENGRAVED ON MY MEMORY--
HE SAID, "I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'LL PASS A SINGLE LAW
"OR GET A SINGLE DOLLAR APPROPRIATED,
"BUT BEFORE I'M THROUGH, NO COMMUNITY IN AMERICA
IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO IGNORE THE POVERTY IN ITS MIDST."
McCullough:
JOHNSON NOW TURNED
TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE PEACE CORPS, SARGENT SHRIVER.
Shriver:
ONE SATURDAY MORNING,
HE CALLED ME UP AND SAID THAT HIS RADIO SHOW,
WHICH HE HAD EVERY SATURDAY,
WAS GOING TO GO ON IN A COUPLE OF HOURS
AND HE WANTED TO ANNOUNCE ON THAT SHOW THAT I WAS GOING TO BE
THE NEW HEAD OF THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY,
OR THE HEAD OF THE NEW WAR AGAINST POVERTY.
AND I SAID, "WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, REALLY, YOU KNOW,
"I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO MY WIFE.
"I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK
"TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE.
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'LL THINK ABOUT IT IN THE PEACE CORPS.
"COULDN'T YOU JUST POSTPONE THAT?
FRANKLY, I WOULD RATHER TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT NEXT WEEK."
HE SAID, "WELL NOW, SARGENT, NO, THE TRUTH IS
"WE'VE GOT TO GET ON WITH THAT WAR AGAINST POVERTY,
"SO PLEASE TALK TO EUNICE NOW, JUST TALK TO HER NOW,
AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK."
SO I PUT THE PHONE DOWN;
I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS.
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THE PHONE RANG AGAIN.
THERE WAS THE PRESIDENT ON IT.
HE SAID, "WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED?"
I SAID, "WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, IT WOULD REALLY BE MUCH BETTER
"FOR ME AND MY FAMILY
"IF WE COULD JUST TALK ABOUT THIS NEXT MONDAY OR TUESDAY,
"AND SEE WHAT...
HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO,
"AND I'M AFRAID IF YOU ANNOUNCE
"THAT I'M THE HEAD OF THE WAR ON POVERTY
"PEOPLE WILL ASK ME WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT IT,
"AND I DON'T KNOW, AND THAT WILL BE A SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT
TO ME AND MAYBE NOT SO GOOD FOR YOU."
HE SAID, "WELL, SARGE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE THIS RADIO PROGRAM.
IT'S GOING ON IN ABOUT AN HOUR."
HE SAID, "LET ME CALL YOU BACK."
SO HE CALLED ME BACK ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER
AND IN A VERY LOW VOICE, CONFIDENTIAL-SOUNDING VOICE,
HE SAID, "NOW, LISTEN, I'M GOING TO ANNOUNCE YOU.
"AND I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT LOUD
"BECAUSE I HAVE THE WHOLE CABINET HERE.
"BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, SARGENT,
"THIS IS YOUR PRESIDENT SPEAKING,
"AND I'M GOING TO ANNOUNCE YOU
AS THE HEAD OF THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY."
BUNG.
SO HELP ME GOD.
I TURNED TO MY WIFE,
AND I SAID, "IT LOOKS AS IF I'M GOING TO BE
THE NEW HEAD OF THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY."
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S PROGRAM ON POVERTY
IS DISTINGUISHED IN AT LEAST FOUR WAYS...
McCullough:
IN SIX SHORT WEEKS,
JOHNSON HAD COME UP WITH HIS PACKAGE.
BUT HE WOULD LET SHRIVER WORRY ABOUT THE DETAILS.
Shriver:
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT HE DESIRED.
I KNEW WHAT HE DESIRED.
HE WANTED TO GET GOING BIG
AND HE WANTED TO GET GOING WITH SUCCESS.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME THAT.
McCullough:
JOHNSON CRISSCROSSED THE COUNTRY,
APPEALING FOR SUPPORT FOR HIS ANTI-POVERTY LEGISLATION.
POVERTY IN AMERICA HAD BEEN INVISIBLE.
JOHNSON PUT IT ON THE FRONT PAGES.
Johnson:
OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO FREE 30 MILLION AMERICANS
FROM THE PRISON OF POVERTY.
CAN YOU HELP US FREE THESE AMERICANS?
AND IF YOU CAN, LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICES!
McCullough:
FOR JOHNSON,
IT WAS A RETURN TO HIS POLITICAL PAST,
THE OLD BATTLE CRIES OF THE NEW DEAL COMING ALIVE AGAIN.
Man:
HE WAS THE LAST SOLDIER IN THE NEW DEAL WAR,
THE FINAL EXPRESSION OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAD GONE ON
IN THE '30s AND '40s:
GOVERNMENT AS MOTHER, FATHER, SMOTHERING,
LYNDON JOHNSON, BIG ARMS AROUND YOU--
"I LOVE YOU, I WANT YOU TO DO BETTER."
DO SOMETHING WE CAN BE PROUD OF.
HELP THE WEAK AND THE MEEK AND LIFT THEM UP
AND HELP THEM TRAIN AND GIVE THEM AN EDUCATION
WHERE THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN WAY
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO LIVE OFF THE BOUNTY OF OUR GENEROSITY.
Dugger:
MOST PEOPLE DON'T ACTIVELY CARE
ABOUT PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW,
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING.
IT'S HARD FOR US TO REMEMBER THOSE PEOPLE.
LYNDON NEVER REALLY FORGOT THEM, I THINK.
I REALLY THINK HE NEVER DID.
Dallek:
HIS VISION WAS OF HELPING THE DISADVANTAGED
TO HELP THEMSELVES.
HIS HOPE WAS THAT YOU GIVE THEM EDUCATION,
YOU GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITY,
YOU GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO COME INTO THE MAINSTREAM
OF AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS ECONOMIC LIFE.
AND THAT'S AS THOROUGHLY AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE.
Johnson:
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT
THE JOBS THAT PROVIDE FOOD FOR OUR FAMILIES,
A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS, CLOTHES FOR THEIR BODIES.
AND WITH YOUR HELP, AND WITH GOD'S HELP,
WE WILL HAVE IT IN AMERICA.
THANK YOU.
( cheering )
McCullough:
JOHNSON WOULD MAKE WAR ON POVERTY
AND THERE WOULD BE NO CASUALTIES.
EVERYONE WOULD BE A WINNER, EVEN BIG BUSINESS.
HE WOULD TELL BUSINESS PEOPLE,
"LISTEN, WE'VE GOT A VERY ABUNDANT COUNTRY.
"WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCES TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
"WHO ARE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM.
"FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT YOUR INTEREST"-- IN EFFECT HE WAS ARGUING--
"YOUR INTEREST AS A BUSINESS LEADER IS THE WELFARE STATE
BECAUSE YOU KEEP EVERYTHING STABLE."
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY APPEALING ARGUMENT
TO A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE,
WHO WAS NOW TO THE RIGHT OF ATTILA THE HUN,
THAT IN A CIVILIZED COUNTRY WITH SUCH ABUNDANCE AS WE HAVE--
ASTOUNDING ABUNDANCE COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD--
YOU CAN AFFORD TO BE LIBERAL WITH THE POOR.
Shriver:
WE WERE A GENERATION OF PEOPLE
WHO HAD BEEN IN WORLD WAR II.
SO WHEN A WAR AGAINST POVERTY WAS LAUNCHED,
IT WAS TYPICAL OF ALL OF US AT THAT TIME
TO THINK OF THIS WAR, THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY,
IN TERMS JUST LIKE THE WAR AGAINST HITLER.
WE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO THINKING IN TERMS
OF THE UNITED STATES BEING ABLE TO DO BIG THINGS.
AMERICA BESTRODE THE WORLD LIKE A COLOSSUS.
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD EQUAL
TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
McCullough:
THE WAR ON POVERTY WAS JUST PART
OF JOHNSON'S PROGRAM FOR THE COUNTRY.
FEW ANTICIPATED THAT THIS COARSE AND ABRASIVE TEXAN
WOULD PROPOSE A SERIES OF LAWS
TO ENRICH DAILY LIFE FOR ALL AMERICANS.
HE CALLED HIS VISION "THE GREAT SOCIETY."
THE GREAT SOCIETY IS A PLACE
WHERE EVERY CHILD CAN FIND KNOWLEDGE TO ENRICH HIS MIND
AND TO ENLARGE HIS TALENTS.
IT IS A PLACE WHERE LEISURE IS THE WELCOME CHANCE
TO BUILD AND REFLECT,
NOT A FEARED CAUSE OF BOREDOM AND RESTLESSNESS.
IT IS A PLACE WHERE THE CITY OF MAN SERVES
NOT ONLY THE NEEDS OF THE BODY AND THE DEMANDS OF COMMERCE,
BUT THE DESIRE FOR BEAUTY AND THE HUNGER FOR COMMUNITY.
McCullough:
IT WAS AN INFLATED RHETORIC,
THE KIND AMERICAN LEADERS SELDOM USE ANYMORE.
IT IS A PLACE WHICH HONORS CREATION FOR ITS OWN SAKE.
McCullough:
AS ONE AIDE DESCRIBED IT,
"WHAT HE MEANT WAS A FULL STOMACH, YES,
BUT A FULLER LIFE, TOO."
IT IS A PLACE WHERE MEN ARE MORE CONCERNED
WITH THE QUALITY OF THEIR GOALS
THAN THE QUANTITY OF THEIR GOODS.
( applause )
McCullough:
HIS ASPIRATIONS WERE ENORMOUS.
HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.
HE WANTED TO BE THE BEST FATHER AMERICANS EVER HAD.
BUT IN 1964, JOHNSON STILL THOUGHT OF HIMSELF
AS STANDING IN JOHN KENNEDY'S SHADOW.
HE HATED THAT HE WAS MERELY AN ACCIDENTAL PRESIDENT.
HE WANTED TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT IN HIS OWN RIGHT.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS GOING TO MAKE IT EASY.
I WOULD REMIND YOU
THAT EXTREMISM IN THE DEFENSE OF LIBERTY IS NO VICE.
( cheering )
McCullough:
IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY,
AT THE COW PALACE IN SAN FRANCISCO,
THE RIGHT WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TRIUMPHED.
A MAJOR-GENERAL IN THE AIR FORCE RESERVE,
ARIZONA SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER, WAS NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT.
GOLDWATER'S CAMPAIGN SLOGAN WAS,
"IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT."
SOME WAG APPENDED "FAR RIGHT."
AND IT STUCK.
THANK YOU.
I'LL SAY SO THAT ALL AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HEAR,
THAT THE ONLY ENEMY OF PEACE IN THE WORLD IS COMMUNISM.
AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER IT'S RED CHINESE COMMUNISM
OR RUSSIAN COMMUNISM OR WHOSE COMMUNISM IT IS, IT'S COMMUNISM.
McCullough:
JOHNSON WATCHED GOLDWATER ON TELEVISION,
THEN FLICKED OFF THE SET WITH A SMILE.
GOLDWATER HAD ACCUSED THE DEMOCRATS
OF BEING SOFT ON COMMUNISM.
IF JOHNSON COULD PROVE HE WAS AS STAUNCH AS HIS REPUBLICAN RIVAL,
HE WOULD HAVE MORE THAN A VICTORY.
THE 1964 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD BE A LANDSLIDE.
LESS THAN THREE WEEKS LATER, CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT,
JOHNSON MADE A DRAMATIC TELEVISION APPEARANCE.
AS PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF,
IT IS MY DUTY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REPORT
THAT RENEWED HOSTILE ACTIONS AGAINST UNITED STATES SHIPS
ON THE HIGH SEAS IN THE GULF OF TONKIN
HAVE TODAY REQUIRED ME
TO ORDER THE MILITARY FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES
TO TAKE ACTION IN REPLY.
Johnson:
OUR RESPONSE FOR THE PRESENT
WILL BE LIMITED AND FITTING.
McCullough:
AMERICAN BOMBERS STRIKING DEEP INTO NORTH VIETNAM
DEMONSTRATED THAT JOHNSON WAS A COMMITTED ANTI-COMMUNIST.
Man:
Roger, let's go get 'em.
McCullough:
JOHNSON WOULD USE THIS INCIDENT
TO ACQUIRE THE POWER TO MAKE WAR IN VIETNAM
WHENEVER AND HOWEVER HE WOULD CHOOSE.
JOHNSON ACCUSED THE NORTH VIETNAMESE
OF AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK.
BUT, IN FACT, FOR SIX MONTHS
THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN RUNNING COVERT RAIDS
AGAINST NORTH VIETNAM.
Man:
All hands, man your battle stations...
McCullough:
FINALLY, ON AUGUST 2,
NORTH VIETNAMESE TORPEDO BOATS RETALIATED.
THEY FIRED ON THE U.S. DESTROYER MADDOX
IN THE GULF OF TONKIN.
THE MADDOX RETURNED THE FIRE,
SINKING ONE VIETNAMESE SHIP AND CRIPPLING TWO OTHERS.
Man:
AND WE TOOK THE VIEW WHEN THAT OCCURRED
THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ACTION
OF TRIGGER-HAPPY LOCAL COMMANDERS
AND DID NOT REPRESENT A GOVERNMENTAL POLICY
ON THE PART OF NORTH VIETNAM.
AND SO WE TENDED TO DISREGARD THAT ATTACK.
McCullough:
TWO DAYS AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT,
FEARING THEY WERE ONCE AGAIN UNDER ATTACK,
ANXIOUS SAILORS ON THE MADDOX FIRED THEIR WEAPONS
INTO A DARK, MOONLESS NIGHT.
THEIR UNEASY COMMANDER BEGAN SENDING CABLES
BACK TO THE PENTAGON.
ON AUGUST 4, I BEGAN READING A KIND OF CABLE
THAT ONE VERY RARELY SAW IN THE PENTAGON
AND THAT I DON'T...
I VERY RARELY SAW AGAIN.
THESE WERE OPERATIONAL CABLES.
McCullough:
DANIEL ELLSBERG,
HIS SECOND DAY ON DUTY IN THE PENTAGON,
FOUND HIMSELF READING THIS REMARKABLE SERIES
OF TOP-SECRET MESSAGES FROM THE GULF OF TONKIN.
THESE WERE OPERATIONAL CABLES COMING IN ON A FLASH BASIS,
A VERY SPECIAL HANDLING, ABOUT AN OPERATION THAT WAS GOING ON
AT THAT MOMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD.
THE CABLES SAID, "WE ARE UNDER ATTACK AT THIS MOMENT.
"WE HAVE JUST SUCCESSFULLY EVADED ONE TORPEDO.
"I AM TAKING EVASIVE ACTION.
NOW TWO TORPEDOES."
NOW ANOTHER CABLE: "FOUR TORPEDOES ARE IN THE WATER.
"SIX TORPEDOES ARE IN THE WATER.
"WE HAVE 21 TORPEDOES"-- NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME--
BUT "WE'VE HAD 21 TORPEDOES COMING AT US."
APPARENTLY THE WATER WAS JUST SOWN AND STREWN WITH TORPEDOES.
McCullough:
AS SOON AS THE TONKIN CABLES
WERE RELAYED TO THE WHITE HOUSE, JOHNSON PREPARED TO RETALIATE.
AND THEN SUDDENLY A CABLE CAME IN THAT WAS A WARNING BELL--
SAID, "REEVALUATION OF THE INFORMATION WE'RE GETTING HERE
"SUGGESTS THAT FREAK WEATHER EFFECTS
"AND AN OVEREAGER SONARMAN MAY HAVE ACCOUNTED
"FOR MOST OF THE REPORTS WE'VE BEEN GETTING.
RECOMMEND FULL EVALUATION BEFORE ANY ACTION IS TAKEN."
JUST AS SOON AS WE STARTED TO GET INCOHERENT MESSAGES
THAT HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER, I BEGAN TO FEEL A COLD CHILL--
"HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE."
McCullough:
THE COMMANDER OF THE MADDOX WAS STILL DOUBTFUL.
WERE ANY NORTH VIETNAMESE BOATS EVER OUT THERE THAT DARK NIGHT?
AT DAYBREAK, RECONNAISSANCE PLANES SCANNED THE OCEAN
FOR A SLICK OF OIL, A STICK OF WOOD,
ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE EVIDENCE OF A NORTH VIETNAMESE ATTACK.
NOTHING COULD BE FOUND.
THE EVIDENCE WAS INCONCLUSIVE, BUT JOHNSON WENT AHEAD ANYWAY
AND ORDERED THE FIRST BOMBING RAIDS ON NORTH VIETNAM.
RETALIATION AFTER TONKIN WENT ON FOR NEARLY FIVE HOURS.
ONE PILOT WAS KILLED, ANOTHER CAPTURED.
NO ONE KNEW HOW MANY NORTH VIETNAMESE WERE KILLED.
THE NEXT DAY, JOHNSON PRESENTED HIS VERSION OF THE INCIDENT.
ON AUGUST 2, THE UNITED STATES DESTROYER MADDOX WAS ATTACKED
ON THE HIGH SEAS IN THE GULF OF TONKIN.
McCullough:
FACING A HUGE BANNER
THAT PROCLAIMED "SYRACUSE LOVES L.B.J.,"
THE PRESIDENT WAS CAREFUL NOT TO REVEAL THE WHOLE STORY.
ON AUGUST 4, THAT ATTACK WAS REPEATED.
Ellsberg:
HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN
THAT ON THE WHOLE WE THINK THAT THERE PROBABLY WAS AN ATTACK
TO WHICH WE WERE RETALIATING.
THEY SAID INSTEAD, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS,
THERE WAS AN UNEQUIVOCAL ATTACK UPON OUR SHIPS, WHICH WAS A LIE,
AND IT WAS UNPROVOKED.
THE ATTACKS WERE DELIBERATE.
THE ATTACKS WERE UNPROVOKED.
Ellsberg:
THAT, TOO, WAS A LIE.
WE WERE RUNNING RAIDS AGAINST NORTH VIETNAM,
WHICH THE NORTH VIETNAMESE CORRECTLY ASSOCIATED
WITH THE DESTROYER PATROLS.
McCullough:
JOHNSON CALLED IN CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS
FOR A BRIEFING.
WELL, AS I RECALL IT, HE HAD ME AND A NUMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
DOWN TO THE WHITE HOUSE
AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS TERRIBLY UNPROVOKED ATTACK--
"WE WERE VERY PEACEABLY GOING ABOUT OUR BUSINESS
"AND WITHOUT PROVOCATION THEY ATTACKED US,
SENT OUT THESE GUNBOATS, YOU KNOW, AND SURROUNDED US."
AND THEY EVEN HAD A LITTLE SHELL--
THIS IS EVIDENCE--
"IT HAD FALLEN ON THE DECK OF ONE OF OUR SHIPS."
IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME TO THINK HE WAS LYING ABOUT IT
OR MISREPRESENTING.
I SWALLOWED IT.
IT WAS A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE I DISCOVERED I HAD BEEN TAKEN IN.
McCullough:
FEW AMERICANS QUESTIONED
THE PRESIDENT'S VERSION OF EVENTS.
WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DARK NIGHT HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD
ONLY BECAME APPARENT LATER.
Man:
JOHNSON TOLD ME IN SOME DISGUST
THAT THOSE DAMN SAILORS WERE SHOOTING AT A LOT OF FLYING FISH
AND THEY OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.
HE NEVER THOUGHT-
- WELL, HE BELIEVED AT FIRST
BUT THEN HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT,
THAT THIS HAD BEEN...
THEY'D JUST BEEN SEEING SHADOWS.
McCullough:
JOHNSON NEVER ASKED CONGRESS TO DECLARE WAR.
INSTEAD, HE USED THE INCIDENT
TO CUT HIMSELF LOOSE FROM CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL.
HE REQUESTED A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD GIVE HIM THE POWER
TO EXPAND THE WAR WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION.
AFTER DELIBERATING JUST 40 MINUTES,
THE HOUSE APPROVED THE TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION.
NOT A SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE VOTED NO.
OVER IN THE SENATE, THERE WERE JUST TWO DISSENTING VOTES.
ON AUGUST 7, JOHNSON SIGNED THE RESOLUTION.
THE LANGUAGE WAS BROAD, THE AUTHORITY SWEEPING.
JOHNSON WAS HEARD TO SAY, "IT'S LIKE GRANDMOTHER'S NIGHTSHIRT--
IT COVERS EVERYTHING."
Clifford:
IT WAS ABOUT AS CLOSE TO A DECLARATION OF WAR
AS ONE COULD GET.
THAT STARTED US DOWN THE LONG ROAD OF VIETNAM.
( applause )
McCullough:
JUST THREE WEEKS AFTER JOHNSON SIGNED
THE TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION,
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HELD ITS NOMINATING CONVENTION
IN ATLANTIC CITY.
Man:
ONE HAS TO REMEMBER THAT THE CANDIDATE RUNNING
AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON WAS BARRY GOLDWATER.
AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION
WAS ESSENTIALLY AN ELECTION RESOLUTION.
IT WAS AIMED AT GOLDWATER AND AIMED AT THE RIGHT WING.
I THINK MOST OF THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS IN CONGRESS
THOUGHT THAT.
IT WAS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT LYNDON JOHNSON WAS PREPARED
TO BE AS TOUGH AS ANYBODY COULD BE
AND THEREFORE TAKE SOME OF THE WIND
OUT OF THE SAILS OF A RIGHT-WING CANDIDATE.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION.
( cheering )
McCullough:
WHEN HE WON HIS RACE FOR THE SENATE
WITH A TAINTED 87 VOTES,
HE WAS DOGGED BY THE NICKNAME "LANDSLIDE LYNDON."
WHEN THE MURDER OF A BELOVED PRESIDENT
PUT HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
HE WAS SCORNED AS AN ACCIDENTAL PRESIDENT.
IN NOVEMBER OF 1964, LYNDON JOHNSON WANTED A VICTORY
TO WASH ALL THOSE MEMORIES AWAY.
Johnson:
I ASK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR A MANDATE
NOT JUST TO KEEP THINGS GOING.
I ASK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR A MANDATE TO BEGIN.
( applause )
LET US BE ON OUR WAY!
♫HELLO, LYNDON♫
♫WELL, HELLO, LYNDON♫
♫IT'S JUST GREAT TO HAVE YOU THERE WHERE YOU BELONG♫
♫YOU'RE LOOKING...♫
McCullough:
FROM THE BEGINNING, JOHNSON WAS FAR AHEAD,
AND THE LEAD INSPIRED HIM.
HE EXCITED THE CROWDS AND RELISHED THEIR ARDOR.
"LOOK AT THEM," HE WOULD SAY, "JUST LOOK AT THEM."
HERE IN THE FACES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
WAS THE LOVE AND AFFECTION HE WAS ALWAYS SEEKING.
Kearns:
THE GREAT MAJORITY FELT
THAT LYNDON JOHNSON WAS SAFE, SECURE.
EVERYBODY WAS WITH LYNDON JOHNSON,
EXCEPT FOR, AS HE COULD SAY, "THE KOOKS,"
WHO WERE WITH GOLDWATER.
JOHNSON, I'M NOT SURE, COULD EVER ACCEPT
THAT THERE WAS A GROUP OUT THERE THAT WASN'T GOING TO LIKE HIM.
HE WANTED TO WIN OVER EVERYBODY IF HE POSSIBLY COULD.
Woman:
UNDERNEATH IT ALL, HE WAS VERY INSECURE,
EASILY HURT OR AFFRONTED.
WHENEVER HE RAN FOR OFFICE, HE BROKE OUT IN SPOTS.
HE HAD A KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ECZEMA THAT HE GOT.
Wilkins:
I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE ONE DAY,
AND JOHNSON PUT HIS ARM AROUND ME AND SAID,
"WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.
"I'VE GOT-
- I NEED NEW YORK.
"YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN NEW YORK.
YOU WERE RAISED UP IN MICHIGAN."
HOW HE KNEW I WAS RAISED IN MICHIGAN I'LL NEVER KNOW.
"I WANT YOUR HELP IN MICHIGAN.
WHAT OTHER STATES DO YOU KNOW?"
SO LATER I TALKED TO A GUY, A TEXAN WHOM I KNEW
WHO WAS CLOSE TO JOHNSON, AND I DESCRIBED THIS
AND I SAID, "CRAIG, HE'S WAY AHEAD.
"THE POLLS SHOW HE'S GOING TO DESTROY GOLDWATER.
"WHAT'S HE DOING THIS WITH ME FOR?
WHAT DOES HE WANT?"
AND CRAIG LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "HE WANTS IT ALL."
♫...
THAT HE'S THE ONE♫
♫THE WHOLE WORLD SAYS THAT HE'S THE ONE♫
♫THE WHOLE DARN WORLD AGREES THAT HE'S THE ONE.♫
McCullough:
JOHNSON PAINTED HIS REPUBLICAN RIVAL
AS INSENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF MINORITIES AND THE POOR.
IT WASN'T HARD TO MAKE THE CHARGES STICK.
MINORITY GROUPS RUN THIS COUNTRY,
AND JUST FACE UP TO IT.
AND I MUST BE HONEST ENOUGH TO SAY
I DON'T SEE HOW ANY NEGRO OR WHITE PERSON OF SELF-RESPECT
CAN VOTE FOR MR. GOLDWATER.
( cheering )
I'M RONALD REAGAN.
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HEAR
WHAT BARRY GOLDWATER REALLY HAS TO SAY,
NOT WHAT A BUNCH OF DISTORTERS OF THE TRUTH
WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE.
THIS COUNTRY, MY FRIENDS, MUST ALWAYS MAINTAIN
SUCH SUPERIORITY OF STRENGTH,
SUCH DEVASTATING STRIKE-BACK POWER...
McCullough:
GOLDWATER FRIGHTENED MANY AMERICANS
WITH TALK ABOUT USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
...CREATING SUICIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR SOCIETY
IF THEY PUSH THE BUTTON.
ONE...
TWO...
McCullough:
THE JOHNSON STAFF DEVISED A COMMERCIAL
THAT CAPTURED EVERYBODY'S NIGHTMARE.
FIVE...
SEVEN...
McCullough:
IT WAS SO CONTROVERSIAL,
THEY RAN IT ONLY ONE TIME.
EIGHT...
NINE...
NINE...
Man:
Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... zero.
Johnson:
THESE ARE THE STAKES:
TO MAKE A WORLD IN WHICH ALL OF GOD'S CHILDREN CAN LIVE
OR TO GO INTO THE DARK.
WE MUST EITHER LOVE EACH OTHER
OR WE MUST DIE.
Announcer:
VOTE FOR PRESIDENT JOHNSON ON NOVEMBER 3.
THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH FOR YOU TO STAY HOME.
McCullough:
JOHNSON PRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE PEACE CANDIDATE.
HE PROMISED HE WOULD NEVER SEND AMERICAN BOYS
TO FIGHT IN VIETNAM.
HE NEVER WANTED VIETNAM TO BECOME A CAMPAIGN ISSUE.
"IF YOU HAVE A MOTHER-IN-LAW WITH ONLY ONE EYE,
AND SHE HAS IT IN THE CENTER OF HER FOREHEAD," HE SAID,
"YOU DON'T KEEP HER IN THE LIVING ROOM."
♫HELLO, LYNDON...♫
McCullough:
ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION
JOHNSON WAITED, HE SAID, "FOR THE MOMENT
THAT I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE GETTING READY FOR."
Kearns:
HE COULDN'T TAKE ANY PLEASURE, OBVIOUSLY,
OUT OF BECOMING PRESIDENT BECAUSE JOHN KENNEDY HAD DIED,
BUT NOW SUDDENLY AS HE SAW IT HE COULD PICTURE, HE WOULD TELL ME,
EVERYBODY GOING INTO THE VOTING BOOTH, PULLING THE LEVER
OR WRITING AN "X" FOR HIM,
AND I THINK HE REALLY MEANT "THEY LOVE ME."
IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO DEFEAT GOLDWATER BY A HUGE LANDSLIDE.
HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, IF IT HAD BEEN 90% TO 10%
WHY THOSE OTHER 10% HADN'T BEEN PERSUADED.
McCullough:
"MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE,"
HE WOULD LATER SAY,
"EACH MARKING MY NAME ON THEIR BALLOT.
"EACH WANTED ME AS THEIR PRESIDENT.
"FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALL MY LIFE
I TRULY FELT LOVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."
THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN,
JOHNSON HAD KEPT AMERICANS IGNORANT ABOUT VIETNAM.
BUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,
HE AND HIS ADVISORS HAD BEEN MAKING DECISIONS
THAT WOULD LEAD THE NATION DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO WAR.
I WAS PRESENT AT A MEETING IN AUGUST '64
WITH THE SECRETARIES OF STATE, DEFENSE AND OTHERS,
WITH THE PRESIDENT,
AT WHICH THE PRESIDENT ISSUED MARCHING ORDERS
FOR WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING WHILE HE WAS OUT CAMPAIGNING.
WHAT HE WANTED TO HAVE AVAILABLE FOR HIM
WHEN HE RETURNED-- VICTORIOUS, WE HOPED--
WAS AS WIDE A RANGE OF OPTIONS
AS TO HOW VIETNAM SHOULD BE COPED WITH AS POSSIBLE.
DO WE HAVE TO ESCALATE THE WAR?
DO WE HAVE TO ATTACK NORTH VIETNAM?
DO WE HAVE TO SEND TROOPS?
CAN THIS REGIME IN SAIGON HOLD ITSELF TOGETHER?
NOT TOTALLY COLLAPSE, NOT DEFECT EN MASSE?
CAN WE AVOID DEFEAT IN VIETNAM ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER MONTH?
CAN WE HOLD VIETNAM TOGETHER
WITHOUT ENLARGING THE WAR ENORMOUSLY TILL THE ELECTION?
Johnson:
I, LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON, DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE OFFICE
OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES...
Justice:
AND WILL TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY...
McCullough:
IT WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED VICTORY:
THE PRESIDENCY BY MORE VOTES THAN ANY MAN EVER BEFORE,
THE CONGRESS BY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY,
AND WITH POLITICAL POWER, AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO GREAT THINGS.
NO LONGER A SCORNED AND FRUSTRATED VICE-PRESIDENT...
NO LONGER AN ACCIDENTAL PRESIDENT...
LYNDON JOHNSON WAS NOW ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PRESIDENTS
OF THE CENTURY.
ON THE NIGHT OF HIS INAUGURAL GALA,
JOHNSON TOLD HIS GUESTS, "DON'T STAY UP LATE.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE GREAT SOCIETY."
ON JANUARY 20, 1965,
THERE WAS NO HINT THAT JOHNSON'S GREAT SOCIETY
WAS ABOUT TO BE OVERWHELMED BY A FULL-SCALE LAND WAR IN ASIA,
THAT LYNDON JOHNSON HAD ALREADY SOWN THE SEEDS
OF HIS OWN DESTRUCTION.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS...
I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION.
( cheering, applause )
McCullough:
THE 1964 CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN AN ABSOLUTE TRIUMPH.
JOHNSON HAD BEEN EXHILARATED BY THE ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS.
Johnson:
I WANT FOR EVERY FAMILY WHAT MY MOTHER WANTED FOR ME:
THE CHANCE FOR AN HONEST LIVING, AN HONORABLE JOB,
A DECENT FUTURE.
McCullough:
HE HAD GALVANIZED THE NATION
WITH HIS APPEAL FOR RACIAL JUSTICE
AND HIS VISION OF A GREAT SOCIETY.
AT THE SAME TIME, HE HAD PROMISED
NOT TO SEND AMERICAN TROOPS TO FIGHT IN VIETNAM.
Johnson:
I HAVE HAD ADVICE
TO LOAD OUR PLANES WITH BOMBS
AND TO DROP THEM ON CERTAIN AREAS
THAT I THINK WOULD ENLARGE THE WAR
AND ESCALATE THE WAR
AND RESULT IN OUR COMMITTING A GOOD MANY AMERICAN BOYS
TO FIGHTING A WAR
THAT I THINK OUGHT TO BE FOUGHT BY THE BOYS OF ASIA
TO HELP PROTECT THEIR OWN LAND.
McCullough:
BUT IN VIETNAM, THE FIGHTING WENT ON.
EVEN WITH AMERICAN ADVISORS,
THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARMY COULDN'T WIN THE WAR THEMSELVES.
JOHNSON KNEW THEY WOULD NEED MORE HELP.
"IT'S GOING TO HELL IN A HAND BASKET OUT THERE,"
JOHNSON HAD TOLD AN AIDE.
"THE ARMY WON'T FIGHT;
THE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHOSE SIDE TO BE ON."
FOR MONTHS, HIS ADVISORS WERE WARNING HIM
THAT IF HE DIDN'T ACT, SOUTH VIETNAM WOULD FALL.
JOHNSON'S VISION FOR AMERICA WAS ABOUT TO CONVERGE
WITH A LAND WAR IN ASIA.
ON ELECTION DAY, I REPRESENTED THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
IN AN INTERAGENCY MEETING AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT
UNDER WILLIAM BUNDY, CONSIDERING, ESSENTIALLY,
ALTERNATIVE BOMBING PROGRAMS AGAINST NORTH VIETNAM.
WE DIDN'T WAIT TILL THE DAY AFTER ELECTION
BECAUSE VIETNAM COULDN'T WAIT.
WE JUST BARELY MADE IT TO THE ELECTION WITHOUT BOMBING.
McCullough:
"WE DON'T WANT TO GET TIED DOWN IN A LAND WAR,"
JOHNSON TOLD AN AIDE.
THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORS GAVE HIM THREE CHOICES.
Man:
ONE WAS TO GO ON AS WE WERE DOING,
ACCEPTING THAT IT MIGHT READILY BE
THAT THAT SIMPLY WOULDN'T DO THE TRICK.
THEN WE HAD TWO OPTIONS THAT WERE...
IN EFFECT DIFFERED IN THEIR PACE, IN THEIR SEVERITY:
OPTION "B", WHICH WOULD HAVE BOMBED VERY HEAVILY,
OR FAIRLY HEAVILY,
AND OPTION "C", WHICH WAS A MORE GRADUATED BOMBING PROGRAM.
WE DIDN'T REALLY CONSIDER NOT BOMBING NORTH VIETNAM.
THAT POSSIBILITY WAS MENTIONED, BUT ONLY AS A STRAW MAN--
THERE LIES DEFEAT;
NO ONE IS FOR THAT.
JOHNSON'S ADVISORS WANTED TO GET US MOVING ON THE BOMBING.
THE PRESIDENT WAS DIGGING IN HIS FEET ON THAT.
HE HAD TO BE CONVINCED THAT THAT WAS WORTHWHILE.
IT GAVE ME A VERY GOOD IMPRESSION OF JOHNSON.
I HAD, IN FACT, THE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE ONLY SANE MAN
AT THAT LEVEL OF THE GOVERNMENT,
THAT HE WAS ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.
( jet engine roars )
McCullough:
ON FEBRUARY 6, 1965,
JOHNSON ORDERED THE BOMBING OF NORTH VIETNAM
IN RETALIATION FOR A VIETCONG ATTACK
ON AN AMERICAN MILITARY OUTPOST.
THE OPTION HE CHOSE SEEMED TO THE PRESIDENT, I'M SURE,
TO BE THE OPTION OF RESTRAINT.
( explosion )
RATHER THAN BE COWARDLY, RATHER THAN BE A TERRIBLE RISK TAKER,
HE WOULD APPLY GRADUATED PRESSURES.
Valenti:
WELL, IT'S LIKE THE FIRST OLIVE OUT OF A BOTTLE.
ONCE THAT HAPPENS, THE OTHER OLIVES ARE EASIER TO GET OUT.
SO ONCE YOU STARTED BOMBING, THEN IT BECAME A NORMALITY.
( explosion )
ALWAYS "A LITTLE BIT MORE, A LITTLE BIT MORE
AND WE CAN GET THIS WAR BEHIND US."
McCullough:
IN MARCH JOHNSON ORDERED CONTINUOUS
AND MASSIVE AIR ASSAULTS
AGAINST NORTH VIETNAM-- OPERATION "ROLLING THUNDER."
( explosions )
"I KNEW," HE LATER WROTE, "THAT WE WERE AT A TURNING POINT."
EACH STEP WAS MAKING IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT
FOR JOHNSON TO TURN BACK.
Thomson:
I THINK PRESIDENT JOHNSON
HAD A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
TO GET US OUT OF VIETNAM AFTER THE ELECTION OF 1964.
JOHNSON HAD WON OVERWHELMINGLY;
HE HAD PROMISED NOT TO SEND AMERICAN BOYS TO DIE THERE;
HE HAD THE MANDATE AND HE HAD FOUR YEARS TO DO IT.
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE THE ADVICE.
McCullough:
FOR EVERY DECISION, JOHNSON HAD HAD THE COUNSEL
OF THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST IN AMERICA--
MEN LIKE ROBERT McNAMARA
AND DEAN RUSK, HOLDOVERS FROM THE KENNEDY ERA;
"HARVARDS," JOHNSON CALLED THEM.
HE WAS THE GRADUATE
OF SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE TEACHER'S COLLEGE.
Janeway:
HE LABORED HIS LIFE LONG
UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT HE WAS BRANDED FOR LIFE
BECAUSE HE HAD NO FORMAL EDUCATION.
THEY HAD GONE TO HARVARD, AND ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOLS
AND HERE WAS HE, AND I DON'T THINK HE EVER FINISHED READING
A POPULAR PAMPHLET PAST PAGE ONE.
Ball:
I'M SURE THE FACT THAT HE WAS GETTING THIS INFORMATION
FROM PEOPLE WITH SUCH ELEGANT EDUCATIONS
WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HIM.
IT JUSTIFIED HIS OWN DECISIONS.
( explosion )
McCullough:
THE PRESIDENT HOPED THE BOMBING
WOULD FORCE NORTH VIETNAM TO THE BARGAINING TABLE.
JOHNSON HAD NO LOVE FOR WHAT HE CALLED "THAT BITCH OF A WAR."
"THE WOMAN I REALLY LOVED," HE SAID,
"WAS THE GREAT SOCIETY."
Newsreel announcer:
MR. JOHNSON PROPOSES AN EDUCATION PROGRAM
THAT WILL ENSURE EVERY AMERICAN
FULL DEVELOPMENT OF HIS MIND AND SKILLS.
HE SAYS THE BEAUTY OF AMERICA MUST BE PRESERVED
AS A GREEN LEGACY, WITH WATER AND AIR POLLUTION ENDED.
BEAUTY OF MIND, TOO, MUST BE PROMOTED.
CITIES SHOULD BE IMAGINATIVELY IMPROVED
AND A BROAD HEALTH PROGRAM MUST ENSURE MEDICAL CARE
FOR THE AGED AND NEEDY.
McCullough:
IT WAS A LEGISLATIVE AVALANCHE.
NO PRESIDENT HAD EVER PUT SO MANY BILLS BEFORE CONGRESS.
HISTORY WILL PROVE
THAT HE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE PRESIDENT
WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
WHETHER YOU LIKED HIM OR WHETHER YOU APPROVED
OF HIS TACTICS OR WHAT WAS ACTUALLY PASSED,
AS FAR AS GETTING THINGS DONE,
JOHNSON COULD DO IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY.
Reedy:
WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT,
HE DECIDED THAT HE HAD TO GET EVERYTHING DONE AT ONCE
BECAUSE HE HAD CHECKED BACK.
HE DISCOVERED THAT ALL THE THINGS PRESIDENTS DID
THEY DID DURING THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS,
AND SO HE BEGAN TO PUMP THINGS OUT FRANTICALLY.
Kearns Goodwin:
THERE WAS A SENSE IN WHICH LAWS WERE BEING WRITTEN
BEFORE PEOPLE EVEN UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEMS
AND YOU HAD NEW AGENCIES SPRINGING UP OVERNIGHT.
BUT I THINK JOHNSON WAS AFRAID THAT SOMEHOW THIS CONSENSUS
WAS GOING TO GO AWAY, SO HE BETTER GET AS MUCH DONE
AS HE COULD AND WE CAN STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT LATER.
McCullough:
JOHNSON PREPARED BILL AFTER BILL:
FUNDS FOR EDUCATION--
ELEMENTARY, SECONDARY AND COLLEGE
AND FOR PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN, HEADSTART;
FUNDS FOR CONSERVATION, CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN RIVERS,
HIGHWAY BEAUTIFICATION, NATIONAL PARKS;
FUNDS FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION, TRUTH IN LABELING AND PACKAGING;
AUTOMOBILE SAFETY.
THERE WAS URBAN RENEWAL AND HOUSING,
PUBLIC TELEVISION,
THE CREATION OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES
AND THE ARTS.
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.
Johnson:
AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET.
Connally:
I THOUGHT HE PASSED TOO MUCH LEGISLATION.
HE WAS PASSING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER
WITHOUT ADEQUATE HEARINGS,
WITHOUT A BASIC UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS WERE GOING TO BE
AND HOW THEY WERE GOING TO BE ADMINISTERED.
Johnson:
I HAVE HAD BUT ONE OBJECTIVE:
TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE--
NOT JUST THE RICH, NOT JUST THE WELL-FED,
NOT JUST THE FORTUNATE,
BUT PRESIDENT OF ALL OF AMERICA.
( applause )
Connally:
HE WAS INORDINATELY PROUD
OF ALL THIS LEGISLATION HE PASSED.
WELL, I MEAN, HE KEPT A SCORECARD IN HIS POCKET,
HAD A SHEET OF PAPER, AND HE LISTED
ALL THE LEGISLATION HE'D PASSED.
HE WAS EXTREMELY PROUD OF IT.
( applause )
Cater:
HE WANTED TO DO GOOD THINGS.
HE WANTED TO DO GREAT THINGS.
AND HE HAD GROWN UP IN A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT,
WHICH WAS THE AMERICAN SYSTEM,
IN WHICH YOU DID THINGS
BY WHEELING AND DEALING AND TRADING.
THIS WAS THE WAY YOU DID IT.
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WORKS THIS WAY ANYMORE,
BUT WHEN I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT ASSIGNED ME
CERTAIN SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN "TO HANDLE."
EVERY NOW AND THEN, EVERETT DIRKSEN WOULD CALL.
HE WAS THE REPUBLICAN LEADER.
AND HE WOULD SAY, "JACK..."
HE HAD A VOICE THAT WAS LIKE HONEY DRIPPING OVER METAL TILES
AND HE'D SAY, "JACK, I WANT TO SEE THE BOSS LATER ON TODAY
AND MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A DRINK AND TALK ABOUT A FEW THINGS."
I'D SAY, "YES, SIR, SENATOR.
THE PRESIDENT WILL SEE YOU AT 6:00," I'D SAY.
"YES, THAT WOULD BE FINE."
THEN HE WOULD RISE IN THE SENATE ABOUT 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON
AND ACCUSE JOHNSON OF EVERY CRIME
THAT THE MOST DEPRAVED MIND COULD BE CAPABLE OF COMMITTING.
AND THEN AT 6:00 HE'D SHOW UP,
AND I'D GO UP WITH HIM TO THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE MANSION,
AND WE'D SIT AND TALK AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY,
"EVERETT, I WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT A CUR DOG
THE WAY YOU DID ME IN THE SENATE."
"WELL," HE SAID, "MR. PRESIDENT, I VOWED TO TELL THE TRUTH,
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE."
THEN THEY WOULD LAUGH
AND THEN THEY WOULD RECOUNT SOME OLD, LONG-FOUGHT BATTLES,
AND THEN, FINALLY, THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY,
"NOW, EVERETT, I'VE GOT TO HAVE THREE REPUBLICAN VOTES
"AND YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
"I'VE GOT TO HAVE THOSE VOTES, EVERETT,
AND I DON'T WANT ANY BEATING AROUND THE BUSH ABOUT IT."
AND DIRKSEN WOULD SAY, "MR. PRESIDENT, I HAPPEN TO HAVE HERE
"SOME NAMES OF SOME LIKELY NOMINEES
"TO THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
"AND THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION
AND A FEW OTHER COMMISSIONS."
THE PRESIDENT SAID, "WELL, GIVE THEIR NAMES TO VALENTI HERE.
"WE'LL CHECK THEM OUT WITH THE F.B.I.
AND SEE IF THEY'RE FIT TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY."
AND THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER DRINK.
AND THERE WAS NO SUMMARY OF THE MEETING GIVEN.
EACH OF THEM KNEW THAT JOHNSON WAS GOING TO GET
THREE REPUBLICAN VOTES AND DIRKSEN KNEW HE WAS GOING TO GET
THREE NOMINEES TO COMMISSIONS.
I DON'T KNOW THEY TEACH THAT IN GOVERNMENT 101
IN ANY OF THE SCHOOLS, BUT IT WORKED.
THE PRESIDENT GOT DONE WHAT HE NEEDED TO HAVE DONE.
BUT THE TELEPHONE WAS HIS EXCALIBUR.
IT WAS HIS SWORD.
NO CONGRESSMAN WAS TOO MUCH OF A ROOKIE TO BE CALLED
NOR TOO POWERFUL A ONE TO BE IMPORTUNED.
Cater:
ONE MORNING AT 5:00 A.M., HE WOKE UP A SENATOR
AND SAID, "HI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
AND HE SAID, "OH, NOTHING, MR. PRESIDENT,
JUST LYING HERE, HOPING YOU'D CALL."
IF A CONGRESSMAN WASN'T HOME, HE'D TALK TO THE WIFE.
AND IF THE WIFE WASN'T HOME, HE'D TALK TO THE CHILDREN
AND TOLD THEM TO TELL THEIR DADDY TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.
Connally:
PART OF HIS DEMEANOR, PART OF HIS WHOLE LIFE
WAS THAT HE FELT HE COULD CONVERT ANYBODY,
THAT HE COULD CONVERT AN ENEMY INTO A FRIEND,
THAT HE WOULD WORK AT IT ASSIDUOUSLY TO COURT
AND TO CONVERT SOMEONE WHO DISLIKED HIM
INTO BEING A FRIEND AND A DISCIPLE.
AND MANY TIMES IT WORKED.
McCullough:
BUT JOHNSON COULDN'T USE THOSE SAME TACTICS
WITH HO CHI MINH.
JOHNSON THOUGHT THE WAR WOULD BE LIKE A FILIBUSTER, AS HE SAID--
ENORMOUS RESISTANCE AT FIRST, THEN A STEADY WHITTLING AWAY,
THEN HO HURRYING TO GET IT OVER WITH.
Berman:
HO CHI MINH WAS A REVOLUTIONARY.
JOHNSON DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND REVOLUTIONARIES.
A REVOLUTIONARY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE LIKE HO CHI MINH.
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY
OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, THE VIETNAMESE CULTURE.
( explosion )
McCullough:
JOHNSON THOUGHT HE COULD FORCE
HO CHI MINH TO BARGAIN.
"I SAW OUR BOMBS AS POLITICAL RESOURCES
FOR NEGOTIATING PEACE," HE SAID.
BUT HO COULDN'T BE PUSHED.
THEIR POSITIONS WERE IRRECONCILABLE.
HO CALLED THE AMERICANS INVADERS.
JOHNSON CALLED NORTH VIETNAM THE AGGRESSOR,
WAGING WAR ON A PEACEFUL NEIGHBOR.
JOHNSON WANTED TWO COUNTRIES, A NORTH AND A SOUTH VIETNAM.
HO WANTED ONE.
( explosions )
HO CHI MINH AND THE COMMUNISTS HAD NO INTENTION WHATSOEVER
OF EVER ALLOWING A PEACE TREATY TO SEPARATE THEIR COUNTRY.
TIME WAS ON THEIR SIDE.
THEY COULD CERTAINLY WAIT OUT LYNDON JOHNSON.
( shouting )
HE UNDERSTOOD HO CHI MINH TO BE
LIKE ANY OTHER POLITICAL ADVERSARY
WHO HE COULD BROKER WITH, HE COULD DEAL WITH;
THAT HO CHI MINH HAD A PRICE, AND HE WOULD FIND THAT PRICE.
Johnson:
WELL, WHAT DO THE PEOPLE OF NORTH VIETNAM WANT?
FOOD FOR THEIR HUNGER, HEALTH FOR THEIR BODIES.
I WILL ASK THE CONGRESS
TO JOIN IN A BILLION-DOLLAR AMERICAN INVESTMENT
TO REPLACE DESPAIR WITH HOPE AND TERROR WITH PROGRESS.
( explosion )
McCullough:
JOHNSON WOULD BULLY AND BARGAIN.
ON APRIL 7, HE OFFERED HO
WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT SOCIETY PROGRAM.
THE VAST MEKONG RIVER CAN PROVIDE FOOD AND WATER AND POWER
ON A SCALE TO DWARF EVEN OUR OWN T.V.A.
THE WONDERS OF MODERN MEDICINE CAN BE SPREAD THROUGH VILLAGES
WHERE THOUSANDS DIE EVERY YEAR.
SCHOOLS CAN BE ESTABLISHED TO TRAIN PEOPLE...
Valenti:
AND I REMEMBER ONE TIME I TRAILED HIM INTO HIS OFFICE
AND HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
AND PUT HIS HANDS ON HIS HEAD LIKE THIS
AND HE SAID, "OH, GOD, HOW CAN WE GET OUT OF THIS WAR?
HE SAID, "IF I COULD SIT IN A ROOM WITH HO CHI MINH,
TALK TO HIM, I THINK WE COULD CUT A DEAL."
♫WE SHALL OVERCOME...♫
McCullough:
AT THE SAME TIME JOHNSON WAS CHALLENGING HO,
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS CONTINUING
TO CHALLENGE THE SOUTH.
DESPITE JOHNSON'S HISTORIC CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964
THAT HAD PUT AN END TO SEGREGATION, A WEB OF LOCAL LAWS
CONTINUED TO DENY BLACK AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
ABOUT 192 NEGROES WERE REGISTERED
ON THE AVERAGE, A MONTH, IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI;
ALL OVER THE STATE, 192 A MONTH.
NOW, ON THE BASIS OF THIS RATE OF REGISTRATION,
IT WOULD TAKE EXACTLY 135 YEARS
FOR HALF OF THE NEGROES ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN MISSISSIPPI
TO BECOME REGISTERED.
McCullough:
EARLY IN 1965, MARTIN LUTHER KING MET
WITH LYNDON JOHNSON IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
Man:
MARTIN MADE THE CASE
WE WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS
AND RACIAL VIOLENCE UNTIL WE GOT THE VOTE
AND THAT THE RIGHT TO VOTE
WAS SOMETHING WE COULD NOT AFFORD TO WAIT ON.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON SAID
THAT THERE COULD NOT BE A CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN '65
BECAUSE THERE HAD JUST BEEN A CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN '64.
IT WAS JUST NOT IN THE CARDS;
THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE BACK-TO-BACK CIVIL RIGHTS BILLS.
BUT WE FELT LIKE THERE WAS NO CHOICE,
AND SO WE TOLD HIM THEN THAT WE WOULD BE GOING TO SELMA
TO BEGIN NONVIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS
TO TRY TO DRAMATIZE THE NEED FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE
AND THAT WE WOULD STAY IN TOUCH WITH HIM.
McCullough:
DETERMINED TO FORCE JOHNSON'S HAND,
KING, WORKING WITH OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS,
ORGANIZED A SERIES OF DEMONSTRATIONS IN ALABAMA,
CLIMAXING IN A MARCH FROM SELMA
TO THE STATE CAPITOL IN MONTGOMERY.
( shouting )
ALABAMA STATE TROOPERS BRUTALLY ATTACKED THE UNARMED MARCHERS
WHILE TELEVISION CAMERAS RECORDED THE EVENT
FOR A STUNNED NATIONAL AUDIENCE.
( siren blaring )
IT WAS CALLED "BLOODY SUNDAY."
JOHNSON WAS OUTRAGED.
WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, HE SAW IT ALL ON TELEVISION.
BUT HE REFUSED TO SEND FEDERAL TROOPS TO PROTECT THE MARCHERS.
THERE WAS ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON JOHNSON
TO SEND DOWN FEDERAL TROOPS.
HE SAYS THE LAST THING HE WANTED TO DO
WAS TO SEND THE FEDERAL ARMY INTO THE SOUTH.
HE SAID IT WOULD BE LIKE RECONSTRUCTION ALL OVER AGAIN.
HE SAID, "I WOULD LOSE EVERY SOUTHERNER."
McCullough:
JOHNSON SAID HE WAS AFRAID TO PLAY INTO THE HANDS
OF THE POPULAR SEGREGATIONIST GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA,
GEORGE WALLACE, WHO HAD TURNED THE STATE TROOPERS LOOSE
ON THE MARCHERS.
BUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS FORCING JOHNSON TO ACTION.
DEMONSTRATORS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY DEMANDED
THAT JOHNSON PROVIDE FEDERAL PROTECTION
SO THAT THE MARCH COULD GO FORWARD.
King:
NOW THEY'VE BEEN SLOW TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THEY ALWAYS FIND WAYS TO GET OVER TO YOU
THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE.
IT'S STILL STRANGE TO US, THOUGH,
HOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CAN BE SPENT EVERY DAY
TO HOLD TROOPS IN SOUTH VIETNAM
WHEN OUR COUNTRY CANNOT PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF NEGROES
IN SELMA, MARION, ALABAMA.
( applause )
McCullough:
JOHNSON WAS STUNNED BY THE PRESSURE,
BUT REFUSED TO BE PUSHED.
"I WAS HURT, DEEPLY HURT,
BUT I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE SHOVED INTO HASTY ACTION."
Wilkins:
PEOPLE WERE DEMONSTRATING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
IT WAS JUST A GENERAL UPRISING.
THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY UNHAPPY.
DURING THAT WEEK, I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
AND AGAIN, WE MEET HIM.
AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME, HE STARED AT ME
AS IF, "I NEVER SAW THIS PERSON, WHERE DID HE COME FROM?
I'M FURIOUS THAT HE IS IN MY SIGHT."
IT WAS REALLY FRIGHTENING.
I MEAN, HE LOOKED LIKE...
I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING TO HIM.
I SAID, "HELLO, MR. PRESIDENT."
AND HE LOOKED AT ME, AND HE SAID,
"THESE DEMONSTRATIONS-- WHAT ARE THEY ALL ABOUT?"
I SAID, "PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO VOTE, MR. PRESIDENT.
WE REALLY NEED A VOTING RIGHTS ACT."
I WAS KIND OF TREMBLING.
( growling )
AND HE JUST LEFT.
HE DID NOT...
THERE WAS NO WORDS.
NO WORDS CAME OUT, JUST...
( growls )
AT THAT VERY PRECISE MOMENT, FORTUNATELY,
WALLACE SENT A TELEGRAM TO THE WHITE HOUSE
SAYING HE'D LIKE TO MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT
TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION.
JOHNSON SAID, "WELL, YOU JUST COME RIGHT AHEAD."
THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING CONVERSATION
I'VE EVER BEEN PRESENT AT,
BECAUSE HERE WAS LYNDON JOHNSON, THE CONSUMMATE POLITICIAN,
AND GEORGE WALLACE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON
AT THAT MEETING.
WALLACE IS ABOUT FIVE-FOUR AND JOHNSON IS ABOUT SIX-FOUR.
SO HE LEADS WALLACE IN AND HE SITS HIM DOWN
ON THE COUCH.
WALLACE SINKS DOWN, SO HE'S NOW ABOUT THREE FEET TALL.
AND JOHNSON SITS ON THE EDGE OF THE ROCKING CHAIR,
LEANING OVER HIM.
"GEORGE," HE SAID, "DID YOU SEE THOSE DEMONSTRATORS
OUT IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE?"
"OH, YES, MR. PRESIDENT, I SAW THEM."
HE SAID, "WOULDN'T IT BE JUST WONDERFUL
IF WE COULD PUT AN END TO ALL THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS?"
"OH, YES, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL."
HE SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU AND I GO OUT THERE, GEORGE?
"ALL THOSE TELEVISION CAMERAS...
DID YOU SEE THOSE TELEVISION CAMERAS?"
"OH, YES, I SAW THEM."
HE SAYS, "LET'S YOU AND I GO OUT THERE
"AND LET'S ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'VE DECIDED
TO INTEGRATE EVERY SCHOOL IN ALABAMA."
AND HIS SOUTHERN VOICE ALWAYS DEEPENED
WHEN HE SPOKE TO OTHER SOUTHERNERS.
HE SAYS, "YOU AGREE THAT NEGROES
GOT THE RIGHT TO VOTE, DON'T YOU?"
HE SAYS, "OH, YES, MR. PRESIDENT,
THERE'S NO QUARRELING WITH THAT."
HE SAYS, "WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU LET THEM VOTE?"
HE SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW," HE SAID, "I DON'T HAVE THAT POWER.
"THAT BELONGS TO THE COUNTY REGISTRARS
IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA."
JOHNSON LEANED BACK AND HE SAYS, "GEORGE,"
HE SAID, "DON'T YOU SHIT ME AS TO WHO RUNS ALABAMA."
AND WALLACE INSISTED, NO, HE DIDN'T HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY.
HE SAID, "WELL, WHY DON'T YOU PERSUADE THEM, GEORGE."
HE SAID, "I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT."
HE SAID, "NOW, DON'T SHIT ME
ABOUT YOUR PERSUASIVE POWER, GEORGE."
HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW, I SIT DOWN ON THE BED IN THE MORNING
"WHEN I GET UP AND I GOT THREE TV SETS
"LINED ONE RIGHT UP AFTER THE OTHER,
"AND I GOT A LITTLE BUTTON I CAN PRESS
"AND I CLICK AND WHENEVER I SEE SOMETHING I'M INTERESTED IN,
"I PRESS THE BUTTON AND THE SOUND GOES ON.
"I HAD IT ON THIS MORNING
"AND I SAW YOU, AND I PRESSED THE BUTTON.
YOU WERE TALKING...
YOU WAS ATTACKING ME, GEORGE."
HE SAYS, "I WASN'T ATTACKING YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
I WAS ATTACKING THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF STATES' RIGHTS..."
HE SAYS, "YOU WAS ATTACKING ME, GEORGE.
YOU WERE SO DAMN PERSUASIVE, I ALMOST CHANGED MY MIND."
THIS GOES ON FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE,
AND THEN, FINALLY, HE TURNS TO WALLACE AND SAYS,
"GEORGE, YOU AND I SHOULDN'T BE THINKING ABOUT 1964.
"WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT 1984.
"WE'LL BOTH BE DEAD AND GONE THEN.
"YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE DOWN THERE IN ALABAMA,
"A LOT OF IGNORANT PEOPLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED JOBS,
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED A FUTURE."
HE SAID, "YOU COULD DO A LOT FOR THEM."
HE SAYS, "NOW, IN 1984, GEORGE, WHAT DO YOU WANT LEFT BEHIND?
"DO YOU WANT A GREAT BIG MARBLE MONUMENT
"THAT SAYS, 'GEORGE WALLACE-
- HE BUILT'
"OR DO YOU WANT A LITTLE PIECE OF SCRAWNY PINE LAYING THERE
"ALONG THAT HARSH CALICHE SOIL
THAT SAYS 'GEORGE WALLACE-
- HE HATED'?"
McCullough:
IN THE END, WALLACE AGREED TO ASK THE PRESIDENT
TO MOBILIZE THE NATIONAL GUARD TO PROTECT THE MARCHERS.
THE GOVERNOR WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID AFTERWARDS,
"IF I HADN'T LEFT WHEN I DID,
HE'D HAVE HAD ME COMING OUT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS."
TWO DAYS LATER, ON NATIONAL TELEVISION,
JOHNSON PRESENTED A TOUGH VOTING RIGHTS BILL
TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS.
BUT EVEN IF WE PASS THIS BILL, THE BATTLE WILL NOT BE OVER.
WHAT HAPPENED IN SELMA IS PART OF A FAR LARGER MOVEMENT
WHICH REACHES INTO EVERY SECTION AND STATE OF AMERICA.
IT IS THE EFFORT OF AMERICAN NEGROES
TO SECURE FOR THEMSELVES THE FULL BLESSINGS OF AMERICAN LIFE.
THEIR CAUSE MUST BE OUR CAUSE, TOO,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST NEGROES, BUT REALLY IT'S ALL OF US
WHO MUST OVERCOME THE CRIPPLING LEGACY OF BIGOTRY AND INJUSTICE
AND WE SHALL OVERCOME.
( applause )
Chorus:
♫WE SHALL OVERCOME...♫
McCullough:
WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,
THE MARCHERS ASSEMBLED IN THE HEART OF THE OLD SOUTH
TO CLAIM THEIR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Wilkins:
YOU FELT THAT THE PENT-UP NEEDS
AND DESIRES OF YOUR PEOPLE OVER THE GENERATIONS
WERE GOING TO BE ACHIEVED IN YOUR LIFETIME.
ENORMOUS, WHEN YOU THOUGHT OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHO WERE SLAVES.
Chorus:
♫WE SHALL OVERCOME SOMEDAY...♫
WELL, AT THAT POINT, I WAS, LIKE, BONDED TO HIM.
MY TRANSFORMATION AS A HUMAN BEING HAD BEEN COMPLETE.
I BELIEVED BY THEN THAT HE WAS TRULY THE CIVIL RIGHTS PRESIDENT
THAT WE WANTED AND NEEDED.
Chorus:
♫WE SHALL OVERCOME SOMEDAY.♫
( plane engine roaring )
Man 1:
DOORS OPEN AT 30 T.G., COMING UP ON 30 T.G.
Man 2:
30 T.G.
Man 1:
ROGER.
STAND BY TO RELEASE.
READY, READY, NOW.
Man 2:
BOMBS AWAY.
McCullough:
ALL THROUGH EARLY 1965,
BOMBS CONTINUED TO FALL ON NORTH VIETNAM.
Man 1:
READY, READY, NOW.
( explosions )
McCullough:
JOHNSON HAD HOPED
THAT THE MASSIVE AIR STRIKES BY THE B-52s
WOULD HALT THE FLOW OF SUPPLIES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH,
BUT THE BOMBS SEEMED ONLY TO STIFFEN THE RESOLVE
OF HO AND THE NORTH VIETNAMESE.
Man:
TURN NOW.
McCullough:
THE WAR WAS ACQUIRING A MOMENTUM OF ITS OWN
AND A DESPERATE SENSE OF INEVITABILITY.
ON MARCH 8, JOHNSON ORDERED THE FIRST AMERICAN FIGHTING TROOPS
INTO VIETNAM.
THEIR MISSION WAS OFFICIALLY DEFENSIVE--
TO PROTECT THE PLANES THAT WERE BOMBING NORTH VIETNAM.
Reporter:
WHEN THE MARINES FIRST LANDED AT DANANG,
WE WERE TOLD THAT THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEFEND THE AIR BASE.
NOW, HOW DO YOU RESOLVE THAT, SIR,
WITH YOUR STATEMENTS IN SAIGON
THAT THEIR OBJECTIVE IS TO KILL THE VIETCONG?
YOU CAN'T DEFEND
A PLACE LIKE THAT BY SITTING ON YOUR DITTY BOX.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT AND AGGRESSIVELY PATROL
AND THAT'S WHAT OUR PEOPLE ARE DOING.
AND ONE THING I EMPHASIZED TO THEM WHILE I WAS OUT THERE
WAS TO FIND THESE VIETCONG AND KILL THEM.
Man ( on radio ):
I SAW SOME PEOPLE RUNNING ALONG THE DIKES.
ACTUALLY, THE CANAL IS PERPENDICULAR
TO THE ONE YOU'RE ATTACKING NOW.
THEY HAVE ON BLACK UNIFORMS.
I ESTIMATE APPROXIMATELY 3-0.
DO YOU HAVE THEM IN SIGHT?
OVER.
Man 2 ( on radio ):
THIS IS 2-3, ROGER, WE HAVE THEM IN SIGHT.
WE'RE ENGAGING THEM AT THE PRESENT TIME.
Man 3 ( on radio ):
GOOD JOB.
I SAW YOU SPLATTER ONE RIGHT IN THE BACK WITH A ROCKET.
Man 2 ( on radio ):
ROGER.
GOT LUCKY AGAIN.
McCullough:
THE LOGIC OF WAR WAS RELENTLESS.
ADVISORS HAD LED TO BOMBING;
BOMBING NOW LED TO TROOPS.
BY EARLY 1965,
THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS WERE IN VIETNAM
AND STILL THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARMY WAS LOSING.
ON MARCH 15, JOHNSON MET WITH THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF,
AND GENERAL HAROLD K. JOHNSON MADE A PREDICTION
THAT SENT A SHOCK WAVE THROUGH THE ROOM.
"TO WIN THE WAR," HE SAID,
"IT COULD TAKE FIVE YEARS AND 500,000 MEN."
NOW JOHNSON KNEW THE STAKES:
TO KEEP SOUTH VIETNAM FROM FALLING,
HE MIGHT HAVE TO COMMIT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN BOYS
TO A FULL-SCALE LAND WAR IN ASIA.
HE WAS FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE DECISION HE HAD BEEN DREADING.
"IF I DON'T GO IN NOW AND THEY SHOW LATER I SHOULD HAVE GONE,
"THEN THEY'LL BE ALL OVER ME IN CONGRESS.
"THEY WON'T BE TALKING ABOUT MY CIVIL RIGHTS BILL
"OR EDUCATION OR BEAUTIFICATION.
"NO, SIR, THEY'LL BE PUSHING VIETNAM UP MY ASS EVERY TIME--
VIETNAM, VIETNAM, VIETNAM."
Berman:
HOW WOULD JOHNSON EXPLAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THAT THE COUNTRY THAT JOHN KENNEDY HAD PROMISED TO DEFEND,
THAT DWIGHT EISENHOWER HAD PROMISED TO DEFEND,
WASN'T WORTH DEFENDING ANY LONGER?
HAD THE PEOPLE CHANGED?
HAD OUR COMMITMENT TO FREEDOM CHANGED?
OR WAS IT THE FACT
THAT WE COULDN'T DEFEAT THE NORTH VIETNAMESE?
McCullough:
EVERY TUESDAY, JOHNSON HAD LUNCH
WITH HIS PRINCIPAL ADVISORS.
"IF YOU CAN SHOW ME ANY REASONABLE OUT, I'LL GRAB IT,"
HE TOLD THEM.
BUT TO GIVE IN WOULD BE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.
THE LESSONS OF WORLD WAR II
WERE ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF THEIR MINDS--
"STOP AGGRESSION WHEN IT BEGINS"; "NEVER REWARD A BULLY,"
AND THE REAL BULLIES BEHIND HO AND THE NORTH VIETNAMESE,
THEY BELIEVED, WERE THE RUSSIANS AND THE CHINESE.
Thomson:
THE MEN AT THE TOP DID NOT WANT TO BE BOTHERED
WITH RETHINKING OF ASSUMPTIONS,
AND MOST OF WHAT A DISSENTER MIGHT OFFER--
NAMELY, THAT CHINESE COMMUNISM WAS NO MORTAL THREAT TO US
AND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SOVIET FORM OF COMMUNISM
AND THAT HANOI POSED NO MAJOR THREAT TO US
AND WAS DIFFERENT ITSELF FROM MOSCOW AND PEKING--
THIS KIND OF CHALLENGE TO THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING A POLICY
WAS REGARDED AS TROUBLEMAKING.
McCullough:
OF ALL HIS ADVISORS, ONLY ONE WAS READY
TO BE A TROUBLEMAKER,
TO CHALLENGE THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
THAT JOHNSON HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SEND IN TROOPS--
UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE BALL.
Ball:
I THOUGHT THAT THE BALLOON WAS GOING UP MUCH TOO FAST,
SO I SPENT A FEW NIGHTS PREPARING A MEMORANDUM,
WHICH WAS 75 PAGES OR SO, WHICH IS NOW IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN,
IN WHICH I CHALLENGED EVERY ASSUMPTION OF OUR WAR IN VIETNAM
AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WASN'T A WAR WE COULD WIN.
THE NEXT MORNING, I GOT A CALL SAYING,
"DAMN YOU, GEORGE, YOU KEPT ME AWAKE ALL NIGHT.
"I READ THAT THING THREE TIMES.
"WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER GIVE IT TO ME BEFORE?
"GET OVER HERE IN THE MORNING
AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT IF IT TAKES ALL DAY."
Berman:
GEORGE BALL IS TELLING JOHNSON,
"LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE IN VIETNAM.
"YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A PROTRACTED WAR
"THAT WILL DIVIDE AMERICA.
"AT THE END OF THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS,
"YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN VIETNAM WITH 500,000 AMERICAN TROOPS
"AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH
YOUR POLITICAL OBJECTIVE."
HE'S ADVISING JOHNSON TO LET THE GOVERNMENT FALL,
LET THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH VIETNAM FALL AND WALK AWAY.
AND IT MUST BE SHOCKING TO HIM-- "WHAT IF GEORGE BALL IS RIGHT?"
NOW, FROM HIS MILITARY ADVISORS HE HEARS THE SAME THING--
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG, PROTRACTED WAR
IN THE JUNGLES OF VIETNAM;
FOUR, FIVE YEARS, 500,000 TROOPS, 600,000 TROOPS.
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE
ON THIS MAN AT THIS ONE PERIOD.
"WHAT DO I DO?
IS GEORGE BALL RIGHT?
ARE THE MILITARY COMMANDERS RIGHT?"
IS THIS GOING TO BE A QUAGMIRE?
McCullough:
JOHNSON STILL CLUNG TO THE IDEA
THAT THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARMY COULD WIN THE WAR THEMSELVES.
HE TOLD HIS ADVISORS,
"GET EVERY SOUTH VIETNAMESE MAN UNDER 40 YEARS
"AND GET IT DONE-- FIGHT 'EM, KILL 'EM.
"GET OFF THAT GOLD WATCH, PHI BETA KAPPA KEY.
LET'S GET GOING."
( machine gun fire )
AT THE END OF MARCH, HO CHI MINH VOWED
THAT HE WAS READY TO FIGHT ANOTHER 20 YEARS
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK TO WIN.
JOHNSON GREW MORE AND MORE GRIM.
"EVERYTHING I KNEW ABOUT HISTORY," HE SAID,
"TOLD ME THAT IF I GOT OUT OF VIETNAM
"AND LET HO CHI MINH RUN THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAIGON,
"THEN I'D BE DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID IN WORLD WAR II.
I'D BE GIVING A BIG, FAT REWARD TO AGGRESSION."
THE WAR WAS CAREENING OUT OF CONTROL.
( explosion )
SOUTH VIETNAM WAS ABOUT TO FALL.
JOHNSON COULD HESITATE NO LONGER.
HE WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE-- ESCALATE OR WITHDRAW.
AT THE END OF JULY, HE INVITED HIS ADVISORS
TO A REMARKABLE SERIES OF MEETINGS THAT LASTED ALL WEEK.
THE ISSUES WOULD BE AIRED ONE LAST TIME.
"I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY SNAP JUDGMENTS," JOHNSON TOLD THEM.
"I WANT TO CONSIDER ALL OUR OPTIONS."
ONCE AGAIN, BALL ARGUED HIS CASE--
"WE CANNOT WIN;
THIS WAR WILL BE LONG AND PROTRACTED."
AND ONCE AGAIN, BALL WAS SHOT DOWN.
"IF THE COMMUNIST WORLD FINDS OUT
"WE WILL NOT PURSUE OUR COMMITMENT TO THE END,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WILL STAY THEIR HAND."
HOW WE REACTED IN VIETNAM
WOULD BE LOOKED UPON BY OTHER GOVERNMENTS
AS A SIGN AS TO HOW WE WOULD REACT UNDER OTHER TREATIES
SUCH AS NATO AND THE RIO PACT.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE REPUTATION OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR FIDELITY TO ITS SECURITY TREATIES
IS NOT JUST A SIMPLE QUESTION OF FACE AND PRESTIGE--
IT'S A REAL PILLAR OF PEACE IN THE WORLD.
McCullough:
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McNAMARA AGREED WITH RUSK.
HE ASSURED THE PRESIDENT THAT WE COULD WIN
WITHIN TWO AND A HALF YEARS.
THERE WAS NO RISK OF A CATASTROPHE.
BUT BALL CONTINUED TO ARGUE--
"TAKE WHAT PRECAUTIONS WE CAN, MR. PRESIDENT.
"TAKE OUR LOSSES, NEGOTIATE, DISCUSS,
"KNOWING FULL WELL THERE WILL BE
A PROBABLE TAKEOVER BY THE COMMUNISTS."
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY DIFFICULT
TO DO WHAT GEORGE BALL URGED, WHICH WAS STRAIGHT WITHDRAWAL.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN, I THINK, VERY DAMAGING TO THE COUNTRY.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIVISIVE.
Thomson:
WITHDRAWAL IS NOT
WHAT A BIG, COMMANDING TEXAN EVER DOES.
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE WAS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT DEAL MAKERS.
HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT OVERSEAS,
ESPECIALLY WHEN COMMUNISM WAS INVOLVED
AND WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE APPEARED TO BE AT STAKE.
I HAVE A GREAT SYMPATHY WITH THE MAN
FOR WHAT HE WENT THROUGH WITH REFERENCE TO THE WAR.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANY OTHER PRESIDENT
WOULD HAVE DONE IT ANY DIFFERENTLY.
IF YOU ANALYZE IT WITH GREAT CARE AS HE DID
AND YOU LINE UP ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF GOING ON WITH IT
AND THOSE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO IT,
IT'S TEN, 15, 20 TO ONE.
McCullough:
AFTER MONTHS OF DOUBT,
THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS DECISION.
HE HAD INHERITED A LIMITED WAR.
NOW HE CHOSE TO EXPAND IT.
ON JULY 28, 1965, HE ADDRESSED REPORTERS
AT AN AFTERNOON PRESS CONFERENCE.
I HAVE TODAY ORDERED TO VIETNAM THE AIR MOBILE DIVISION
AND CERTAIN OTHER FORCES WHICH WILL RAISE OUR FIGHTING STRENGTH
FROM 75,000 TO 125,000 MEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
ADDITIONAL FORCES WILL BE NEEDED LATER
AND THEY WILL BE SENT AS REQUESTED.
Berman:
THIS WAS IT, THE WAR WAS AMERICANIZED--
WE WERE COMMITTED.
WE WERE COMMITTED TO NOT LOSING VIETNAM.
Ellsberg:
MOST PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS IMAGINED, AND BECAUSE,
IN PART, THEY'VE BEEN TOLD, THAT A PRESIDENT LIKE JOHNSON
COULD ONLY HAVE GOTTEN US INTO THIS
IF HE HAD BEEN UNAWARE, IF HE HAD BEEN DECEIVED, LIED TO.
NOW, THAT WAS UNTRUE;
HE HAD BEEN TOLD HE WAS HEADING INTO A CATASTROPHE,
BUT I THINK HE FOUND IT IN HIMSELF
THAT HE MIGHT GET AWAY WITH IT.
AND THAT POSSIBILITY, I THINK, DREW HIM ON
INTO THIS SEA OF DEVASTATION.
McCullough:
THE PRESIDENT NEVER ASKED FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR,
BUT ON JULY 28, 1965, LYNDON JOHNSON WENT TO WAR IN VIETNAM.
HE KEPT THE RISKS AND COSTS OF WAR HIDDEN
FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
HE NEVER TOLD THEM
HE'D BEEN WARNED THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS
MIGHT BE NEEDED,
NEVER PREPARED THEM FOR THE STRUGGLE
HE KNEW MIGHT LIE AHEAD.
Reporter:
DOES THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SENDING ADDITIONAL FORCES
IMPLY ANY CHANGE IN THE EXISTING POLICY
OF RELYING MAINLY ON THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE
TO CARRY OUT OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS?
IT DOES NOT IMPLY ANY CHANGE IN POLICY WHATEVER.
IT DOES NOT IMPLY ANY CHANGE OF OBJECTIVE, UH...
Berman:
HE DOESN'T TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
BECAUSE HE FEARS THAT IF HE MOVES AHEAD
AND ESCALATES THE WAR IN VIETNAM AND MOBILIZES
AND DOES ALL OF THESE ACTIONS,
THAT'S THE END OF THE GREAT SOCIETY;
THAT'S THE END OF THE ONE THING HE CARES ABOUT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.
Johnson:
THIS NATION IS MIGHTY ENOUGH,
ITS SOCIETY IS HEALTHY ENOUGH,
ITS PEOPLE ARE STRONG ENOUGH
TO PURSUE OUR GOALS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
WHILE STILL BUILDING A GREAT SOCIETY HERE AT HOME.
( applause )
McCullough:
JUST TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DECISION
TO COMMIT AMERICA TO A LAND WAR IN ASIA,
HE TRAVELED TO INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI,
AND SIGNED INTO LAW MEDICARE.
Newsreel announcer:
MR. JOHNSON CHOSE TO SIGN THE BILL HERE
AS A TRIBUTE TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMAN.
THE FORMER PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED FOR MEDICARE 20 YEARS AGO,
BUT IT TOOK TWO DECADES FOR HIS PROPOSAL TO BECOME LAW.
THE NEW BILL EXPANDS
THE 30-YEAR-OLD SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM
TO PROVIDE HOSPITAL CARE,
NURSING HOME CARE, HOME NURSING SERVICE
AND OUTPATIENT TREATMENT FOR THOSE OVER 65.
McCullough:
JOHNSON CONTINUED TO PASS LEGISLATION.
ONLY THE PRESIDENT KNEW
THAT HIS GREAT SOCIETY WAS IN JEOPARDY.
HE HID THE COSTS OF THE WAR FROM CONGRESS AND SIGNED MORE BILLS.
Kearns Goodwin:
WHEN HE GOT INTO THAT GREAT SOCIETY MODE,
HE LOOKED AT EVERY PROBLEM IN THE SOCIETY
AND FELT, "I'M GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER."
HE HAD THIS DESIRE TO PERFECT EVERYTHING,
AND TO HAVE HIS STAMP ON EVERYTHING.
SO HE SAW HANDICAPPED PEOPLE,
HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR THEM;
RETARDED PEOPLE, HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR THEM.
WHATEVER IT WAS, HE WANTED TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.
HE LIKED TO MAKE EVERYBODY FEEL GOOD.
Shriver:
YOU COULD SEE THE GREAT PROGRESS
WHICH WAS BEING MADE FOR POOR PEOPLE.
YOU COULD SEE THE TRANSFORMATION OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN
WHO WERE IN THE UPWARD BOUND PROGRAM.
YOU COULD SEE THEM GOING TO UNIVERSITIES
WHEN THEY NEVER HAD ANYBODY IN THEIR FAMILY
EVER WENT TO COLLEGE IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE.
YOU COULD SEE THAT.
YOU COULD SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE MOTHERS--
NOT JUST TO THE CHILDREN, BUT THE MOTHERS OF THE CHILDREN--
IN THE HEADSTART PROGRAM.
YOU COULD SEE MOTHERS WHO WERE ILLITERATE
AND NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL
SUDDENLY STARTING TO LEARN THEMSELVES
BECAUSE THEY WERE LEARNING SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH THEIR CHILD WHO WAS IN HEADSTART.
YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE 16 TO 21 WHO WERE IN THE JOB CORPS
ACTUALLY GRADUATING AND GOING OUT AND GETTING JOBS
AND BEGINNING TO LEAD USEFUL LIVES.
PEOPLE WERE COMING OUT OF POVERTY AND WE COULD SEE IT.
IT'S LIKE LARGESS, IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE,
SOMETHING COMES FROM THE SKY.
THERE'S A BUNCH OF BILLS THAT SAY, "WE UNDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM
"AND WE'RE GOING TO SEND YOU A TON OF MONEY
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT AND AMERICAN WAY."
I WANT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY TO BE SPREAD ACROSS THIS LAND--
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST AND WEST, TO ALL PEOPLE
WHATEVER THEIR RACE, WHATEVER THEIR WORK, WHEREVER THEY LIVE.
Malafronte:
TELEVISION WASN'T FAIR TO JOHNSON.
HE LOOKED FUNNY, WITH THOSE BIG EARS
AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF.
BUT IN PERSON HE WAS REALLY A HANDSOME GUY--
BIG, TALL, HANDSOME MAN.
AND HE CAME...
PUTS HIS ARM...
I WAS JUST A CITY AIDE, HAPPY TO BE LOOKING ON.
THEN HE PUTS HIS ARM AROUND YOU AND SAYS,
"YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB, SON."
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY HEADY STUFF.
YOU JUST LOVED THE GUY.
Johnson:
THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TIMID SOULS
AND TREMBLING SPIRITS.
Malafronte:
HE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE PROGRAMS.
HE'D SAY, "PEOPLE-- I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE.
I MEAN P-E-E-P-U-L...
I'M TALKING FOLKS!"
Doggett:
YEAH, IT WAS AN EXCITING TIME.
WE WERE BEING CHALLENGED
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TO GO INTO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND MAKE A CHANGE.
AND NOT ONLY WAS IT RHETORIC,
THERE WERE DOLLARS COMING IN
TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
LYNDON JOHNSON WAS SAYING THAT THIS HAS TO BE DONE
AND WE BELIEVED IT COULD BE DONE.
WASHINGTON SHOULD NOT BE TELLING YOUR HOMETOWN WHAT TO DO
TO SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS OF POVERTY.
YOU OUGHT TO BE TELLING US WHAT WE CAN DO
TO HELP YOU CARRY OUT YOUR PLANS.
IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO ENERGIZE AND EMPOWER POOR PEOPLE.
THAT'S RARELY IF EVER DONE BY AN ELECTED GOVERNMENT.
IT HAD A GALVANIZING EFFECT ON A LOT OF COMMUNITY PERSONS
WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS
AND AMERICAN LIFE IN A WAY
THAT THE POVERTY PROGRAM PERMITTED THEM TO DO,
AND THAT WAS GREAT.
Doggett:
CERTAINLY, THIS WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR MINORITIES,
FOR WOMEN WHO UP TILL THEN HAD REALLY NOT HAD A CHANCE
TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN RUNNING A LARGE ORGANIZATION.
SO I VERY EARLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BECOME AN ADMINISTRATOR OF A VERY LARGE CORPORATION,
A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR CORPORATION,
WHICH, OF COURSE, WAS REALLY UNIQUE IN THOSE DAYS.
WE WERE YOUNG, WE WERE GIFTED, WE WERE BLACK
AND WE SAW RESOURCES THERE, WE SAW NATIONAL WILL THERE
AND THEN THERE WAS CERTAINLY THIS LOCAL ENERGY OF PEOPLE
WHO WANTED TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THEIR LIVES,
AND IT CAME TOGETHER ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
Announcer:
IN THE SAME ROOM WHERE PRESIDENT LINCOLN SIGNED
THE FIRST EMANCIPATION ORDER IN 1861,
PRESIDENT JOHNSON SIGNED THE 1965 VOTER REGISTRATION ACT
AND PLEDGED TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS A NEW CHANCE
TO FIND A POLITICAL VOICE.
McCullough:
THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT
OF THE JOHNSON PRESIDENCY WAS THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965.
100 YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR,
WITH A STROKE OF HIS PEN,
LYNDON JOHNSON GUARANTEED BLACK AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
( police sirens wailing )
BUT THE SENSE OF TRIUMPH AND ACCOMPLISHMENT WAS SHORT-LIVED.
JUST FIVE DAYS AFTER JOHNSON SIGNED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT,
RIOTS ERUPTED IN WATTS, A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD IN LOS ANGELES.
FIVE DAYS OF RIOTING LEFT 34 PEOPLE DEAD.
JOHNSON WAS SHATTERED.
AS ONE AIDE DESCRIBED HIM, "HE JUST WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT.
"HE REFUSED TO LOOK AT THE CABLES FROM LOS ANGELES
"DESCRIBING THE SITUATION.
"HE REFUSED TO TAKE THE CALLS FROM THE GENERALS.
WE NEEDED DECISIONS FROM HIM, BUT HE SIMPLY WOULDN'T RESPOND."
HE REACTED VERY BADLY-- HOW WOULD YOU REACT?
YOU'RE SITTING THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE COUNTRY,
AND PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE ALL THIS POWER
AND THE COUNTRY STARTS BURNING UP.
( police sirens )
JOHNSON HAD A GOOD HEART, BUT HE WASN'T A CIVIL RIGHTS EXPERT.
HE KNEW TEXAS, BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW BIG-CITY GHETTOS.
HE WANTED BLACK PEOPLE TO BE GRATEFUL.
"I DID THIS," AND HE'D PULL OUT A BILL
AND HE WOULD TELL WHAT HE DID ON IT.
"AND I DID THIS," AND HE'D PULL OUT ANOTHER BILL.
"AND I DID THIS, AND I'M DOING THIS--
HOW CAN THEY DO THIS TO ME?"
AND PEOPLE WOULD TRY TO TELL HIM,
AND IT WAS HARD TO TELL HIM.
McPherson:
AMERICAN RACISM WAS STILL THERE.
THE LAWS HAD NOT SUDDENLY ELIMINATED
HOW PEOPLE REALLY FELT.
( man shouting )
Malafronte:
I THINK THE GAP BETWEEN THE EXPECTATIONS
OF THE EARLY JOHNSON YEARS
AND THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENT TO PERFORM
CREATED A POTENTIAL EXPLOSION IN EVERY CITY IN AMERICA.
PEOPLE WERE DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY
AND RESPONDED BY ATTACKING WHATEVER WAS HANDY.
McCullough:
"HOW IS IT POSSIBLE," JOHNSON ASKED,
"AFTER ALL WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED?
HOW COULD IT BE?"
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK YOU TO GRANT US HUMAN DIGNITY?
SHOULD WE BE PUT DOWN AND SHOT TO DEATH FOR THIS REQUEST?
IF SO, YOU CAN AIM YOUR GUNS.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE CARE ABOUT DYING
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DENY US THE RIGHT TO LIVE?
Farmer:
LYNDON JOHNSON COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAD CHANGED ITS CLASS CONTENT.
JOHNSON FELT PARTICULARLY UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THIS NEW GROUP OF POORER BLACKS
FROM THE INNER CITIES OF THE NORTH.
THEY WERE NOT LIKE THE POOR BLACKS AND MEXICAN AMERICANS
THAT HE HAD HAD CONTACT WITH DOWN IN TEXAS.
THESE WERE DIFFERENT-- THESE WERE RAUCOUS PEOPLE,
THEY WERE ANGRY PEOPLE, THEY WERE BELLIGERENT FOLK.
THEY DID NOT SEE LYNDON JOHNSON AS A FRIEND;
THEY SAW LYNDON JOHNSON AS A WHITE MAN.
( crowd shouting )
WE WANT BLACK POWER!
WE WANT BLACK POWER!
WE WANT BLACK POWER!
WE WANT BLACK POWER!
WE WANT BLACK POWER!
McCullough:
INTEGRATION WAS NO LONGER THE BATTLE CRY.
WE WANT BLACK POWER!
WE WANT BLACK POWER!
McCullough:
"TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE"
IS WHAT NEW BLACK VOICES WERE SAYING
ABOUT JOHNSON'S ACHIEVEMENTS.
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS JOHNSON KNEW IT WAS OVER.
HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT, BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS.
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE GENERATIONS OF...
OF HEAPING INFERIORITY INTO OUR SOULS NEEDED TO BE PURGED.
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THAT AWFUL STUFF INTO PEOPLE,
WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO EXPEL IT, IT'S NOT COMING OUT PRETTY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STAND UP AND PREACH PRETTY SERMONS;
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY SOME UGLY THINGS, WHICH PEOPLE DID.
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOUR TELEVISION SET
AND LISTEN TO L.B.J. TELL YOU THAT
"VIOLENCE NEVER ACCOMPLISHES ANYTHING, MY FELLOW AMERICANS."
( cheering and applause )
BUT YOU SEE THE REAL PROBLEM WITH VIOLENCE IS
THAT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN VIOLENT.
WE HAVE BEEN TOO NONVIOLENT, TOO NONVIOLENT.
( cheering )
McCullough:
THE OPTIMISM OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
HAD GONE UP IN FLAMES.
JUSTICE, FAIRNESS, THE WAR ON POVERTY
HAD BEEN TOO LONG DELAYED IN AMERICA'S GHETTOS.
NOT EVEN A POLITICIAN OF JOHNSON'S GENIUS
WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD THE COUNTRY TOGETHER.
IN TIMES OF STRESS AND TENSION IN HIS LIFE,
JOHNSON WAS OFTEN STRUCK DOWN BY ILLNESS.
IN 1965, HE ENTERED BETHESDA NAVY HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY.
WITH TEN DOCTORS
AND THREE SECRET SERVICE MEN IN ATTENDANCE,
JOHNSON HAD HIS GALLBLADDER AND A KIDNEY STONE REMOVED.
AFTER A TWO-HOUR OPERATION, JOHNSON WENT RIGHT BACK TO WORK.
HE WAS NEVER SHY ABOUT CONDUCTING THE NATION'S BUSINESS
FROM THE MOST UNLIKELY PLACES.
HE COULD BE EARTHY AND CRUDE, EVEN VULGAR.
AFTER HIS OPERATION,
HE COULDN'T RESIST SHOWING REPORTERS HIS FOOT-LONG SCAR.
ONE CARTOONIST TRANSFORMED THE SCAR INTO A MAP OF VIETNAM.
JOHNSON HAD GAMBLED HIS POLITICAL FUTURE
AND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN
THAT HE COULD WIN A QUICK VICTORY,
THAT WHEN HE SENT AMERICAN TROOPS IN FORCE,
HO WOULD TURN TAIL AND RUN.
BUT THE NORTH VIETNAMESE REFUSED TO QUIT.
HO RESISTED JOHNSON'S ESCALATION WITH AN ESCALATION OF HIS OWN,
MATCHING HIM SOLDIER FOR SOLDIER.
FOUR MONTHS AFTER JOHNSON'S AGONIZING DECISION
TO SEND THE TROOPS,
HE RECEIVED AN OMINOUS PRIVATE REPORT
FROM THE MAN WHO HAD ARGUED MOST FERVENTLY
FOR THE LAND WAR IN ASIA.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT McNAMARA
HAD BEGUN TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS.
Berman:
IN LATE 1965,
WE HAVE MINUTES OF MEETINGS
IN WHICH THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, ROBERT McNAMARA,
TELLS LYNDON JOHNSON THAT "WE'VE BEEN TOO OPTIMISTIC--
"THE WAR CAN'T BE WON
IN THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE'VE THOUGHT."
McCullough:
EVEN WITH 600,000 MEN, McNAMARA TOLD HIM,
THE ODDS WERE 50-50 THAT AFTER A YEAR OR MORE
THERE WOULD BE A MILITARY STANDOFF.
I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING
THAT JOHNSON DID NOT WANT TO HEAR
WHAT THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAD TO SAY,
AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON,
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO MEN DETERIORATED
AND WAS NEVER THE SAME.
Ball:
HE WANTED DESPERATELY TO BE TOLD
THAT THINGS WERE GOING WELL,
AND HE WASN'T NECESSARILY GETTING THAT ADVICE.
WELL, I THINK IT SHOOK HIM A GREAT DEAL.
I THINK THAT HE FELT THAT HE HAD GOTTEN...
HE WAS RIDING A TIGER AND HE COULDN'T GET OFF.
McCullough:
THE WHITE HOUSE COULD KEEP
THESE INTERNAL DEBATES HIDDEN,
BUT THERE WAS NO HIDING WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN VIETNAM.
THIS IS WHAT THE WAR IN VIETNAM IS ALL ABOUT.
( man speaking Vietnamese )
THE OLD AND THE VERY YOUNG.
THE MARINES HAVE BURNED THIS OLD COUPLE'S COTTAGE
BECAUSE FIRE WAS COMING FROM HERE.
Reporter:
We're on the outskirts of the village of Cam Ny with elements of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines.
McCullough:
JOHNSON BRIDLED AT WHAT HE SAW.
HE KNEW THE POWER OF TELEVISION
AND WORRIED ABOUT HOW AMERICANS WOULD REACT
TO WATCHING THE WAR IN THEIR LIVING ROOMS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.
Reporter:
Today's operation is the frustration of Vietnam in miniature.
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT AMERICAN FIREPOWER
CAN WIN A MILITARY VICTORY HERE.
BUT TO A VIETNAMESE PEASANT
WHOSE HOME MEANS A LIFETIME OF BACKBREAKING LABOR, it will take more than presidential promises to convince him that we are on his side.
McCullough:
AMERICANS BEGAN TO QUESTION
THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR.
AT FIRST, THEIR NUMBERS WERE SMALL
AND JOHNSON DISMISSED THEM.
BUT HE COULD NOT IGNORE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SENATE.
Man:
I STILL THINK THESE PRINCIPLES
UPON WHICH WE REST OUR POLICY
ARE SUBJECT TO VERY SERIOUS QUESTION.
ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS CLARIFICATION
OF WHAT OUR OBJECTIVE IS IN THIS STRUGGLE.
McCullough:
FEBRUARY 1966--
SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT BEGAN TO HOLD TELEVISED HEARINGS.
FULBRIGHT HAD GUIDED THE TONKIN GULF RESOLUTION
THROUGH AN OBEDIENT CONGRESS ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT.
NOW HE WAS LEADING SENATE LIBERALS IN AN ANTIWAR REVOLT
AGAINST THE WHITE HOUSE.
Church:
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE WAR IN VIETNAM
AS A COVERT INVASION OF THE SOUTH BY THE NORTH
OR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AS BASICALLY AN INDIGENOUS WAR.
BUT EITHER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT, IT'S A WAR BETWEEN VIETNAMESE
TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ULTIMATE KIND OF GOVERNMENT
IS GOING TO BE FOR VIETNAM.
NOW, WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL, THAT WAS A CIVIL WAR.
Announcer:
We'll be back with more of the stormy Senate hearings when ABC's Scope continues.
McCullough:
JOHNSON WAS FURIOUS.
HE BEGAN REFERRING TO FULBRIGHT AS "HALFBRIGHT"
AND CUT HIM OFF ENTIRELY.
THEIR 20-YEAR FRIENDSHIP WAS OVER.
HE PLACED FULBRIGHT AND SEVERAL OTHER SENATE LIBERALS
UNDER F.B.I. SURVEILLANCE.
JOHNSON RIDICULED HIS CRITICS.
HE CALLED THEM "CUT-AND-RUN PEOPLE WITH NO GUTS."
"THEY'D RATHER FIGHT ME THAN THE ENEMY."
HE WAS BEGINNING TO HUNKER DOWN, ISOLATING HIMSELF FROM DISSENT.
( folk guitar music )
Tom Paxton:
♫I GOT A LETTER FROM L.B.J.♫
♫IT SAID THIS IS YOUR LUCKY DAY♫
♫TIME TO PUT YOUR KHAKI TROUSERS ON♫
♫WE'VE GOT A JOB FOR YOU TO DO♫
♫DEAN RUSK HAS CAUGHT THE ASIAN FLU♫
♫AND WE ARE SENDING YOU TO VIETNAM♫
♫LYNDON JOHNSON TOLD THE NATION "HAVE NO FEAR OF ESCALATION♫
♫"I AM TRYING EVERYONE TO PLEASE♫
♫"THOUGH IT ISN'T REALLY WAR, WE'RE SENDING 50,000 MORE♫
♫TO HELP SAVE VIETNAM FROM VIETNAMESE..."♫
McCullough:
JOHNSON HAD TAKEN THE COUNTRY INTO WAR
AND KEPT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE DARK.
NOW, AS THE FIGHTING ESCALATED,
MANY BEGAN TO CHALLENGE THE MORALITY OF THE WAR.
I DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND
WHY I WAS OPPOSED TO THE WAR IN VIETNAM.
I JUST KNEW THAT IT WAS WRONG
FOR A GREAT, PROUD, ABUNDANT NATION
TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD,
GOING IN AND CRUSHING A PEASANT SOCIETY.
IN MY OPINION, IT WAS LIKE A DECISION TO RELEASE THE FURIES.
I THINK THE THING
THAT THE ANTIWAR MOVEMENT PROBABLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
IS THAT ONCE HE HAD MADE IT, HE WASN'T GOING TO DRAW BACK.
JOHNSON ACTIVELY ARGUED WITH ME THAT HE WAS TRAPPED,
THAT HE HAD TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING TO BRING PEACE.
"I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M A COWARD," HE WOULD SAY.
"I DON'T WANT TO BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO'S LOST A WAR."
WELL, WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF HE'S THE FIRST PRESIDENT
WHO'S LOST A WAR THAT SHOULDN'T BE FOUGHT ANYWAY?
Crowd (chanting):
END THE WAR IN VIETNAM,
BRING THE TROOPS HOME.
END THE WAR IN VIETNAM, BRING THE TROOPS HOME.
END THE WAR IN VIETNAM, BRING THE TROOPS HOME.
McCullough:
BY THE SUMMER OF 1966,
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WERE IN VIETNAM.
STILL, HIS GENERALS KEPT ASKING FOR MORE.
(explosion)
THOUSANDS WERE DEAD.
JOHNSON'S DREAM OF A GREAT SOCIETY WAS IN DANGER.
AND THE END WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT.
McCullough:
IT WAS CALLED THE GOLDEN CHALICE--
THE MARRIAGE OF THE PRESIDENT'S YOUNGER DAUGHTER,
LUCI BAINES JOHNSON.
ONE REPORTER SAID,
"NOBODY WAS INVITED EXCEPT THE IMMEDIATE COUNTRY."
IT WAS AUGUST 6, 1966.
THERE WAS WAR IN VIETNAM AND RIOTS IN THE STREETS.
BUT THERE WAS STILL MORE JOHNSON HOPED TO DO.
WHAT HE WANTED WAS TIME-
- TIME TO BUILD HIS "GREAT SOCIETY."
"WE CAN'T QUIT NOW," HE TOLD AN AIDE.
"THIS MAY BE THE LAST CHANCE WE HAVE."
BUT TIME WAS RUNNING OUT.
OVER FOUR LONG, HOT SUMMERS,
RIOTS HAD BECOME A BRUTAL FACT OF AMERICAN LIFE.
JOHNSON LOOKED HELPLESSLY ON
AS MORE THAN 150 CITIES WENT UP IN FLAMES.
DETROIT WAS THE WORST:
43 DEAD, 7,000 ARRESTED, 1,300 BUILDINGS DESTROYED.
JOHNSON DISPATCHED ARMY PARATROOPERS
AND PREPARED TO SEND HIS OWN TASK FORCE TO INVESTIGATE.
AS PART OF THE TASK FORCE, ROGER WILKINS WAS THERE
AS THE PRESIDENT ISSUED HIS FINAL INSTRUCTIONS.
WELL, HE STARTED IN A LOW KEY.
"I DON'T WANT ANY BULLETS IN THOSE GUNS.
(louder):
"YOU HEAR ME?
I DON'T WANT ANY BULLETS IN THOSE GUNS!
"YOU HEAR ME, GENTLEMEN?
I DON'T WANT BULLETS IN THOSE GUNS!
"I DON'T WANT IT KNOWN
THAT ANY ONE OF MY MEN SHOT A PREGNANT NIG..."
AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HIS FACE GOT RED.
"WELL, I DON'T...
NO BULLETS IN THE GUNS!"
BUT HE WAS CLEARLY EMBARRASSED,
AND EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM WAS EMBARRASSED,
SO THEN HE TOLD US TO GO HOME AND PACK
AND GET AN AIR FORCE PLANE TO GO TO DETROIT.
AND AS WE WERE LEAVING, HE CALLED ME AND HE SAID,
"COME IN HERE, ROGER,"
AND I WENT INTO HIS OFFICE WITH HIM.
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I KNEW HE WANTED TO SAY, "I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY 'NIGGER,'"
BUT HE MEANT TO SAY "NIGGER"
AND I KNEW HE WANTED TO SAY, "I APOLOGIZE."
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT
AND SO HE WALKED ME OVER TO THE FRENCH DOORS
THAT WENT OUT TO THE ROSE GARDEN, AND IT'S THE AREA
WHERE EISENHOWER HAD HAD HIS PUTTING GREEN.
AND HE LOOKED OUT AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE LOOKED DOWN.
AND THERE ARE POCK MARKS ON THE FLOOR
WHERE EISENHOWER'S GOLF SHOES HAD HIT THE FLOOR,
AND HE FINALLY LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID,
"LOOK WHAT THAT SON OF A BITCH DID TO MY FLOOR!"
AND THEN HE PATTED ME ON THE BACK AND SAID,
"HAVE A NICE TRIP," AND THAT WAS HIS WAY OF APOLOGIZING.
IT WAS VERY HUMAN, I THOUGHT.
(siren wailing)
Johnson:
WE WILL NOT TOLERATE LAWLESSNESS.
WE WILL NOT ENDURE VIOLENCE.
IT MATTERS NOT BY WHOM IT IS DONE
OR UNDER WHAT SLOGAN OR BANNER.
IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.
PILLAGE, LOOTING, MURDER AND ARSON
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CIVIL RIGHTS.
THEY ARE CRIMINAL CONDUCT.
Malafronte:
THE ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM EVAPORATED
IN THE RIOTING OF '66-67.
AND WITH THE PRESSURE ON JOHNSON
TO ESTABLISH ORDER IN THE STREETS,
THIS WAS NOT THE MAN IN FRONT OF CONGRESS
SAYING, "WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE";
IT WAS A MAN CONCERNED AND UPSET
AND MAYBE WORRIED ABOUT HIS POLITICAL FUTURE
AND ON THE PHONE TO THE GOVERNOR SAYING,
"DAMN IT, CRACK DOWN ON THOSE PEOPLE."
WHAT HAPPENED IS, WE WERE ALL OVERWHELMED BY THE TIMES.
SO WAS HE.
McCullough:
THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY HAD CHANGED.
MANY AMERICANS BEGAN TALKING ABOUT LAW AND ORDER.
JOHNSON WAS ACCUSED OF FORCING RACIAL EQUALITY
AND NEGLECTING THE NEEDS OF MIDDLE-CLASS WHITE AMERICANS.
HE WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
AND A GROWING BACKLASH OF FEAR AND RESENTMENT.
THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO GET OUT OF CONTROL
AND PRESIDENT JOHNSON WAS
NO LONGER IN CONTROL OF THE CONGRESS.
THE ECONOMY WAS CREATING PROBLEMS FOR HIM;
THE WAR IN VIETNAM WAS BEING LOST;
AND UNFORTUNATELY
I'M AFRAID THAT INSTEAD OF BLAMING ALL THOSE FORCES,
HE TENDED TO BLAME US.
AND...
THE IRONY OF IT WAS
THAT WE WERE PROBABLY THE BEST FRIENDS THAT HE HAD.
(bombs exploding)
McCullough:
ON JANUARY 5, 1967,
LADY BIRD JOHNSON WROTE IN HER DIARY,
"A MIASMA OF TROUBLE HANGS OVER EVERYTHING."
AMERICAN PLANES HAD ALREADY STRUCK
MOST OF THE IMPORTANT TARGETS IN NORTH VIETNAM
BY THE END OF 1967.
SEVERAL TIMES JOHNSON ORDERED A HALT IN THE BOMBING
AND WAITED FOR A RESPONSE FROM HO.
NONE CAME.
JOHNSON'S GENERALS THOUGHT HE WAS TOO CAUTIOUS--
STAYING THEIR HAND,
PREVENTING THEM FROM USING AMERICA'S ENORMOUS FIREPOWER
TO FORCE A VICTORY.
BUT JOHNSON WAS TORMENTED BY A PERSISTENT NIGHTMARE:
THE FEAR OF TRIGGERING WORLD WAR III.
"IN THE DARK AT NIGHT," HE SAID,
"I WOULD LAY AWAKE PICTURING MY BOYS FLYING AROUND NORTH VIETNAM
"ASKING MYSELF, 'WHAT IF ONE OF THOSE TARGETS YOU PICK TODAY
TRIGGERS OFF RUSSIA OR CHINA?
'"
JOHNSON SPENT MANY HOURS
PERSONALLY SELECTING WHERE THE BOMBS SHOULD FALL.
Bundy:
HE GOT MORE UPSET ABOUT THINGS
AND MORE WORRIED ABOUT CONSTANTLY FOLLOWING IT,
GETTING THE LATEST STATISTICS, UNRELIABLE AS WE KNEW THEY WERE.
Reedy:
I REMEMBER ONCE IN A MEETING
WHERE THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT WAS BRIEFING
AND THE FIGURES DIDN'T SEEM TO JIBE TO ME AT ALL.
IT SOUNDED TO ME AS THOUGH THEY'D KILLED
TEN TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AS HAD LIVED IN VIETNAM
OVER A PERIOD OF TWO CENTURIES.
AND I SLIPPED HIM A NOTE, TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS,
A PRACTICE THAT WE'D BEEN ENGAGING IN
EVER SINCE I'D WORKED FOR HIM.
BOY, I GOT THE DIRTIEST LOOK:
NO MORE OF THIS.
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I TRIED IT,
BECAUSE I REALIZED IT WAS HOPELESS.
AND SINCE OUR COMMITMENT OF MAJOR FORCES IN JULY '65,
THE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION LIVING UNDER COMMUNIST CONTROL
HAS BEEN REDUCED TO WELL UNDER 20%.
Katzenbach:
I AM NOT SURE
THAT HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.
HE HAD A CAPACITY FOR SELF-DECEPTION ABOUT FACTS
THAT WAS TEN TIMES THE CAPACITY OF ANYBODY ELSE I'VE EVER MET.
AND IN THE CONTESTED AREAS,
THE TIDE CONTINUES TO RUN WITH US.
EVERYTHING WOULD COME AROUND
INTO HIS WAY HE FELT COMFORTABLE LOOKING AT IT,
WHETHER THAT HAD ANY RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT WENT ON
OR NOT.
THE CAMPAIGNS OF THE LAST YEAR DROVE THE ENEMY
FROM MANY OF THEIR MAJOR INTERIOR BASES.
McCullough:
WHEN JOHNSON CONTINUED TO INSIST
THAT AMERICA WAS MAKING PROGRESS,
FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE BELIEVED HIM.
NO ONE DIRECTLY ACCUSED THE PRESIDENT OF LYING.
THEY CALLED IT "THE CREDIBILITY GAP."
HE WAS SO USED TO USING WORDS AS A MEANS OF PERSUASION,
TO GET SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING;
SO USED TO TALKING
TO SEVEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
TELLING THEM SEVEN DIFFERENT THINGS
SO THAT THEY WOULD ALL COME TOGETHER
TO DO WHAT HE WANTED, THAT LYING AND PERSUASION
WERE ALL PART OF THE SAME THING FOR HIM.
AND I DON'T THINK HE EVEN KNEW THE TRUTH.
I'M NOT SURE THERE WAS TRUTH FOR HIM.
TRUTH WAS THE ACTION, THE PRODUCT.
THE MEANS DIDN'T MATTER HOW YOU GOT THERE.
BUT WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT AND YOU MAKE STATEMENTS
AND THOSE STATEMENTS ARE THEN PICKED UP
AND THEY'RE PUT ON TELEVISION, YOU'RE NOT JUST TALKING
TO SEVEN DIFFERENT SOUTHERNERS AND NORTHERNERS
WHO WILL NEVER SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER.
SUDDENLY, YOU GET THIS CREDIBILITY GAP,
BECAUSE PEOPLE HOLD YOU TO YOUR STATEMENTS.
Crowd ( chanting ):
HEY, HEY, L.B.J.--
HOW MANY KIDS DID YOU KILL TODAY?
HEY, HEY, L.B.J...
McCullough:
VIETNAM HAD BECOME LYNDON JOHNSON'S WAR
AND THE DEMONSTRATIONS TURNED PERSONAL.
Man:
AS BURNS STUMBLED OUT OF THAT BUNKER,
DAZED, WITH BLOOD ON HIM,
HE DIDN'T MUMBLE, "THOSE BASTARD VIETCONG."
HE DIDN'T MUMBLE, "THOSE BASTARD COMMUNISTS."
HE DIDN'T MUMBLE, "THOSE SLOPE-EYED BASTARDS."
HE MUMBLED ONLY ONE THING OVER AND OVER:
"THAT BASTARD JOHNSON!
THAT BASTARD JOHNSON!"
(chanting):
HEY, HEY, L.B.J.--
HOW MANY KIDS DID YOU KILL TODAY?
HEY, HEY, L.B.J.-
- HOW MANY KIDS DID YOU KILL TODAY?
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
HE WAS TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY BAFFLED BY IT.
FOR ONE THING, THE WHITE HOUSE WAS LOADED
WITH VERY YOUNG PEOPLE.
HE WOULD ALWAYS SEE THEM CORRECTLY DRESSED,
PERFECTLY GROOMED, PROPER,
AND TO HIM, THIS MUST BE AMERICAN YOUTH
AND THEREFORE, HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THOSE PEOPLE WERE OUTSIDE THE GATES.
WERE THEY EXTRATERRESTRIAL?
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?
Crowd:
HEY, HEY, L.B.J.-
- HOW MANY KIDS DID YOU KILL TODAY?
I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASTOUNDED
IF HE HAD KNOWN WHEN THEY HAD THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON
THAT A BUNCH OF KIDS WERE SLEEPING IN MY HOUSE
ON THE FLOOR
AND A BUNCH OF KIDS WERE SLEEPING
IN BOB McNAMARA'S HOUSE ON THE FLOOR.
WE NEVER TOLD THE PRESIDENT
THAT OUR CHILDREN FELT AS THEY DID
ABOUT THE WAR IN VIETNAM,
AND HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT.
I THINK HE PROBABLY SUSPECTED LEFT-WING PLOTS--
THAT SORT OF THING.
Ball:
HE SAID, "GEORGE, DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION
"TO ALL THESE KIDS ON THE CAMPUS.
"THEY'LL STOMP AROUND AND MAKE A LOT OF NOISE.
"WHAT REALLY MATTERS--
"WHAT IS THE GREAT BLACK BEAST THAT WE HAVE TO FEAR--
IS THE RIGHT WING."
HE WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T END IT
AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE COULDN'T WIN IT.
AND I KEPT TRYING TO PLEAD WITH HIM TO END IT, TO WIN IT--
TO END IT BY WINNING IT.
AND I SAID, "IF YOU HAVE TO BLOW HANOI OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH,
BLOW IT OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH."
HE SAID, "I CAN'T DO THAT, I CAN'T DO THAT.
"THEY TELL ME WE'RE WINNING, WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS THING.
I CAN'T USE ULTIMATE POWER."
I SAID, "WHY CAN'T YOU?
"I DON'T CARE WHAT ADVICE YOU'RE GETTING FROM WHOM.
"IT'S TOO SLOW, THE WAR'S TOO SLOW.
"YOU'RE NOT WINNING THE WAR.
YOU'RE LOSING THE BATTLE AT HOME AND IT'S GOING TO DESTROY YOU."
Katzenbach:
THERE WERE NO GOOD CHOICES
THAT ANYBODY COULD DEVISE
AS TO HOW YOU WERE GOING TO GET OUT OF VIETNAM
AND STILL HAVE AN HONORABLE PEACE OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND.
THE CHOICES THAT YOU HAD
WERE ALL SKEWED TOWARDS, "DO I SEND IN MORE TROOPS?
"DO I KEEP THE SAME TROOPS IN THERE?
"DO I DO MORE BOMBING?
"DO I PUT ON MORE PRESSURE?
"IN WHAT KIND OF CHEAP WAY CAN I PUT IT ON?
"WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF CHINA COMING IN?
SHOULD I BOMB IN CAMBODIA?"
THEY WERE ALL HAWKISH CHOICES
BECAUSE THERE REALLY WASN'T ANYTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE
THAT YOU COULD DEVISE.
WE HAD MORE THAN HALF A MILLION MEN THERE.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THEM OUT?
Martin Luther King:
THE BOMBS IN VIETNAM EXPLODE AT HOME.
THEY DESTROY THE DREAM AND POSSIBILITY
FOR A DECENT AMERICA.
IT IS ESTIMATED
THAT WE SPEND $322,000
FOR EACH ENEMY WE KILL IN VIETNAM
WHILE WE SPEND IN THE SO-CALLED WAR ON POVERTY IN AMERICA
ONLY ABOUT $53 FOR EACH PERSON CLASSIFIED AS POOR.
Connally:
I ARGUED WITH HIM A GREAT DEAL.
I SAID, "YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WRONG.
"YOU'RE TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THAT THEY CAN HAVE GUNS AND BUTTER."
AND I SAID, "THAT'S WRONG.
"THIS WAR IS COSTING AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GUNS AND BUTTER."
Shriver:
THE WAR AGAINST POVERTY
WAS KILLED BY THE WAR IN VIETNAM.
FIRST OF ALL, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MONEY.
SECONDLY, IT STOPPED
BECAUSE OF PREOCCUPATION WITH THE SHOOTING WAR
AND THE KILLING FIELDS OF THAT WAR.
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION AND BOMBING AND ALL THAT
CAPTURES THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION
MUCH MORE THAN CREATING SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD.
BIRTH IS NEVER DRAMATIZED LIKE DEATH.
McCullough:
THE RAIDS OVER NORTH VIETNAM CONTINUED
UNTIL MORE TONS OF BOMBS WERE DROPPED ON VIETNAM
THAN HAD BEEN DROPPED DURING ALL OF WORLD WAR II.
STILL, HO RESISTED.
"HANOI AND OTHER CITIES
MAY BE DESTROYED," HO TOLD HIS COUNTRYMEN,
"BUT THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED."
Thomson:
THE VIETNAMESE, HAD WE BOMBED THEM TO THE STONE AGE,
WOULD HAVE GONE BACK INTO THE JUNGLE, WAITED US OUT.
THEY KNEW SOMETHING
THAT WE ALSO KNEW BUT DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE
AND THAT WAS THAT SOMEDAY WE WOULD GO HOME
AND THEY COULD COME BACK AND REBUILD WHAT WE HAD DESTROYED.
I THINK I MADE TWO MISTAKES IN JUDGMENT.
ONE WAS THAT I UNDERESTIMATED
THE TENACITY OF THE NORTH VIETNAMESE.
AND I THINK I OVERESTIMATED
THE PATIENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
McCullough:
BY THE END OF 1967,
A GRIM SENSE OF SIEGE WAS SETTLING OVER THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT DUG IN.
HE HAD SPENT A LIFETIME CLIMBING TO THE PINNACLE OF POWER.
HIS WHOLE POLITICAL LIFE NOW HUNG ON ONLY ONE ISSUE:
VIETNAM.
HE DECIDED TO CALL IN THE MEN WHOM HE RESPECTED MOST.
THEY BECAME KNOWN AS "THE WISE MEN."
THERE WERE ABOUT TEN OF THEM.
IF YOU PUT THE TOTAL SERVICE, THOSE MEN MUST HAVE HAD 250 TO 300 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE.
McCullough:
THESE WERE THE ARCHITECTS
OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY:
DEAN ACHESON...
JOHN McCLOY...
AVERELL HARRIMAN.
"CONTAIN COMMUNISM, DON'T LET IT SPREAD,"
HAD BEEN THEIR ADVICE TO EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE TRUMAN.
THE PICTURE THAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM
WAS THAT WE WERE MAKING SLOW, GRINDING PROGRESS
AND WE THOUGHT WE COULD SEE, AT SOME POINT, A BREAK
WITH THE OTHER SIDE STARTING TO REALLY WEAKEN AND GO DOWNHILL.
McCullough:
DEAN ACHESON SAID LATER,
"I TOLD HIM HE WAS WHOLLY RIGHT ON VIETNAM,
THAT HE HAD NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO PRESS ON."
THEY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY FOR HIM TO GO ON WITH HIS COURSE.
HE WAS GREATLY COMFORTED BY THAT.
Bundy:
THE ADVICE THEY GAVE WAS,
"THE COUNTRY DOESN'T SEE IT THE WAY YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT.
"YOU'VE GOT TO DEVELOP A WAY
TO MAKE YOUR ASSESSMENTS OF THE SITUATION MORE CREDIBLE."
THEY GAVE HIM PERFECTLY SILLY ADVICE.
THEY WERE SENSIBLE PEOPLE,
AND WHY THEY WERE SO SILLY, I DON'T KNOW.
THE MAIN ADVICE WAS,
"YOU OUGHT TO IMPROVE YOUR PUBLIC RELATIONS."
WELL, AFTER THE MEETING,
I SPOKE TO DEAN ACHESON AND JOHN COLES AND ARTHUR DEAN
AND I SAID, "YOU OLD BASTARDS.
"YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.
"YOU'RE LIKE A LOT OF VULTURES SITTING ON THE FENCE
AND SENDING THE YOUNG MEN OUT TO DIE,"
AND I WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM.
McCullough:
JOHNSON HAD EXPANDED THE WAR IN SECRET.
NOW HE SET OUT TO SELL IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Johnson:
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS.
WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE GETTING.
I THINK WE'RE MOVING MORE LIKE THIS
AND I THINK THEY'RE MOVING MORE LIKE THIS
INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT UP AND STRAIGHT DOWN.
McCullough:
HE CALLED HOME
THE COMMANDER OF U.S. FORCES IN VIETNAM,
GENERAL WILLIAM WESTMORELAND,
FOR A ROUND OF WELL-PUBLICIZED MEETINGS
AND PRESS CONFERENCES.
Westmoreland:
THE ENEMY IS BEING
PROGRESSIVELY WEAKENED.
THE VIETNAMESE ARMED FORCES
AND THE GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE IS BEING STRENGTHENED.
Man:
THE GLOWING REPORTS ALWAYS CAME BACK FROM THE PENTAGON:
"HEY, JUST A LITTLE MORE.
"WE'RE WINNING THIS WAR;
IT'S ALMOST OVER.
WE CAN SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL."
McCullough:
IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER,
WITH REPORTERS AND TELEVISION CAMERAS IN TOW,
THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFF ACROSS THE PACIFIC.
JOHNSON WAS INSPIRED BY THE PHOTO OPPORTUNITY,
BUT HE WAS ALSO MOVED BY AMERICA'S FIGHTING MEN.
"WE'RE NOT GOING TO YIELD," HE TOLD THEM,
"AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHIMMY."
Johnson:
THE ENEMY IS NOT BEATEN,
BUT HE KNOWS THAT HE HAS MET HIS MASTER IN THE FIELD.
HE IS TRYING TO BUY TIME,
HOPING THAT OUR NATION, THAT OUR NATION'S WILL,
DOES NOT MATCH HIS WILL.
McCullough:
AFTER JUST A FEW HOURS IN VIETNAM,
THE PRESIDENT WAS ON HIS WAY TO PAKISTAN AND THEN ROME.
IT WAS LIKE A CAMPAIGN TOUR OF OLD.
JOHNSON PAID A SURPRISE VISIT TO THE VATICAN,
WHERE HE ASSURED POPE PAUL VI OF HIS DESIRE FOR PEACE.
HIS HOLINESS PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT
WITH A 14th-CENTURY PAINTING.
THE PRESIDENT RECIPROCATED
WITH A FOOT-HIGH PLASTIC BUST OF HIMSELF.
THE 27,000-MILE, FOUR-DAY JOURNEY
HAD BUOYED JOHNSON'S HOPES.
HE WANTED DESPERATELY TO BELIEVE
THAT AMERICA HAD TURNED THE CORNER IN VIETNAM;
THAT THERE WAS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
AND THEN TET CAME.
TET, TO ME, WAS THE ROOF FALLING IN.
McCullough:
AMERICA WATCHED AS SOUTH VIETNAM EXPLODED.
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE VIETNAMESE HOLIDAY KNOWN AS TET,
THE NORTH VIETNAMESE AND VIETCONG
CAUGHT AMERICAN FORCES BY SURPRISE.
FIVE OF THE SIX LARGEST CITIES
AND NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE DISTRICT CAPITALS
CAME SUDDENLY UNDER ATTACK.
THE ILLUSION OF PROGRESS WAS SHATTERED.
Reporter:
WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART OF IT?
NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY ARE;
THAT'S THE WORST.
RIDE AROUND, THEY RUN INTO THE SEWERS, GUTTERS, ANYWHERE.
JUST HOPE YOU CAN STAY ALIVE FROM DAY TO DAY.
I JUST WANT TO GO BACK HOME, GO TO SCHOOL.
HAVE YOU LOST ANY FRIENDS?
QUITE A FEW;
WE LOST ONE THE OTHER DAY.
THIS WHOLE THING STINKS, REALLY.
(child crying)
McCullough:
THE TET OFFENSIVE WENT ON
FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS.
WHEN IT WAS OVER,
THE VIETCONG HAD LOST THOUSANDS OF EXPERIENCED SOLDIERS
AND FAILED TO PROVOKE A POPULAR UPRISING.
BUT BY NOW, JOHNSON HAD MISLED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SO OFTEN
THAT WHEN HE TOLD THE TRUTH, FEW BELIEVED HIM.
Johnson:
THE BIGGEST FACT IS
THAT THE STATED PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL UPRISING--
A MILITARY VICTORY OR A PSYCHOLOGICAL VICTORY--
HAVE FAILED.
Katzenbach:
THERE IS AN INSTANCE
WHERE THE CREDIBILITY GAP REALLY HURT,
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY WAS CONVINCED
THAT TET HAD BEEN A VERY SERIOUS DEFEAT
FOR NORTH VIETNAM AND FOR THE VIETCONG,
AND THERE WAS JUST NO WAY
YOU COULD PERSUADE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT THAT WAS THE FACT.
WELL, IT SEEMS NOW MORE CERTAIN THAN EVER
THAT THE BLOODY EXPERIENCE OF VIETNAM
IS TO END IN A STALEMATE.
THIS SUMMER'S ALMOST CERTAIN STANDOFF WILL EITHER END
IN REAL GIVE-AND-TAKE NEGOTIATIONS
OR TERRIBLE ESCALATION.
McCullough:
WALTER CRONKITE, THE VETERAN NEWSCASTER
WHO HAD BEEN CALLED "THE MOST TRUSTED MAN IN AMERICA,"
ONCE SUPPORTED THE WAR;
TET CHANGED HIS MIND.
AND FOR EVERY MEANS WE HAVE TO ESCALATE,
THE ENEMY CAN MATCH US,
AND THAT APPLIES TO INVASION OF THE NORTH,
THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
OR THE MERE COMMITMENT OF 100,000 OR 200,000
OR 300,000 MORE AMERICAN TROOPS TO THE BATTLE.
AND WITH EACH ESCALATION
THE WORLD COMES CLOSER TO THE BRINK OF COSMIC DISASTER.
McCullough:
JOHNSON FELT MORE AND MORE ALONE.
MANY OF THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM HAD RESIGNED--
HIS PRESS SECRETARY, HIS SPECIAL ASSISTANT,
HIS PERSONAL AIDES AND ADVISORS.
AND NOW THE AIDE HE HAD CALLED
"THE MOST COMPETENT MAN I EVER KNEW,
THE MOST OBJECTIVE MAN I EVER MET"--
ONE OF THE ORIGINAL ARCHITECTS OF THE WAR, ROBERT McNAMARA--
WAS LEAVING.
ON FEBRUARY 28, EXHAUSTED AND DISILLUSIONED,
JOHNSON'S SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SAID GOOD-BYE.
McNamara:
MR. PRESIDENT... (clearing throat)
(in broken voice):
I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO...
EXPRESS WHAT LIES IN MY HEART TODAY...
AND I THINK I'D BETTER RESPOND ON ANOTHER OCCASION.
( applause )
McCullough:
"THE PRESSURE GOT SO GREAT,
BOB COULDN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT," JOHNSON SAID LATER.
"I LOVED HIM AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LET HIM GO,
"BUT HE WAS JUST SHORT OF CRACKING.
"TWO MONTHS BEFORE HE LEFT, HE FELT HE WAS A MURDERER
"AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF.
I NEVER FELT LIKE A MURDERER;
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE."
( applause )
McCullough:
MARCH 1, 1968.
CLARK CLIFFORD REPLACED ROBERT McNAMARA
AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.
I, CLARK M. CLIFFORD...
McCullough:
HALF A MILLION AMERICANS
WERE ALREADY IN VIETNAM
AND WESTMORELAND WANTED 200,000 MORE.
CLIFFORD CONFRONTED THE PENTAGON.
Clifford:
I'D SAY, "ARE WE NEARING THE END
OF THE WAR IN VIETNAM?"
"WE DO NOT KNOW."
"DO WE HAVE ENOUGH MEN IN VIETNAM NOW?"
"WE DO NOT KNOW."
"IS THE BOMBING BEING EFFECTIVE?"
"WELL, IN A LIMITED WAY."
I GOT DOWN FINALLY WHEN I SAID,
"NOW, WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR VICTORY IN VIETNAM?"
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.
IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAREER OF ANY OF THEM
THAT WE'D EVER FOUGHT A WAR IN THE JUNGLES OF THAT KIND.
FIREPOWER DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
I REMEMBER HEARING A GENERAL;
HE SAID, "DAMN THEM--
THEY WOULDN'T COME OUT AND FIGHT."
Johnson:
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT--
I DON'T WANT A MAN IN HERE
TO GO BACK HOME THINKING OTHERWISE.
WE ARE GOING TO WIN.
Clifford:
HE WAS GOING THROUGH AN AGONIZING PERIOD.
WE MET DAILY.
I FELT IT WAS MY TASK TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO PERSUADE THE PRESIDENT TO CHANGE OUR POLICY IN VIETNAM.
I NEEDED TIME TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO REVERSE THE PROCESS
THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON SINCE 1965, YOU SEE.
IT'S LIKE THIS GREAT TRAIN;
YOU JUST CAN'T SUDDENLY PUT IT IN REVERSE.
YOU HAVE TO KIND OF BRING IT TO A STOP.
STARTING IN AT THESE MEETINGS AND BIT BY BIT BY BIT,
POINTING OUT THE DISAPPOINTMENTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
THAT HAD OCCURRED;
THE REPORTS THAT WE WERE PREVAILING
WHEN IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WEREN'T--
EACH TIME HACKING AWAY.
BY THAT TIME MAYBE WE'D LOST 20,000 MEN OUT THERE,
HAD SPENT TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OF OUR COUNTRY'S TREASURE.
IT'S ALMOST BEYOND HUMAN CAPACITY AT THAT TIME
TO SAY, "WE'VE BEEN WRONG."
Reedy:
SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND YOU GIVE SOME ORDERS
AND SOME MEN GET KILLED.
YOU AREN'T GOING TO SAY TO YOURSELF--
AND I MEAN TO YOURSELF, LATE AT NIGHT--
"THOSE MEN ARE DEAD BECAUSE I WAS A DAMNED SLOB."
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "THOSE MEN DIED IN A NOBLE CAUSE
AND WE'VE GOT TO SEE THEY DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN."
SO YOU SEND MORE MEN TO VINDICATE THEIR DEATH.
McCullough:
"EVERY NIGHT WHEN I FELL ASLEEP," JOHNSON SAID,
"I WOULD SEE MYSELF TIED TO THE GROUND
"IN THE MIDDLE OF A LONG, OPEN SPACE.
"IN THE DISTANCE I COULD HEAR
"THE VOICES OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
"THEY WERE ALL SHOUTING AT ME AND RUNNING TOWARD ME--
"'COWARD, TRAITOR, WEAKLING!
'
"THEY KEPT COMING CLOSER.
"THEY BEGAN THROWING STONES.
AT EXACTLY THAT MOMENT I WOULD WAKE UP."
Reedy:
AROUND MIDNIGHT, 1:00, 2:00,
THE CASUALTY REPORTS WOULD START COMING IN.
HE WOULD WAKE UP AUTOMATICALLY AND CALL THE SITUATION ROOM
OR SOMETIMES WANDER DOWN THERE,
WHERE HE COULD GET THE DIRECT FIGURES.
THE MAN BECAME HAUNTED BY IT.
Cater:
WE WERE WORKING-- IT WAS AROUND 9:30 AT NIGHT--
AND SUDDENLY THE PRESIDENT CAME INTO THE ROOM.
AND WE ALL STOOD UP.
AND HE SAID A VERY STRANGE THING;
HE SAID, "WHERE ARE YOU SITTING?"
WELL, HE HAD NEVER ASKED THAT QUESTION BEFORE.
HE WOULD SIT DOWN IN ANY CHAIR THAT HE WANTED TO
AND WE WOULD RESEAT OURSELVES
TO ACCOMMODATE WHERE HE WAS SITTING.
BUT WE FOUND A SEAT FOR HIM AND HE SAT DOWN
AND HE JUST LOOKED LIKE...
SUNK.
AND HE SAID, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
"IF I PUT IN MORE BOYS, THERE'LL BE MORE KILLING.
"IF I TAKE OUT BOYS, THERE'LL BE MORE KILLING.
ANYTHING I DO, THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE KILLING."
AND HE JUST SAT THERE, AND THEN HE GOT UP AND LEFT.
Crowd (chanting):
HEY, HEY, L.B.J.--
HOW MANY KIDS HAVE YOU KILLED TODAY?
Valenti:
THE PRESIDENCY BECAME
A BURDEN THAT EACH DAY BECAME MORE DIFFICULT TO BEAR.
THE FURROWS IN THE FACE WERE DEEPER.
THE EYES...
WERE SADDER.
AND IT WAS ALMOST VISIBLY APPARENT
THAT THIS WAR WAS BREAKING THIS EXTRAORDINARY, FORMIDABLE MAN
WHO HAD NEVER BEEN BROKEN BEFORE.
Dugger:
WITH THE TURNING OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST HIM,
HIS ENTRAPMENT IN THE WAR, HIS INABILITY TO WIN IT
WITHOUT SIMPLY WIPING VIETNAM OFF THE MAP,
I THOUGHT JOHNSON HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE.
(chanting):
HELL NO, WE WON'T GO!
HELL NO, WE WON'T GO!
HELL NO, WE WON'T GO!
HELL NO, WE WON'T GO!
HELL NO, WE WON'T GO!
HELL NO, WE WON'T GO!
HELL NO, WE WON'T GO!
Rusk:
IN 1968 IT BECAME APPARENT TO US
THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE GRASS ROOTS
HAD FINALLY DECIDED THAT IF WE COULD NOT TELL THEM
WHEN THE WAR WAS GOING TO BE OVER, WE MIGHT AS WELL CHUCK IT.
( crowd yelling )
McCullough:
IN THE MIDST OF HIS DESPAIR OVER VIETNAM,
JOHNSON WAS FORCED TO COPE WITH THE 1968 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY MY CANDIDACY
FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
I DO NOT RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY MERELY TO OPPOSE ANY MAN
BUT TO PROPOSE NEW POLICY.
Wilkins:
THE THING THAT THE PRESIDENT REALLY HATED
WAS THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD BE THE MISTAKE
BETWEEN THE KENNEDYS,
THAT HE WOULD BE VIEWED AS THE MISTAKE BETWEEN THE KENNEDYS.
AND HE TRULY HATED BOB KENNEDY.
I MEAN, HE REALLY HATED HIM.
McCullough:
"THE THING I FEARED FROM THE FIRST DAY OF MY PRESIDENCY
"WAS ACTUALLY COMING TRUE.
"ROBERT KENNEDY HAD OPENLY ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION
TO RECLAIM THE THRONE IN THE MEMORY OF HIS BROTHER."
Janeway:
ALWAYS PARANOID.
ALWAYS INSECURE.
HIS INSECURITY HAD GROWN INTO A DISEASE, AND THE...
THE INSECURITY WAS ASSERTING ITSELF
IN PROCLAMATIONS AND ASSERTIONS.
WE SEEK NOT VICTORY OF CONQUEST,
BUT WE DO SEEK THE TRIUMPH OF JUSTICE.
THE RIGHT...
McCullough:
IN SPITE OF GROWING OPPOSITION TO HIS WAR POLICIES,
WARNINGS FROM HIS POLITICAL ADVISORS,
WITH OVER 20,000 AMERICANS DEAD, JOHNSON REMAINED ADAMANT.
WE SEEK THAT RIGHT, AND WE WILL, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, WIN.
( applause )
McCullough:
BY THE MIDDLE OF MARCH
CLARK CLIFFORD DESPAIRED OF EVER CHANGING THE PRESIDENT'S MIND.
ONLY ONE GROUP OF AMERICANS MIGHT BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE HIM:
THOSE FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS CALLED "THE WISE MEN."
FIVE MONTHS BEFORE,
THE WISE MEN HAD CHEERED JOHNSON WITH THEIR SUPPORT.
NOW CLIFFORD ENCOURAGED THE PRESIDENT
TO MEET WITH THEM ONE MORE TIME.
ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT SOUND SOMEWHAT CONSPIRATORIAL,
I THOUGHT IT WISE TO CONTACT A GOOD MANY OF THEM FIRST.
SO I DID.
I KNEW THEM ALL, KNOWN THEM ALL FOR YEARS.
AND I GOT A FEELING FROM THEM.
I MADE FOUR, FIVE OR SIX CONTACTS
AND FOUND THAT IN EACH INSTANCE, TET HAD CHANGED THEIR MIND.
THEY ALL CAME BACK;
WE WENT THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS READING CABLES, GETTING BRIEFED.
AND WE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT.
THEY'D ALL TURNED AROUND.
THE IMPACT WAS PROFOUND,
SO PROFOUND THAT HE THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG.
AND HE USED THE EXPRESSION,
"I THINK SOMEBODY HAS POISONED THE WELL."
Goodwin:
HE HAD PICKED THESE OLD COLD WARRIORS
WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING THE BATTLE OF CONTAINMENT
AND HE LISTENED TO THEIR ADVICE.
AND AS LONG AS THEY STAYED WITH HIM,
HE FELT THAT HE MUST BE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
AND THEN, FINALLY, AT THE END, THEY LEFT HIM.
THEY ALL SAID, "IT'S NOT WORKING,"
AND THEY WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
AND THERE WAS LYNDON JOHNSON, ALL ALONE WITH HIS WAR,
THE LAST BELIEVER.
McCullough:
MARCH 31, 1968.
FIVE DAYS AFTER MEETING WITH THE WISE MEN,
JOHNSON APPEARED UNUSUALLY CALM
AS HE REHEARSED HIS SPEECH ON VIETNAM.
...TO DISCUSS THE MEANS OF BRINGING THIS WAR TO AN END.
NOW, LET'S HAVE WALT OUTLINE THE THREE OR FOUR STEPS
WE WANT TO ASK THESE FOLKS TO DO...
Clifford:
A WEEK BEFORE HE WAS TO DELIVER THAT SPEECH,
HE CALLED AND SAID HE WANTED ME TO SIT IN FROM THEN ON
WITH THOSE WHO WERE PREPARING THE SPEECH.
BUT WHEN I GOT THERE, THE FIRST LINE OF THE SPEECH WAS,
"MY FRIENDS, I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU TONIGHT
ABOUT THE WAR IN VIETNAM."
GOSH, THIS IS HARD TO READ, JIM, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
IT'S JUST MARKED UP EVERY WORD NEARLY, YOU SEE?
Clifford:
ON THE EVENING OF SUNDAY, MARCH 31,
THE FIRST LINE WAS, "MY FRIENDS, I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU TONIGHT
ABOUT PEACE IN VIETNAM."
GOOD EVENING, MY FELLOW AMERICANS.
TONIGHT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU
OF PEACE IN VIETNAM AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.
McCullough:
AT FIRST THE SPEECH SEEMED LIKE MANY OTHERS--
ONE MORE PAUSE IN THE BOMBING,
ONE MORE GESTURE TOWARD NEGOTIATION.
TONIGHT I HAVE ORDERED OUR AIRCRAFT AND OUR NAVAL VESSELS
TO MAKE NO ATTACKS ON NORTH VIETNAM
EXCEPT IN THE AREA NORTH OF THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE...
McPherson:
THE DAY BEFORE HE MADE THE SPEECH,
WE HAD AN ALL-DAY MEETING, AND HE SAID,
"HAVE YOU SEEN THE LAST PART OF THE SPEECH?"
AND I SAID, "NO, BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S IN IT."
AND HE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?"
I SAID, "I'M VERY SORRY."
AND HE SAID...
HE SAID, "WELL, OKAY, SO LONG, PARTNER."
HE HAD SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT HE MIGHT NOT RUN AGAIN.
AND I HAD ALWAYS INTERPRETED THIS AS MEANING THAT HE WOULD.
WITH OUR HOPES AND THE WORLD'S HOPES FOR PEACE
IN THE BALANCE EVERY DAY, I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT I SHOULD DEVOTE AN HOUR OR A DAY OF MY TIME
TO ANY PERSONAL, PARTISAN CAUSE.
I REMEMBER BEING TORN, LITERALLY 50-50,
HALF OF ME HOPING HE WOULD DO IT--
THAT IS, ANNOUNCE HIS WITHDRAWAL--
AND HALF OF ME HOPING HE WOULDN'T DO IT.
AND WHEN HE GOT TO WHAT I KNEW WAS THE END,
I GOT UP AND SAID, "WELL, LET'S TURN IT OFF AND TALK ABOUT IT."
AND I MOVED TOWARD THE SET AND THEN CAME THE SAYONARA.
I SHALL NOT SEEK AND I WILL NOT ACCEPT
THE NOMINATION OF MY PARTY FOR ANOTHER TERM AS YOUR PRESIDENT.
Connally:
I WAS SURPRISED.
I WAS SURPRISED.
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK HE'D EVER REALLY DO IT.
HERE WAS A MAN WHOSE WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN POLITICS-
- EVERYTHING--
TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE, REALLY.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
IT WAS LIKE A...
IT WAS LIKE A...
A PERCUSSION GRENADE GOING OFF IN THAT ROOM.
I WAS STUNNED.
I...
WAS OVERWHELMED WITH EXHILARATION.
IT WAS AS IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME I'D WON THE NOBEL PRIZE.
THERE WAS HOPE SUDDENLY.
IT JUST BROKE ME IN TWO
BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT TO HIM TO SAY IT
AND I COULDN'T STAND IT.
AND THREE MEN AND I WERE IN A CAR
AND WE ALL BEGAN TO JUST OPENLY CRY
BECAUSE IT WAS TEARING OUR HEART APART
AND OF COURSE WE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT TO HIM.
McCullough:
SURROUNDED BY HIS FAMILY, LYNDON JOHNSON WITHDREW
AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THREE DAYS LATER, HO CHI MINH RESPONDED:
NORTH VIETNAM WAS READY TO TALK.
BUT THE WAR WOULD GO ON FOR ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS.
JOHNSON WOULD REMAIN IN OFFICE TEN MORE MONTHS,
A LAME DUCK PRESIDENT, HELPLESSLY WATCHING
AS THE COUNTRY DRIFTED CLOSER TO ANARCHY
THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.
ON APRIL 4 HE LEARNED THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,
WAS SHOT AND KILLED.
TWO MONTHS LATER, ROBERT KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED.
IN AUGUST, POLICE BATTLED ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATORS
AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION IN CHICAGO.
AND THEN, IN NOVEMBER, RICHARD NIXON,
THE REPUBLICAN WHO SAID HE REPRESENTED
"THE FORGOTTEN AMERICANS, THE NON-SHOUTERS,"
WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT.
"I SOMETIMES FELT," JOHNSON SAID,
"THAT I WAS LIVING IN A CONTINUOUS NIGHTMARE."
Pickle:
YOU KNEW IT WAS THE END OF THE ROAD FOR THAT PRESIDENCY.
AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT YOU HAD ENJOYED--
THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU HAD HAD
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING
AND MAYBE YOU HAD DONE SOMETHING FOR YOUR COUNTRY--
FOR THOSE OF US WHO WERE PART OF THE JOHNSON TEAM,
THAT BROKE OUR HEARTS.
Wilkins:
MY FEELINGS WERE SO MIXED ABOUT THE MAN.
THERE WAS PART OF ME THAT NEVER STOPPED LOVING HIM
AND THERE WAS A PART OF ME THAT HATED HIM.
SO I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND.
AND IT WAS MAINLY SADNESS, I GUESS.
Janeway:
ONLY HE, WITH ALL OF HIS REMARKABLE GIFTS AND KNOWLEDGE,
COULD HAVE HAD A REALISTIC APPRECIATION
OF THE EXTENT OF HIS OPPORTUNITY
AND OF THE EXTENT OF BOTH HIS ACHIEVEMENT AND HIS FAILURE.
Dallek:
THE LIBERAL IMPULSE THAT WENT BACK TO THE NEW DEAL
IS CHALLENGED, AND WHAT YOU GET BEGINNING IN '68, I BELIEVE,
WITH RICHARD NIXON'S ELECTION, IS AN ERA OF CONSERVATISM.
AND THE IRONY IS, JOHNSON PRESIDES
OVER THE EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT OF LIBERALISM
REACHING ITS ZENITH, REACHING ITS HEIGHTS,
AND THEN WITHIN THREE YEARS' TIME, PLUNGES TO ITS DEPTHS,
FROM WHICH IT STILL HASN'T RECOVERED IN THE YEAR 1990.
Malafronte:
WHAT HE WANTED WAS PEOPLE TO LOVE HIM
AND WHAT HE WANTED TO DO
WAS TO SOLVE EVERYBODY'S PROBLEMS HIMSELF.
FOR JOHNSON, HE HAD NO OTHER VOCABULARY,
NO OTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE
OTHER THAN TO HAVE INVOLVEMENT OF GOVERNMENT IN A BIG WAY.
GIVE THEM A LOT OF MONEY,
PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND THEM AND LOVE THEM.
HE WAS THE LAST SOLDIER IN THE NEW DEAL WAR.
McCullough:
CONGRESSMAN, SENATOR, VICE-PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT--
WASHINGTON HAD BEEN HIS LIFE FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
NOW HE WAS GOING HOME TO THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY,
WHERE, AS HIS FATHER TOLD HIM,
"THE PEOPLE KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SICK AND CARE WHEN YOU DIE."
Connally:
THE BASIC, SEDENTARY LIFE THAT HE WAS RELEGATED TO
WAS NOT THE TYPE OF LIFE THAT HE ENJOYED OR HAD EVER KNOWN.
HIS LIFE HAD BEEN ENORMOUSLY ACTIVE,
HAD BEEN CENTERED AROUND POLITICS.
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HAD NOTHING TO BE ACTIVE ABOUT
AND THE POLITICS WAS GONE.
Kearns Goodwin:
NOW HE WAS LEFT TO THIS RANCH,
BUT HE HAD TO HAVE STAFF MEETINGS IN THE MORNING
OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE GONE CRAZY.
BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE ONLY BEEN
THREE OR FOUR MEXICAN FIELD HANDS
AND HE WAS TELLING THEM WHICH TRACTORS TO FIX
AND WHICH EGGS WERE GOING TO BE LAID BY WHICH HENS ALMOST.
AND AT NIGHT HE LITERALLY COULDN'T GO TO SLEEP
UNLESS HE HAD REPORTS JUST AS HE HAD ALWAYS HAD
IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
BUT NOW IT WOULD BE HOW MANY EGGS HAD BEEN LAID
BY THESE HENS.
AND IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THE MONARCHY HAD BEEN REDUCED
TO THIS SMALL RANCH,
BUT THE HABITS HAD TO STAY THE SAME.
AND AS ALL OF THAT SADNESS SET IN,
THEN THERE WAS A CERTAIN FRENZY OF WONDERING--
WOULD HISTORY REMEMBER HIM WELL?
AND THEN, I THINK, HIS WHOLE MOOD BEGAN TO CHANGE.
Wickenden:
HE WAS EXTREMELY DEPRESSED,
AND HE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE LAST 25 YEARS.
HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE EARLY DAYS.
HE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS.
HE HAD THIS LONG WHITE HAIR, AND IT WAS ALL CURLED...
YOU KNOW, KIND OF CURLED AT THE BACK OF HIS HAIR,
AND HE LOOKED LIKE A HIPPIE.
I THINK HE CHOSE TO LOOK LIKE A HIPPIE
BECAUSE HE CONTAINED EVERYTHING.
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IDENTIFYING WITH THE KIDS
THAT HAD BEEN DEMONSTRATING AGAINST THE WAR.
MAYBE HE WAS TRYING TO SAY TO THEM, "HEY, I UNDERSTAND.
IF I'D HAVE BEEN YOUNG, I MIGHT HAVE DONE THE SAME THING."
I THINK HE DRANK HIMSELF TO DEATH
KNOWING THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DRUNK, SHOULDN'T HAVE SMOKED,
SHOULDN'T HAVE GOT OVERWEIGHT.
HE HAD THE HEART PROBLEM.
HE ALWAYS SAID THAT MEN IN THE JOHNSON FAMILY DIDN'T LIVE LONG.
AND I THINK HE JUST ASKED FOR IT
AND JUST WAITED FOR IT TO HAPPEN.
( applause )
McCullough:
ON A COLD DAY IN THE WINTER OF 1972,
JOHNSON LEFT THE SECLUSION OF HIS RANCH
AND TRAVELED TO AUSTIN
TO SPEAK ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS FOR THE LAST TIME.
Lady Bird Johnson:
HE GOT UP OUT OF HIS BED
FROM A BAD ANGINA ATTACK.
JUST PUT A POCKETFUL OF THOSE NITROGLYCERIN PILLS IN.
NOW, LET ME MAKE IT PLAIN THAT WHEN I SAY "BLACK"...
AS I DO A GOOD MANY TIMES IN THIS LITTLE STATEMENT,
I ALSO MEAN BROWN AND YELLOW AND RED
AND ALL OTHER PEOPLE WHO SUFFER DISCRIMINATION.
McPherson:
HIS HEART WAS REALLY HURTING.
AND HE...
I REMEMBER SEEING HIM POP A NITROGLYCERIN PILL.
WE KNOW HOW MUCH STILL REMAINS TO BE DONE,
AND IF OUR EFFORTS CONTINUE AND IF OUR WILL IS STRONG
AND IF OUR HEARTS ARE RIGHT
AND IF COURAGE REMAINS OUR CONSTANT COMPANION,
THEN, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I AM CONFIDENT WE SHALL OVERCOME.
( applause )
McCullough:
THIS WOULD BE THE LAST SPEECH HE WOULD EVER GIVE.
WITHIN SIX WEEKS, ON JANUARY 22, 1973,
LYNDON JOHNSON'S HEART STOPPED BEATING.
HE WAS 64 YEARS OLD.
FIVE DAYS LATER, THE VIETNAM WAR ENDED FOR AMERICA
IN A PEACE TREATY SIGNED IN PARIS.
HE WAS JUST INTERESTING AS HELL.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, COMPARED TO MOST PEOPLE
THAT KIND OF GO THROUGH LIFE BANALLY
MAKING THEIR DREADFUL MORAL POINTS OR...
OR CONDEMNING THIS OR HOPING FOR THAT OR...
OR SCRATCHING THE BACK OF THEIR HEAD,
LYNDON REALLY MOVED.
HE WAS MOVING ALL THE TIME.
THE FEW TIMES I WAS WITH HIM, IT WAS...
HE WAS JUST FUN TO BE AROUND.
AND YOU LIKED HIM, YOU LIKED HIM.
I LIKED HIM WHEN I WAS WITH HIM
MORE THAN I DID WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT HIM.
(laughing)
JIMMY CARTER:
I promised you four years ago that I would never lie to you, so I can't stand here tonight and say it doesn't hurt.
About an hour ago, I called Governor Reagan in California and I congratulated him for a fine victory.
I look forward to working closely with him...
MAN:
All his life he believed that if you worked hard enough at it, understood the issues, mastered information then you would come out first.
I said to him, "It must have been hard to turn over the keys to Ronald Reagan,"
and he said, "You don't know how hard it was."
NARRATOR:
On January 20, 1981, after one of the most humiliating defeats in American political history,
President Jimmy Carter returned home to Plains, Georgia, to what he called, "An altogether new, unwanted and potentially empty life."
ROSALYNN CARTER:
He really was better than I was when we came home because, um, I was so depressed about it that he was always trying to prop me up.
(crowd cheering, applauding )
NARRATOR:
Four years before, he had stunned the nation.
(cheering )
MAN:
Going from total anonymity to being president of the United States in less than 12 months is unprecedented in American history.
If it weren't for the country looking for something in '76, uh, Carter could never have gotten elected.
MAN:
He offered a biography of what we wanted to hear-- a farmer, Main Street values, Plains-- and he carried that message through.
It was the right message at the right time.
CARTER:
Our commitment to human rights st be absolute.
NARRATOR:
He had promised a new beginning to heal the wounds of Watergate and Vietnam-- a government as good and decent and compassionate as the American people.
(crowd chanting )
But events would overwhelm him-- an energy crisis, inflation, an Islamic revolution, and 53 Americans held hostage 444 days.
Carter came to be regarded as a good and decent man who was in over his head.
WOMAN:
He's a very, very smart man, and very well-intentioned but feel, feel is ve, very important in politics, especially in a president, and Carter just didn't have very much of it.
What he had was a moral ideology and the issues where he proved successful-- the Panama Canal treaties, the human rights crusades, peace in the Middle East-- those were issues where his moral ideology guided him.
In a nation that was proud of hard work...
NARRATOR:
"Carter was one of the more exasperating men ever to claim the White House," one journalist said.
"His tenacity, so admirable, could shift to stubbornness,
"his religious faith to self-righteousness.
His brilliant mind could be bound up by intricate details."
Many times the one argument that I would find would ruin a person's case is when he'd say, "This is good for you,olitically."
He didn't want to hear that.
He didn't want to think that way and he didn't want his staff to think that way.
He wanted to know what's right.
MAN:
This is one of the most highly ambitious people you'll ever meet.
I mean, you don't make it from Plains, Georgia, to the White House just on charm.
But what makes him complex is he's got that kind of hubris and arrogance and also this Christian humbleness and that's the battle he's constantly finding himself in.
NARRATOR:
"As a child, my greatest ambition was to be valuable around the farm and to please my father,"
Jimmy Carter wrote of his boyhood in rural Georgia.
"He was the center of my life and the focus of my admiration."
MAN:
I can't believe that Jimmy Carter ever felt lost, in the sensehat he didn't know where his place was in the world.
And a lot of that comes from his father who not only was a well-respected, powerful figure in the community, but I think had a real sense of who he was.
And that certitude and self-confidence was something that his son, I think, absorbed unconsciously.
NARRATOR:
By the standards of southwest Georgia,
Earl Carter presided over a small empire.
A staunch segregationist, he owned some 350 acres of land where he planted corn, cotton and peanuts, employing more than 200 workers at harvest time.
Five sharecropper families, who depended on him for their survival, lived year-round at his farm in Archery.
WOMAN:
Earl was the boss in Archery.
The workers were all black, the maids who did the cooking and took care of Jimmy were black and at the top of the system was Earl Carter.
NARRATOR:
From a position of privilege,
Earl's children-- Jimmy, Gloria and Ruth-- became acquainted with the ways of the Jim Crow South.
"More than anyone else in my family-- even my own father--
"I understood the plight of the black families because I lived so much among them," Carter later wrote.
He often ate and slept in the homes of his black neighbors and played with their children.
MAN:
The interesting thing about the South is that we played together, black and white, when we were seven, eight, nine, ten, but then when you got to be a teenager, all of a sudden, uh, segregation set in.
NARRATOR:
"One day, my friends and I approached a gate,"
Carter would later recall.
"To my surprise, they stepped back to let me go through first."
(gate creaking )
"It was a small act, but a deeply symbolic one.
Things were never the same between them and me."
MEN:
♪ I got a road
♪ You got a road
♪ All of God's children got a road. ♪
NARRATOR:
"A strong memory in my mind is coming home and my mother not being there," he wrote.
DAN CARTER:
There's a very deep tradition in southern society of the caretaker mother figure who is responsible not only for her family but outside of it, as well.
Well, those...
those people exist in almost every southern, rural community, but Miss Lillian took it a step further than that.
NARRATOR:
Carter's mother, Lillian, was an avid reader, loved traveling and was known to enjoy a sip of bourbon.
She put in long hours as a nurse at a nearby hospital, and devoted much of her free time to helping sick neighbors, regardless of race.
She got paid in chickens and vegetables and that kind of things because she really helped and felt called to help those that had less than her, and I think she instilled that in all of her children.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
She was the only person in Plains who would take up for Abraham Lincoln if he was ever brought up.
Today it's unbelievable to think about that, but back then it was just a way of life, and we never thought anything... we never thought it was really wrong.
NARRATOR:
Lillian set for Jimmy the example of service to others.
Earl put the steel in his character.
GLAD:
He was very demanding.
He expected his, uh, children to be the very best, and, um, and in some ways they all had that built into them.
NARRATOR:
"I never remember him saying 'good job' when I did my best to fulfill his orders," Jimmy later said.
"The punishments he administered remain vivid in my memory."
A short distance from the Carter farm was Plains, Georgia-- population 600-- the only place for miles to get a cup of coffee, a haircut, buy or sell goods.
It is the place Jimmy Carter always called home, where as a child he went to the all-white Baptist church on Sundays and where he attended the all-white public school.
DAN CARTER:
Everybody knew that he was special.
He was somebody different, smarter than, worked harder than, did more than, ceaselessly working at improving himself, even as a child.
NARRATOR:
Jimmy made all As.
He played basketball and joined the book lover's club, read Shakespeare'sKing Lear,
Ben-Hur, The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
He dreamed of joining the navy.
His uncle Tom Gordy had excited his imagination with tales of adventures, and postcards and gifts from exotic, faraway places.
Earl encouraged Jimmy to pursue his dream.
GLAD:
It was a way that many young southern men got the polish, got the education that would make them a part of either the local elite or the national elite.
NARRATOR:
Jimmy reviewed the strict requirements of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis and worried he wasn't good enough.
He thought his feet were flat and rolled them over Coke bottles to strengthen the arches.
He thought he was too thin, and went on a banana diet.
He even went to a local college for two years to study the required courses.
"He just wouldn't quit,"
Jimmy's uncle Alton would later say.
"That boy just wouldn't give up on anything."
In June 1943, at age 18, the farm boy from Plains was admitted to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis-- the first Carter ever to leave Georgia to pursue a higher education.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
Jimmy's sister Ruth was my best friend and she had a picture of him on the wall in her bedroom.
I just thought he was the most handsome young man I had ever seen.
One day I confessed to her that I wished she would let me take that photograph home, because I just thought I had fallen in love with Jimmy Carter.
NARRATOR:
Rosalynn Smith was shy, a dedicated student, read the Bible daily and went to church on Sundays.
Her mother once described her as a girl who could wear a white dress all day and keep it clean.
MAN:
She was very bright.
She was a reader.
She liked to look at maps.
She was always interested in seeing the world and, uh, she always wanted to get away.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
I went to a meeting at the church and I was standing outside and Jimmy drove up with Ruth and her boyfriend, got out of the car and came up and asked me to go to the movie.
He kissed me good-bye.
I was thrilled to death, and then we started corresponding and, uh, by the time Christmas came, I was swept off my feet.
NARRATOR:
One month after his graduation from Annapolis,
Jimmy and Rosalynn were married.
She was 18, he was 21.
The Carters began married life in Norfolk, Virginia, where the navy lieutenant first reported for duty.
The children arrived in quick succession--
Jack one year after their wedding,
James Earl, or Chip, less than three years later in Hawaii and a third, Jeff, born in New London, Connecticut.
With her husband away at sea, Rosalynn found herself alone and in charge of all the affairs of the Carter household.
"I felt inadequate and very lonely," she later said.
"Sometimes I cried, though I didn't let Jimmy know.
"He has no patience with tears,
"thinking instead that one makes the best of whatever situation, and with a smile."
ROSALYNN CARTER:
I learned to be very independent.
I could take care of myself and the baby and... and do things that I never dreamed I would be able to do alone.
NARRATOR:
Two years after joining the navy,
Ensign Carter was accepted into the submarine service.
It was a way to advance rapidly in a highly competitive environment.
MAN:
The military was everything for Jimmy Carter.
It's his training.
He's never a minute late for anything.
Punctuality means everything.
His sense of order...
There's no sense of a mess around Jimmy Carter.
It's a certain kind of person that works in a submarine.
It takes a kind of mental discipline.
NARRATOR:
While the rest of the officers lingered after dinner or settled in for a long game of bridge or poker, his shipmates remembered Carter would read a book, solve a sonar problem-- always something constructive.
"I mastered the assignments that I had,"
Carter would say of his naval career.
"Got the best fitness reports and I never put in for anything that I did not get."
ANNOUNCER (on tape ):
She's coming up out of the deep-- theSeawolf.
NARRATOR:
After six years in the service,
Lieutenant Carter earned one of the most coveted posts in the navy-- senior officer of the USSSeawolf, on the vanguard of America's nuclear defense program.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
He always had one of the best positions in the navy, and I think it gave him a lot of confidence that he could do whatever he wanted to do.
NARRATOR:
In 1953, less than a year after he began duty on theSeawolf,
Carter received a message from home.
His father had cancer and was not expected to live long.
Ten years had passed since Carter left Plains for a career in the navy.
Visits home had been rare.
Father and son had grown distant.
As he sat by Earl's bedside,
Jimmy discovered a side of his father he'd never seen before.
"Our long conversations were interrupted by a stream of visitors, black and white," Carter later wrote.
"A surprising number wanted to recount
"how my father's personal influence
"and many secret acts of generosity had affected their lives."
GLAD:
He saw that he had really built a community around himself.
A lot of people liked him and, uh, came to see him when he was sick and when he died, came to his funeral.
And what Jimmy realized, he didn't have a community for himself.
He's actually said to me, "You know," he said,
"I wondered at that time, if I died,
"how many people would come to my funeral or how many people would care if I died."
And I think it made him, at a fairly fundamental level, examine what life is all about.
NARRATOR:
Duty also weighed on Carter.
Miss Lillian had no interest in the business and Ruth and Gloria had married.
His brother, Billy, just 16, was mad as hell when told his older brother would be stepping in.
BRINKLEY:
He was a shining star in the U.S. Navy who could have gone very, very far.
He dropped all that to emulate his father, to take over his father's business.
I don't think there's any higher tribute a son could make to his father than to say, "Now that you're dead, Daddy,
I want to stand in your shoes."
NARRATOR:
When Jimmy told Rosalynn, she was furious.
"She almost quit me," he later said.
CHIP CARTER:
Mom was kind of disappointed to be going back to Plains and she had worked a good bit of her life to get out of there and, uh, they were going back to take over a... a business
that wasn't doing very well.
BRINKLEY:
Rosalynn had finally got out of that flyspeck village, and had gotten to see the bright lights and big cities.
Imagine being based in Hawaii where you get a Pacific breeze and palm trees and the smell of the Orient in the air, and now you're back in the suffocating, mosquito-plagued humidity of Plains, Georgia.
She pleaded with him not to go.
BOURNE:
She had seen a very nice life ahead of them, and then he wanted to give that all up, and go back and become a peanut farmer and she was just really angry.
And she literally did not talk to him the whole way back to Plains.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
I pouted for about year.
Not really, but I was just the total mother and wife.
It was tough for a while.
CHIP CARTER:
We loved it.
Plains is a place where at six or seven, eight years old, you can go off by yourself.
We spent every afternoon after school in the woods playing hide-and-seek and building forts and fishing and hiking and that kind of thing.
It was just a great way to grow up.
(crowd angrily yelling )
NARRATOR:
Only a year after their return home, the Carters were thrust into the turmoil sweeping across the South.
In 1954, the Supreme Court outlawed segregation in public schools.
White Southerners, organized into white citizens' councils, vowed to resist.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
Jimmy was approached by one of the prominent businessmen asking him to join the White Citizens' Council and he told him that it only cost five dollars to join and that he would be glad to pay his dues.
I think Jimmy told him he could flush his money down the john.
But anyway, Jimmy refused to do that and we lost some customers.
DAN CARTER:
I won't say it was a profile in full courage, but it was not an act of discretion.
You had to carefully think about and it required, at the very least, a kind of independence of thought and in some respects a kind of, uh, courage to say "No.
This I won't do."
NARRATOR:
Carter applied all his energies to peanuts.
"He was always experimenting," Rosalynn later wrote.
"Trying new things, dreaming up something else he wanted to do."
As the business expanded, he turned to Rosalynn for help.
CHIP CARTER:
Mom is not really the type to join the stitch-and-chat and to sit around and be content with that.
Part of their uniqueness is that they're partners in everything and I think a lot of that started back then, to make her a part of what was happening so that she would really have something to be proud of.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
He asked me to come and keep the office.
And I had a friend who taught an accounting course in a vocational-technical school, and she gave me a set of accounting books.
I began to study accounting.
I began to keep the books, and it was not too long before I knew... actually... as much or more about the... the business, uh, on paper, uh, than he did.
CHIP CARTER:
I started working there when I was nine.
We worked in the warehouse during peanut season.
Peanut season was a very heavy time.
Sometimes we worked 50 hours straight.
I think that he worked hard.
Um, he tried to instill it in his children.
He obeyed his father, jumped when he spoke.
We did the same thing.
(motor whirring )
NARRATOR:
"I had to admit I was enjoying life," Rosalynn later said.
The Carters went fishing, played golf, took frequent vacations.
(no audio )
Jimmy served on the Sumter County Board of Education, taught Sunday School at the Plains Baptist Church, was scoutmaster, vice president of the Lions Club.
"But he had come to the point of boredom," Rosalynn remembered.
"And one weekday morning in 1962, he got up and put on his Sunday pants."
ROSALYNN CARTER:
I was really shocked.
I had no idea he was thinking about running for the state senate.
NARRATOR:
The campaign that launched Jimmy Carter's political career lasted all of 15 days.
There was no money and no staff-- only family and friends and his own determination.
Though he would always play the reluctant politician, even by his first campaign,
Carter was no stranger to politics.
DAN CARTER:
Politics was something he lived and breathed from the time he was a child-- a kind of weekly, daily, even during election season interaction, barbecues.
You gathered on the county courthouse grounds for speeches.
He talks about going to rallies with his father and remembering them very well.
And I think he came to see politics as something not alien, not something he had to make a decision to do, but was almost natural.
NARRATOR:
"I received a startling education," he said,
"One that set the tone for my future career."
Quitman County, historically, had been run by a man named Joe Hurst and Joe was not atypical for many, many small counties in the state-- the poorer counties.
You had one person who was a political power, who just in effect kind of ran the county.
NARRATOR:
Hurst was used to getting what he wanted, and in 1962, he wanted another democrat,
Homer Moore, to be elected senator.
FORTSON:
The ballot box was a liquor box, that had been taken and, uh, a hole cut in the top of it so that you put your ballot over in there after you, and was set up on the counter, and you had to come up
and... and mark your ballot right next to it with Joe and a bunch of his crowd watching, you know, while you're doing it.
NARRATOR:
Fraud was rampant.
Voters were threatened, ballots destroyed.
Joe Hurst even stuffed ballots of dead voters into the Old Crow box.
That evening when the votes were counted, Jimmy Carter had lost.
He decided to contest the election.
DAN CARTER:
By all accounts, even allowing for a certain hyperbole in the memory of Mr. Carter, this required an extraordinary kind of doggedness in just keeping at it and keeping at it and not giving up.
NARRATOR:
Carter appealed to newspapers, filed for injunctions, took affidavits from voters.
Miss Lillian kept saying, "Jimmy is so naive... so naive."
There were threats against the Carters.
Jimmy was followed.
A stranger came by the Carter warehouse and warned Rosalynn that the last time anyone had crossed Joe Hurst, their business had burned down.
"I was constantly scared," she later said.
"Jimmy was frightened, too."
Two weeks later, a local judge agreed to hear Carter's case.
FORTSON:
When it came time to open that box and recount it, right there, rolled up into a ball, were all these ballots, and Judge Crow was a... a funny fellow.
He chewed tobacco, and he had just cut off a little piece of tobacco and put it in his mouth, and he was kind of putting it around, and I was...
I saw that and I saw him cut his eyes, stop chewing, and then go back to chewing and sit back, and right then is when I knew we had that thing won.
NARRATOR:
On January 14, 1963, the morning after the traditional whiskey and barbecued wild hog dinner,
Jimmy Carter was sworn in as a member of the Georgia Senate.
He was one of 89 new legislators joining the Georgia Assembly, many of them determined to change the old ways of Georgia politics.
MAN:
I had the good fortune of being the first black to be elected to the General Assembly of Georgia in 100 years.
Carter was one of those persons who came to the Senate at that time, and he was not a leader of the Senate.
He was quiet.
He was effective.
He was deliberate... and he made no waves.
NARRATOR:
Carter opposed special interests and sweetheart deals.
He worked hard and read every bill, staying away from drinking sprees and poker games.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
In the last session of the state senate in his last year there,
I was standing in the back of the senate chamber with him and the lieutenant governor was going on and on and on, and it was bedlam, like the last day.
And Jimmy said, "If I were lieutenant governor, this wouldn't be happening."
And I thought, "Uh-oh, he's really enjoying this."
NARRATOR:
In 1966, after two terms in the Georgia Senate,
Jimmy Carter jumped into the race for governor of Georgia.
He ran well behind arch- segregationist Lester Maddox, famous for wielding an ax handle to keep blacks away from his chicken restaurant.
Carter left his younger brother, Billy, in charge of the business, while the rest of the family went on the road.
CHIP CARTER:
I think I had $25 a week for expenses to eat on, and I had a gas credit card.
And we came in every Saturday night and told what we'd been doing.
It was a real education for all of us and we were doing it as a family.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
I would come home and ask him questions that people asked me while I was campaigning and that I didn't know the answers to.
And he would give me the answers so I could go back out and talk about issues.
He had confidence in me to do the things that I needed to do.
NARRATOR:
Carter promised better schools, better hospitals, better roads, and a more competent government.
"It is hard to hear
"Senator Carter talk about state government and not be impressed by his integrity," one reporter wrote.
DAN CARTER:
You're not going to turn the applecart upside down, but you're going to bring changes, you're going to bring improvements in the South and you're going to do it by applying good, sound business techniques to everything--
from the way you run your public institutions to the way you run your government.
NARRATOR:
Carter took his message to every corner of Georgia.
"We never stopped," Rosalynn recalled, "no matter what."
By election day, he was closing in on the lead.
CHIP CARTER:
We went to bed thinking we were going to win.
I'd gotten up and gone to school the next day, being congratulated about my father winning the primary, and then Billy came to the...
about 2:00 in the afternoon and told us that Lester Maddox had beat us by less than a half of a percentage point.
So, it was very disheartening.
NARRATOR:
"We all felt sick," Rosalynn recalled.
"We were $66,000 in debt, and Jimmy had lost 22 pounds."
After all the miles traveled, the handshakes, the long days,
Jimmy Carter was right back where he started when he first ran for the Senate in 1962.
Weeks later, with the loss still fresh in his mind,
Jimmy went for a walk with his sister Ruth, an evangelical Christian and a spiritual healer.
All of his life he had been a churchgoing Christian, but now felt that his faith had been superficial.
"We are both Baptists," he said,
"but what is it that you have that I haven't got?"
"Total commitment," she replied.
"I belong to Jesus-- everything I am."
"Ruth," he answered, "that's what I want."
BRINKLEY:
At that point he decided that he'd always put Christ in his life first and politics second.
But that's been a struggle for him, because politics is the ego, and Christ is the humbleness.
NARRATOR:
The born-again Christian traveled North to blighted neighborhoods in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts as a "personal witness" for Jesus Christ.
BRINKLEY:
He would go door to door, getting people to witness Christ, take Jesus into their lives.
I mean, can you imagine?
Ten years later this man is president of the United States, and he's banging on doors, asking people, Do you want a bible?
Will you take God in your life?
He wanted to understand theology and so he began reading a lot of theologians and began to craft for himself a political theology that was compatible with his own personality.
NARRATOR:
Carter found guidance in the writings of theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.
GODBOLD:
Niebuhr said, "The sad duty of politics is to bring justice to a sinful world."
A Christian has to get involved in politics.
He has to soil his hands as a politician or in an immoral society, in order to improve it.
BRINKLEY:
Niebuhr taught him that there is good and evil in the world, and that politics is corrupt, but it's honorable, as long as you kept your heart pure and your sense of morality pure.
NARRATOR:
"I believe God wants me to be the best politician I can be,"
he said.
I'm Jimmy Carter, I'm running for governor.
How are you?
NARRATOR:
In 1970, with renewed fervor,
Carter ran for governor of Georgia a second time.
I have been campaigning almost 18 hours a day without stopping for eight months.
I've seen almost every factory shift in Georgia, been in almost every store...
ROSALYNN CARTER:
It was just kind of an obsession.
He had lost, so he had to win.
And we worked as hard as we could.
Bye.
Hi, all.
NARRATOR:
It would not be the amateur run of 1966, but a well-coordinated effort.
Carter brought in two Southwest Georgia boys:
Jody Powell as his personal assistant, and Hamilton Jordan to manage the campaign.
Advertising man Gerald Rafshoon would handle the media.
Bert Lance, a banker from Calhoun, played the role of advisor.
MAN:
...though it was a tough, tough campaign and there were many who thought that Carter could not possibly win.
NARRATOR:
Carter's rival for the Democratic nomination--
Carl Sanders-- enjoyed a commanding 20% lead.
He had the backing of the Atlanta business establishment, and the support of African Americans, voting in greater numbers since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Carter went after Sanders with a vengeance.
TELEVISION ANNOUNCER:
Some candidates in this governor's race have large campaign contributions behind them.
Big money asking big favors.
Jimmy Carter only has the people of Georgia...
NARRATOR:
Carter portrayed Sanders as a tool of the Atlanta business establishment and himself as a hard-working Everyman.
ANNOUNCER:
No wonder Jimmy Carter has a special understanding of the problems facing everyone who works for a living.
Isn't it time somebody spoke up for you?
GODBOLD:
He wanted to appeal to the large middle-class, blue-collar type, predominantly white, and most of these people are going to be segregationists.
GLAD:
He courted the racist vote!
There were some radio ads that he ran in 1970.
He said that "Unlike Sanders, I am not trying to get the..."
and he sort of slid over whether it was "block" or "black" vote.
But it sort of meant the same thing.
GODBOLD:
Carter himself was not a segregationist in 1970.
But he did say things that the segregationists wanted to hear.
He was opposed to busing.
He was in favor of private schools.
He said that he would invite segregationist Governor George Wallace to come to Georgia to give a speech.
JOHNSON:
The only solace that we got and received was the fact that, in private meetings, he convinced us that if he was given an opportunity, he would make things better.
He'd always come up with this question of trust.
"Trust me.
I believe in doing the right thing."
GLAD:
If you are really trying to accomplish good moral ends, you may have to be a low-life politician to get there.
And he didn't probably like doing it that much, but he was willing to do it.
(rifle fires, crowd applauds )
(rifle fires )
CARTER:
At the end of a long campaign, I believe I know our people...
NARRATOR:
On January 12, 1971,
Jimmy Carter, age 46, was sworn in as Governor of Georgia.
North and South, rural and urban...
NARRATOR:
In his inaugural address, he revealed his true feelings on race.
I say to you quite frankly, that the time for racial discrimination is over.
(light applause )
No poor, rural, weak or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity of an education, a job or simple justice.
(moderate applause;
light whistling )
JOHNSON:
We were extremely pleased.
Many of the white segregationists were displeased.
And I'm convinced that those people that supported him, would not have supported him if they had thought that he would have made that statement.
DAN CARTER:
I do remember reading his inaugural address and thinking, This is wonderful.
We've got a governor in a Deep South state who is stating emphatically not just that it's time to accept change, but that it's time to really move far beyond that and end all forms of discrimination.
I suddenly saw him as part of this new generation of southern politicians who were moving beyond the divisions of racial politics in the 1950s and 1960s.
NARRATOR:
The Carters moved into the brand-new governor's mansion, on 18 acres in Atlanta's poshest district.
CARTER:
This is the first time our family has really been together for the last four years.
Our oldest boy has just gotten back from the Navy and I've been campaigning for four years, so we're looking forward to living as a family again.
MAN:
Mrs. Carter, have you had any special problems?
No, not really.
We packed the clothes in the car last night.
And really, the only furniture we had to bring was one sofa, which is just a favorite, old sofa that my children love.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
Going from Plains, Georgia, to the governor's mansion was much harder for me than going from the governor's mansion to the White House.
I had never, ever been in the governor's mansion.
Um, when Jimmy was in the state senate,
I didn't come to Atlanta, because I was working at home.
I was not part of the Atlanta political community.
It was a really difficult experience.
CHIP CARTER:
She had to learn her own voice, how to project, how to make a speech, how to win people over, how to deal with legislators on her issues.
She had to learn how to do all that.
NARRATOR:
The people of Georgia came to meet the new first family, and fell in love with Amy, the Carters' three-year-old daughter.
GODBOLD:
The public identifies with a small child, and Carter understood that, and they kept Amy in the limelight.
It made him human.
He could be a successful politician, a successful governor and a successful father all at the same time.
NARRATOR:
Carter appointed an unprecedented number of women and African Americans, stimulated foreign investment, reformed the state's criminal justice and mental health systems.
I see unfair taxes and government waste and I see runaway spending...
NARRATOR:
The centerpiece of his agenda was a radical plan to streamline state government with savings at every level.
LANCE:
Everybody had to pay for their own lunch.
You know, we had to put two dollars into the kitty.
Mary Beasley, who was his secretary at the time, would ask you want you wanted, so you felt honored to be able to go ahead and spend money for a dried-out sandwich.
NARRATOR:
The governor's proposal to slash the number of government agencies provoked outrage.
CARTER:
I welcome the confrontation with heads of departments.
You know, I'm willing to fight with anybody who opposes a recommendation that would be helpful to...
JOHNSON:
I saw a completely different side of Carter.
In the Senate, he was not assertive.
As governor, he was assertive.
He knew where he wanted to go, and he knew the direction he wanted to go in.
And he wanted complete compliance.
He's fighting for total submission and total control of the legislators, and he's willing to use 100 million or 200 million or whatever it is...
FORTSON:
Jimmy's character is such that he wants to get things done.
He wants them done.
And he has a tendency, I think, to run roughshod over anything that stands in his way.
We need to remember who pays the taxes and who pays our salaries.
DAN CARTER:
He had a tendency to take his case to the people and then try to force the legislature to follow him.
CARTER:
Or the welfare recipient...
DAN CARTER:
He never, as governor, broke what I think was an unfortunate habit of seeing personal politics, as a kind of-- that is, with other politicians-- as a kind of nuisance, something that had to be done
because you had to talk to these people.
He never developed the interest in-- or really particularly good skills-- at working with individuals who may have disagreed with him.
CARTER:
...where you pay more than $312.50 a month.
NARRATOR:
By the time his reorganization bill reached the Senate floor,
Carter had alienated most of the assembly.
But his bill squeaked through by a handful of votes.
FORTSON:
As I told the committee up there, he reminds me of a South Georgia turtle who's been blocked by a log.
And he just keeps pushing, pushing, pushing straight ahead.
He doesn't go around here until he finally gets a soft spot in the log, and right on through he goes.
He is a man of great determination and steel.
NARRATOR:
Election season 1972, Jimmy Carter extended his hospitality to Democratic hopefuls.
Barely two years in the governor's mansion, he already had his eye on the White House.
CHIP CARTER:
Every Democrat running for office came to Georgia.
And every single one of them, Dad would ask to come and stay with him at the governor's mansion, and realize that they were just people like him.
NARRATOR:
That July, Carter led the Georgia delegation to the Democratic National Convention, hoping for the second spot on the ticket.
I'm over here in the box and I really can't tell what's going on so much.
But Jimmy comes over from the floor and briefs me every once in a while.
As you said, it's the first time I've ever been to a convention and I'm just so excited about it.
MAN:
I remember at the end of the McGovern speech, at 3:00 in the morning,
Hamilton Jordan and I were walking away from the convention hall.
I said, "You know...
"if Ed Muskie, Hubert Humphrey, Terry Sanford,
"Scoop Jackson, George Wallace,
"Ted Kennedy can run for president,
Jimmy could run for president"
And then of course we said,
"If these guys who are running these campaigns"-- like we met the people in the McGovern campaign--
"can run a campaign for president, hell, we could do that."
I called Ruth.
I said, "Jimmy's going to run for p-p-..."
I couldn't even say the word, it was so... unreal to me.
I'm one of about 15 or 20 people in the country who... active in the Democratic party who have been mentioned for a place on the ticket next year.
NARRATOR:
Carter's timing was perfect.
For the next two years,
Americans would be gripped by the Watergate scandal.
Disillusioned with politics, they were ready for a change.
...until after the November election.
RAFSHOON:
It was 1970... early '74.
I went over to see him one night.
Rosalynn was out of town.
I went over to the governor's mansion and I said,
Let's just talk about what the themes would be.
And he took a yellow pad and he wrote:
fairness, not from Washington, not a lawyer, Southerner, religious.
These things that were coming from Carter were the themes of the campaign.
Jimmy who?
Jimmy Carter?
I don't know who he is.
Carter is a basketball player, isn't he?
(campaign music playing )
NARRATOR:
Carter officially announced his candidacy in December 1974.
The one-term southern governor, was a long shot.
Nobody knew him.
It was like picking a name out of the phone book.
I mean, it takes a bit of hubris to think you're the best person to be the president of the United States because you were a one-term governor of Georgia.
MAN:
♪ Once and for all, why not the best?
♪
BRINKLEY:
It's a kind of arrogance run amuck.
MAN:
♪ You see his name was Jimmy Carter... ♪
CARTER:
I want to see us once again have a nation that's as good and honest and decent and truthful and competent and compassionate... and as filled with love as are the American people.
MAN:
At that time character was a monumental issue.
The country had been through a horrible time and Jimmy Carter represented honesty and decency.
CARTER:
I will never tell a lie.
I'll never make a misleading statement.
I'll never betray the confidence that any of you has in me.
BRINKLEY:
Lyndon Johnson lied to us about Vietnam.
Richard Nixon lied to us about Watergate.
He's saying, you know, I'm not one of those turkeys who's messing things up up there.
(Allman Brothers' "Ramblin Man" playing )
♪ Lord, I was born a ramblin' man... ♪
NARRATOR:
Carter's campaign strategy was simple:
run early and run hard.
Before any other candidates even announced,
Carter had traveled more than 50,000 miles, visited 37 states and delivered more than 200 speeches.
BOURNE:
He was a wonderful speaker before small groups.
He would get up and talk, without notes, with extraordinary passion.
Almost like a preacher, really having the spirit with him.
NARRATOR:
It was a grassroots effort financed on a shoestring.
CHIP CARTER:
We had all these stepping stones we had to do.
We had to qualify for federal matching funds by a certain point.
And we accomplished every one of them.
When you accomplished one, it gave you more confidence.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
We had our boys out, we had Aunt Sissy out, we had his mother-- all going in different directions.
CHIP CARTER:
At one point in the presidential campaign we had 11 family members in 11 different states at the same time.
("Ramblin Man" continues )
NARRATOR:
The first test came in January 1976.
With no delegates at stake, other candidates wrote off the Iowa caucuses, but Carter saw them as a way to surface early and gain the attention of the press.
Iowa put Carter on the political map, and gave him momentum heading into a field of better-known Democrats.
ALLMAN BROTHERS:
♪ On my way to New Orleans this mornin'... ♪
NARRATOR:
Mo Udall, Birch Bayh, Sargent Shriver-- in the all-important New Hampshire primary.
MAN:
We had almost a month between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, which gave us time to build on the win, both in terms of recognition and coverage and in terms of raising just enough money to make it through New Hampshire and have a bit left over.
NARRATOR:
Campaign volunteers from Georgia-- the "Peanut Brigade"-- descended on the Granite State.
CHIP CARTER:
We were out every day, knocking on doors.
We knocked on 60,000 doors in New Hampshire.
That was probably almost every Democratic household that we could identify in the whole state.
Hello.
Are you Mrs. Cobb?
Yes, yes.
I'm Dot Padgett...
WOMAN:
You'd say, "Mrs. Smith?
My name is Betty Pope, and I'm from Americus, Georgia.
And if Mrs. Smith was there with her dog,
I would remember that this beautiful lab came to the door with her.
So I'd make a note and I'd talk to her a little bit about Jimmy, and often it was, "Have you ever met him?"
And of course, that's why we were there.
So we did get our name out.
And I think that we surprised America when he won.
WALTER CRONKITE:
Jimmy Carter took a long lead tonight in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
He won the New Hampshire primary handily.
(applause )
I remember when we couldn't find a microphone.
(crowd laughs and cheers )
NARRATOR:
The next crucial contest was Florida.
The leading contender, George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, was an outspoken segregationist who had become a liability to the Democratic Party.
MAN:
We'd run a Northerner that was right on civil rights, and George Wallace would steal a third of our vote and we couldn't get elected.
Here came along a man from the South, with very good civil rights credentials, who just might be able to handle George Wallace.
NARRATOR:
As a native son, Carter could appeal to white voters.
He also had the support of African-American leaders.
CHIP CARTER:
Martin Luther King, Sr., had endorsed us.
Andy Young was on our team.
Great civil rights leaders here in Atlanta were behind us, others that got to know us.
It was a real asset to us.
YOUNG:
All of the liberals that I had worked with got nervous in a room full of black people.
And Jimmy Carter didn't.
He was very comfortable, very relaxed.
When I talked with him I realized that he read more, he was more disciplined, more organized, his personal life was more meaningful, his religion was really way down deep in the marrow of his bones.
And... and I said, you know, "That's the kind of guy that ought to be running this country."
NARRATOR:
Most candidates stayed away from Florida-- confident the little-known Georgian could be dealt with later.
DAN CARTER:
There really was an underestimation of Carter from the beginning in that '76 campaign.
And he took advantage of that repeatedly.
Carter in no way played the southern rube, but there was a little bit of this sneaking up on everybody.
By decisively defeating George Wallace, he not only succeeded in doing what the liberals wanted him to do, but transforming himself into a really powerful, major candidate.
GLAD:
What the liberals had not realized is that by the time of Florida,
Jimmy Carter would have won Iowa, would have won New Hampshire, and would have this huge retinue of press following him around.
And he was the man to beat.
NARRATOR:
Carter's stamina seemed superhuman.
"Behind that Huckleberry Finn grin," one reporter observed,
"there is a perfectionist campaign machine that shuts down only six hours out of 24."
State by state, the delegates kept adding up.
By the time the Democrats convened in New York, in July 1976, Carter had a lock on the nomination.
(band plays "We Shall Overcome" )
MONDALE:
The fact that Carter could unite the nation, North and South, and give us a clean shot for the Presidency-- this was the culmination of my dreams.
My name is Jimmy Carter and I'm running for President.
(applause and cheering )
And now I've come here...
to accept your nomination.

GLAD:
He'd pulled off a miracle.
In the fall of 1975, he was barely visible as a candidate, below five percent in all the polls.
And suddenly, six months later, he has the Democratic presidential nomination, and he is running 70% in the public opinion polls.
That is a miracle.
Now, the problem was that he had his vulnerabilities, and they showed in the fall.
Okay, gang, let's go around.
NARRATOR:
In the summer of 1976, with a huge lead in the polls the Democratic candidate could relax.
(people cheer )
The press descended on Plains, eager to learn about the peanut farmer who might become president, and the remote southern town he called home.
GLAD:
It was thought out and carefully planned by the campaign committee.
As Jody Powell said, our campaign was not really about issues.
It was about blue skies, where everybody knew each other, and no pollution.
That was it all the way.
And so going into Plains you see blue skies, you see everybody in town seemed to love Jimmy.
Everybody was enthusiastic about him.
So it was perfect.
POWELL:
This was who he was.
This is where he came from.
The people in that town clearly saw him as one of them.
That was a tremendous asset.
POPE:
When you're campaigning, every little picture in the paper, every little something, is free publicity.
So we were trying to impress the people and trying to let them know what the real Plains was like.
We went and took this empty depot and steam-cleaned it and we brought furniture from our homes and pictures off the walls.
Everybody just cooperated and wanted to help.
NARRATOR:
Back home, surrounded by family and friends,
Carter would display his best qualities.
GLAD:
You would go to the church on Sunday, and there would be Jimmy and he'd have the lesson for the day and he'd outline something.
One time, he came out and he had underlined
"The Baptists believe in the separation of church and state."
So he was safe on church issues.
You might go out to the pond house and hear Jimmy Carter come out and say what he just heard from a group of experts, and like an A student in a seminar, tell you what everybody said with great clarity.
REPORTER:
Following that up, are you saying that...
GLAD:
And if you asked him a tough question, he got those cold blue eyes, and reporters would just shudder with delight:
that look!
And so you...
what you could see, he'd be a tough son-of-a-bitch.
So not only was he moral, and did he have all these people love him, but he would be tough.
NARRATOR:
Carter's eccentric family provided color.
Sister Gloria rode a Harley Davidson and was a born-again Christian.
Sister Ruth was a Charismatic Christian and popular faith healer.
And holding forth at his filling station across from the depot was Billy, Carter's hard-drinking brother.
BILLY CARTER:
My big advantage?
Sam Donaldson was against me.
POPE:
Brother Billy-- he was a sport.
He was a very good businessman, and he was extremely colorful.
And he was much brighter, much more learned and well read than most people think.
He read a book every day and had over 20,000 in his library stashed up in his attic when he died.
WOMAN:
Smile, Billy.
CHIP CARTER:
Billy ended up with a reputation and then he tried to live up to it.
MAN:
All right.
(camera clicks and whirrs )
NARRATOR:
Of all the Carters, it was the irrepressible Miss Lillian who best reflected on Jimmy.
Since her husband's death, she had lived life on her own terms.
Always committed to helping the poor, she had joined the Peace Corps and spent two years in India.
BRINKLEY:
There's that wonderful story of Miss Lillian when one reporter woman from New York came down to Plains and Miss Lillian greeted her and said, you know, "Welcome to Plains."
You know, "It's so nice to see you.
"Would you like some lemonade?
"How was your journey?
Your dress is beautiful."
You know, pouring on the Southern hospitality.
And the reporter jumped right in on Miss Lillian and said,
"Now, Miss Lillian, your son is running for president
"saying he'll never tell a lie.
As a mother, are you telling me he's never told a lie?"
She goes, "Oh, well, Jimmy tells white lies all the time."
And the reporter said, "Well, tell me, what do you mean?
What is a white lie?"
And Miss Lillian said, "Remember when I said,
"'Welcome to Plains,' and 'How good it is to see you'?
That's a white lie."
Well, now, it's sometimes said that parents are never really satisfied with what their children accomplish...
I won't be satisfied until he gets in the White House.
You think he will?
Iknow he will.
And then what are you going to do?
I'm going to stay at the pond house and fish.
(train whistle blowing )
CARTER:
This election means a lot to our country.
NARRATOR:
Carter began the fall campaign against incumbent President Gerald Ford with a 15-point lead.
CARTER:
We've been disappointed... disillusioned.
We've been kept out of government.
We've been embarrassed.
Sometimes we've been ashamed...
NARRATOR:
He returned to the themes of honesty and trust that had defined his primary campaign.
Jimmy Carter will say anything, anywhere, to be president of the United States.
NARRATOR:
But as election day approached, he was pressured to take a stand on the issues.
He wanders, he wavers, he waffles and he wiggles.
He isn't the man...
LANCE:
He was a moderate to the moderates.
He was a conservative to the conservatives.
He was a liberal to the liberals.
And in fact he was all of those things.
We're going to have a fair government once again.
We're going a government that's open and not secret, once again.
MAN:
His standard line when asked about his foreign policy was that he wanted to provide a foreign policy as good as the American people.
Well, gee, that's great but what in the world does it mean?
You can depend on it.
You help me, I'll help you.
Thank you very much.
GLAD:
The gist of what he presented was that he would be a centrist Democrat who had liberal values in his heart, as well as the desire for frugality and thrift and efficiency in government.
And so he could appeal to people from all parts of the Democratic party.
But as Julian Bond said at one point,
"The problem with this is that his support was an inch deep and a mile wide."
NARRATOR:
Alarmed that support among liberal Democrats was eroding,
Carter's young staff made a bold move.
MAN:
We did thePlayboy interview to show that being a born-again Christian was not a threat to more secular Democrats and young people.
NARRATOR:
For five hours, Carter tried to explain his views on culture, politics and faith.
Toward the end of the interview, exasperated at not being understood, he said, "I've looked on a lot of women with lust.
I've committed adultery in my heart many times."
MAN (continues ):
If you read the interview, the "lust in your heart" line was to try to explain that he, too, was a sinner, that...
But the language was-- and I would see this all the time--
Carter used language that was germane to his world, to his... like we all do-- to our own cultural context.
Here's a guy who is so moral, but on the one hand he talks about he's lusted after women in his heart, and he talks about shacking up and he uses language that's going to really enrage
and turn off a lot of people.
BRINKLEY:
Do not underestimate what a crisis that interview and the "lust in my heart"
caused Carter.
It almost derailed the entire Carter campaign.
They were in havoc over it.
CADDELL:
In retrospect, it was kind of amusing.
It wasn't very funny at the time, trying to explain to people that Jimmy Carter was not some child molester, you know, I mean, or pervert.
ThePlayboy thing has been of very great concern to me.
I don't know how to deal with it exactly.
NARRATOR:
By the time Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford met in the first of two presidential debates,
Carter's lead had evaporated.
The momentum belonged to Ford.
Two weeks later, he blundered.
FORD:
There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.
Uh, I'm sorry, could I just follow...
Did I understand you to say, sir, that the Russians are not using Eastern Europe as their own sphere of influence...
MONDALE:
We knew that this was going to hurt, that a lot of people couldn't see how a president would say that.
It gave us about a week, as I recall, to pound away on this.
And you could just feel people moving on that question.
So what it did, I think, was rather than electing us, it stopped our slide.
(applause and cheering )
NARRATOR:
By election day, the polls showed a dead heat.
It was not until 3:00 a.m.
that the networks announced the winner-- by one of the closest margins in American history.
(cheering )
CADDELL:
I look back now, and I just...
I'm amazed.
Going from total anonymity to being president of the United States, in less than 12 months, is unprecedented in American history.
If it weren't for the country looking for something in '76,
Carter could never have gotten elected.
He'd never have been allowed out of the box.
He offered a biography of what we wanted to hear:
farmer, Main Street values, Plains.
It was the right message at the right time and it didn't happen by accident.
Carter created that message, knowing that that's what would win the day.
I came all the way through.
Took 22 months, and I didn't get...
choked up until I... (crowd chuckles )
(crowd applauds )
(crowd cheers and whistles )
CRONKITE:
This was not planned, it was not scheduled and whether this is Carter's surprise for his inaugural, by golly, Bob, how about that?
NARRATOR:
The morning of January 20, 1977,
Jimmy Carter surprised the nation.
CHIP CARTER:
I remember I was out there walking and you could hear Walter Cronkite over the loudspeaker saying, "The president is walking down the street!"
It was a major moment of the Carter presidency symbolically.
It was great theater.
DAN CARTER:
Here was this tremendous breath of fresh air.
He was going to bring something new to Washington, bring new people and new ideas.
CARTER:
Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair...
It was so different from what had come before.
People were looking for something that was simple, something that was pure, and it just struck a chord in the American people.
CARTER:
More is not necessarily better.
MAN:
Jimmy Carter was exactly what the American people always say they want:
above politics, determined to do the right thing regardless of political consequences, a simple person who doesn't lie, a modest man, not somebody with a lot of imperial pretenses.
That's what people say they want and that's what they got with Jimmy Carter.
NARRATOR:
The Carter team arrived in Washington full of confidence, ready to take on the Washington insiders they had run against.
CADDELL:
I felt like the advance wave of the German army arriving in Paris in 1940.
I mean, this is a democratic city, and they were terrified-- I mean, terrified.
You could feel it in the air.
They did not have a lot in common with the national political party.
They did not have a lot in common with the Congress.
They were a very close-knit band of brothers and they were intensely loyal to Jimmy Carter.
And they were pretty cocky guys as well.
There was clearly some degree of suspicion and maybe even a little bit of resentment that...
"Here come these folks riding in here
"that didn't really pay their dues.
"They're not us.
"They're not our kind of folks and all of a sudden they're in the White House,"
and "We'll show them that this town is tougher than they think."
WOMAN:
His top people had no experience in Washington.
And they were sort of contemptuous of Washington.
Well, it's one thing to sort of run against Washington, but you have to live there and you have to govern there and you have to work with the people who are there, and it really doesn't get you anywhere
to have this attitude if you want to get anything done.
You get things done by power.
You get power from having public support.
My argument was that in order to maintain power we would have to reinforce constantly the message of what we were doing.
Good evening.
Tomorrow will be two weeks since I became president...
NARRATOR:
On February 2,
Carter addressed the nation in a fireside chat on energy.
The country had been through an oil scare in 1973.
To head off a new crisis, Carter appealed directly to Americans to rally around a new program.
All of us must learn to waste less energy.
Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night, we can save half the current shortage of natural gas.
If we learn to live thriftily and remember the importance of helping our neighbors, then we can find ways to adjust.
NARRATOR:
Carter led by example.
He curtailed the use of limousines, canceled magazine subscriptions, unplugged television sets, and put the presidential yacht, Sequoia, on the auction block.
He turned off the air conditioners and it was so hot in the White House, people would come in there... (laughs )
It was unbelievable.
It would be a hundred above in there.
NARRATOR:
To save on staff overtime, all White House functions would end at midnight.
No hard liquor would be served.
HERTZBERG:
Jimmy Carter is a Low Church Protestant, where it's a sin not to have a hard wooden bench to sit on in church.
And he brought that simplicity to the White House.
MAN:
We were all invited down to the White House every other Tuesday.
We walked into the private dining room on the first floor off the East Room.
We looked at the table and there were these little fingertip cookies, and...
Tip O'Neill looked at me and he said, "What's this?"
I said, "I guess that's breakfast."
So the president walked in, you know, walked around the room and shook hands with everybody.
And O'Neill looked at the president, and he says,
"Mr. President, you know, wewon the election."
CARTER:
That's the last time you were here?
That's the last time I was in the Oval Office.
NARRATOR:
Carter presented his agenda to the speaker of the house, Tip O'Neill.
Energy was Carter's number-one priority, but it was competing with his long list of other legislation-- bills on hospital cost containment, urban policy, ethics in government.
You brought enough for four years' work.
I understand that.
NARRATOR:
There was nothing in the package to grease the wheels of government.
Some are of more priority than others.
NARRATOR:
When Carter struck from his budget 19 multimillion-dollar water projects that had been approved by President Ford, congressmen were furious.
DREW:
He was absolutely right to take it on-- these sort of boondoggles and unnecessary, really, pork-barrel things-- but he didn't know how to take it on.
You have to build political capital, you have to build alliances, you have to make deals.
LANCE:
Thequid pro quo was not in him.
If you came to him and said,
"Look, we can get so-and-so to vote for us,"
he would turn a deaf ear.
NARRATOR:
"He never understood how the system worked,"
Tip O'Neill would later complain.
"And although this was out of character for Jimmy Carter, he didn't want to learn about it either."
DAN CARTER:
If your job is to find the public good, to arrive at what the public good is and then to articulate it, and then you become the voice of the people.
And when you do that, it becomes very difficult to compromise.
ROSTENKOWSKI:
On one occasion when I was talking to President Carter
I said, "Mr. President,
"you know, I've had three presidents before you
"and I'll have several after you.
"I'm telling you, from the vantage point
"of what I see in the legislative process,
"you will be able to do and what you won't be able to do.
Now, you can accept that or not accept it."
But Carter's attitude was members of the House and Senate are bad guys.
FARRELL:
Carter put O'Neill and the others like him in the same category with the corrupt Georgia courthouse pols that he had been fighting for much of his life.
The same kind of back-scratching, featherbedding pol, worrying about the next election, worrying about their public opinion polls, coming in and not doing what was right.
BRINKLEY:
Often, he wouldn't return phone calls of leading senators.
There was a kind of an abrasive attitude he had towards them.
He never showed them the respect.
So they all eventually got bitter and turned on him.
DAN CARTER:
Even if he had had a personality transplant and he had spent three hours a night playing poker with Tip O'Neill,
I don't think that would have made the difference.
I mean, he was...
he was faced with an extraordinarily difficult set of circumstances, which in part sprang not only from the political situation, but from his... the...
the lack of a connection between his own views and those of his party.
NARRATOR:
"There will be no new programs implemented
"unless they are compatible
"with my goal of having a balanced budget by the end of my first term," he pledged.
But liberal Democrats, eager to resume the social agenda of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, would not back away.
MAN:
There had been an eight-year period when there had been no Democratic President.
There were a lot of pent-up and legitimate desires by constituency groups for more investment in a whole range of programs.
Although he sympathized with much of it, all of his instincts were to cut budgets, reduce the deficit dramatically.
But he was always under pressure from the Left to have more spending.
NARRATOR:
At a breakfast meeting,
Carter berated the congressional Democratic leadership for adding $61 billion in new programs to his budget.
"The Democratic Party needs to remove the stigma of unjustified spending," he said.
"Mr. President," Tip O'Neill reminded Carter,
"the Democrats are the champions of the poor and the indigent."
BOURNE:
Carter thought that big social programs and large amounts of federal spending would bankrupt the country.
He could see, I think, very clearly, the way the world was going, and he knew that old era had to be phased out.
Carter, looking back, was being very long-sighted in saying, you know,
We just don't have an open-ended,
"never-ending amount of money to spend.
We have to get things in balance."
NARRATOR:
Carter's commitment to fiscal restraint appealed to a growing number of Americans.
"He brings to the office a refreshing habit of plain words and simple manners,"
wroteNewsweek.
"A mind and discipline of tempered steel and an insatiable appetite for work."
Jimmy Carter had entered the presidency with only 51% of the vote.
By June, he enjoyed an approval rating of over 70%.
Then came an event that rocked the foundation of the Carter presidency.
It was called the Lance Affair.
In July 1977,
Carter's budget director, Bert Lance, was accused of financial improprieties at his bank in Calhoun, Georgia.
A federal investigation cleared Lance of all illegal activity, but concluded he had engaged in "unsafe and unsound banking practices."
CARTER:
Bert Lance is a man of competence and a man of integrity, and that his services...
NARRATOR:
Believing the affair was behind him, Carter stood by his friend.
Bert Lance enjoys my complete confidence and support.
I'm proud to have him as part of my administration.
NARRATOR:
Carter had miscalculated.
To the press, the issue was ethics, not the law.
Sensing a scandal, they went on the attack.
POWELL:
There were a lot of journalists who very much wanted to prove that they could be as tough on a Democratic president as they had been on...
on a Richard Nixon.
There was a... a real desire to make sure that it was clear that they were going to pursue this every bit as aggressively.
One of the things people like to go after more than anything else is what they perceive as hypocrisy.
So that you're judged by the standards that you set for yourself.
And certainly,
Carter's talking about, "I'll never tell you a lie,"
and emphasizing honesty, provides an easy opportunity.
NARRATOR:
Carter's inner circle urged him to get rid of Lance.
But he was torn between loyalty to his friend and his own reputation.
For weeks, he allowed the Lance Affair to fester.
REPORTER:
Do you feel you were drummed out?
LANCE:
My statement speaks for itself.
I have no comment about being drummed out.
I said in my statement that I had to analyze and question what...
LANCE:
The day that I resigned, I came home, and I was spent.
I lay down on the bed crying about the situation, just from the standpoint of just having run out of any adrenaline or emotion or anything else, and so we had all that horde of media out on the front yard
that had been there constantly.
I guess it was a suicide watch.
REPORTER:
Any comment at all?
DREW:
Looking back, it wasn't that big a deal.
But what it did do at the time... was give the first blow to the image that Carter was trying to project that his was a squeaky-clean administration.
Whether my own credibility has been damaged, I can't say.
I would guess to some degree.
An unpleasant situation like this...
NARRATOR:
Carter's approval rating plunged 25 points.
POWELL:
It would have been better for the president if we had brought that to an end sooner.
It threw us off our stride.
It made it harder for us to talk about other things and sort of played into questions about whether we could lead and run the country.
CADDELL:
Until that moment, we had been driving the agenda.
Everyone danced to our tune.
After that, we danced to everybody else's tune.
And that hurt us with the public, because now Jimmy Carter is not in charge.
NARRATOR:
Only nine months in office,
Jimmy Carter was a wounded leader... struggling to regain the confidence of the American people.
He would succeed where others had failed... and face challenges no one could have imagined.
(crowd angrily shouting chant )
From the peanut fields of Georgia all the way to the White House, Jimmy Carter had accomplished one of the greatest triumphs in American political history.
GLAD:
He'd pulled off a miracle.
In the fall of 1975, he was barely visible as a candidate, six months later he has the Democratic presidential nomination;
now, that is a miracle.
BRINKLEY:
He offered a biography of what we wanted to hear-- farmer...
Main-Street values...
Plains.
It was the right message at the right time.
CARTER:
I'll never tell a lie...
NARRATOR:
He had promised the nation a new beginning... to heal the wounds of Watergate and Vietnam.
A government as good and decent and compassionate as the American people.
HERTZBERG:
What he had was a moral ideology.
And the issues where he proved successful-- the Panama Canal treaties, the human rights crusade, peace in the Middle East,-- those were issues where his moral ideology guided him.
The one argument that I would find would ruin a person's case is when he'd say, "This is good for you politically."
He didn't want to hear that.
He wanted to know what's right.
NARRATOR:
But the man who would pledge to restore honesty and trust to government, would find his own integrity attacked when his friend and budget chief, Bert Lance, was accused of financial improprieties.
CADDELL:
Until that moment, we had been driving the agenda;
everyone danced to our tune.
After that, we danced to everbody else's tune.
And that hurt us in the public, because now Jimmy Carter is not in charge.
DREW:
He's a very, very smart man and very well intentioned.
But feel, feel is very, very important in politics-- especially in a president-- and Carter just didn't have very much of it.
NARRATOR:
Only nine months in office,
Jimmy Carter was a president in trouble-- the economy spinning out of control, a growing energy crisis, his agenda stalled in Congress-- but Carter's greatest test was yet to come, half a world away in Iran,
when 53 Americans were taken hostage by Muslim fundamentalists.
CARTER:
The United States of America will not yield to international terrorism...
MAN:
The whole world saw these people stomping on images of Carter, burning American flags and the most rancid sort of disrespect and hatred of the United States, um, on television around the world all the time.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
No one can know how much pressure there was on Jimmy.
I would go, "Why don't you do something?"
Then he said, "What would you want me to do?"
I said, "Mine the harbors."
He said, "Okay, suppose I mine the harbors,
"and they decide to take one hostage out every day and kill him, what am I going to do then?"
POWELL:
To react in a way that was strong and powerful would have set us off down a road that no man could say where it might lead.
DREW:
Fairly or not, it came to symbolize the question of whether Carter was a leader, whether he was competent, whether he was strong.

NARRATOR:
On May 22, 1977, before the graduating class at the University of Notre Dame,
President Jimmy Carter unveiled a new foreign policy for the United States.
Being confident of our own future, we are now free of that inordinate fear of communism.
NARRATOR:
Carter had come to office with no experience in foreign affairs, but determined to make his mark.
In his first year alone, he met more than 40 heads of state, resumed talks on diplomatic relations with China and with the Soviet Union on arms control.
He launched a new peace process in the Middle East and signed a new Canal Treaty with Panama, transferring, after 75 years, ownership of the Canal to the Panamanians.
But it was a principle straight from his heart that would redefine America's role in the world.
We have reaffirmed America's commitment to human rights as a fundamental tenet of our foreign policy.
MAN:
That was his greatest speech, standing up for our own values, and expecting then that the world would appreciate that we would be-- he didn't used this phrase, but its an old phrase in American history--
like the beacon on the hill, the beacon of freedom and liberty and democracy.
GLAD:
He will be remembered for putting on the agenda hereafter the whole issue of human rights.
We now assume that the goal of a State is not only to protect its national security interests.
It has an obligation to try to deal with human suffering where it has the ability to do that.
I feel very deeply that when people are put in prison without trials and tortured and deprived of basic human rights that the president of the United States ought to have a right to express displeasure and to do something about it.
MONDALE:
His idea is that every child is a child of God and, based on his faith, entitled to the stature and respect and the rights of what that means.
NARRATOR:
Initially, human rights was applied aggressively to friend and foe.
Carter asked Congress to withhold military and economic assistance from Latin American dictators in Chile, Argentina, Nicaragua, and decried their human rights violations.
"Cold warriors" complained
Carter was undermining American allies, paving the way for Soviet-backed guerrilla movements to seize power.
But they applauded when, in an open letter to Soviet physicist Andrey Sakharov,
Carter promised to seek the release of political prisoners held in Soviet jails.
BRINKLEY:
The human rights campaign was charging the Soviet Union with abuse of its own citizens, and they did not like that at all.
And we now know-- now that the Cold War archives are open, and from looking at Havel in Czechoslovakia or Lech Walesa in Poland-- that it was the Carter's human rights policy that gave heart to the underground resistance movement.
NARRATOR:
But the biggest challenge to Carter's human rights policy would come in the Middle East.
Iran, because of the great leadership of the Shah, is an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas in the world.
NARRATOR:
Carter was aware of the brutality of Iran's secret police and of 2,500 political prisoners held in Iran's jails.
But the Shah, installed to the throne in a US-backed coup in 1953, had long been a trusted ally.
New Years' Eve 1977, in Teheran,
Carter reaffirmed America's support.
SMITH:
Strategic considerations trumped human rights in Iran, because the perception of the United States was, first, that Iran was a secure source of oil-- and it certainly was an important source of oil-- that it had one of the most powerful military establishments
in the world-- which was nonsense, but the Shah was saying he was going to have the second most powerful navy.
Iran, of course, bordered on the Soviet Union.
There are circumstances where you have to have a situational morality.
You cannot go in with the notion this is an absolute value, we're going to push it all the time.
I would like to offer a toast at this time... to the great leaders of Iran, the Shah and the Shahbanou, and to the people of Iran and to the world peace that we hope together we can help to bring.
NARRATOR:
One week after Carter's visit, anti-Shah demonstrations broke out.
When Iranian secret police fired on the demonstrators and killed several students, religious leaders called the Shah's government anti-Islamic.
DREW:
Iran was a very complicated situation.
And the Shah was very useful to us.
At the same time, something else was going on, something very powerful was going on in Iran.
And as I recall, we kind of missed it.
We knew there was some resentment and we knew somewhat of the history of the country, but we were not conscious, nor were we informed of the intensity of the feelings.
NARRATOR:
Since the days of Plains and peanuts, the marriage of Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter had blossomed into a full partnership.
Some time before Carter became president he realized what a valuable adviser to him Rosalynn was.
She was a major player in the campaigns and she did have a good rapport with the people.
She, of course, was ambitious in her own right.
She wanted to be more than a fashion plate and somebody who gave teas.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
The first year Jimmy was in office, I became so frustrated.
Every night Jimmy would get off the elevator at the White House and I would say, "Why did you do this?"
And one day he finally said,
"Why don't you come to cabinet meetings?
And then you'll know why we do these things."
So I started going-- it was always on my calendar-- and I'd just listen.
I didn't participate, but I listened.
And then I knew why the decisions were made.
NARRATOR:
The first child to live in the White House since the Kennedy years, nine-year-old Amy had the run of the place.
She roller-skated down the marble hallways, played in a tree house her father built for her, even got a new dog, named Grits.
BRINKLEY:
She was the apple of her father's eye.
President Carter hadn't spent a lot of time with his three sons when they were growing up, so he tried to put a lot of attention and energy into Amy.
NARRATOR:
In keeping with Carter's populist image,
Amy was sent to public school.
The media made much of the fact that her best friend was the daughter of the cook at the Chilean embassy.
She is such a shy, intelligent girl.
It was very hard, always having that media glare.
And I think after the White House she's tried her best to stay out of the limelight.
NARRATOR:
One Carter did not shy away from the glare of the media.
Back in Plains,
Billy capitalized on his brother's fame.
He made money on the talk show circuit and marketed his own brand of beer.
The president tolerated his brother's antics.
"He enjoyed the popularity," he wrote,
"and presented the other side of the Carter family, full of fun and laughter."
NARRATOR:
In 1978, the first signs of a gathering economic storm were becoming visible.
The stock market was at its lowest point in three years, the trade deficit growing, unemployment on the rise.
CARTER:
The most serious problem that our nation has is inflation, and it's getting worse.
It's absolutely imperative that Americans commit themselves-- all of us-- to a common sacrifice to control this rapid increase in prices.
Carter inherited a no-win economic situation.
I see him as the last presidential victim of the war in Vietnam.
Every war this country has fought... once it is over, the economy has to readjust to a peacetime economy.
I call on the private sector...
GODBOLD:
And what always happens is runaway inflation.
NARRATOR:
Carter implored labor and business leaders to keep wages and prices down, and pressured Congress to cut back spending.
CARTER:
I believe the American people will understand.
NARRATOR:
But inflation kept rising, his words falling on deaf ears.
MAN:
He has this enormous determination to go after and do what he thinks ought to be done.
The capacity to explain, persuade, inspire, mobilize, energize the whole country...
I do not have all the answers-- nobody does.
LANEY:
Uh, that was far more tenuous and uncertain.
CARTER:
But I want to let you know that fighting inflation will be a central...
LANEY:
He thought people would just follow, but that didn't happen.
CARTER:
And I want to arouse our nation to join me in this effort.
NARRATOR:
There were growing doubts about Carter's leadership.
The President, most Americans believed, was too mired in details, was ineffective with Congress, had attempted too much and delivered too little.
EIZENSTAT:
This is a classic case where first impressions often sets in with people and the first impressions of that first year were too many things, lack of priorities, a lack of accomplishment.
The fact is, we actually had a good legislative record, but we've thrown so much up, that in comparison, the accomplishments seem to pail.
ROSALYNN:
I would sometimes say,
"Why don't we do this in your second term?"
and he would say, "What if I don't have a second term?"
And I think he felt that way the whole time-- that if something needed to be done, it needed to be done.
NARRATOR:
With an approval rating of only 33%,
Time Magazine concluded,
"He has the potential for growing in the office, but he does not have a great deal of time left."
NARRATOR:
Nestled in the mountains of Maryland,
Camp David was Jimmy Carter's refuge.
It was the place he and Rosalynn repaired to on weekends to get away from the pressures of Washington.
In September 1978,
Jimmy Carter would enshrine Camp David, and himself, in history.
MONDALE:
He had spent a lot of time studying the Middle East.
He felt very deeply that we should try to find peace over there, and boy, he really bet his presidency on that.
GLAD:
He was already very low in the polls-- he had practically nowhere to go but up-- but he still could possibly win a second term, and if he failed, that would... that would certainly write him off.
NARRATOR:
Since the creation of the state of Israel, every attempt to bring peace to the Middle East had failed.
Refugees, land disputes, terrorism plagued the region.
Four wars, the last in 1973, had left a bitter legacy of hate and mistrust.
NARRATOR:
Everyone urged Carter to stay away from what seemed an intractable situation, but he would not be deterred.
"I slowly became hardened, and as stubborn as at any other time I can remember," he wrote.
The Middle East, for years, had been, and was then, the place where you thought,
"If we're going to end up blowing up the world,
"that's where it will start.
"If there's going to be a nuclear confrontation
"between the superpowers it's going to come out of the Middle East,"
so finding... you know, finding a way to tamp that down was, to him, extremely important.
NARRATOR:
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat took the first step toward peace in November 1977, when he became the first Arab leader to set foot on Israeli soil.
Carter seized the opportunity.
The following September, he welcomed President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David to negotiate a treaty that would lay the foundations for peace in the Middle East.
GLAD:
He brought all of his skills and all the best sides of himself to the whole operation, and all of the potential in Jimmy Carter was out there at Camp David.
It was a... really, an extraordinary time.
SMITH:
He had studied things so carefully.
He knew the population of every village in the West Bank and Israel.
It's hard to think of...
of a president in our history who had that much capacity to absorb and retain detail.
GLAD:
He made a mistake at the very beginning.
He thought, and told his aides,
"You know, we're just going to bring together Begin and Sadat,
"and they'll talk and they'll get to know each other and they'll understand each other."
Well, he got them there, and it turned out, after the first three meetings, they were practically never talking to each other and things were going downhill very fast.
NARRATOR:
"It was mean," Carter later recalled.
"They were brutal with each other.
Face-to-face discussions became an impossibility."
On day three-- the expected deadline for an agreement--
Carter had accomplished nothing.
"There must be a way," he kept saying, "there must be a way."
That night at dinner, alone with Rosalynn, he arrived at a solution.
If the two men could not talk to one another, they would have to talk through him.
He decided that essentially the Americans would draft the proposal and put the proposal on the table.
You wouldn't have an Egyptian and an Israeli proposal.
You would have an American proposal.
NARRATOR:
"I must admit that I capitalized on the situation,"
Carter later wrote.
"It greatly magnified my own influence."
Carter devoted himself to drafting an agreement.
With more than 50 issues to be resolved, the work was painstaking.
He was remarkably tenacious, persistent, persuasive, tough-minded, tough both with Sadat on some occasions, and with Begin on other occasions.
BRINKLEY:
That people trusted him as an honest broker came to play in a very magical and important way.
He is seen as somebody who is not a cheat or a liar.
He is somebody who puts his money where his mouth is.
NARRATOR:
"My world became the negotiating rooms,
"the study where I pored over my notes and maps of the Middle East," he recalled.
"Between sessions, I craved intense exercise and lonely places where I could think, and sometimes pray."
ROSALYNN:
He had things scheduled after the first week, and I was going into Washington to do some of the things he was supposed to do.
And when I would leave to go in, they would say,
"Don't smile, because everybody will think it will be all right.
Don't look grim because they'll think it's failing."
That was hard.
It was from the depths to the heights all the time at Camp David.
One minute you would think it was going to pass and everything was so exciting, and then... and another... another time it would be just hopeless.
POWELL:
It always seemed to me that the odds were against success;
it always seemed like a long shot, and so I was...
I spent a good bit of my time thinking about, How are we going to deal with this thing if it collapses?
NARRATOR:
Shuttling back and forth between Sadat and Begin,
Carter began to put together an agreement... a framework for negotiations in the Middle East, which would address the fate of the Palestinians and the future of Gaza and the West Bank... and a separate peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Israel would return the Sinai territories occupied since the 1967 war.
Egypt would recognize the right of Israel to live in peace.
On September 14, day ten, Carter turned to the issue he knew could derail any progress made so far-- the dismantling of Israeli settlements in the Sinai.
BOURNE:
Carter was unable to get Begin to make any concessions that would really have locked up an agreement, to the point where Sadat just got fed up and said, "Well, I'm going home," you know.
"I'm just not going to wait any... be here any longer,"
and... and literally sort of had his coat on and was out the door.
NARRATOR:
Carter begged Sadat to stay, appealing to their friendship and mutual trust, and reminding him of Egypt's good relations with the United States.
Sadat decided to remain at Camp David.
Saturday, September 16, Brzezinski wrote in his diary:
"The President is driving himself mercilessly.
"He has single-handedly written the proposed document for the settlements on the Sinai."
Carter presented the formula to Begin.
At first he called the demands on Israel
"excessive," "political suicide."
But in the end he relented, agreeing to submit the question of the Jewish settlements to the Israeli parliament.
Jimmy Carter saw a picture of the three major participants on his desk, and he told his secretary to find out the names of Begin's grandchildren and so then he wrote little notes, putting in the names of all the grandchildren.
He went over to Begin and said,
"You know, this is not just for us.
This is for our grandchildren, and let me give this to you."
And Begin was profoundly moved by this.
NARRATOR:
The Camp David Accords were hailed as a monumental triumph of diplomacy.
(applause )
NARRATOR:
"With his brilliant success and inspired leadership,
"Carter has taken a first, big step toward realizing the promise of his presidency,"
was the verdict of the press.
These negotiations provide that Israel may live in peace within secure and recognized borders, and this great aspiration of Israel has been certified, without constraint, with the greatest degree of enthusiasm, by President Sadat, the leader
of one of the greatest nations on earth.
(warm applause )
BRINKLEY:
There will never be a history in the Middle East written without Jimmy Carter's name in the index.
A hundred years from now, 200 years from now, people will be talking about the Camp David process that began in those Maryland mountains.
BOURNE:
Camp David was the plum of his administration.
This was the crowning glory, and it enshrined him in history.
CARTER:
To these two friends of mine, the words of Jesus:
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be the children of God."
(sustained applause )
NARRATOR:
Sadat and Begin were awarded the Nobel Prize for their contribution to peace.
Camp David became the touchstone for all future negotiations on the Middle East.
Yet Carter's great success did nothing to improve his standing with the American people.
MONDALE:
There was something about how we had slipped in the eyes of the American people that prevented us from getting what should have been an enormous lift out of this incredible diplomatic feat.
We thought, "Boy, this shows we can get things done.
It does bring peace in a crucial area."
And there was no movement at all.
It was very dispiriting.
WOMAN:
♪ Say it's only a paper moon... ♪
NARRATOR:
At home, President Carter's leadership was in question.
On the world stage, he kept piling up accomplishments.
In January 1979, he received Chinese Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping in Washington to celebrate the establishment of formal relations between the United States and China.
WOMAN:
♪ If you believe in me...
NARRATOR:
In June, he met Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev in Vienna, to sign the SALT II arms control agreement.
From there, it was on to Tokyo for a major economic summit.
CADDELL:
The country is having this terrible domestic problem and the president is somewhere out on the other side of the world, and not for a couple of days-- for weeks.
And I remember getting on the phone and saying,
"You people got to come home now."
NARRATOR:
In one year, the American economy had spun out of control.
Gasoline prices had more than doubled, mortgage rates pushed 20%.
Unemployment kept on rising.
LANCE:
There were just so many forces at work.
When inflation becomes rampant, interest rates are high and the business cycle is turning against you, it becomes almost impossible.
NARRATOR:
Of all the problems facing the nation, most Americans now agreed inflation was the most urgent.
In the Summer of '79, fueled by rising oil prices, it surged to 14%.
MAN:
Inflation makes you doubt the future.
When you have inflation, you don't see as much building going on, you don't see as much investment going on, you don't see as much hiring going on.
People weren't seeing their savings growing, and as a matter of fact, people were terrified that inflation would impoverish them in their old age.
NARRATOR:
Carter acted decisively.
To reduce the budget deficit and bring inflation under control he cut into social programs.
"New realities," explained the White House,
"must temper our nation's commitment to the poor."
BOURNE:
It stirred up a hornet's nest of opposition from the Ted Kennedy people, from the traditional F.D.R. coalition.
They were very, very angry.
NARRATOR:
African-American leaders felt betrayed and vowed to wage an all-out fight on what they called
"Carter's immoral, unjust and inequitable budget cuts."
WILKINS:
The leader who most encapsulated the goals that I wanted was Martin King, at the end of his life, saying to the country,
"We have to do something about poor Americans.
"We're the richest country on the face of the earth, and we've got to do something."
Every time I vote for a Democrat, I want that Democrat to have Martin's spirit about poverty in his soul.
Jimmy Carter ran away from that.
(warning siren wails )
NARRATOR:
Across America, frustration was reaching a breaking point.
In Levittown, Pennsylvania, truckers barricaded expressways to protest high fuel prices, setting off riots which left 100 injured and led to more than 170 arrests.
CADDELL:
I thought in '79, we were really headed down the tubes.
I now thought we were in deep, deep trouble, and I thought the president was becoming irrelevant.
NARRATOR:
Polls showed Carter falling behind Ted Kennedy as the preferred candidate among Democratic voters, and even losing trial heats to the likely Republican nominee, Ronald Reagan.
WOMAN:
I don't think he has control of the situation;
I think he's a very religious man, a very nice man but I just don't think he's capable of the job.
A lot of people think he's shaky, you know, and I'm one of them.
I think he's kind of shaky.
I think he's a real floundering leader.
I don't see him as a leader and I don't look to him for leadership.
NARRATOR:
President Carter's approval rating was 25%-- lower than President Richard Nixon's at the time of Watergate.
"It all seems to be falling down around me in the White House,"
he told a friend.
"I don't know what to do."
MONDALE:
I think he was losing some of that essential nerve that he has in such abundance, but just for a brief moment there.
It was really, uh...
I was heartsick, and I felt so sorry for him.
NARRATOR:
Carter groped for a way to reassert his leadership.
One advisor suggested that he give a major speech on energy, and put the full blame of the economic crisis on the high price of Middle East oil.
EIZENSTAT:
When we drew the outlines up, he was really quite disgusted.
This is just more of the same.
It doesn't address the basic problems.
People will see this as pabulum.
We need something more.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
Jimmy had made several speeches on energy.
He was trying to impress upon people the fact that they needed to conserve and it just seemed to be going nowhere with the public.
And so he just said, "I'm not going to make the speech."
So he got on a conference call with his senior staff, and the way he put it, very pungently, was,
"I just don't want to bullshit the American people."
NARRATOR:
Carter retreated to Camp David.
For the next ten days, businessmen, labor leaders, governors, pop psychologists and clergy were called to the mountaintop to participate in one of the most extraordinary episodes of presidential soul searching in American history.
HERTZBERG:
Basically this was a kind of a self-psychoanalysis by Carter and the administration.
He sat up there and listened to the most scalding critiques of his presidency.
NARRATOR:
"They told me that I seemed bogged down in details,"
Carter wrote.
"That the public acknowledged my intelligence and integrity,
"but doubted my capacity to follow through with a strong enough thrust to succeed."
Within Carter's own staff a fierce debate raged over what had gone wrong and what President Carter should say to the American people.
Carter's pollster argued the president should address a subject deeper than energy or the economy;
that there was a crisis of the American spirit.
CADDELL:
For the first time, we actually got numbers where people no longer believed that the future of America was going to be as good as it was now.
Never in the history of American polling had that ever existed-- that Americans, ever if they believed it, ever evidenced, would say, "Oh, my children are going have it worse than I am.
"The country's going to get worse.
We've already had our heyday."
And that really shook me, because it was so anti...
so anti-American.
I made the point, and Mondale made the point, that if there was a problem with the American spirit, it was because of the underlying problems of inflation and energy, not because there was something wrong with the American people.
I argued that there were real problems in America that were not mysterious, that were not rooted in some kind of national psychosis or breakdown;
that there were real gas lines, there was real inflation, that people were worried in their real lives about keeping their jobs.
CADDELL:
The vice president of the United States was looking at me, basically accusing me of being insane.
So you had this real division and then Jimmy Carter ended it by saying-- and this moment, I'll never forget it-- he ends the thing, saying, "I just wanted to hear what you all said.
"I've decided.
I'm going to do everything that Pat said."
Good evening.
This is a special night for me.
NARRATOR:
On July 15, after a ten-day retreat,
Jimmy Carter descended from the mountains of Maryland to deliver the most controversial speech of his administration.
I want to speak to you first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation.
I want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to American democracy.
The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways.
It is a crisis of confidence.
It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will.
HERTZBERG:
The speech was more like a sermon than a political speech, and it had the themes of confession, redemption and sacrifice.
And he was bringing the American people into this spiritual process that he had been through, and presenting them with an opportunity for redemption as well as redeeming himself.
In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption.
Human identity is no longer defined by what onedoes, but by what oneowns.
FARRELL:
The speech unfairly was labeled the "malaise speech,"
because it talked about the fact that the country was in a difficult situation, which it was.
But Americans don't always want their public leaders to come to them and say,
"Hey, we're in a bunch of trouble."
When your leadership is demonstrably weaker than it should be you don't then point at the people and say,
"It's your problem."
If you want the people to move, you move them the way Roosevelt moved them, or you exhort them the way Kennedy or Johnson exhorted them.
You don't say, It's your fault.
BRINKLEY:
The op-ed pieces started spinning out saying there's nothing wrong with the American people.
We're a great people.
Maybe the problem's in the White House.
Maybe we need new leadership to guide us.
It boomeranged on him.
POWELL:
If you make a bold stroke like that, you do have to think about how do you follow it up.
What does day three and day four and day five look like?
How do you translate that into additional steps?
And we botched that.
NARRATOR:
To give the impression of a fresh start,
Carter asked his entire cabinet to submit their resignations.
Five were accepted.
FARRELL:
By firing the cabinet the way he did
Carter just telegraphed to the country that he wasn't up for the job.
It was a sign of panic.
It looked like this was a president who was thrashing about, looking for other people to blame.
NARRATOR:
Carter's approval rating dropped even lower.
"After all the Camp David meetings,
"the dramatic speech on July 15
"and the cabinet firings, he is back where he began," one analyst wrote,
"a chief executive rejected by his ultimate constituency-- the American people."
That fall, the liberal wing of the Democratic Party finally broke with the President, throwing its support behind Ted Kennedy.
The senator from Massachusetts would wage a brutal campaign for the Democratic nomination.
For Jimmy Carter, nothing seemed to be going right.
He collapsed while running a ten-kilometer race.
It was taken as a sign of weakness.
He became the butt of jokes when a story broke that he'd been attacked by a giant rabbit while fishing in Georgia.
Even the Carter family, once thought fun and colorful, was becoming a liability.
Billy was investigated for accepting a bribe from the Libyan government.
Furious, Carter distanced himself from Billy.
"I have no control over my brother and he has no control over me," he said.
On November 4, 1979, it would all seem trivial.
A few days earlier, 3,500 Iranian students had marched toward the American Embassy in Teheran, threatening to overtake it.
(chanting )
NARRATOR:
The anti-Shah movement which had began in early 1978 had grown into a full-fledged Islamic Revolution.
The shah was driven into exile and the Ayatollah Khomeini became the leader of a new and mysterious Islamic Republic.
BRZEZINSKI:
I never had any illusions about Khomeini.
I didn't have much familiarity with fundamentalist Islam, but I knew he would be a menace.
SMITH:
If Carter had been more critical of the Shah, conceivably it would have been a little more difficult for the Ayatollah Khomeini to identify the United States as the great Satan, and to say everything that is wrong in Iran
is basically the fault of the United States.
Maybe the fact that the United States had been a significant player in Iran since 1945 was such that it was too late for Carter or anybody to change the deeply hostile nature of the Iranian revolution, but it might have made a difference.
NARRATOR:
In the first few months of the revolution,
Carter had worked to build a relationship with the Khomeini regime.
But the history of US-Iranian relations would soon catch up with him.
For months, the deposed Shah of Iran had wandered the Middle East, then Latin America.
Ill with cancer, he asked permission to come to the United States for medical treatment.
MONDALE:
There were several of us sitting around the table talking about whether the president should permit the reentry of the Shah.
We had people tell us that if we let the Shah in there could be a real negative repercussion in Iran.
But the Shah was sort of pathetically flying around the world.
And here's this great country saying,
"Well, we won't even let you come to one of our hospitals."
He went around the room, and a lot of the people said, "Let him in."
BRZEZINSKI:
I argued that he should be allowed in, because we treated him as an ally in good times, and I felt it was our responsibility to treat him as a former ally, but a friend, in bad times.
I felt American credibility was at stake.
MONDALE:
And he said, "And if then this revolution moves in a way to take our employees in our embassy hostage, then what will be your advice?"
And the room just fell dead.
(men shouting in Farsi )
NARRATOR:
The Shah arrived in the United States on October 22.
Two weeks later,
Iranian students seized the American Embassy.
53 Americans were to be held hostage until the United States returned the Shah to Iran.
Everyone awaited word from Khomeini.
Seeing an opportunity to consolidate his revolution, the Ayatollah gave his blessing, calling the US Embassy "a den of spies."
CARTER:
The United States of America will not yield to international terrorism or to blackmail.
CADDELL:
It was a defining event.
This is the entire United States government captured and held illegally under international law and being taunted every day.
WILKINS:
The whole world saw these images of these people burning American flags, stomping on images of Carter and the most rancid sort of disrespect and hatred of the United States, on television, around the world, all the time.
NARRATOR:
"I would lie awake at night,
"trying to think of steps I could take
"to gain the hostages' freedom, without sacrificing the honor and security of our nation,"
the president wrote.
Carter rejected all military options as too risky.
"The problem," he said,
"is that we could feel good for a few hours, until we found that they had killed our people."
BRINKLEY:
He was determined to bring every one of those men back alive.
You see the moralism of Carter, the Christianity affecting his foreign policy making, his belief in each human life having a great sanctity to it, his not wanting to have blood on his hands.
The successful statesmen have to balance risks, and sometimes...
sometimes a risk to a relatively limited number of lives, down the road saves many, many more lives.
POWELL:
To react in a way that was strong and powerful would have set us off down a road that no man could say where it might lead.
People have a hard time remembering that this was before the Cold War was over and... the possibility of a superpower confrontation in and about Iran had always been there, and now, under these circumstances, it was much higher.
NARRATOR:
The dangers of the Cold War were driven home when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan
Christmas Day, 1979.
Three years earlier at Notre Dame,
Carter had declared the United States
"free of that inordinate fear of communism."
But Soviet-American relations had soured.
Afghanistan was the final blow.
REPORTER:
Have you changed your perception of the Russians in the time that you've been here?
You started out, it seemed to a good many people, believing that if you expressed your goodwill and demonstrated it that they would reciprocate.
My opinion of the Russians has changed... most drastically in the last week than even the previous 2½ years before that.
It's only now dawning upon the world the, uh, magnitude of the action that the Soviets undertook in invading Afghanistan.
SMITH:
I think he had learned that moral affirmation by itself didn't necessarily get very far.
I think he felt that events had built up and conspired against him-- as they had-- and that the Soviet Union was, indeed, a real threat.
I've cut Soviet access to high-technology equipment and to agricultural products.
NARRATOR:
Carter leveled sanctions against the Soviets, boycotted the Summer Olympics in Moscow and withdrew his SALT II treaty from the Senate floor.
Encouraged by Carter's new toughness,
"Cold Warriors" who had organized into the Coalition for a Democratic Majority arranged a meeting at the White House.
There was a quite high-powered delegation of the leaders of CDM, who at that point included Jean Kirkpatrick, who was still a loyal Democrat.
People went into the meeting thinking, "He'd say there's a threat to world peace
"that requires an American response
"and I know you are the kind of people
"who will give me your support because you've been saying this about the Soviet Union all along."
Instead, Carter came in and sort of gave the group a lecture.
He said that he understood this group was interested in human rights and that was great, and he supported human rights.
We were all terribly disillusioned, and I think that almost all of our group, either publicly or in the privacy of the voting booth, decided we were going to vote for Reagan.
CRONKITE:
Good evening.
The 100th day of captivity for 50 Americans in Tehran...
REPORTER:
The 100th flag for 100 days of captivity
NARRATOR:
As spring 1980 approached, the hostages had grown into a national obsession.
Their memory kept alive by millions of yellow ribbons.
REPORTER:
...and the nation shares their ordeal.
NARRATOR:
No stone was left unturned trying to bring them home.
While Secretary of State Cyrus Vance dealt with Iranian government officials,
Hamilton Jordan met secretly with anyone who held out hope.
(voices murmuring )
"Our lives became a seesaw of emotions as scheme after scheme fell apart," Rosalynn later recalled.
"Every time we saw the hostages on television, I counted them."
ROSALYNN CARTER:
No one can know how much pressure there was on Jimmy to do something about that.
And I would go, like,
"Why don't you do something?"
He said, "What would you want me to do?"
I said, "Mine the harbors."
He said, "Okay, suppose I mine the harbors,
"and they decide to take one hostage out every day and kill him, what am I going to do then?"
(voices murmuring )
DREW:
Fairly or not, it came to symbolize the question of whether Carter was a leader, whether he was competent, whether he was strong.
NARRATOR:
By April, pressure was growing intense and the situation increasingly hopeless.
"We could no longer afford to depend on diplomacy,"
Carter was forced to conclude.
"I knew from an intelligence report
"that there was little prospect of the hostages' release
"for the next five or six months.
I decided to act."
It was called "Desert I."
It required six C-130 transport planes, a 90-man rescue team, two C-141 Starlifters, eight helicopters and nearly impossible logistics.
GLAD:
It was a highly risky operation.
The CIA even talked about the number of people-- including the hostages-- who might be killed;
but it was doing something.
NARRATOR:
South of Tehran, in the Iranian desert, the rescue mission turned into a disaster.
Two helicopters failed, another crashed into a C-130 in a sandstorm.
Eight men died in Desert 1, three more were severely burned.
CARTER:
It was my decision to attempt the rescue operation.
It was my decision to cancel it when problems developed.
The responsibility is fully my own.
POWELL:
I sort of thought at the time,
"Well, people will give the president credit for trying."
But I also realized that now the chances of being able to get those people out anytime in the near future was very, very slim, and that from a political standpoint, that was going to be a heavy burden to bear.
NARRATOR:
In August 1980, President Carter survived the challenge from Senator Edward Kennedy for the Democratic nomination.
The campaign had been bitter and divisive, but in the end, Kennedy had seemed too liberal and too tainted by scandal.
(cheering )
EIZENSTAT:
The attack from the left was extremely debilitating and the fact that we had a divided party going into the general election in 1980 against Ronald Reagan was an additional albatross beyond the hostage crisis, and beyond inflation.
REAGAN:
Jimmy Carter's administration tells us that the descendants of those who sacrificed to start again in this land of freedom may have to abandon the dream that drew their ancestors to a new life in a new land.
NARRATOR:
Republican candidate Ronald Reagan launched his campaign on Labor Day, with a broadside attack delivered before an audience of working-class Americans.
...record is a litany of despair, of broken promises, of sacred trusts abandoned and forgotten.
WILKINS:
Reagan was a very formidable fellow.
The combination of his beliefs-- which were not numerous, but they were clear-- um, and his acting skills, really made people sit up and say,
"This is... this guy means and believes what he's saying."
NARRATOR:
Carter trailed Reagan by more than 20 points.
With the Soviets in Afghanistan, the hostages in Iran and the economy in shambles, he was vulnerable.
LANCE:
We were still going through tough economic circumstances:
People were hurting, interest rates were higher, unemployment was higher, inflation was greater.
ANNOUNCER:
When you come right down to it, what kind of a person should occupy the Oval Office?
NARRATOR:
Unable to run on his record, Carter went on the attack portraying Reagan as trigger-happy cowboy with his finger on the nuclear button.
ANNOUNCER:
...and a destroyer to Ecuador to deal with a fishing controversy?
CADDELL:
We didn't have any cards to play because there wasn't any cards to play.
We were now trapped by events, trapped by a government that couldn't come up with any ideas, and basically, we were frustrating the hell out of people.
But they still trusted Jimmy Carter not to blow the world up, and that was our only hope.
NARRATOR:
On October 28, 100 million viewers, the largest audience ever to watch a presidential debate, tuned in.
The candidates were running neck and neck.
...then the insurance would help pay for it.
These are the kind of elements of a national health insurance important to the American people.
Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.
MODERATOR:
Governor.
There you go again.
When I opposed Medicare...
CADDELL:
He had won it in the first half-hour, by not being crazy.
What had happened was you could see the shift in the beginning of the debate, over 90 minutes was a sense of "he's not dangerous."
And that's all he had to do.
ANNOUNCER:
Today, the vigil of the hostages lengthens to one whole year.
NARRATOR:
The Monday before election day played like a nightmare for Jimmy Carter.
ANNOUNCER 2:
Today, the Majlis spelled out conditions for release of the American hostages now ending their first year in captivity, and the four conditions are the same as those set down...
POWELL:
A good portion of that weekend leading up to it and all day Monday,
Americans were literally having their nose rubbed in this embarrassing, irritating, humiliating situation.
NARRATOR:
Carter campaigned all day and into the night in Mississippi, Oregon, Washington.
He arrived in Seattle at 3:00 a.m.-- the last rally, the last speech.
POWELL:
I had stayed on the plane to finish up something.
Before I could get off, the phone rang.
And it was Hamilton Jordan and Pat Caddell back in Washington.
They had seen the tracking polls from that day, and they said, "It's basically over."
The people must decide this election.
For your sake and for the sake of your children, vote.
Vote, for yourselves.
Tomorrow, vote for yourselves.
Vote Democratic, help us.
God be with you.
POWELL:
I went in to hear his speech, thinking that I was the only person there who know that, basically, the election was over and that we had, that we had lost.
NARRATOR:
It was a landslide.
Carter won only six states.
For the first time in 28 years, the Democratic Party lost control of the Senate.
On the last day of his presidency,
Jimmy Carter stayed up through the night.
A deal with Iran had been reached.
The release of the hostages was imminent.
A crew from ABC News stood by to record the historic moment.
You're not sending that film anymore.
MONDALE:
He wanted to get these hostages home on his watch.
And this was not about getting reelected anymore.
This was about getting this done because he felt so deeply about it.
We were in the Oval Office around, maybe, 2:00 in the morning.
And nothing happening.
Dead silence.
But we got to the time where it was 9:00 in the morning.
We had to be at the inaugural.
The new president was coming in at 11:00.
And finally we all started running off.
And we still had one officer back there with a phone, the hot line, in case there was any news.
MAN:
Here they are now.
WOMAN:
Is there any word about the hostages?
Have they taken off?
MONDALE:
And he was in contact with Carter all the way up the inaugural route and on the platform.
So if there were anything that was positive or negative, he'd hear about it.
MAN:
♪ And the home of the...
MONDALE:
And of course, the story was that Khomeini released them the minute after Reagan was president.
(man finishes anthem )
NARRATOR:
January 20, 1981.
3,000 people gathered at the old train depot in Plains to welcome the Carters home.
POPE:
There was a sea of umbrellas, out there in the public, standing in the cold and the rain, waiting for him.
And it was a bittersweet day.
CHIP CARTER:
I think they reacted just like anybody else would that'd just been rejected by 200 million people.
It was one of the toughest times they've ever been through, I think.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
He really was better than I was when we came home, because I was so depressed about it that he was always trying to prop me up.
NARRATOR:
The Carters faced trying times.
Not only had their dreams been shattered, but the business they had spent a lifetime to build was more than a million dollars in debt.
POPE:
There were some hard days that followed.
They were withdrawn.
They just wanted to go home and rest and make things better.
And they needed a healing time.
NARRATOR:
Carter, only 56, was already labeled "a has-been,"
"a shooting star with not even a tail left to fizzle."
HERTZBERG:
The things that they had once loved about him, his piety and his simplicity and his kind of moral goodness, they now despised as weakness and, and moral superiority.
They just couldn't stand him.
LANEY:
It wasn't just that he was unpopular.
People avoided him.
This is hard to say and hard to believe today.
People didn't want to associate with him.
NARRATOR:
"It seemed astounding," Rosalynn observed,
"that after years of important events and decisions,
"the most important thing could be
"whether the brick walk we were building
"from our house to the street was crooked or straight."
CHIP CARTER:
Dad had a woodworking shop, and spent quite a lot of hours out there, working with a piece of lumber.
He can make a piece of lumber sing.
And a lot of it's just because of the meticulous care that he puts into everything he's done.
DAN CARTER:
If there was ever an individual who the maxim of, "An idle mind is the devil's workshop,"
Carter would perfectly exemplify that.
He's one of these people who simply never rests, and never has, I think.
So the question...
the question was not whether he was going to do something after he left the White House;
The question was what was he going to do.
NARRATOR:
The Carters settled in to write their memoirs and to make plans to build a presidential library.
But Carter had little enthusiasm for building what he called "a monument to myself."
ROSALYNN CARTER:
One night, I woke up, and Jimmy was sitting straight up in the bed.
This is after we'd been home about a year.
And I said, "What's the matter?"
I thought he was sick, because he always sleeps all night, even in the White House.
He can turn things off and go to sleep.
And he said, "I know what we can do at the library.
We can have a place to resolve conflicts."
And so that was the germ of the idea for what became The Carter Center.
NARRATOR:
Inspired by his success in the Camp David Accords,
Carter envisioned a place where he could host world leaders and mediate civil wars and political disputes.
At a cost of $28 million,
The Carter Center would span 35 acres, include an arboretum, a lake, and room enough for a staff of more then 100.
LANEY:
When he set up The Carter Center, he shared with me his vision, and I thought, "Oh, no, that..."
You know, "That's so grandiose."
I was...
Frankly, I was embarrassed for him.
He was at the nadir of popularity.
YOUNG:
Jimmy Carter was told that it would be impossible for him to get into the Naval Academy.
He was told that it would be impossible for him to get elected governor.
And when he announced for the presidency, even theAtlanta Constitution had a headline saying,
"Jimmy is running for what?"
So all of his life, he had done the impossible.
And this was just another challenge.
MAN:
Now lift it up and I'll screw it down.
NARRATOR:
Carter's political resurrection began unexpectedly with a quiet act.
Just a few miles from Plains, building houses for the poor through an organization called Habitat for Humanity.
BRINKLEY:
Carter became surprised at the success of Habitat.
He loves to build, he's a carpenter as his hobby, so it fit naturally to his own inclination.
And then he started getting great press.
(people talking and applauding )
NARRATOR:
In the summer of 1984, when he and Rosalynn led a busload of Georgians to New York City to rebuild a tenement on the Lower East Side, it was front page news in theNew York Times.
BRINKLEY:
It was in stark contrast to kind of the so-called greed decades of the '80s to see somebody not looking to make big speaking fees, not looking to sit on corporate boards.
It's just something about an ex-president being so humble, in blue jeans, with a hammer, sleeping on cots and building houses for the poor.
It's an image seared on our imaginations.
YOUNG:
When you're there as a private citizen, and when you're there because of your faith, there's something nice and fresh and humble about that.
And it's a language people understand.
NARRATOR:
Four years after his humiliating defeat, the image of Jimmy Carter, the failed president, was giving way to Jimmy Carter, the committed Christian in the service of the poor.
REAGAN:
So it is that when we dedicate this center, Mr. President, we dedicate an institution that testifies, as does your life itself, to the goodness of God, and to the blessings He bestows upon those who do their best to walk with Him.
NARRATOR:
In 1986, at the inauguration of The Carter Center,
President Reagan expressed the growing respect many now felt for the man they had once rejected.
(applause )
NARRATOR:
Through The Carter Center,
Jimmy Carter would launch his new career as an elder statesman, monitoring elections throughout the world.
They were patently counterfeit.
They had nothing to do...
NARRATOR:
His prestige restored, he returned to the role that had given meaning to his presidency:
peacemaker.
LANEY:
Carter has a profound, almost innate commitment to peace.
It's in his bones.
He really believes Theodore Roosevelt's adage that one should walk softly and carry a big stick.
But don't be afraid to walk into the lion's den.
And he does that.
He's done it repeatedly.
NARRATOR:
In Haiti, Carter convinced military strongman Raoul Cédras to step down in favor of the democratically elected president,
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
BRINKLEY:
Carter believes that there's goodness in all people, and that even the biggest sinner, today's brutal dictator, can take Christ into their heart and be born again tomorrow.
They can be saved.
We are very glad to be back in Haiti.
(woman speaking French )
A country obviously dedicated to peace, human rights, and democracy.
BRINKLEY:
So even Cédras, who was considered a brutal thug by the US government,
Carter felt that he could appeal to his sense of what is right and what is wrong.
This caused Carter a lot of criticism, coddling dictators around the world.
(announcer speaking Spanish )
NARRATOR:
In May 2002, Jimmy Carter went to Cuba, the first American president to visit the island in over 40 years.
(crowd cheering )
(speaking Spanish ):
NARRATOR:
In an address broadcast throughout Cuba, he defied President George W. Bush by calling for an end to the decades-old US trade embargo.
I don't know what's going to happen with the Varela Project, which you said...
NARRATOR:
But he also challenged Cuban President Fidel Castro to institute democratic reforms.
I think it would be... very good if your officials would decide to publish the entire document, and let there be a free and open debate in Cuba.
NARRATOR:
In his travels throughout the world,
Carter has championed the cause of the poor and the disenfranchised.
DAN CARTER:
He speaks, often eloquently and angrily, about the growing gap between rich and poor and black and white-- this very cautious and conservative, fiscally responsible president.
You'd hear him sometimes now and you think we've got the last socialist in America.
NARRATOR:
With the Carter Center, President and Mrs. Carter have created programs to fight disease-- river blindness, guinea worm-- and alleviate hunger.
CHIP CARTER:
They have so much to give, and they feel like so many people depend on them.
They'll come in and see somebody that has nothing and think, "Hey, I can change that life."
HERTZBERG:
Being a good post-president doesn't retrospectively make you a better president.
What a post-presidency can do, though, is to illuminate which aspects of a president's character were real and which were phony.
All of his strengths-- perseverance and dedication, integrity, those have all turned out to be very, very real.
LANCE:
He never lied to the American people, he kept the peace, he brought the hostages home without loss of life-- all the things that he said he was going to do.
It was a time when we needed that sort of person as president that people could put some faith and trust in.
BRINKLEY:
What was Carter?
He never had a kind of nutshell program.
He had no interest in either the New Deal tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, or the New Frontier tradition of John Kennedy, or the Great Society of Lyndon Johnson.
He never crystallized a great agenda of what he wanted to do.
He simply tackled issues as they confronted him, one by one by one.
ROSALYNN CARTER:
We have not had time to look back and regret things, although I still think the country would be better off if Jimmy had been president for another term.
But then if he had been president for another term, we might not have had the Carter Center.
MONDALE:
He's been at it full time, around the clock, with that same dedication, that same laser-like concentration, until finally now, the American people are seeing all of this happen, and people say, "Hey, here's really a good man."
HERTZBERG:
I think history is going to look at him in a kindlier light than his contemporaries did.
His values, his devotion to peace and human rights, keep on resonating in a way that his failures and weaknesses don't.

Man:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND MRS. NIXON
MR. AND MRS. DAVID EISENHOWER, MR. AND MRS. EDWARD COX.
Narrator:
ON AUGUST 9, 1974
RICHARD MILHOUS NIXON BECAME THE FIRST PRESIDENT
IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES TO RESIGN FROM OFFICE.
HIS STAFF GATHERED IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO BID HIM FAREWELL
AS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WATCHED ON TELEVISION
SOME IN SORROW AND DISBELIEF, OTHERS GLAD TO SEE HIM GO.
RICHARD NIXON HAD ACCOMPLISHED GREAT THINGS AS PRESIDENT
AND HAD BEEN REELECTED OVERWHELMINGLY
BUT HE WAS ALSO WIDELY DISTRUSTED, SOMETIMES RIDICULED
EVEN DESPISED.
YOU'RE HERE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO US
AND WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD WORD FOR IT IN ENGLISH.
THE BEST IS AU REVOIR.
WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.
( applause )
Man:
RICHARD NIXON WAS STUDIEDLY DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ONE PERSON--
INCLUDING HIS WIFE, PROBABLY-- WHO COULD SIT DOWN AND WRITE
THE DEFINITIVE EXPLANATION OF RICHARD NIXON.
WE ALL SAW HIM DIFFERENTLY.
( applause )
Narrator:
HE WAS A TIRELESS CAMPAIGNER
A SURVIVOR OF MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
OF POLITICAL BATTLE
YET SO SELF-CONSCIOUS THAT HE DISLIKED SHAKING HANDS
AND FOUND IT HARD TO LOOK ANYONE IN THE EYE.
AND I INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EXPOSE THE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE SOLD THIS COUNTRY DOWN THE RIVER
UNTIL WE HAVE DRIVEN ALL THE CROOKS AND THE COMMUNISTS
AND THOSE THAT DEFEND THEM OUT OF WASHINGTON.
Narrator:
HE ROSE TO POWER AS A CRUSADER AGAINST COMMUNISM
ONLY TO MAKE HIS MOST LASTING MARK
BUILDING BRIDGES TO CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION.
HE HAD MILLIONS OF ADMIRERS ALL OVER THE WORLD
BUT TRUSTED ALMOST NO ONE
AND IN THE END WAS LEFT TO FACE HIS ENEMIES ALONE.
THE ADVICE HE OFFERED HIS STAFF IN HIS LAST SPEECH AS PRESIDENT
STIRRED THE THICK AUGUST AIR WITH ADMONITIONS
THAT SEEMED TO APPLY MOST APTLY TO NIXON HIMSELF.
ALWAYS GIVE YOUR BEST
NEVER GET DISCOURAGED, NEVER BE PETTY.
ALWAYS REMEMBER, OTHERS MAY HATE YOU
BUT THOSE WHO HATE YOU DON'T WIN UNLESS YOU HATE THEM...
AND THEN YOU DESTROY YOURSELF.
Man:
IT'S STRUCK ME FROM TIME TO TIME
THAT NIXON AS A CHARACTER WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY TO FIX
IN THE SENSE OF REMOVING THESE RATHER PETTY FLAWS
AND YET I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU DID THIS
YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REMOVED
THAT VERY INNER CORE OF INSECURITY
THAT LED TO HIS DRIVE.
A SECURE NIXON ALMOST SURELY, IN MY VIEW
WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AT ALL.

Nixon:
I REMEMBER MY OLD MAN.
I THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM
A SORT OF LITTLE MAN, COMMON MAN.
HE DIDN'T CONSIDER HIMSELF THAT WAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS?
HE WAS A STREETCAR MOTORMAN FIRST, AND THEN HE WAS A FARMER
AND THEN HE HAD A LEMON RANCH
AND THEN HE WAS A GROCER.
BUT HE WAS A GREAT MAN.
Narrator:
"RICHARD HAD HIS FATHER'S FIRE"
HIS MOTHER, HANNAH MILHOUS NIXON, ONCE SAID, "AND MY TACT."
SHE SEEMED THE OPPOSITE OF THE LOUD, AGGRESSIVE HUSBAND
HER QUAKER FAMILY ALWAYS BELIEVED BENEATH HER--
SOFT-SPOKEN, TIGHTLY CONTROLLED
NEVER ALLOWING ANGER TO GET THE BETTER OF HER.
SHE INSISTED HER SECOND SON BE CALLED RICHARD, NOT DICK
TAUGHT HIM TO READ BEFORE HE ENTERED SCHOOL
AND MADE SURE HE SAID HIS PRAYERS DAILY
AND WENT FOUR TIMES TO QUAKER MEETING ON SUNDAYS.
Woman:
I TAUGHT RICHARD NIXON
IN THE SECOND GRADE HERE IN YORBA LINDA.
HE SAT IN THE BACK SEAT AND ALWAYS CAME TO SCHOOL
WITH A WHITE, STARCHED SHIRT WITH LONG SLEEVES.
HE WAS ALWAYS A QUIET, DIGNIFIED LITTLE FELLOW
AND A VERY GOOD STUDENT.
Narrator:
HE WAS CLUMSY BUT DOGGED AT GAMES
SHY BUT GIFTED AT RECITING POETRY
AND FULL OF HIS FATHER'S ENTHUSIASM FOR POLITICS.
Man:
DICK WAS POLITICALLY INCLINED AS A KID.
I REMEMBER WALKING TO SCHOOL
AND I THINK IT WAS WHEN HARDING WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
AND OLD DICK WAS THERE ON A STUMP
SAYING WHY EVERYBODY SHOULD VOTE FOR HARDING.
Narrator:
THE NIXONS MOVED TO NEARBY WHITTIER WHEN RICHARD WAS NINE.
FOUNDED BY QUAKERS IN 1887
IT WAS A SOBER, INDUSTRIOUS COMMUNITY:
NO LIQUOR STORES, NO BARS, NO DANCE HALLS.
FRANK NIXON BOUGHT A GAS STATION ALONG THE HIGHWAY
AND SOON ADDED A GENERAL STORE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY WORKED
OFTEN 16 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.
ONE THING MY MOTHER AND DAD ALWAYS USED TO SAY
WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP--
I DON'T MEAN MY MOTHER
BECAUSE SHE WAS A LITTLE BIASED--
BUT MY DAD USED TO SAY WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, YOU BOYS"--
SPEAKING TO ME PARTICULARLY--
"YOU BOYS HAVE GOT TO GET OUT AND SCRATCH.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE ON YOUR GOOD LOOKS."
Narrator:
WHEN RICHARD WAS 12
HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, ARTHUR, SUDDENLY FELL ILL AND DIED
AND WITHIN EIGHT YEARS
HAROLD, THE ELDEST BROTHER AND FAMILY FAVORITE
WOULD SUCCUMB TO TUBERCULOSIS.
HANNAH NIXON RECALLED, "IT WAS ARTHUR'S PASSING
"THAT FIRST STIRRED WITHIN RICHARD A DETERMINATION
"TO HELP MAKE UP FOR OUR LOSS BY MAKING US VERY PROUD OF HIM.
"HE MAY HAVE FELT A KIND OF GUILT
"THAT HAROLD AND ARTHUR WERE DEAD
AND HE WAS ALIVE," SHE REMEMBERED.
MY MOTHER WAS A SAINT.
AND I THINK OF HER, TWO BOYS DYING OF TUBERCULOSIS
NURSING FOUR OTHERS, AND SEEING EACH OF THEM DIE
AND WHEN THEY DIED, IT WAS LIKE ONE OF HER OWN.
YES, SHE WILL HAVE NO BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT HER
BUT SHE WAS A SAINT.
Narrator:
"I WOULD LIKE TO STUDY LAW
AND ENTER POLITICS FOR AN OCCUPATION"
NIXON WROTE IN THE EIGHTH GRADE
"SO THAT I MIGHT BE OF SOME GOOD TO THE PEOPLE."
NIXON WORKED HARD FOR EVERYTHING HE GOT
AND HIS SOBER, INDUSTRIOUS AIR
SOMETIMES PUT OFF HIS CONTEMPORARIES.
WHEN HE RAN FOR CLASS PRESIDENT AT WHITTIER HIGH
HE LOST TO A CANDIDATE HE LATER DISMISSED
AS AN ATHLETE AND PERSONALITY BOY.
HE WOULD NOT LOSE ANOTHER ELECTION FOR 30 YEARS.
BOTH HARVARD AND YALE INVITED NIXON TO APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS
BUT HIS DREAM OF A PRESTIGIOUS EASTERN UNIVERSITY
WAS FRUSTRATED.
IT WAS 1930, THE GREAT DEPRESSION
AND HAROLD WAS IN THE MIDST
OF HIS LONG STRUGGLE WITH TUBERCULOSIS.
"WE NEEDED RICHARD AT HOME," HANNAH NIXON REMEMBERED.
NIXON HAD TO SETTLE FOR WHITTIER COLLEGE JUST DOWN THE ROAD
AND LATER SAID HE'D NEVER FELT DISAPPOINTED.
HE SOON BECAME A BIG MAN ON THE SMALL CAMPUS.
HE WAS AN AMBITIOUS STUDENT POLITICIAN
AN ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR, A CHAMPION DEBATER.
THE WHITTIER STUDENT BODY ELECTED NIXON PRESIDENT IN 1933.
HE WAS BOTH ADMIRED AND RESENTED FOR WHAT ONE STUDENT CALLED
"AN ALMOST RUTHLESS COCKSURENESS."
THE EXCLUSIVE FRANKLIN CLUB DENIED NIXON MEMBERSHIP.
HE HELPED ORGANIZE A COMPETING CLUB
THE ORTHOGONIANS, OR SQUARE SHOOTERS
STUDENTS WHO TOOK PRIDE
IN WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE.
THEY WORE NO TIES, SERVED SPAGHETTI AND BEANS
AND ATTRACTED THE COLLEGE'S BEST ATHLETES.
NIXON LATER DENIED THERE WAS ANY CLASS DISTINCTION
BETWEEN HIS SHIRT-SLEEVED ORTHOGONIANS
AND THE TUXEDOED FRANKLINS
BUT THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, HE WOULD EMPHASIZE THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN HIS OWN MODEST BEGINNINGS
AND THE WEALTHY, PRIVILEGED BACKGROUNDS
OF HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS.
DUKE LAW SCHOOL WAS NIXON'S NEXT TRAINING GROUND
IN PERSISTENCE, SUCCESS AND FRUSTRATION.
HIS CLASSMATES CALLED HIM "GLOOMY GUS."
HE LIVED FRUGALLY, STUDIED ENDLESSLY
AND NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM A CLASSROOM CONFRONTATION.
Man:
WE HAD A PROFESSOR OF TORTS, DOUGLAS MAGGS
WHO WAS SO INTIMIDATING THAT MOST PEOPLE BACKED DOWN.
THE FIRST PERSON IN OUR CLASS

NIXON GRADUATED THIRD IN HIS CLASS
HOPING FOR A JOB WITH AN EAST COAST LAW FIRM OR THE F.B.I.

Narrator:
NIXON'S MOTHER HELPED HIM GET A JOB IN A FRIEND'S LAW OFFICE.
BUT SMALL-TOWN LAW BORED HIM

THEN, WHILE AUDITIONING FOR A LOCAL PLAY
HE FELL IN LOVE.
PAT RYAN WAS A TRUCK FARMER'S RED-HAIRED DAUGHTER
TEN MONTHS OLDER THAN HE
AND EVEN MORE ACCUSTOMED TO HARD WORK AND HARDSHIP.
SHE HAD WORKED HER WAY THROUGH COLLEGE
AS A SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR, SALESGIRL AND MOVIE EXTRA
BEFORE TAKING A TEACHING JOB AT WHITTIER HIGH.
"DON'T LAUGH," NIXON TOLD HER, EVEN BEFORE THEIR FIRST DATE
"BUT SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU."
HE PURSUED PAT FOR OVER TWO YEARS
EVEN DRIVING HER TO LOS ANGELES ON WEEKENDS
WHEN SHE HAD DATES WITH OTHER MEN
THEN WAITING AROUND TO TAKE HER HOME AGAIN.
HE MARRIED HER IN JUNE OF 1940, BUT HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS
WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FIVE MORE YEARS.
THE WORLD WAS AT WAR.
♫...
CALIFORNIA, HERE I COME.♫
Narrator:
EIGHT MONTHS AFTER PEARL HARBOR, NIXON JOINED THE NAVY
AND AS A LIEUTENANT COMMANDER WAS SENT TO THE SOLOMON ISLANDS.
HE WAS BEST REMEMBERED FOR HIS SKILL
AT SCROUNGING FOOD AND LIQUOR AND SUPPLIES
FOR THE GRATEFUL MEN WHO CALLED HIM "NICK."
AND HE LEARNED TO PLAY POKER
NOT JUST TO FILL THE TIME, BUT TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY.
Man:
HE SAID TO ME:
"DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S ANY SURE WAY TO WIN?"
AND I SAID:
"IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THE BEST HAND GOING IN
GET OUT, DROP, DON'T ANTE UP."
I SAID, "THE TROUBLE WITH THAT IS
"YOU'LL PROBABLY DROP THREE OR FOUR HANDS OUT OF FIVE
"AND IT'S VERY BORING
AND I HAVEN'T GOT THE PATIENCE TO DO IT."
WELL, TO OUR INTENSE SURPRISE, HE DID EXACTLY THAT
AND HE WON MORE FREQUENTLY THAN HE LOST
AND HE SENT HOME TO CALIFORNIA A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY.
I HAVE NO IDEA EXACTLY HOW MUCH
BUT MY ESTIMATE WAS BETWEEN $6,000 AND $7,000.
Narrator:
IT WAS HIS POKER WINNINGS
THAT HELPED FINANCE NIXON'S FIRST POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.
AT WAR'S END, HE WAS APPROACHED
BY A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN BANKERS AND BUSINESSMEN FROM WHITTIER
WHO SOUGHT A CANDIDATE TO UNSEAT
THE FIVE-TERM DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN JERRY VOORHIS.
VOORHIS, A YALE GRADUATE FROM A WEALTHY FAMILY
WAS ANATHEMA TO WHITTIER REPUBLICANS.
HE SUPPORTED LABOR, OPPOSED BIG OIL AND BIG BANKING
AND CHAMPIONED THE SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS
OF THE NEW DEAL.
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER NIXON JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY
TO RUN AGAINST HIM.
LEADING REPUBLICANS AROUND WHITTIER WERE CONFIDENT
THEY FINALLY HAD FOUND THE MAN TO DEFEAT JERRY VOORHIS.
"NIXON COMES FROM GOOD QUAKER STOCK," A LOCAL BANKER WROTE.
"HE IS A VERY AGGRESSIVE INDIVIDUAL."
ANOTHER PARTISAN SAID, "THIS MAN IS SALEABLE MERCHANDISE."
IN HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN, NIXON DEVELOPED AN APPROACH
THAT REMAINED REMARKABLY CONSISTENT
THROUGH NEARLY THREE DECADES.
THE CANDIDATE PRESENTED HIMSELF AS A FAMILY MAN
FROM A LONG TRADITION OF WORK AND SERVICE
A FIRM BELIEVER IN INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE
A CHAMPION OF THE FORGOTTEN MAN, AND AT THE SAME TIME
HE PROVED TO BE A FIERCE NO-HOLDS-BARRED COMBATANT
ACCUSING VOORHIS OF TIES TO COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONS
DISTORTING VOORHIS'S RECORD IN CONGRESS.
Man:
JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION
A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME AND TOLD ME:
"DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TELEPHONE CALLS THAT ARE BEING MADE?"
AND I SAID, NO, I DIDN'T.
"WELL," THEY SAID, "I WAS CALLED ON THE PHONE
"BY AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON WHO SIMPLY SAID
DO YOU KNOW THAT JERRY VOORHIS IS A COMMUNIST?"
AND "YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR MR. NIXON BECAUSE OF THIS FACT."
Narrator:
THE CHARACTER OF NIXON'S CAMPAIGN
SURPRISED MANY OF HIS FRIENDS.
"OF COURSE I KNEW JERRY VOORHIS WASN'T A COMMUNIST"
HE LATER TOLD A VOORHIS AIDE, "BUT I HAD TO WIN.
"THAT'S THE THING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO WIN."
ALL THE STOPS WERE PULLED AND MR. NIXON BEAT ME.
HE WAS A GOOD DEBATER.
HE WAS A CLEVER DEBATER.
I WOULDN'T DENY THAT AT ALL.
BUT...
UH...
I...
STILL FEEL THAT THERE WERE A GOOD MANY BELOW-THE-BELT BLOWS
STRUCK IN THE CAMPAIGN.

APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE A SENSATIONAL CHARGE.
ALGER HISS, PROTEGE OF OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES
AIDE TO FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT AT YALTA
AND ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS
WAS, SAID CHAMBERS, A COMMUNIST
INTENT UPON INFILTRATING THE HIGHEST OFFICES OF GOVERNMENT.
Chambers:
MR. HISS...
REPRESENTS THE CONCEALED ENEMY
AGAINST WHICH WE ARE ALL FIGHTING AND I AM FIGHTING.
MY CONTACTS WITH ANY FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE
WHO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A COMMUNIST
HAVE BEEN STRICTLY OFFICIAL.
Narrator:
MOST OBSERVERS FOUND HISS PERSUASIVE
BUT NIXON HAD LEARNED THROUGH FATHER JOHN CRONIN
A CATHOLIC PRIEST WITH F.B.I. CONNECTIONS
THAT HISS HAD BEEN UNDER SUSPICION FOR YEARS.
NIXON INSISTED THE HEARINGS CONTINUE.
Newsreel announcer:
"WHO'S THE LIAR" MIGHT WELL BE THE TITLE OF THE DRAMA
WHICH UNFOLDS BEFORE A PACKED CAUCUS ROOM
WHERE THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE MEMBERS
SWEAR IN ALGER HISS.
Narrator:
THE HEARINGS WERE HIGH DRAMA.
RUMORS SPREAD THAT CHAMBERS WAS A PSYCHOPATH.
HISS CLAIMED NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN HIM.
PRESIDENT TRUMAN DENOUNCED THE PROCEEDINGS
AS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED
AND ORDERED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REFUSE TO COOPERATE.
NIXON CHARGED THAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE MOUNTING A COVER-UP.
THE FRESHMAN CONGRESSMAN FROM WHITTIER
HAD PUT HIMSELF IN THE CENTER OF IT ALL.
Man:
NIXON REALIZED
THAT ONCE HE HAD COMMITTED HIMSELF,
THAT IF EVERYTHING COLLAPSED, IF HISS WAS EXONERATED
OR IF THE CHARGES WERE NOT PROVED TO THE HILT
HE WOULD BE BADLY HURT.
NOW, I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY HURT
BUT CERTAINLY, I THINK, IF THAT HAD HAPPENED
RICHARD NIXON WOULD NEVER HAVE BECOME A SENATOR
AND NEVER WOULD HAVE BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Narrator:
"HE IMMERSED HIMSELF IN THE CASE
WITH AN ABSORPTION THAT WAS ALMOST FRIGHTENING"
PAT NIXON REMEMBERED.
WHEN OTHERS WERE READY TO DROP THE CASE
NIXON AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR ROBERT STRIPLING
TALKED THEM OUT OF IT.
THEY WERE SURE HISS WAS LYING
WHEN HE CLAIMED NOT EVEN TO HAVE KNOWN CHAMBERS
AND THEY SET OUT TO PROVE IT.
WE WENT OUT AND GOT MR. CHAMBERS
PUT HIM IN THE GRAND JURY ROOM.
WE PUT HIM UNDER OATH, AND WE SAID, IN EFFECT
"YOU CLAIM YOU KNOW MR. HISS;
TELL US ALL ABOUT HIM.
"WHAT DID HE CALL HIS WIFE?
"WHAT DID SHE CALL HIM?
"DID THEY HAVE A DOG?
"DID THEY HAVE A VETERINARIAN?
"DID THEY HAVE A DOCTOR?
"DID THEY HAVE A COOK?
GIVE US THE HOUSEKEEPING DETAILS BEGINNING AT THE FRONT DOOR."
AND HE RATTLED ON FOR TWO HOURS.
IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT HE INDEED DID KNOW MR. HISS
AND QUITE WELL.
THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER FACTOR WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT
AND THAT WAS A KIND OF PERSONAL ANIMUS.
HISS WAS ARROGANT ON THE STAND
AND HE RUBBED NIXON THE WRONG WAY
AND HE SNAPPED AT NIXON A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND SO ON.
AND IT BECAME, I THINK, ALSO A PERSONAL THING FOR NIXON.
HE SAW THAT IT COULD BE A BIG ISSUE
AND HIS WHOLE TEMPERAMENT MADE HIM WANT TO PURSUE IT.
Chambers:
I BELIEVE THAT I WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO MR. HISS
BY HAROLD WARE AND J. PETERS.
Narrator:
CHAMBERS, NOW FIGHTING A LIBEL SUIT
LEVELED A STILL MORE SENSATIONAL CHARGE
ONE HE HAD NOT YET SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE.
HE CLAIMED THAT HISS HAD ACTUALLY BEEN A SPY
BEFORE THE WAR, COPYING SECRET STATE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS
WHICH CHAMBERS HIMSELF HAD PASSED ON TO A SOVIET CONTACT.
NIXON WAS FURIOUS THAT CHAMBERS HAD BEEN HOLDING OUT ON HIM.
HE ORDERED ANY EVIDENCE CHAMBERS MIGHT HAVE SUBPOENAED
THEN LEFT WITH HIS WIFE
ON A LONG-DELAYED CARIBBEAN VACATION.
Announcer:
IN THE LATEST SENSATIONAL TURN OF THE RED ESPIONAGE PROBE
THE MARYLAND FARM OF THE MAGAZINE EDITOR
BECOMES THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION.
Narrator:
FROM A HOLLOWED-OUT PUMPKIN
CHAMBERS PRODUCED APPARENT PROOF OF ESPIONAGE--
MICROFILM OF STOLEN DOCUMENTS.
NIXON MADE THE NATION'S FRONT PAGES
WHEN HE WAS PLUCKED FROM MID-OCEAN
AND FLOWN BACK TO WASHINGTON FOR A PRESS CONFERENCE.
I AM HOLDING IN MY HAND A MICROFILM
OF VERY HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET STATE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS...
Narrator:
THE MICROFILM, KNOWN AS THE "PUMPKIN PAPERS"
PROVIDED THE EVIDENCE AND THE PUBLICITY NIXON NEEDED.
FINALLY, AFTER TWO CONTROVERSIAL TRIALS
HISS WAS FOUND GUILTY OF PERJURY AND IMPRISONED.
THE HISS CASE POLARIZED AMERICAN OPINION ABOUT RICHARD NIXON.
TO CONSERVATIVES
HE HAD FEARLESSLY ROOTED OUT A DANGEROUS SUBVERSIVE
BUT IN THE EYES OF MANY LIBERALS
NIXON HAD DESTROYED AN HONORABLE MAN
AND SET THE STAGE FOR MORE UNSCRUPULOUS COMMUNIST HUNTERS
BUT THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT AT THE AGE OF 35
THE CONGRESSMAN FROM WHITTIER HAD BECOME A NATIONAL FIGURE.
( explosion )
Narrator:
1950-
- THE RUSSIANS HAD EXPLODED AN ATOMIC BOMB OF THEIR OWN.
JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG WERE CHARGED
WITH GIVING THE SOVIETS ATOMIC SECRETS.
COMMUNISTS TOOK CONTROL OF MAINLAND CHINA.
IN KOREA, COMMUNIST TROOPS POURED ACROSS THE 38th PARALLEL
AND AMERICAN SOLDIERS WERE SENT TO STOP THEM.
SENATOR JOSEPH McCARTHY CHARGED
THAT COMMUNISTS IN GOVERNMENT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT ALL.
AND CALL THE ROLLS---
AND CALL THE ROLLS OF TRAITORS...
AND CONGRESSMAN NIXON HAD HIS SIGHTS ON THE SENATE.
HIS OPPONENT WAS
THREE-TERM CONGRESSWOMAN HELEN GAHAGAN DOUGLAS.
LIKE JERRY VOORHIS, SHE WAS WEALTHY, WELL EDUCATED
AND AN OUTSPOKEN NEW DEALER.
SHE CONDEMNED THE FEAR OF INTERNAL COMMUNISM AS IRRATIONAL
AND OPPOSED THE VERY EXISTENCE
OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES.
POLITICIANS IN BOTH PARTIES CALLED THE FORMER ACTRESS
A "BLEEDING-HEART LIBERAL," A "DO-GOODER"
A "HOLLYWOOD PARLOR PINK."
CONGRESSMAN JOHN F. KENNEDY QUIETLY GAVE NIXON $1,000
TO HELP DEFEAT HER, SAYING, "IT WON'T BREAK MY HEART
IF YOU CAN TURN THE SENATE'S LOSS INTO HOLLYWOOD'S GAIN."
MRS. DOUGLAS WAS A PERFECT TARGET FOR WHAT NIXON CALLED
HIS "ROCKING, SOCKING" STYLE OF CAMPAIGNING.
IMPLYING THE CONGRESSWOMAN WAS PRO-COMMUNIST
HE DISTRIBUTED A FLYER ON PINK PAPER
SHOWING MRS. DOUGLAS HAD VOTED
WITH THE CONTROVERSIAL LEFT-WING CONGRESSMAN VITO MARCANTONIO 354 TIMES.
THE FACT THAT MOST DEMOCRATS
AND A GOOD MANY REPUBLICANS HAD VOTED THE SAME WAY WAS IGNORED.
NIXON CHARGED THAT HIS OPPONENT
WAS "PINK RIGHT DOWN TO HER UNDERWEAR."
MRS. DOUGLAS FOUGHT BACK HARD, CALLING NIXON A "PEEWEE"
WHO IS TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE INTO VOTING FOR HIM.
AND SHE GAVE HIM THE NICKNAME HE WOULD NEVER ENTIRELY SHAKE--
"TRICKY DICK."
Woman:
WHEN RICHARD NIXON RAN FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
UNSEATED JERRY VOORHIS
IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF CAMPAIGN AS HE WAGED AGAINST ME IN 1950.
BUT THE ESSENCE OF THAT KIND OF CAMPAIGN IS THIS:
TO AVOID THE ISSUES
YOU WORK UP BOGUS ISSUES--
TRYING TO PLAY ON THE FEARS OF PEOPLE.
BECAUSE IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES, YOU MAY LOSE VOTES.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
Narrator:
OTHER CANDIDATES EMPLOYED SCARE TACTICS THAT YEAR
BUT FEW WERE MORE BLATANT THAN RICHARD NIXON'S.
"PEOPLE REACT TO FEAR," HE ONCE TOLD AN AIDE, "NOT LOVE.
THEY DON'T TEACH THAT IN SUNDAY SCHOOL, BUT IT'S TRUE."
NIXON DEFEATED MRS. DOUGLAS BY ALMOST 700,000 VOTES--
THE LARGEST PLURALITY WON
BY ANY SENATORIAL CANDIDATE IN THE COUNTRY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE PROBABLY WONDER HOW IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR A CANDIDATE TO BE ELECTED INTO ANY OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA
WHEN HE IS A MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
I HAVE JUST HAD THAT EXPERIENCE
AND I SHOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THE REASON
FOR OUR ELECTION VICTORY.
IT'S BECAUSE IN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION, THE ISSUES
RATHER THAN THE PARTISAN LABELS OF THE CANDIDATES,
WERE WHAT GOVERNED THE ELECTORATE.
I THINK THE MAJOR ISSUE...
Man:
RICHARD NIXON DOES NOT SIMPLY
DEFEAT JERRY VOORHIS FOR THE CONGRESS
OR DEFEAT HELEN GAHAGAN DOUGLAS FOR THE SENATE IN 1950.
HE DESTROYS THESE PEOPLE POLITICALLY
AND VERY NEARLY PERSONALLY.
AND HE DOES THAT IN SUCH A WAY
AS TO LEAVE A GREAT LEGACY OF BITTERNESS
AMONG THEIR SUPPORTERS, AND EVEN AMONG ONLOOKERS--
PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF NEUTRAL OBSERVERS ON THE SIDE.
Announcer:
CHICAGO IS A CITY DIVIDED
AS THOUSANDS OF DELEGATES AND OBSERVERS STREAM INTO THE CITY
FOR THE 25th REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
PARTISANSHIP RUNS HIGH.
AND THE TRAPPINGS OF THE GRAND OLD PARTY
DOMINATE THE SCENE
BEFORE THE SERIOUS BUSINESS GETS UNDER WAY.
Narrator:
AFTER ONLY A YEAR AND A HALF IN THE SENATE
NIXON WAS A LEADING CANDIDATE
FOR THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION.
Announcer:
AND HERE COMES "MR. REPUBLICAN" HIMSELF, SENATOR ROBERT TAFT.
Narrator:
TAFT PARTISANS-- CONSERVATIVE AND ISOLATIONIST--
APPLAUDED NIXON'S FERVENT ANTI-COMMUNISM
WHILE EISENHOWER'S MORE LIBERAL, INTERNATIONALIST BACKERS
WERE ATTRACTED TO NIXON'S SUPPORT OF THE MARSHALL PLAN
AND HIS COMMITMENT TO REBUILDING POSTWAR EUROPE.
THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION WAS PLEDGED
TO ITS FAVORITE SON, GOVERNOR EARL WARREN.
BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, NIXON LOBBIED HARD
FOR THE NOMINATION OF EISENHOWER.
HE WAS A MAN WITH NO SET IDEOLOGY
NO SET, REAL DEEP-DOWN PRINCIPLES.
HE WASN'T A TAFT REPUBLICAN
HE WASN'T AN EISENHOWER REPUBLICAN
HE WAS A NIXON REPUBLICAN.
Announcer:
WITH NEW YORK'S BIG BLOC OF VOTES
THE ISSUE IS NO LONGER IN DOUBT
AND A WILDLY CHEERING CONVENTION HAILS ITS NOMINEE
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, SOLDIER AND STATESMAN.
Narrator:
AWAY FROM THE CONVENTION FLOOR, EISENHOWER HUDDLED WITH NIXON.
THE YOUNG SENATOR REPRESENTED
THE GROWING POWER OF THE WEST COAST.
AND HE WAS A ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE CAMPAIGNER.
THE GENERAL OFFERED HIM THE VICE-PRESIDENCY.
AND AS WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPUBLICAN CAUSE
WHAT WE WILL DO IS TO FORGE A GREAT VICTORY
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEXT NOVEMBER.
BUT A VICTORY WHICH WILL BE A VICTORY
NOT ONLY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
BUT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT, IT WILL BE A VICTORY FOR AMERICA
AND FOR THE CAUSE OF FREE PEOPLES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
( applause )
Narrator:
EISENHOWER INTENDED TO KEEP TO THE HIGH ROAD
HE TOLD HIS RUNNING MATE.
IT WAS UP TO NIXON TO FLAIL THE DEMOCRATS
AND THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, ADLAI STEVENSON.
THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND
AS TO THE LOYALTY OF MR. STEVENSON.
BUT THE QUESTION IS ONE AS TO HIS JUDGMENT.
MANY GOOD AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED
BY THE WAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMAN AND GOVERNOR STEVENSON
HAVE BOTH ATTEMPTED TO RIDICULE AND POOH-POOH
THE COMMUNIST THREAT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.
YOU READ ABOUT ANOTHER BRIBE.
YOU READ ABOUT ANOTHER TAX FIX.
YOU READ ABOUT ANOTHER GANGSTER GETTING FAVORS
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
THE PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF IT.
THEY'RE OUTRAGED
AND THEY WANT SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT.
AND THEY'RE TIRED OF AN ADMINISTRATION
WHICH INSTEAD OF CLEANING UP
IS COVERING UP THE SCANDALS IN WASHINGTON
AT THE PRESENT TIME.
Narrator:
SUDDENLY NIXON FACED A SCANDAL OF HIS OWN.
THE NEW YORK POST REPORTED
THAT WEALTHY SUPPORTERS HAD SET UP A SECRET FUND
FOR NIXON'S PERSONAL USE.
Nixon:
AND IF THAT WERE TRUE, LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL
THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION
FOR THE VICE-PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
AND IF IT WERE TRUE,
I WOULD GET OFF THE TICKET RIGHT AWAY.
BUT IT IS NOT TRUE...
Narrator:
IN FACT, THE FUND WAS NOT SECRET
AND WAS EARMARKED EXCLUSIVELY FOR POLITICAL EXPENSES.
BUT THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE.
AIDES URGED EISENHOWER TO DROP NIXON FROM THE TICKET.
EVEN REPUBLICAN NEWSPAPERS DEMANDED HE RESIGN.
Woman:
WHEN THOSE HEADLINES FIRST CAME IN THE PAPER
I JUST WANTED TO HIDE THAT PAPER.
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE IT.
I COULDN'T EAT.
I KNEW THAT IT WASN'T TRUE, BUT WHAT COULD I DO?
Man:
WELL, WHEN THE WORLD SEEMED BLACKEST--
AND THE WHOLE NIXON CAMPAIGN HAD HALTED IN PORTLAND, OREGON--
I GOT A TELEGRAM FROM HIS MOTHER.
I TOOK IT IN TO HIM AND GAVE IT TO HIM
AND HE WAS SITTING IN A LARGE CHAIR WITH HIS ARMS ON THE SIDE
ALMOST LIKE THE LINCOLN STATUE
THAT YOU SEE IN WASHINGTON, THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL
AND I HANDED HIM THE TELEGRAM AND HE READ IT
AND HE DROPPED IT IN THE CHAIR
AND HIS HEAD FELL FORWARD, AND TEARS CAME DOWN HIS EYES.
AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE'D BEEN TERRIBLY MOVED
BY WHAT ALL THIS MEANT.
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM TO PROVE TO HIS MOTHER
THAT HE HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
Narrator:
WAS NIXON ON OR OFF THE TICKET?
GENERAL EISENHOWER HAD BEEN FRUSTRATINGLY SILENT.
FINALLY, AFTER THREE DAYS OF WAITING
A WEARY, ANXIOUS NIXON RECEIVED EISENHOWER'S PHONE CALL.
AND HE SAID, "GENERAL," HE SAID, "I'M JUST RICHARD NIXON.
AND HE SAID, "I'M JUST A VERY YOUNG GUY
"THAT DOESN'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL.
"BUT," HE SAID, I MUST TELL YOU, GENERAL,
"THAT THERE COMES A TIME, EVEN IN YOUR LIFE
WHEN YOU HAVE TO SHIT OR GET OFF THE POT."
AND THERE WAS THIS DEAD SILENCE
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER THE BALL GAME WAS OVER RIGHT THEN OR NOT.
BUT EISENHOWER SEEMED TO TAKE IT AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE GIVEN
AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION--
AS HE TOLD NIXON ON THE PHONE
HE REPORTED TO US AFTER THE CONVERSATION--
THAT NIXON SHOULD GO TO CALIFORNIA
AND MAKE A NATIONWIDE SPEECH
EXPLAINING ALL THE DETAILS OF THIS SO-CALLED SECRET FUND
AND THAT HE WOULD AUTHORIZE THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE
TO PAY FOR THE COST.
Narrator:
NIXON SECLUDED HIMSELF IN LOS ANGELES
AND PREPARED TO USE THE YOUNG MEDIUM OF TELEVISION
AS IT HAD NEVER BEEN USED BEFORE.
HE WOULD BYPASS THE PRESS, BYPASS EVEN EISENHOWER
AND PLEAD HIS CASE DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THIS PRIME-TIME BROADCAST WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN
AS "THE CHECKERS SPEECH," AND WIDEN THE GAP
BETWEEN NIXON'S ADMIRERS AND HIS DETRACTORS.
TO SOME, HE SEEMED HUMBLE, HONEST, SINCERE;
TO OTHERS, SELF-RIGHTEOUS AND SHAMELESSLY MANIPULATIVE.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I COME BEFORE YOU TONIGHT
AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE VICE-PRESIDENCY
AND AS A MAN WHOSE HONESTY AND INTEGRITY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED.
AND SO NOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO--
AND INCIDENTALLY, THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED
IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS--
I AM GOING AT THIS TIME
TO GIVE TO THIS TELEVISION AND RADIO AUDIENCE
A COMPLETE FINANCIAL HISTORY--
EVERYTHING I'VE EARNED, EVERYTHING I'VE SPENT
EVERYTHING I OWE.
I DON'T REMEMBER TALKING TO HIS MOTHER.
BUT HIS FATHER, HE THOUGHT HE REALLY DID ALL RIGHT.
HE SAID, "I HATED TO HEAR HIM SAY SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAID
"BUT HE TOLD THE TRUTH
"AND THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR
AND THAT'S...
DID THE JOB FOR HIM."
FIRST OF ALL, WE'VE GOT A HOUSE IN WASHINGTON
WHICH COST $41,000 AND ON WHICH WE OWE $20,000.
WE HAVE A HOUSE IN WHITTIER, CALIFORNIA, WHICH COST $13,000
AND ON WHICH WE OWE $3,000.
MY FOLKS ARE LIVING THERE AT THE PRESENT TIME.
Narrator:
HIS WIFE ASKED HIM
"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE HOW LITTLE WE HAVE
AND HOW MUCH WE OWE?"
"PEOPLE IN POLITICAL LIFE HAVE TO LIVE IN A GOLDFISH BOWL,"
HE ANSWERED.
"BUT I KNEW IT WAS A WEAK EXPLANATION
FOR THE HUMILIATION I WAS ASKING HER TO ENDURED."
I SHOULD SAY THIS, THAT PAT DOESN'T HAVE A MINK COAT.
BUT SHE DOES HAVE A RESPECTABLE, REPUBLICAN, CLOTH COAT
AND I ALWAYS TELL HER THAT SHE'D LOOK GOOD IN ANYTHING.
Narrator:
THE CLOTH COAT REMARK WAS AIMED AT THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION
THEN PLAGUED BY MINK COAT BRIBERY CHARGES.
NEXT, NIXON BORROWED A TECHNIQUE FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT:
HE TALKED ABOUT HIS DOG.
"USING THE SAME PLOY AS F.D.R.," HE WROTE IN HIS MEMOIRS
"WOULD IRRITATE MY OPPONENTS AND DELIGHT MY FRIENDS."
WE DID GET SOMETHING-
- A GIFT-- AFTER THE ELECTION.
IT WAS A LITTLE COCKER SPANIEL DOG-
- BLACK AND WHITE SPOTTED.
AND OUR LITTLE GIRL, TRICIA, THE SIX-YEAR-OLD, NAMED IT CHECKERS.
AND YOU KNOW, THE KIDS, LIKE ALL KIDS, LOVE THE DOG.
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS RIGHT NOW
THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HIM.
Nixon:
I WOULD DO NOTHING THAT WOULD HARM THE POSSIBILITIES
OF DWIGHT EISENHOWER TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND FOR THAT REASON, I AM SUBMITTING
TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE TONIGHT
THROUGH THIS TELEVISION BROADCAST
THE DECISION WHICH IS THEIRS TO MAKE.
WIRE AND WRITE THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
WHETHER YOU THINK I SHOULD STAY ON
OR WHETHER I SHOULD GET OFF.
AND WHATEVER THEIR DECISION IS, I WILL ABIDE BY IT.
I HAVE BEEN A WARRIOR, AND I LIKE COURAGE.
AND TONIGHT I SAW AN EXAMPLE OF COURAGE.
Man:
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR
OF NIXON CONTINUING AS A CANDIDATE
WILL SAY "AYE!"
Crowd:
AYE!
Man:
I HAD CALLED SOME REPUBLICAN FRIENDS OF MINE
AND HAD ASKED THEM TO SEND TELEGRAMS TO NIXON
SAYING, "DON'T DROP OFF THE TICKET."
AND THEY HAD REFUSED.
AND I WAS WITH SOME OF THEM WHEN I WATCHED THE CHECKERS SPEECH
AND AFTERWARDS, EVERY ONE OF THEM SENT A TELEGRAM TO NIXON
SAYING, "GREAT JOB-- STAY ON THE TICKET."
Narrator:
NIXON STAYED ON THE TICKET
THAT WAS SWEPT INTO OFFICE IN NOVEMBER--
THE FIRST REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION IN TWO DECADES.
Man:
DURING THE EISENHOWER YEARS, NIXON BECAME THE POINT MAN.
EISENHOWER NEVER EXPECTED
TO HAVE TO GET INTO TOO MUCH POLITICAL DISCUSSION.
BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS HE PUT YOUNG SENATOR NIXON
ON THE TICKET
BECAUSE HE COULD DO THAT.
SO ALL THE TOUGH POLITICAL ASSIGNMENTS
USUALLY WERE GIVEN TO NIXON.
ALL THE DEMOCRAT CONGRESS OFFERS IF ELECTED THIS YEAR
IS A RETURN TO THE POLICIES OF THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION.
Morris:
HE'S A VERY PARTISAN CREATURE, AFTER ALL.
AND HE BECOMES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, REALLY THE FOCUS
OF GENUINE CRITICISM IN THE PRESS.
HE HAS ENJOYED ENORMOUS IMMUNITY IN THE PRESS
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY
UP UNTIL THE '52 CAMPAIGN.
AND HE SUFFERS HIS FIRST TARNISH IN THE FUND EPISODE
AND THAT GETS WORSE AND WORSE
UNTIL HERBLOCK BEGINS TO GIVE HIM A HEAVY BEARD
IN CARTOONS IN THE WASHINGTON POST
AND HE COMES UNDER SOMETIMES VICIOUS
OFTEN VERY TELLING AND ACCURATE ATTACK IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA.
Announcer:
A STUNNED NATION HEARS THAT ITS PRESIDENT IS STRICKEN
WITH A HEART ATTACK.
Narrator:
NIXON'S DETRACTORS HELD THEIR BREATH
DURING EISENHOWER'S ILLNESS IN SEPTEMBER 1955.
BUT THE VICE-PRESIDENT SURPRISED
EVEN HIS MOST SEVEREST CRITICS.
FOR NEARLY TWO MONTHS, NIXON WAS A CAUTIOUS SUBSTITUTE
STANDING IN FOR EISENHOWER
WHILE NOT CALLING ATTENTION TO HIMSELF.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN BE ASSURED
THAT THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT WILL GO AHEAD AS USUAL
DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S ILLNESS.
UNDER THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP,
A TEAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN WASHINGTON
WHICH WILL CARRY OUT
THE VERY WELL-DEFINED FOREIGN POLICIES AND DOMESTIC POLICIES
THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS LAID DOWN
DURING HIS FIRST 2 1/2 YEARS IN OFFICE.
Narrator:
FULLY RECOVERED, EISENHOWER ANNOUNCED
HE WOULD SEEK REELECTION
BUT DID NOT GUARANTEE NIXON A PLACE ON THE TICKET.
PRIVATELY, HE THOUGHT HIM IMMATURE, A POLITICAL LIABILITY.
BUT NIXON REFUSED TO CONSIDER THE PRESIDENT'S OFFER
OF A CABINET POSITION INSTEAD OF THE VICE-PRESIDENCY.
HE FINALLY FORCED EISENHOWER'S HAND.
I MET WITH THE PRESIDENT
THIS AFTERNOON IN THE WHITE HOUSE
AND AT THAT TIME, I INFORMED HIM
THAT IN THE EVENT THAT HE AND THE DELEGATES
TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION
DECIDED THAT IT WAS IN THE BEST INTERESTS
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
FOR ME TO CONTINUE IN MY PRESENT OFFICE
THAT I WOULD BE HONORED TO ACCEPT RENOMINATION
AS THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED ME TO SAY
THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED
TO HEAR OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT'S DECISION.
( applause )
NO MAN COULD BE MORE HIGHLY HONORED
THAN TO BE SELECTED AS THE RUNNING MATE
OF SUCH A GREAT PRESIDENT.
I ACCEPT THIS NOMINATION IN THAT SPIRIT.
Narrator:
NIXON WAS LESS AGGRESSIVE IN 1956 THAN IN EARLIER CAMPAIGNS.
THE PRESS BEGAN TO WRITE OF "A NEW NIXON."
BUT THE VICE-PRESIDENT REMAINED THE DEMOCRATS' FAVORITE TARGET.
Man:
I MUST SAY BLUNTLY
THAT EVERY PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WE HAVE
EVERY LESSON OF HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE INDICATES
THAT A REPUBLICAN VICTORY TOMORROW WOULD MEAN
THAT RICHARD NIXON WOULD PROBABLY BE
PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
I SAY FRANKLY, AS A CITIZEN MORE THAN A CANDIDATE
THAT I RECOIL AT THE PROSPECT OF MR. NIXON
AS CUSTODIAN OF THIS NATION'S FUTURE
AS GUARDIAN OF THE HYDROGEN BOMB
AS REPRESENTATIVE OF AMERICA IN THE WORLD
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.
Announcer:
AS EVENING RETURNS COME IN, THE TREND IS UNMISTAKABLE.
IT'S EISENHOWER BY A LANDSLIDE
WITH 457 ELECTORAL VOTES TO 74 FOR STEVENSON
AND A NINE-MILLION-VOTE PLURALITY.
I, RICHARD M. NIXON, DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR...
Narrator:
NIXON WAS A SURVIVOR.
HE HAD OVERCOME EISENHOWER'S INDIFFERENCE
A SOMETIMES HOSTILE PRESS AND BITTER PARTISAN ATTACKS.
HE ENTERED HIS SECOND VICE-PRESIDENTIAL TERM
AS THE REPUBLICAN HEIR APPARENT.
( applause and whistling )
RICHARD NIXON WAS THE FAVORITE
TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN 1960.
EVENTS OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAD MADE HIM
ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE VICE-PRESIDENTS IN HISTORY.
DURING A TOUR OF SOUTH AMERICA
HE HAD FACED DOWN ANGRY LEFTIST MOBS
THAT SPAT UPON HIM AND HIS WIFE AND ATTACKED THEIR MOTORCADE.
MAINTAINING HIS COMPOSURE THROUGHOUT THE ORDEAL
NIXON RETURNED HOME TO A HERO'S WELCOME.
AND IN MOSCOW, HE HAD CONFRONTED
THE LEADER OF THE COMMUNIST WORLD, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV
IN AN IMPROMPTU TELEVISED DEBATE.
THERE MUST BE A FREE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.
THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES
WHERE YOU MAY BE AHEAD OF US.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE THRUST OF YOUR ROCKETS
FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF OUTER SPACE.
THERE MAY BE SOME INSTANCES--
FOR EXAMPLE, COLOR TELEVISION--
WHERE WE'RE AHEAD OF YOU.
BUT IN ORDER FOR BOTH OF US...
NYET, NYET.
...BOTH OF US TO BENEFIT...
YOU SEE, YOU NEVER CONCEDE ANYTHING!
Narrator:
NIXON'S COMBINATION OF TOUGHNESS AND HUMOR PLAYED WELL BACK HOME.
IN JULY 1960
REPUBLICANS EMBRACED HIM AS THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
Man:
IT IS DECLARED, THEREFORE, THAT VICE-PRESIDENT RICHARD M. NIXON
HAS BEEN UNANIMOUSLY NOMINATED
TO BE THE CANDIDATE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
( cheering and applause )
Narrator:
JUST 14 YEARS AFTER HE WAS TAPPED
BY A GROUP OF SMALL-TOWN BUSINESSMEN
TO RUN FOR CONGRESS IN CALIFORNIA
RICHARD NIXON STOOD AT THE TOP OF HIS PARTY.
AS HE MAPPED OUT AN AMBITIOUS 50-STATE CAMPAIGN
HE WAS CHALLENGED BY HIS OPPONENT, JOHN F. KENNEDY
TO A SERIES OF TELEVISED DEBATES--
THE FIRST IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
EVEN WHEN HOSPITALIZED FOR TWO WEEKS WITH A KNEE INJURY
NIXON REMAINED CONFIDENT, ANXIOUS FOR THE DEBATES TO BEGIN
EAGER ONCE AGAIN TO USE TELEVISION
TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS.
AT THE TIME, THERE WAS A FEELING
THAT THIS, OVERALL, MIGHT BE A MISMATCH.
NIXON WAS THE CANDIDATE WHO HAD MORE PROMINENCE
WHO HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE, A MEMBER OF THE SENATE
AND THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
KENNEDY-
- HE DIDN'T HAVE
A PARTICULARLY STRONG REPUTATION IN CONGRESS.
THERE WAS SOME FEELING THAT HE WAS, TO SOME EXTENT, A PLAYBOY
THAT HE WASN'T TOO SERIOUS A SENATOR.
SO PEOPLE FELT THAT NIXON HAD THE EDGE
AND I THINK NIXON FELT THAT HE HAD THE EDGE.
THE CANDIDATES NEED NO INTRODUCTION.
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, VICE-PRESIDENT RICHARD M. NIXON
AND THE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE, SENATOR JOHN F. KENNEDY.
ACCORDING TO RULES SET BY THE CANDIDATES THEMSELVES...
Narrator:
THE NIXON-KENNEDY DEBATES WOULD FOREVER CHANGE
THE WAY AMERICANS CHOSE THEIR PRESIDENTS.
POLITICAL RALLIES AND OLD-FASHION HANDSHAKING
BECAME MUCH LESS IMPORTANT
THAN THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN.
Rogers:
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT NIXON HIMSELF HAD SAID,
"I DON'T WANT ANY MAKEUP ON FOR THESE PARTICULAR DEBATES."
WHAT I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO DICK WAS
THAT HE HAS CERTAIN A CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS SKIN
WHERE IT'S ALMOST TRANSPARENT.
AND IT WAS A VERY NICE THOUGHT TO SAY
"YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT ANY MAKEUP"
BUT THAT HE REALLY NEEDED IT
IN ORDER TO HAVE WHAT WE WOULD CALL
EVEN AN ACCEPTABLE TELEVISION PICTURE.
AND OF COURSE, J.F.K.,
HERE HE'D BEEN RIDING IN MOTORCADES
ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WITH THE TOP DOWN.
HE LOOKED LIKE A BRONZE WARRIOR WHEN HE CAME INTO CHICAGO.
HE REALLY DID.
MR. NIXON COMES OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY--
HE WAS NOMINATED BY IT--
AND IT IS A FACT THAT THROUGH MOST OF THESE LAST 25 YEARS
THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP HAS OPPOSED
FEDERAL AID FOR EDUCATION, MEDICAL CARE FOR THE AGED...
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE POOR.
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED.
I KNOW SENATOR KENNEDY FEELS AS DEEPLY ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS
AS I DO.
BUT OUR DISAGREEMENT IS NOT ABOUT THE GOALS FOR AMERICA
BUT ONLY ABOUT THE MEANS TO REACH THOSE GOALS.
Narrator:
THE FIRST DEBATE WAS COSTLY TO NIXON.
THE RADIO AUDIENCE THOUGHT HE HAD WON
BUT THE LARGEST TELEVISION AUDIENCE IN HISTORY
HAD SEEN THE VICE-PRESIDENT HAGGARD AND DRAWN
AND HAD BEEN GIVEN ITS FIRST SUSTAINED LOOK
AT THE KENNEDY STYLE.
Man:
KENNEDY HAD A GREAT CHARM
FOR NOT ONLY THE VOTERS, BUT ALSO FOR THE PRESS.
THE PRESS CORPS HAD SORT OF A LOVE AFFAIR WITH JACK KENNEDY
AND NO MATTER WHAT THINGS WE MIGHT DO TO MAKE THINGS BETTER--
WE COULD SERVE A HOT MEAL, THEY WOULD SERVE A COLD MEAL
AND THE PRESS WOULD LIKE THE COLD BETTER--
AND SO THAT HE FELT
HE WAS RUNNING UP AGAINST IMPOSSIBLE ODDS.
AND I SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE
AS A TRAINING GROUND FOR AN INEXPERIENCED MAN
WHO IS RASH AND IMPULSIVE.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE
HAS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THESE CHANGING TIMES
WITH A REVOLUTION OF RISING EXPECTATIONS SWEEPING THE GLOBE
THE UNITED STATES HAS LOST ITS IMAGE
AS A NEW, STRONG, VITAL, REVOLUTIONARY SOCIETY.
I HAVE BEEN TO RUSSIA AND I'VE SEEN IT.
I'VE BEEN TO THE UNITED STATES, I'VE SEEN IT.
AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR A SECOND-RATE PSYCHOLOGY
ON THE PART OF ANY AMERICAN.
Reporter:
MR. VICE-PRESIDENT,
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF YOUR RECEPTION TODAY?
WELL, OF COURSE IT WAS THE GREATEST OF THE CAMPAIGN
AND I THINK THIS MEANS THAT WE'RE ON THE WAY
TO VICTORY IN NEW YORK.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU AGREE?
OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL.
Crowd:
♫WE WANT NIXON, WE WANT NIXON!
♫
♫WE WANT NIXON TO BE OUR PRESIDENT.♫
Narrator:
ELECTION NIGHT, NIXON REMEMBERED
WAS THE LONGEST NIGHT OF HIS LIFE.
IT APPEARED AT FIRST TO BE A KENNEDY SWEEP
THEN BECAME TOO CLOSE TO CALL
THEN EDGED BACK TOWARD KENNEDY AGAIN.
AND I...
PLEASE, PLEASE...
JUST A MINUTE.
AND I...
AS I LOOK AT THE BOARD HERE
WHILE THERE ARE STILL SOME RESULTS STILL TO COME IN
IF THE PRESENT TREND CONTINUES
MR. KENNEDY, SENATOR KENNEDY
WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
Crowd:
NO, NO!
I JUST...
AND I WANT...
EXCUSE ME...
Crowd:
WE WANT NIXON!
WE WANT NIXON!
WE WANT NIXON!
( chanting continues )
Narrator:
IN THE END, IT PROVED TO BE
ONE OF THE CLOSEST ELECTIONS IN HISTORY.
KENNEDY WON BY ONLY 100,000 VOTES
AND CHARGES OF DEMOCRATIC FRAUD WERE WIDESPREAD.
MUCH OF THE WINNING MARGIN CAME FROM LYNDON JOHNSON'S TEXAS
AND RICHARD J. DALEY'S CHICAGO.
BUT NIXON REFUSED TO DEMAND A RECOUNT.
"IF IT FAILED TO CHANGE THE RESULTS," HE WROTE
"CHARGES OF SORE LOSER WOULD FOLLOW ME THROUGH HISTORY
AND REMOVE ANY POSSIBILITY OF A FURTHER POLITICAL CAREER."
RICHARD NIXON IS FOREVER EMBITTERED BY THE EXPERIENCE
AND, TAKEN WITH THE EXAMPLE
I THINK FEELS THAT NEVER AGAIN WILL HE BE CAUGHT SHORT
NEVER AGAIN WILL HIS OPPONENTS OUTDO HIM
AND NEVER AGAIN WILL HE TRUST
THE ORDINARY, NORMAL AND HONEST DEVICES OF AMERICAN POLITICS
TO FUNCTION AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.
Narrator:
IN HIS LAST OFFICIAL ACT AS VICE-PRESIDENT
NIXON PRESIDED OVER A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS
ON JANUARY 6, 1961, AND ANNOUNCED HIS OWN DEFEAT.
I NOW DECLARE THAT JOHN F. KENNEDY
HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND LYNDON JOHNSON VICE-PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
SO LONG, DICK, I CERTAINLY ENJOYED
SITTING BACK HERE WITH YOU.
Kennedy:
I, JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE OFFICE
OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND WILL, TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, SO HELP ME GOD.
Man:
WELL, HE HANDLED IT SURPRISINGLY WELL.
IN FACT, HE CHEERED US UP A GOOD DEAL OF THE TIME.
HE WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG MAN.
I'M SURE HE HAD THOUGHTS OF THE FUTURE.
BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS
THAT THE FELLOW WHO DEFEATED HIM WAS A YOUNG MAN
AND ALL OF US THOUGHT THAT MEANT AT LEAST EIGHT YEARS
FOR JACK KENNEDY
AND WHAT IS NIXON GOING TO DO FOR EIGHT YEARS?
♫CALIFORNIA, HERE I COME♫
♫RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED FROM!
♫
Nixon:
I SHALL NOT BE A CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1964.
I SHALL BE A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN 1962.
♫THAT'S WHY I CAN HARDLY WAIT...♫
Narrator:
BUT NIXON HAD BEEN OUT OF TOUCH WITH CALIFORNIA FOR TOO LONG.
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST INCUMBENT GOVERNOR PAT BROWN
WAS BITTER AND EXHAUSTING.
NIXON WAS SOUNDLY DEFEATED.
REPORTERS IN LOS ANGELES WERE TOLD
THE LOSING CANDIDATE HAD LEFT AND WOULD NOT MAKE A STATEMENT.
BUT NIXON, HIS ANGER TOWARD THE PRESS BUILDING FOR YEARS
RESOLVED TO HAVE THE LAST WORD.
FOR 16 YEARS, EVER SINCE THE HISS CASE
YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN-- A LOT OF FUN.
YOU'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK ME
AND I THINK I'VE GIVEN AS GOOD AS I'VE TAKEN.
I LEAVE YOU GENTLEMEN NOW AND YOU WILL NOW WRITE IT
YOU WILL INTERPRET IT, THAT'S YOUR RIGHT.
BUT AS I LEAVE YOU, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
JUST THINK HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO BE MISSING.
YOU DON'T HAVE NIXON TO KICK AROUND ANYMORE.
BECAUSE, GENTLEMEN, THIS IS MY LAST PRESS CONFERENCE.
AND I HOPE THAT WHAT I HAVE SAID TODAY
WILL AT LEAST MAKE TELEVISION, RADIO, THE PRESS RECOGNIZE
THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT AND A RESPONSIBILITY.
THAT IF THEY'RE AGAINST A CANDIDATE, GIVE HIM THE SHAFT
BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE IF THEY GIVE HIM THE SHAFT
PUT ONE, LONELY REPORTER ON THE CAMPAIGN
WHO WILL REPORT WHAT THE CANDIDATE SAYS NOW AND THEN.
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN, AND GOOD DAY.
Narrator:
AN ANGRY, RESENTFUL RICHARD NIXON
STRODE FROM THE BEVERLY HILTON ON NOVEMBER 7, 1962
SEEMINGLY BOUND FOR POLITICAL OBLIVION.
"BARRING A MIRACLE," SAID TIME MAGAZINE
RICHARD NIXON'S POLITICAL CAREER
WAS OVER.
( applause )
( florid piano music )
Narrator:
LESS THAN SIX MONTHS
AFTER HIS HUMILIATING DEFEAT IN CALIFORNIA
NIXON APPEARED ON THE JACK PARR SHOW
PLAYING A TUNE HE HAD WRITTEN HIMSELF.
ALTHOUGH NO ONE IN THE AUDIENCE COULD HAVE KNOWN IT
THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE MOST REMARKABLE COMEBACKS
IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY.
CAN KENNEDY BE DEFEATED IN '64?
WELL, WHICH ONE?
( laughter )
JUST TO BE VERY SERIOUS
I KNOW, OF COURSE YOU'RE REFERRING TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY
AND I, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULD SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY
EVEN OF HIM OR OF HIS OFFICE.
WEREN'T YOU KIND OF FRIENDS ONCE?
OH, CERTAINLY.
WE CAME TO THE CONGRESS TOGETHER
AND WE WERE LOW MEN ON THE TOTEM POLE
IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE TOGETHER.
AND WE REMAINED LOW MEN
UNTIL HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT.
NOW HE'S UP AND I'M DOWN.
( laughter )
MY LITTLE DAUGHTER SAID TODAY
"MR. NIXON WILL BE ON?"
I SAID, "YES."
SHE SAID, "I DO HOPE THAT MAN FINDS WORK."
( laughter )
Narrator:
NIXON FOUND WORK AS A WALL STREET LAWYER
DETERMINED TO SUCCEED AT WHAT HE CALLED "THE FAST TRACK."
PAT NIXON HAD NEVER BEEN HAPPY
WITH THE CONSTANT DEMANDS OF POLITICS
AND WELCOMED THE PROSPECT OF A MORE NORMAL EXISTENCE.
"I HOPE WE NEVER MOVE AGAIN," SHE TOLD HIM
WHEN THEY SETTLED IN NEW YORK.
BUT POLITICS HAD BEEN NIXON'S WHOLE LIFE
ALL HE HAD EVER KNOWN.
HE SOON TOLD FRIENDS HE WOULD DIE OF BOREDOM
IF HE STAYED IN PRIVATE LIFE.
TV Announcer:
HERE IS A BULLETIN FROM CBS NEWS.
IN DALLAS, TEXAS, THREE SHOTS WERE FIRED
AT PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S MOTORCADE...
Narrator:
TO SOME, IT SEEMED THAT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION
MIGHT OPEN THE WAY FOR NIXON IN THE NEXT ELECTION.
BUT SENSING THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY
NIXON CONCLUDED THAT LYNDON JOHNSON, THE NEW PRESIDENT
WOULD BE UNBEATABLE IN 1964.
Interviewer:
ARE YOU WRITING YOURSELF OFF
AT THIS POINT, AS A POLITICAL CANDIDATE
AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AT ANY TIME?
WELL, I'VE MADE IT CLEAR
THAT I AM NOT A CANDIDATE FOR PUBLIC OFFICE.
I SHALL NOT BECOME A CANDIDATE IN THIS YEAR, 1964
AND I CERTAINLY HAVE NO PLANS
TO BECOME A CANDIDATE IN THE FUTURE.
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER
I AM NOT WRITING MYSELF OFF
AS A POLITICAL LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES.
Narrator:
AS NIXON EXPECTED, PRESIDENT JOHNSON OVERWHELMED
REPUBLICAN BARRY GOLDWATER IN 1964
AND THE PARTY LOST DISASTROUSLY IN CONGRESS.
BUT IN THE RUINS OF THAT DEFEAT
NIXON SAW HIS WAY BACK TO POWER.
HE WORKED THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL CIRCUIT TIRELESSLY
TRAVELED TO 35 STATES, BARNSTORMED FOR 105 CANDIDATES.
AND WHEN THE PARTY MADE A DRAMATIC COMEBACK IN 1966
THERE WAS HARDLY A REPUBLICAN WHO DIDN'T OWE NIXON A FAVOR.
Man:
HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH ALL OF THE OBLIGATORY ACTIVITIES OF POLITICS.
THOSE WERE THE DUES ONE PAID
IN ORDER TO GAIN ADMISSION TO THE ARENA, AND HE PAID THEM.
HE FLINCHED, ON OCCASION, BUT HE PAID THEM.
HE LEARNED TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO.
Nixon:
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
Man:
GOOD TO SEE YOU!
GET THIS BOY IN!
WE'RE GOING TO!
YOU GET HIM IN NOW!
Narrator:
NIXON PROMISED HIS FAMILY A MORATORIUM ON POLITICS IN 1967
BUT IMMEDIATELY TOOK OFF
ON A GRUELING TOUR OF FOUR CONTINENTS.
TRAVELING AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN
THE FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT COULD STILL COMMAND A CROWD
IN THE MOST REMOTE REACHES OF THE GLOBE.
HIS TRIPS KEPT HIM IN THE NEWS
AND STRENGTHENED HIS GRASP OF FOREIGN POLICY.
ONCE AGAIN, RICHARD NIXON WAS AIMING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
HE HAD THIS ABSOLUTELY CORE FIRE
THAT HE WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
I THINK FOR SEVERAL REASONS--
PROBABLY TO PROVE A LOT OF THINGS TO HIMSELF
BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE SINCERELY WANTED
TO TAKE THE COUNTRY IN A DIRECTION
THAT HE FELT WAS THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
Man:
OKAY!
( cheers )
Narrator:
AS NIXON OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY IN FEBRUARY, 1968
THE EVENTS OF THAT TUMULTUOUS YEAR
MOVED HIM CLOSER TO THE OFFICE HE HAD SOUGHT FOR SO LONG.
IN VIETNAM, COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS FOUGHT THEIR WAY
TO THE VERY DOORSTEP OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN SAIGON.
NEVER HAD THE PROSPECTS FOR VICTORY LOOKED MORE BLEAK.
AT HOME, ANGER OVER THE WAR TORE THE COUNTRY APART
AND FORCED LYNDON JOHNSON TO WITHDRAW
FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
ROBERT KENNEDY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO EMERGE
AS THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER
WHEN HE WAS KILLED BY AN ASSASSIN'S BULLET.
( screaming )
RACE RIOTS FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
TURNED MANY CITIES INTO BATTLEGROUNDS.
( sirens )
THE COUNTRY HAD NOT SUFFERED SUCH UPHEAVAL
SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.
MANY AMERICANS YEARNED FOR A LEADER
WHO PROMISED SAFETY AND STABILITY.
IN MIAMI BEACH
SAFE FROM THE CRISES THAT ENGULFED THE COUNTRY
THE NIXON FAMILY WATCHED
AS REPUBLICANS CHOSE THEIR CANDIDATE.
Delegate:
...for Richard M. Nixon.
THERE-
- WE WORKED FOR THOSE!
Delegate:
Wisconsin is proud to cast its 30 votes for the nominee of this convention
Richard M. Nixon...
Nixon:
SIT DOWN, GET TO WORK!
Narrator:
AS HE ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION OF HIS PARTY
NIXON OFFERED HIMSELF AS THE MAN WHO COULD BRING ORDER
OUT OF THE TURMOIL OF 1968.
WHEN THE STRONGEST NATION IN THE WORLD
CAN BE TIED DOWN FOR FOUR YEARS IN A WAR IN VIETNAM
WITH NO END IN SIGHT
WHEN THE NATION WITH THE GREATEST TRADITION
OF THE RULE OF LAW IS PLAGUED
BY UNPRECEDENTED LAWLESSNESS
WHEN A NATION THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR A CENTURY
FOR EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY IS TORN
BY UNPRECEDENTED RACIAL VIOLENCE
THEN IT'S TIME FOR NEW LEADERSHIP
FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
Narrator:
REPUBLICANS ONCE AGAIN PINNED THEIR PRESIDENTIAL HOPES
ON RICHARD NIXON.
TO THEM, AND TO MANY IN THE PRESS
HE SEEMED A NEW NIXON
BETTER PREPARED THAN THE MAN WHO HAD LOST IN 1960.
BUT THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER HUBERT HUMPHREY
SAID HE'D SEEN IT ALL BEFORE.
HE STARTED THAT RENEWAL JOB IN 1952--
BRAND NEW NIXON.
THERE WAS SOME REASON FOR IT, TOO.
THEN THEY HAD ANOTHER RENEWAL JOB IN 1956.
THEN THEY HAD ANOTHER RENOVATION OPERATION IN 1960.
THEN, WHEN HE WENT TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR
IN CALIFORNIA IN 1962, THEY RENEWED HIM AGAIN.
AND THEN IN 1964, ANOTHER TOUCH-UP.
AND NOW, I READ ABOUT THE NEW NIXON OF 1968.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--
ANYBODY THAT'S HAD HIS POLITICAL FACE LIFTED SO MANY TIMES
CAN'T BE VERY NEW.
( laughter, applause )
Narrator:
BOATING IN THE FLORIDA KEYS, NIXON WAS RELAXED AND CONFIDENT.
HE WAS RUNNING FAR AHEAD OF HUMPHREY IN THE POLLS
AND THE VIETNAM WAR WAS SPLINTERING THE DEMOCRATS.
Crowd:
WE WANT PEACE NOW!
WE WANT PEACE NOW!
Narrator:
AT THEIR CONVENTION IN CHICAGO, THE ANTI-WAR WING OF THE PARTY
PRESSED FOR AN END TO THE BOMBING
AND A NEGOTIATED WITHDRAWAL OF U.S. TROOPS.
BUT HUMPHREY STUCK BY PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S POLICY.
AND I THINK THAT WITHDRAWAL WOULD BE TOTALLY UNREALISTIC
AND WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE.
( chanting )
Narrator:
AS THE DEMOCRATS FOUGHT OVER VIETNAM
NIXON AVOIDED THE ISSUE
PROMISING ONLY THAT HE WOULD FIND
AN HONORABLE END TO THE WAR.
ALONG WITH MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
HE WATCHED ON TELEVISION
AS ANTI-WAR PROTESTS OUTSIDE THE CONVENTION HALL
EXPLODED INTO VIOLENCE.
IN THE CHAOS, NIXON SAW AN OPPORTUNITY.
A FEW DAYS LATER
HE MOVED THROUGH THE SAME STREETS IN A MOTORCADE.
400,000 PEOPLE TURNED OUT TO CHEER HIM.
HE CHOSE THE CITY WHICH HAD SEEN OPEN WAR AMONG THE DEMOCRATS
TO SOUND ONE OF THE CENTRAL THEMES OF HIS CAMPAIGN.
THIS IS A NATION OF LAWS, AND AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAS SAID
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, NO ONE IS BELOW THE LAW
AND WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE THE LAW
AND AMERICANS SHOULD REMEMBER THAT
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LAW AND ORDER.
Narrator:
THE EMPHASIS ON LAW AND ORDER
APPEALED TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
NIXON'S TELEVISION COMMERCIALS HAMMERED IT HOME.
Nixon:
IN RECENT YEARS, CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY HAS GROWN
NINE TIMES AS FAST AS POPULATION.
AT THE CURRENT RATE
THE CRIMES OF VIOLENCE IN AMERICA WILL DOUBLE BY 1972.
WE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT KIND OF FUTURE FOR AMERICA.
WE OWE IT TO THE DECENT AND LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS OF AMERICA
TO TAKE THE OFFENSIVE
AGAINST THE CRIMINAL FORCES THAT THREATEN
THEIR PEACE AND THEIR SECURITY
AND TO REBUILD RESPECT FOR LAW ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
Narrator:
TO THE DEMOCRATS, NIXON'S CALL FOR LAW AND ORDER
PLAYED TO THE WORST IN AMERICANS.
BUT YOU CAN'T VOTE YOUR ANGER, YOU HAVE TO VOTE YOUR HOPES.
YOU CAN'T VOTE YOUR HATES, YOU HAVE TO VOTE YOUR HOPES.
THE PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T JUST SAY
"DOUBLE THE RATE OF CONVICTIONS."
IT DOESN'T JUST SAY, "LAW AND ORDER."
IT SAYS, "TO ENSURE JUSTICE."
AND IF MR. NIXON HASN'T READ IT, THEN I'LL SEND HIM A COPY.
Narrator:
BUT NIXON HAD A FEEL FOR THE ISSUES
THAT MOVED THE MIDDLE AMERICAN VOTER.
THEY WERE THE SAME ISSUES THAT MOVED HIM.
BLAMING LIBERAL DEMOCRATS FOR THE UPHEAVAL IN THE COUNTRY
HE SOUGHT TO RALLY A NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.
THE NEW VOICE THAT IS BEING HEARD ACROSS AMERICA TODAY--
IT IS NOT THE VOICE OF A SINGLE PERSON.
IT'S THE VOICE OF A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS
WHO HAVE NOT BEEN THE PROTESTORS
WHO HAVE NOT BEEN THE SHOUTERS.
THE GREAT MAJORITY FINALLY HAVE BECOME ANGRY
NOT ANGRY WITH HATE,
BUT ANGRY, MY FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY LOVE AMERICA
AND THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING
TO AMERICA FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.
YOU'VE JUST HEARD RICHARD NIXON REFER TO YOU
AMONG ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE
AS "THE FORGOTTEN AMERICANS."
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S REFERRING TO?
WELL, I SORT OF THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE PAYING THE TAXES
THAT ARE SUPPORTING THE SCHOOLS, THE CHURCHES
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE...
THEY ARE SORT OF FORGOTTEN
BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S AIMED AT WELFARE AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
( band playing "Stars and Stripes forever" )
Narrator:
NIXON'S CALL TO THE FORGOTTEN AMERICANS
APPEALED TO A BROAD BAND OF VOTERS--
MOSTLY WHITE, MIDDLE CLASS, HAWKISH, PATRIOTIC.
IT WAS A GROUP THAT FELT IGNORED AND EXCLUDED
IN THE UPHEAVALS OF THE '60s
AND THE STRATEGY SEEMED TO BE WORKING.
NIXON HELD HIS STRONG LEAD INTO THE FALL.
THEN, JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION
PRESIDENT JOHNSON SUDDENLY STOPPED
THE BOMBING OF NORTH VIETNAM.
HUMPHREY SURGED IN THE POLLS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE BIGGEST ELECTION SURPRISE
THAT AMERICA HAS KNOWN IN 20 YEARS.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTION!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Narrator:
BY ELECTION NIGHT, NIXON AND HUMPHREY WERE DEAD EVEN.
NIXON PREPARED HIS FAMILY
FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF STILL ANOTHER DEFEAT.
Nixon has closed a little bit in the last few tabulations there.
Man:
I THINK BEFORE THE MORNING IS OUT
HUBERT HUMPHREY WILL BE
THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
( cheering )
And there have been no changes.
None of those big states have fallen yet the ones we are waiting for and Nixon has 175...
Narrator:
ALL NIGHT LONG, THE LEAD SHIFTED BACK AND FORTH.
THE RESULTS WEREN'T ANNOUNCED UNTIL 8:00 THE NEXT MORNING.
With 26 electoral votes in Illinois
Richard Nixon goes over the top with 287 electoral votes.
He needed 270 to win and that seems to be the 1968 election.
Announcer:
AND HE IS BEAMING, PAT NIXON IS BEAMING.
ONE CAN'T HELP BUT THINK BACK TO 1960
WHEN A TEARFUL PAT NIXON WAS CHOKING BACK THE EMOTIONS.
IT WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SCENE, OF COURSE, THEN.
HERE IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST FANTASTIC POLITICAL COMEBACKS
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
I SAW MANY SIGNS IN THIS CAMPAIGN.
SOME OF THEM WERE NOT FRIENDLY, SOME WERE VERY FRIENDLY
BUT THE ONE THAT TOUCHED ME THE MOST
WAS ONE THAT I SAW IN DEXTER, OHIO
AT THE END OF A LONG DAY OF WHISTLE-STOPPING.
A TEENAGER HELD UP A SIGN
"BRING US TOGETHER"
AND THAT WILL BE THE GREAT OBJECTIVE
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AT THE OUTSET
TO BRING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TOGETHER.
Narrator:
NIXON SPOKE OF UNITY
BUT HIS MARGIN OF VICTORY HAD BEEN EXTREMELY NARROW.
HE HAD NOT REACHED OUT TO BLACKS
OR THE POOR, OR OPPONENTS OF THE WAR
AND A NATION AS BADLY DIVIDED AS AMERICA IN 1968
WOULD NOT BE EASY TO LEAD.
Chorus:
♫AMERICA♫
♫AMERICA...♫
Narrator:
AT AGE 56, AFTER 22 YEARS OF POLITICAL BATTLE
RICHARD NIXON HAD BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD.
HE ENVISIONED NOTHING LESS THAN A NEW WORLD ORDER
WITH HIMSELF AS ITS ARCHITECT.
THE GREATEST HONOR HISTORY CAN BESTOW
IS THE TITLE OF PEACEMAKER.
THIS HONOR NOW BECKONS AMERICA.
IF WE SUCCEED
GENERATIONS TO COME
WILL SAY OF US NOW LIVING THAT WE MASTERED OUR MOMENT
THAT WE HELPED MAKE THE WORLD SAFE FOR MANKIND.
THIS IS OUR SUMMONS TO GREATNESS.
( marching band music )
Man:
THERE'S NO QUESTION AT ALL THAT NIXON ASPIRED TO GREATNESS.
HE WOULD TALK CONSTANTLY
ABOUT THE GENERATION OF PEACE
THAT HE HOPED TO CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING
THAT WOULD INDEED BE HIS BEQUEST
TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD.
Narrator:
AS NIXON TOOK POWER, HE ASSEMBLED A STAFF
THAT WOULD LEAVE HIM FREE TO CARRY OUT HIS AMBITIOUS PLANS
AND WHOSE LOYALTY HAD ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED.
THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF, AS IT EVOLVES,
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
WILL BE SMALLER THAN IT'S BEEN IN THE PAST...
Narrator:
H.R. HALDEMAN, A FORMER ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE
WHO HAD BEEN AT NIXON'S SIDE SINCE 1956
WAS MADE CHIEF OF STAFF.
"HE WAS PROUD," HE ONCE SAID
"TO BE RICHARD NIXON'S SON OF A BITCH."
JOHN EHRLICHMAN, A LAWYER AND TOP AIDE DURING THE CAMPAIGN
WOULD HANDLE MUCH OF DOMESTIC POLICY.
TOGETHER, HE AND HALDEMAN WOULD TIGHTLY CONTROL ACCESS
TO THE PRESIDENT.
THOSE WHOM THEY EXCLUDED CALLED THEM "THE BERLIN WALL."
BEHIND THAT WALL
NIXON COULD FOCUS ON HIS MAIN INTEREST--
FOREIGN POLICY, BYPASSING THE STATE DEPARTMENT
TO WORK CLOSELY WITH HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
HENRY KISSINGER.
DR. KISSINGER IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MAJOR SCHOLARS
IN AMERICA AND THE WORLD TODAY
IN THIS AREA.
HE HAS NEVER YET HAD A FULL-TIME GOVERNMENT ASSIGNMENT
AND HE WILL BRING TO THIS RESPONSIBILITY A FRESH APPROACH...
Man:
THEY ORGANIZED THE GOVERNMENT TO CONCENTRATE POWER
IN THE HANDS OF THESE TWO MEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND IT'S NOT ACCIDENTAL THAT HE APPOINTS AN OLD FRIEND
BUT A DECIDEDLY WEAK PRACTITIONER IN BILL ROGERS
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
OR ESSENTIALLY A WISCONSIN DELLS POLITICIAN, MELVIN LAIRD
AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE--
THERE ARE NO STRONG FIGURES IN THIS CABINET
AND THERE ARE NO STRONG FOREIGN POLICY FIGURES
ANYWHERE IN THE HIGHER ECHELONS OF THE GOVERNMENT.
IT IS TO BE RICHARD NIXON'S FOREIGN POLICY
AND IT IS TO BE CARRIED OUT
WITH SOPHISTICATION AND SOME SUBTLETY BY HENRY KISSINGER.
Narrator:
LOOMING OVER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION
WAS THE WAR IN VIETNAM.
AMERICAN TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR FOUR YEARS
ON BEHALF OF SOUTH VIETNAM
AGAINST THE SOVIET-BACKED COMMUNIST FORCES OF THE NORTH.
THE WAR HAD ALREADY TAKEN THE LIVES OF 30,000 AMERICANS
AND OVER A MILLION VIETNAMESE, AND DESTROYED ONE PRESIDENT.
NIXON WAS DETERMINED NOT TO LET IT DESTROY HIM.
EVEN BEFORE HIS INAUGURATION
NIXON HAD KISSINGER BEGIN SECRET CONTACTS
WITH THE NORTH VIETNAMESE IN AN ATTEMPT
TO MOVE THE STALLED PARIS PEACE TALKS FORWARD
AND SOON, THE TWO MEN DEVELOPED A STRATEGY
THEY HOPED WOULD GET THE U.S. OUT OF THE WAR
WITHOUT ABANDONING AMERICA'S ALLY, SOUTH VIETNAM.
Nixon:
WE HAVE ADOPTED A PLAN
WHICH WE HAVE WORKED OUT
IN COOPERATION WITH THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE
FOR THE COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL U.S. COMBAT GROUND FORCES
AND THEIR REPLACEMENT BY SOUTH VIETNAMESE FORCES
ON AN ORDERLY, SCHEDULED TIMETABLE.
THIS WITHDRAWAL WILL BE MADE FROM STRENGTH...
Narrator:
CONFIDENT THAT THIS POLICY
WOULD END AMERICA'S INVOLVEMENT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
BY THE END OF 1970
NIXON AND KISSINGER TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO GLOBAL STRATEGY
RESHAPING AMERICA'S ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE COMMUNIST WORLD.
THEY BOTH BEGAN IN 1969-1970 WITH A NOTION
THAT ONLY LATELY HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE IN WASHINGTON
AND THAT IS THAT THE POST-WAR IS REALLY OVER
THAT THE COLD WAR OUGHT TO BE A THING OF THE PAST.
THEY ARE, IN THAT SENSE, ALMOST 20 YEARS AHEAD OF THEIR TIME.
Narrator:
RECOGNIZING THAT THE SOVIET UNION
HAD NEARLY CAUGHT UP TO THE U.S. IN NUCLEAR STRENGTH
NIXON AND KISSINGER DISPATCHED A TEAM OF NEGOTIATORS
TO WORK OUT A TREATY WITH THE SOVIETS.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE NUCLEAR AGE
THE TWO SUPERPOWERS SAT DOWN
TO DISCUSS SETTING LIMITS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY BEGAN SECRET CONTACTS
WITH THE OTHER GREAT COMMUNIST POWER, CHINA.
THERE WERE FEW MORE FORBIDDING
AND ISOLATED PLACES IN THE WORLD IN 1969
BUT NIXON BELIEVED THAT CHINA, WITH ITS VAST POPULATION
AND GROWING NUCLEAR ARSENAL
WOULD SOON BE TOO POWERFUL TO IGNORE.
Morris:
HERE, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 20th CENTURY
WE HAVE TWO MEN AT THE VERY PINNACLE OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
WHO HAVE SOME CLEAR NOTION
NOT ONLY OF WHAT THE WORLD IS DOING OUT THERE
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD
BUT OF WHERE THEY WANT THE UNITED STATES TO FIT IN.
WE ARE NOT A NATION THAT PRACTICES
ITS FOREIGN POLICY BY DESIGN, FOR THE MOST PART
AND NIXON AND KISSINGER ARE AN EXCEPTION TO THAT RULE.
Narrator:
IN THE SUMMER OF 1969, NIXON ANNOUNCED
THE FIRST AMERICAN TROOP WITHDRAWALS FROM VIETNAM.
ARMS CONTROL, CHINA, SOUTHEAST ASIA--
HE SEEMED TO BE MOVING STEADILY TOWARD BECOMING A PEACEMAKER.
Man:
TEN, HUT!
Narrator:
RICHARD NIXON LOVED THE MOVIE PATTON
AND WATCHED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
( bugle salute )
GENERAL GEORGE PATTON WAS A MAN OF ACTION
CONTEMPTUOUS OF HIS CRITICS, UNCOMPROMISING
DETERMINED TO WIN AT ALL COSTS.
BE SEATED.
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER--
AMERICANS LOVE A WINNER
AND WILL NOT TOLERATE A LOSER.
AMERICANS PLAY TO WIN ALL THE TIME.
I WOULDN'T GIVE A HOOT IN HELL FOR A MAN WHO LOST AND LAUGHED.
THAT'S WHY AMERICANS HAVE NEVER LOST
AND WILL NEVER LOSE A WAR
BECAUSE THE VERY THOUGHT OF LOSING IS HATEFUL TO AMERICANS.
Narrator:
RICHARD NIXON WAS DETERMINED
NOT TO BE THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO LOSE A WAR.
HE MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE BROUGHT THE TROOPS HOME
AND BLAMED VIETNAM ON THE DEMOCRATS
BUT NIXON, LIKE MANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN BOTH PARTIES
BELIEVED THAT ABANDONING SOUTH VIETNAM TO THE COMMUNISTS
WOULD BE A DEFEAT THAT INVITED FURTHER AGGRESSION--
A SIGN THAT AMERICA COULD NO LONGER BE COUNTED ON
BY HER ALLIES.
DESPITE MOUNTING PRESSURE FOR IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL
HE STUCK TO HIS GRADUAL COURSE
WHILE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WHAT HE CALLED
"AN HONORABLE END TO THE WAR."
BUT THE MONTHS DRAGGED ON.
CASUALTIES MOUNTED
AND NIXON'S POLICY SEEMED ONLY TO PROLONG AMERICA'S AGONY.
I SAID, "WITH RESPECT TO VIETNAM--
I SAID, "THE WAR IN VIETNAM IS LOST
AND THE SOONER YOU GET OUT, THE BETTER WE WILL BE."
IT WAS LOST, BUT HE, FOR SOME REASON, KEPT AT IT.
IT WASN'T HIS WAR
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT JUST IN HANDLING A PRESIDENCY
YOU STICK AROUND WITH THE WAR FOR TWO YEARS
AND IT'S YOUR WAR, AND IT BECAME HIS WAR.
AND IN THE END
HALF THE COUNTRY SEEMED TO THINK HE STARTED IT.
Crowd:
♫ALL WE ARE SAYING♫
♫IS GIVE PEACE A CHANCE...♫
Narrator:
IN OCTOBER 1969
THE LARGEST ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS
IN THE NATION'S HISTORY
COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS "THE MORATORIUM"
WERE HELD IN CITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
CRITICS OF THE WAR HAD WAITED NINE MONTHS
FOR NIXON TO MAKE GOOD HIS PLEDGE TO END THE CONFLICT
BUT NOW THE HONEYMOON WAS OVER.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE
OPPOSITION TO THE WAR IN VIETNAM
ON THE CAMPUSES AND ALSO IN THE NATION.
AS FAR AS THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY IS CONCERNED
WE EXPECT IT, HOWEVER, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WILL I BE AFFECTED WHATEVER BY IT.
THE MORATORIUM ITSELF WAS SEEN BY RICHARD NIXON
AS 200,000 PEOPLE OUT THERE ON THE MALL
PROTESTING HIS FOREIGN POLICY
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE POLLS WERE SHOWING
THAT 58%-59% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORTED HIM
IN HIS FOREIGN POLICY.
AND HE WOULD LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND HE WOULD SAY
"I SIMPLY CANNOT PERMIT FOREIGN POLICY TO BE MADE
IN THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON."
Man:
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID
NOTHING YOU YOUNG KIDS WOULD DO WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON HIM.
WELL, I SUGGEST TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
IF HE WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EFFECT
YOU YOUNGSTERS CAN HAVE ON THE PRESIDENT
HE SHOULD MAKE ONE LONG-DISTANCE PHONE CALL
TO THE L.B.J. RANCH
AND ASK THAT BOY HOW MUCH EFFECT YOU CAN HAVE.
( cheering )
Crowd:
1-2-3-4, TRICKY DICK STOP THE WAR.
Narrator:
THE FATE OF LYNDON JOHNSON DID HAUNT RICHARD NIXON.
HE FELT HE HAD TO DEMONSTRATE
THAT MOST AMERICANS STILL SUPPORTED HIM
AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BENEFIT HANOI
TO STALL PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.
"DON'T GET RATTLED, DON'T WAVER, DON'T REACT"
HE TOLD HIMSELF AS HE WENT TO WORK ON A SPEECH
TO RESPOND TO THE PROTESTS.
INSISTING ON WRITING IT HIMSELF
HE DISTINGUISHED HIS SUPPORTERS, THE "FORGOTTEN AMERICANS"
FROM THE VOCAL MINORITY IN THE STREETS
WITH A NEW CATCHPHRASE:
...TO YOU, THE GREAT SILENT MAJORITY OF MY FELLOW AMERICANS
I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
FOR THE MORE DIVIDED WE ARE AT HOME
THE LESS LIKELY THE ENEMY IS TO NEGOTIATE AT PARIS.
LET US BE UNITED FOR PEACE.
LET US ALSO BE UNITED AGAINST DEFEAT.
BECAUSE LET US UNDERSTAND:
NORTH VIETNAM CANNOT DEFEAT OR HUMILIATE THE UNITED STATES.
ONLY AMERICANS CAN DO THAT.
Narrator:
IT WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE SPEECH OF NIXON'S PRESIDENCY.
80,000 TELEGRAMS AND LETTERS ARRIVED AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
NEARLY ALL SUPPORTED HIM.
HIS APPROVAL RATING SOARED.
BUT THE WAR CONTINUED, AND WITH IT THE PROTESTS.
Morris:
RICHARD NIXON CAME TO OFFICE EXPECTING
IF NOT A QUICK FIX IN VIETNAM
EXPECTING A KIND OF RESPONSIVENESS IN THE WAR.
HE HAD MADE CERTAIN SPEECHES.
HE HAD OFFERED CERTAIN GESTURES.
HE HAD PROFFERED BOTH SECRETLY AND PUBLICLY
WHAT HE THOUGHT WERE PROMISING INITIATIVES IN NEGOTIATIONS.
NONE OF THAT HAD YIELDED ANYTHING.
THERE WAS A PALPABLE SENSE OF FRUSTRATION
IN THE ADMINISTRATION
ABOUT HOW LONG THIS WAR WAS GOING TO DRAG ON.
OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE BEGAN TO FLOOD MEMORANDA
THAT WERE STREAM- OF-CONSCIOUSNESS
RENDITIONS OF THE PRESIDENT'S
FEARS AND AMBITIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA--
HIS IMAGE OF THIS WHOLE CONTEST
AS A KIND OF CHALLENGE BEING ISSUED
NOT ONLY BY THE PARTIES ON THE GROUND
BY THE CAMBODIAN REBELS,
THE NORTH VIETNAMESE, AND THE VIET CONG
BUT ULTIMATELY BY MORE FORMIDABLE AND DISTANT FORCES
THE SOVIET UNION, BY CHINA, BY HIS ENEMIES TESTING HIM
MEASURING HIS METTLE AS A MAN AND AS A LEADER.
Ehrlichman:
HE TOOK ME ASIDE AND HE SAID
"I'M GOING TO BE OUT OF THE PLAY FOR TEN DAYS.
"I WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE
"ANY DOMESTIC DECISIONS FOR TEN DAYS
"SO COME BACK THIS AFTERNOON AND TELL ME ALL THE THINGS
"THAT NEED TO BE DECIDED FOR THE NEXT TEN DAYS
"AND THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU
"BECAUSE I'LL BE FOCUSING ON THIS BUSINESS IN VIETNAM.
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND BRING IT TO A HEAD."
Narrator:
AT THE PENTAGON, DEFENSE SECRETARY LAIRD
WAITED FOR THE PRESIDENT.
AFTER DAYS OF TENSE DELIBERATION
NIXON WAS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE AN ATTACK ON ENEMY SANCTUARIES
ACROSS THE VIETNAM BORDER IN CAMBODIA
AND THE WOULD DO SO OVER THE OBJECTIONS
OF MANY WHITE HOUSE ADVISORS.
Morris:
WE THOUGHT THE INVASION WAS A BAD IDEA
AND THAT IT WAS ONE MORE ROUND OF ESCALATION
ON THE PATTERN...
ON AN OLD PATTERN IN VIETNAM
WHICH WOULD COST LIVES AND NATIONAL TREASURE
AND REALLY ONLY PROLONG THE SUFFERING
AND DO NOTHING TO AFFECT THE LARGER OUTCOME OF THE WAR.
Narrator:
BUT THE MILITARY AND KISSINGER RECOMMENDED THE ACTION
AND NIXON WANTED TO GO AHEAD.
HE WAS CONVINCED THAT DESTROYING
THE NORTH VIETNAMESE HIDING PLACES IN CAMBODIA
WOULD RELIEVE COMMUNIST PRESSURE ON THE SOUTH
AND HE WANTED TO TAKE SOME DRAMATIC ACTION TO DEMONSTRATE
THAT NEITHER HANOI NOR THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT
COULD INTIMIDATE THE UNITED STATES OR ITS PRESIDENT.
IF, WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN, THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL NATION
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ACTS LIKE A PITIFUL, HELPLESS GIANT
THE FORCES OF TOTALITARIANISM AND ANARCHY
WILL THREATEN FREE NATIONS AND FREE INSTITUTIONS
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
IT IS NOT OUR POWER BUT OUR WILL AND CHARACTER
THAT IS BEING TESTED TONIGHT.
Narrator:
AS NIXON SPOKE, AMERICAN TROOPS MOVED INTO CAMBODIA.
HIS CRITICS WERE OUTRAGED.
THE PRESIDENT WHO HAD PROMISED TO END THE WAR
SEEMED TO BE WIDENING IT
MOVING INTO A COUNTRY PERCEIVED AS NEUTRAL.
THREE MEMBERS OF KISSINGER'S STAFF, INCLUDING ROGER MORRIS
RESIGNED IN PROTEST.
NIXON WAS UNMOVED.
Nixon:
I WOULD RATHER BE
A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT AND DO WHAT I BELIEVE WAS RIGHT
THAN TO BE A TWO-TERM PRESIDENT
AT THE COST OF SEEING AMERICA BECOME A SECOND-RATE POWER
AND TO SEE THIS NATION ACCEPT THE FIRST DEFEAT
IN ITS PROUD 190-YEAR HISTORY.
Narrator:
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
NIXON WENT TO THE PENTAGON FOR A FIRSTHAND BRIEFING.
THE MILITARY WAS REPORTING SUCCESS.
NIXON WAS ENCOURAGED, AND PRAISED AMERICAN SOLDIERS
FIGHTING IN THE JUNGLES OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.
THE WIFE OF ONE OF THOSE SOLDIERS
REACHED OUT TO SHAKE HIS HAND.
NIXON DREW A SHARP CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TROOPS IN VIETNAM
AND THE STUDENT PROTESTERS AT HOME.
Nixon:
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THESE BUMS,
YOU KNOW, BLOWING UP THE CAMPUSES.
LISTEN, THE BOYS THAT ARE ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES TODAY
ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
AND HERE THEY ARE, BURNING UP THE BOOKS
I MEAN, STORMING AROUND ABOUT THIS ISSUE--
I MEAN, YOU NAME IT.
GET RID OF THE WAR, THERE'LL BE ANOTHER ONE... ( siren howling )
Narrator:
NIXON'S REMARKS FURTHER INFURIATED STUDENTS
ALREADY PROTESTING OVER CAMBODIA.
AFTER THREE TENSE DAYS OF DEMONSTRATIONS
AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY IN OHIO
NERVOUS NATIONAL GUARDSMEN OPENED FIRE.
( crackle of gunshots )
FOUR STUDENTS WERE KILLED.
"MY CHILD WAS NOT A BUM," SAID THE FATHER OF ONE DEAD GIRL.
AMERICAN CAMPUSES EXPLODED.
HUNDREDS OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CLOSED DOWN.
GOVERNORS IN 16 STATES CALLED OUT THE POLICE
AND NATIONAL GUARD.
NIXON'S SUPPORTERS TOOK TO THE STREETS AS WELL.
AT NEW YORK'S CITY HALL, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS STRUGGLED
TO RAISE THE FLAG WHICH THE MAYOR HAD LOWERED
TO HONOR THE DEAD AT KENT STATE.
NIXON'S MOVE INTO CAMBODIA AND HIS DIVIDING OF AMERICANS
INTO "BUMS" AND "HEROES" HAD SET OFF A NATIONAL FIRESTORM.
Crowd:
STRIKE!
STRIKE!
STRIKE!
Narrator:
ANGRY PROTESTORS RETURNED TO WASHINGTON.
AS TENSIONS ROSE, THE SECRET SERVICE RINGED THE WHITE HOUSE
WITH A BARRICADE OF BUSES.
Man:
IT WAS LIKE LIVING IN A BUNKER IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU'D LOOK OUT IN THE STREETS
AND SEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PROTESTING.
YOU LITERALLY WERE AFRAID FOR YOUR LIFE.
THERE WERE TIME WHEN I CAN REMEMBER SAYING
"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
"A FREE COUNTRY.
"HERE WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH BARRICADES UP
"AND BUSES AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE
"AND TEAR GAS GOING OF
"AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS OUT IN THE STREETS
AND TROOPS SITTING HERE."
Narrator:
AN EMBATTLED NIXON FACED THE PRESS AS ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATORS
CONTINUED TO FLOCK TO WASHINGTON.
Journalist:
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STUDENTS
ARE TRYING TO SAY WITH THESE DEMONSTRATIONS?
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT THEY WANT PEACE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO STOP THE KILLING.
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO END THE DRAFT.
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF VIETNAM.
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.
I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE DECISIONS THAT I HAVE MADE
WILL SERVE THAT PURPOSE.
Crowd:
♫ALL WE ARE SAYING♫
♫IS GIVE PEACE A CHANCE♫
Narrator:
THAT NIGHT, PROTESTORS CIRCLED THE WHITE HOUSE
WITH CHANTS AND CANDLES.
INSIDE, A SLEEPLESS NIXON MADE MORE THAN 40 PHONE CALLS
TO FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY.
NEAR DAWN, HE CALLED FOR A CAR AND ASKED TO BE DRIVEN
TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL WHERE PROTESTORS HAD GATHERED.
WHITE HOUSE AIDE, EGIL KROGH FOLLOWED HIM.
IT WAS...
I GUESS IT WAS ALMOST A SURREAL ATMOSPHERE.
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE DREAMLIKE.
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?
WALKING UP THE STAIRS OF THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL
AND THERE WAS THE PRESIDENT
SORT OF STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE
WHO WERE WEARING COMBAT FATIGUES
WITH PEACE SYMBOLS, AND BANDANNAS--
ALL OF THE CLOTHING OF THE '60s AND THE '70s
AND TRYING VERY HARD TO...
TO COMMUNICATE TO THEM.
I THINK I SAID, "WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
"ABOUT THE KENT STATE KILLINGS?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE WAR?"
HE SAID, "I'M REALLY NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE TRYING TO HANDLE THINGS."
SO IT WAS A ONE-WAY, YOU KNOW, CONVERSATION OR A ONE-WAY STREET
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE WAS THERE
TRYING TO BE VERY CONVERSATIONAL AND CASUAL
AND WE WERE THERE OUTRAGED AND ANGRY AND SCARED.
Krogh:
ONE STUDENT BASICALLY TOLD HIM
SAID, "I HOPE THAT YOU REALIZE
THAT WE ARE WILLING TO DIE FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN."
AND I THINK...
AS I RECALL, THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE WAS
"WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A WORLD
WHERE PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE TO DIE FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN."
Choir:
♫OH, HOW I LOVE JESUS♫
♫OH, HOW I LOVE JESUS♫
Singer:
IF YOU LOVE HIM, SING!
♫OH, HOW I LOVE JESUS♫
Singer:
♫TO KNOW THAT JESUS...♫
SWEET, LOVING MERCIFUL JESUS IS OURS.
HE BELONGS TO ALL OF US WHO WANT TO RECEIVE AND ACCEPT HIM.
( loud applause )
Narrator:
WHEN HE APPEARED AS THE GUEST OF HONOR
AT A BILLY GRAHAM CRUSADE IN TENNESSEE
NIXON HAD BEEN IN OFFICE 16 MONTHS.
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS STILL BACKED HIS VIETNAM POLICY
BUT THE FUROR OVER CAMBODIA HAD DEEPENED THE DIVISIONS
NIXON HAD PROMISED TO MEND.
EVEN HERE, SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS WHO SUPPORTED HIM
THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT ESCAPE THE CEASELESS STORM OF PROTEST.
( shouting and booing )
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER
AS WE MUST BRING THEM TOGETHER
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEACE IN THE WORLD
IF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE A FULFILLMENT
BEYOND SIMPLY THOSE MATERIAL THINGS
THEY MUST TURN TO THOSE GREAT SPIRITUAL SOURCES
THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA THE GREAT COUNTRY THAT IT IS.
I'M PROUD TO BE HERE
AND I'M VERY PROUD TO HAVE YOUR WARM RECEPTION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
( applause )
Man:
LET US SING TOGETHER
"GOD BLESS AMERICA, MY HOME, SWEET HOME."
♫GOD BLESS AMERICA, LAND THAT I LOVE♫
♫STAND BESIDE HER, AND GUIDE...♫
Narrator:
THROUGHOUT THE NEXT YEAR
NIXON CONTINUED TO TRY TO RALLY HIS SUPPORTERS
WHILE DENOUNCING HIS OPPONENTS
CALLING SOME AMONG THE PROTESTERS
"THUGS" AND "HOODLUMS"
BLAMING HIS CRITICS IN CONGRESS AND THE PRESS
FOR FAILING TO SUPPORT THE WAR.
♫GOD BLESS AMERICA...♫
Narrator:
ALL U.S. TROOPS LEFT CAMBODIA BY THE END OF JUNE
AS NIXON HAD PROMISED.
HE INSISTED THAT THE MILITARY ACTION
WHICH HAD CAUSED SUCH TURMOIL
HAD EASED THE PRESSURE ON THE TROOPS IN VIETNAM.
WITHDRAWALS CONTINUED ON SCHEDULE
BUT MORE AMERICAN LIVES HAD BEEN LOST.
THERE WAS NO BREAKTHROUGH IN THE PEACE TALKS.
AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE
AN INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AND SUSPICIOUS NIXON URGED
INTENSIFIED SURVEILLANCE OF THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT.
HE GREW DISTRUSTFUL EVEN OF HIS CLOSEST ADVISORS
AND INSTALLED HIDDEN MICROPHONES IN HIS OWN OFFICE
IN PART, SO THAT HIS AIDES COULD NOT LATER CLAIM
TO HAVE DISAGREED WITH HIS DECISIONS.
BUT THE TAPING SYSTEM WOULD EVENTUALLY TRAP
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.
Narrator:
ON JUNE 12, 1971, THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF
PREPARED FOR A WEDDING IN THE ROSE GARDEN.
THE PRESIDENT'S ELDER DAUGHTER, TRICIA, WAS TO BE MARRIED
TO A YOUNG LAW STUDENT, EDWARD COX.
RAIN THREATENED THE CEREMONY.
NIXON SPENT MUCH OF THE AFTERNOON ON THE PHONE
TO AIR FORCE WEATHERMEN.
FINALLY, THERE WAS A PREDICTION
OF A 15-MINUTE BREAK IN THE WEATHER.
I GOT TO GET DRESSED!
I'VE GOT TO GET ALL MY THINGS-- MY HAIR DONE.
( laughter )
Man:
I SAW THE PRESIDENT MORE RELAXED
MORE HAPPY AND MORE LIKE A TYPICAL AMERICAN FATHER
THAN I'VE SEEN HIM IN A LONG, LONG TIME.
Interviewer:
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DOING
A GREAT JOB OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR TOO.
YES...
AND HE DOESN'T DANCE ALL THAT OFTEN, YOU KNOW.
Narrator:
"IT WAS A DAY THAT ALL OF US WILL REMEMBER"
NIXON LATER WROTE
"BECAUSE WE WERE BEAUTIFULLY AND SIMPLY HAPPY."
THE NEXT MORNING, NIXON PICKED UP THE NEW YORK TIMES.
IN THE LEFT CORNER WAS AN ACCOUNT OF TRICIA'S WEDDING.
ACROSS THE PAGE WAS ANOTHER HEADLINE:
THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF WHAT CAME TO BE CALLED
THE PENTAGON PAPERS, A SECRET DEFENSE DEPARTMENT STUDY
WHICH REVEALED PAST GOVERNMENT DECEPTION
ABOUT THE WAR IN VIETNAM.
I FELT AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN...
Narrator:
DANIEL ELLSBERG, A FORMER DEFENSE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE
WHO HAD TURNED AGAINST THE WAR
HAD GIVEN THE TOP-SECRET DOCUMENTS TO THE PRESS.
I COULD NO LONGER COOPERATE WITH CONCEALING THIS INFORMATION
FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
Narrator:
ALTHOUGH THE PENTAGON PAPERS CONTAINED NOTHING
ABOUT THE NIXON POLICY IN VIETNAM
IT WAS A LEAK OF ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE.
THE PRESIDENT AND HENRY KISSINGER SAW IT
AS A DISTURBING PRECEDENT
AND A THREAT TO THEIR SECRET DIPLOMACY.
Colson:
THERE WAS PANIC IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND I REMEMBER BEING IN MEETINGS WITH HENRY KISSINGER THAT DAY
IN WHICH HE SAID "THIS COULD CAUSE THE COLLAPSE
"OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY
"AND THIS COULD UNDERMINE OUR INITIATIVES
WITH CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION."
AND DON'T FORGET, AT THAT TIME PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW
THAT WE WERE NEGOTIATING SECRETLY WITH THE CHINESE.
THEY DID NOT ALSO KNOW THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING
SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE NORTH VIETNAMESE
TO END THE WAR IN VIETNAM.
AND SO A LOT OF THINGS WERE GOING ON THAT WE KNEW
THAT THE PUBLIC DIDN'T.
Narrator:
JUST FIVE WEEKS LATER, THE TIMES PUBLISHED ANOTHER LEAK
THIS ONE POTENTIALLY DAMAGING TO NIXON'S FOREIGN POLICY.
IT REVEALED U.S. NEGOTIATING TACTICS
AND UPCOMING ARMS TALKS WITH THE SOVIETS
AND IT SEEMED TO CONFIRM NIXON'S WORST FEARS ABOUT THE PRESS.
Krogh:
I HAD SEEN HIM ANGRY IN MEETINGS IN THE PAST
BUT I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF FURY
WHERE HE WAS BASICALLY WALKING AROUND THE ROOM
SLAMMING HIS FIST IN HIS HANDS
SAYING THAT THIS CANNOT BE TOLERATED.
WE CANNOT LET THIS GO ON!
Colson:
NIXON BECAME OBSESSIVE ABOUT THE PRESS COVERAGE.
WE HAD A DAILY NEWS SUMMARY THAT WAS PREPARED
BY A YOUNG MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE
AND BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE WHITE HOUSE
THE PRESIDENT HAD ALREADY READ IT AND HAD MARKED ON THE COLUMNS
"JOHN CHANCELLOR LAST NIGHT SAID THIS, RESPOND TODAY."
"CALL UP SO-AND-SO."
"LOOK AT THIS-- YOU CAN'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE."
"NEWSWEEK HAS DONE IT TO US AGAIN."
I'D GET NIXON'S NEWS SUMMARY
WITH ALL THESE COMMENTS DOWN THE SIDE
AND SO YOU HAD THE IDEA,
WHEN YOU WENT TO WORK IN THE MORNING
YOU WERE GOING TO WAR WITH THE PRESS.
Narrator:
A SENSE OF BEING UNDER SEIGE PERVADED THE WHITE HOUSE
FUELED BY THE LEAKS, THE CONSTANT ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS
AND INTENSIFYING CRITICISM IN THE PRESS.
IN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF "US VERSUS THEM"
COLSON'S OFFICE BEGAN AN EVER-EXPANDING LIST
OF NIXON'S CRITICS-- "THE ENEMIES LIST."
ITS OBJECT WAS "TO SCREW OUR POLITICAL ENEMIES."
REPORTERS AND POLITICIANS, EDUCATORS AND ENTERTAINERS
WERE BARRED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
SOME WERE TARGETED FOR TAX AUDITS
OTHERS WERE TRAILED BY PRIVATE DETECTIVES.
Colson:
AND IT WAS VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER
THAT NIXON AUTHORIZED THE PLUMBERS--
THE CREATION OF A SPECIAL GROUP TO STOP LEAKS
AND THEY BEGAN
TO TAKE EXTRALEGAL STEPS AND PUT INTO MOTION THE MECHANISM
WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE DOWNFALL OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
Narrator:
IN A WHITE HOUSE MEMO
REGARDING THE NEUTRALIZATION OF DANIEL ELLSBERG
THE PLUMBERS DISCUSSED HOW THEY MIGHT
"DESTROY HIS PUBLIC IMAGE AND CREDIBILITY."
IN SEARCH OF DAMAGING INFORMATION
ABOUT ELLSBERG'S PRIVATE LIFE
THEY ARRANGED A BREAK-IN AT THE OFFICE OF HIS PSYCHIATRIST.
Krogh:
THEY APPARENTLY BROKE A WINDOW
ON THE WAY IN.
AND REALIZING THAT IT COULD NO LONGER BE VIEWED
AS A COVERT OPERATION
CHANGED COURSES AND DECIDED TO MAKE IT LOOK
AS IF IT HAD BEEN ENTERED BY A BURGLAR
LOOKING FOR DRUGS OR SOME OTHER SUBSTANCES.
BASICALLY, THEY SMASHED UP THE OFFICE
TOOK PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE.
I WAS SHOCKED AT THESE PICTURES.
WENT TO SEE JOHN EHRLICHMAN.
HE WAS, IF ANYTHING, MORE SHOCKED THAN I WAS
AND SAID, "SHUT IT DOWN AS OF NOW."
Narrator:
THE PLUMBERS WERE EVENTUALLY DISBANDED
BUT SOME OF THE AGENTS WERE REASSIGNED
TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES
FOR THE NEWLY-FORMED COMMITTEE TO REELECT THE PRESIDENT.
REELECTION HAD BECOME NIXON'S CONSUMING CONCERN.
FROM THE FIRST DAY OF HIS PRESIDENCY
HE HAD FOUGHT TO HOLD ON TO HIS "SILENT MAJORITY"
AND HAD SHAPED HIS DOMESTIC POLICIES
IN PART TO WIN THEIR VOTES.
BUT THOSE VOTERS WERE SLIPPING AWAY.
UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION WERE UP.
RACIAL DIVISIONS HAD DEEPENED
AND STILL, WEEK AFTER WEEK, THE DEAD CAME HOME FROM VIETNAM.
NIXON'S POPULARITY HAD FALLEN SO LOW THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO FEAR
HE WOULD NOT EVEN BE RENOMINATED IN 1972.
Announcer:
GOOD EVENING.
THE 37th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
RICHARD M. NIXON, IS IN CHINA--
THE FIRST AMERICAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE
EVER TO VISIT THE WORLD'S MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY.
( band playing "The Star-spangled Banner" )
( crowd cheering )
Narrator:
ON FEBRUARY 18, 1972
RICHARD NIXON BEGAN STILL ANOTHER REMARKABLE COMEBACK
WITH A STUNNING FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESS.
Reporter:
PRESIDENT NIXON'S MOTORCADE
IS NOW SWEEPING TOWARD THE CITY OF PEKING.
Reporter:
HERE COMES THE MOTORCADE NOW, AS YOU SEE.
Narrator:
THE WORLD WATCHED AS RICHARD NIXON DROVE THROUGH A CITY
THAT FEW OUTSIDERS HAD SEEN FOR NEARLY A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.
"HE KNEW," SAID THE NEW YORK TIMES
"THAT FOR THIS JOURNEY, NO MATTER WHAT ELSE OCCURRED
HE WOULD ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED."
THAT AFTERNOON, NIXON WAS ABRUPTLY SUMMONED
TO SEE MAO TSE-TUNG.
AMERICAN TELEVISION WAS UNAWARE OF THE MEETING.
THE ONLY COVERAGE WAS BY CHINESE CAMERAMEN
WITH BLACK AND WHITE FILM.
THIS ENCOUNTER BETWEEN NIXON, THE CAREER ANTI-COMMUNIST
AND CHAIRMAN MAO, THE LEADER OF THE LARGEST
COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN HISTORY
SHOCKED NIXON'S OLD CONSERVATIVE ALLIES.
THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SURRENDERING TO INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.
BUT FOR NIXON, IT WAS ALL PART OF HIS GLOBAL STRATEGY.
BY VISITING CHINA, HE WAS BEGINNING TO EXPLOIT
THE DIVISIONS IN THE COMMUNIST WORLD.
Man:
ONE OF NIXON'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
IN OPENING UP WITH CHINA
WAS TO GIVE HIM MORE LEVERAGE WITH THE SOVIET UNION.
THESE RELATIONS WERE ESSENTIALLY STALLED
BUT SOON AFTER THE OPENING WITH CHINA
THE SOVIET UNION BECAME MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE ON SEVERAL FRONTS.
THEY AGREED TO A SUMMIT MEETING WITH US IN 1972
AND THEY BEGAN TO BE MORE REASONABLE
ON VARIOUS ARMS CONTROL ISSUES.
( dramatic opera singing )
Colson:
NIXON ENJOYED THE POWER GAME
PROBABLY AS MUCH AS ANY PRESIDENT IN MODERN TIMES.
HE PLAYED IT VERY HARD AND VERY CLEVERLY
AND VERY CAREFULLY IN THE WORLD SCENE.
HE WAS ALWAYS THINKING STRATEGICALLY--
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE QUALITIES
THAT SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE IN FOREIGN POLICY
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT MAKE DECISIONS IN FOREIGN POLICY
BASED ON TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCE.
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT ITS RAMIFICATIONS
FOR FIVE, TEN, 15, 20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD
IT'S LIKE A CHESS PLAYER:
YOU'RE ANTICIPATING SIX MOVES AHEAD
IF YOU'RE A GOOD CHESS PLAYER.
Group:
♫WE LOVE YOU, PRESIDENT♫
♫OH, YES WE DO♫
♫WE LOVE YOU, PRESIDENT, AND WE'LL BE TRUE♫
♫WHEN YOU'RE NOT NEAR US, WE'RE BLUE♫
♫OH, PRESIDENT, WE LOVE YOU.♫
( helicopter engine humming )
Narrator:
IN THE SPRING OF 1972
THE NORTH VIETNAMESE SUDDENLY LAUNCHED A MASSIVE OFFENSIVE.
SOUTH VIETNAM'S FORCES WERE OVERWHELMED.
THOUSANDS FLED.
IF THE OFFENSIVE WERE NOT STOPPED, THE WAR WOULD BE LOST
AND WITH IT, NIXON FEARED, THE PRESIDENCY.
BUT IF HE ORDERED A U.S. COUNTERATTACK
THE SOVIETS MIGHT CANCEL
THE UPCOMING ARMS CONTROL SUMMIT IN MOSCOW--
A VITAL PART OF NIXON'S GRAND DESIGN.
MOST OF HIS ADVISORS URGED NIXON NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTION
THAT MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE SUMMIT.
ONCE AGAIN, NIXON OVERRULED THEM.
HIS VIEW WAS THAT IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING
FOR HIM TO GO TO MOSCOW
WITHOUT RESPONDING TO NORTH VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION.
HE WOULD LOOK WEAK.
HE'S TALKING TO SOVIET LEADERS
WHO ARE PROVIDING ARMS TO THE NORTH VIETNAMESE TROOPS
WHO ARE KILLING AMERICAN TROOPS.
SO HE DIDN'T THINK THE SUMMIT WAS WORTH IT
UNLESS HE COULD ALSO SHOW THAT HE WAS STRONG
WITHIN VIETNAM ITSELF.
Narrator:
NIXON ORDERED THE MOST DRASTIC ESCALATION
OF THE WAR SINCE 1968--
MASSIVE, SUSTAINED BOMBING OF HANOI
AND THE MINING OF HAIPHONG HARBOR
RISKING A FULL-SCALE CONFRONTATION WITH THE SOVIETS
BY PUTTING THEIR SUPPLY SHIPS IN PERIL.
AFTER EXPLAINING HIS DECISION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HE MADE A DIRECT APPEAL TO THE KREMLIN.
OUR TWO NATIONS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS IN RECENT MONTHS.
WE ARE NEAR MAJOR AGREEMENTS ON NUCLEAR ARMS LIMITATION
ON TRADE, ON A HOST OF OTHER ISSUES.
LET US NOT SLIDE BACK TOWARD THE DARK SHADOWS
OF A PREVIOUS AGE.
WE DO NOT ASK YOU TO SACRIFICE YOUR PRINCIPLES OR YOUR FRIENDS
BUT NEITHER SHOULD YOU PERMIT HANOI'S INTRANSIGENCE
TO BLOT OUT THE PROSPECTS
WE TOGETHER HAVE SO PATIENTLY PREPARED.
( American anthem being played )
Narrator:
NIXON'S GAMBLE PAID OFF.
THE SOVIETS DID NOT CANCEL THE SUMMIT.
ON MAY 22, 1972
RICHARD NIXON BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT
EVER TO SET FOOT INSIDE THE KREMLIN.
NIXON HAD DONE WHAT NONE OF HIS PREDECESSORS
HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO.
HE HAD NEGOTIATED A TREATY
IN WHICH THE TWO SUPERPOWERS AGREED TO SLOW AN ARMS RACE
THAT HAD BEEN ACCELERATING
FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.
IT WAS HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT.
TWO DAYS LATER, FIVE BURGLARS
WORKING FOR THE COMMITTEE TO REELECT RICHARD NIXON
ENTERED THE WATERGATE COMPLEX IN WASHINGTON.
THEY BROKE INTO THE OFFICE
OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE
PLACED BUGS ON THE TELEPHONES AND MADE THEIR ESCAPE.
BUT THE MICROPHONES FAILED TO WORK.
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Narrator:
NIXON RETURNED FROM MOSCOW IN TRIUMPH.
HE HAD ALMOST COMPLETED THE WITHDRAWAL
OF AMERICAN FORCES FROM VIETNAM, OPENED THE DOOR TO CHINA
AND SIGNED THE FIRST NUCLEAR ARMS LIMITATION TREATY
SINCE THE DAWN OF THE ATOMIC AGE.
HE HAD OFTEN SAID THAT ALL HE WANTED WAS A LIFE
WITH ONE MORE VICTORY THAN DEFEAT.
NOW THAT VICTORY-- A SECOND TERM AS PRESIDENT--
SEEMED HIS FOR THE ASKING.
Reporter:
FIVE MEN WEARING WHITE GLOVES AND CARRYING CAMERAS
WERE CAUGHT EARLY TODAY IN THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE IN WASHINGTON.
THEY APPARENTLY WERE UNARMED
AND NOBODY KNOWS YET WHY THEY WERE THERE
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE LAST
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR OF THIS STORY.
FIVE MEN WEARING WHITE GLOVES AND CARRYING CAMERAS
WERE CAUGHT EARLY TODAY IN THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE IN WASHINGTON.
THEY WERE CAUGHT BY A NIGHT WATCHMAN,
AND THEY DID NOT RESIST ARREST WHEN THE POLICE CAME.
THEY APPARENTLY WERE UNARMED
AND NOBODY KNOWS YET WHY THEY WERE THERE.
THE FILM IN THE CAMERA HADN'T EVEN BEEN EXPOSED.
IN ANY CASE THEY'RE BEING HELD.
Narrator:
"ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 18," RICHARD NIXON LATER WROTE,
"I LEFT FOR KEY BISCAYNE.
"WHEN I GOT TO MY HOUSE,
"I COULD SMELL COFFEE BREWING IN THE KITCHEN
"AND I WENT IN TO GET A CUP.
"THERE WAS A MIAMI HERALD ON THE COUNTER
"AND I GLANCED OVER THE FRONT PAGE.
"THE MAIN HEADLINE WAS ABOUT THE VIETNAM WITHDRAWALS.
"THERE WAS A SMALL STORY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE..."
Announcer:
THE WATERGATE APARTMENT-HOTEL- OFFICE COMPLEX IN WASHINGTON
HAS A FORTRESS-LIKE APPEARANCE, BUT THE BURGLARS PENETRATED...
Announcer:
FOUR OF THE MEN ARRESTED
WERE CUBAN NATIONALS NOW LIVING IN MIAMI
AND THE FIFTH, JAMES McCORD, WAS A FORMER F.B.I. AND C.I.A. AGENT
RECENTLY EMPLOYED AS A SECURITY AIDE
BY THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
AND THE COMMITTEE TO REELECT THE PRESIDENT.
PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SECRETARY RON ZEIGLER
TODAY CALLED THE INCIDENT A "THIRD-RATE BURGLARY
AND NOTHING THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE CONCERNED WITH."
Narrator:
BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS CONCERNED.
ON JUNE 23, HE MET WITH HIS CHIEF OF STAFF, H.R. HALDEMAN.
( audio recording playing )
Narrator:
TO THWART THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION,
HALDEMAN SUGGESTED THAT THE BREAK-IN COULD BE MADE
TO LOOK LIKE A C.I.A. OPERATION.
Narrator:
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT NIXON HAD ORDERED THE BREAK-IN,
BUT HIS AIDES HAD.
THE PRESIDENT APPROVED THE PLAN TO DIVERT THE F.B.I.
Narrator:
"I SAW WATERGATE AS POLITICS, PURE AND SIMPLE,"
NIXON WROTE IN HIS MEMOIRS.
"WE WERE GOING TO PLAY IT TOUGH.
"I NEVER DOUBTED THAT WAS EXACTLY
HOW THE OTHER SIDE WOULD HAVE PLAYED IT."
Man:
RICHARD NIXON PULLED IT INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE COULDN'T LEAVE IT ALONE.
AND SO WITHIN A WEEK AFTER THE BREAK-IN,
OR MAYBE TWO WEEKS, HE HAD PERSONALLY INVOLVED HIMSELF
IN THE INTRIGUE OF THE WHOLE THING.
SO NIXON SEALED HIS FATE SIX DAYS AFTER THE BREAK-IN.
( chanting ):
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
Narrator:
MIAMI BEACH, AUGUST 1972.
TWO MONTHS AFTER THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN,
A TRIUMPHANT RICHARD NIXON TOOK COMMAND
AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.
NARROWLY ELECTED FOUR YEARS EARLIER,
NIXON NOW WANTED TO WIN THE BIGGEST LANDSLIDE
IN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY.
TONIGHT, I AGAIN PROUDLY ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
( cheering )
AND LET US PLEDGE OURSELVES TO WIN AN EVEN GREATER VICTORY
THIS NOVEMBER, IN 1972.
( cheering )
♫VOTE NIXON NOW♫
♫NIXON NOW♫
♫HE'S MADE THE DIFFERENCE♫
♫HE'S SHOWN US HOW...♫
Narrator:
NIXON'S CAMPAIGN AMASSED HUGE SUMS OF MONEY.
SKILLFUL TELEVISION ADS APPEALED TO DEMOCRATS,
BLUE COLLAR WORKERS,
THE SOUTH.
NIXON HAD ALWAYS CAMPAIGNED HARD FOR OTHER REPUBLICANS.
NOW HE ABANDONED THEM, EVEN DROPPED THE PARTY LABEL.
RICHARD NIXON CAMPAIGNED AS "THE PRESIDENT."
YOU'RE GREAT.
THANK YOU, YOU'RE GREAT.
Narrator:
AS THE PRESIDENT PURSUED VICTORY,
THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUED TO DENY INVOLVEMENT IN WATERGATE.
A FEW REPORTERS FOLLOWED THE STORY,
BUT MOST VOTERS DISMISSED THE BREAK-IN
AS A "CAMPAIGN CAPER."
WATERGATE NEVER THREATENED NIXON'S BIG WIN.
NIXON OVERWHELMED HIS DEMOCRATIC RIVAL, SENATOR GEORGE McGOVERN.
HE CARRIED EVERY STATE BUT MASSACHUSETTS.
BUT HIS VICTORY WAS NOT COMPLETE.
THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION RETAINED CONTROL
OF BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.
Man:
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A LONELY LANDSLIDE.
HE MONOPOLIZED ALL OF THE RESOURCES, ALL OF THE MONEY,
ALL OF THE POLITICAL TALENT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT HE COULD ANNEX
FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL VICTORY
AND DIDN'T SHARE THE WEALTH AND THE OPPORTUNITY WITH HIS PARTY.
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY SELFISH VICTORY, IN MY VIEW.
Announcer:
WE ARE SHOWING PRESIDENT NIXON...
Narrator:
ON ELECTION NIGHT,
NIXON WATCHED THE RETURNS WITH TWO OF HIS CLOSEST AIDES--
CHIEF OF STAFF H.R. HALDEMAN
AND SPECIAL COUNSEL CHUCK COLSON.
Colson:
AND I COULDN'T FEEL ANY SENSE OF JUBILATION.
IT WAS JUST SORT OF A VERY DEPRESSED ATMOSPHERE.
HERE WE WERE SUPPOSEDLY WINNING,
AND IT WAS MORE LIKE WE'D LOST.
THE ATTITUDE WAS KIND OF, "WELL, WE SHOWED THEM.
WE GOT EVEN WITH OUR ENEMIES AND WE BEAT THEM."
INSTEAD OF "WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A WONDERFUL MANDATE
TO RULE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS."
WE WERE REDUCED TO OUR PETTY WORST
ON THE NIGHT OF WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUR GREATEST TRIUMPH,
AND THAT'S INDICATIVE OF KIND OF THE PARADOX OF THE NIXON YEARS.
"I'M AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN THE MELANCHOLY
THAT SETTLED OVER ME ON THAT VICTORIOUS NIGHT,"
NIXON LATER WROTE.
"TO SOME EXTENT THE MARRING EFFECTS OF WATERGATE
"MAY HAVE PLAYED A PART,
"TO SOME EXTENT OUR FAILURE TO WIN CONGRESS,
"AND TO A GREATER EXTENT,
"THE FACT THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO END THE WAR IN VIETNAM.
"WHATEVER THE REASONS,
"I ALLOWED MYSELF ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO REFLECT ON THE PAST.
I WAS CONFIDENT THAT A NEW ERA WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN."
Ehrlichman:
THE NEXT MORNING AFTER THE ELECTION,
NIXON CAME IN THE CABINET ROOM--
THE CABINET, SOME OF THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF WERE THERE.
EVERYBODY STOOD AND APPLAUDED, AND HE SAT DOWN
AND IMMEDIATELY WANTED TO GET DOWN TO WORK.
AND WORK WAS, "BY GOLLY, WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS GOVERNMENT.
"AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO GIVE ME HIS RESIGNATION.
"BOB HALDEMAN HERE WILL TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE IN MIND
"WHERE THAT'S CONCERNED.
"I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB;
I APPRECIATE IT."
AND HE GOT UP AND LEFT.
AND THEN HALDEMAN GOT UP AND SAID,
"THE PRESIDENT WANTS EVERYBODY'S RESIGNATION."
AND THIS HIT LIKE A COLD SLAP IN THE FACE.
IT WASN'T INTENDED THAT WAY.
WHAT HE WANTED TO DO
WAS TO HAVE HIS SECOND ADMINISTRATION START FRESH--
A FRESH BEGINNING.
Narrator:
NIXON LEFT WASHINGTON
AND FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS REMAINED IN VIRTUAL ISOLATION.
Nixon:
ONE CONSTANTLY HAS THE PROBLEM
OF EITHER GETTING ON TOP OF THE JOB
OR HAVING THE JOB GET ON TOP OF YOU.
I FIND THAT UP HERE ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN
IT IS EASIER FOR ME TO GET ON TOP OF THE JOB.
Broder:
THIS WAS A PERIOD
THAT IS SO NIXONIAN.
I MEAN, YOU COULD JUST FOCUS ON THAT
AND SAY, "THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF THE MAN."
INSTEAD OF SAVORING THE VICTORY,
INSTEAD OF REACHING OUT AND EMBRACING PEOPLE,
HE WITHDREW WITHIN HIMSELF.
Narrator:
ALONE ON HIS MOUNTAINTOP,
NIXON BROODED OVER THE ISSUE THAT HAD HAUNTED HIS FIRST TERM
AND NOW THREATENED HIS SECOND-- THE WAR IN VIETNAM.
THE PARIS PEACE TALKS WERE AGAIN STALLED.
REELECTED BY AN OVERWHELMING MARGIN,
HE NOW RESOLVED TO USE OVERWHELMING FORCE
TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK ONCE AND FOR ALL.
IN DECEMBER, NIXON ORDERED THE MOST INTENSIVE BOMBING
OF THE ENTIRE WAR.
IT BECAME KNOWN AS "THE CHRISTMAS BOMBING."
THE RAIDS WENT ON FOR 12 DAYS.
IGNORING THE PLEAS OF HIS CLOSEST AIDES,
NIXON GAVE NO PUBLIC EXPLANATION FOR HIS ACTION.
Price:
HE THOUGHT IT WAS DIPLOMATICALLY VITAL
THAT HE MAKE THIS LOOK AS COLD AN OPERATION AS POSSIBLE
AND SO HE WOULD NOT EXPLAIN IT.
HE HELD HIMSELF APART UP ON THE MOUNTAINTOP IN CAMP DAVID,
KNOWING HIS SILENCE WOULD MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE.
Narrator:
THE NEW YORK TIMES DENOUNCED
WHAT IT CALLED NIXON'S "STONE-AGE BARBARISM."
THE MASSIVE, UNEXPLAINED DESTRUCTION
ALARMED EVEN HIS LOYAL SUPPORTERS.
Interviewer:
YOU WERE QUOTED RECENTLY AS SAYING
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS SENSES.
I FEEL THAT HE'S DONE THINGS HERE
THAT A REASONABLE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE DONE.
AND I CAN'T FIND AN EXPLANATION FOR IT.
Narrator:
THE BOMBING STOPPED.
THE CONTROVERSY SUBSIDED.
AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER, ALL SIDES RETURNED TO PARIS.
NIXON BELIEVED THE CHRISTMAS BOMBING
HAD DRIVEN HANOI BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE.
TWO WEEKS LATER, IN A QUIET CEREMONY,
THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT.
NIXON'S CRITICS CHARGED
HE COULD HAVE HAD THE SAME TERMS MONTHS BEFORE.
BUT AFTER 20 YEARS OF AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT,
THE LOSS OF OVER 50,000 AMERICAN LIVES,
THE CONFLICT THAT HAD TORN APART THE NATION
AT LONG LAST CAME TO A CLOSE.
Nixon:
A CEASE-FIRE WILL BEGIN
AT 7:00 P.M. THIS SATURDAY, JANUARY 27, WASHINGTON TIME.
WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM THIS SATURDAY
ALL AMERICANS HELD PRISONERS OF WAR THROUGHOUT INDOCHINA
WILL BE RELEASED.
DURING THE SAME 60-DAY PERIOD
ALL AMERICAN FORCES WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM SOUTH VIETNAM.
Narrator:
IN VIETNAM, THE FIGHTING LATER RESUMED
BUT IN AMERICA, THE WEARY TROOPS AND THE PRISONERS OF WAR
WERE FINALLY COMING HOME.
( onlookers cheering )
Man:
I HAVE THREE WORDS FOR AMERICA--
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
Narrator:
H.R. HALDEMAN RECALLED THAT THE DAY THE WAR ENDED
RICHARD NIXON HAD NEVER LOOKED SO HAPPY.
HIS POPULARITY SOARED
TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
ALMOST 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORTED THE PRESIDENT.
IT WAS NOT TO LAST.
( police siren )
Narrator:
ONE MONTH BEFORE THE WATERGATE BURGLARS WENT ON TRIAL,
A 737 CRASHED IN CHICAGO.
AMONG THE DEAD WAS DOROTHY HUNT,
WIFE OF WATERGATE BURGLAR HOWARD HUNT.
HER PURSE, FOUND IN THE WRECKAGE,
CONTAINED $10,000 IN CASH.
LATER IT WOULD BE REVEALED THAT MRS. HUNT HAD ACTED AS A COURIER
DELIVERING MONEY DRAWN FROM SECRET WHITE HOUSE FUNDS--
HUSH MONEY USED TO BUY THE BURGLARS' SILENCE.
FROM THE MOMENT THEY WERE CAUGHT,
THE BURGLARS LIED TO CONCEAL THEIR TIES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
QUESTIONED BY THE F.B.I.,
G. GORDON LIDDY, WHO'D PLANNED THE BURGLARY,
AND JAMES McCORD,
FORMER C.I.A. AGENT WHO HAD HELPED TO CARRY IT OUT,
INSISTED THEY HAD ACTED ON THEIR OWN.
SO DID THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.
NIXON'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL
JOHN MITCHELL, WHO HAD APPROVED THE BREAK-IN,
DENIED RESPONSIBILITY.
THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF, H.R. HALDEMAN,
AUTHORIZED HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS TOTALLING MORE THAN $350,000.
THE PRESIDENT'S DOMESTIC ADVISOR, JOHN EHRLICHMAN,
LIED TO THE F.B.I. AND GRAND JURY INVESTIGATING THE BREAK-IN.
THE PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL, JOHN DEAN, WITHHELD EVIDENCE,
COACHED WITNESSES, AND MONITORED THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION.
THE COVER-UP WAS HOLDING
BUT BY EARLY '73, IT WAS CONSUMING THE TIME AND ATTENTION
OF NIXON'S CLOSEST AIDES, HALDEMAN AND EHRLICHMAN.
BY FEBRUARY, JOHN DEAN HAD ASSUMED MORE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MANAGING THE COVER-UP.
HE BEGAN TO MEET FREQUENTLY WITH THE PRESIDENT.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED DEALING WITH THE PRESIDENT,
MY FIRST CONCERN WAS
WHETHER I SHOULD EVEN BE DEALING WITH HIM ON THIS,
BECAUSE I FELT THAT NOT ONLY HAD I BEEN COMPROMISED,
I THOUGHT HALDEMAN, EHRLICHMAN, MITCHELL,
ALL OF US HAD, BECAUSE BY NOW,
I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A CRIMINAL LAWYER;
I KNEW WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF SOMETHING BAD.
I MEAN, THIS IS A COVER-UP.
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.
Narrator:
NIXON NOTED IN HIS DIARY,
"I AM GLAD THAT I AM TALKING TO DEAN NOW
"RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH HALDEMAN OR EHRLICHMAN.
"I THINK I'VE MADE A MISTAKE IN GOING THROUGH OTHERS
"WHEN THERE IS A MAN WITH THE CAPABILITY OF DEAN
I CAN TALK TO DIRECTLY."
BOTH NIXON AND DEAN SENSED
GROWING DANGER FROM CAPITOL HILL.
THE SENATE, UNDER DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP,
WAS FORMING A SPECIAL WATERGATE COMMITTEE
TO INVESTIGATE THE BREAK-IN
AND THE CONDUCT OF NIXON'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN.
BUT THE MOST IMMEDIATE THREAT
CAME FROM WATERGATE BURGLAR HOWARD HUNT.
DESPAIRING OVER THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE,
CONCERNED OVER THE FATE OF HIS CHILDREN,
HE NOW DEMANDED $120,000 OR HE WOULD REVEAL, HE SAID,
THE "SEAMY THINGS" HE HAD DONE FOR THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE.
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
ONE OF THESE THREATS HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT DIRECTLY TO ME
AND I DIDN'T LIKE BEING IN THAT ROLE.
BECAUSE I KNEW ABOUT THE MONEY OUT THERE,
BUT I HAD NEVER BEEN A CONVEYOR OF MESSAGES BACK AND FORTH,
AND HOW SUDDENLY I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF ANOTHER UGLY SIDE OF THIS.
Narrator:
HUNT'S DEMAND WAS A TURNING POINT FOR JOHN DEAN.
THE WHITE HOUSE COULD NO LONGER CONTROL THE COVER-UP.
ON MARCH 21, A WORRIED DEAN TRIED TO PERSUADE NIXON
TO END THE CONSPIRACY.
HE DESCRIBED THE COVER-UP AS A CANCER ON THE PRESIDENCY
AND WARNED THAT HALDEMAN, EHRLICHMAN
AND DEAN HIMSELF HAD BROKEN THE LAW.
THE PRESIDENT STARTED KNOCKING DOWN
EVERY ONE OF THESE HORRIBLES I KEPT RAISING.
FINALLY I GOT AROUND TO SAYING,
"WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS WANT A LOT MORE MONEY
"TO REMAIN QUIET,
AND THERE'S JUST NO TELLING HOW MUCH THEY WANT."
HE SAID, "WELL, HOW MUCH COULD THEY WANT?"
AND I PULLED OUT OF THIN AIR
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A PRETTY ASTRONOMICAL NUMBER.
I SAID, "WELL, IT COULD COST A MILLION DOLLARS."
HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID,
"JOHN, I KNOW WHERE WE CAN GET A MILLION DOLLARS."
Narrator:
NIXON APPROVED MORE HUSH MONEY.
HE LET THE COVER-UP CONTINUE.
TWO DAYS LATER, THE COVER-UP BLEW WIDE OPEN.
THERE WAS A MAJOR BREAK IN THE WATERGATE TRIAL TODAY.
ON THIS DAY OF SENTENCING,
ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS, JAMES McCORD, PROMISED
TO REVEAL HIDDEN DETAILS
ABOUT THE BUGGING OF THE DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS.
Narrator:
IN A LETTER TO THE PRESIDING JUDGE,
JAMES McCORD ADMITTED
THAT THE WATERGATE BURGLARS HAD NOT ACTED ON THEIR OWN.
HIS TESTIMONY IMPLICATED THE WHITE HOUSE
AND GALVANIZED THE NATIONAL PRESS.
EVEN BEFORE McCORD'S LETTER,
NIXON HAD ORDERED JOHN DEAN TO WRITE A REPORT
THAT WOULD EXONERATE THE WHITE HOUSE OF WRONGDOING.
Ehrlichman:
THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIM
TO REDUCE HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM TO WRITING.
HE ASKED HIM TO DO THAT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AND NOTHING HAPPENED.
AND FINALLY THE PRESIDENT SENT JOHN DEAN
TO CAMP DAVID IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH
TO SIT DOWN, DO NOTHING BUT WRITE A REPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT
ON WHAT THIS WATERGATE BUSINESS WAS ALL ABOUT--
WHO WAS INVOLVED, WHO WAS AT FAULT, ALL OF THAT.
WHILE DEAN WAS UP THERE, HE HAD AN EPIPHANY
WHICH WAS THAT HE WAS IN DEEP TROUBLE, OR SO HE SAYS.
WELL, IT WAS MUCH CLEARER AFTER THE FACT,
BUT I SUSPECTED AT THE TIME I WAS BEING SET UP
AND THE WHOLE PLAN WAS TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THIS REPORT
SO HE COULD SAY, "THIS IS ALL I'VE EVER KNOWN
AND MY COUNSEL LIED TO ME, CLEARLY."
AND I JUST WASN'T GOING TO BE PART OF THAT.
Narrator:
THE COVER-UP WAS DISINTEGRATING
AND DEAN FEARED THAT HE MIGHT BECOME NIXON'S SCAPEGOAT.
IN EARLY APRIL, HE TELEPHONED HALDEMAN
TO SAY HE WAS TALKING WITH THE PROSECUTORS.
HALDEMAN CAUTIONED HIM, "I THINK YOU OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT IT
"BECAUSE ONCE THE TOOTHPASTE IS OUT OF THE TUBE
IT'S HARD TO GET IT BACK IN."
"IF DEAN IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL," EHRLICHMAN TOLD NIXON,
"YOU COULD GET AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT."
HALDEMAN LATER REMEMBERED THAT NIXON LOOKED STUNNED.
IN PRIVATE, THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED
TO SEARCH FOR A SCAPEGOAT
AND STRUGGLED TO SALVAGE THE COVER-UP.
IN PUBLIC, HE ACTED AS IF HE WERE UPHOLDING THE LAW.
I CAN REPORT TODAY
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE
CONCERNING WHICH IT WOULD BE IMPROPER TO BE MORE SPECIFIC NOW
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT REAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE
IN FINDING THE TRUTH.
I CONDEMN ANY ATTEMPTS TO COVER UP IN THIS CASE,
NO MATTER WHO IS INVOLVED.
THANK YOU.
Narrator:
EVENTS WERE SPINNING OUT OF NIXON'S CONTROL.
JOHN DEAN, BARGAINING FOR IMMUNITY
WITH WATERGATE PROSECUTOR EARL SILBERT
MADE A STUNNING REVELATION.
DEAN'S LAWYER SAID, "DEAN HAS ONE MORE THING TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW ABOUT."
AND DEAN AT THAT POINT SAID--
WE'RE IN THE HALLWAY AND DEAN IS IN THE OFFICE--
HE SAID, IN SUBSTANCE, THAT LIDDY AND HUNT
WERE INVOLVED IN A BREAK-IN
INTO THE OFFICE OF ELLSBERG'S PSYCHIATRIST,
DAN ELLSBERG'S PSYCHIATRIST.
I KNOW MY JAW MUST HAVE FALLEN DOWN TO THE FLOOR.
THAT WAS A BOMBSHELL OF INFORMATION.
Narrator:
FOR TWO YEARS, THE BURGLARY OF ELLSBERG'S PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE
HAD REMAINED ONE OF THE MOST CLOSELY GUARDED SECRETS
OF THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE.
NOW DEAN'S REVELATION SUGGESTED
THAT THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN WAS NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT.
IT WAS PART OF A WEB OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
ORDERED BY THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.
VACATIONING IN KEY BISCAYNE,
NIXON KNEW DEAN HAD TALKED TO THE PROSECUTORS.
BUT HE STILL HOPED TO APPEAL TO DEAN'S LOYALTY
NOT TO REVEAL ANY MORE.
ON EASTER SUNDAY, NIXON CALLED DEAN.
People:
HAPPY EASTER!
AND HE SAID HE'D BEEN OUT WITH THE FAMILY
TO EASTER SUNDAY OR WHAT HAVE YOU,
AND HE SAID, "I WANT YOU TO KNOW, JOHN,
YOU'RE STILL MY COUNSEL."
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"B.S., I'M ABOUT AS CLOSE TO BEING HIS COUNSEL NOW
AS THE MAN IN THE MOON."
HE JUST WAS KEEPING LITTLE FEELERS OUT THERE.
BUT I MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR TO ALL OF THE---
THE WORD I WAS PUTTING BACK TO EVERYBODY--
I WASN'T MAKING ANY DEALS.
I WASN'T INTERESTED IN ANY DEALS.
I THINK NIXON HOPED THAT HE COULD MAKE A BARGAIN WITH DEAN
AND SAY, IN EFFECT, "YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR PRESIDENT."
BUT THE MUCH STRONGER VOICE THAT DEAN WAS HEARING
WAS THE PROSECUTOR SAYING,
"BOY, I'M GOING TO NAIL YOU TO THE WALL
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME ALL THE DIRT."
Narrator:
AS DEAN AND OTHER AIDES SCRAMBLED FOR IMMUNITY,
RUMORS SWIRLED ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE,
COMING EVER CLOSER TO THE OVAL OFFICE.
IN APRIL, ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HALDEMAN AND EHRLICHMAN
DOMINATED THE HEADLINES.
THE TWO MEN HAD PROTECTED THE PRESIDENT,
GUARDED HIS PRIVACY, SHARED HIS AMBITIONS.
BUT NOW, NIXON WOULD SACRIFICE HIS CLOSEST AIDES.
THE LAST SUNDAY IN APRIL, HE SUMMONED THEM TO CAMP DAVID.
THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME WAS,
"WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT,
I PRAYED THAT I WOULD NOT WAKE UP THIS MORNING."
AND HE BEGAN TO REALLY CRY.
HE BEGAN TO REALLY CRY AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I HAD JUST NEVER SEEN HIM OUT OF CONTROL THIS WAY.
HE FINALLY SAID, BASICALLY--
THE WORDS HAVE GONE, I'VE FORGOTTEN.
I WENT BACK AND MADE VERY CAREFUL NOTES
SO THAT SOMEWHERE I HAVE NOTES OF THIS CONVERSATION--
BUT THE GIST OF IT WAS THAT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE SO SERIOUS
THAT HE COULDN'T KEEP US ON.
HE THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD STAY ON, BOB AND I,
ON A LEAVE OF ABSENCE OR SOME SUCH FORM.
BUT HE SAW THAT HE HAD TO CUT IT OFF
THAT HE WAS GOING TO FIRE DEAN AT THE SAME TIME
AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO FIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
AT SOME POINT HE ASKED ME
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT HE COULD DO FOR ME.
I SAID, "YEAH, I'D LIKE YOU TO EXPLAIN THIS ALL TO MY KIDS
"BECAUSE I'M HAVING TROUBLE EXPLAINING TO THEM
WHY YOU WOULD DO THIS."
AND...
HE DIDN'T RESPOND TO THAT.
SO WE ENDED UP IN A HUG.
WE HUGGED EACH OTHER
AND I COULD SEE THAT HE HAD SAID EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD
AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT.
Narrator:
IN MAY, THE PRESIDENT AND MRS. NIXON
WELCOMED THE RETURNING P.O.W.s TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
Nixon:
IT IS ALWAYS THE CUSTOM AT A DINNER AT THE WHITE HOUSE
TO HAVE A TOAST TO THE HONORED GUEST.
THE DIFFICULTY TONIGHT IS
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY HONORED GUESTS
THAT WE WOULD BE DRINKING ALL NIGHT AND INTO THE DAY.
SOMEBODY JUST SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?"
Narrator:
NEW WATERGATE CHARGES WERE ERUPTING DAILY,
BUT THE P.O.W.s REMAINED LOYAL TO THEIR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
AND, SIR, I WOULD LIKE TO STATE FOR ALL OF US
THAT WE NEVER LOST FAITH IN YOUR INTEGRITY OR YOUR COURAGE
AND WE ARE PROUD TO BE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES.
Narrator:
BUT THE PUBLIC'S FAITH IN THE PRESIDENT
WOULD SOON BE SEVERELY TESTED.
THE SENATE WATERGATE COMMITTEE BEGAN HEARINGS
THAT WOULD KEEP THE NATION SPELLBOUND
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER.
Announcer:
THE HISTORIC CAUCUS ROOM WAS JAMMED TODAY WITH CAMERAS,
NEWSMEN, 200 SEATED SPECTATORS AND MORE STANDING.
THIS ROOM HAS BEEN THE SCENE...
Narrator:
ONE OF THE LARGEST AUDIENCES IN TELEVISION HISTORY
WATCHED ON MAY 17
AS SENATOR SAM ERVIN OPENED THE INVESTIGATION
OF NIXON'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN AND THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN.
THE COMMITTEE WILL COME TO ORDER.
Narrator:
EVEN THE PRESIDENT'S STAFF WATCHED
AS A PARADE OF WITNESSES IMPLICATED HALDEMAN, EHRLICHMAN
AND OTHERS HIGH IN THE ADMINISTRATION
AND THE NIXON CAMPAIGN.
BUT IN THE FIRST MONTH OF TESTIMONY,
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF ESCAPED DIRECT CHARGES OF WRONGDOING.
THEN THE COMMITTEE SUMMONED ITS STAR WITNESS-
- JOHN DEAN.
IN A SEVEN-HOUR OPENING STATEMENT,
DEAN DESCRIBED THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE.
Dean:
THE WATERGATE MATTER
WAS AN INEVITABLE OUTGROWTH OF A CLIMATE OF EXCESSIVE CONCERN
OVER THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF DEMONSTRATORS,
EXCESSIVE CONCERN OVER LEAKS,
AN INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE,
ALL COUPLED WITH A DO-IT- YOURSELF WHITE HOUSE STAFF
REGARDLESS OF THE LAW.
HE SPOKE IN ALMOST A MONOTONE
AS HE BEGAN TO TELL SOME OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS STORIES
ABOUT WHAT HAD OCCURRED, AND COMING FROM A MONOTONE,
IT WAS THE FACTS RATHER THAN HIS PERSONALITY
THAT CAME OUT AT THE PUBLIC.
Narrator:
DEAN DESCRIBED HIS MEETING ON MARCH 21,
WHEN HE WARNED NIXON ABOUT THE BURGLARS' ESCALATING DEMANDS.
I TOLD THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE FACT THERE WAS NO MONEY
TO PAY THESE INDIVIDUALS TO MEET THEIR DEMANDS.
HE ASKED ME HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST.
I TOLD HIM I COULD ONLY MAKE AN ESTIMATE
THAT IT MIGHT BE AS HIGH AS A MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE.
HE TOLD ME THAT THAT WAS NO PROBLEM.
HE ALSO LOOKED OVER AT HALDEMAN AND REPEATED THE SAME STATEMENT.
THAT STORY CAME OUT,
IT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME IN THE HEARING,
THE VERY FIRST TIME ANY EVIDENCE CAME FORWARD
THAT REALLY PUT THE PRESIDENT IN ON THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE--
THE PRESIDENT WHO SAID HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THESE THINGS,
THE PRESIDENT WHO SAID HE HAD STARTED AN INVESTIGATION
TO FIND OUT WHO WAS INVOLVED.
AND HERE WAS A EYEWITNESS,
A PERSON WHO WAS INVOLVED WHO WAS TESTIFYING
TO THE PRESIDENT'S VERY DEEP INVOLVEMENT
IN THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND THE COVER-UP.
Narrator:
IT WAS NOW THE WORD OF THE PRESIDENT
AGAINST HIS 34-YEAR-OLD FORMER COUNSEL.
THE WHITE HOUSE TRIED TO UNDERMINE DEAN'S TESTIMONY
BY SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT HIS CREDIBILITY AND CHARACTER.
WITH NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHO WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,
NIXON BELIEVED HE WOULD PREVAIL.
THEN ON JULY 16, EVERYTHING CHANGED FOR RICHARD NIXON.
Man:
MY NAME IS ALEXANDER PORTER BUTTERFIELD.
Man:
MR. BUTTERFIELD, ARE YOU AWARE
OF THE INSTALLATION OF ANY LISTENING DEVICES
IN THE OVAL OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT?
I WAS AWARE OF LISTENING DEVICES, YES, SIR.
SO THAT IF EITHER MR. DEAN, MR. HALDEMAN,
MR. EHRLICHMAN, MR. COLSON HAD
PARTICULAR MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH THE PRESIDENT
ON THE PARTICULAR DATES
THAT HAVE BEEN TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE,
THERE WOULD BE A TAPE RECORDING WITH THE PRESIDENT
OF THAT FULL CONVERSATION, WOULD THERE NOT?
YES, SIR.
ONE LAST QUESTION.
IF ONE WERE, THEREFORE,
TO RECONSTRUCT THE CONVERSATIONS
AT ANY PARTICULAR DATE
WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY
TO RECONSTRUCT THOSE CONVERSATIONS, MR. BUTTERFIELD?
WELL, IN THE OBVIOUS MANNER, MR. DASH:
TO OBTAIN THE TAPE AND PLAY IT.
Dash:
I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, MR. CHAIRMAN.
Narrator:
NIXON WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH VIRAL PNEUMONIA
WHEN HE LEARNED ABOUT BUTTERFIELD'S TESTIMONY.
HE WROTE ON A BEDSIDE PAD,
"SHOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE TAPES AFTER APRIL 30."
NIXON KNEW CONTROLLING THE TAPES WAS THE KEY TO HIS SURVIVAL.
HE WOULD APPEAL TO HISTORICAL PRECEDENT
AND ARGUE THAT THE TAPES WERE LIKE PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS--
THEY BELONGED TO THE PRESIDENT, NOT TO CONGRESS OR THE COURTS.
THE PRESIDENT HAD A RIGHT TO KEEP THEM PRIVATE.
THE BATTLE FOR THE TAPES BEGAN
WITH THE PRESIDENT RALLYING THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF.
Nixon:
I WAS RATHER AMUSED
BY SOME VERY WELL-INTENTIONED PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT
THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE RATHER ROUGH ASSAULTS
THAT ANY MAN IN THIS OFFICE GETS FROM TIME TO TIME
BRINGS ON AN ILLNESS
AND THAT AFTER GOING THROUGH SUCH AN ILLNESS
I MIGHT GET SO TIRED
THAT I WOULD CONSIDER EITHER SLOWING DOWN OR... ( laughs incredulously )
OR EVEN, SOME SUGGESTED, RESIGNING.
WELL, NOW, JUST SO WE SET THAT TO REST,
I'M GOING TO USE A PHRASE THAT MY OHIO FATHER USED TO USE.
"THAT'S JUST PLAIN POPPYCOCK."
WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON THIS JOB TILL WE GET THE JOB DONE.
AND LET OTHERS WALLOW IN WATERGATE--
WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR JOB.
( applause )
Narrator:
THE CONTINUING INVESTIGATIONS PLACED NEW PRESSURES
ON THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE WATERGATE COMMITTEE ISSUED A SUBPOENA
FOR THE PRESIDENT'S TAPES.
NIXON REFUSED TO COMPLY
AND RISKED BEING FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.
BUT EVEN THAT WAS NOT HIS BIGGEST CONCERN.
PRESSURED BY CONGRESS,
ATTORNEY GENERAL ELLIOT RICHARDSON AGREED
TO APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
HE CHOSE ARCHIBALD COX, AND GAVE HIM SWEEPING POWERS
TO INVESTIGATE THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE.
Reporter:
WHAT IF THIS TRAIL LEADS
INTO THE OVAL OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE?
AS I REPLIED THEN,
THE TRAIL SHOULD BE FOLLOWED WHEREVER IT LEADS.
Narrator:
NIXON LATER DESCRIBED COX
AS "THE PARTISAN VIPER WE HAD PLANTED IN OUR BOSOM."
Price:
WE SAW ARCHIE COX IN POLITICAL RATHER THAN LEGAL TERMS.
HE WAS SORT OF THE HIGH GURU
OF THE KENNEDY GOVERNMENT- IN-WAITING IN CAMBRIDGE.
THE IDEA THAT THESE KENNEDY AND McGOVERN POLITICAL OPERATIVES
WERE GOING TO BE DEMANDING TO RUN BAREFOOT
THROUGH ALL THE MOST PRIVATE FILES OF THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE
WAS UTTERLY APPALLING AND ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS.
Narrator:
COX AND HIS STAFF REQUESTED SENSITIVE WHITE HOUSE FILES.
NIXON RELUCTANTLY COMPLIED.
COX ALSO DEMANDED NINE OF THE PRESIDENT'S TAPES.
NIXON REFUSED.
COX TOOK HIS CASE TO COURT.
AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, I AM SURE
THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL POSITION IS PRESENTED IN GOOD FAITH.
I THINK IT'S QUITE WRONG...
Narrator:
BY THE END OF SUMMER,
NIXON'S REFUSAL TO TURN OVER THE TAPES
AND JOHN DEAN'S TESTIMONY
HAD BADLY ERODED THE PUBLIC'S SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT.
BUT AFTER MONTHS OF UNRELENTING PRESS COVERAGE,
NIXON SENSED THAT AMERICANS WERE GROWING WEARY OF WATERGATE.
HE MOVED TO TAKE THE OFFENSIVE.
MR. PRESIDENT!
MR. PRESIDENT!
Narrator:
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 14 MONTHS
NIXON HELD A TELEVISED NEWS CONFERENCE
AND TRIED TO TURN THE PERSISTENT QUESTIONING TO HIS ADVANTAGE.
Reporter:
AT ANY TIME DURING THE WATERGATE CRISIS,
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER RESIGNING
AND WOULD YOU CONSIDER RESIGNING IF YOU FELT
THAT YOUR CAPACITY TO GOVERN HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY WEAKENED
AND IN THAT CONNECTION, HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
YOUR CAPACITY TO GOVERN HAS BEEN WEAKENED?
THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS IS NO.
THE ANSWER TO THE THIRD QUESTION IS THAT IT IS TRUE
THAT AS FAR AS THE CAPACITY TO GOVERN IS CONCERNED
THAT TO BE UNDER A CONSTANT BARRAGE 12 TO 15 MINUTES A NIGHT
ON EACH OF THE THREE MAJOR NETWORKS FOR FOUR MONTHS
TENDS TO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS IN THE PEOPLE'S MIND
WITH REGARD TO THE PRESIDENT,
AND IT MAY RAISE SOME QUESTIONS
WITH REGARD TO THE CAPACITY TO GOVERN.
THE POINT THAT I MAKE NOW IS
THAT WE ARE PROCEEDING AS BEST WE KNOW HOW
TO GET ALL THOSE GUILTY BROUGHT TO JUSTICE IN WATERGATE.
BUT NOW WE MUST MOVE ON FROM WATERGATE
TO THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE,
AND THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE IS CONTINUING
WITH THE INITIATIVES WE BEGAN IN THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION.
Reporter:
Mr. President...
JUST A MOMENT.
WE'VE HAD 30 MINUTES OF THIS PRESS CONFERENCE.
I HAVE YET TO HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE,
ONE QUESTION ON THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE,
WHICH SHOWS YOU HOW WE'RE CONSUMED BY THIS.
Narrator:
BUT EVENTS OVERWHELMED THE PRESIDENT'S COUNTEROFFENSIVE.
IN A SCANDAL UNRELATED TO WATERGATE,
NIXON'S VICE-PRESIDENT, SPIRO AGNEW, WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION
FOR BRIBERY, TAX EVASION AND EXTORTION.
GENTLEMEN, I BELIEVE YOU'VE ALL RECEIVED COPIES
OF THE PREPARED STATEMENT THAT I READ TO THE COURT.
Narrator:
ON OCTOBER 10, AGNEW PLED "NO CONTEST" TO TAX EVASION
AND RESIGNED.
AGNEW'S DEPARTURE MADE NIXON MORE VULNERABLE.
UNLIKE AGNEW, HIS NEW VICE-PRESIDENT
AND POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR
WAS POPULAR WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE.
OUR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
I PROUDLY PRESENT TO YOU THE MAN WHOSE NAME I WILL SUBMIT
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES FOR CONFIRMATION
AS THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
CONGRESSMAN GERALD FORD OF MICHIGAN.
( applause )
Narrator:
ON CAPITOL HILL, GERALD FORD WAS ALREADY SEEN
AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.
THAT SAME DAY, THE COURT OF APPEALS RULED
THAT NIXON MUST YIELD THE TAPES
TO SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ARCHIBALD COX.
BUT NIXON SAW THE RULING
AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A SHOWDOWN WITH COX.
HE MADE AN OFFER
HE THOUGHT WOULD SOUND REASONABLE TO THE PUBLIC
BUT THAT HE WAS CERTAIN COX WOULD REJECT.
NIXON WOULD TURN OVER SUMMARIES OF THE TAPES
BUT NOT THE TAPES THEMSELVES,
AND HE ORDERED COX NOT TO ASK FOR ANY MORE MATERIAL.
AS NIXON EXPECTED, COX REFUSED.
THIS IS JIM DOYLE FROM ARCHIBALD COX'S OFFICE.
I HAVE A LONG STATEMENT.
ARE YOU READY?
"IN MY JUDGMENT, THE PRESIDENT IS REFUSING...
TO COMPLY...
WITH THE COURT DECREES."
Cox:
I THINK IT IS MY DUTY
TO BRING TO THE COURT'S ATTENTION
WHAT SEEMS TO ME
TO BE NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT'S ORDER.
Narrator:
WITHIN HOURS, NIXON ORDERED ELLIOT RICHARDSON
TO FIRE ARCHIBALD COX.
BUT NIXON HAD MISCALCULATED.
RICHARDSON REFUSED.
Richardson:
HE SAID, "DO YOU REALIZE, ELLIOT,
"THAT BREZHNEV MAY CONCLUDE
THAT I'M LOSING CONTROL OF MY OWN ADMINISTRATION?"
BUT I SAID, "MR. PRESIDENT, I AM COMMITTED
"TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
"FOR ME TO HAVE ACQUIESCED IN HIS BEING FIRED WOULD BE
A TOTAL BETRAYAL OF THAT COMMITMENT."
HE SAID, "I'M SORRY THAT YOU CHOOSE
"TO PREFER YOUR PURELY PERSONAL COMMITMENTS
TO THE NATIONAL INTEREST."
MUSTERING ALL MY SELF-CONTROL
I SAID IN AS LEVEL A VOICE AS I COULD
"MR. PRESIDENT, IT WOULD APPEAR
"THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT
OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST."
Narrator:
THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED BECAME KNOWN
AS "THE SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE."
GOOD EVENING.
THE COUNTRY TONIGHT IS IN THE MIDST OF WHAT MAY BE
THE MOST SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN ITS HISTORY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS FIRED
SPECIAL WATERGATE PROSECUTOR ARCHIBALD COX.
BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS RESIGNED.
ELLIOT RICHARDSON HAS QUIT,
SAYING HE CANNOT CARRY OUT MR. NIXON'S INSTRUCTIONS.
RICHARDSON'S DEPUTY, WILLIAM RUCKELSHAUS, HAS BEEN FIRED.
RUCKELSHAUS REFUSED, IN A MOMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL DRAMA,
TO OBEY A PRESIDENTIAL ORDER
TO FIRE THE SPECIAL WATERGATE PROSECUTOR.
AND HALF AN HOUR
AFTER THE SPECIAL WATERGATE PROSECUTOR HAD BEEN FIRED,
AGENTS OF THE F.B.I.,
ACTING AT THE DIRECTION OF THE WHITE HOUSE,
SEALED OFF THE OFFICES OF THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR,
THE OFFICES OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
AND THE OFFICES OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL.
SIX F.B.I. AGENTS PRESENT,
IMPEDING OUR OPERATIONS RIGHT NOW.
Newscaster:
ALL OF THIS ADDS UP TO A TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION,
A GRAVE AND PROFOUND CRISIS
IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAS SET HIMSELF
AGAINST HIS OWN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
Announcer:
MORE THAN 50,000 TELEGRAMS POURED IN ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY,
SO MANY, WESTERN UNION WAS SWAMPED.
MOST OF THEM DEMANDED IMPEACHING MR. NIXON.
Man:
THESE COME FROM REPUBLICANS AND BUSINESSMEN AND PEOPLE,
MOST OF WHOM BEGIN THEIR STATEMENT BY SAYING,
"I'VE SUPPORTED THE PRESIDENT,
"I'VE NEVER BELIEVED IN IMPEACHMENT,
"BUT HE'S NOW GONE TOO FAR
AND WE WANT THE CONGRESS TO TAKE STRONG ACTION."
IN MY THREE DISTRICT OFFICES IN ONE REPUBLICAN AREA,
MY PHONE CALLS WERE 100 TO ONE
IN FAVOR OF PURSUING THE PATH OF IMPEACHMENT,
WHICH WAS RATHER SHOCKING TO ME.
I WAS TERRIBLY SURPRISED,
WHICH SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT VERY WEIRD THING THAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A COCOON, OF A CRISIS
WITHIN A PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT
AND YOU HAVE A GREAT DESIRE FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN
AS YOU WANT THEM TO HAPPEN.
Narrator:
ON TUESDAY, NIXON LEARNED
THAT 21 RESOLUTIONS CALLING FOR HIS IMPEACHMENT
HAD BEEN INTRODUCED ON CAPITOL HILL.
STUNNED BY THE FEROCITY OF THE PUBLIC REACTION,
NIXON RETREATED.
HE APPOINTED A NEW SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, LEON JAWORSKI,
AND AGREED TO RELEASE THE NINE SUBPOENAED TAPES.
BUT TWO TAPES TURNED OUT TO BE MISSING.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY NEVER EXISTED.
A THIRD TAPE CONTAINED AN 18 1/2-MINUTE GAP.
THE ERASED SECTION WAS A CONVERSATION
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND H.R. HALDEMAN
THREE DAYS AFTER THE BREAK-IN.
THE PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL, FRED BUZHARDT,
EXPLAINED THE GAP TO A SKEPTICAL PRESS.
YOU NOW BELIEVE IT COULD BE ACCIDENTAL?
YES.
HOW?
Narrator:
THE WHITE HOUSE CLAIMED
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S SECRETARY, ROSEMARY WOODS,
HAD ACCIDENTALLY ERASED THE TAPE WHILE TRANSCRIBING IT.
IS THAT LOGICAL
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY?
I MEAN, IS THAT BELIEVABLE?
YES.
Narrator:
QUESTIONS NOW AROSE
ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S LIFE.
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, TAXES, FRIENDSHIPS, VACATION HOMES--
EVERYTHING SEEMED FAIR GAME.
THE PRESIDENT STRUGGLED TO DEFEND HIMSELF
AGAINST ASSAULTS THAT CAME FROM ALL SIDES.
I WANT TO SAY THIS TO THE TELEVISION AUDIENCE.
I'VE MADE MY MISTAKES
BUT IN ALL OF MY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE,
I HAVE NEVER PROFITED FROM PUBLIC SERVICE.
I HAVE EARNED EVERY CENT.
AND IN ALL OF MY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE
I HAVE NEVER OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE
AND I THINK, TOO, THAT I CAN SAY THAT IN MY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE
THAT I WELCOME THIS KIND OF EXAMINATION
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO KNOW
WHETHER OR NOT THEIR PRESIDENT IS A CROOK.
WELL, I AM NOT A CROOK.
I'VE EARNED EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.
Narrator:
IN MARCH 1974, NIXON WENT TO THE GRAND OLE OPRY
TO THE SOUTH, WHERE HIS SUPPORT REMAINED THE STRONGEST.
"IN THE END," HE LATER WROTE,
"IT WOULD COME DOWN TO A CAMPAIGN
"BUT THIS TIME I WOULD BE CAMPAIGNING
FOR MY POLITICAL LIFE."
IF YOU'LL JOIN US IN THIS SONG,
I THINK YOU'LL RECOGNIZE IT WHEN I START IT.
JUST LET ME GET A CHORD.
( plays introductory chords )
( plays "My Wild Irish Rose" )
♫IRISH ROSE...♫
Narrator:
BUT SEVEN OF NIXON'S CLOSEST AIDES HAD BEEN INDICTED
BY THE WATERGATE GRAND JURY.
AND THE AFTERSHOCKS OF THE SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE
CONTINUED TO REVERBERATE IN THE COURTS AND IN CONGRESS.
( "My Wild Irish Rose" ends )
ON CAPITOL HILL, THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WAS DEBATING
NIXON'S IMPEACHMENT, INVESTIGATING CHARGES
RANGING FROM ILLEGAL WIRETAPS AND BREAK-INS
TO ABUSE OF POWER AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
PURSUING THEIR INVESTIGATIONS, THEY DEMANDED MORE TAPES
AND SET A DEADLINE OF APRIL 30.
ON APRIL 29, WITH LESS THAN 24 HOURS TO GO,
FACING A CITATION FOR CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS,
NIXON TRIED TO DO AGAIN
WHAT HAD WORKED SO WELL FOR HIM IN THE PAST--
BYPASS HIS OPPONENTS AND APPEAL DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC.
GOOD EVENING.
I HAVE ASKED FOR THIS TIME TONIGHT
IN ORDER TO ANNOUNCE MY ANSWER
TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SUBPOENA
FOR ADDITIONAL WATERGATE TAPES.
IN THESE FOLDERS THAT YOU SEE OVER HERE ON MY LEFT
ARE MORE THAN 1,200 PAGES OF TRANSCRIPTS
OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS...
Narrator:
NIXON ANNOUNCED HE WAS RELEASING
EDITED TRANSCRIPTS OF THE TAPES
TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC SIMULTANEOUSLY.
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAD SUPERVISED THE EDITING.
IN GIVING YOU THESE RECORDS, BLEMISHES AND ALL,
I AM PLACING MY TRUST
IN THE BASIC FAIRNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Narrator:
NIXON HAD GAMBLED AND LOST.
HE BADLY MISJUDGED THE PUBLIC REACTION.
"THE TRANSCRIPTS," SAID TIME MAGAZINE,
"SHOWED A PRESIDENT CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT
OF DECEIT AND DISHONESTY, OF EVASION AND COVER-UP."
EVEN REPUBLICAN LEADERS DENOUNCED THEM
AS "SHABBY," "DISGUSTING," "IMMORAL."
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS NOW THOUGHT
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD RESIGN OR FACE IMPEACHMENT.
SOON AFTER THE TRANSCRIPTS WERE DELIVERED TO CAPITOL HILL,
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VOTED
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR SUBPOENA.
THEY CONTINUED TO DEMAND THE TAPES.
( tapes of conversations playing faintly )
IN THE WHITE HOUSE, NIXON SECLUDED HIMSELF,
LISTENING TO THE RECORDINGS OVER AND OVER.
NOT ONLY WAS CONGRESS DEMANDING THE TAPES,
SO WAS THE NEW SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
NIXON HAD EXHAUSTED ALL HIS LEGAL APPEALS BUT ONE.
HE TOOK HIS CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT.
IT WOULD BECOME KNOWN
AS THE UNITED STATES v. RICHARD NIXON.
AS HIS LAWYERS PREPARED TO ARGUE HIS CASE,
THE PRESIDENT TOOK HIS CAMPAIGN ABROAD,
HOPING TO BUILD ON THE DIPLOMATIC TRIUMPHS
OF THE PAST.
( crowd chanting )
FIRST TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE JUST MONTHS BEFORE
HIS PERSISTENT DIPLOMACY HAD HELPED BRING ABOUT
A FRAGILE PEACE BETWEEN ARABS AND ISRAELIS.
THEN TO THE SOVIET UNION,
WHERE THE GLITTERING CEREMONIES MIRRORED
THE PRESIDENT'S PAST SUCCESS.
BUT THE SUMMIT ACHIEVED LITTLE.
LEONID BREZHNEV SENSED THAT NIXON'S POWER WAS ERODING FAST.
( "Stars and Stripes Forever" )
RETURNING HOME, NIXON LANDED AT A SMALL AIR FORCE BASE IN MAINE,
WHERE THE MILITARY CROWD GAVE HIM A WARM WELCOME.
BUT THE EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY THAT HAD TAKEN RICHARD NIXON
ALL THE WAY FROM YORBA LINDA TO THE WHITE HOUSE,
TO PEKING AND MOSCOW,
FROM HUMILIATING DEFEATS TO THE PINNACLE OF WORLD POWER,
SEEMED TO BE COMING TO AN END.
MOST AMERICANS HAD LOST FAITH IN THE PRESIDENT--
THEY SAW A MAN WHO HAD REPEATEDLY LIED
TO COVER UP HIS CRIMES,
HAD SUBVERTED THE POLITICAL PROCESS
AND UNDERMINED THE CONSTITUTION.
Man:
THERE ARE FRIGHTENING IMPLICATIONS
FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY
IF WE DO NOT IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
IF WE FAIL TO IMPEACH,
WE HAVE CONDONED AND LEFT UNPUNISHED
A COURSE OF CONDUCT TOTALLY INCONSISTENT
WITH THE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Narrator:
ON CAPITOL HILL, THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PREPARED
TO VOTE ON THREE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT:
THEY CHARGED THE PRESIDENT WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE,
ABUSE OF POWER, AND CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.
Man:
THE THING THAT'S SO APPALLING TO ME IS
THAT THE PRESIDENT, WHEN THIS IDEA WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM,
DIDN'T, IN RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION,
RISE UP AND SAY, "GET OUT OF HERE,
"YOU'RE IN THE OFFICE
"OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
"HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT BLACKMAIL AND BRIBERY
"AND KEEPING WITNESSES SILENT?
THIS IS THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES."
BUT MY PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO THAT.
HE SAT THERE, AND HE WORKED AND WORKED TO TRY TO COVER THIS UP
SO IT WOULDN'T COME TO LIGHT.
Narrator:
THE COMMITTEE TOOK ITS FIRST VOTE JULY 27.
NIXON WAS SWIMMING AT SAN CLEMENTE
AS THEY RENDERED THEIR VERDICT.
Clerk:
...SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE.
ALL THOSE OPPOSED, NO.
Clerk:
MR. FLOWERS.
AYE.
MR. MANN.
AYE.
MR. DRINAN.
AYE.
Narrator:
NIXON LATER WROTE,
"I WAS GETTING DRESSED IN THE BEACH TRAILER
"WHEN THE PHONE RANG AND ZEIGLER GAVE ME THE NEWS.
"THAT WAS HOW I LEARNED
"THAT I WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 106 YEARS
"TO BE RECOMMENDED FOR IMPEACHMENT--
"STANDING IN THE BEACH TRAILER, BAREFOOT,
"WEARING OLD TROUSERS, A BANLON SHIRT
"AND A BLUE WINDBREAKER
EMBLAZONED WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL SEAL."
Clerk:
MR. RODINO.
AYE.
27 MEMBERS HAVE VOTED AYE.
11 MEMBERS HAVE VOTED NO.
AND PURSUANT TO THE RESOLUTION ARTICLE ONE,
THAT RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED AND WILL BE REPORTED TO THE HOUSE.
Narrator:
JUST DAYS BEFORE,
THE SUPREME COURT HAD RULED
IN THE CASE OF THE UNITED STATES v. RICHARD NIXON--
THE PRESIDENT MUST TURN OVER THE TAPES
TO THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
"NOT EVEN A PRESIDENT," SAID THE COURT,
"COULD WITHHOLD EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL."
NIXON RETURNED TO WASHINGTON, STILL CALCULATING THE ODDS.
HE KNEW THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WOULD VOTE TO INDICT HIM.
THERE WAS A CHANCE HE MIGHT SURVIVE A TRIAL IN THE SENATE
AS LONG AS THERE WAS NO IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE
THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY COMMITTED A CRIME.
Tape:
...under investigation of the Democratic break-in... ( recording inaudible )
Narrator:
BUT NIXON HIMSELF POSSESSED THAT EVIDENCE,
A TAPE THAT PLAINLY SHOWED HE'D OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE:
HIS CONVERSATION WITH H.R. HALDEMAN ON JUNE 23, 1972
WHEN NIXON ORDERED HIS AIDES TO DIVERT THE F.B.I.
Narrator:
NIXON WOULD SOON HAVE TO RELEASE THIS TAPE
ALONG WITH OTHERS COVERED BY THE SUPREME COURT RULING.
WITH NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE,
HE DECIDED TO RELEASE A TRANSCRIPT OF THE TAPE.
IT BECAME KNOWN AS "THE SMOKING GUN."
THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE TRANSCRIPT,
NIXON SAT ALONE IN THE LINCOLN SITTING ROOM,
THEN RETIRED TO BED.
HIS DAUGHTER JULIE HAD LEFT A NOTE ON HIS PILLOW:
"THE WHITE HOUSE, AUGUST 6.
"DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU.
"WHATEVER YOU DO, I WILL SUPPORT.
"I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
"GO THROUGH THE FIRE JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
"YOU'RE SO STRONG.
"I LOVE YOU.
"MILLIONS SUPPORT YOU.
JULIE."
ON AUGUST 8, NIXON ANNOUNCED HE WOULD ADDRESS THE NATION.
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, CROWDS GATHERED, WATCHING, WAITING.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A QUITTER.
TO LEAVE OFFICE BEFORE MY TERM IS COMPLETED
IS ABHORRENT TO EVERY INSTINCT IN MY BODY.
BUT AS PRESIDENT, I MUST PUT THE INTERESTS OF AMERICA FIRST.
THEREFORE, I SHALL RESIGN THE PRESIDENCY
EFFECTIVE AT NOON TOMORROW.
VICE-PRESIDENT FORD WILL BE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT
AT THAT HOUR IN THIS OFFICE.
Narrator:
ON AUGUST 9, THE PRESIDENT BID FAREWELL
TO THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF.
YOU ARE HERE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO US,
AND WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD WORD FOR IT IN ENGLISH.
THE BEST IS AU REVOIR-- WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.
( thunderous applause )
HAD A LITTLE QUOTE IN THE SPEECH LAST NIGHT FROM T.R.
AS YOU KNOW, I KIND OF LIKE TO READ BOOKS--
I'M NOT EDUCATED, BUT I DO READ BOOKS.
AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT I FOUND AS I WAS READING...
MY LAST NIGHT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND THIS QUOTE IS ABOUT A YOUNG MAN.
HE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER IN NEW YORK.
HE'D MARRIED A BEAUTIFUL GIRL...
AND THEY HAD A LOVELY DAUGHTER.
AND THEN SUDDENLY...
SHE DIED.
AND THIS IS WHAT HE WROTE.
THIS WAS IN HIS DIARY.
HE SAID, "SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL IN FACE AND FORM
"AND LOVELIER STILL IN SPIRIT.
"AS A FLOWER SHE GREW, AND AS A FAIR YOUNG FLOWER, SHE DIED.
"AND WHEN MY HEART'S DEAREST DIED... ( clears his throat )
THE LIGHT WENT FROM MY LIFE FOREVER."
THAT WAS T.R. IN HIS 20s.
HE THOUGHT THE LIGHT HAD GONE FROM HIS LIFE FOREVER.
BUT HE WENT ON.
AND HE NOT ONLY BECAME PRESIDENT
BUT AS AN EX-PRESIDENT, HE SERVED HIS COUNTRY,
ALWAYS IN THE ARENA, TEMPESTUOUS, STRONG,
SOMETIMES WRONG, SOMETIMES RIGHT.
BUT HE WAS A MAN.
IT'S ONLY A BEGINNING, ALWAYS.
THE YOUNG MUST KNOW IT, THE OLD MUST KNOW IT,
BECAUSE THE GREATNESS COMES
NOT WHEN THINGS GO ALWAYS GOOD FOR YOU,
BUT THE GREATNESS COMES WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TESTED,
WHEN YOU TAKE...
SOME KNOCKS,
SOME DISAPPOINTMENTS,
WHEN SADNESS COMES.
BECAUSE ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE DEEPEST VALLEY
CAN YOU EVER KNOW
HOW MAGNIFICENT IT IS TO BE ON THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN.
ALWAYS GIVE YOUR BEST,
NEVER GET DISCOURAGED,
NEVER BE PETTY,
ALWAYS REMEMBER
OTHERS MAY HATE YOU.
THOSE WHO HATE YOU DON'T WIN UNLESS YOU HATE THEM
AND THEN YOU DESTROY YOURSELF.
Narrator:
ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1974,
PRESIDENT GERALD FORD GRANTED RICHARD NIXON
A FULL AND ABSOLUTE PARDON.
OVER 70 OTHERS WERE FOUND GUILTY OF CRIMINAL ACTS, AND PUNISHED.
THE CONTRADICTIONS OF NIXON'S CAREER,
HIS TRIUMPHS AND DEFEATS,
GRAND VISION AND PETTY GRIEVANCES
HAVE LEFT THEIR IMPRINT ON AMERICA,
BUT HIS LEGACY REMAINS AMBIGUOUS.
"THE JUDGMENT OF HISTORY," NIXON HAS SAID,
"DEPENDS ON WHO WRITES IT."

PETER JENNINGS:
We interrupt your regular program for quite an extraordinary moment in the history of the United States.
A short while ago, President Clinton's staff came to tell us that he was going to come to the Rose Garden now and make some remarks.
REPORTER:
Peter, the president will make another attempt to say he's sorry about what he's caused.
NARRATOR:
Bill Clinton had come into office with notions of an heroic presidency, to inscribe his name in history alongside FDR and JFK.
Good afternoon.
NARRATOR:
But on the afternoon of December 11, 1998, he came to the Rose Garden of the White House to apologize to the American people.
I am profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds.
I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my friends, or my family.
Quite simply, I gave in to my shame.
JOE KLEIN:
It's almost as if all of this was just too easy for him.
It's almost as if he had to set up these barriers that he could then leap across, or stagger across, but get across in any event, always.
I'm going to give you this election back.
And if you'll give it to me, I won't be like George Bush.
I'll never forget who gave me a second chance and I'll be there for you till the last dog dies.
And I want you to remember that.
DEE DEE MYERS:
How many second chances, right?
How many second chances does any one person deserve?
Clinton's view is as many second chances as a person is willing to try to take.
You know, I mean, as many times as you fail, don't you deserve the chance to redeem yourself?
Isn't history loaded with people who have fallen and gotten up, and fallen and gotten up, and fallen and gotten up and done great things?
We will together build a bridge to the 21st century wide enough and strong enough to take us to America's best days.
Will you do that?
MAX BRANTLEY:
There's a stick-to-itiveness about him that's just phenomenal.
An abiding belief that if he can just have enough time, he can win over just about anybody.
DAVID MARANISS:
The central repetitive theme of Bill Clinton's life is loss and recovery.
Never count him out because, always, he will find his way back.
I end tonight where it all began for me.
I still believe in a place called Hope.
MYERS:
Where does it come from?
The unwillingness to quit on himself, on the things he believed in, on the people he cared about?
He disappoints them every time on some level, but he always gets up and tries to make it better.
You know, what else can you ask from a sinner?
JOHN HARRIS:
Success, misjudgment, in some cases catastrophe, followed by comeback.
That resilience is central to who he is as a politician.
I think it's central to who he is as a man.
NARRATOR:
He would emerge from the political backwaters of Arkansas--
"like a country tornado," one newspaper wrote-- a political natural unlike anyone had seen in a generation.
But in the winter of 1992, as Bill Clinton began campaigning for president in New Hampshire, he was still a relative unknown, eager to win over voters and his young campaign staff.
JAMES CARVILLE:
It was just so clear that he was exceptionally talented politician from the kind of get-go.
How do you get the ideas we develop in America in the manufacturing jobs here?
There are literally...
CARVILLE:
His ability to adapt, his ability to walk into a room, to size up an issue, to understand...
I've never seen a candidate, I've never seen a human being who, with the most limited briefing, can understand the dimensions, the parameters, the nuances of everything of any kind of a policy or political problem.
If we had a broad-based national health policy, it would never be in anyone's interest not to hire you...
He could see six sides to the Pentagon.
All right, Bill!
NARRATOR:
In a primary field crowded with Democratic candidates,
Clinton's determination and skill quickly distinguished him from his rivals.
His aides nicknamed him after a legendary racehorse,
Secretariat.
You spent $200 on medication?
WOMAN:
Yes...
KLEIN:
There was this famous instance just before the New Hampshire primary.
A woman started talking about that she couldn't afford the drugs that she needed to survive.
And she started to cry.
And Clinton's reflex action was to get down on his knees, put his arms around her, and he's crying, too.
CLINTON:
I'm really sorry.
It isn't right, it isn't right.
MYERS:
The story that I heard from people over and over was,
"For that one moment, he looked me in the eye,
"he touched me on the arm, he listened to my story, and I felt like I was the only person in the world."
And he did it over and over and over.
And the only way you can have that moment over and over and over is if you really are interested.
NARRATOR:
Throughout New Hampshire-- in union halls, truck stops and diners--
Clinton heard stories of depressed wages and vanishing jobs, as the state and the nation struggled to emerge from a recession.
CLINTON:
Ten years ago, we had the highest wages in the world.
Now we're tenth, and we're dropping.
What else do you think we ought to do?
HAROLD ICKES:
He knew these people, knew what they were thinking, knew their concerns, and felt that government in Washington, in large measure, was just not addressing those concerns.
NARRATOR:
The mostly white, working-class voters
Clinton met in New Hampshire, like those in his own state of Arkansas, had been fleeing the Democratic Party for years.
HARRIS:
Bill Clinton knew that Democrats were not going to regain the presidency until they re-established a connection with these middle-class and lower-middle-class voters who had been attracted for various reasons to Republican politicians and to conservative ideas.
NARRATOR:
For nearly a decade, as he rose through the ranks of Democratic politics,
Clinton had been honing a message to win back these so-called "Reagan Democrats."
DICK MORRIS:
The entire thrust of the traditional Democratic Party was based on entitlements and endowments.
They would bestow money on people.
Bill Clinton's incredibly bold idea was to change the grant to a transaction--
"We'll give you something, but we demand something back."
The way he would phrase it is, "We'll give you opportunity but you have to take responsibility."
If you want the right to receive welfare benefits, you have to assume the responsibility to get educated, to have job training, and to go to work if you can do it...
MICHAEL WALDMAN:
When he went out and said,
"We need opportunity for all, but responsibility from all Americans,"
that was different from what Democrats had been saying.
NARRATOR:
Preaching his "New Democrat" message in New Hampshire,
Clinton began to catch fire.
People say I'm not a real Democrat and I say I'm against brain-dead politics in both parties.
NARRATOR:
By mid-January, he'd pulled ahead of his strongest competitors and into the lead.
Then, with just weeks to go, it all seemed to fall apart.
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton is again denying a report of an extra-marital affair.
The report is in theStar, the supermarket tabloid.
KLEIN:
The first time I heard of Gennifer Flowers was a rumor.
I mean, the rumors of him messing around were out there.
And the stories were out there.
And it was something that his handlers talked about.
You know, "How are we going to deal with this if it actually happens?"
I would like to introduce my client to you, Gennifer Flowers.
KLEIN:
At first, nobody was really that worried about it.
But then the woman appeared.
And not only did the woman appear, but she was a lounge singer.
And everybody thought, "Oh yeah, absolutely."
And she had tapes.
FLOWERS (on tape):
I didn't think it would start this quickly.
But I think, Bill, you're being naiïve if you think that these other shows like A Current Affair...
CLINTON (on tape):
I expect them to come looking into it and interview you and everything, but I just think that if everybody is on record denying it, you got no problem.
Hold on just a sec here, people.
Where'd he go?
NARRATOR:
At first, Clinton's response to the scandal was evasive...
She did call me, I never initiated any calls to her, and whenever she called me she basically wanted reassurance...
KLEIN:
There was this growing sense and skepticism in the press that this guy was just a big phony.
I mean, he was too slick.
He was too smooth, and he would lawyer answers to questions.
I said... that's not true.
Even if your name gets used, in the absence of proof, nobody can prove you're guilty, don't worry about it.
NARRATOR:
The press called him "Slick Willie," and it stuck.
KLEIN:
The general thinking was that he was dead.
Politicians didn't survive this thing.
NARRATOR:
As many began to abandon Clinton, one person rose strongly to his defense.
CAROL WILLIS:
Bill Clinton is a smart guy, a very smart guy.
But he will tell you that Hillary is much smarter than he is.
She's much tougher than he is.
She is more of a pragmatist.
If Clinton is a dreamer, Hillary is Miss Reality.
She raised him up, and said,
"Look, get that pity out of your body
"and all that defeatism out of your back
"and let's deal with this issue, and let's move on to the next issue."
NARRATOR:
At the height of the scandal, millions tuned in to see Bill Clinton answer questions on the CBS program60 Minutes.
But it was Hillary who stole the show.
You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman, standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.
I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him and I honor what he's been through, and what we've been through together, and you know, if that's not enough for people,
then heck, don't vote for him!
GAIL SHEEHY:
By praising him, defending him, attacking the press, she brought Clinton back from the dead.
REPORTER:
How do you think it went, Governor?
You think you answered the questions?
We did our best and we feel good about it.
The American people are the judges now, we're going to let them judge.
SHEEHY:
So you can see why he was so attached to her, because she had the power to save him.
NARRATOR:
The partnership of Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham began at Yale Law School in 1971.
Clinton was fresh from a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford University in England and already planning a career in politics.
Bill loved to discuss issues.
He loved to be at the center of discussions.
He, in a way, loved to perform.
He wasn't a great student.
He didn't care about being a student;
he was not there for being a student.
He was there to make connections.
Hillary was so much more obviously intellectual.
Her power was so much more disciplined than his.
She was a leader.
She was a doer.
NARRATOR:
Bill eyed Hillary for weeks before the two finally met during one of his rare visits to the library.
He was totally blown away by how confident and challenging she was.
Here he is, this tall, gorgeously handsome hick with Elvis sideburns and high-water pants.
She's the one who crosses the room, holds out her hand and says,
"If you're going to keep staring at me
"and I'm going to keep looking back at you, we better get to know each other."
HARRIS:
Bill Clinton, who always had lots of girlfriends, looked at Hillary and said,
"I've never had a girlfriend like that.
"I can't believe that somebody as smart and as virtuous as Hillary, that she wants to be with me."
Hillary looked at Bill Clinton-- outgoing, popular, successful-- and thinks,
"I can't believe that somebody like that wants to be with me."
And I think they're both kind of mystified that the other person is attracted to them.
NARRATOR:
Hillary graduated from Yale in 1973 and soon landed a coveted job in Washington with the House committee investigating the Watergate scandal.
BERNARD NUSSBAUM:
One night, she said she wanted to introduce me to somebody who's going to come up to visit her the next day, I think.
She says, "His name is Bill Clinton."
I said, "Oh, you know, what does he do?"
She said, "Well, he graduated Yale Law School and he's from Arkansas, and he's going back to Arkansas.""
I said, "Oh, well, that's fine.
What law firm is he going to?"
She said, "Oh, no, no, he's not going to go to a law firm.
He's thinking of running for office."
I said, "He just graduated Yale Law School.
What's he thinking of running for?"
"Running for Congress."
I said, "Well, it's kind of premature.
How old is he, 26, 27?"
She said, "Oh, no, no, he's going to run for Congress
"and he thinks he's going to win and I think he's going to win.
"In fact, Bernie, he's going to go past Congress.
"He's going to be a senator or a governor.
He's going to be president of the United States."
NARRATOR:
That Bill Clinton would make politics his life's work had never been in doubt to anyone who knew him.
WILLIS:
I think he was born with political ambition.
And I think that he was using every step of his life as a classroom to build the foundation to where he ultimately wanted to go.
NARRATOR:
William Jefferson Clinton was born in Hope, Arkansas, on August 19, 1946.
His mother, Virginia Cassidy, was a nurse, outgoing and vivacious;
his father, Bill Blythe, a charming traveling salesman whom he would never know.
When Virginia was six months pregnant, her husband's car flipped over on a rain-slicked highway.
The accident killed him.
"My father left me with the feeling that I had to live for two people," Clinton would write.
"If I did well enough, somehow I could make up for the life he should have had."
MARANISS:
I think that the notion of the fleeting nature of life was one of the currents of Bill Clinton's ambition from the very beginning.
He would intensely focus on how quickly life could go.
And I think that much of his urgency comes from that sensibility.
NARRATOR:
Four years after her husband's death,
Virginia married a raffish Buick salesman named Roger Clinton.
The couple moved with six-year-old Billy to Roger's hometown, Hot Springs, Arkansas.
If Hope was a sleepy Baptist town,
Hot Springs was the opposite-- a rollicking resort, attracting people from across the country to its mineral pools and gambling parlors.
Virginia took to Hot Springs as if she'd been born to it.
She was exuberant in her living.
She pushed the envelope a little bit in her dramatic makeup and hairstyles and jewelry.
She was fun.
NARRATOR:
Outwardly, Clinton enjoyed a happy, small-town American childhood.
But inside his gabled house on Park Avenue, he was leading a far more turbulent life.
His parents' relationship had deteriorated into serial affairs and screaming matches that reverberated through the thin walls.
As Roger Clinton descended into alcoholism, he grew more and more violent, beating Virginia in front of Bill and young Roger, Jr.
My life was "full of uncertainty and anger,"
Clinton would recall,
"and a dread of ever-looming violence."
MARANISS:
Most of his buddies had no clue.
They saw Bill Clinton as a happy-go-lucky guy.
They didn't see the turmoil that was raging within that family.
JOE PURVIS:
As a child of an alcoholic, there's a part of your world that is so shaken, that's filled with so much pain, that you don't want to share it with anybody.
If you wallow in it, then you're dealing with self-pity and you ruin yourself.
The only way you can really deal with it is to block it off.
NARRATOR:
Bill Clinton became adept at keeping secrets, living, he remembered,
"an external life that takes its natural course
"and an internal life where the secrets are hidden.
No one can live parallel lives with complete success."
NIGEL HAMILTON:
He decided to pretend it didn't exist.
To pretend that everything was all right.
To go to church, you know, with his Bible under his arm and be sunny and energetic and positive and simply not accept it.
NARRATOR:
With fierce enthusiasm,
Clinton threw himself into his life outside his home.
Hot Springs High had never seen anything like him.
National Merit Scholar semifinalist, first chair in the Arkansas State Band, student government leader.
By his senior year, he held so many honors that the principal barred him from running for class president.
WILLIAM CHAFE:
Bill Clinton always found himself trying to redeem and rescue his family.
Part of doing that is to sort of put yourself in the position of rescuing not just your family, but everybody, including yourself, by doing good.
NARRATOR:
By the early 1960s,
Bill Clinton's generation had a new hero.
President John F. Kennedy's youth and charisma reached all the way to Arkansas and sparked the teenager's idealism with a call to public service.
Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
STALEY:
We loved living in a time when JFK was president.
He was so young, he made public service seem accessible, so if we had ever entertained thoughts of a life in public service, he made it seem all the more possible.
NARRATOR:
In 1963, Bill Clinton traveled to Washington as a delegate to Boys Nation, a program for aspiring future leaders.
During a visit to the White House, he rushed to the front of the line to shake his idol's hand.
STALEY:
It's a moment that is just emblazoned in your mind.
To have a president of the United States look you in the eye, take your hand, speak to you... the world stops.
Bill said to me, "We will never forget that, will we?
We will never forget that."
NARRATOR:
A decade later, after leaving Arkansas to study at Georgetown, Oxford and Yale,
Clinton returned home to begin his own long march to the White House.
MARANISS:
Bill Clinton went back to Arkansas for politics, pure and simple.
He knew the people there, and he was of that place.
He could see his political future and that he was destined for something much larger than Hot Springs or Arkansas.
NARRATOR:
In his first political race at age 28,
Clinton took on a conservative Republican congressman named John Paul Hammerschmidt.
I know that I can make a big difference for our district and for our people if I can have the opportunity to serve them in Congress.
NARRATOR:
Few gave Clinton a chance to compete.
PAUL FRAY:
People are saying, "Hey, he's smart,
"but why does this guy want to be a congressman?
"He's too young, he hasn't been elected to anything, he doesn't know what he's really doing."
NARRATOR:
It wasn't just his inexperience;
many worried that in his time away,
Clinton had lost touch with Arkansas and its values.
JOHN BRUMMETT:
There always has been with him a suspicion that this guy is not to be trusted.
"This guy's too liberal for us."
And he encountered that.
But, initially in Arkansas, he just totally overpowered it with his charm, with his political skill, with his ability to connect and relate.
In this small state, politics is art and it's entertainment.
And he was the best we had seen.
(jaunty country music)
MALE AD SINGER:
♪ There's a fellow here been talking some ♪
♪ About being our next congressman ♪
♪ He's a new man, Bill Clinton is his name... ♪
NARRATOR:
For weeks on end,
Clinton drove the back roads of northwest Arkansas, sleeping on couches, waking up at dawn to catch the shift-change at nearby factories.
MALE AD SINGER:
♪ Bill Clinton's ready, he's fed up, too ♪
♪ He's a lot like me, he's a lot like you... ♪
BOBBY ROBERTS:
He's got an extra battery.
After about four or five days with him,
I was ready to go home.
I had all the fun I could stand, and he would just keep going.
We might stop at a service station or a restaurant or whatever.
He would want to meet the cooks.
He would go back in the kitchen and meet everybody back there.
He would not leave a place, I think, where he had not met everyone.
WILLIS:
Sometimes people say, "Won't this guy go home?"
Because we don't want to embarrass him by just leaving, but he won't leave!
MALE AD SINGER:
♪ Bill Clinton's ready, he's fed up too ♪
♪ He's a lot like me, he's a lot like you ♪
♪ Bill Clinton wants to get things done ♪
♪ So we're going to send him to Washington. ♪
Make Bill a U.S. congressman.
Got to get those food prices down.
You remember, and vote for that.
NARRATOR:
As Bill Clinton campaigned for Congress,
Hillary Rodham left her high-powered job in Washington and decided to follow him to Arkansas.
SHEEHY:
She could have had lots of jobs in Washington.
Instead she elects to go, not even to Little Rock, but Fayetteville, Arkansas?
You know, her friends thought she was absolutely mad.
"He's just a country lawyer.
What do you see in him?"
NARRATOR:
When Hillary arrived in Arkansas-- a Chicago-born feminist in the Deep South-- she felt unwelcomed by Bill's campaign staff.
BRANTLEY:
She had big glasses and curly hair.
She had a Midwestern accent.
She just seemed different.
There was just something about her that put people off.
FRAY:
I said, "Look, you know, we got enough problems here as it is."
She comes in here and I say,
"I don't mind her being on the inside doing everything she does because she's sharp as a tack."
But I said, "Taking her out on the road,"
I said, "that's going to create a little bit of a question."
And he said, "Why?"
And I said, "Well, she's got outcroppings
"of where she grew up in Chicago and her parents all came from Pennsylvania."
I said, "You know, she's never really overcome all of that to get involved in what we're doing here in Arkansas."
NARRATOR:
To make matters worse,
Hillary had to deal with Bill's constant womanizing.
FRAY:
I mean you got to understand, at one time, there was at least 25 women per day coming through there trying to find him.
And I'd tell them he's out on the road, you know, and they'd get out the door.
But Lord, it was bad.
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
MARLA CRIDER:
He draws women in and they are literally mesmerized by this man.
It was absolutely like fly to honey.
And he needed that.
He needed that kind of adoration.
I don't think there's any question that Hillary was hurt, whether it was me or anyone else.
NARRATOR:
Despite Bill's infidelities,
Hillary decided to stay in Arkansas and dedicate herself to their mutual goals.
A common sense of commitment to social justice, of working on improving the lives of families, of being concerned about the disenfranchised.
But ultimately all along, thinking about going to the top.
There's no question that there's a sense of the possibilities being unlimited.
The highest you can achieve, obviously, is to be president and first lady.
NARRATOR:
On October 11, 1975, the couple wed in a simple ceremony in their living room.
HARRIS:
Most of the people I know who have been around the Clintons for a long time come to the conclusion that I've come to.
The two of them are in love.
Walter Lippmann, the great columnist, said,
"Love endures when the lovers love not just each other, but love many things together."
That, I think, is the essence of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
They had a common love, which is for politics, for the game.
They love it.
It's their life.
NARRATOR:
With Hillary firmly behind him, there was no stopping Bill Clinton.
Though he narrowly lost his congressional bid, he had positioned himself as a rising star.
MARANISS:
The morning after he lost that congressional race in 1974, he was out in the town square, shaking hands again.
Every Democratic figure in the state knew that he was the next big figure in Arkansas politics.
NARRATOR:
Two years later, he was easily elected attorney general.
I think the governor of this state ought to be...
NARRATOR:
Two years after that, he ran for governor, brimming with youthful confidence and ambition.
I'm Bill Clinton, and one of the reasons I want to be governor is to make sure that every child in this state has a chance to go to kindergarten.
NARRATOR:
Clinton won with more than 60% of the vote.
CLINTON:
I believe that if you and I together can practice what we preach about government,
I know that you and I together want to do what is right for our people.
NARRATOR:
In the late 1970s, most of Arkansas was poor and undeveloped.
Bill Clinton was determined to turn that around.
MARANISS:
He did love his state.
And he knew, growing up there, how many troubles it had.
The saying in Arkansas was, "Thank God for Mississippi,"
because Mississippi ranked 50th in everything, and Arkansas 49th.
ERNIE DUMAS:
Not much had been done for 150 years in Arkansas.
Spending on education, per capita income, our highway system was one of the worst in the country.
So Bill Clinton comes in and he has all these ideas.
He's going to transform the state at once.
NARRATOR:
Feeling, as he recalled, "an urgent sense to do everything,"
Clinton and his staff took on entrenched interests in Arkansas.
He created new regulations, revamped rural health care, reorganized school districts and took on utilities.
BRANTLEY:
They were young and they were full of themselves, and they thought they could change the world.
Well, you know, and they could stop clear-cutting of timber and clean up poultry practices and those sorts of things.
And that was... that was perhaps a little overly optimistic.
NARRATOR:
Most ambitious of all was a project to fix Arkansas roads.
It was paid for by a steep hike in taxes on car licenses and was a political disaster.
Every month, 1/12 of the people of Arkansas went down to the courthouse to get their... renew their license plates for the following year, and instead of being $19, it was $36.
That became extremely unpopular, and he realized that late in the election of 1980.
He'd go early in the morning to a factory gate and all these guys refused to shake his hand.
They said, "No, you raised my truck tag, and I'm not going to vote for you."
NARRATOR:
After one term, Clinton ran for reelection against an obscure Republican businessman named Frank White, who pounded away at Clinton's youth and arrogance.
He tells you he can create jobs-- he's never had a job!
NARRATOR:
To Clinton's dismay, White's tactic worked.
CLINTON:
I regret that I will not have two more years to serve as governor, because I have loved it.
I have probably loved it as much as any person who ever had this office.
(applause)
NARRATOR:
Since he was a teenager,
Bill Clinton had prepared himself to be president.
Now, just 34, with his new baby Chelsea to support, he feared his political career might already be over.
BRUMMETT:
He took it incredibly hard.
He knew those folks and he thought they loved him, and it turned out they didn't.
He was totally out of sorts.
And when you see him, he wants to talk about one thing.
"What'd I do wrong?"
That's... you see him at the Forest Heights track, where he's jogging.
"Hey, let me talk to you.
What did I do wrong?"
See him in the aisle at the grocery store,
"What'd I do wrong?"
One day, I'm driving from the state capitol back to theArkansas Gazette to... pass him walking along the street, and I rolled down the window, and I said, "Where you going?"
And he said, "Car is in the shop down here at Bale Chevrolet."
I said, "I'll give you a ride."
He hops in.
We drive three blocks, but then we just park in front of there and we talk for 45 minutes, about what?
"What did I do wrong?"
MARANISS:
Hillary was as devastated by that defeat as Bill was and as determined to make amends and figure out a way back.
I mean, here she had devoted her life and given up a lot to go out to Arkansas for their rise together.
And at this very early age, it seemed like it was all vulnerable.
So she was not going to allow that to happen.
NARRATOR:
Hillary traded in her thick glasses for contact lenses and her unkempt hair for a fashionable blonde bob.
To quiet some of her critics, she took her husband's last name.
RODHAM CLINTON:
And just to put it to rest,
I will forever be known as Hillary Rodham Clinton.
NARRATOR:
Frustrated by what she regarded as poor advice, she took over her husband's reelection campaign.
DUMAS:
Hillary was the mastermind in that comeback.
Most of his people advised him at the time,
"Don't run again, wait two years."
Hillary says, "You can come back and you can do it again."
He didn't trust himself as much as he trusted her.
NARRATOR:
Determined never to lose again,
Clinton studied the results of his defeat precinct by precinct.
He resolved to win back every single one.
Hi, Judge, how are you?
Congratulations.
BRUMMETT:
I remember one day, we leave Fayetteville in a little plane and a storm is coming in.
And he said, "Fly fast,"
because we can see the cloud coming in behind us.
By the time we get 20 minutes away to the mountain town of Harrison, the pilot says,
"Can't put it down.
Fog is too thick."
"Got to," says Clinton, "got to.
"I understand from the office that I got 150 people there.
I've got a chance to get some votes here."
I'm sitting across from him thinking, "This is it.
"I'm going to die,
"and I'm going to be the last paragraph of the obituary, after all, about him."
He says, "This is going to get hairy.
I'm going to sleep."
And he leans back and appears to go to sleep.
And the third time, we made it.
And before the plane stops taxiing, he opens the door and jumps out, because he's already an hour late.
That's madness.
NEWSCASTER:
The crowd has waited, they're ready to celebrate.
It's been a long two years.
If victory is ours tonight,
I have been given something that few people get in life:
a second chance to serve the people of Arkansas.
(applause)
NARRATOR:
Clinton had learned from his mistakes.
Rather than take on every problem in Arkansas with his second term, he narrowed his focus to a single issue that he knew would serve the people and his political future:
education.
I still believe that until we have a system which guarantees competence in basic learning skills, we will never be able to prepare our people for a higher level of achievements.
I don't care what else we do.
(applause)
BRUMMETT:
It's a winning issue.
The people are willing to go that way.
And it's something we can get done if we focus on that.
He has settled on the strategy.
Now, who's the right person?
Who's my point person?
Hillary.
RODHAM CLINTON:
We know it's a huge task, but we're very optimistic that we're going to be able to make a substantial improvement in what our students receive.
BRANTLEY:
She went from town to town all over Arkansas and met with civic groups and PTAs and school groups and talked about what they wanted to do about improving schools in Arkansas.
By the time it was over,
I think she was one of the most popular people in the state.
DUMAS:
One legislator popped up at a hearing one day and said,
"We elected the wrong Clinton."
ROBERTS:
It just resurrected him.
He needed a success and it made him the education governor at a time when education was a vital issue in the country.
And he was able to use that to open all kinds of doors for him.
NARRATOR:
Over the next few years, Clinton began to catch the attention of the media and national Democratic leaders desperate to find a candidate who could loosen Republicans' grip on the presidency.
MORRIS:
He would spend a huge amount of time meeting with, impressing and charming his fellow governors and other elected officials.
And after a day and a night with him, talking about philosophy and politics, you came away with the impression this was the smartest guy in the class, and that essentially if you were going to have a president,
it probably should be this guy.
NARRATOR:
In 1987, during his fourth term as Arkansas governor,
Bill Clinton was finally ready to leap onto the national stage with a long-shot run for the presidency.
(applause)
In July, he summoned the national media to Little Rock for the big announcement.
Then, abruptly, he sent them home with hardly an explanation.
I need some family time, I need some personal time.
NARRATOR:
Behind the scenes, an old weakness had come back to haunt him.
SHEEHY:
Just the day before the press conference, when he was going to announce that he was going to run,
Betsey Wright, his ferociously protective campaign manager, sat him down with a list of names of women and went through one after the other:
how many times, where did you meet her, how likely is she to talk?
HAMILTON:
For each name, he said, "Oh, she'll never say anything."
And Betsey Wright said, "But you don't know that.
"You don't understand, on a national scale,
"people will investigate... your opponents will investigate it.
The media will investigate it."
"The problem is, we're not just talking about you.
"We're talking about your wife, Hillary;
we're talking about your child, Chelsea."
She said, "I don't think you can run."
I mean, it just became clear that night it was not the time for him to do it.
It just was not the time.
He felt for quite a while that that probably was the last real chance he would ever have to run for president.
That was it, it was over.
You know, where would he go now that he wasn't going to run for president?
What could he do in the future?
I think that, over the next few months, that became a tough time for them.
NARRATOR:
With Hillary and Bill's mutual dream in tatters, thanks to his extramarital affairs, their relationship hit rock bottom.
SHEEHY:
It did put into question their whole marriage.
And it was very unnerving to Hillary because she had put everything on the line for him to pursue the presidency.
And if he had too much of a record of reckless behavior to do that, then what had she been doing for the last 15 years?
MAN:
It is now time to place the name in nomination for president of the United States, Michael Dukakis.
(cheering)
NARRATOR:
Just when it seemed things couldn't get worse,
Clinton was asked to give the speech nominating Michael Dukakis at the 1988 Democratic convention.
CLINTON:
I'm honored to be here tonight to nominate my friend Michael Dukakis for president of the United States.
HARRY THOMASON:
That piece was supposed to be the set piece to launch him on the national stage, and it turned out to be something that almost killed his career before it got started.
And I'd like to talk a little about Mike Dukakis, the man...
WILLIS:
The speech was going on and on and on.
Mike's old-fashioned, all right.
He's the kind of man who plays it straight and keeps his word.
We want Mike!
WILLIS:
The crowd was just getting restless.
And we said, "Oh, man, we dead," right?
He was going by the script that the Dukakis folks has approved.
And he has to carry it out.
Now, I want you all to calm down so I can tell the rest of the country why they should want Mike.
BRANTLEY:
Of course, the famous thing was when he said,
"In conclusion," he got a round of applause, finally.
In closing... (cheering)
THOMASON:
Linda, my wife, and I are at our house and we're looking on in disbelief.
Sometime in the wee hours, Linda wakes me up, and she says,
"Look, he's got to go on the Carson show to make this right."
My first question is, "How are you?"
(laughter and applause)
I'm fine.
I watched the speech, and as a performer, I kind of felt for you in a way.
What happened?
It just didn't work, I mean,
I don't know, what can I tell you?
I really... my sole goal was achieved, however.
I wanted so badly to make Michael Dukakis look great and I succeeded beyond my wildest expectations.
THOMASON:
In an instant, he had turned it around, because the next day, papers were full of good things and had kind things to say about him.
And so it erased almost all of it in one day and made him more visible than he had ever been.
It's tenor sax you play, right?
That's right.
We're going to play a short song.
(laughter)
WRIGHT:
He recovers better than anybody I have ever known.
It's extraordinary.
(playing jazzy tune)
I mean, he can have horrible things crash down upon his head, but he crawls out from under it and keeps on going.
NARRATOR:
Bill and Hillary Clinton were back on the map.
Having faced a crossroads in their personal and political lives, they decided that whatever the costs, they would stay together and continue to pursue the goal they'd shared for 20 years:
the presidency of the United States.
Four years later, in the snows of New Hampshire,
Clinton held a comfortable lead in the Democratic primary.
With the Gennifer Flowers scandal behind him, he was campaigning with the confidence of a frontrunner.
"Unless a second shoe drops to indicate he's a liar,"
declared theNew York Times,
"Clinton has emerged more clearly as the Democrats' likely nominee."
But just 12 days before the primary, the second shoe not only dropped, it nearly shattered the campaign.
An old letter had surfaced, written by Bill Clinton more than 20 years earlier when facing the possibility of being drafted to fight in Vietnam.
In the letter, Clinton thanked his local ROTC commander,
Colonel Eugene Holmes, for "saving me from the draft."
Though he never took the deferment,
Clinton's letter sounded to many like the confession of a draft dodger and sparked a second round of attacks against his character.
CARVILLE:
The Friday story in the Wall Street Journal appears about the ROTC and Colonel Holmes and the polling numbers just started collapsing.
REPORTER:
Governor, are you a draft dodger?
Did you burn your draft card?
No, I had a lock-cinch four-year deferment.
I gave it up after less than two months because I didn't think it was right.
I went back into the draft, then this lottery came along.
I got a high number and I wasn't called.
MYERS:
Stan Greenberg, our pollster, came in and said,
"The bottom's fallen out."
You know, we dropped 18 points in a weekend and we didn't have that many points to start with.
Of course I've had some problems in the polls.
All I've been asked about by the press are a woman I didn't sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge.
MYERS:
I think a lot of us thought, you know, "This is over."
But I mean, Clinton...
Clinton, he never flinched.
You know, he willed himself back into that race.
How you doing?
I need your help!
NARRATOR:
For the next week, Clinton campaigned 20 hours a day, pushing himself to the limits of his endurance.
CLINTON:
I don't have another speech in me.
I can barely talk.
We have to reject the political philosophy that gripped this country in the 1980s...
NARRATOR:
With only days left, his voice ragged,
Clinton spoke at an Elks Lodge in Dover, New Hampshire.
JONATHAN ALTER:
These were Yankees who had been really beaten down by the loss of manufacturing jobs in that part of the country, and they didn't seem to have other opportunities.
I'll tell you something,
I'm going to give you this election back, and if you'll give it to me, I won't be like George Bush.
I'll never forget who gave me a second chance and I'll be there for you till the last dog dies.
And I want you to remember that.
"I'll be there for you till the last dog dies."
And we knew we'd seen one of those astonishing political performances.
I don't promise you a miracle, I promise you a movement.
Let's take our country back, and see this country win again.
Thank you very much and God bless you!
MYERS:
How many second chances, right?
How many second chances does any one person deserve?
Clinton's view is as many second chances as a person is willing to try to take.
You know, I mean, as many times as you fail, don't you deserve the chance to redeem yourself?
Isn't history loaded with people who have fallen and gotten up, and fallen and gotten up, and fallen and gotten up, and done great things?
You know, who's to say?
Bill Clinton.
You've definitely got my support.
Thank you.
I need you tomorrow, thanks.
NARRATOR:
On Feb. 18, the voters of New Hampshire went to the polls.
Despite the one-two punch of Gennifer Flowers and the draft,
Clinton finished a strong second behind former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas.
Let me say that while the evening is young... (laughter) and we don't know yet what the final tally will be,
I think we know enough to say with some certainty that New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the "Comeback Kid."
(cheering)
NARRATOR:
In the weeks to come,
Clinton rolled up primary victory after primary victory.
In Florida, in Tennessee, in Mississippi...
NARRATOR:
In early June, he surpassed the number of delegates needed for the Democratic nomination by winning the California primary.
The election for America's future begins tomorrow.
It is not about me, it's about all of you.
Even though he's winning voters over and winning these primaries with bigger and bigger margins, the news coverage, you know, for the general electorate, is one of a politician you would never make president of the United States.
You could not possibly trust this guy.
The polls would ask the question whether he has the honesty and character to be president.
The numbers got worse and worse and worse.
Now we reached a point where we said, "We can't just allow that
"to be the narrative through to the convention.
Let's restore the sense of trust."
NARRATOR:
A team of top campaign aides planned a complete overhaul of Clinton's image, culminating in a nostalgic film shown during the Democratic National Convention in New York.
It was called "A Man From Hope."
CLINTON:
I was born in a little town called Hope, Arkansas, three months after my father died.
I remember living in that old two-story house where I lived with my grandparents...
ICKES:
The film, I think, brought people back,
"Okay, here's who this guy is.
"Here's what we're really about, and we really have a strong candidate."
(crowd cheering)
CROWD:
We want Bill!
We want Bill!
CLINTON:
My fellow Americans,
I end tonight where it all began for me.
I still believe in a place called hope.
God bless you, and God bless America.
NARRATOR:
With a rock anthem from the 1970s as the campaign theme song,
Clinton staffers positioned their candidate as the young, dynamic face of a new generation.
To complete the image,
Clinton chose as his running mate the youthful senator from Tennessee, Al Gore.
MYERS:
It turned the conventional wisdom on its head.
He believed you don't dilute your message, you put a big underline and exclamation point and this is a new generation, new ideas, a new Democratic party.
Totally energized the general election campaign.
FLEETWOOD MAC:
♪ Don't stop thinking about tomorrow ♪
♪ Don't stop, it will soon be here... ♪
NARRATOR:
Heading into the fall,
Clinton had surged ahead of President George H.W. Bush and third-party candidate Ross Perot.
With the economy still faltering,
Clinton had found his issue and his voice.
The crowd that's running Washington today has had 12 years to test their economic theory, and it's failed.
NARRATOR:
The decisive event came in mid-October, at the second presidential debate in Richmond, Virginia, when Clinton turned a question from the audience into a defining political moment.
WALDMAN:
A woman stood up and asked a question that was on a lot of people's minds.
WOMAN:
How has the national debt personally affected each of your lives?
And if it hasn't, how can you honestly find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience in what's ailing them?
And President Bush said,
"I don't get it, I don't get the question."
Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?
I'm not sure I get it.
Help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.
KLEIN:
Clinton understood that she wasn't talking about the deficit or the debt.
What she was talking about was the economy.
And the recession.
And the body language was absolutely crucial at that point.
He took two steps toward her.
Tell me how it's affected you again?
You know people who've lost their jobs and lost their homes.
WOMAN:
Uh-huh.
Well, I'll tell you how it's affected me.
I see people in my state, middle-class people, their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.
I have seen what's happened in this last four years when, in my state, when people lose their jobs, there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.
KLEIN:
That was giving the American public precisely what they wanted at that point.
They had this brilliant foreign policy president.
What they needed was someone who cared about them and who was as scared about the economy as they were.
And in that moment, he encapsulated that.
I think what we have to do is invest in American jobs,
American education.
KLEIN:
He was on his way to winning.
But that was the deal closer.
He closed the deal.
NARRATOR:
Like a marathon runner nearing the finish line,
Clinton spent the final 24 hours of the campaign in an all-out sprint, touching down in nine states.
His voice gone, he could only wave at adoring crowds.
TOM BROKAW:
Sometime during the course of this half hour, the man who liked to call himself the "Comeback Kid,"
Bill Clinton of a town called Hope in Arkansas, will be projected the winner of the presidential candidacy of 1992.
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton.
STALEY:
It was just unbelievable.
Such a moment of pride, happiness.
It felt like we had a new opportunity to seize the day for America with fresh ideas from a man who had the right heart, the right spirit, loved service and could face anything that life was about to throw at him.
My fellow Americans, on this day, with high hopes and brave hearts, in massive numbers, the American people have voted to make a new beginning.
DAVID GERGEN:
There was this joy and buoyancy and he had so much promise about him.
Those of us who believed in Bill Clinton, and I did, had a sense of, "Wow, this is going to be really, really good for the country."
NARRATOR:
After 20 years of thrilling highs and gut-wrenching falls,
Bill and Hillary had at last achieved their highest goal.
But if they had won the presidency, the Clintons had yet to win over the country.
And in this moment of triumph, few could imagine the turmoil that lay ahead.
WALDMAN:
He got 43% of the vote, but none of us thought about that.
To us, it felt like a landslide.
Clinton believed in a strong government;
he wanted to be a big president.
He revered Kennedy, he revered Roosevelt, he thought about the heroic presidents and he wanted to use the presidency that way.
But the country was turning away from government, it was skeptical that government could work, and there were these rolling undercurrents of anger that we knew were there, but we didn't realize how they could quickly consume even us.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States of America,
William Jefferson Clinton.
NARRATOR:
On a crisp January morning in 1993,
Bill Clinton took the oath of office as the 42nd president of the United States.
Promising a new start, he sounded the themes of change and optimism that had won him the White House.
Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world, but the engine of our own renewal.
There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.
GERGEN:
He did have heroic visions of what he might do as president.
He felt that the winds of change were blowing heavily at his back and that he could ride them to great, magnificent victories.
The harder reality was that he only won with 43% of the vote in a three-man race, and that's not exactly a heady mandate for governing.
NARRATOR:
Clinton's victory had come despite a deep divide in the country.
Millions had responded to his campaign message of change.
But millions of others feared where the country was heading and did not trust their inexperienced new president to lead them through uncertain times.
HARRIS:
There was a group of people who had a visceral dislike for Bill Clinton.
They felt that he had stayed just one step ahead of the posse with his personal problems.
They thought that he represented a 1960s generation that was always trying to pull a fast one and not playing by traditional rules.
They despised him and thought there was something illegitimate about his presidency.
LUCIANNE GOLDBERG:
There's a sense of him being a used car salesman.
There's a sense of a guy being a charming hick.
He was loathed because, in the first place,
I think we've all known somebody like Bill Clinton and we don't want them to be president of our country.
And the wife was terrifying as well.
She was pushy, she was humorless, she couldn't get her hair figured out.
There were just so many things about Hillary that we didn't like.
NARRATOR:
Despite all their education and experience, the Clintons were unprepared for their reception in Washington.
MIKE McCURRY:
He still labored under the assumption that he could bring people together through power of persuasion.
It was stunning to him that Republicans would just very blatantly tell him,
"We're not here to cooperate with you
"and this is going to be open warfare from the very beginning."
GERGEN:
It's a big leap, from the state capital to the nation's capital and to the world's capital, and the Clintons found that Washington was a shock for them.
The rules were very different, people weren't as friendly, people had other agendas, a lot of knives were out, people played behind curtains, you just never knew what was going to come out and strike you.
DIRECTOR:
90 seconds.
Is there a teleprompter?
What are we going to do about the teleprompter?
LAWRENCE O'DONNELL:
He had no comprehension of the rules of the road in Washington.
No governor ever elected to the presidency has ever understood what they were getting into.
And he looked more unprepared than most.
Wait a minute, how long are you going to have to...
O'DONNELL:
His first address from the Oval Office, sitting behind the desk, it looked like a big mistake had happened and some little kid had been allowed in there with his $12 digital watch.
Everything about him suggested he was not up to this.
NARRATOR:
Clinton ran his White House as if it were an extension of the campaign, filling his staff with 30-year-olds with little Washington experience.
He wanted to be part of the hurly-burly, to hear every opinion, weigh in on every decision.
REICH:
The atmosphere in the White House in that first year was chaos.
He wanted to do everything.
He wanted to deal with every problem.
He was in the middle of every conflict.
They would have these college bull sessions that would go on, you know, late into the night.
The meetings were endless, especially if Clinton was in the meeting, it would go on and on and on.
HARRIS:
He was often thinking out loud, making decisions on the fly, making a decision tentatively at midnight and then waking up the next morning and saying,
"Let's rethink this."
NARRATOR:
The West Wing was littered with pizza boxes and Coke cans, as staffers wandered freely in and out of meetings.
KLEIN:
It wasn't the kind of orderly process that Republicans brought to the table.
It was all these discordant voices, informal voices, people who didn't even wear ties and jackets when they went into the Oval Office, my God!
MYERS:
You've got to be a little grand.
Because the American people want it.
It's the biggest job in the world, and I think we underestimated that.
People felt like, "What is it, a fraternity house over there?"
NARRATOR:
As Clinton took office in the winter of 1993, the economic crisis that had propelled him into office showed few signs of abating.
ROBERT RUBIN:
We had had a recession.
We had high unemployment.
And it was a lot of uncertainty about whether the United States was going to get on its feet again or whether we could be in for a long period of real difficulty.
So he came into a very difficult environment.
NARRATOR:
During the transition, Clinton had promised to focus on the economy "like a laser beam."
But he quickly discovered how easily his focus could be deflected by an unscripted comment to a reporter.
REPORTER:
Do you intend to keep your commitment to lift the ban on gays in the military?
Yes.
I want to...
I have... you know what my issue on this is:
number one, we've got a study that says that a lot of gays have performed with great distinction in the military.
I don't think status alone in the absence of some destructive behavior should disqualify people.
Now, Bill Clinton, with his wits about him, would have said,
"Oh, yes, I'm going to stick to my campaign pledge
"and in furtherance of that,
"we're going to appoint a blue-ribbon commission that will report back to my successor 100 years from now."
But he didn't.
He just said the first part.
You know, "I'm going to keep my campaign pledge."
And all of a sudden, the laser-like focus on the economy was derailed to a, you know, a lurid issue in the minds of many people.
REPORTER:
Mr. President, would you consider backing down on your... the ban on gays in the military?
We haven't... we're not here to discuss that.
We're here to discuss the economy, which is all I discussed yesterday with congressional leadership, contrary to the press reports.
REPORTER:
But would you consider...
We're here to discuss the economy.
NARRATOR:
Trapped by his own promise,
Clinton attempted to lift the ban, but ran into heavy resistance from two allies:
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell and Democratic senator Sam Nunn.
MYERS:
So, you have the military leadership bucking him, the Democratic congressional leaders, led by, you know, chairman of the Armed Services Committee saying, "No,"
and the president is powerless to do anything about it.
And so he's now put into a position where he has to try to negotiate some kind of a resolution to this that will save face.
Therefore, the practice, now six months old...
NARRATOR:
After weeks of fruitless wrangling,
Clinton announced a compromise-- "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"-- that few could even understand.
An open statement by a service member that he or she is a homosexual will create a rebuttable presumption that he or she intends to engage in prohibited conduct, but the service member will be given an opportunity to refute that presumption.
MYERS:
Nobody was particularly happy with "Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"
but it was the best that you could do to get it off the table so you could move on.
NARRATOR:
Other capitulations quickly followed.
He dropped a stimulus bill and campaign finance reform in the face of congressional opposition.
REICH:
It became very apparent very soon that Bill Clinton as president was not going to be an LBJ.
He was not going to assert his authority, make deals, crack heads, push his weight around, say to any members of Congress in the leadership that,
"If you don't follow me, you're going to pay for this,
"because I'm going to remember it.
You're not going to get this, you're not going to get that."
You know, LBJ knew how to use power.
Bill Clinton knew much of that, but he also wanted to be liked.
NARRATOR:
When attorney general nominee Zoe Baird got into hot water over her failure to pay taxes for household help,
Clinton hardly put up a fight.
NUSSBAUM:
The first day I was in the White House, the president said to me,
"We're having problems with Zoe Baird."
To me this is a big deal, personally, and I suspect it is to a lot of Americans...
NUSSBAUM:
He says, "Well, I'm hearing from Democratic senators
"that it's really going to be a problem, and the press is on my back."
My position was, "Look, you've already nominated her, she's an excellent person, we should stick with Zoe Baird."
And he decided, "No."
I feel very badly about it, but I'm responsible for it and I'm going to start this afternoon looking for an attorney general.
NUSSBAUM:
In order to placate the opposing party's criticisms and media criticisms, which began on day one, the Clinton administration kept folding, kept giving in.
I think that undermined his presidency.
It showed he could be rolled.
NARRATOR:
The media, which had embraced Clinton during the campaign, now began to turn on him.
When his nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsberg to the Supreme Court took a tortuous course, reporters pounced.
REPORTER:
Your turn late, it seems, to Judge Ginsberg may have created an impression, perhaps unfair, of a certain zigzag quality in the decision-making process here.
I wonder, sir, if you could kind of walk us through it, perhaps disabuse us of any notion we might have along those lines.
Thank you.
I have long since given up the thought that I could disabuse some of you of turning any substantive decision into anything but political process.
How you could ask a question like that after the statement she just made is beyond me.
(applause)
HARRIS:
What he wanted people to do, "Just look at the result.
Did I make a good decision or not?"
But as president, every decision that Bill Clinton makes, and not just the decisions but how he makes these decisions, is receiving merciless scrutiny.
The messiness of the process became part of the story, and Bill Clinton found it maddening.
NARRATOR:
The Clintons arrived in Washington in the midst of a media revolution.
The advent of cable television and the 24-hour news cycle created an insatiable appetite for colorful coverage of Washington.
KLEIN:
Cable television was beginning to become a force.
And the competition among cable news became a vicious fact of Bill Clinton's life.
Sex sold.
Corruption sold.
NARRATOR:
Throughout the spring of 1993, a series of scandals, including "Travelgate" and "Hairgate," flared in the press.
Hillary found it hard to shrug off the negative press.
Stories, like the one alleging that she broke a lamp during a heated argument with the president, embarrassed and humiliated her.
"I've always believed in a zone of privacy," she said,
"but I guess I've been rezoned."
SHEEHY:
She had an agenda, changes in the country, in the world, that she wanted to see done.
She couldn't understand why the media was focusing constantly on their private life.
But the more she fought it, the more she drew attention to it.
NARRATOR:
The lawyer chosen to lead the Clintons' defense was their close friend and deputy White House counsel
Vince Foster.
NUSSBAUM:
Vince, he got very upset with the attacks.
He felt we couldn't stop these attacks, and yes, no, we couldn't stop these attacks.
You know, this is the nature of the game down here.
This is the partisan game down here.
And I kept trying to calm him down.
But I did see him getting sadder and sadder.
And then... then that day came when he took his own life.
NARRATOR:
On the afternoon of July 20, Vince Foster told an assistant that he was going out for a few minutes.
That evening, his body was found in a secluded park ten miles from the White House, a bullet hole through his head.
A torn-up note was found a few days later at the bottom of Foster's briefcase.
"I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington," it read.
"Here, ruining people is considered sport."
GERGEN:
I was very concerned that, knowing how close Vince Foster was to both Bill and Hillary, that it would be sort of the final straw for Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in Washington.
They would just think, "This town's impossible."
You know, "We've lost one of our best friends.
He's taken his life in the midst of this melee."
And that something very intangible would be lost.
Bill Clinton's one of the most resilient people I've ever met.
The pain goes deeper with Hillary, and it can stay there longer.
She's strong, but she's also vulnerable.
NARRATOR:
Far from destroying the Clintons,
Foster's death steeled them against their adversaries.
For Hillary, there could be no more illusions:
this would be a war with only one winner.
NUSSBAUM:
They were toughening up by this time.
They were seeing now that we're in a blood sport, that people are trying to kill you and nothing is going to make them happy.
NARRATOR:
Foster's suicide only fueled the media's fascination with scandal.
Within days of the discovery of his body, there was speculation about the "real cause" of his death.
KEN GORMLEY:
The immediate reaction to Vince Foster's death was,
"What happened here, and were the Clintons involved?
Were they covering something up?"
There begins bubbling up this notion that there's a conspiracy, that Vince Foster's been murdered.
You know, on one account, his body rolled up in a rug, he's having an affair with Hillary-- all of these terrible things.
NARRATOR:
Attention focused mostly on some files mysteriously removed from Foster's office after his death, including documents related to an old Arkansas land deal:
Whitewater.
Whitewater-- the scandal that would haunt Clinton's presidency longer than any other-- had its roots in the late 1970s.
At the time, Bill Clinton was a young attorney general making just over $25,000 a year.
Hillary, an associate at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, was the family's main breadwinner.
When an old friend named Jim McDougal approached her with a plan to build vacation homes along the White River,
Hillary decided to invest.
PURVIS:
Here's a guy, McDougal, that comes to him and says,
"Put a little money into this thing."
He said, "Boy, you'll be rich and you'll make money, and this is going to be great."
Well, I guess in hindsight, every person promoting any sort of land scheme thinks it's going to be a world-beater and we're going to be rich as Midas by the time it's over.
NARRATOR:
Like many of McDougal's real estate projects,
Whitewater went belly-up.
To prop up his scheme, he made illegal transfers from his own savings and loan,
Madison Guaranty.
McDougal was charged with fraud.
President Clinton, you just mentioned James McDougal, your former business partner.
A lot of questions have been raised about his business practices.
NARRATOR:
Fifteen years later, President Clinton was asked by reporters what he and Hillary knew about McDougal's illegal activities.
To the best of my knowledge, he was honest in his dealings with me, and that's all I can comment on.
ICKES:
The White House was totally unprepared for it.
There was no memo on it, there was no defense group.
I had nothing to do with the management of Whitewater.
Hillary had nothing to do with it.
We didn't keep the books or the records.
ICKES:
There were some of us who said,
"Keep the walls up, keep it back," you know.
"It's none of their business, uh, nothing happened.
"It's a little deal down in Arkansas that has nothing to do with the presidency, and it'll go away."
It didn't go away, but that built up a suspicion, and as new things leaked out, as inconsequential as they might be, the press would say,
"Oh, the Clintons have been hiding stuff."
And there was built up relatively quickly that the Clintons were just stonewalling.
NARRATOR:
The emergence of the Whitewater scandal couldn't have come at a worse time for President Clinton.
In the late summer of 1993, he needed broad political support, as his first major piece of legislation-- the federal budget-- was headed for a showdown in Congress.
REICH:
We knew that if Bill Clinton lost that vote, the signal would be, he can't get the Democrats in the House and the Senate to go along with him.
That means he doesn't have power.
That's the definition of lacking power.
And if this early in the administration our new president lacks power, where do we go next?
NARRATOR:
Abandoning his campaign promise to cut taxes and invest in the middle class, Clinton instead took the advice of the administration's deficit hawks to reduce spending and raise taxes.
KLEIN:
Bill Clinton's first big decision was an intellectual act of faith.
CLINTON:
We're on the eve of historic action.
Without deficit reduction, we can't have sustained economic growth.
KLEIN:
He gambled in the midst of a recession that he'd get more economic growth if he was fiscally conservative, and if he began to reduce the deficit that would convince the bond market to start reducing interest rates and the economy would grow.
That was just a theory.
No one knew it would work.
NARRATOR:
More than anything,
Clinton had wanted to invest in the middle class.
The realization that he couldn't left him deeply disappointed.
HARRIS:
He didn't become president to say no.
He didn't become president to administer pain.
He didn't become president because he wanted to placate Wall Street.
But, in fact, his agenda did require, to some extent, doing all those things.
NARRATOR:
As the budget reached Congress,
Clinton knew it was on a knife-edge.
With Republicans unanimously opposed, the president needed nearly every Democratic vote to pass the bill, but the party, like the administration, was in disarray.
Liberal Democrats complained about the cuts in spending, while conservatives opposed the tax hikes.
DAVID BOREN:
I think that the president will fail, the party will fail, and the country will fail if we enact this budget.
NARRATOR:
Faced with the possibility of a catastrophic defeat,
Clinton got down to work.
"I knew if I didn't get the economy going," he said,
"nothing else would matter."
There wasn't anything he wasn't willing to do.
He would call, he would meet.
He would grovel, he would strong-arm.
He would use every tactic any leader has at his disposal to try to get this thing done.
NARRATOR:
But the days when a president could command votes, even from members of his own party, were long over.
LEON PANETTA:
Bill Clinton was used to Arkansas.
You know, he knew the good old boys, he knew who he had to go to.
He could walk on the floor of the legislature and basically, you know, with a smile and a pat on the back he could get any vote he wanted.
That wasn't true, here in Washington.
And in many ways it was frustrating for him because he really felt that he knew what was best for the country and that by the sheer power of his personality and his words and his smile, that somehow he could make it work.
NARRATOR:
The budget wended its way through a series of committee and floor votes in the House and Senate.
GREENBERG:
We went to some of these votes not having the votes.
Getting calls during the voting process that someone had turned, someone had moved, these things are being won by one vote.
Imagine that.
This is the budget, this is like his entire presidency goes down if he fails, and you're up to one vote each time.
NARRATOR:
In early August, the final budget bill reached the floor of the House.
With the vote still in doubt, all eyes turned to a freshman Democrat from an historically Republican district,
Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky.
PANETTA:
We had her down as voting yes, and she votes no early on.
And so we said,
"Go in there, find out what the hell's going on, try to turn her vote around."
First of all, as a former member, if you're going to vote against the leadership, vote and get the hell out of there.
She didn't do that, she stayed there.
So suddenly these guys are all pouring on her, and she's standing there, and they're saying,
"Come on, you've got to change your vote.
This is important to the administration."
She then says something like,
"I'll do this, but the president has to come into my district."
So they call me, back in the office, and they say,
"Will the president come into her district to do..."
And I said, "Absolutely!
Whatever it takes, we're going to do it."
NARRATOR:
With the vote and his presidency on the line,
Clinton paced nervously in a small office in the West Wing.
RUBIN:
We're all crowded around this little television set, really with quite a high level of uncertainty.
NARRATOR:
Finally, Mezvinsky cast her vote "yes," and the budget passed.
With an equally narrow victory in the Senate,
Clinton's final budget became law.
Not even he foresaw the economic boom it would set off.
RUBIN:
It contributed enormously to what turned out to be the longest economic expansion in the nation's history.
22 million new jobs were created, productivity went up.
Incomes rose at all levels.
And, for the first time in 30 years, we had a federal surplus.
NARRATOR:
By the fall of 1993, there were glimmers of a turnaround in Clinton's fortunes.
After passing his budget,
Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement with overwhelming Republican support.
The same month, he signed the Brady Bill, instituting background checks for anyone purchasing a firearm.
NAFTA and Brady culminated ten months of intense focus on domestic affairs, but beyond America's shores, a troubled world would wait no longer for the president's attention.
(explosions, gunfire)
RICHARD CLARKE:
The Cold War had kept a lot of tensions quiet and a lot of groups quiet.
And now, with that over, all of the old animosities, all of the old hatreds-- ethnic hatreds, regional tensions that had been under that iceberg of the Cold War-- were now popping out and were real problems.
KLEIN:
How much did the United States want to get involved in problems in the rest of the world, which tended to be localized problems?
Were those worthy of our time and attention?
This was uncharted territory.
CLARKE:
We were all reaching for, all searching for some new grand unifying theory.
Give us a new way of looking at the world.
NARRATOR:
Clinton had little to offer in the realm of foreign affairs.
The first president since World War II who had not worn a military uniform, he lacked confidence as a commander-in-chief.
KLEIN:
Clinton came to the White House with very little knowledge of the U.S. military.
Famously, he didn't even know how to salute.
To a great many people in this country, that was legitimately something to be worried about.
NARRATOR:
Clinton's first major foreign policy crisis came in the African nation of Somalia, where a warlord named Mohamed Farah Aidid was terrorizing the local population in an effort to suppress his opponents in a civil war.
Clinton inserted U.S. Special Forces into Somalia to capture Aidid.
During a mission on October 3, two Blackhawk helicopters were shot down.
American forces sent in to assist were pinned down by overwhelming firepower.
Before they could be extracted, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed with 84 more wounded.
Around the world, images of a dead American soldier being dragged through the streets enflamed public opinion.
HARRIS:
Although George H.W. Bush had initiated that intervention, it had expanded on Bill Clinton's watch.
So when things turned bad, it was hugely unpopular, and Bill Clinton bore the brunt of that.
KOFI ANNAN:
You need to understand the average citizen.
In their minds, we have gone there on a humanitarian mission to offer a helping hand, and we get attacked and humiliated.
"Why are we there?
"Why should we continue to help?
"Why are you keeping the boys there?
Bring the boys home."
That sort of political pressure that President Clinton and his team had to deal with.
NARRATOR:
The backlash in public opinion contained what seemed a clear lesson for the young president:
military intervention, without a compelling national interest, came with unforeseeable risks and costs.
HARRIS:
It sent a chill through the administration and made them much more reluctant to intervene in other parts of the world.
And where that came home in the most profound way, and one that Bill Clinton came to deeply, deeply regret, was in Rwanda.
NARRATOR:
Rwanda, an African nation a thousand miles to the west of Somalia, was suffering through its own civil war between two tribes,
Hutus and Tutsis.
In early April 1994, the Rwandan president's plane was shot down.
The Hutu government blamed Tutsi rebels.
ANNAN:
When the plane was shot down, all hell broke loose, and that became the trigger which set off this mass killing.
NARRATOR:
The killing caught the Clinton administration entirely by surprise.
WESLEY CLARK:
That night, I was leaving the office and I noticed on CNN, on the television screen there was shooting going on.
And I, and I said to my assistant, "What's going on?
What is that?"
He said, "Oh, it's a, it's a, it's 'R-wanda.'
There's some kind of operation going on over there."
I said, "Is that real?
Is that on time?"
He said, "Yes, sir."
(child wailing)
NARRATOR:
Ultimately, some 800,000 Tutsis would be killed.
But with the Black Hawk Down incident still fresh, the Clinton administration did virtually nothing to stop the slaughter.
ANNAN:
We needed international support in Rwanda, but the will to intervene was not there.
They knew what was happening, but they were not about to take the risks.
Rwanda lived in the shadow of Somalia and paid the price for what had happened in Somalia.
NARRATOR:
Clinton's foreign policy was trapped in a kind of no-man's-land.
If Somalia had demonstrated the risks of military intervention,
Rwanda proved the costs of doing nothing.
CLARK:
I know the president felt awful afterwards.
Awful.
As it came out and we understood the scale, the enormity, we realized that there are sins of omission as well as sins of commission.
This was a horrible omission.
Here we go.
All right, flip it, Chelsea.
(applause)
NARRATOR:
Battered by a year Hillary described as "hellish,"
the Clintons were looking forward to their first Christmas in Washington.
Escaping the White House, they visited close friends and even shopped at a local mall.
Bill and Hillary had always been doting parents to Chelsea, trying to keep her life as normal as possible.
SHEEHY:
Both Hillary and Bill, in their own way, were fabulous parents, very protective of Chelsea, and managed to keep a cordon of privacy around her, let her grow up more or less naturally.
NARRATOR:
For the most part, the press respected Chelsea's privacy, but showed no such consideration for her parents.
In mid-December, the first family's hopes for a quiet Christmas were dashed when a call from theWashington Post once again plunged them into the roiling currents of the Whitewater scandal.
GERGEN:
I got a call from Bob Kaiser, who was then the number two editor at theWashington Post.
And he said,
"David, you know, we've known each other a long time,
"and we've made numerous requests to the White House
"for some Whitewater-related documents,
"that we're getting stonewalled, and we're about to go on the attack."
NARRATOR:
Many on his staff counseled the president to turn over his private papers on Whitewater to thePost.
GERGEN:
I said, "Mr. President, this is a flagship newspaper.
"They're going to put a team of investigative reporters on this
"if you don't give these documents over
"and no one, no one knows where that's going to go.
"Why don't we just do it now and just, you know, do the fair and square thing?"
He said, "I agree, let's do it."
He said, "But there's one problem."
He said, "I'm in this with Hillary.
You've got to go convince Hillary."
SHEEHY:
Hillary's attitude toward the press, and thus towards theWashington Post, was to pull back, to reveal nothing, to keep the media or anybody else who's asked questions about their inside life at bay.
So she's locked down.
GERGEN:
Finally, after about two weeks,
I got a call from the counsel's office saying,
"By the way, David, "we have now sent a letter totheWashington Post and we'll read it to you."
And I said, "Fine, let me hear the letter."
And basically it said:
"DearWashington Post, screw you.
No documents."
NARRATOR:
Clinton's refusal to turn over his private Whitewater records was a red flag to many of his political enemies.
In early January, Republican senator Robert Dole demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Whitewater.
If there's nothing to hide, why not lay it all out there?
But every day there's another little drip coming from somewhere.
NARRATOR:
Dole's demand reignited the argument inside the White House.
Most of Clinton's advisors urged him to appoint a special prosecutor, but Hillary and White House counsel Bernie Nussbaum argued against it.
NUSSBAUM:
I said to the president, "They'll investigate you
"and they won't find anything
"because you did nothing in Whitewater.
"But they'll investigate...
if somebody did something
"in Arkansas in the last 20 years,
"they will try to find that person.
"Then they will try to get that person, to save their neck,
"to remember something that you did in Arkansas
"in the last 20 years which was illegal.
"This will last, Mr. President, as long as you're president and beyond."
ICKES:
The contrary argument was,
"We're trying to run a presidency
"and a White House here.
"This is not going to go away.
"Yes, you can stave it off for a while, but at some point, everything is going to come out."
NUSSBAUM:
And that's when Clinton said, "I can't take it anymore.
"Tell me what to do.
"You got to, got to give me...
Tell me what to do," he screams at me.
ICKES:
We finally persuaded Hillary, much against her better instincts, to call the president and say that we wanted him to authorize Attorney General Reno to appoint a special counsel.
NARRATOR:
Exhausted and heartsick over the recent death of his mother,
Clinton did not put up a fight.
On January 20, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno, acting on Clinton's authorization, appointed lawyer Robert Fiske as special counsel in the Whitewater matter.
Most of the newspapers in the country asked me to have a special counsel appointed.
That's what I have done.
I did it so that I could go on with my work.
I want a full investigation.
I want this thing to be done, fully, clearly, and to be over with.
NARRATOR:
Years later, Clinton would say,
"It was the worst mistake of my presidency."
By the spring of 1994,
Bill Clinton had endured 18 months of attacks by his political enemies, the press and even other Democrats.
Tired of playing defense, he set out to reclaim his presidency with one grand gesture.
KLEIN:
Clinton understood that very few presidents create their own greatness.
Greatness is usually thrust upon them by a crisis.
Abe Lincoln had the Civil War,
Franklin Roosevelt had the Depression and World War II.
And so that was a challenge for Clinton.
"What am I going to do that's going to make me remembered?"
For 60 years, this country has tried to reform health care.
President Roosevelt tried, President Truman tried,
President Nixon tried, President Carter tried.
Every time, the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them, but not this time.
(applause)
O'DONNELL:
Health care was to be the giant monument of the Clinton presidency.
Under our plan, every American would receive a health care security card.
O'DONNELL:
Bill Clinton held up this health care card that we were all going to get.
Every one of us were going to get this card from the government, you know, certifying that we had health care coverage, and we were all certain that we were absolutely going to get this done.
NARRATOR:
To lead the signature initiative of his presidency,
Clinton turned, as he always did, to the person he trusted most.
This is a crucial moment in the fight for health care reform in our nation.
We all know our country needs health security that's decent, affordable for every American.
KLEIN:
There are those who would cynically say he owed her for standing by her man, despite Gennifer Flowers and all the rest during the campaign.
But I think it was something else.
Clinton adores her.
And he especially adores her mind.
We cannot provide primary and preventive health care in America if we don't make better use of our nurses.
KLEIN:
Bill Clinton really believed that if anybody was going to come up with the answer to the most vexing public policy problem out there, it was going to be Hillary.
It was one of the stupidest political decisions that Bill Clinton ever made.
And now it's time for everybody to board their buses.
NARRATOR:
Hillary Clinton took to her new job with all the energy and determination pent up during the previous year.
This is an issue that affects everybody.
NARRATOR:
In forums and town meetings across the country, she heard stories of insurance abuse, exorbitant health care bills, and poor quality care.
But once back in Washington, she shut out nearly every outside voice, relying on a tight circle of advisors to write a 1,300-page plan that would radically reshape the nation's health care system.
ICKES:
There was a rigidity and an unwillingness to really listen.
The mark of a good politician is to listen and to be able to understand what's really being said.
The frailty of Hillary was it was too cloistered, too walled off, and she really thought what she perceived as the public opinion in favor of health care would override the resistance in Congress and of the special interests, and it was a big mistake.
This was covered under our old plan.
Oh, yeah, that was a good one, wasn't it?
NARRATOR:
By the summer, Hillary's plan was being pilloried by the health insurance industry as a big government take-over of health care.
O'DONNELL:
We spent more than a year trying to legislate something the country didn't want.
Having choices we don't like is no choice at all.
They choose.
We lose.
O'DONNELL:
We scared people by saying,
"The health care system isn't working, and here comes the government to fix it."
And Ronald Reagan had been schooling this public for many years now that the government is the problem.
People didn't think, "Oh great, here comes the government."
Reagan had won that argument.
NARRATOR:
Clinton did little to hedge Hillary's "all or nothing" bet or avert the looming political catastrophe.
ICKES:
In the president's mind, this was something that he had given to Hillary and he was very, very reluctant to override her.
And I think that because of the husband-wife relationship that it was not something that he was willing to take on.
HARRIS:
It inhibited Bill Clinton from following his own independent judgment, his own best instincts of when to compromise.
He found it difficult to defy her very powerful wishes, and that's not a position a president wants to be in.
CROWD (chanting):
Socialized medicine makes me sick!
Socialized medicine makes me sick!
NARRATOR:
Throughout the summer of 1994, as lawmakers heard from their frightened constituents,
Hillary's health care bill lost support.
By Labor Day, before it even came up for a vote in Congress, the Clinton health care bill was dead.
REICH:
The defeat of health care was a huge defeat.
It was the number-one objective, and to have it defeated was a repudiation, in a sense, or at least felt like a repudiation of the Clinton administration.
NARRATOR:
By the fall of 1994, the Clinton presidency was at its lowest ebb.
Weakened by scandal and the defeat of health care,
Clinton was about to be challenged by a new and formidable rival.
NEWT GINGRICH:
I am a genuine revolutionary.
They are the genuine reactionaries.
We are going to change their world.
They will do anything to stop us.
NARRATOR:
Brimming with self-confidence,
Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich had spent more than a decade planning his assault on the Democratic Party.
TRENT LOTT:
He was a giant personality.
He was one of the best policy wonks and thinkers of new ideas around, but his style was very different from mine.
His personality and approach was... if it's not arrogance, it's at least overconfidence.
You know, Clausewitz said that war is politics by other means.
Newt thought the reverse was true, that politics was war by other means.
NARRATOR:
Gingrich's ultimate goal was nothing less than a dismantling of what he called the "liberal welfare state."
He would begin by trying to break the Democrats' 40-year stranglehold on the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections.
LOTT:
We had some people that were not satisfied to just passively go along with being in an abused, mistreated minority.
And there were a lot of Republicans that had been in the minority for so long they thought,
"This is where we belong and this is okay, if they'll just give us a crumb or two."
Newt started rockin' the boat.
NARRATOR:
Gingrich decided that the best way to achieve a Republican victory in the midterms was to run against Clinton.
Republican candidates across the country morphed their Democratic opponents into the president.
ANNOUNCER:
Look at Congressman Tim Johnson's voting record.
It looks just like Bill Clinton's liberal agenda.
TONY BLANKLEY:
The plan was to nationalize the election.
Newt saw fundamental flaws in the Democratic Party's relationship with the American electorate.
And he wanted to develop and exploit those and run a campaign based on that.
NARRATOR:
As the elections approached, Clinton hit the campaign trail, hoping that his old magic could hold back the Republican tide.
BRANTLEY:
Part of Bill Clinton's persona is an abiding belief that if he can just have enough time, he can win over just about anybody.
NARRATOR:
Clinton was sure his record could yet win over the American people.
By the fall of 1994, the economy was growing again.
In September, he added a new ban on assault weapons to his list of accomplishments.
But scandals, the failure of health care, and foreign policy missteps weighed heavily on public opinion.
ICKES:
I remember him saying to me on God knows how many speeches,
"Harold, if I can just communicate to enough Americans
"what we have done and where we want to take the country, we'll win this."
I now declare the polls open.
PETER JENNINGS:
One of the big questions of the day is whether the Republicans have been successful in turning this election into a referendum on Bill Clinton as they had wanted.
Our exit polls are turning up bad news all over the country for President Clinton and his party.
BLANKLEY:
I had called a friend at NBC to find out what the 1:30 exit polls looked like and she told me,
"Well, Tony, I actually haven't seen the exit...
"the 1:30 exit polls, they're holding them back.
"Apparently you guys are doing so well that there must be something wrong with the polling,"
and that was the beginning of a hopeful evening that turned into a glorious one.
This is truly a wildly historic night.
I mean, this is just... (applause and cheers)
DAN RATHER:
The Republican Revolution of election '94 shook Capitol Hill like an earthquake today.
Its reverberations went into statehouses and moved the whole political landscape sharply to the right.
NARRATOR:
By the end of the night,
Republicans had picked up 54 seats in the House and eight in the Senate, winning control of both chambers of Congress.
ICKES:
The longest walk I took in my life was from my...
I was still in the basement in the West Wing, over to the second floor of the residence to tell him what he already knew, that we had lost the House and the Senate.
NARRATOR:
That Christmas was another dismal one.
Clinton wandered the corridors of the White House obsessing about his defeat.
The old question haunted him:
"What did I do wrong?"
PANETTA:
In politics, you want to be loved.
Politics is about wanting to be loved, and suddenly there's a message that maybe they don't love you.
And how do you deal with that?
He really went through a lot of, you know, of kind of internal conflicts.
But again, typical Bill Clinton, you know, he was angry, he was mad, he was, you know, kind of, "What went wrong?"
But at the same time, he was asking himself,
"How do I fix it?"
REICH:
There was no doubt in my mind that Bill Clinton could come back or would come back.
He always came back.
Bill Clinton was constitutionally incapable of not coming back.
The real question was how.
In what form?
BILL CLINTON:
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, my fellow Americans.
Again, we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once again, our democracy has spoken.
NARRATOR:
On January 24, 1995, President Bill Clinton addressed Congress and the American people.
Two years into his presidency, and just months after suffering the worst midterm election defeat in modern history, he was chastened and humble.
And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, "We hear you.
We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us."
(applause)
MARK PENN:
After the midterms, the president, I think, felt that he was almost a hostage in his own White House.
He was unhappy with the White House staff, he was unhappy with the policy direction, and so he actually began a very quiet operation to begin to change his administration.
NARRATOR:
Beginning in early 1995,
White House staffers began to notice a change in the president.
His speeches contained unfamiliar language and cadences.
In meetings, he'd get up abruptly and leave the room.
Many aides felt he was no longer listening to them.
ROBERT REICH:
I recall a meeting that the president's economic advisors and political advisors were having about how he was going to spend the next three weeks, what themes he was going to emphasize.
And I remember somebody from the back of the room,
I think it was Erskine Bowles, then the president's chief of staff, saying, "This is all irrelevant."
Irrelevant?
We're the staff.
We are the people who help the president.
Why are we irrelevant?
And he didn't exactly say.
He said there was some other force in the White House.
And again and again there seemed to be instances-- it was almost like in astronomy, there's a black hole and you can only tell it's there because planets begin moving into its gravitational orbit.
But you look and there's nothing there.
That was Dick Morris.
Dick Morris was the black hole.
Dick Morris, an abrasive political consultant from New York, had a history with the Clintons that went all the way back to Arkansas.
JOHN HARRIS:
Other than Hillary Clinton, he was the most important political advisor that Bill Clinton had had over the course of his career.
He was there for the very first election to governor in 1978 and had been with Bill Clinton for most of the Arkansas gubernatorial years.
NARRATOR:
Morris set up shop in the White House and began to chair weekly strategy meetings that were attended by most of the president's senior staff.
HAROLD ICKES:
Clinton typically dominates any group or discussion that he's in.
In the meetings on the second floor of the residence, which we had every week,
Clinton would literally sit there for an hour sometimes, hardly saying a word, listening to Morris.
MORRIS:
When I first started to work for Clinton in the White House, he had two big negatives:
a third of the country thought he was immoral and a third of the country thought he was weak, and I basically went to him and I said,
"I can't do much about the immoral, but we sure can solve the weak."
And therefore we embarked on a conscious strategy of making sure people saw Clinton as strong.
NARRATOR:
The heart of Morris's operation was his polling, which he used to diagnose where Clinton's weaknesses lay and how he could correct them.
HARRIS:
Polling became absolutely central.
How do we present ourselves as an alternative to Newt Gingrich?
How are people seeing the president?
What sort of policies would make them feel better about Bill Clinton?
JOE KLEIN:
They polled everything.
They polled every last word that came out of his mouth.
They polled where he should go on vacation.
Instead of going to Martha's Vineyard, that elite island off the coast of Massachusetts, they had him riding a horse in Wyoming.
I think Bill Clinton's allergic to horses.
But that's what the focus group said would be a more acceptable vacation.
MORRIS:
One of the big problems was the relationship between Bill and Hillary.
Voters thought that it was a zero-sum game, that for Hillary to be strong, Bill would have to be weak.
And, as a result, the perception of Hillary's strength became a perception of Bill's weakness.
The polling made me understand that, and when I came back to work for Clinton, one of the first things I did was to tell Hillary,
"You can be as influential as you want to be,
"but do it in private.
"Don't sit in on the strategy meetings,
"don't make the appointments,
"don't make everybody be cleared with you.
"At the bedroom at night, tell him what to do, but don't let it be seen in public."
NARRATOR:
Morris's advice hit home.
After the stunning defeat in the midterm elections,
Hillary had received a large share of the blame.
ICKES:
She was outspoken, she was smart, she was hard-driving, and some people resented her.
Remember, during the campaign, there was two for the price of one.
Well, people aren't electing two for the price of one.
They're electing the president.
GAIL SHEEHY:
She had been caught out trying to be a co-president.
That just wasn't gonna fly, and that's when she had to begin to really reexamine, again as she did as governor's wife,
"What does the public want from me in this role?"
And to take on gradually a little bit more of the traditional role of first lady.
Well, welcome to the White House and to the beginning of the Christmas season here.
NARRATOR:
Unsatisfied by her ceremonial role as first lady,
Hillary began working on issues important to her, but not alarming to the public.
She began writing a book about children and traveled abroad with Chelsea to advocate for women's rights.
She wrote a weekly syndicated column, and even consulted a psychic in the White House.
But it wasn't enough.
SHEEHY:
She felt, for one of the rare times in her life, completely depressed.
She said everything that she was doing wasn't working.
She just didn't know what to do anymore, because she really wanted to be in there right at Bill Clinton's side, fighting all the political battles that he was doing.
The president wants to defend Washington bureaucracy,
Washington red tape and Washington spending, and higher taxes to pay for less out of Washington.
NARRATOR:
While the Clintons struggled to find their way back from the political wilderness, their rival, Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, was dominating politics in Washington.
TRENT LOTT:
I think Newt felt like he had led a great revolution and led the House-- and the Senate that for matter-- to victory, and that he could...
we could be the, you know, the driving force in this city, and that he was, in effect, comparable or equal to the president.
NARRATOR:
Gingrich and his newly elected army of Republican representatives quickly passed bill after bill from their "Contract with America."
Sensing his strength, Gingrich was intent on drawing Clinton into a political showdown that would determine, once and for all, who was in charge.
In the spring of 1995, Gingrich picked his battleground.
I think the central issue that we challenged the Clinton administration on was on the budget.
We wanted to balance the budget.
We thought that was the most important domestic policy issue that existed in the country, and it was gonna be ugly, as all deficit fights inevitably are.
What you currently have is a system designed to be a centralized bureaucracy.
NARRATOR:
In May, Gingrich unveiled a plan to eliminate the federal budget deficit in seven years through huge cuts in government spending.
Most of the cuts would be concentrated in two government health insurance programs:
Medicare and Medicaid.
Gingrich had managed to shift the focus of power and media attention from Clinton to himself.
CHRIS JENNINGS:
Washington and the media is all about the new flavor of the month.
And the new flavor of the month was not the Clinton administration.
You had Newt Gingrich...
I mean, he was a powerful, charismatic figure who had an answer to every question.
There are three themes that define where we are right now.
JENNINGS:
And he not only wasn't afraid to talk, he longed to talk.
His problem was, over time, he talked too much.
NARRATOR:
With Gingrich in the spotlight,
Clinton seemed increasingly peripheral.
April 18, 1995.
Bill Clinton gives a press conference, and we're all over him about his lack of power.
Newt's running the town!
Newt's in control!
Yes, Jean.
REPORTER:
President Clinton,
Republicans have dominated political debate in this country since they took over Congress in January, and even tonight, two of the major television networks declined to broadcast this event live.
Do you worry about making sure your voice is heard in the coming months?
Clinton is forced to say that the president is still relevant here.
The Constitution gives me relevance, the power of our ideas gives me relevance, the record we have built up over the last two years and the things we are trying to do to implement it give it relevance.
The president is relevant here.
DEE DEE MYERS:
It was awful.
You know, "The president is still relevant."
Just the fact that he felt compelled to say those words says everything.
I am willing to work with the Republicans.
The question is, what happens now?
NEWSCASTER:
About a third of the building has been blown away.
SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL:
The next day, on April 19, the bomb went off at Oklahoma City.
(baby crying)
It was the largest domestic terrorist event in American history.
That changed everything.
The bombing in Oklahoma City was an attack on innocent children and defenseless citizens.
It was an act of cowardice and it was evil.
The United States will not tolerate it, and I will not allow the people of this country to be intimidated by evil cowards.
NARRATOR:
Within 48 hours of the incident, the FBI arrested 26-year-old Timothy McVeigh, a former soldier with a burning hatred for the government.
His massive truck bomb, detonated outside the Murrah Federal Building, killed 149 workers, along with 19 children.
Four days after the bombing,
Clinton traveled to Oklahoma City to console the mourners.
DON BAER:
I went with him down to Oklahoma City for that Sunday morning.
On the flight, we worked on the speech some more.
He was very focused on what to say.
I remember we went into what I think they call the Cow Palace, and I've never been in a setting that was as eerily silent as that one was except for the sound of sobbing.
ROBERT McNEELY:
He stood there for hours and met with every single person and talked to everybody.
It's kind of a throwaway line now, "I feel your pain,"
but he literally could.
I mean he could take people and just hug them and connect to them in a way and really listen to them.
CLINTON:
You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything.
And you have certainly not lost America, for we will stand with you.
PETER BAKER:
He really found a way to embrace the country to help them channel their grief, their confusion.
It gets him out of the mode of reacting to Congress and into the mode of being a national leader, the person that the country can look to for assurance and reliance and strength.
To all my fellow Americans beyond this hall, I say, one thing we owe those who have sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil.
WALDMAN:
He spoke to the country as a unifying, a healing figure.
But, very subtly and appropriately, he also drew attention to the fact that the rhetoric Timothy McVeigh was using was not all that different from the rhetoric that the talk show hosts and the militias and even some of the members of Congress were using.
Let us teach our children that the God of comfort is also the God of righteousness.
Those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind.
BAER:
Here was a president who had been, by many people, deemed not to be strong, who suddenly was being viewed as both sensitive and strong, which was a great and very powerful combination.
At that moment, perhaps for the first moment, he inhabited the presidency.
NARRATOR:
Bill Clinton had begun to find his voice at home, but he commanded little respect on the international stage.
For two years, Clinton had stumbled through a series of foreign policy mishaps.
An ill-considered action in Somalia had cost the lives of 18 U.S. soldiers and deterred the president from asserting American military power around the world.
Without strong U.S. leadership, the world's problems were reaching a critical state.
In Central Europe,
Bosnian Serbs had begun wiping out the largely Muslim population in their own country.
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:
In 1995, the massacres in Bosnia were in full swing.
Daily rivers of blood.
Really, it was appalling.
After two years of this kind of savagery,
Bill Clinton had a disaster on his hands.
This was genocide in Europe.
NARRATOR:
Since becoming president,
Clinton had deferred to European countries with soldiers in Bosnia as part of the United Nations peacekeeping operation.
(explosion)
KOFI ANNAN:
One has to understand that when you are in a peacekeeping operation, which is an international effort, one president cannot call the shots.
One president cannot take the decision.
Particularly when the president's country has no troops on the ground.
NARRATOR:
Clinton's reluctance to send American soldiers to Bosnia collided with growing calls for U.S. intervention.
Mr. President, I cannot not tell you something.
I have been in the former Yugoslavia.
We must do something to stop the bloodshed in that country.
MORRIS:
The ongoing scenes of this horrific genocidal slaughter going on by the Serbs against the Muslims was just undermining Clinton's image day after day.
Clinton would complain,
"The media's trying to force me into a war and I don't want it.
I'm not going to go into my own Vietnam."
And every night, these images came on the screen.
NARRATOR:
The violence in Bosnia reached a climax in the summer of 1995.
A new set of European leaders implored Clinton to act.
"The position of leader of the free world,"
complained French president Jacques Chirac, "is vacant."
Privately, Clinton had begun to rethink his policy.
Haunted by his failure to stop a genocide in Rwanda the previous year, he could no longer stand idly by.
MORRIS:
Finally the president set up a trip wire where if the Bosnian Serbs attacked, it would trigger a massive NATO military response.
NARRATOR:
On July 11, 1995,
Bosnian Serb soldiers overran the city of Srebrenica and murdered more than 8,000 defenseless men and boys.
ANNAN:
That was a real shock for everyone.
And for that to happen in Europe, many decades after World War II, was something that nobody could sit back and swallow.
NARRATOR:
For Clinton, the wire had been tripped.
On August 30, fighter planes from NATO bases across Europe, acting on the president's go-ahead, launched a massive attack against Serbs in Bosnia called
"Operation Deliberate Force."
RICHARD CLARKE:
He didn't blink.
And there wasn't tension on him, there wasn't pressure on him, he wasn't sweating and worrying about,
"Did I do the right thing?"
We knew then, we knew that day, that we had a commander-in-chief who was rational and comfortable with the use of force.
NARRATOR:
For the next two weeks, NATO pilots flew 3,500 sorties, as millions around the world watched the air war unfold on television.
REPORTER:
The NATO action began early this morning, the harsh light of fires and explosions coloring the night sky.
Some people watched the bombardment from their houses, but after more than 10,000 deaths here in the last three years,
most Sarajevans had given up any hope of outside intervention.
Last night it came on a scale which could yet change the course of this war.
NARRATOR:
On September 14, Serbian guns ringing Sarajevo fell silent.
Two months later,
Clinton convened the warring parties in Dayton, Ohio, to negotiate an end to hostilities.
The parties have agreed to put down their arms and roll up their sleeves and work for peace.
AMANPOUR:
Finally, when you got tough and you said, "Enough already,
"we don't accept genocide at the end of the 20th century in our backyard," they got serious and it stopped.
And then the United States-- not the Europeans-- led the Dayton peace process.
And to this day, imperfect as it may be, it has held.
NARRATOR:
The Dayton Peace Accords were a triumph for Clinton's foreign policy and restored his standing as leader of the free world.
The same month, he visited the troubled country of Northern Ireland, where crowds hailed him as a peacemaker.
The young people-- Catholic and Protestant alike-- made it clear to me not only with their words, but by the expressions on their faces that they want peace.
NARRATOR:
After three years as president, he had developed a new vision of America's interests abroad.
It would come to be known as the "Clinton Doctrine."
CLINTON:
It's easy to say that we really have no interests in who lives in this or that valley in Bosnia, or who owns a strip of brush land in the Horn of Africa, or some piece of parched earth by the Jordan River.
But the true measure of our interests lies not in how small or distant these places are, or in whether we have trouble pronouncing their names.
The question we must ask is, what are the consequences to our security of letting conflicts fester and spread?
We cannot, indeed, we should not, do everything or be everywhere.
But where our values and our interests are at stake, and where we can make a difference, we must be prepared to do so.
WESLEY CLARK:
There was a Clinton Doctrine, but it wasn't purely a military doctrine.
It was a national security doctrine.
President Clinton thought the United States is an indispensible nation.
You can't do things without the United States.
It may not be only the United States, and it's certainly not doing it alone, but it's the United States that brings the decisive edge in being able to get things done.
And that where you can make a difference, you should.
In the latest poll I saw, 86% of the American people said, "Balance the budget now.
Don't wait, don't postpone, don't give us promises."
NARRATOR:
Even as Clinton brought peace to Europe, the ideological war at home was heating up.
Speaker Newt Gingrich was standing by his balanced budget proposal, daring the president to veto it.
Once again, Clinton hoped to use his powers of persuasion to end the impasse.
PANETTA:
He was thinking,
"What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna capture these guys.
"Because A, I'm smarter than they are,
"and B, that's my whole life's learning,
"is how to capture people.
"And I'm gonna do it through sheer force of personality.
"I can sit down with Newt Gingrich,
I can sit down with the devil himself, and I can cut a deal."
NARRATOR:
Gingrich would not yield to Clinton's charms.
Unless the president agreed to huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid,
Congress would refuse to appropriate money for the federal government, shutting it down.
TONY BLANKLEY:
The one thing that the House of Representatives has is the power of the purse.
They can deny money.
It is the only thing that the House of Representatives alone can do, can refuse to vote an appropriation.
So, inevitably, whatever the fight was going to be, it was going to come down to us denying the White House money.
NARRATOR:
Clinton seemed caught between two toxic political choices.
If he opposed Gingrich's balanced budget plan, he would be portrayed as a defender of big government deficits;
if he gave in, he would effectively cede control of the government to Gingrich and the Republicans.
But there was a third option.
Dick Morris had been polling the Republicans' proposed budget cuts and believed he had found an opening.
MORRIS:
I did a poll for Clinton where I tested each of those cuts and its impact.
And I said to him,
"Do you want the four-hour briefing or the one-word briefing?"
And he said start with the one word.
I said "Medicare."
I said, "None of the other cuts are nearly as important as the cut they're proposing in Medicare."
NARRATOR:
The public supported a balanced budget, Morris argued, but not at the expense of their most cherished federal program.
MORRIS:
I said that what's important is that you take away from the Republicans the balanced budget issue.
If you can show how you can balance the budget without cutting Medicare but by cutting everything else, then you can call their bluff.
And then all of a sudden it becomes a question of,
"What do we cut?" not "Do we cut?"
NARRATOR:
Morris called his strategy "triangulation."
Clinton seized on it as a way to regain the initiative from the Republicans.
In June, over the strong objections of liberals on his staff, he announced his own balanced budget plan, protecting Medicare and Medicaid.
There is an alternative, a way to balance this budget.
It's not that we shouldn't balance the budget.
We should balance the budget.
I strongly support it;
we ought to do that.
I believe we're going to do that.
But we don't have to do it in a draconian way that hurts the American people.
You know, whether or not to balance the budget, we can't win that fight.
We're going to lose.
Once you accept that we're going to balance the budget, now let's have a fight about what we're going to cut and what we're going to protect.
That's a fight we can win.
Are you going to protect Medicare?
Are you going to protect Social Security?
You want to shut down the government over that?
Let's go.
NARRATOR:
In mid-November, with the issue of Medicare cuts still dividing the two sides, the federal government ran out of money and shut down.
Nearly a million federal employees were instantly furloughed;
government offices closed;
all but the most essential services ground to a halt.
VOICEMAIL MESSAGE:
The Washington Passport Agency is closed for lack of funding.
Due to the shutdown of the federal government...
Social Security...
Library of Congress... the National Park Service...
is closed indefinitely.
If it ends soon, the shutdown will have been a temporary inconvenience.
But if prolonged, it could cost the country a lot of anguish and many millions of dollars.
PETER BAKER:
Clinton took a gamble, the biggest gamble of his presidency to that point, in saying, "No, I'm going to let the government shut down rather than accept the cuts that you're proposing here."
REPORTER:
Day three and nobody moves, least of all the 800,000 federal workers forced to stay home.
The American people should not be held hostage anymore to the Republican budget priorities.
PROTESTERS:
Work, work, put the government back to work.
NARRATOR:
Through a first shutdown in November and then a longer one in December, neither Clinton nor Gingrich blinked.
It was high-stakes poker.
Whichever side was blamed for the shutdown would probably lose the next presidential election.
BLANKLEY:
Our conviction was, ultimately, a president is held responsible for his government.
And that if we didn't blink, at some point the public would say,
"The president needs to get this government functioning."
NARRATOR:
The pressure on the president was enormous.
Every day, the political damage mounted.
Almost a billion dollars in lost wages, new Medicare and Social Security claims going unprocessed;
the federal government unable to discharge even its most basic functions.
And the confrontation played out on television every night.
Day 13 of the federal budget crisis and the shutdown that's brought parts of the government to a dead stop.
The major players were all assembled in Washington today, and they were talking, but not to each other.
Now, one of the major problems we have in America is we have a president who doesn't mind playing, he doesn't mind talking, but he seems to hate working.
We're working.
This was all sui generis, this was completely new.
Nobody knew the temperament of the country, how it was going to play out.
And it was literally hour by hour, certainly day by day.
JENNINGS:
There was a fear by many Democrats, even some within the White House, who just thought,
"You know, he's not going to be able to say 'no' to them.
"He wants to get along with them.
He thinks that's the way to save his presidency."
NARRATOR:
With the government closed,
Clinton prowled the empty halls of the White House, deprived of the human contact he craved.
Among the few people permitted to come to work were the White House interns, including a 22-year-old named Monica Lewinsky.
The daughter of a Beverly Hills doctor and his socialite wife,
Lewinsky was a graduate of Oregon's Lewis Clark College.
She had an air of confidence, even boldness, that set her apart from her fellow interns.
On November 15, the second day of the shutdown,
Clinton and Lewinsky struck up a conversation in which Lewinsky confessed, "I have a huge crush on you."
There were almost these sparks flying between them from that first moment when they saw each other, and as Monica said, "He gave me the full Bill Clinton and undressed me with his eyes."
NARRATOR:
Hours later, the two had their first sexual encounter.
WILLIAM CHAFE:
It's almost as though there was a part of Bill Clinton that he had no control over.
That whenever it had the opportunity to come out, it was gonna come out.
And with no forethought, with no calculation, with no sense of the consequences, it was simply gonna happen.
And that's terrifying.
REPORTER:
At this hour, U.S. president Bill Clinton is meeting with top Congressional leaders in another attempt to resolve their budget standoff.
NARRATOR:
As Clinton recklessly pursued his affair with Lewinsky, he and Gingrich were locked in their own high-wire embrace.
The president offered compromise after compromise, but Gingrich would not budge.
Unless Clinton agreed to his formula of budget and tax cuts, he would keep the government closed.
BLUMENTHAL:
They believed that he was soft, that he could be pushed around, and that they could have their way.
They believed that he lacked the confidence to stand up to them.
They believed they understood his psychology, and they thought that they had the political upper hand.
NARRATOR:
But Clinton sensed that his political enemies had overreached and were out of step with the American people.
PENN:
It was our theory we were gonna win if it got to this point.
The polling showed it, we felt confident about it.
We thought we had a winning hand.
People don't really hate the government;
they just don't want the government spending too much money.
They want the government doing the right things.
And they don't want the government shut down.
As long as they insist on plunging ahead with a budget that violates our values, in a process that is characterized more by pressure than constitutional practice, I will fight it.
I am fighting it today, I will fight it tomorrow.
I will fight it next week and next month.
(applause)
I will fight it until we get a budget that is fair to all Americans.
(cheering and applause)
PANETTA:
There is a moment I will never forget in the Oval Office.
We had been going through negotiations on the budget.
And there were some of us that were nervous that President Clinton might go too far, that he might want to go so far in compromising that he might hurt himself politically.
And so we kept putting different offers on the table, and they kept coming back and saying,
"Not good enough, not good enough."
And we finally reached a day where he wanted to do one more compromise, one more step.
Newt Gingrich said, "No."
And Bill Clinton basically looked at them and said,
"You know, Newt, I can't do what you want me to do.
"I don't believe it's right for the country.
And it may cost me the election, but I can't do it."
And my first reaction was he's drawn a line that he had to draw.
He understood that he would have to take a risk of not winning, and winning was what he was always about.
From that moment, I think, in many ways, it became a renewal of Bill Clinton in terms of who he was, both within himself and with the American people.
CROWD:
We want to work!
We want to work!
As of last night, the public appeared to be more sympathetic to Mr. Clinton's position.
46% blamed the Republicans, 27% Mr. Clinton.
PETER KING:
Many traditional Americans, including some Republicans, were outraged that a Speaker of the House would shut down the government.
You know, Newt Gingrich is not the president.
He shouldn't be acting like he's the president.
Suddenly, Bill Clinton became the embodiment of traditional America.
He's the president of the United States.
Whether you agree with him or not, no one has the right to shut down the government when he's the president.
NARRATOR:
Finally, Senator Bob Dole, worried that the shutdown would hurt his presidential campaign, corralled the necessary votes in the Senate to reopen the government.
Clinton had won.
(applause)
In the weeks that followed,
Clinton staked out a middle ground between the two parties with a vision of government that was neither enemy nor savior.
The era of big government is over.
(applause)
But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.
(applause)
WALDMAN:
It was a real change in his vision of how the presidency could work.
He had started with this heroic notion of the presidency-- passing big laws, doing grand things-- and then the public just rejected it.
It hit a brick wall of what the public thought of government.
And he realized that he had to change how he was president, and he had to rebuild that public trust in government.
NARRATOR:
Capitalizing on his momentum,
Clinton announced a stream of initiatives designed to show middle-class Americans that he understood, and could improve, their lives.
MORRIS:
After the government shutdown, we adopted a political strategy based on one word-- values.
And our concept was that we would help you raise your child better.
We have worked very hard to help communities fight crime.
MORRIS:
"I'll provide you with drug-free school zones, school uniforms, medical leave for your children."
Reduce teen smoking by raising the price of cigarettes, putting into place tough restrictions on advertising...
MORRIS:
I'll give you all of these weapons to raise better children.
This is a V-chip, and it will be required to be put in all new television sets.
NARRATOR:
Not even the Republicans could stand in Clinton's way.
LOTT:
After trying to move heaven and earth, big swaths in his first two years, he started feeding us up small pieces of bills.
And he'd get into our knickers with ideas that we really could not vote against:
a hundred thousand cops on the street.
A Republican gonna vote against more law enforcement officers?
NARRATOR:
It was a politics of the possible, not the things he dreamed of doing, but the things he could do.
MORRIS:
He crafted a whole new view in American politics, literally a third way, a moderate way, and achieved the results the American people wanted.
NARRATOR:
Three years into his first term,
Clinton had pulled one of the greatest Houdini acts in presidential history.
With approval ratings on the rise, he could once again call himself the Comeback Kid.
But as with nearly every Bill Clinton comeback, it was soon followed by yet another scandal.
Yesterday, a trove of documents from Mrs. Clinton's old law firm that various investigators issued subpoenas for months ago were suddenly discovered in the office of one of the Clintons' aides.
NARRATOR:
In January 1996, a sheaf of Hillary's old billing records was discovered in the private residence of the White House.
The documents showed that she had done legal work for her old friend Jim McDougal while he was engaged in fraudulent real estate deals in Arkansas.
The Whitewater inquiry, which had receded from the front pages, suddenly came roaring back.
REPORTER:
There's the issue of why it took the White House so long to turn up the billing records.
This is a pattern:
delay, deception, withhold.
GORMLEY:
The discovery of the billing records for Hillary Clinton's work for Jim McDougal and Madison Guaranty was explosive.
Everyone had been looking for those billing records.
There were subpoenas all over the place to turn those over.
And then all of a sudden, they just show up.
Our job is to get at the truth and the truth will speak for itself, so thank you very much.
NARRATOR:
The Whitewater inquiry was now in the hands of a new independent counsel.
Kenneth Starr had been appointed by a panel of conservative judges to replace Robert Fiske.
Starr was a respected jurist and former official in the Bush Administration.
At first, his appointment caused little consternation in the White House.
ICKES:
The jury was out initially because Starr had quite a sterling reputation.
He was well known in judicial circles.
He was not rabid.
He was considered a very good conservative, a very good court of appeals justice, so people were hopeful.
NARRATOR:
In fact, however, Starr would prove to be a far more aggressive independent counsel than his predecessor.
Unlike Fiske, who determined to finish his work quickly,
Starr would follow his investigation wherever it led, no matter the cost in time or money.
BRANTLEY:
I came to believe it was a persecution, not a prosecution.
It was an investigation in search of a crime, which is not how investigations are supposed to work.
They were not investigating an allegation of a crime.
They were looking for a crime.
NARRATOR:
To Starr, the sudden appearance of Hillary's billing records seemed anything but accidental.
KEN STARR:
The discovery of the Rose Law Firm records was a very significant event.
It was a significant event because there had been a subpoena outstanding for those law firm records for a long, long time.
And the Rose Law Firm said,
"We don't have them, and they were taken away."
And there were issues as to, well, why would law firm records leave the law firm?
They weren't individual records, they were law firm records.
So, why wouldn't they be there?
Where are they?
REPORTER:
Mrs. Clinton!
Good morning, how are you all?
REPORTER:
Mrs. Clinton, how important is this week in terms of turning your image around?
Oh, I think it's important to talk about the book I've written about America's children, and that's what I'm going to try to do, plus answer all the questions.
NARRATOR:
The discovery of her missing billing records undermined Hillary's efforts to recede from the public spotlight.
MAN:
The Rose Law Firm records were found in the living quarters of the White House in August.
NARRATOR:
As she set out on a national tour to promote her book on children, she could not escape questions about Whitewater.
MAN:
It's an important question, Mrs. Clinton, because Republicans on the Senate banking committee...
SHEEHY:
She was totally under siege.
So was the president, but he allows this kind of thing much more easily to roll off his back.
Hillary becomes obsessed.
She has an enemy, the enemy is the special prosecutor, and one or the other is going to be killed.
NARRATOR:
In Ken Starr, though, Hillary had met her match.
Behind his avuncular smile, he was relentless and implacable.
On January 19, Starr subpoenaed Hillary, the only first lady ever to have been forced to testify before a grand jury.
Rather than take her testimony in the White House, he insisted that she come to the federal courthouse in downtown Washington.
I think the idea that they would make her come to the courthouse and to the grand jury was intended to humiliate her.
REPORTER:
Would you rather have been somewhere else today?
Oh, about a million other places today, indeed.
NARRATOR:
In the end, Hillary's billing records proved little.
They showed that she had represented Jim McDougal, but didn't prove she'd known he had used fraudulent loans to prop up the failing Whitewater development.
Though many urged him to drop the investigation,
Starr redoubled his efforts.
PODESTA:
He re-opened all the files that Fiske had closed;
he chased down and challenged every privilege that had been afforded not just to President Clinton but to previous presidents.
He decided to re-interview everybody, bring 'em all back to the grand jury.
NARRATOR:
The independent counsel focused on finding witnesses in Arkansas who could testify to the Clintons' participation in fraudulent real estate deals 15 years before.
BRANTLEY:
People at the lowest level were hurt.
People's lives were ruined.
People were left in debt that theyook years to get out of.
They broke people.
I mean, investigators invaded high school campuses to put the thumb screws on high school kids for information.
NARRATOR:
In May, Starr was able to convict Jim McDougal of loan fraud.
Under the threat of imprisonment,
McDougal agreed to cooperate.
Suddenly, he claimed that Bill Clinton had known about his illegal loans.
GORMLEY:
After Jim McDougal is convicted, everything changes.
Up until that point, he never pointed the finger at the Clintons.
He never indicated that they were involved in wrongdoing.
But once he's convicted, all of a sudden he begins coming up with stories that implicate the Clintons.
NARRATOR:
McDougal's testimony was confused and contradictory;
few believed him.
Unable to find other credible evidence,
Starr felt stymied and increasingly determined to find something that would stick to the president.
GORMLEY:
There's no question at all that at this point, the Starr prosecutors believe that the Clintons are hiding evidence and lying when they deny that they had involvement in some of McDougal's enterprises.
And conversely, the White House thinks that these Starr prosecutors have shifted and now all they're doing is a president hunt.
NARRATOR:
As Starr scoured the president's past for evidence of crimes,
Clinton's prospects for the future were looking brighter than ever.
BAKER:
By the time that he is heading into summer, looking toward the fall for his reelection,
President Clinton is a new man again.
He's no longer the figure of ridicule, the weak figure he had become in 1994.
He's standing strong again with the public.
And his oppones are looking weak.
NARRATOR:
Clinton's Republican opponent in the presidential election that fall was Kansas senator Robert Dole.
With the economy strong and Clinton resurgent,
Dole could do little but characterize the president as a free-spending liberal.
The federal government is too big and it spends too much of your money-- your money.
NARRATOR:
To force the issue, the Republican Congress in August sent Clinton a welfare reform bill he had already vetoed twice.
Welfare reform had been a key part of Clinton's "New Democrat" philosophy, but he was aware of how much liberals in his own party hated the bill.
HARRIS:
Bill Clinton authentically believed in welfare reform.
That's welfare reform in the abstract.
He wasn't being asked to sign welfare reform in the abstract.
And so the question was, do you sign it and proclaim a victory knowing that to do so is to leave many in your own party's base hugely demoralized?
Or do you veto it and accept the consequences of vetoing popular legislation just a few months before the election?
It was an agonizing choice for Bill Clinton.
NARRATOR:
In August, the president signed the welfare reform bill.
When I ran for president four years ago,
I pledged to end welfare as we know it.
I have worked very hard for four years to do just that.
Today, the Congress will vote on legislation that gives us a chance to live up to that promise.
NARRATOR:
Clinton's decision was the last straw for many on the left.
Several of his closest political allies resigned in protest.
LAWRENCE O'DONNELL:
It made him someone who was capable of anything.
And it no longer mattered what party he was in.
You couldn't tell what he would do and what he would be willing to go along with.
NARRATOR:
With welfare reform behind him,
Clinton solidified his grip on the race.
Deprived of his last best campaign issue,
Bob Dole waged an anemic race.
Clinton, meanwhile, campaigned with gusto.
We will together build a bridge to the 21st century wide enough and strong enough to take us to America's best days.
Will you do that?
(cheers and applause)
ICKES:
He was in his element.
He was shorn of this great burden that had been over him in '94.
He was out making the case in the best, most positive and toughest way he could, and he was loving it.
KING:
Clinton was no longer the issue.
People weren't asking how he became president, or, "This guy's illegitimate."
He was now looked upon as the president.
NARRATOR:
In November, Clinton won by a margin that had once seemed inconceivable, taking 31 states and 70% of the electoral votes.
I, William Jefferson Clinton, do solemnly swear...
That I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States.
That I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States.
BAKER:
The reelection in 1996 is obviously one of the great comebacks in American politics.
A president who had been written off as roadkill just two years earlier managed to come back to a very convincing reelection in 1996, the first Democrat to win a second term since Franklin Roosevelt.
NARRATOR:
Clinton had survived, some believed by selling his soul;
others, by finding it again.
As he gave his second inaugural address,
Bill Clinton sought to turn the page on the ugly partisan battles of the last four years.
The American people returned to office a president of one party and a Congress of another.
Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore.
BAER:
The one part of that speech that I think mattered more to him than any other was his reference to the scriptural phrase to be the repairer of the breach, from Isaiah.
They call all us instead to be repairers of the breach.
BAER:
He really felt like he had come through this trial by fire and storm and that the country had too, and that now we could repair the breach and move forward together.
He felt, he really believed, that he had this chance to build this bridge to the 21st century, and that we had to do certain things that would help all people to get there.
NARRATOR:
As Clinton strode triumphantly down Pennsylvania Avenue flush with victory, there was no hint that he had already set in motion events that would soon divide the country as never before and nearly destroy his presidency.
NARRATOR:
Buoyed by his convincing reelection,
Bill Clinton sailed confidently into his second term.
The economy was booming, lifting millions of people into better jobs, better homes and better lives.
We have much to be thankful for.
With four years of growth, we have won back the basic strength of our economy.
With crime and welfare rolls declining, we are winning back our optimism, the enduring faith that we can master any difficulty.
NARRATOR:
Around the world,
American prestige and power had never been higher.
Even Clinton's longing to "repair the breach"
with Republicans seemed possible.
PETER KING:
It was two different worlds.
1997, beginning of Bill Clinton's second term, was totally different from the first term.
It was American politics the way it should be.
A Republican Congress working with the Democratic president, trying to find areas they would agree on, the hatred toward Bill Clinton was gone.
The hatred toward Hillary Clinton was gone.
Things had finally quieted down.
But in Bill Clinton's life, things never stay quiet for long.
NARRATOR:
By early 1997, at great risk to himself and his presidency,
Bill Clinton had been carrying on his affair with Monica Lewinsky for over a year.
REICH:
I've asked myself a number of times why he put himself and his presidency in jeopardy in such a careless way.
The presidency is probably the loneliest office in America.
Regardless of your friends, regardless of how good your marriage is, regardless of anything, you are alone there at the top.
And maybe Bill Clinton, who so much needed and wanted to be loved, couldn't say no to someone who was going to give him affection and wanted affection back.
MARLA CRIDER:
There is something in his being that needs that adoration.
And she was forthcoming with it.
And she, Monica Lewinsky, just gave him something that he needed at that time:
to be adored.
NARRATOR:
The previous spring, Lewinsky's superiors in the White House had begun to notice her attraction to the president.
Quietly, she was transferred to a job across town at the Pentagon.
There, Lewinsky befriended a career civil servant named Linda Tripp.
Like Lewinsky, Tripp had come to the Pentagon after years working at the White House, first in the Bush administration and then, less happily, in Clinton's.
JEFFREY TOOBIN:
Linda Tripp didn't like the Clinton people.
She didn't like their politics, she didn't like their personalities, she didn't like their social lives, and she simmered with resentments.
And she finds this young woman a couple cubicles away,
Monica Lewinsky, who decides to cry on her shoulder.
LUCIANNE GOLDBERG:
It was very much a big sister-little sister, mother-daughter relationship.
Monica would tell her everything.
Linda genuinely cared about Monica, but there was one overriding emotion, and that was what Bill Clinton was doing.
And...
I'm telling you, this was an angry woman.
NARRATOR:
Shortly before meeting Lewinsky,
Tripp had approached conservative literary agent Lucianne Goldberg about writing a tell-all book on the Clinton White House, but the project had gone nowhere.
In the fall of 1997, she contacted Goldberg with a new project:
the true story of an ongoing affair between a White House intern and the president of the United States.
GOLDBERG:
She called me and she said,
"He's having an affair with a girl who's 23 years old."
And I said, "Yeah, yeah."
You know, the kind of agenting that I did,
I heard a lot of wild stuff, and people have to prove things.
So she said,
"No, I'm not kidding you, he's having an affair with... and I know the girl and I talk to her every day."
And I said, "Well, can you prove this?
"Do you have pictures, is she willing to step forward, is she willing to go on theToday showand say...?"
And she said, "Well, no, I'm sure she wouldn't.
This is a big secret."
I said, "Well, you've got to...
"you've got to do something to prove to me
"so I can prove to a publisher that this... this wild story is true."
And I said, "You say you talk to her every day.
How about taping your phone conversations?"
And she agreed that that would be a cool idea and she went to RadioShack and bought a tape recorder and plugged it into her phone.
MONICA LEWINSKY (on tape):
Linda, I don't know why I have these feelings for him.
I never expected to feel this way about him.
And the first time I ever looked into his eyes close up and was with him alone, I saw somebody totally different than I had expected to see.
And that's the person I fell in love with.
GOLDBERG:
Linda wanted the world to know about this, and I think the motivation was no... you know, no deeper, no more shallow than that.
That was it.
She wanted the world to know about this relationship.
GORMLEY:
She came to believe that fate did call her to expose these defects in this president to the country.
On the other hand, she becomes entwined in a scandal that she helped to create.
LEWINSKY (on phone):
He was supposed to call me again.
I wasn't home and I was afraid to call.
TRIPP:
What happened?
LEWINSKY:
I don't know.
I saw him for 60 seconds.
TRIPP:
So how was it?
LEWINSKY:
I mean, we hug, and I gave him the paperweight.
TRIPP:
So, what did you wear?
GOLDBERG:
I knew if the story broke huge that people would start calling Linda, and Linda would say,
"Call my agent."
And they would call her agent, and her agent would make a book deal, and then would make some money, and she would get a little money and I would get ten percent of it, and that's the way the world works.
NARRATOR:
Goldberg suggested Tripp reach out toNewsweek's Michael Isikoff.
Before long, the two were having regular conversations.
MICHAEL ISIKOFF:
She would kind of tease me and she told me early on that there was a woman, who had been an intern, and that she was having an ongoing affair with Bill Clinton.
I was taken aback, as anybody would be.
So, I wanted to get Linda Tripp to tell me as much as she could.
And so I kept talking to her.
NARRATOR:
Linda Tripp was not just talking to Isikoff.
She had also begun sharing her story with the independent counsel investigating the Clintons.
By 1997, after more than two years,
Kenneth Starr's investigation into Whitewater had stalled.
Short on evidence or reliable witnesses, he had too little to bring charges against the president or first lady.
We know that they were running out of gas, and running out of rope, and had just about completely failed, until Monica came along.
NARRATOR:
In early January 1998,
Starr's office received a phone call from Tripp.
She revealed the existence of her tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky.
At first, Starr saw little value in the tapes.
A presidential affair, no matter how sordid, was not illegal.
But there was something in Tripp's story that caught Starr's attention:
the president had asked his friend Vernon Jordan to help find Lewinsky a job in the private sector.
Could this be an attempt, Starr wondered, to buy Lewinsky's silence?
LEWINSKY:
I'm just...
I'm starting to get a little nervous about Vernon.
TRIPP:
Why?
LEWINSKY:
I just want everything to be easy.
I want him to call me and say,
"You know, how does this amount of money, doing this here sound?"
And I say, "That sounds great."
He says, "Okay, consider it a done deal."
NARRATOR:
Clinton had good reason to worry about whether Lewinsky would keep their affair secret.
She had just been subpoenaed to testify in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the president brought by a former Arkansas state worker named Paula Jones.
Tipped off to the affair, Jones's lawyers believed the president's relationship with Lewinsky would demonstrate a pattern of behavior.
JAMES FISHER:
I thought it showed
President Clinton's proclivity to make sexual advances to extremely young, low-level employees, and President Clinton had obtained jobs for Monica Lewinsky as part of his effort to control her.
Highly relevant to Paula Jones' case.
NARRATOR:
Ken Starr was watching the Jones lawsuit with great interest.
If Clinton was trying to influence Lewinsky's testimony, he would be committing a major crime.
Suddenly, Starr glimpsed a bridge from Whitewater to a potentially more fruitful area of investigation.
GORMLEY:
The bridge is that the president and those close to him may be encouraging Monica lie in the Paula Jones case and therefore suborning perjury.
That's the little connection they make.
It's tenuous at this point, but they go for it.
NARRATOR:
With Starr's determined efforts, three seemingly unrelated threads from Clinton's past and present--
Whitewater, Paula Jones, and Monica Lewinsky-- had suddenly come together in one potentially devastating investigation.
And a single reporter threatened to upend the whole thing.
ISIKOFF:
I knew we had a blockbuster of a story.
And, of course, I had to call Starr's team.
And fair to say that when I did, they freaked out.
They realized that were I to publish a story, it would blow their investigation wide open.
NARRATOR:
Starr hoped to convince Lewinsky to secretly tape-record the president before Isikoff's story tipped him off.
On January 16, he sent Linda Tripp to meet with Lewinsky at a food court at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
Before the friends sat down, FBI agents swooped in.
TOOBIN:
The FBI grabs Monica in front of the Cinnabon and takes her upstairs in the Ritz-Carlton and tries to get her to flip.
But Monica basically just drives them crazy with her histrionics, with her refusal to talk.
They felt like one of these scenes in a movie where a bunch of grown men are trying to change the diapers of a baby and don't know how to do it.
Monica's crying, she's kind of wailing out loud.
What they weren't counting on, what they hadn't figured out is,
"So what do we do when Monica is not going to tell us whether she had an affair with Bill Clinton?"
NARRATOR:
Unable to secure Lewinsky's cooperation against the president, Starr still had a card to play.
The next day, January 17, 1998,
Clinton was scheduled to give his deposition under oath in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
If he lied about his affair with Lewinsky,
Starr would be able to bring a charge of perjury.
GOLDBERG:
He was about to testify, and they knew he was going to lie about Monica and that was, if you want to call it, the trap.
"And when a man is asked about this,
"a married man is asked about this, he's going to lie.
"And once he lies, we got him.
We got him!"
The whole purpose is to get the president.
If you're not out to get the president, you should say to the president,
"You know, you're going to testify in this lawsuit.
"You know, we know about your relationship with Monica Lewinsky."
They're trying to trap him into committing perjury.
WOMAN:
You may show the witness definition number one.
NARRATOR:
Barred from questioning the president himself,
Starr had to rely on Paula Jones's lawyers.
Lead attorney Jim Fisher began the deposition by introducing a definition of sexual relations taken from a federal statute.
FISHER:
In an effort to avoid ambiguity,
I thought I would use a definition that was well grounded in federal law.
So I thought there could be no doubt that these were unambiguous definitions for which the law had a well-recognized meaning.
NARRATOR:
Fisher's efforts to avoid ambiguity had the opposite effect, leaving Clinton a loophole through which to escape.
FISHER:
So the record is completely clear, have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky as that term is defined in deposition Exhibit 1?
I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
I've never had an affair with her.
If they had simply asked him,
"Did Monica Lewinsky ever perform oral sex on you?"
the gig would have been up.
Instead, they gave him this ridiculously complicated, hard-to-understand definition of sex, which allowed him to parse.
If I could have done it over again,
I would have just asked the salacious questions.
I would have let him have it.
I was trying to be respectful, and I paid a price for it.
Having said that, he clearly didn't answer the questions honestly.
If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie?
It's certainly not the truth.
It would not be the truth.
The turning point was when I started to ask him about gifts that he had given to her and she had given to him.
And I described some of them quite specifically.
There was a book of poetry by Walt Whitman, for example.
I thought his mood changed visibly at that point.
His face became bright red.
There was tension in his face.
GORMLEY:
He knew at this point there was a mole.
There was a rat in the woodpile.
Someone has given all of this damning information to these people.
He was in trouble.
NARRATOR:
Clinton's secret affair with Monica Lewinsky was now hurtling toward public exposure.
The very day that the president was deposed in the Jones lawsuit,
Michael Isikoff filed his story on the Lewinsky affair.
But at the last minute, his editors atNewsweek backtracked and decided to kill the story.
ISIKOFF:
Obviously, we had an enormous scoop here that was going to shake Washington.
Some of my colleagues and some of the editors agreed, but at the end of the day, the brass atNewsweek just were not willing to pull the trigger.
Michael told me.
He said, "They aren't going to run with it.
"They're afraid of it, they don't like it.
Nasty stuff, they don't want to do it."
And I said, "Well, what am I going to do?
I'm sitting on this thing."
NARRATOR:
In her frustration,
Goldberg turned to an Internet gossip columnist named Matt Drudge.
GOLDBERG:
A couple of people said,
"Call Matt Drudge."
I said, "Well, tell him to call me."
So at 11:00 that night, he called me and that was it.
It went kaboom!
The president, the intern, the accusations, and the denials.
REPORTER:
The allegations that the president had an illicit affair with a 21-year-old intern and then attempted to cover it up blasted through the White House today.
This scandal could unravel the administration.
NARRATOR:
Over the next 72 hours, the story made its way around the world.
(speaking French, German, Russian)
NARRATOR:
Caught unawares,
Clinton's cabinet members rushed to his defense.
I believe that the allegations are completely untrue.
I'll second that.
BAKER:
Aides who had worked for him for five, six years at this point are just on the floor.
They can't figure out what they're supposed to think about this, much less what they're supposed to do about this.
REICH:
I was convinced that Bill Clinton had been set up.
He's got all these enemies who are out to get him.
He wouldn't be so stupid as to jeopardize his entire presidency.
For what?
No, that was not the Bill Clinton I knew.
NARRATOR:
Clinton did confide in the one person he knew would not judge him.
MORRIS:
When the Lewinsky scandal broke, the president paged me and I returned the call.
And he said,
"Ever since I got here to the White House,
"I've had to shut my body down-- sexually, I mean--
"but I screwed up with this girl.
"I didn't do what they said I did, but I may have done so much that I can't prove my innocence."
And I said to him,
"The problem that presidents have is not the sin,
"it's the cover-up, and you should explore just telling the American people the truth."
He said, "Really, do you think I could do that?"
And I said, "Let me test it, let me run a poll."
So I took a poll and I tested popular attitudes on that and I called him back and I said,
"They will forgive the adultery, but they won't easily forgive that you lied."
JIM LEHRER:
Mr. President, welcome.
Thank you, Jim.
NARRATOR:
Clinton disregarded Morris's advice.
In interviews days after the story broke, he continued to hide his relationship with Lewinsky.
The news of this day is that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is investigating allegations that you suborned perjury by encouraging a 24-year-old woman, a former White House intern, to lie under oath in a civil deposition
about her having had an affair with you.
Mr. President, is that true?
That is not true.
That is not true.
I did not ask anyone to tell anything other than the truth.
There is no improper relationship.
And I intend to cooperate with this inquiry.
But that is not true.
He says, quite indignantly,
"There is no relationship with Monica Lewinsky."
And people begin to focus on the words.
"He said 'is,' didn't he?
He didn't say 'was.'"
What is he trying to say here?
Is he parsing here?
MIKE McCURRY:
I didn't notice the peculiar tense issue until later.
But I did think to myself, I said,
"Boy, there's got to be a stronger denial of this."
And I think some group of us said,
"Look, you're denying this, you've got to be strong.
"You've got to get out there and say, you know, how outrageous this is."
And, of course, I think that was dreadful advice in retrospect.
I want you to listen to me.
I'm going to say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.
I never told anybody to lie.
Not a single time.
Never.
These allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the American people.
Thank you.
GOLDBERG:
I was watching with a friend in my office and I said,
"That is it.
"This man is dead meat.
"That is it, because I know that he's lying,
"and if I know that he's lying, then the rest of the world is going to know he's lying."
FISHER:
When he went on the air and shook his finger and said,
"I never had sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky,"
and we knew he had, we realized then that this had the potential to literally change the course of American history.
STARR:
The one thing that we can't deal with are lies.
Lies are impossible to deal with, so please, simply tell us the truth.
The truth has a very powerful way of coming out, so let's get it out.
But clearly that was not the road that we were on.
NARRATOR:
Having set off on a course of deception, there was no turning back.
Clinton continued to press his lie, even to Hillary.
BAKER:
He tells her it's not true.
He tells her that Monica Lewinsky was a troubled young woman, that he had just tried to be nice to her, to mentor her in some ways.
And that's a story that Hillary Clinton hangs onto like a life raft.
NARRATOR:
The day after Clinton's denial,
Hillary appeared on national television.
I just think that a lot of this is deliberately designed to sensationalize charges against my husband because everything else they've tried has failed.
She focused her energy and her anger and her ire at the external enemies-- at Ken Starr, at the press, at the Republicans in Congress.
They were the ones who were doing this, not her husband.
The great story here, for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it, is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.
BAKER:
She says, "This is all about the vast right-wing conspiracy,"
and in that moment sort of sets the tone for the defense of the president against these charges.
NARRATOR:
To the Clintons, the Lewinsky scandal was just the latest front in a war waged by their political enemies to destroy them.
PENN:
The Lewinsky scandal was not really the Lewinsky scandal.
It was really an attempt by the Republican Party to have a coup d'état based on having discovered the president's personal behavior.
NARRATOR:
This time, however, even some allies of the Clintons found their protestations hollow.
O'DONNELL:
You can never blame your enemies for doing what your enemies will predictably do.
You can only blame yourself for what you have given to your enemies.
If you've given them absolutely nothing, guess what they're going to be able to do...
Nothing.
NARRATOR:
As the scandal raged around him,
Clinton did his best to focus, he said,
"On the job the American people hired me to do."
BAKER:
He's coming to work every day, he says, and he's going to do the job that's in front of him.
Privately, behind the scenes, it's a completely different story.
Of course he's obsessed by this.
Of course he's consumed by this.
Of course he is distracted.
He has a meeting with the head of the World Bank, for instance, who goes back to his office and then calls Clinton's chief of staff and says, "It's like he wasn't even there."
NARRATOR:
The president swung wildly between emotional extremes, from fear to fury.
KLEIN:
I think that there was always a part of him that wondered about the dark side and about whether he was really a bad person and whether he was going to be taken down.
But he also had-- and it's possible to have these two feelings simultaneously-- an overpowering sense of his own righteousness.
NARRATOR:
"I feel like a character in the novelDarkness at Noon,"
Clinton told an aide.
"I am surrounded by an oppressive force that is creating a lie about me and I can't get the truth out."
In fact, the truth was closing in.
All he can do is buy time.
All he can do is hope Starr doesn't have the goods, doesn't have the evidence, that there's no physical evidence that could prove it.
NARRATOR:
Before long, Starr had his physical evidence.
In July, Monica Lewinsky reached a deal to give her testimony in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
As part of the deal, she turned over a blue dress stained with Clinton's semen.
The next day, seeing no way out,
Clinton himself agreed to answer questions before Starr's grand jury.
Before the president faced Starr, however, he had to face Hillary.
That morning, Clinton awoke the first lady from a deep sleep.
Pacing the room, he finally confessed he had lied.
It was probably the most shattering moment in her life.
He'd lied to her and he'd used her.
He'd let her go out and essentially make alibis for him.
And it not only jeopardized everything they'd worked for all their lives, but totally humiliated her and Chelsea, and she couldn't trust him anymore.
NARRATOR:
Later that day,
Clinton's deposition was scheduled to take place in the Map Room of the White House.
The president's lawyers had won an important concession from Ken Starr:
the interrogation could not last longer than four hours.
MAN:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
Could you please state your full name for the record, sir.
William Jefferson Clinton.
GORMLEY:
Bill Clinton's strategy was to run out the clock.
And so, he would start talking about little stories from Arkansas.
He would, you know, take an aside and give a lecture about justice and the American dream.
And all along, the clock is ticking out.
Let me begin with the correct answer:
I don't know for sure.
Well, it would depend upon the facts.
I think on the whole, people in the uniformed civil service...
If we circle number one...
this is my circle here.
I remember doing it so I could focus only on those two lines...
It depends upon what the meaning of the word "is" is.
GORMLEY:
The Starr prosecutors walked out of that grand jury testimony totally demoralized.
They knew they had been clobbered by President Clinton.
And even though it was just obvious what he was doing, it was a masterful performance on Clinton's part.
NARRATOR:
If Clinton could finagle his way out of Starr's legal trap, he could not, he knew, escape the judgment of the American people.
DIRECTOR:
And we've got about 45.
NARRATOR:
That night, President Bill Clinton addressed the nation in one of the most unusual and anticipated broadcasts in American history.
Stand by.
Five seconds...
Good evening.
This afternoon, in this room, from this chair,
I testified before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury.
I answered their questions truthfully, including questions about my private life, questions no American citizen would ever want to answer.
Still, I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both public and private.
And that is why I am speaking to you tonight.
Indeed I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate.
In fact, it was wrong.
NARRATOR:
For many of those closest to Clinton, this was the first time they'd heard him admit the affair, and they were deeply hurt.
ICKES:
People just shook their heads.
They couldn't believe it.
They literally could not believe it.
What a squandering of talent and promise and possibility.
Yes, I felt betrayed.
He lied to me, yeah.
He lied to a lot of people about that, not least of whom was himself.
BAKER:
The morning after his grand jury testimony and his speech to the nation, he and Hillary and Chelsea head off to Martha's Vineyard for their annual vacation.
It may be the worst-timed family vacation in the history of the world, but there they are, heading out to the helicopter on the South Lawn.
And the staff is sitting in the White House thinking,
"What are we going to do about the walk to the helicopter?"
They decide they can't do anything.
They can't orchestrate it, they can't spin it;
they are powerless to affect it.
And in the end it falls to Chelsea Clinton, a teenager, to take both of their hands, on her own initiative, take her father's hand in one, her mother's hand in another and walk across the lawn,
literally the bridge between her parents at this moment of crisis between them.
NARRATOR:
As the Clintons spent a tense vacation on Martha's Vineyard,
Washington was abuzz with talk of resignation or even impeachment.
GORMLEY:
At this moment, he was in maximum peril.
Clinton's advisors were acutely aware that President Nixon was driven out of office not by the opposing party but by his own party when the Republicans came to him and said,
"Enough, you have to leave."
That's when President Nixon resigned.
And so there was real concern that Democrats were going to begin bolting, and they were not returning President Clinton's calls.
They were not happy with this.
There was a real concern that this could be the beginning of the end.
NARRATOR:
It had been a quarter of a century since Richard Nixon had resigned the presidency rather than endure an impeachment.
Now, many were urging Clinton to do the same.
But Clinton had no such intentions.
ISIKOFF:
There were the inevitable comparisons between Nixon and Clinton.
I always thought there was a fundamental difference.
Both Nixon and Clinton were convinced that it was their political enemies that were responsible for all their troubles.
The difference is that Nixon always suspected that his political enemies were better than him.
Clinton hated his political enemies and was convinced they were beneath him.
And that was the reason, at the end of the day,
Clinton was never going to do what Richard Nixon did, which was to give in to them and resign.
Yes, go ahead.
REPORTER:
Mr. President, all these questions about your personal life have to be painful to you and your family.
At what point do you consider that it's just not worth it and you consider resigning from office?
(light laughter)
Never.
You know, I was elected to do a job.
I think the American people know two or three things about me now that they didn't know the first time... this kind of effort was made against me.
I think they know that I care very much about them, that I care about ordinary people whose voices aren't often heard here.
And I think they know I have worked very, very hard for them.
NARRATOR:
Hard work had always been Clinton's salvation in moments of vulnerability.
Now, as he sought to show the American people he could still function, he bore down on a suddenly violent foreign policy crisis.
(explosion, sirens wailing)
Early on the morning of August 7, 1998, two truck bombs exploded simultaneously outside U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya.
The death toll reached 200, with another 5,000 injured.
Within hours, the FBI had pegged responsibility to a little-known terrorist organization called Al Qaeda.
Clinton soon ordered his national security team to hunt down and destroy Al Qaeda and its elusive leader, Osama Bin Laden.
CLARKE:
CIA had information-- it thought it was reliable information-- that Bin Laden and the Al Qaeda leadership were going to come together at a certain camp, in Afghanistan, at a certain date, at a certain time.
We went to the president and said,
"We want to be able to land cruise missiles at that camp while they're there."
NARRATOR:
The order would have huge political risks.
Clinton knew that it would be widely seen as an attempt to distract the public from his own personal problems.
CLARKE:
Somebody said something about,
"Well, you know, we have to take into account the political realities in the United States at the moment."
Which was sort of code words for,
"You've got this Monica Lewinsky scandal going on."
And he snapped.
He just very quickly and sharply said,
"You don't think about that.
"You think about national security.
"You give me the national security advice
"you would give me if this were not going on.
You letme worry about that."
NARRATOR:
On August 20, Clinton ordered a series of missile strikes against Al Qaeda, targeting training camps in Afghanistan and a plant in Sudan that the administration claimed was involved in making chemical weapons.
The missiles narrowly missed their main target.
CLARKE:
We didn't kill Bin Laden.
We didn't have that to show for the attack.
And people, frankly, a lot of people in the Congress and in the media said this was just an attempt to "wag the dog."
The timing of all of this is more than coincidental, and I think it may very well run the risk... the president may run the risk of having an even more cynical view of his behavior.
CLARKE:
He knew that.
He knew that was going to happen.
He knew it would make it worse for him to do this.
But he launched the attack because he thought it was the right national security thing to do.
That's what we told him.
And he said, "I'll do it anyway, even though it makes it worse for me."
NARRATOR:
Things were deteriorating quickly for the president.
On September 9, Kenneth Starr finally delivered to Congress the long-awaited results of his investigation.
In 450 pages of sometimes salacious detail,
Starr laid out his case against Clinton for perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of office in the Lewinsky affair, while dropping almost all reference to his original investigation of Whitewater.
STARR:
Lawyers are thorough.
Good lawyers are thorough.
There could be absolutely no gap whatsoever between the facts and then a reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts.
The case had to be proven.
MALE REPORTER:
The House Sergeant at Arms officially unsealed the document at mid-afternoon.
It had been advertised as steamy, and you could almost see the steam rising as the boxes came open.
FEMALE REPORTER:
According to the sources, the report focuses almost entirely on the president's relationship with Lewinsky.
However this turns out, it is a turning point in Mr. Clinton's presidency.
It is not an exaggeration to say that he has less control of his destiny than at any time since he was elected.
NARRATOR:
The Starr report was a turning point, but not in the way the independent counsel or his Republican supporters had expected.
Polls showed that after four years and $40 million, most Americans believed the investigations against Clinton were more persecution than prosecution.
ICKES:
The Republicans had so undercut their own credibility in the way they were going after him that people, although they deplored what he had done and thought it was stupid and it demeaned the office of the presidency and tarnished the presidency,
tarnished him and had been a devastating blow to Hillary and Chelsea and all those things that went through people's minds, they looked at the Republicans and they had enough already.
NARRATOR:
After the release of Starr's report,
Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden to offer his first full-throated apology to the American people.
I am profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds.
I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my friends or my family.
Quite simply, I gave in to my shame.
I have been condemned by my accusers with harsh words, and while it's hard to hear yourself called deceitful and manipulative,
I remember Ben Franklin's admonition that our critics are our friends, for they do show us our faults.
NARRATOR:
If Clinton was willing at last to take responsibility, the American people were willing to forgive him.
MYERS:
He disappoints them every time on some level, but he always gets up and tries to make it better.
You know, what else can you ask from a sinner, right?
And that's how he would define himself, "I'm a sinner.
"And I try to be better every time, and I learn from my mistakes and I go forward."
And I think the American public is pretty forgiving of a guy who sees himself as a sinner.
NARRATOR:
Weary of the attacks on Clinton,
Americans punished Republican candidates in the Congressional elections in November.
Upsetting precedent,
Democrats actually gained seats in Congress.
I think the message the American people sent was loud and clear:
we want progress over partisanship and unity over division.
NARRATOR:
Blamed for the defeat, Newt Gingrich resigned his post as speaker of the House of Representatives.
To the frustration of his Republican opponents,
Clinton seemed to have won over the American people again.
LOTT:
There are two or three things that I have witnessed in my political career that I never could figure out.
The fact that a lot of people didn't think that that was a serious problem that he, you know, perjured himself in his testimony, and that he'd had a relationship with that woman Monica Lewinsky--
that did shock me, and I've never quite figured out how in the world could that be that he'd come out the back end of it pretty much where he was at the beginning.
It's just one of those things I've never quite figured out.
BLANKLEY:
We should have seen that,
"Okay, we're personally offended, that's our condition."
But if the public isn't, and clearly they weren't, then get over it.
And we never got over it.
We never got over it.
We still haven't got over it.
NARRATOR:
Determined to punish the president,
House Republicans, led by Texas congressman Tom DeLay, played their last card:
impeachment.
A resolution impeaching William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.
The Republicans were gripped by just unreasoning hatred of Bill Clinton.
They just despised the man and could not stand that he was going to get away with this.
MAN:
"Article One:
In his conduct
"while president of the United States,
"William Jefferson Clinton,
"in violation of his Constitutional oath
"faithfully to execute the office
"of president of the United States,
"has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial process of the United States..."
NARRATOR:
On Saturday, December 19, the House of Representatives voted along party lines to impeach the president on two of four counts involving obstruction of justice and perjury.
On this vote, the yeas are 228, the nays are 206.
Article one is adopted.
NARRATOR:
Bill Clinton had become only the second president in American history, and the first in more than a century, to be impeached by the House.
The American people,
I call them to my side here at the podium to verify to you that the president committed falsehoods under oath.
NARRATOR:
Republican leaders moved the proceedings to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority was required to convict the president and remove him from office.
The Senate will convene as a court of impeachment.
We are here today because President William Jefferson Clinton decided to put himself above the law.
This is not about sex.
This is about obstruction of justice.
This is about a pattern, this is about a scheme, this is about a lot of lies.
NARRATOR:
For three long weeks, with little hope of success, 13 Republican congressmen pressed the case against Clinton.
This is not about sexual misconduct any more than Watergate was about a third-rate burglary.
NARRATOR:
Finally, Arkansas Democratic Senator Dale Bumpers rose to express the sentiments felt by many in the chamber and the country as a whole.
We are here today because the president suffered a terrible moral lapse.
A marital infidelity, not a breach of the public trust, not a crime against society.
It is a sex scandal.
H.L. Mencken said one time,
"When you hear somebody say, 'This is not about money,' it's about money."
(laughter)
And when you hear somebody say, "This is not about sex,"
it's about sex.
The Senate adjudges that the respondent,
William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, is not guilty as charged in the first article of impeachment.
NARRATOR:
What had begun with a sexual indiscretion more than three years earlier and mushroomed into a full-scale constitutional crisis was finally over.
This time, however, there was no triumph, no crowing about "The Comeback Kid."
Bill Clinton knew that this time, both he and the country had paid a heavy price.
HARRIS:
Bill Clinton, in his second inaugural address, said it was his ambition during the second term to be, quoting scripture, "a repairer of the breach."
That ambition was not realized in his second term and it effectively died in 1998, the year of scandal.
MYERS:
The fact that the president was impeached will always be part of his story, part of his legacy.
It consumed a tremendous amount of energy.
It undercut his standing and, I think, limited his ability to accomplish anything outside of surviving for almost two years.
And, you know, that's tragic.
MARANISS:
Clinton created many of his own problems, but his enemies exaggerated, enhanced, mythologized, lied, were utterly hypocritical in their attacks on him.
You know, to the extent that I believe that every human being is responsible for their own lives, he holds the responsibility for it.
To the extent that context shapes a life, his enemies have a lot to answer for.
NARRATOR:
Clinton had survived, but the impeachment ordeal seemed to have sapped much of his drive and ambition.
BAKER:
President Clinton has more than 700 days left in office after he is acquitted by the Senate, and he promises to use every single one of them to its fullest.
But the constraints were enormous at that point.
The big aspirations were gone.
The chances of reinventing Social Security or reinventing Medicare just proved too elusive.
He had a Congress which had just literally put him on trial, and was not willing to do a lot of business with him.
NARRATOR:
In 2000, Clinton came tantalizingly close to the great historical achievement for which he had yearned, but a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in the 11th hour.
The same year, after decades of budget deficits, the federal budget had a surplus of nearly $240 billion, an accomplishment for which Clinton was given much credit.
It was only as her husband was preparing to leave the stage that Hillary finally stepped front and center, ready at last to take her star turn.
BAKER:
The day the Senate votes to acquit President Clinton on impeachment charges,
Hillary Clinton is meeting in the White House residence with Harold Ickes to plot a campaign for the very same United States Senate.
Literally the end of his crisis is the birth of her new phase.
SHEEHY:
She said, "I want to be independent.
I want to be judged on my own merits."
And she finally released herself from, you know, the shadow of Bill Clinton over her and began making her own decisions.
He then came to her support, and there was nobody more of a champion for her Senate race than Bill Clinton.
He was behind her all the way.
So even if I didn't know her better than anybody in this room,
I'd be for her.
NARRATOR:
That November, as Vice-President Al Gore lost the closest presidential election in American history,
Hillary Clinton easily won the Senate seat in New York.
I am profoundly grateful to all of you for giving me the chance to serve you.
NARRATOR:
In his final round of goodbye speeches,
Bill Clinton even bid farewell to the Washington press corps.
You know, I read in the history books how other presidents say the White House is like a penitentiary and that every motive they have is suspect.
Even George Washington complained he was treated like a common thief.
And they all say they can't get away... can't wait to get away.
I don't know what the heck they're talking about.
(audience laughs)
I've had a wonderful time.
It's been an honor to serve and fun to laugh.
I only wish that we'd even laughed more these last eight years, because power's not the most important thing in life and only counts for what you use it.
BAKER:
Bill Clinton loved being president.
He had to literally be dragged out of there, clawing the floors to get him out of there on January 20, 2001.
In fact, when the Bushes show up, the movers are still desperately trying to move everything;
literally, they're taking drawers from the cabinets and just dumping them into boxes because Bill Clinton has wanted to milk every last minute of his presidency right up to the end.
THOMASON:
Listen, this guy loved being president.
He even loved being president when it was tough.
And a lot of times I would say, "How does he smile?
"How does he keep laughing?
How does he keep going through this?"
But it was because he got the energy back from the people.
Whatever you think of the man, he wanted to do the right thing for the people of his county, his state, his country, and that never changed about him.
NARRATOR:
Clinton departed the White House for the last time on Saturday, January 20, 2001.
In the end, he left much as he had come:
a man loved by his friends and loathed by his enemies;
a politician who had achieved a great deal, yet left behind a curious sense of unfulfilled promise.
HARRIS:
I believe he's an argument without end, that there will be people discussing and debating the significance of Bill Clinton for a long time.
CHAFE:
Bill Clinton will be remembered as one of our best presidents in the 20th century, who accomplished an enormous amount, and he will be remembered because of his personal recklessness.
And that is tragic, because so much more could have happened.
REICH:
Did Bill Clinton help the country, and was the country better for having him as president?
I think unquestionably yes.
But are there elements of tragedy here as well?
Huge elements of tragedy in terms of failures and opportunities lost, and risks made that didn't have to be made?
Undoubtedly.
KLEIN:
I know a lot of people think that Clinton's presidency was a wasted opportunity.
But he came to office in 1992 and left a stronger country in 2000.
I don't know if you can say of a president who served us well and improved our material good that it was a wasted opportunity.
And it was sure a lot of fun to watch.

We're gonna get you out of that mint green thing you're wearing and into a flimsy negligee.
We're gonna pour water on the front.
Cynthia, I see us on a desert isle.
You, me, a portable water bed, it's beautiful.
Are you there?
Are you there with me?
it's beautiful.
There's the sun, there's the island, there's the water bed.
Ralph.
Cut the shit.
Get out of my chair.
I was on the verge here of a major breakthrough and you just blew it.
Ralph, the only thing you were on the verge of was bad taste.
Sit down.
Cynthia, I'm Dr. Carmen.
And I doubt if my welcome can equal
Ralph's, but I'll try.
This is the borderline personality group.
Welcome.
What is a borderline personality?
A borderline personality is when, it, um...
Well, borders on two very overused categories:
Psychotic, and neurotic.
-He's making this up.
-Go back to where you came from.
Go back to your nether-world.
He has touched you.
He will take you.
Thank you, Gilda.
As a personality syndrome, we've been exploring it for the past couple of years.
It includes identity crisis, um...
Chemical addiction, emotionalism, neuroses.
RALPH:
You forgot something.
Violent mood swings!
We're only violent when it's absolutely necessary.
If we're just about finished, I think we-
But we're not finished, Dr. Carmen, and they will not be finished until they make her feel as miserable and pathetic and confused as they are.
CYNTHIA:
I am confused.
You see?
I hope you're all very happy.
-Honey, honey, please-
-Abe, not here, please!
I thought we decided no touching in front of other people.
You decided that.
I didn't decide that.
You can't just do that to me when I need to touch you, you can't do it to me,
You can't, you can't, you can't!
Oops.
-The crazy crew.
-Crazy?
You said today's secret word.
There are no secrets here.
Excuse me, Dr. Carmen...
Um, I don't think I fit your description of a personality.
You don't belong here.
You're not one of us.
Didn't Dr. Berrisford explain why you're here?
He said that he thought that this would help me fit into the eighties.
You want to fit into the eighties, you're at least two divorces, a condo, and a yeast infection behind the times.
Why don't you just stick to the seventies and move to Cleveland?
[LAUGHTER]
If I can offer a more practical suggestion,
-Why don't you just talk?
-Talk?
About something close to you.
Why don't you just quit fucking beating around the bush and ask her?
Just ask her!
-Do you have to be so crude?
-Shut up.
Come on, Cynthia, dish out the dirt.
Tell us about the commune.
You know, the last gasp of the age of Aquarius.
Building a better future on what?
Chemistry?
Good vibrations?
Tie-dyeing your undies?
Don't talk to her.
She's a reporter.
She writes stories about Elvis zombies from outer space.
They were from Atlantis.
I had pictures.
Shut up.
Just tell us about the orgies, Cynthia.
-She was a child at the time.
-So?
I'm sorry, I do not have any stories like that.
But I will tell you what I do remember.
What we felt.
What we believed was that if people could become selfless enough, if they could free themselves from their egos,
They would experience a kind of togetherness.
A oneness.
A Unity.
That is where the name came from.
We had a dream about a perfect society based on love and trust.
We weren't trying to change the world, we were just trying to love each other as much as we could.
Bullshit.
No!
It's not bullshit!
It's beautiful. it's beautiful.
It's not bullshit.
(ON T. M) No!
It's not bullshit!
it's beautiful.
It's not bullshit.
Lana hasn't spoken to anyone for three weeks, and now love, peace, and Woodstock.
Am I missing something?
Yeah.
She's espousing a total belief system, Cynthia is.
Make a commitment, make a decision to love.
And you're healed.
You're made whole.
It's not a new idea, Alex
Get rid of the troublesome ego.
Pow!
Pow!
Pow!
Go, ego.
Run free.
I'm still not sure she belongs in the group.
You don't have to be sure, Alex.
You don't have to come to a decision.
You know, the important thing is that she recovers her memory.
Now she relates to you, she likes you for some reason.
I don't know why, but she does.
So let's just press on.
Alright?
Drop down to first gear, honey. it's Miller Time.
What are these?
Vitamins?
Beauty secrets from the Orient.
Look what they've done for me.
-Ralph.
-Hello!
You in a cooperative mood, or do I have to tie you up again?
Promises, promises.
Open.
Next time it'll be lower.
She's crazy about me.
Hey, I've got a great idea.
Why don't you come up to my room?
And I'll catch you up to date?
I got a hi-fi VHS VCR, a CD, and MTV.
I don't think so.
You know what I do when it all gets to be too much?
I make a little hole, and it all escapes.
Well, there's the assistant Ayatollah.
See you later.
Can I buy you some lunch?
I've been watching the others.
They belong here.
I don't.
And I'm feeling stronger, I'm getting used to things,
Like VCS's and MCD's.
I want to leave.
Cynthia, we've been trying to locate your family for years, and we haven't come up with anything.
Where would you go?
I'd find some people, like at Unity.
Cynthia, there aren't any more places like that.
And the fire that injured you took everything with it.
They're all gone.
I know that.
Yes, you do.
And I know this is a lot to take, but it's a buried memory and it needs to be uncovered, and put in the proper place in your mind.
Maybe it's something you could work on with the group.
Sooner or later, Cynthia, we all have to move on.
The sooner you do, the better.
Let's catch this.
Would somebody hit eight, please?
[GRINDING SOUND]
It stopped!
Great.
[ANGRY MUTTERING]
I think this is the fourth time this week.
Come on, why can't you fix this thing?
Come on, open it up!
[ALARM RINGING]
Excuse me.
[gasps] [scREAlvllNG]
Unity's coming here.
-Cynthia!
-Now and forever.
Come to us, Cynthia.
We love you.
You belong to us.
Forever.
Come to us, Cynthia.
We love you.
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Excuse me.
Coming through!
Cynthia!
He's in there.
He's in there.
He's in there.
He's in there.
Cynthia, what happened?
-He's alive.
He's in there.
-Who's in there?
He's in there.
He's alive.
He's in there.
Well, first off, we're gonna feel a little silly, and we're gonna look
-a little silly.
-I don't think it's silly.
I think it's really neat.
I'm glad.
But let's see if this technique can help release a little hidden aggression.
Alright, who's gonna go first?
-Lana?
-Hmm.
Um.
I was wondering how many helpless and defenseless geese had to die to fill up these pillows.
They're polyester, honey.
Alright, well let's do the first one all together.
All right?
Ready?
One, two, three!
[MUFFLED YELLING]
Outstanding.
Truly outstanding.
Alright, what are we feeling?
Gilda?
His power is transcendent.
The day of reckoning is at hand.
That's so weird.
That's exactly what I was feeling.
Ralph.
Miriam?
I was thinking about my first husband.
Or maybe the third.
What's the difference?
RALPH:
About four inches.
Cynthia?
I know it's hard.
Try to participate.
Alright.
Let's try this one again, only let's really let loose.
Miriam?
Ready?
One, two, three!
[MUFFLED SCREAMING]
[DRUM BEATS]
[DRUM BEATING FASTER]
Our love will never die.
[scREAlvllNG]
You fail me, Cynthia.
You failed us all.
All of us make the same journey.
But you made us wait all this time while you slept.
The waiting time is over, my love child.
Come to us.
[scREAlvllNG]
We were happy.
And we were going to make our break with the world.
'Cause...
'Cause it didn't like us, and, um...
Their
- Their faces, and there was, uh...
Gasoline.
He put gasoline on us.
And, um...
Somehow I knew it was wrong, and I ran, and...
There was this big wind that picked me up and threw me.
And then, I don't know, um...
When I opened my eyes, I was here.
Why wasn't any evidence found?
[DOOR CLOSING]
Jerry cans would have been burned up completely before anything else.
We knew there was an explosion.
We just didn't know how or why.
Well, Lieutenant.
You must be pleased to close the case after thirteen years.
Who said it was closed?
What do you mean by that?
Well, Sleeping Beauty here woke up.
She didn't remember anything about the thirty deaths.
So now she remembers.
It was a goddamn Jonestown.
A suicide pact.
Who knows what she'll remember tomorrow?
If she ran for her life like she says or that she though the whole thing was a nifty idea.
Hell...
Maybe she bought the damn gasoline and helped pour it on the babies.
-That's enough.
-That's out of line.
Please, if you don't mind.
Please.
That man's a candidate for shock therapy.
A jumper cable right up his ass.
No, he's right.
They expected me to keep my promise at Unity Fields.
And they still do.
Man, there's nothing like a hot shower, huh?
Mm.
Um, Cynthia.
Oh.
Are you alright?
-I thought that after today, that, um-
-I'm fine.
You know what?
There's a hole where my heart's supposed to be.
It's like it hurts here, because I'm empty.
Um, you know, what you were saying about togetherness and everything makes perfect
$9086 llo me.
Mm, you know, maybe there's a little hope for me, sort of.
I think you want to help people.
Not, um, not like some others.
Um, if you need a friend here...
All of my friends are dead.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, if you need, um, a friend, a new
- A new friend, um-
Please.
Will you just leave me alone?
-Um.
-Please.
Leave me alone.
[crying]
Lana, wait a second.
She didn't mean it!
Shit.
Look.
Look!
Lana may be a little weird, even for this place, but she means well.
I probably pull her chain too much, but she's reaching out.
We all are.
You should try to help her.
I can't help myself.
[WATER DRIPPING]
(OFF SCREEN) Cynthia.
Unity.
Unity.
Cynthia.
-Unity.
-Join us.
Come here, my child.
Cynthia, you're now part of the whole.
Embrace the unity of spirit before you.
Heart of the mind, soul of the self.
Spirit of the body.
Cleanse.
Cleanse.
Cleanse.
Cleanse.
Cleanse!
[GARBLED SCREAMING]
I warned you, Cynthia.
I warned you someone else would take your place.
[scREAlvllNG]
Bob!
We got a girl drowned in the pool.
Get her legs.
Get her legs up.
Come on.
She's got no breath.
-God!
-How long was she under?
[BELL RINGING] Did you see the police this morning?
They're all over the pool.
Fingerprints.
Photographs.
Yeah, next they're gonna have the fucking Coast Guard out here.
Lot of good that's gonna do Lana.
Ralph!
We are gonna start billing you for those outbursts.
Yeah, you bill us and our family for every goddamn aspirin!
You bill Lana for a body bag?
(OVER P.A.) Dr. Freeman to gynecology.
Dr. Freeman to gynecology.
[WHISPERINGJ
You are defenseless against him.
Shithead.
[GASPING] Jesus.
You can't blame yourself about Lana.
She was unhappy.
And sometimes unhappy people do stupid things.
She didn't kill herself.
Harris did it.
Harris?
From Unity Fields.
You don't believe me, do you?
I believe that you believe it.
But I also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie-jeebies isn't gonna do shit to solve your real problems.
No.
No.
We gotta get you out of here.
Get you to someplace nice.
Like at the beach, or in the mountains, where you can fight your demons in your own way, right?
I don't know anybody.
I don't have any money.
You know me.
Listen, I was on the staff of a national publication, and some people called it a rag but it was home to me.
Me Magazine, you've heard of it!
-I was in a coma.
-Oh, right.
Well, when they carried me off to this funny farm, Saul
- He's the editor
- He told me "You're welcome back any time,"
so maybe this is the time.
Look, look.
I could go to him.
I could tell him your story.
He would give me a huge advance.
I'd share it with you, we'd be set!
-I don't know.
-No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait.
Let me be honest with you, okay?
This is a good story.
It's a great story, and it could mean a second chance for me, so ok!
Ok!
There is a little bit of self interest here, alright?
But look!
I really think you should tell people about Unity Fields.
How they take decent ideas and dreams, and turn them into something sick and poisonous.
You owe it to the world.
You owe it to yourself, now you have to ask yourself.
This is my life.
Do I want to live, or do I want to die?
-I want to live.
-Okay!
We're in business.
I think I know a way to make a phone call.
We'll get you out of here tonight.
Cynthia, this is the right thing to do.
Of course it is.
You said so.
-Yes.
I did.
-Yes.
(OVER P.A.) Dr. Hillman, please call your office.
Uh-oh.
Get out your hall pass.
Ladies.
Nice to see you socializing, Cynthia.
Yes.
I'll see you later.
Thank you.
No.
Thank you.
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine.
Good.
No!
Miriam!
Miriam!
Stop!
Miriam.
He wants us all with him.
He wants us with him and whether we like it or not we're going.
Cynthia, we're all upset about what happened.
Harris promised us eternal bliss on the other side when we got there.
-Eternal bliss.
-Eternal bullshit.
Miriam was gonna write a story about me.
He killed her because she was gonna help me get out of here.
First off, Miriam was here because of an attempted suicide.
Several attempts, and Harris hasn't got anything to do with it.
You're not listening to me.
You are all gonna die.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
If I die, does my mom get a refund?
-Morning, Dr. B.
-Morning.
-Hey, here he is.
-Dr.
Berrisford!
[cl_AMoRING]
Dr. Berrisford, how are these suicides related?
-Was it a double suicide?
-No, no, no.
-These were tragic coincidences.
-But why did they kill themselves?
In borderline personality disorders there is a predisposition to suicidal tendencies.
[CLAMORING] Now, if you'll excuse me.
-What about the commune girl?
-Was it a mass suicide?
-Could she have killed them?
-Could it have been murder?
You're in pain, Cynthia.
Your pain is my pain.
We share it all.
Because we have our love.
And our love will never die.
-What are you doing here?
-Well, you know me at feeding time.
Don't make me take another friend.
Keep your promise, lovechild.
Join us.
No!
[SCREAMS] I didn't want you to be alone.
Looks like I was right.
We're so pathetic, rutting like rabbits.
I'm only doing it because in the morning
I can enjoy hating myself.
I'm only too glad to help.
They'll be doing a bed check soon.
I know a better place.
I know I've said this before, but I'm gonna say it again, and I'm gonna keep saying it until you believe it.
You're not responsible for what happened to Lana and Miriam.
And until you believe it, there's nothing I can do for you.
I'm lost, and confused, and concerned, and not just as a doctor.
What am I supposed to do, write you a prescription?
Oh, no!
You can't run away from this, Cynthia.
It's a filthy habit, Ed.
Disgusting.
What now?
-Looks like they went out again.
-Ok, excitement's over.
Why is it so difficult to keep the lights on around here?
Oh-h-h-h.
Mrs. Robertson, what are you doing up?
Here, put your hand up against the wall.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
It's just fine.
It's just overloaded circuits.
Please, everyone!
Go back to your rooms.
Upstairs?
Alright, alright.
There's something stuck in the turbine, I'll have it straight in just a minute.
Well, hurry.
It's just the lights went out.
Take a deep breath.
GHOSTLY VOICE:
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Connie?
Fuck.
Cynthia.
-We 're up here, Cynthia.
-Join us.
We love you.
What the hell?
[scREAlvllNG]
We 're up here.
Keep following us.
We love you.
Cynthia.
[THUMPING WITHIN AIR DUCT]
Join us.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Where are Connie and Ed?
-Cynthia?
-Where are Connie and Ed?
They're with us now.
Where are Connie and Ed?
[scREAlvllNG]
What the fuck is going on here?
!
We're not sure exactly.
We think they were drinking and they fell into the...
Main turbines.
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.
Is that supposed to be an explanation?
Huh, Dr. Dick?
Ed drank lots of times.
He did.
As a matter of fact, we used to share a bottle up on the terrace when you were at your
Save-the-Whale Meetings.
Oh, but he never wanted to jump in the goddamn Mixmaster, man.
There's something going on here.
Not something.
Someone.
Him.
Gilda, would you can it with your goddamn cosmic god shit?
-He has the power.
He calls us.
-I'm getting the fuck out of here.
Who're you?
Lieutenant Wasserman, assigned to you-
Yeah, yeah, shut up, I get the picture.
Try not to shoot me or your fat ass.
Ralph.
I have to leave.
Y'know, I thought you might need some company tonight. it's safest here, really.
The police are here.
I'm here.
We're gonna have a nice, boring evening tonight.
I even brought provisions.
Pure, unadulterated junk food.
At this point, who cares about chemicals?
Right?
Have you tried these?
Ever tried those?
They don't serve these here
Hey, dick?
Try harder next time.
Connie and Ed aren't going to be the last.
Yes, they are.
Everyone's protected, nothing can happen.
-Everything ok?
-Yeah, Officer, it's fine, thank you.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I got on your case earlier.
-Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
-Hell, why not?
You want cream or sugar?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
J' Regrets J'
J' I've had a few J'
J' But then again J'
J' Too few to whinge J'
J'ordoJ'
J' What I hope to do J'
J' I saw it through J'
[KNOCKING]
-Ralph.
-Um, hi.
How are you?
-Nice night, huh?
-What is it?
I just wanted to let you know that everything's going to be ok.
it's going to be alright.
Ralph.
Cynthia?
Ralph?
Dr. Carmen, have you seen Ralph?
I was gonna ask you the same question, Hettie.
With all this commotion from the power outage, he didn't take his six o'clock tranq.
-Shit!
He misses two in a row, you-
-Dr.
Carmen!
Where in the hell have you been?
Pesco, Ralph.
He's knocked out his bodyguard.
There's a trail of blood all the way down the hall.
He's got Cynthia!
This is Freddy!
We need backup, now.
And away we go!
I...
I think that we should go back upstairs
And we should talk to Doctor- Ah!
I'm sorry.
You're really making me nervous.
And I don't like it.
That was a little joke.
What are you laughing at?
Relax!
Come on!
Ralph, don't.
I don't think that we should go out there.
-I have to talk to you!
-I want to go back upstairs.
It's very important!
It's very, very important!
Very, very. very. very, very, very, very important!
It's very important that I talk to you!
Ralph, I don't think that you're being yourself.
Ha!
Not myself?
Not myself?
!
Who the fuck else am I supposed to be?
How are we gonna get out of here, Ralph?
Ralph.
I come down here a lot.
It helps me unwind.
Shit!
Fuck, this always worked before.
I've gotta calm down.
I gotta calm down.
I gotta calm down!
I gotta calm down!
They're in the sub-basement.
We have to take the stairs.
-Ralph's killed the elevator.
-Let's hope he stops there.
What did I want to talk to you about?
Oh right, right, right!
There are only a few chances in life for real glory, and most people fuck it off!
Most people- Most people can't even find their own noses on their fat faces!
You want an example?
Alright, how about every fucking doctor, every fucking patient in this entire fucking hospital?
Ralph?
Wouldn't you like to speak with a doctor?
I think you know what I'm talking about, Cynthia.
No, I don't, I don't.
You don't!
Fuckin' the great big gig in the sky, don't play dumb!
I think you know the word I'm searching for, Cynthia.
-HARRIS:
Cynthia...
-U-N-I-T-Y.
-Cynthia...
-Unity.
Join us, Cynthia!
In Unity.
In beautiful Unity.
-In Unity.
In the real world.
Join us.
-Cynthia...
HARRIS AND RALPH TOGETHER:
You belong to us.
Forever.
[SCREAMING] Join us.
-Hey!
-You alright?
-Drop those knives.
-Knives?
Knives?
These are not knives, these are fine surgical instruments.
-Don't make me hurt you.
-No!
You're right.
This is madness.
[scREAlvllNG]
[GASPING] Later.
You alright?
Okay, doctor.
My office, now?
Alex.
Alex, help me.
-What could I do?
-Help me, Alex.
What is it that you're implying, Lieutenant?
Fucking crazy people.
Who knows what they can do?
Do you imagine that she drowned Lana without getting wet?
You saw Ralph kill himself.
She was there every single time.
She's some kind of goddamn catalyst.
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out one way or another.
-Police custody is long overdue.
-Police custody.
You didn't think I belonged in the group from the beginning, did you?
-No, I didn't.
-Don't be hard on yourself, ok?
What?
I needed the group.
I needed to find out where I belonged.
I know.
It's with him.
Cynthia, I need you to come with me now, alright?
Nurse?
Let's go.
-Where are you taking her?
-Isolation.
Isolation?
The girl needs human contact, connection.
Isolation's the worst place in the world for her.
Well, the alternative is police custody.
No, the alternative is a court order.
There's not a judge in the-
You want this.
You want her on the edge.
You've wanted it since the beginning!
Alex, I know you're fond of this girl but you are out of line.
You want to see your theory played out.
Shh.
Alex.
Goodbye.
Thanks for trying, but it's time for me to go now.
Okay, honey.
Now you just relax.
We're just gonna take you someplace.
Did you hear that?
You're killing her with your theories.
Alex, this has nothing to do with theories.
Look at her.
Can't you understand and see she's estranged from herself?
Wouldn't matter if she was in the Mojave
Desert or the middle of New York City.
She's without will.
There's plenty of room for yours, right?
Now this has got to stop.
I'll release her into police custody if I can stay on as her physician.
It's alright with me.
Alex, your tenure with the clinic is over.
You can't do that!
You want to walk on your own?
Follow me.
[CLOCK TICKING]
-Would you like to come in?
-No, thank you.
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
(CYNTHIA, ON SCREEN) I'm sorry.
I understand where I am.
What are you saying?
No.
No.
But why?
-Why me?
-Because you are special, lovechild.
Don't you remember why?
-No.
-It will come to you in time.
Meanwhile, I will come to you.
Everything all right in here, honey?
Yes.
It's going to be beautiful.
Very soon.
I am not for this world.
But you are.
You can be.
Defy the other world.
Look to your heart.
Hey!
Better release some hidden aggression.
Feel better?
No?
Yes?
Maybe?
Officer, I'll write myself a prescription in the morning.
I knew you'd come.
But you're too late.
I warned her.
I told her what she had to do.
You won't get to her.
You won't get me.
[WHISTLING To RADIO]
[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING]
[GRuNTING]
You don't like the way I drive, Doctor Addictive Buttface?
Then stay out of the parking lot!
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Touchdown!
Oh.
I'm exerting my will, Doctor.
[SHOUTING]
-Are you ready for Unity?
-I'm so tired.
Can't you just kill me?
HARRIS:
No, my lovechild.
You must do it yourself.
-Carmen.
You look like shit.
-Yes, listen.
I need, um...
The scripts for the therapy group.
Forget about it, man.
I can't do that.
That's Berrisford's show.
He'd kill me if I did that.
-This is it, isn't it?
-It's the second drawer in the back.
Hey, have you seen that new nurse in Psychiatric?
She's unbelievable, man.
I'm telling you, I'm thinking about having myself committed.
Just so I can get close to her.
She's got the most unbelievable legs.
No, this- this is the standard stuff.
Of course it's the standard stuff.
What'd you expect, nuclear secrets?
You fill these prescriptions?
No, Berrisford does it himself every day.
Comes in in the morning, sets up the medication for the day and Hettie takes it when she needs it.
Yeah, well I need it now.
[GLASS SHATTERING]
What the fuck are you doin', man?
What're you doing?
You out of your mind?
-Have you lost your mind completely?
-Read this.
Pesco, Ralph.
Pesco is dead!
-Just help me read it!
What is it?
-Alright, just calm down!
Lithium, four times a day.
-Is this Lithium?
-No.
No, this is Berynthine.
This is the exact opposite of Lithium.
You give this to a normal person, he'd flip out.
Someone like Pesco, you can forget about it.
Listen, what is this, and this, and this?
Just move.
I'll tell you everything, alright?
Ok, these are dextroamphetamines.
You take one of these, you walk on the ceiling.
This is methylphenidate.
You take this, you spend the rest of your life talkin' to vegetables.
This is Clonadine Chlorpromazine.
Cocamine?
They don't even make this anymore.
Two of these, Mother Theresa becomes a maniac.
These, uh, I don't even know what this is.
I've never seen anything like this, not even on the streets!
And this?
And this?
This is THC.
Tetrohydrocannabinol.
Know what this is?
It's liquified, condensed marijuana.
Totally synthesized.
100 cc's of this, everybody in Detroit gets wasted!
No!
Hey Carmen!
Who's gonna clean all this shit up?
Dr. Carmen, what are you doing here?
I thought Berrisford-
He did!
Hettie, where's Cynthia?
-Isolation!
-I know that!
But where, which one?
In the B wing!
What's gotten into you?
Berrisford!
He's killed 'em!
Call Wasserman!
These damn doctors are crazier than the patients.
Give me the police.
Stat!
-Cynthia, please.
Let me see her.
-You're not supposed to be here!
Get out of my way!
Where is she?
[ALARM BUZZING]
Cynthia!
Get outta here.
I'm waiting for Harris.
-There is no Harris.
-You don't understand.
I do understand.
Cynthia, I can't come back, and I need you to understand something.
Can you do that, please?
To prove a theory, Berrisford secretly changed the medication for everybody in the group.
These drugs are what drove everybody to suicide.
It's not Unity Fields.
it's not Harris!
It's not you.
Do you understand?
Berrisford's responsible and he's gonna be treating you!
He wants to control you, just like Harris!
He can't prove his theory unless you want to kill yourself!
Do you understand?
He wants you to kill yourself!
You're wrong.
He comes to me.
He speaks to me.
There he is now.
Jesus, Cynthia, fight the drugs.
Fight the drugs he gave you!
[GRuNTING]
Did you kill him?
-No, no.
-Oh.
Then he won't be coming with us?
Oh, no.
Not where we're going, lovechild.
Here, take my hand.
Come on.
Oh, shit!
[ALARM RINGING] [cLAlvloRING1
Cynthia?
Cynthia?
Cynthia!
Dr. Carmen!
Where's Dr. Carmen?
-Do you see them, Cynthia?
-Yes.
Yes, I see them.
What do you want to do, Cynthia?
What do you want to do?
[ALARM RINGING]
No!
-Cynthia.
-it's your decision, Cynthia.
It's your choice.
Cynthia.
Choose, Cynthia.
Decide.
Act!
It's so beautiful.
No!
HARRIS:
You mustn't be afraid.
Come to me now.
You're mine forever, lovechild.
Unity.
One spirit.
One will.
It's time, Cynthia.
Now.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Cynthia!
Open your eyes!
Cynthia.
Cynthia!
Open your eyes.
Cynthia.
Cynthia, wake up.
Cynthia, wake up!
You've gotta help me now!
Pull yourself up!
Help me!
All that matters is our love at Unity.
No.
-There's nothing for me here.
-I'm here for you, you stay for me!
-Come on and pull yourself up!
-Cynthia, what do you see?
-Eternal bliss!
-Eternal bliss.
Who's there, Cynthia?
Who's waiting for you?
Friends.
No!
Don't listen to him.
They didn't care about you.
They didn't love you.
I love you!
I'll go with you but I won't let you go!
Look at him.
Look at him!
It's Berrisford!
Come on, Cynthia.
Look at him.
Look!
Look at him!
Now help me.
I can't do it alone, you help me!
Pull yourself up!
Try!
That's it.
Come on.
Come on!
A little more.
Come on!
Alex, let her go.
She's made her choice.
You can't bring her back.
It's a futile, empty gesture.
-Fuck you.
-That's the wrong answer, Alex.
No!
[scREAlvllNG]
Alright, what the hell's going on up here?
Come on!
How in the hell did they get down there?
Lieutenant, I'm glad you're here.
Alex was caught red-handed.
I came to look for Cynthia, I found him trying to push her
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean he's been-
Yes!
Yes, he's the one, he orchestrated this, raised the medication, he to whom I passed on the torch.
He arranged the whole thing, he arranged the switched medicines, he used these people for experiments.
No!
No.
He's responsible.
He did this.
My hand.
He did everything.
-Jesus, he tried to kill us!
-Oh, Alex, Alex, Alex.
Don't do it!
Do it.
Wrong again, Alex.
No!
[CAR ALARM BLARING]
It's alright.
It's alright.
It was Berrisford.
There is no Harris.
There's nothing there!
There's nothing to be scared of.
Alright?
You don't have to be afraid.
You don't have to be afraid anymore.
Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi
J' Time has come today J'
J' Young hearts can go that wayJ'
You ok, Cynth?
I mean, if you don't want to do this,
You don't have to.
That's okay.
Right, Harris?
No, Victor.
I say to you all now...
To all of you...
That this will be the ultimate joining.
Of man...
And woman.
Parent...
And child.
Humanity...
And Godhead.
Cynthia.
Come.
There's no shame, no sin.
No guilt.
It's just the final break with the old world.
As night falls, a new day begins.
A day of unity.
You belong to us forever.
Come to me, my lovechild.
Come to eternal bliss.
Get it around the other side.
Just keep back please, thank you!
Stay back!
What have we got?
Twenty-four bodies, Inspector.
Maybe more.
Cause of fire?
Some kind of explosion.
Gas main, methane, it's too soon to tell.
We got a survivor, get a stretcher up here!
Sue Vaughn, with Channel 5.
Is there any l.D. on her?
What is her name?
One question, please!
Channel 5, Sue Vaughn.
Get outta here!
We have been told that Franklin Harris is among the dead.
We are Channel 5, live at the spot.
Hey.
Harris says something's gonna come down...
Something heavy.
Life and death are simply different states of being.
You just cross into the next state.
Death is just this really beautiful trip.
It's a great thing.
I can't wait.
You're afraid, Cynthia.
He put his hand over a flame.
Unity.
He burns for our sins.
One spirit, one will.
I could kill you right now, couldn't I?
You could.
But I won't.
Scared of Harris?
You can't escape.
Harris loves you, brother.
If I kill you, it's because I love you.
Come to me, Cynthia.
Now.
Now.
Now.
Now.
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
You know I'll find you.
Cynthia.
How long has she been in this coma?
Thirteen years, five months, nine days.
Is that like, a, uh, world record for a coma or something?
No, apparently the longest on record is thirty-seven years.
Does she remember anything about the fire at Unity Fields?
No, she appears to have no memory of the accident itself or of the days leading up to it.
That is not uncommon after serious trauma.
But what happens to her now?
Have they notified her family or friends?
We stopped looking for family years ago.
What kind of doctor did you say you were?
I'm a psychiatrist.
What's a psychiatrist?
Well, a psychiatrist is, uh...
Psyche, from the Greek, means mind, and chiatre is to heal.
So, uh, psychiatrist is "mind healer."
Anyway, that's the idea.
You've been out of touch for so long that, uh...
It's more than your muscle tone that needs exercise.
Anyway, I have an assistant named Dr. Carmen, and he has a group therapy session that meets every day.
I've enrolled you in it starting tomorrow.
Well, I guess we can get started.
Hello, Cynthia.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
I'm
- People, please?
So I'm Dr. Carmen, and I'd like to welcome you to our little group.
I don't know how much Dr. Berrisford has told you about my methods;
I have my detractors.
I have my successes too, Cynthia.
There was a hummingbird that was just sitting out by the little flower and-
There's a lot of love in this room.
We're gonna get you out of your neurosis.
We're gonna get you out of your depression.
We're gonna get you out of that mint green thing you're wearing and into a flimsy negligee.
We're gonna pour water on the front.
Cynthia, I see us on a desert isle.
You, me, a portable water bed, it's beautiful.
Are you there?
Are you there with me?
It's beautiful.
There's the sun, there's the island, there's the water bed.
Ralph.
Cut the shit.
Get out of my chair.
I was on the verge here of a major breakthrough and you just blew it.
Ralph, the only thing you were on the verge of was bad taste.
Sit down.
Cynthia, I'm Dr. Carmen.
And I doubt if my welcome can equal
Ralph's, but I'll try.
This is the borderline personality group.
Welcome.
What is a borderline personality?
A borderline personality is when, it, um...
Well, borders on two very overused categories:
Psychotic, and neurotic.
- He's making this up.
- Go back to where you came from.
Go back to your nether-world.
He has touched you.
He will take you.
Thank you, Gilda.
As a personality syndrome, we've been exploring it for the past couple of years.
It includes identity crisis, um...
Chemical addiction, emotionalism, neuroses.
You forgot something.
Violent mood swings!
We're only violent when it's absolutely necessary.
If we're just about finished, I think we-
But we're not finished, Dr. Carmen, and they will not be finished until they make her feel as miserable and pathetic and confused as they are.
I am confused.
You see?
I hope you're all very happy.
- Honey, honey, please-
- Abe, not here, please!
I thought we decided no touching in front of other people.
You decided that.
I didn't decide that.
You can't just do that to me when I need to touch you, you can't do it to me,
You can't, you can't, you can't!
Oops.
- The crazy crew.
- Crazy?
You said today's secret word.
There are no secrets here.
Excuse me, Dr. Carmen...
Um, I don't think I fit your description of a personality.
You don't belong here.
You're not one of us.
Didn't Dr. Berrisford explain why you're here?
He said that he thought that this would help me fit into the eighties.
You want to fit into the eighties, you're at least two divorces, a condo, and a yeast infection behind the times.
Why don't you just stick to the seventies and move to Cleveland?
If I can offer a more practical suggestion,
- Why don't you just talk?
- Talk?
About something close to you.
Why don't you just quit fucking beating around the bush and ask her?
Just ask her!
- Do you have to be so crude?
- Shut up.
Come on, Cynthia, dish out the dirt.
Tell us about the commune.
You know, the last gasp of the age of Aquarius.
Building a better future on what?
Chemistry?
Good vibrations?
Tie-dyeing your undies?
Don't talk to her.
She's a reporter.
She writes stories about Elvis zombies from outer space.
They were from Atlantis.
I had pictures.
Shut up.
Just tell us about the orgies, Cynthia.
- She was a child at the time.
- So?
I'm sorry, I do not have any stories like that.
But I will tell you what I do remember.
What we felt.
What we believed was that if people could become selfless enough, if they could free themselves from their egos,
They would experience a kind of togetherness.
A oneness.
A Unity.
That is where the name came from.
We had a dream about a perfect society based on love and trust.
We weren't trying to change the world, we were just trying to love each other as much as we could.
Bullshit.
No!
It's not bullshit!
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
It's not bullshit.
No!
It's not bullshit!
It's beautiful.
It's not bullshit.
Lana hasn't spoken to anyone for three weeks, and now love, peace, and Woodstock.
Am I missing something?
Yeah.
She's espousing a total belief system, Cynthia is.
Make a commitment, make a decision to love.
And you're healed.
You're made whole.
It's not a new idea, Alex
Get rid of the troublesome ego.
Pow!
Pow!
Pow!
Go, ego.
Run free.
I'm still not sure she belongs in the group.
You don't have to be sure, Alex.
You don't have to come to a decision.
You know, the important thing is that she recovers her memory.
Now she relates to you, she likes you for some reason.
I don't know why, but she does.
So let's just press on.
Alright?
Drop down to first gear, honey.
It's Miller Time.
What are these?
Vitamins?
Beauty secrets from the Orient.
Look what they've done for me.
- Ralph.
- Hello!
You in a cooperative mood, or do I have to tie you up again?
Promises, promises.
Open.
Next time it'll be lower.
She's crazy about me.
Hey, I've got a great idea.
Why don't you come up to my room?
And I'll catch you up to date?
I got a hi-fi VHS VCR, a CD, and MTV.
I don't think so.
You know what I do when it all gets to be too much?
I make a little hole, and it all escapes.
Well, there's the assistant Ayatollah.
See you later.
Can I buy you some lunch?
I've been watching the others.
They belong here.
I don't.
And I'm feeling stronger, I'm getting used to things,
Like VCS's and MCD's.
I want to leave.
Cynthia, we've been trying to locate your family for years, and we haven't come up with anything.
Where would you go?
I'd find some people, like at Unity.
Cynthia, there aren't any more places like that.
And the fire that injured you took everything with it.
They're all gone.
I know that.
Yes, you do.
And I know this is a lot to take, but it's a buried memory and it needs to be uncovered, and put in the proper place in your mind.
Maybe it's something you could work on with the group.
Sooner or later, Cynthia, we all have to move on.
The sooner you do, the better.
Let's catch this.
Would somebody hit eight, please?
It stopped!
Great.
I think this is the fourth time this week.
Come on, why can't you fix this thing?
Come on, open it up!
Excuse me.
Unity's coming here.
- Cynthia!
- Now and forever.
Come to us, Cynthia.
We love you.
You belong to us.
Forever.
Come to us, Cynthia.
We love you.
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Excuse me.
Coming through!
Cynthia!
He's in there.
He's in there.
He's in there.
He's in there.
Cynthia, what happened?
- He's alive.
He's in there.
- Who's in there?
He's in there.
He's alive.
He's in there.
Well, first off, we're gonna feel a little silly, and we're gonna look
- a little silly.
- I don't think it's silly.
I think it's really neat.
I'm glad.
But let's see if this technique can help release a little hidden aggression.
Alright, who's gonna go first?
- Lana?
- Hmm.
Um.
I was wondering how many helpless and defenseless geese had to die to fill up these pillows.
They're polyester, honey.
Alright, well let's do the first one all together.
All right?
Ready?
One, two, three!
Outstanding.
Truly outstanding.
Alright, what are we feeling?
Gilda?
His power is transcendent.
The day of reckoning is at hand.
That's so weird.
That's exactly what I was feeling.
Ralph.
Miriam?
I was thinking about my first husband.
Or maybe the third.
What's the difference?
About four inches.
Cynthia?
I know it's hard.
Try to participate.
Alright.
Let's try this one again, only let's really let loose.
Miriam?
Ready?
One, two, three!
Our love will never die.
You fail me, Cynthia.
You failed us all.
All of us make the same journey.
But you made us wait all this time while you slept.
The waiting time is over, my love child.
Come to us.
We were happy.
And we were going to make our break with the world.
'Cause...
'Cause it didn't like us, and, um...
Their
- Their faces, and there was, uh...
Gasoline.
He put gasoline on us.
And, um...
Somehow I knew it was wrong, and I ran, and...
There was this big wind that picked me up and threw me.
And then, I don't know, um...
When I opened my eyes, I was here.
Why wasn't any evidence found?
Jerry cans would have been burned up completely before anything else.
We knew there was an explosion.
We just didn't know how or why.
Well, Lieutenant.
You must be pleased to close the case after thirteen years.
Who said it was closed?
What do you mean by that?
Well, Sleeping Beauty here woke up.
She didn't remember anything about the thirty deaths.
So now she remembers.
It was a goddamn Jonestown.
A suicide pact.
Who knows what she'll remember tomorrow?
If she ran for her life like she says or that she though the whole thing was a nifty idea.
Hell...
Maybe she bought the damn gasoline and helped pour it on the babies.
- That's enough.
- That's out of line.
Please, if you don't mind.
Please.
That man's a candidate for shock therapy.
A jumper cable right up his ass.
No, he's right.
They expected me to keep my promise at Unity Fields.
And they still do.
Man, there's nothing like a hot shower, huh?
Mm.
Um, Cynthia.
Oh.
Are you alright?
- I thought that after today, that, um-
- I'm fine.
You know what?
There's a hole where my heart's supposed to be.
It's like it hurts here, because I'm empty.
Um, you know, what you were saying about togetherness and everything makes perfect
$9086 llo me.
Mm, you know, maybe there's a little hope for me, sort of.
I think you want to help people.
Not, um, not like some others.
Um, if you need a friend here...
All of my friends are dead.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, if you need, um, a friend, a new
- A new friend, um-
Please.
Will you just leave me alone?
- Um.
- Please.
Leave me alone.
Lana, wait a second.
She didn't mean it!
Shit.
Look.
Look!
Lana may be a little weird, even for this place, but she means well.
I probably pull her chain too much, but she's reaching out.
We all are.
You should try to help her.
I can't help myself.
Cynthia.
Unity.
Unity.
Cynthia.
- Unity.
- Join us.
Come here, my child.
Cynthia, you're now part of the whole.
Embrace the unity of spirit before you.
Heart of the mind, soul of the self.
Spirit of the body.
Cleanse.
Cleanse.
Cleanse.
Cleanse.
Cleanse!
I warned you, Cynthia.
I warned you someone else would take your place.
Bob!
We got a girl drowned in the pool.
Get her legs.
Get her legs up.
Come on.
She's got no breath.
- God!
- How long was she under?
Did you see the police this morning?
They're all over the pool.
Fingerprints.
Photographs.
Yeah, next they're gonna have the fucking Coast Guard out here.
Lot of good that's gonna do Lana.
Ralph!
We are gonna start billing you for those outbursts.
Yeah, you bill us and our family for every goddamn aspirin!
You bill Lana for a body bag?
Dr. Freeman to gynecology.
Dr. Freeman to gynecology.
[WHISPERINGJ
You are defenseless against him.
Shithead.
Jesus.
You can't blame yourself about Lana.
She was unhappy.
And sometimes unhappy people do stupid things.
She didn't kill herself.
Harris did it.
Harris?
From Unity Fields.
You don't believe me, do you?
I believe that you believe it.
But I also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie-jeebies isn't gonna do shit to solve your real problems.
No.
No.
We gotta get you out of here.
Get you to someplace nice.
Like at the beach, or in the mountains, where you can fight your demons in your own way, right?
I don't know anybody.
I don't have any money.
You know me.
Listen, I was on the staff of a national publication, and some people called it a rag but it was home to me.
Me Magazine, you've heard of it!
- I was in a coma.
- Oh, right.
Well, when they carried me off to this funny farm, Saul
- He's the editor
- He told me "You're welcome back any time,"
so maybe this is the time.
Look, look.
I could go to him.
I could tell him your story.
He would give me a huge advance.
I'd share it with you, we'd be set!
- I don't know.
- No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait.
Let me be honest with you, okay?
This is a good story.
It's a great story, and it could mean a second chance for me, so ok!
Ok!
There is a little bit of self interest here, alright?
But look!
I really think you should tell people about Unity Fields.
How they take decent ideas and dreams, and turn them into something sick and poisonous.
You owe it to the world.
You owe it to yourself, now you have to ask yourself.
This is my life.
Do I want to live, or do I want to die?
- I want to live.
- Okay!
We're in business.
I think I know a way to make a phone call.
We'll get you out of here tonight.
Cynthia, this is the right thing to do.
Of course it is.
You said so.
- Yes.
I did.
- Yes.
Dr. Hillman, please call your office.
Uh-oh.
Get out your hall pass.
Ladies.
Nice to see you socializing, Cynthia.
Yes.
I'll see you later.
Thank you.
No.
Thank you.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.
Good.
No!
Miriam!
Miriam!
Stop!
Miriam.
He wants us all with him.
He wants us with him and whether we like it or not we're going.
Cynthia, we're all upset about what happened.
Harris promised us eternal bliss on the other side when we got there.
- Eternal bliss.
- Eternal bullshit.
Miriam was gonna write a story about me.
He killed her because she was gonna help me get out of here.
First off, Miriam was here because of an attempted suicide.
Several attempts, and Harris hasn't got anything to do with it.
You're not listening to me.
You are all gonna die.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
If I die, does my mom get a refund?
- Morning, Dr. B.
- Morning.
- Hey, here he is.
- Dr. Berrisford!
Dr. Berrisford, how are these suicides related?
- Was it a double suicide?
- No, no, no.
- These were tragic coincidences.
- But why did they kill themselves?
In borderline personality disorders there is a predisposition to suicidal tendencies.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
- What about the commune girl?
- Was it a mass suicide?
- Could she have killed them?
- Could it have been murder?
You're in pain, Cynthia.
Your pain is my pain.
We share it all.
Because we have our love.
And our love will never die.
- What are you doing here?
- Well, you know me at feeding time.
Don't make me take another friend.
Keep your promise, lovechild.
Join us.
No!
I didn't want you to be alone.
Looks like I was right.
We're so pathetic, rutting like rabbits.
I'm only doing it because in the morning
I can enjoy hating myself.
I'm only too glad to help.
They'll be doing a bed check soon.
I know a better place.
I know I've said this before, but I'm gonna say it again, and I'm gonna keep saying it until you believe it.
You're not responsible for what happened to Lana and Miriam.
And until you believe it, there's nothing I can do for you.
I'm lost, and confused, and concerned, and not just as a doctor.
What am I supposed to do, write you a prescription?
Oh, no!
You can't run away from this, Cynthia.
It's a filthy habit, Ed.
Disgusting.
What now?
- Looks like they went out again.
- Ok, excitement's over.
Why is it so difficult to keep the lights on around here?
Oh-h-h-h.
Mrs. Robertson, what are you doing up?
Here, put your hand up against the wall.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
It's just fine.
It's just overloaded circuits.
Please, everyone!
Go back to your rooms.
Upstairs?
Alright, alright.
There's something stuck in the turbine, I'll have it straight in just a minute.
Well, hurry.
It's just the lights went out.
Take a deep breath.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Connie?
Fuck.
Cynthia.
- We 're up here, Cynthia.
- Join us.
We love you.
What the hell?
We 're up here.
Keep following us.
We love you.
Cynthia.
Join us.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Where are Connie and Ed?
- Cynthia?
- Where are Connie and Ed?
They're with us now.
Where are Connie and Ed?
What the fuck is going on here?
!
We're not sure exactly.
We think they were drinking and they fell into the...
Main turbines.
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.
Is that supposed to be an explanation?
Huh, Dr. Dick?
Ed drank lots of times.
He did.
As a matter of fact, we used to share a bottle up on the terrace when you were at your
Save-the-Whale Meetings.
Oh, but he never wanted to jump in the goddamn Mixmaster, man.
There's something going on here.
Not something.
Someone.
Him.
Gilda, would you can it with your goddamn cosmic god shit?
- He has the power.
He calls us.
- I'm getting the fuck out of here.
Who're you?
Lieutenant Wasserman, assigned to you-
Yeah, yeah, shut up, I get the picture.
Try not to shoot me or your fat ass.
Ralph.
I have to leave.
Y'know, I thought you might need some company tonight.
It's safest here, really.
The police are here.
I'm here.
We're gonna have a nice, boring evening tonight.
I even brought provisions.
Pure, unadulterated junk food.
At this point, who cares about chemicals?
Right?
Have you tried these?
Ever tried those?
They don't serve these here
Hey, dick?
Try harder next time.
Connie and Ed aren't going to be the last.
Yes, they are.
Everyone's protected, nothing can happen.
- Everything ok?
- Yeah, Officer, it's fine, thank you.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I got on your case earlier.
- Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
- Hell, why not?
You want cream or sugar?
J' Regrets J'
J' I've had a few J'
J' But then again J'
J' Too few to whinge J'
J'ordoJ'
J' What I hope to do J'
J' I saw it through J'
- Ralph.
- Um, hi.
How are you?
- Nice night, huh?
- What is it?
I just wanted to let you know that everything's going to be ok.
It's going to be alright.
Ralph.
Cynthia?
Ralph?
Dr. Carmen, have you seen Ralph?
I was gonna ask you the same question, Hettie.
With all this commotion from the power outage, he didn't take his six o'clock tranq.
- Shit!
He misses two in a row, you-
- Dr. Carmen!
Where in the hell have you been?
Pesco, Ralph.
He's knocked out his bodyguard.
There's a trail of blood all the way down the hall.
He's got Cynthia!
This is Freddy!
We need backup, now.
And away we go!
I...
I think that we should go back upstairs
And we should talk to Doctor- Ah!
I'm sorry.
You're really making me nervous.
And I don't like it.
That was a little joke.
What are you laughing at?
Relax!
Come on!
Ralph, don't.
I don't think that we should go out there.
- I have to talk to you!
- I want to go back upstairs.
It's very important!
It's very, very important!
Very, very.
Very.
Very, very, very, very important!
It's very important that I talk to you!
Ralph, I don't think that you're being yourself.
Ha!
Not myself?
Not myself?
!
Who the fuck else am I supposed to be?
How are we gonna get out of here, Ralph?
Ralph.
I come down here a lot.
It helps me unwind.
Shit!
Fuck, this always worked before.
I've gotta calm down.
I gotta calm down.
I gotta calm down!
I gotta calm down!
They're in the sub-basement.
We have to take the stairs.
- Ralph's killed the elevator.
- Let's hope he stops there.
What did I want to talk to you about?
Oh right, right, right!
There are only a few chances in life for real glory, and most people fuck it off!
Most people- Most people can't even find their own noses on their fat faces!
You want an example?
Alright, how about every fucking doctor, every fucking patient in this entire fucking hospital?
Ralph?
Wouldn't you like to speak with a doctor?
I think you know what I'm talking about, Cynthia.
No, I don't, I don't.
You don't!
Fuckin' the great big gig in the sky, don't play dumb!
I think you know the word I'm searching for, Cynthia.
- Cynthia...
- U-N-I-T-Y.
- Cynthia...
- Unity.
Join us, Cynthia!
In Unity.
In beautiful Unity.
- In Unity.
In the real world.
Join us.
- Cynthia...
You belong to us.
Forever.
Join us.
- Hey!
- You alright?
- Drop those knives.
- Knives?
Knives?
These are not knives, these are fine surgical instruments.
- Don't make me hurt you.
- No!
You're right.
This is madness.
Later.
You alright?
Okay, doctor.
My office, now?
Alex.
Alex, help me.
- What could I do?
- Help me, Alex.
What is it that you're implying, Lieutenant?
Fucking crazy people.
Who knows what they can do?
Do you imagine that she drowned Lana without getting wet?
You saw Ralph kill himself.
She was there every single time.
She's some kind of goddamn catalyst.
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out one way or another.
- Police custody is long overdue.
- Police custody.
You didn't think I belonged in the group from the beginning, did you?
- No, I didn't.
- Don't be hard on yourself, ok?
What?
I needed the group.
I needed to find out where I belonged.
I know.
It's with him.
Cynthia, I need you to come with me now, alright?
Nurse?
Let's go.
- Where are you taking her?
- Isolation.
Isolation?
The girl needs human contact, connection.
Isolation's the worst place in the world for her.
Well, the alternative is police custody.
No, the alternative is a court order.
There's not a judge in the-
You want this.
You want her on the edge.
You've wanted it since the beginning!
Alex, I know you're fond of this girl but you are out of line.
You want to see your theory played out.
Shh.
Alex.
Goodbye.
Thanks for trying, but it's time for me to go now.
Okay, honey.
Now you just relax.
We're just gonna take you someplace.
Did you hear that?
You're killing her with your theories.
Alex, this has nothing to do with theories.
Look at her.
Can't you understand and see she's estranged from herself?
Wouldn't matter if she was in the Mojave
Desert or the middle of New York City.
She's without will.
There's plenty of room for yours, right?
Now this has got to stop.
I'll release her into police custody if I can stay on as her physician.
It's alright with me.
Alex, your tenure with the clinic is over.
You can't do that!
You want to walk on your own?
Follow me.
- Would you like to come in?
- No, thank you.
I'm sorry.
I understand where I am.
What are you saying?
No.
No.
But why?
- Why me?
- Because you are special, lovechild.
Don't you remember why?
- No.
- It will come to you in time.
Meanwhile, I will come to you.
Everything all right in here, honey?
Yes.
It's going to be beautiful.
Very soon.
I am not for this world.
But you are.
You can be.
Defy the other world.
Look to your heart.
Hey!
Better release some hidden aggression.
Feel better?
No?
Yes?
Maybe?
Officer, I'll write myself a prescription in the morning.
I knew you'd come.
But you're too late.
I warned her.
I told her what she had to do.
You won't get to her.
You won't get me.
You don't like the way I drive, Doctor Addictive Buttface?
Then stay out of the parking lot!
Touchdown!
Oh.
I'm exerting my will, Doctor.
- Are you ready for Unity?
- I'm so tired.
Can't you just kill me?
No, my lovechild.
You must do it yourself.
- Carmen.
You look like shit.
- Yes, listen.
I need, um...
The scripts for the therapy group.
Forget about it, man.
I can't do that.
That's Berrisford's show.
He'd kill me if I did that.
- This is it, isn't it?
- It's the second drawer in the back.
Hey, have you seen that new nurse in Psychiatric?
She's unbelievable, man.
I'm telling you, I'm thinking about having myself committed.
Just so I can get close to her.
She's got the most unbelievable legs.
No, this- this is the standard stuff.
Of course it's the standard stuff.
What'd you expect, nuclear secrets?
You fill these prescriptions?
No, Berrisford does it himself every day.
Comes in in the morning, sets up the medication for the day and Hettie takes it when she needs it.
Yeah, well I need it now.
What the fuck are you doin', man?
What're you doing?
You out of your mind?
- Have you lost your mind completely?
- Read this.
Pesco, Ralph.
Pesco is dead!
- Just help me read it!
What is it?
- Alright, just calm down!
Lithium, four times a day.
- Is this Lithium?
- No.
No, this is Berynthine.
This is the exact opposite of Lithium.
You give this to a normal person, he'd flip out.
Someone like Pesco, you can forget about it.
Listen, what is this, and this, and this?
Just move.
I'll tell you everything, alright?
Ok, these are dextroamphetamines.
You take one of these, you walk on the ceiling.
This is methylphenidate.
You take this, you spend the rest of your life talkin' to vegetables.
This is Clonadine Chlorpromazine.
Cocamine?
They don't even make this anymore.
Two of these, Mother Theresa becomes a maniac.
These, uh, I don't even know what this is.
I've never seen anything like this, not even on the streets!
And this?
And this?
This is THC.
Tetrohydrocannabinol.
Know what this is?
It's liquified, condensed marijuana.
Totally synthesized.
100 cc's of this, everybody in Detroit gets wasted!
No!
Hey Carmen!
Who's gonna clean all this shit up?
Dr. Carmen, what are you doing here?
I thought Berrisford-
He did!
Hettie, where's Cynthia?
- Isolation!
- I know that!
But where, which one?
In the B wing!
What's gotten into you?
Berrisford!
He's killed 'em!
Call Wasserman!
These damn doctors are crazier than the patients.
Give me the police.
Stat!
- Cynthia, please.
Let me see her.
- You're not supposed to be here!
Get out of my way!
Where is she?
Cynthia!
Get outta here.
I'm waiting for Harris.
- There is no Harris.
- You don't understand.
I do understand.
Cynthia, I can't come back, and I need you to understand something.
Can you do that, please?
To prove a theory, Berrisford secretly changed the medication for everybody in the group.
These drugs are what drove everybody to suicide.
It's not Unity Fields.
It's not Harris!
It's not you.
Do you understand?
Berrisford's responsible and he's gonna be treating you!
He wants to control you, just like Harris!
He can't prove his theory unless you want to kill yourself!
Do you understand?
He wants you to kill yourself!
You're wrong.
He comes to me.
He speaks to me.
There he is now.
Jesus, Cynthia, fight the drugs.
Fight the drugs he gave you!
Did you kill him?
- No, no.
- Oh.
Then he won't be coming with us?
Oh, no.
Not where we're going, lovechild.
Here, take my hand.
Come on.
Oh, shit!
[CLAlvloRING1
Cynthia?
Cynthia?
Cynthia!
Dr. Carmen!
Where's Dr. Carmen?
- Do you see them, Cynthia?
- Yes.
Yes, I see them.
What do you want to do, Cynthia?
What do you want to do?
No!
- Cynthia.
- It's your decision, Cynthia.
It's your choice.
Cynthia.
Choose, Cynthia.
Decide.
Act!
It's so beautiful.
No!
You mustn't be afraid.
Come to me now.
You're mine forever, lovechild.
Unity.
One spirit.
One will.
It's time, Cynthia.
Now.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Cynthia!
Open your eyes!
Cynthia.
Cynthia!
Open your eyes.
Cynthia.
Cynthia, wake up.
Cynthia, wake up!
You've gotta help me now!
Pull yourself up!
Help me!
All that matters is our love at Unity.
No.
- There's nothing for me here.
- I'm here for you, you stay for me!
- Come on and pull yourself up!
- Cynthia, what do you see?
- Eternal bliss!
- Eternal bliss.
Who's there, Cynthia?
Who's waiting for you?
Friends.
No!
Don't listen to him.
They didn't care about you.
They didn't love you.
I love you!
I'll go with you but I won't let you go!
Look at him.
Look at him!
It's Berrisford!
Come on, Cynthia.
Look at him.
Look!
Look at him!
Now help me.
I can't do it alone, you help me!
Pull yourself up!
Try!
That's it.
Come on.
Come on!
A little more.
Come on!
Alex, let her go.
She's made her choice.
You can't bring her back.
It's a futile, empty gesture.
- Fuck you.
- That's the wrong answer, Alex.
No!
Alright, what the hell's going on up here?
Come on!
How in the hell did they get down there?
Lieutenant, I'm glad you're here.
Alex was caught red-handed.
I came to look for Cynthia, I found him trying to push her
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean he's been-
Yes!
Yes, he's the one, he orchestrated this, raised the medication, he to whom I passed on the torch.
He arranged the whole thing, he arranged the switched medicines, he used these people for experiments.
No!
No.
He's responsible.
He did this.
My hand.
He did everything.
- Jesus, he tried to kill us!
- Oh, Alex, Alex, Alex.
Don't do it!
Do it.
Wrong again, Alex.
No!
It's alright.
It's alright.
It was Berrisford.
There is no Harris.
There's nothing there!
There's nothing to be scared of.
Alright?
You don't have to be afraid.
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

There isn't any... big brother around!
But you still have to join groups
Don't say I don't watch... for your new comers

Fatty... and the coach are together
Every time we fight with her, we'll get punished!
Besides, she has a lot of cigarettes!
So the girls just go to her group!
Shit, why don't you study more to make the long story short!
They have... the real power!
Lynn, what happened to your knee?
Someone pushed me during PE class
Eat it, how dare you
It wasn't my fault
Are you going to eat it?
It wasn't her, I was the one
So it was you?
I'm not being unreasonable!
Rosy, spit in it!
What, spit!
Lynn, are you for real?
Who's joking with you?
Now, I don't owe you anything!
Your turn!
Eat it
Why should I eat your spit?
What did you say?
The most I can do is apologize!
You only going to say goodbye!
Then I wound my knee back.
So much bull, you won't know if I don't hit you!
Wait, no wonder you can't be the boss
We have to be reasonable!
She already promised to wound herself then we can't make her eat my spit

That is this?
I don't... like use it
Everyone!
Let me introduce, this is Mendy!
Thank you!
She's from the mainland
Lynn, you're really going to fight with Fatty?
Last time I was the Big sister
It's only fair!
She's not doing a good job!
So mean and cruel, how can she be a big sister!
That's true!
Lynn, superintendent is tough, don't mess around!
Are you afraid?
I'm not!
That's good then!
Meeting is over, let's go to bed!
Do you have private bat?

Just like a pig, wonder what she's talking?
I don't know!
Lynn is a trouble maker, watch her!
Don't worry, coach!
She can't do anything wrong when I'm here!
If she becomes... big sister again you'll have trouble too!
Fatty, I know Lynn is over there
Let's go!
Are you Lynn?
Yes, what's the matter?
I just want you and the girls to join me!
Good, who's the big sister?
It's me, of course!
How, you're not as senior as me!
And your background is not as good
Fuck you!
Bend down!
Bed down, I won't hit you!
6180, did you see them fighting out there?
Yes, but she hit her first
Then they are fighting?
Not fighting, she was hit!
Did she hit her back?
If you were hit by so many... won't you fight back?
6180,
I just want to know if she fought back?
Yes
Why you gave me so much shit?
I was hit by her, is that fighting?
6180, you can go now!
Thank you, madam!
Suppose you should grand one more month... in prison
From now on you have to behave or else I won't be as lose, go out!
Thank you for helping me!
I was just telling the truth
Fatty, don't start anything from now on
Yes I know
Now I hold you one month salary, go out!
Thank you, madam!
What are you two doing, watch them closely!
If my head knows about the fight, I have trouble
Thank you, madam!

Say it one more time!
What are you doing?
Fatty, don't you know I'm on duty?
Yes
Don't start anything, hurry up and go to bed!
Kelly, good thing you didn't marry Wayne!
He's only a manager in a small company!
I thought he was the owner!
Kelly, are you listening?
Yes, keep talking!
Lately he kept begging... to see you!
But he's full of lies, not worth to see!
You didn't talk like that when he bought you things
Babe, you're still on his side?
I knew he was just a manager
You kept thinking he's an owner!
Why didn't you tell me earlier
Then you wouldn't let me go out with him
Babe, are things tough in here?
!
No!
How is he?
!
I heard he's been drunk a lot lately!
And got fired!
Do you want to see him?
I don't want to see anyone!
Mom, please don't come anymore!
Kelly, are you mad at me?
6180, go with us to body searching
Why?
You just had a visitor, and you look suspicious!
What did I hide?
We don't have to search you if we know, stupid!
Are you coming or not?
If you don't... come with us now
The superintendent will punish you...
Take off your clothes, hurry!
Also take off your bra and underwear!
Put your legs apart, squat down
Rabbit jump
Stop
Don't have to be serious, we're not wearing it!
You should see like me!
None of my business whether it's good or bad
Lynn, look
Let me do it
Madam, it's all done
So soon?
Only ten pieces a day
I have to be fast,
I want to wash your bottle
Hurry up!
Ok!
I like to go to restroom!
Me too!
I am a good leader,

Even it's not much, but it's better than nothing!
The tea tastes good?
950, come out!
Coming
Clean it up after finishing it!
Put this one on!
You want me to be the model?
I have a good figure!
Topless or bare back or latest from Paris?
There is no man to look at you!
But women can have a good look!
They can look at themselves
It's the trenol... to be sexy!
I join in!
Good morning, madam!
Morning!
Superintendent is here, any complaints?
Good boy
You should inform the officer before making a complaint
Madam just told me so,
I didn't know!
Do you know the rules here?
You have to go through the procedures!
I didn't know the rules
What have you got to complain?
I am disturbed all the time!
By who?
By her!

But even if I prove for you

Kelly, who wants to be a slave?
I just want Rocky to live better
You can see that
We are pressed by them... all the time!
If I'll be your witness
You think that they will beat you up?
I see staying here as paying my debt!
I am ready to be tortured beaten!
My son is innocent!

Rocky was born here
But to stay in jail with me!
Tell you what else I can do?

You want to trap one another!
Why can you... live in harmony
We Indians... are better!
958, take Rocky out!
I only want to ask you something!
You can ask me... whatever you want
I know you don't gamble!
Why did you go to gamble in Macau?
You really want to know?
Just think that it's an excuse for me!
Tell me!
Do you know... how much your mum asked?
I could never have that much money
Why didn't you tell me?
You know your mum better!
She thought that...
I had a rich father
Kelly, I don't want to lose you!
So you went over to Macau?
I only wanted to make win, but I'm lose!
Life is not easy!
Kelly!
It's my fault... to put you into this situation!
Don't cry, you are a man!
Kelly, forgive me, let's start all over again
Mum said you got laid off!
I'll look for a job straight away!
Look at you, who will hire you
I will clean myself up!
Kelly, I will save up when you come out!
Not just me

The one out weights... the other wins
My pals, come sit over there

I have to stay at my godmother's place
Rocky, come
Come on?
I am not going
Listen to mum, be good!
I want God-mother!
Don't cry!
You bitch, you can never have dignity!
Rocky should not have a mum like you!
I'm sorry, Lynn!
Go... don't come back!
Fatty, just because...
You have the coach's support!
Come fight with me one to one!
If you beat me, you are the boss!
Fine, whenever you like!
Madam!
What are you doing?
The coach said Lynn wanted to beat you?
Yes, madam, ask Jean, she'll tell the truth!
Is it true, Jean?
Did you hear that?
Tell the superintendent!
I am not asking you to cry here!
958, I am always good to your son!
Be co... operative!
I will madam!
Tell me what I like to hear!
Lynn, don't go in, it's dangerous!
You coward, I don't know you!
No, Lynn, no!
Get loss!
Why are you so late, Lynn?
Fatty, come on!
Great!
Don't fight!
Lynn, come out, Lynn!
Jean, what are you doing?
Take her away!
No!
Get loss, or I will beat you too!
Go in!
On your knees, all of you!
Bitch, did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
My mum is not with me in jail
You are a good fighter, right!
Take her to the hospital
6180, stay here!
Why did you... hit me only?
The coach said... she couldn't stop you!
She wants to build her... own influence here!
What did you say?
Kill me if you dare!
Stop, or I get you the injection!
I am not scared!
I will complain to the J. P!
Grab her aside!
Let me go, you bitch!
Madam, a J.P. Is coming in the afternoon!
Give her the injection and make her write that... she hurt herself!
Help,
I want no injection!
How can you do so?
Shut up, you don't have the right to say!
Kelly, help me!
Lynn... you think... you can hide away the facts?
Complain for me!
Where can...
Good morning, sir!
How are you?
She's the superintendent here!
How are you?
6180, get change come with me
To where?
Is it a hard job?
No sir
It's not easy to be acting superintendent!
No sir!
Is there any trouble?
No sir!
Work hard, the boss considers to promote you!
You don't have to be acting anymore!
Thank you, sir
Be impartial, the people will obey you!
Yes sir!
Line up, J.P. Is coming!
Any complaints?
J.P. Is coming!
Is it hard work in here?
I have only been here lately
Fatty, doesn't know... the J.P. Has gone!
It's not my idea!
You bitch, I thought you were a good one!
Where are you going?
Kid, what's your name?
How did she get hurt?
Because of work, the doctor put her to sleep!
Good-bye!
6180, stop!
Stop, I want to complain!
Miss Choy, do you know what are you doing?
Sorry, madam!
Did she come here by herself?
I want to complain!
Sorry, madam!
I want you to report that
Madam, what's the
Loitering!
You told me... to do so!
Report her or you get reported
Madam, may I ask, what's our rules?
What are you say?
I'm not betrayed
Our rules are... justice and serious!
I quit... if you frame her up!
Pick it up!
I tell you, you're a useless acting superintendent
You never have your own decision, but listen to her!
Stay where you are!
I wouldn't care less!
Be careful
Let me help you
What are you doing?
Sticky nose, go back!
Can't I help her to eat?
Of course not, go back to your bed!
Did you hear me?
Go back to your bed!
Did you hear that, go back to your bed
Go!
You are in jail, don't forget
Madam, don't have to be angry with them!
You look so beautiful, the pimples are gone!
You must have a steady boyfriend!
Mind your own business
Don't get upset
Otherwise you'll get... the pimples on your face!
Of course I don't want to
Lynn just wouldn't sign the statement and the acting superintendent... wants her down!
I won't be upset if Lynn knows what to do!
Madam, it's pretty touchy
She makes... a mess in here!
What can we do?
Right, what's your idea to solve the problem?
Leave it to me to fix her up
How?
I help her to toilet, and chuck the rice away!
That solves the problem, right?
Don't tell me nothing, I know nothing
OK!
Kelly, put the stod there!
We help her to sit there, be careful
Take it easy, slowly!
Sit properly!
Kelly, guard the door!
Sit properly!
Sit properly, I feed you!
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth... wider!
Chew it...
like me!
Right, swallow it, come on!
Have one more,
I give you some more
Good girl, does it hurt?
Let me go.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let me go...
I tattoo the 'Q' on you, we are pals!
Sis, that's Hong Kong on the other side!
Yes, that's Hong Kong, the paradise!
Lynn, what's matter?
To the toilet
Put her down!
What did the superintendent tell you?
Did you hear me, put her down!
Put her down or I report you!
You can never beat me!
I count 1 to 5 or give me your card, 1, 2... 3, 4, 5, do what you like, you whore!
What did you call me?
Whore hear me?
6180, Miss Ko complains about you!
You have insulted disobeyed her, right?
Yes!
What have you got to say?
No
Do you want to say anything?
Yes!
Why?
Madam, we are sent here to serve the sentence!
The aim is to lose our freedom to correct ourselves, but we still have our dignity
You are in jail, no dignity
You think you have no dignity here?
She complained me... helping Lynn to the toilet and you prevent me from seeing the J.P.
Even the number of napkins are limited!
Also the quantity of tissue is limited
It's not jail here but hell!
What are you talking about?
Here is the worse place... on earth!
Put her try the isolated cell
Yes, madam!
"I don't want to know if it's tear or blood"
"Only sad song lasts"
"Open the lock in heart"
"It's time to end"
"I don't believe I'm an unfortunate man"
"One with a few flesh wounds..."
"is not worse than one without self"
"and food"
"Trust my own power"
"Burn up"
"I won't complain and regret"
"Uphold freedom"
"Trust my own power"
"Burn up"
"I won't regret"
You will be released in few months' time
I hope you have justified yourself and know what you have done wrong!
I have never done anything wrong!
You are very stubborn!
Be good, that's good for you!
I know what I am doing, thanks!
The baby is expected next month
We will arrange to send you...
I will sent you... to the garment section
You can go now!

Kelly...
Watch out for her belly
It's so big!
Such a big belly!
Does he kick you?
Kelly, I can't help you nothing but to help you... delivering the baby
Do you think it's a boy or girl?
They are the same, if Wayne behaves!
Kelly, you have thought it over?
Yes, the isolated cell made me to think!
Kelly
You had such a hard time... in the isolated cell
Lynn, don't say it any more1
It's because of my character
Right, how are you now?
I am alright
Look, from the space!
You have got so much now!
Lynn and I keep them for you
You are pregnant, should eat more!
Have some!
Rosy, you are not pregnant!
It's nice!
Can you do me a favor?
What?
!
Do help me!
I don't need them, I need tissues!
That's easy to do!
One napkin for four pieces... of tissues!
Lynn, should be eight pieces!
Right, one for eight pieces!
Give us a hand
One for eight pieces
Rocky, catch the ball
Be careful
Whore
I hit her!
Don't provoke her!
We can never beat her
I am not... afraid of her!
Rocky
Kelly, Fatty wants to see you!
Ask her to come to see me here!
Shut up, I am not talking to you
What?
I go with you
Kelly, you can't go!
I have to settle it
I go... with you!
Kelly, don't go
Jean, we all stay here together
I have to settle it anyway
She's coming!
The world of freedom over there
Get up!
You are really gutsy!
I am sorry, I didn't mean what I had done
I don't care, do you know my nickname?
Scar face!
Say it again
Scar face, is that clear?
Someone tries to escape
Stop her!
Go in there, one by one!
Quick...
Quick... go in!
Kelly
Bitch, wanna kill her?
Mind your own business, sit down!
Kelly
Blood
You!
What?
Help her on the table!
Can't have child!
What are you looking at?
You are not a woman!
Bitch
Come back... where are you going?
Stop, come back...
Son of bitch!
Go to hell
Beating me, bitch!
You dare to hit me!
Damn it!
Shut up, sit down!
Rocky!
Stop, don't fight!
You dare to hit me!
I kill you!
Go away!
They have sent a lot of people!
You dare to hit me!
I report you!
Calm down, sit down!
Stop fighting... or we fire tear gas!
Help her to go there
Come here!
Don't fire, or I'll kill her
Bitch, try it if you don't believe 950, calm down, let's talk!
Damn you, no way!
We want to see the commissioner!
Yes, we want to see the commissioner!
We want to see the commissioner!
Lynn, Kelly's feeling real bad...
Kelly, are you alright?
Lynn, never open up the door!
We can't see... the commissioner!
Get me the first aid box!
950, open up and send her to the hospital
No more bull shit!
Calm down, get me the first aid box
Kelly, can you stand a bit longer?
Who can do it?
Bitch, ask the commissioner to come!
Jean, is Rocky alright?
958, take Rocky to the hospital
Lynn, let Jean take Rocky to the hospital
Jean, don't!
She's liar
Jean, you go with Rocky first!
You always use my son to thrones me!
To force me to do what I don't like
Are you happy?
Rocky, forgive mummy!
If you die, mummy will come with you
You hear that, ask the commissioner to come
Hold Rocky for me!
Kelly, don't worry!
I can help you... delivering the baby!
Harder, take a deep breath, push!
Baby's coming out, push
It's a boy!
Very nice!
The commissioner has come!
I am the commissioner, do you want to see me?
We want to complaint
I know, take it easy!
How are the casualties?
She's got a nerve break down!
We don't want to be turned up!
Right!
We can... be witnesses
Yes, we can be witnesses!
We wish that you can be impartial
How can you make such a mess!
Sorry sir!
I promise you... a better environment!
Get all those things away!
Be quiet!
Kelly, how do you feel?
Jean, send Rocky to the hospital
Rocky, he's awake!
Does it hurt?
Tell mummy you're alright!

We want to see her today
Don't use the soap for the last bath
It brings bad luck!
I don't want to see you... back in here!
One after one, follow me to see Kelly
You own me... one this time!
Madam, you deserve the promotion!
Thanks
Kelly...
Kelly, we come to say good-bye!
Kelly, it's a small gift from us!
Good luck for you!
It's not of good material, but keep it!
Thank you!
Kid, give me a kiss!
He's got a lot of god-mother!
So you are the boss now
That's nothing!
When will you be released?
Four more months, will you pick me up?
I miss you!
Bye!
Jean, bye!
Kelly, take care!
Congratulations, you can really face the world now
Yes, I can now!
Kelly, bye!
Madam, thanks
Don't mention it!
Bye!
Lynn, no more arguments!

(sighs)
Hey!
You're not even gonna ask what's wrong?
What's wrong, Ma?
I got three days to live.
Fine, Ma.
I'll scratch the Bengay off the grocery list.
I can't believe you're so insensitive.
Ma, you are not dying.
I am, Dorothy.
I had a dream last night, a death dream.
Your father spoke to me.
Spoke to you?
How?
Do I look like Rich Little?
Just listen.
I'm sitting in the living room, and the clock strikes 9:00.
Then the bell rings.
It's your father in his fedora.
He always wore a fedora on Saturday.
He walks towards me, reaches out his hand and says, "Sophia, you can come now.
There's room for you now."
That's it?
You want him to show up with Barbara Eden and the college all-American football team?
It's a dream, not a Bob Hope special.
I'm dying, Dorothy.
Saturday, 9:00.
Don't make any plans.
Ma, you're being ridiculous.
I know.
When was the last Saturday night you had plans?
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
Those look lovely.
So do you.
Oh, Blanche, you really got all dressed up for your brother.
Well, we do come from the South.
We always felt it was important to look absolutely great in front of company.
Hi, girls.
What time does Clayton get here?
Oh, any minute now.
Oh, we better put out the welcome mat.
We don't have a welcome mat.
What about the one Dorothy says is at the foot of your bed?
(doorbell)
Oh, there's Clayton now.
Remember what I said.
No remarks about his marriage breaking up.
He's still a little touchy.
Clayton!
Baby brother!
Sister!
Oh, my, look at you all gussied up.
Prettier than a spring-bloomin' peach tree on a dewy April morning.
Well, you oughtta talk, all fresh-scrubbed and rosy-cheeked like a country parson at a September hoedown.
Why do I get the feeling they had a maid named Honeybee when they grew up?
(door closes)
Come on in, Clayton.
I want you to meet my best friends Dorothy and Rose.
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.
Rose, so nice to see you.
How was your trip, Clayton?
Oh, fine.
It just went by in no time.
That usually means he met a stewardess he liked.
Blanche.
Lunch, dinner or drinks?
Dinner.
I'm beginning to see the family resemblance.
Honey, come on inside.
I'll get you all settled down.
Then I want to tell you all the wonderful things
I have planned for us to do.
OK.
It was so nice finally meeting you all.
See you later, Clayton.
Isn't it nice to see a brother and sister who are such good friends?
It certainly is.
Oh, I always wish that I could have been closer to my brother, Phil.
You know, go places together, share experiences.
Although I did love borrowing his clothes.
Did you like wearing boys' clothes growing up?
No, but fortunately neither did my brother Phil.
Ma, why are you sitting here in the dark?
Conserving electricity for those who will still be living past Saturday.
Oh, Ma...
Put out your hands, Dorothy.
What for?
So I can say hello like Magic Johnson.
So I'm gonna give you some of my personal things.
My bank book, some stocks...
Oh, Ma, come on, now.
This is crazy.
Hi, y'all.
Oh, fabulous.
Roy and Dale are back.
So, where are you two off to tonight?
Oh, that's a surprise.
Wait a minute.
Isn't that my silver locket in there?
Nice getting to know you, gomer.
See you around.
What's all this about a surprise?
Oh, well, I've done a little matchmaking.
Blanche, not again.
Yes, again.
Now, you are 45 years old.
You've been single almost two years.
Well, both Dorothy and I know how much fun the single life is.
Many's the night Dorothy has sat here alone in this room watching me go out on dates.
Sometimes I watch her go from the kitchen window.
It's easier to bay at the moon.
I just don't want you being afraid to get back on that horse and make a commitment again.
(doorbell)
Here's your horse pulling up now.
Hello, Lois.
Come in.
Clayton, remember Lois from the museum?
Of course.
So nice to see you again.
Oh, it's a pleasure.
You two can get reacquainted on the way.
These are your tickets for the concert in the park.
It starts in 15 minutes, so you better hurry up, now.
Bye.
Have a good time!
(Dorothy) Good night!
I was never any good at blind dating.
I always felt so awkward.
Oh, Dorothy, I have a surefire icebreaker
I can teach you right now.
Oh, once you learn this any man is putty in your hands.
Oh, Blanche, come on.
That is ridiculous.
I mean, I'm certainly not gonna waste my time listening to this adolescent nonsense.
Did you say putty?
Ha ha ha ha.
Sit back.
Now, just play like we're at the movies.
OK.
First I start to yawn a little.
Then I put my hands up over my head like this...
Oh, Blanche, I know that one.
You end up with your arm around me.
Yeah, but that's just the first part.
Did you know that if you blow right on the tip of a man's earlobe, it can drive him absolutely crazy?
I'll show you.
I'm gonna be dead in 24 hours.
Couldn't you stay in the closet for one more day?
Rose, what are you doing here?
Clayton.
It's my late night at the counseling center.
But what are you doing here?
Blanche told me she was sending you on a date.
Oh, she did.
Didn't it work out?
Well, let's just say Blanche has it in her head what type is right for me, and she's way off.
I'll bet I could sit here for a minute and tell you what your type is.
I'm good at this.
Gosh, I'm stuck.
You haven't even started.
No, I'm stuck on the gum somebody left on this bench.
OK, now, you just give me your honest reactions when people go by.
That's how I'll tell.
OK.
Here comes one.
Go.
No.
Too thin.
Here comes one.
Too short?
Next.
Oh, Clayton!
Clayton, you're not playing fair.
That's a man.
That's a man and you're a man.
You're both men.
(laughs nervously)
Clayton, you're that thing that everyone said Olga Larsen's nephew was 'cause he wore paisley clogs and gave out puff pastry on Halloween.
I've been called a lot of things in my time, but that's a first for that one.
Yeah, I'm gay, Rose.
But Blanche told us you were married.
I was.
After a while I just couldn't deny the truth to myself.
Seems silly still denying it to my big sister.
Well, have you tried telling her?
Every time I see her.
And I always chicken out.
Oh...
I know Blanche.
I mean, she'd be upset, but not for long.
And just think how it would help you two in the long run.
But how do I keep from chickening out?
By telling her.
Tonight, while you've still got your dander up.
I'm sorry.
Did I say something embarrassing?
No.
No, Rose.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I've got to tell her tonight.
But it's not gonna be easy.
I mean, I still haven't told Blanche
I was the one who stole the Montgomery Clift poster off her wall when she left for college.
(sirens and gunshots on TV)
Ma, what are you doing up?
Someone left the lock off my cage.
I couldn't sleep.
I was afraid I'd have that dream again.
What are you two doing up?
Well, I'm waiting up for Clayton.
I'm gonna make sure he had a good time tonight.
My brother and I are very close.
Oh, that's sweet, Blanche.
Evening, ladies.
Well, Clayton Hollingsworth, it's about time.
You and your date must have really hit it off.
Hey, Rose.
What are you doing with Clayton?
We ran into each other in the park.
What happened to Lois?
Oh, she went home.
We weren't really suited, Blanche.
Not suited?
Clayton, sometimes I do not understand you.
Time after time I fix you up with attractive, eligible women, and nothing happens.
It's time you found yourself a woman.
Now, what is the matter with you?
Tell her, Clayton.
I will, Rose.
Tell me what?
Well, I ran into Rose in the park, and...
And?
And we had a long talk, and...
And?
And... we slept together tonight.
Dorothy, all that stuff I said about preparing for a burial, forget it.
Oh, Ma.
You finally came to your senses.
Yes.
I decided to be cremated instead.
Oh, Ma.
Oh...
It's a great idea.
My ashes can be divided among you, your brother, Phil, and your sister, Gloria.
Nah, forget Gloria.
I don't want to spread myself too thin.
Hi, girls.
I need to talk.
Oh, honey, what is it?
All day long Blanche has been giving me looks.
I think she's really mad at me.
Look, Rose, what happened between you and Clayton last night is your business, not Blanche's.
That's just the point, Dorothy.
Nothing happened between Clayton and me.
Nothing physical, anyway.
Well, why did Clayton say the two of you slept together if you hadn't?
Because he's trying to hide something about himself from Blanche.
I don't even feel right saying it out loud.
Maybe if I just whispered it.
Clayton is a hobo?
No, Dorothy.
Oh!
Oh!
Now, now I get it.
Oh, good.
I thought I was gonna have to draw you a picture.
And I'm not sure I'd know how.
Hey!
I don't get to know?
No, Ma.
OK, have it your way, but nobody can keep a secret from Sophia Petrillo.
Whatever that guy's hiding, I could smoke it out of him in three or four quick questions.
Hello, ladies.
Perfect timing.
Ma.
So, Clayton, what do you think of this Miami weather so far?
Oh, it's lovely.
I see.
Have you ever been to Europe?
No, but it's always been a dream of mine.
Interesting.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
Fine.
You can go back in the living room now.
The man's as gay as a picnic basket.
Ma, that... that is...
That is incredible.
How did you know?
I heard him singing in the shower.
He's the only man I ever knew who knows all the words to "Send In The Clowns."
Rose, I owe you an apology.
You sure do.
I shouldn't have got you mixed up in all this.
It's just so hard to tell Blanche the truth.
Clayton, you're selling your sister short.
Now, at times, Blanche can be very understanding and compassionate and forgiving.
Get away from my baby brother, you cradle-snatching, empty-headed, two-faced dummy.
And then at other times she can be a real bitch.
Blanche, there's something you should know.
Butt out, Clayton.
This doesn't concern you.
It most certainly does concern him.
Why?
Because he was seduced by a bubble-head whose hair looks like it was colorized by Ted Turner?
Now, just a minute.
Butt out, Clayton.
This doesn't concern you.
You're gonna regret this when you have to come begging on hands and knees for forgiveness.
Oh?
Then I shall never regret it, because I never intend to apologize.
We'll see about that.
I wish you hadn't done that, Blanche.
Oh, hush up.
It was for your own good.
There's something you just don't understand.
Oh, I understand perfectly.
I pushed you into meeting all those women.
That's why this happened.
But it is over.
Rose will be just fine.
Blanche, it's not as simple...
Oh, Clayton, honey, leave it alone.
Blanche, listen.
Nothing happened between me and Rose.
Just like nothing ever happens between me and any of the women you set me up with.
There's a reason.
What are you saying, Clayton?
I'm saying...
I'm gay, Blanche.
Oh, Clayton, please be serious.
You're just saying that so I won't set you up with any more women.
No, Blanche.
Well, then you're saying it 'cause you're trying to get back at me for something.
Blanche...
Clay, I know you too well for this.
After all, I know it can't be true.
You're my brother.
It's true, Blanche.
Maybe I ought to just leave you alone for a while.
Clayton Hollingsworth.
You look me in the face and tell me you really are what you just said you are.
I think you heard me the first time, Blanche.
Hey, Harry.
Flip on the game, will you?
Not another game.
Come on.
Tina, let's go.
I'll see you back at the house.
(crowd cheering on TV)
Clayton.
Blanche.
How'd you find me here?
Well, I knew that you and Rose were here last night.
May I join you?
Of course.
Thank you.
You know what that popcorn reminds me of?
Rex's Drive-In out at the lake.
You remember the night my date and I parked right next to you and your date?
Pretty soon it got to be a contest who could fog up whose car the fastest.
I think you won.
You weren't doing too badly considering you were in a convertible.
Yes.
You know,
Clay, I've been thinking a lot about what you told me today, and I've also been thinking a lot about that boy at Rex's Drive-In, and, honey, the two pictures don't go together.
There's just something wrong with one of them.
But it's not the one you're hoping, Blanche.
It was the heater fogging up my car windows that night.
So what can I bring you, sweetheart?
Don't you dare talk to him like that.
Now, you get out of here.
Blanche, I think he was talking to you.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm having a little trouble putting this all together.
Clayton, I just feel like I don't know you anymore.
I'm the same person I always was.
No, you're not.
You used to be just like me.
What?
Great-looking?
Yes.
Charming?
Yes.
Irresistible to men?
My God, Clayton, you are me.
But I still just can't...
Blanche.
I spent a long time lying to myself.
It felt a lot better when I stopped.
It feels better being honest with you, too, and I'd hate to think that this is gonna keep us from being friends.
Well, honey, of course it isn't.
Oh, no.
I'll get used to this.
I will.
Well, look at me already.
I'm practically comfortable seeing you here in a gay bar.
Blanche, this isn't a gay bar.
Clay, now, we did say we were gonna be honest with each other.
All right, now, I can do my part.
You just watch this.
You all, over at the bar.
I just want to say that I would be very proud to have any one of you date my brother.
I'd rather date you, lady.
Sweet Jesus, I've just done the impossible.
I've converted one.
(door opens)
Dorothy, get dressed.
We're going out to celebrate Clayton's last night in town.
Oh, terrific.
Let's go to José's.
We always go there to celebrate.
The food is great.
And they make all the waiters wear these really skintight bullfighters' pants.
Really?
Let's go to Amelio's.
T minus ten seconds, Dorothy.
Oh, Ma, will you give it up?
You are not dying.
Eight, seven, six...
There is not going to be a doorbell or a pop.
...five, four, three, two one.
There is not going to be anything.
You see?
Ten seconds, nothing happened.
(doorbell)
Oh, God!
Ma, stop.
Oh, suddenly somebody believes me.
Did I hear the bell?
Listen, Rose, do me a favor.
Look out the peephole and see who's at the door.
Sure, Dorothy.
Gee, it's kinda hard to tell.
All I can see is a fedora.
Oh, my God.
Who's that at the door?
It's me, Blanche.
The other side.
Move, Rose.
Ma, don't.
I have to, Dorothy.
Ma!
Mildred, what are you doing here?
When do I always wear my lucky bowling hat?
We're bowling tonight?
Didn't you get my message the other night?
No one answered the door.
I figured you were napping, so I yelled outside your window we had room.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Were your exact words,
"Sophia, you can come now.
We have room now"?
And were you wearing that hat at the time?
Yes.
Hasta luego, Dorothy.
I'm going bowling.
Well, let's go to dinner, ladies.
Have fun.
Rose, honey.
There's something I have to say to you.
It's just two little words, but they are the hardest two little words in all the whole world for me to say.
"Not tonight"?
No.
Blanche, if you've come here to apologize, I accept.
Just like that?
Yes.
I mean, for me, just the fact that you thought of those words is plenty... considering what a selfish, conceited person you are.
But I had a whole speech planned, Rose... a-about how nice you were to my brother and-and how proud I am to have such a sweet person as my friend.
Now I can't say it.
Well, sure you can.
No, I can't.
You just ruined it.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I forgive you, Rose.
I feel like creating cat today.
Gimme a cat.
Give it four legs, some fur.
Fangs!
And some surprises.
It's eyes should shine in the dark and it should always land on its feet.
Oh sure...
Give cat six eyes.
Eh, we only have two eyes left.
Two eyes.
I like that.
Cranium: 23 pantenes.
Jaws: 12 photons.
No eyebrows.
Nice.
Huh, notice how the heavy lids give it an arrogant yet warm expression.
Nice job staff.
You designed the perfect animal.
Cat.
However there is one finishing touch.
Give it nine lives.
What?
I don't understand.
Why 9?
Nine?
But everyone else gets one life.
Well let just say it would make a great plot for a story, OK.

In my first life I formulated many of my likes and dislikes.
I dislike my rock bed.
On the other hand, you wouldn't believe the size of the pteranodon drumsticks.
About ten million years ago the first cat crawled out of the sea.
His first word was...
Uuaahh.
He had been holding his breath for quite some time.
In those days the first everything was crawling up out of the sea.
The first snake.
The first chicken.
Crabgrass.
The first real estate salesman.
And then came the first girl cat.
Woman!
C'mere.
C'mere.
Woman!
Cat!
"Cat" was caveman talk for darn it!
It wasn't long before cave cat learned to talk.
Foom.
Foom?
Foom.
Ah, no no.
Meow.
Meow!
Meow.
Me-ow.
Meow.
Meow.
Caveman soon domesticated cave cat.
Mrrroww mrrroww.
Good cat, good cat.
Soon cave cat learned to live with his human counterpart and spent his time pretty much as cats do now.
Ahem, except for the fire breathing mice.
Ah, yes, those were simple times.
Times when people had to entertain themselves.
Big Bob come!
Who big Bob.
Big Bob big.
Ugh.
Big Bob bad.
Ugh.
Big Bob go whoomp, whoomp, whoomp.
Fear big Bob.
Big Bob.
Hence cats instinctive fear of dogs.
Big Bob slobbered and ran away.
Cave cat gave big Bob a piece of his mind.
Aha, big Bob!
Cave cat go whoomp, whoomp, whoomp.
Ooh, stay away big Bob or cave cat go whoomp, whoomp, whoomp.
Alas big Bob returned with the worlds first and last crab tree.
He wanted to play fetch.
Thus, the worlds first and last cave cat bought the farm, for failing to field the fetched crab tree.
2,000 BC.
Was a good year to be a cat in Egypt.
We were revered, even worshiped.
Ah, for the good old days.
Ancient Egypt wasn't the arid wasteland you might expect.
Naw, it was bustling with activity in 2,000 BC.
The pyramids were still under construction.
In those days we cats were venerated and worshiped because of the cat goddess Bastet.
She was the head of the hierarchy of animal gods.
This was one Egyptian belief that certainly got no argument from us cats.
Me, I was known as king cat.
I was the favorite cat of King Amenhotep the 3rd
I called him junior.
Those were happy days
I had my own personal bevy of slave dogs.
And for fun I would go over to the pyramids and torture the construction workers.
To the pyramids you mutts, lets get a move on.
It doesn't get any better than this.
Stay.
Did I ever tell you I love it when you grovel?
Okay, okay, enough adoration.
Back to work!
Whoomp whoomp boring.
Whoomp whoomp boring.
Whoomp whoomp boring.
You know guys...
What if we built a cube instead of a pyramid?
- Cube?
!
?
- What?
- No!
OK, OK.
Big babies.
Whoomp whoomp boring.
Whoomp whoomp boring.
Whoomp whoomp boring.
Whoomp whoomp boring.
Whoomp whoomp boring.
Alright you back to work.
We got a deadline to meet you know.
I want these pyramids built by Thursday.
Hay, have a heart mate I'm doing the best I can.
If you know whats good for you, you'll get your shoulder back to the stone.
Yeah, I'd like to get your shoulder back to the stone.
What was that!
I-I-I just said.
If you know whats good for you.
You'd be back at the temple rather than here picking on us poor slaves.
And just what is that suppose to mean?
Read the glyphs mate, writings on the wall.
I don't like the looks of this.
That's right mate.
When the king croaks, he takes all his worldly possessions with him.
And you are a possession.
Get the picture?
I got the picture all to clearly.
Old Jr's. is not even bright enough to come in out of a sandstorm.
And then to complicate the situation his evil brother prince Black Bart has had his eyes on the throne for some time now.
Ooh, if my lifespan is to coincide with Jr's.
I'd better get back there and protect him from Bart.
Giddy-up, you doggies!
Time's wasting'!
♪ Daa do Te do Te do. ♪
♪ Doodle de do Te do Te do. ♪
Hay, Junior.
Hay man, you know, I have a surprise for you.

I think your going to be surprised.
Okay.
Mush!
Mush!
Aw, shucks
I don't see any surprise around here.
Ooh, sometimes that Black Bart makes me so mad!
Rats!
Hay, you shoved me.
I like to do more than shove ya'!
I'd like to... ♪ Daa do Te do Te do. ♪
Huh?
I wonder what this is?
Oh well, whatever it is, it probably hasn't been invented yet.
Then again, what do I know?
All dressed up and no place to go, huh Jr.?
What am I laughing about?
I should be conserving oxygen.
These crypts are air tight.
I only have enough air to last about...
Let see this crypt is about 80 by 40 let see a 20 foot ceiling.
Ta ta da ta da ta da
I'll run out of air in ruffly 73 years.
Slave dog!
Boy am I glade to see you.
I'll see to it theirs a little something extra in your next pay check.
I owe you one ol' buddy.
If theirs anything I can ever do for you just let me know.
You know slave dog, its friends like you that keep this tired old world going round.
Be a good dog and run over to the pyramids to see how things are going.
Yes sir.
Right away sir.
Anything you wish sir.
Your wish is my command sir.
I'd like to meet you in a dark alley sometime sir.
Arf.
My third life was my favorite.
My body grew old but I never, never, never, grew up.
Yellow and orange skies filled with magic butterfly's made the morning a memory.
These were the mornings Chloe and the orange kitten liked best.
It seemed like it was always summer in the garden.
Uncle Todd built the garden during a very intense period of just having fun.
He was known for that.
Singing and dancing and being every bit a prankster.
He and the sun laughed a lot.
Uncle Todd joined the circus, one spring and sort of willed the garden to Chloe and the orange kitten.
From then on the spirit of uncle Todd seemed to loom over the plot.
Like a great laughing apparition.
This was not the normal garden you might imagine... no.
It was inspired by the love of life and the even greater love of living it.
The garden had a few of the more identifiable features of course like plants and rocks and some bad things.
But the things they really enjoyed were not of the norm.
Designed into the garden were things like tubes, globes and orbs of the bubble and vinyl persuasion.
The hovering harmonica, the skimming disk made jingle sounds as they glided from point to point.
Their life with syncopated rhythms filled the air.
The great part was as Chloe and the kitten moved from one area of the garden to another the environment would change.
All the areas were for fun making but only a special love and understanding would make the garden work.
They had a very strong bond.
A rare and valuable treasure called friendship.
It was a magic life, an easy life.
A good life.
There was only one condition.
Before uncle Todd joined the circus he left the two a crystal box on a checkered toadstool.
He told them never to open the crystal box.
Chloe and the kitten were not used to rules!
This "never open the crystal box on the checkered toadstool." Rule was new to them.
And as all children all want to do.
Chloe and the kitten were overcome with curiosity.
They poked at the crystal box.
Sniffed it.
And gazed longingly at the simple to open latch.
There is something very special about a box that is not to be opened.
Finally they decided to take action.
They decided not to open it.
Ha, they thought right by the crystal box never to give it another thought.
They loved uncle Todd very much and were grateful for the garden.
And they lived happily forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
I learned to think on my feet in my forth life.
Thinking was okay I guess.
But now I avoid it when ever possible.
The year is 1720.
I am the cat of the court musician to King George I.
My owner is a fellow named George Frederick Handel
I sit around and watch Freddy write music for George's dinner parties.
Freddy's putting the finishing touches on a fugue for a big bash tonight.
Hello Frrreddie, what have we here?
Oh, go away Jester,
I must have this fugue done for tonight or the king will have my neck.
Fugue!
Fugue you say!
This is a very important occasion.
George is expecting a concerto don't you know.
A concerto?
Is there an echo?
That's right governor.
He's expecting a concerto.
Ooh, there's not time!
I cant possible finish a concerto by this evening.
Aw, that's to bad.
Oh well, if we can't enjoy a concert tonight, we'll have fun at the execution!
Execution!
There's that echo again.
Oh well, ta ta Freddy, your concerto had better be good.
You know how Georgie hates to be disappointed.
Here cat!
I will take the first movement, und' the second movement, und you do the finally.
Write fast!
There's not much time.
Your Majesty.
Your Majestress.
For your listing pleasure this evening.
It is my pleasure to present Frrreddie and his chamber quartet, who will play for you an original concerto or so we hope.
On this very auspicious occasion.
Frrreddie, if you please.
After that night, I never wrote any more music.
Had I stuck with it, there would have been the recording contracts, the concerts, the agents, the managers, the roadies, the groupies, it sounded like a lot of work to me.
Life number five was short.
Hay cat!
Your wanted on the set.
I'll be right back.
Cut!
Stunt cat.
Action!
That's a rap.
Six must be my lucky number.
Because that's the life I fell in love with music.
I also fell in love with a girl who played the piano just for me.
Oh, what a pretty day.
Would you like to hear a cat story Patches?
Meow.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.
My eighth birthday turned out to be one of the most memorable days of my life.
That was the day I got a new kitten and I took my first piano lesson.
Oh, I remember it as if it were yesterday.
I was siting at the kitchen table having breakfast, when my mother came into the room.
Happy birthday Sara,
I have something for you.
- Meow.
- A kitten!
Thank you mommy.
If you take good care of your kitten Sara, it will be a good, good friend for a long time to come.
Mother suggested that I name my new kitten Diana after the Roman goddess of the hunt.
Sara, I have another birthday surprise for you.
This is Mrs. Underwood.
She's going to give you piano lessons.
Aw mom, I wanna play with Diana.
Come along Sara.
Some day your going to thank me for this.
Alright Sara, let's begin.
Meow.
Diana!
Are you alright?
Meow!
During the next few months,
I worked very hard at my piano lessons.
Every time I sat down to play
I would feel this little paw on my foot.
Diana was so tiny, she couldn't get up on the piano by herself.
I wanted to be a better piano player because Diana always seemed to sense when I hit a wrong note.
Meow!
In just a few years,
I was becoming, by Diana's standards, a fairly good pianist.
Diana loved my music and never seemed happier than when I was playing.
Those were happy days.
I remember the sunshine, soft summer breezes and the fun Diana and I had.
It seemed as though Diana had been part of my life, forever.
I had even promised Diana, we would never, ever part.
Then came the day I left for college.
Mew.
That was a sad day.
I didn't know who I was going to miss more.
My parents or Diana.
Although I was a young woman by the time I graduated from college, the little girl in me was still eager to be with Diana once again.
By that time my world had changed.
There were more people in my life than Diana and my parents.
Meow.
And I don't know that Diana approved.
Meow.
Mother, father, Lee and I have decided to marry.
That's wonderful dear.
- Rowr!
- Ouch!
Diana.
You'd better pack your bags old girl.
Your going to be moving soon.
Your coming with me.
My parents had given Lee and me the piano as a wedding present.
We really didn't have room for it, but it was our most important piece of furniture.
When little Billy came along,
Diana found a new friend.
I don't think Diana minded, too much.
By now Diana was fourteen.
Diana could no longer make it on her own to the top of the piano.
But fortunately, neither could little Billy.
That evening, I could tell Diana wasn't feeling well.
So, I put Billy to bed early and performed a whole concert, just for Diana.
I'd never played better.
When I finished, Diana didn't want to leave the piano.
Goodnight Diana.
Sometime during the night,
Diana managed to get down onto the keyboard.
She laid down, put her face on her folded paws
and quietly passed away.
It was Diana's testament to her love for my music.
Would you like me to play something for you patches?
Mew.
It's just as well.
In my seventh life I was a laboratory animal.
To this day every time I see a test tube I throw up.
Hold on to that cat good n' tight now Larry.
Easy now fella, easy there.
Mrrroww.
I don't know about you Larry, but these experiments sound like something out of a horror movie to me.
All I know is if this research goes bad,
I'm going to put plenty of distance between me and this laboratory
Larry, get 19-GB ready for dissection.
We'll see if it experience any preliminary organ modification.
Get that cat!
I'm trying!
I'm trying!
Aroo!
Anybody been down this hill?
Way over there by the hedgerow.
Okay, look over here.
Let's call it off guys, we'll never find him now.
All that I ever was made me what I am in my eight life.
Somehow, it's falling short of my expectations.
Welcome to the world little fella.
I think I'll call you Garfield.
I'm hungry.
Where are we mom?
In the kitchen of an Italian restaurant.
Are Italians good to eat?
Oof!
You have a lot to learn Garfield.
Garfield the newborn kitten is getting ready to rub up against his first leg.
On my mark...
Get set...
Rub up.
Whoa!
Ffit'.
Rarrr.
Ffit'.
Ffit'.
I think I'm gonna like this thing called "eating."
Pasta... infinite mountains of pasta.
Garfield 1 fettuccine nothing.
This spaghetti could stand to be cooked a little longer.
Comea' witha' mea' kitty.
You eatena' me outta my business.
I'ma' taken you kitty to the pet shop.
I cant let him stay here.
No, you can't take him.
He's to young.
Aw, come on mom.
I'm a big boy.
I'm five minutes old now.
Besides I'm getting tired of hanging around the house all the time.
Take care of yourself little boy.
I love you.
I love you too, mom.
And thanks for everything you've done for me.
I'll write when I get a chance.
Thanks for the ride.
Hi guys.
So, whats the program here?
Oh, it's simple, all you have to do is look cute.
Someone comes in, buys you, and takes you home.
That shouldn't take long.
Don't count on it.
Old Eli been here seventeen years.
I'm cute, take me home.
Aah!
What's that?
Oh that...
That's a dog.
People actually buy them and take them home as pets.
Hello there, I'd like to buy a cat.
Take me, take me.
I'll catch you mice, fetch your paper, scratch your back, take me.
Well this one seems friendly.
I sleep till noon and I desire my milk tepid.
I require three daily scratchings and I eat a pasta base diet.
No substitutions.
How are you this morning, Garfield?
I'm in a good mood.
I let the mailman live.
Uh... sit down Garfield.
I...
I have something to tell you.
I am sitting down.
Y-you must be lonely.
I think you need a playmate.
Not really, I have my mirror.
So I bought a dog.
Aah!
Oh no!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Your taking it rather badly Garfield.
I think I'm OK now.
Where is this "dog"?
Garfield meet Odie.
Argh!
It's not a dog its a tongue with eyeballs and feet.
It's as though I know Odie from a former life.
A bad one.
Well its taken a lot of hard work, intimidation and abuse.
But it was worth the effort to lay calm to my position as the rightful head of this household.
Odie?
Oh, Odie.
Be a good boy and fetch my slippers.
They're on the wrong feet dummy.
Now run fetch my owner.
You called master.
Ain't life great.
I assume you would like to have lunch now.
Yes and I desire a picnic on the lawn.
You want what?
!
?
Read my lips Jon I want to eat outside today.
Very well sir.
It's hard to find good help.
C'mon Odie.
It's the ice cream truck.
You must have a death wish fella.
If Odie hadn't stopped me I would've been a cat pancake.
A pavement pelt.
A sail cat.
A greasy spot on Main Street.
You saved my life old buddy.
Listen, I may not be wildly successful in this life Odie, but at least I'm alive to live it.
And that means something.
I'll forever be grateful to you Odie.
I'll never forget this.
Arf.
Gather round children, it's story time.
It was back in the 80's or... or was it the 90's?
Who cares.
At any rate, I was the big TV celebrity.
Head of Mouser of some note.
Well sir, one day Odie and I spotted the ice cream truck across the street.
As Odie was just about to run into the street,
I saw this big truck a coming.
I had determined that Odie was going to be seriously hurt if he crossed the street.
And so I wrestled him to the ground at the last minute before the truck came rushing by and squashed him.
I'd like to think I'd live forever but hay, I'm only human.
Here's a sneak preview of my ninth life.
Space...
One thing to be said for space there sure is a lot of it out there.
So what do you do with space?
You can take part in grand intergalactic battles that encompass whole solar systems.
Or you can bravely forge new worlds of exploration by traveling through uncharted territory.
Or you can get lost.
Me...
I'm lost.
Finding out where the heck I am is still secondary though.
What I wanna know is, why am I here?
welcome to space mister cat.
I suppose you are wondering why you are here?
A keen grasp of the obvious.
well it is really quite simple.
you see, all we require is that you survive mister cat.
we are monitoring the survival instincts of a cat in his last life.
In his la...
Wha...
last life?
as you are well aware, a cat has nine lives.
And ah, don't tell me...
I'm living life number nine?
I tell it like it is, baby...
Cakes.
Well that's just great.
Somehow my lives didn't mean so much when I had a few of them to burn.
So here I am in the one that really counts and they stick me in the middle of nowhere in this time bomb.
Well I better gather my wits about me.
My survival sounds like a job for O. D. I. E.
My Operations Data Index Element.
It's the smartest machine in the galaxy.
Hay O.D.I.E., index and read all variables for my survival and give me a progressive plan.
arf.
"Arf" he says.
O.D.I.E. Must have been built by the lowest bidder.
Well, I guess its up to me now.
Just what do I have on hand to survive with.
Lets see.
I have food, water, artificial gravity and sand.
Well time to start surviving.
Lets eat.
Rats!
Oh well, everything tasted like lettuce anyway.
arf. arf, arf.
OK O.D.I.E. What is it?
Hay?
Where's gravity when you need it?
arf. arf, arf.
What are you trying to say O.D.I.E..
Uh-oh.
≡⚡ Hay you, kitty cat. ⚡≡
What?
Who?
≡⚡ I'm Commander Mendelson, ⚡≡
≡⚡ leader of the Incredibly Huge Galactic War Fleet. ⚡≡
≡⚡ The I-H-G-W-F for short. ⚡≡
≡⚡ We do not like you being here. ⚡≡
≡⚡ And to show you we mean business. ⚡≡
≡⚡ We will atomize your craft in 5 minutes. ⚡≡
≡⚡ Any questions?
⚡≡
≡⚡ I said, "any questions!" ⚡≡
Only answers Mack.
Here take this!
I've been de-clawed.
Hay eh, guys.
Could you give me just a little more time.
This place is a fright and I couldn't meet my maker looking like this.
Come on, have a heart.
≡⚡ I'm sorry, we of the I-H-G-W-F, have no hearts. ⚡≡
≡⚡ We do however appreciate the tiny ship. ⚡≡
≡⚡ We will give you seven minutes instead of five. ⚡≡
Gee thanks.
Theirs not much time, I need more hands.
That it, hands.
If I could just get over to the crew cloner here I'll, clone a crew mate.
I hate vending machines.
≡⚡ Six minutes. ⚡≡
Hay Odie we got to do something about this gravity.
That's it the gravity machine.
Pull the handle.
That's better.
Just when things look bleak something goes right.
The plot thickens.
≡⚡ Five minutes!
⚡≡
Now to get those guns working.
Get outta' here.
Shoo, shoo.
Get back.
Why don't you guys play in traffic or something.
That's it!
Odie, take these guys down to the launch platform.
Put these clones in the drones.
We'll launch an all out attack on Commander Mendelson.
And his igwa-waga-haga-waga...
What ever.
Hurry!
OK commander brace yourself.
This cat has a thing or two up his sleeve.
Odie, are the drones in place for launching?
Arf.
Commander Mendelson, Commander Mendelson, are you there?
≡⚡ You have three minutes. ⚡≡
What happened to four minutes?
≡⚡ Well I eh... ⚡≡
You what?
≡⚡ I had to go to the little boys room. ⚡≡
I have a surprise for you commander.
Take this!
Now I really got to get those guns working.
≡⚡ One minute. ⚡≡
Boy what a day.
Lost, no food a twit for a computer, an imbecile for a crew mate but no matter.
I'm a hero and hero's don't die.
We always win our space battles.
This ought a do it.
≡⚡ Zero!
⚡≡
Nice touch.
Names?
Ah...
My name is Garfield and this is my friend Odie.
I understand you boys had a rough go of it in your last life.
Yes sir, and that's why I'm here frankly.
I know cats have nine lives and I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have them...
I don't think it was fair for anyone to put us in the position we were in.
And I'm sorry but that's the way it is.
Your right.
But sir I...
I'm right?
Yes you are.
You may have your life back.
Ooh, by the way, which life was that?
You mean... w-which life of my nine was that?
Yes.
You mean you don't keep track?
Normally I do but our computers are on the blink right now.
Why that was my um...
My first life sir.
Very well, and your entitled to all nine lives.
And your friend there is he a cat too?
Well...
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.
Meow.
Then so be it.
You both have all nine lives.
We have to stick together you know.

You know, when my students ask about '88 I always tell them... that the only thing worse than the indignity of campaigning back then... is the horror of campaigning now.
'88 was the year the curtain on our private lives got pulled back.
That was the year the media took down Gary Hart for having a mistress.
And after that, everyone, everything became fair game.
In '88,Johnny Carson might have done a couple of slightly risqué jokes about Hart.
But 1 0 years later,Jay Leno's doing six blow-job jokes a night on Clinton.
Everything changed.
Did you know that before Bush ran in 2000... he investigated himself?
He actually hired a detective to find out what he'd done.
And not because he was too impaired to remember... but because preemptive dirt-digging just makes good sense today.
If you've lived an imperfect life - and who hasn't - and you've left a paper trail... or living witnesses... you better know about it before you start, because you can bet it'll come out later.
That's why I released my own F.B.I. file.
You gotta bust yourself first.
Take the fun out of it for the media.
Take a five-day story, make it two.
But let's be clear.
There's a price to a candidacy.
The more you reveal of yourself... the more your personal narrative - good and bad - becomes public domain... the harder it is to hold on to what it means.
By the end of the campaign, I'd look in the mirror and say, "Jack who?"
[ Man ] Stand by, open.
Open's up.
Stand by,Jack's mike.
[ Announcer ] This is WMUR-TV's NewsNine New Hampshire Close-Up...
-[ Man ] We'll go in five, four, three...
-a weekly discussion of news...
- two, one- -and political events that affect New Hampshire.
- Mike, and cue him, please.
- Welcome to Close-Up.
I'm Jack Heath.
Well, the cold weather has been big news this week, as we all can testify... and cold weather has caught up to some of us... including those who chase the would-be presidential candidates around the state.
Despite the cold weather, things are heating up with the New Hampshire primary.
Our guest this week is one more candidate... who wants to be the next president of the United States.
He is Jack Tanner, and he wants you to know that he's a serious Democratic candidate... for the presidential nomination.
Well, who is Jack Tanner, and where did he come from?
Good morning, Mr. Tanner.
- Good morning,Jack.
Nice to meet you.
- Where did you come from?
- East Lansing, Michigan.
- [ Smattering Of Applause ]
- And Warm Springs, Georgia.
- [ Hooting, Applause Continues ]
- San Antonio, Texas?
- [ Whistling, Applause Continues ]
And... how about Walla Walla, Washington?
[ Cheering, Applause Continues ]
Riverside, California.
[ Heath ] And, uh, Pearl Harbor?
Well, let's not forget Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
I was born in Pearl Harbor.
You know, I have to say,Jack, you sound like George Bush a little bit, the vice president.
- It's hard to know what state he's from.
- Well, that's true.
But I actually lived in all these states.
I was an air force dependent.
And as you know, when you're an air force dependent you move around a lot.
[ Heath ] I know you've been out- You resigned from the House in 1 976.
I saw Gary Hart the other day, and he says you've been out of it too long.
What do you say to that?
Well, I guess Mr. Hart has been busier than I have, but, uh -
I think the national impression of you... is that you had a unanimous draft from your state to run for Congress.
You were a popular congressman.
On a sadder note, I know your daughter had a serious illness.
- Yes, she had.
- But you got out, and now you're back in.
Tell us what brought you back into this crazy world of running for president.
Well, I mean, it's always presumptuous to say that you wanna... be the leader of this country... but I felt that the way things looked... the way this race is wide open, the sort of lack of leadership that's been demonstrated... the way, to my thinking, we've gone way, way off the track in the last eight years... uh, the issues are there.
You also stand out from some of the candidates...
- 'cause you received a Ph.D.
- Yes.
Tell me.
Do you feel - I don't wanna put it bluntly-
- Do you feel smarter than some of the people running for president?
- Yes.
[ Male, Female Singers ] Exercise your right to vote
Choose the one you like the most
It's your individual right
To choose the one you want to fight for you
[ Woman ] Mm-hmm.
I got the media buy for the 1 4th, two days before the primary.
Yeah, we got Bz in Boston- that's NBC.
And WMURin Manchester.
Yeah.
[ Man ] Broder did a follow-up on Iowa.
He didn't even mention him.
[ Woman ] Jack, this is a great position.
I'm working on the other two stations.
Our main problem seems to be money.
- [ Man #1 ] Gore was right about Iowa.
- [ Man #2 ] The thing I told Jack about Iowa... is that there's hardly any point.
- You've gotta get there two years ahead.
- [ Woman ] Resnick's being such a hard-ass.
[ Man #2 ] You've gotta gain their confidence, marry their daughters, fix their plumbing.
[ Man #1 ] Iowa, we hardly knew ye, ye hardly knew us.
-[ Woman Laughing ] Yeah.
-[ Man #1 ] Fuck ye.
[ Man #2 ] Where is Deke with the film?
[ Woman ] Deke's supposed to be coming here with a rough cut, but I haven't seen it yet.
- No,Jack, we can't change one thing.
-[ Woman #2 ] Do you save this half-and-half?
.
- 'Cause I could use it for that homeless project.
- That's fine, Andrea.
Thanks a lot.
[ Man #2 ] Hey, listen, where are my hash browns?
- Are those my hash browns, Stringer?
-[ Stringer ] Oh,yes, they are.!
-[ Andrea ] Want me to get you some more?
-[ Woman #1 ]Jack,you're in charge.
[ Man #2 ] On second thought, you can have these back.
[ Stringer ] Hey, we made Haley's column today.!
[ Man #2 ] Is it a positive?
[ Stringer ] Oh,yeah, i-it's a positive... not.
[ Woman #1 ] I can't wait to see ya.
Yeah, we're working real hard.
Okay.
Get on that plane.
All right.
Good-bye.
Bye-bye.
- Damn it!
- [ Stringer ] What?
- His plane was grounded in Durham.
- [ Andrea ] I was in Durham once.
- [ Man #2 ] But he's gonna be here, right?
- Yeah, he'll be here.
- Here's something you don't see every day.
-[ Woman #1 ] What?
[ Stringer ] The word "debacle"used twice in the same sentence.
Come on!
Nobody edits that paper.
- It's computers in some room.
-[ Woman #1 ] What's going on with the focus group?
- Has Hughes arrived yet?
- [ Man #2 ] Yeah, Hughes is in the hotel.
He's getting all the stuff set up and everything.
He was under the impression that he was testing some spots for Super Tuesday, but [ Conversation Continues ] - [ Woman On TV] Go, Tanner!
Go, Tanner!
Go, Tanner!
-Jack Tanner for the homeless!
- [ Stringer ] "The Future Is Now.!"
[ Woman #1 Chuckles ]
[ Stringer ] Uh, they're coming in about 1 0:00.
- There should be about 30 people.
- [ Man #2 ] That's a good number.
[ Woman #1 ] We're not gonna have a thing to show him.
Stringer, see if you can find Deke.
[ Andrea ] Should I start setting up the chairs
- Oh, here he is.
- Showtime.
- [ Laughs ]
- [ Humming: "Hail to the Chief' ] - [ Man #2 ] Did you make all the changes?
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the next president of the United States...
Mr.Jack Tanner.
- Whoo!
- [ Humming Continues ]
[ Tone Beeping ]
[ Woman #1 Sighs ] I thought-
I thought he was gonna be raking leaves.
People vote in November,you know.
Hi.
How are you?
Good to see you.
- Come on up.
- [ Deke ] I can't control the weather.
[ Phone Ringing ]
Oops.
There's my phone.
- [ Staffers Snickering, Laughing ] - [ Phone Continues Ringing ]
-[ Woman #1 ] Deke?
- What?
[ Woman #1 ] What's with the Mister Rogers opening?
[ Deke ] Come on.
Think Pee-wee's Playhouse.
[ Phone Continues Ringing ]
Hello?
[ Dramatic Fanfare ]
[ Announcer ] Early last year... in a modest family home in East Lansing, Michigan... a phone began to ring.
At first there were only a few calls a day.
Then several.
Then the phone began to ring off the hook.
The callers?
Community leaders... public officials, party officers... from all around the country.
The message?
We wantJack Tanner for president.
I'm glad you called.
[ Announcer ] Who's Jack Tanner?
[ Continues ]
[ Andrea ] He looks really handsome.
- [ Deke ] Ooh!
You notice that transition?
- [ Woman #1 ] I like it.
Yeah.
[ Stringer ] Nice.
- [ Announcer] The son of a career army air force officer- - [ Stringer ] That's notJack.
-John Quentin Tanner was born in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii...
- Oh, his mother is beautiful.
- [ Man #2 ] Quentin.
Should he use that?
- on May 1 , 1 938.
- Three years later...
- Wait.!
Aren't those American planes?
- [ Deke ] Aplane's a plane.
- [ Laughing ]
Not in Pearl Harbor it isn't.
[ Franklin Delano Roosevelt ] December 7, 1 941 ... a date which will live -
Is that Woodrow - That is Woodrow Wilson's voice!
Deke, this footage looks very-very familiar.
This looks very familiar.
I lifted it from a Dole film campaign.
- You what?
- What?
Well, I mean, hell, he lifted it from stock, right?
Y-You don't really think they sent a crew out to film a future wounded president, do ya?
-[ Man #2 ]Jack's father was a pilot.
-[ Stringer ] We'll have to use Bush's footage.
Right.
Is Bush a pilot?
[ Laughing ]
[ Announcer] Young Jack learned firsthand about the rigors of [ Stringer ] Oh, this is dignified.
-[ All Laugh ]
[ Woman #1 ] I really think they don't have to scoot across the floor on their derrieres.
[ Andrea ] Men in underwear.
Men in underwear rate very highly with women.
- This is more stock footage.
- He's a team player.
That's what we're getting at.
[ Andrea ] Do you have to rate a film like this?
- They don't use this play anymore.
- "G, " "PG, " "R"?
[ Deke ] Wait a second.
[ Game Announcer] Davis on the rebound!
- [ Man #2 ] Deke, is that your voice?
- Yeah!
- [ Deke Announcing ] The game goes into overtime.
- Wilt Chamberlain.
- [ Deke Announcing ] Tanner is down.
- I wanna associate him with the big guys.
This could be a real blow for theJayhawks.
Tanner is out of the game.
[ Woman #1 ] Oh, I love that face.!
Vote for that man.
[ Announcer ]Jack became a tireless leader in the civil rights and antiwar movements.
[ Rock Guitar:
Ballad ]
- What happened?
- [ Stringer ] Can you fix that?
Is thatjust on the monitor or-
Well, you can play off of that one.
[ Woman #1 ] Where'd you get the civil rights stuff, Deke?
Uh, off a You Are There- an old You Are There.
- Yeah, the old Walter Cronkite show.
- I love this speech.
[ Kennedy ] Ask what you can do for your country.
- [ Staffers Exclaiming ]
- Ooh.!
Down on a play.!
- I have a dream today!
- [ Cheering ]
[ Woman #1 ] Is this Walter Cronkite?
Who owns the rights?
[ Stringer ] Michael Jackson. [ Chuckling ]
- [ Singing Along With Guitar]
- I loved that video.
The MichaelJackson video?
One small step for man... one giant leap for mankind.
[ Man #2 ] Right.
Use Michael Jackson doing the moonwalk.
[ Announcer ] During the turbulent '60s...
Jack's effectiveness as an activist and community organizer... eventually led to a successful run for Congress in 1 970.
- "I read the news today, oh, boy. "
- I buried Paul Simon.
[ Stringer Chuckling ]
[ Andrea ] Oh, if you do the record backwards?
- [ Announcer] Once in office...
- Yeah.
Congressman Tanner proved himself an astute and capable legislator.
- Out front on such critical issues...
- [ Man #2 ] What's that?
- [ Deke ] It's a balloon.
- as the environment and consumer safety [ Man #2 ] What's this?
Eggs?
- W-Why eggs?
There's a lot of chicken farmers in New Hampshire.
[ Woman #1 ] Maybe we could take a second look at that.
- [ Man #2 ] Yeah, that should go.
- [ Stringer ] That's nice light.
[ Announcer] Landslide reelections followed...
- and the future looked bright.
- [ Stringer ] "Sound Solution Muffler. "
Oh, it's Love, American Style.
[ Announcer ] But in 1 976-
[ Woman #1 ] Uh, Deke, I'm not real wild about his poster burning up.
[ All Talking Simultaneously ]
[ Woman #1 ] Okay, guys, quiet!
- Where'd you get these pictures ofhis daughter?
-[ Deke ] His bedroom.
[ Announcer ] His only child, eight-year-old Alexandra... was stricken with Hodgkin's disease... and Jack abruptly resigned from office... in order to spend more time with her.
The Tanners returned to East Lansing... where Alexandra gradually recovered... whileJack resumed part-time teaching... to support his family.
[ Woman #1 ] You gotta cut it, Deke.
He's never gonna go for that.
[ Announcer] For a man as devoted to public service as Jack Tanner, it was a difficult decision.
Don't worry about the color balance.
I can bring that around.
[ Andrea ] Is that really their house?
Well, there's no question... those years in the political wilderness... were tough ones, but they weren't wasted.
I discovered I'd been given a... valuable chance to learn... to challenge my most cherished assumptions... about both myself and my country.
It was a rare opportunity.
And so I engaged.
I took stock.
I read.
I traveled.
But most importantly, I listened.
- He's such an intellectual.
- [ Woman #1 ] Wait a minute.
Where's the rest of that speech?
[ Stringer] That's all he says?
Well, he says more, but I thought it'd be more important to watch him listen.
- He's a listener.
Listen.
Watch.
- [ Woman #1 ] But he had a lot more to say, Deke.
He's got a wonderful quality.
I think when we come in on him, he's coming across very well.
He's steady, he's concentrated, you trust him.
[ Andrea ] He's handsome.
- [ SoftJazz ]
- People today like to talk in terms of limits.
Not too many of them live in New Hampshire.
New Hampshire's on the move.
New Hampshire's accessed the future.
- New Hampshire knows the future's now.
- [ Ends ]
- [ Woman #1 ] All right, okay, look.
- [ Andrea Applauding, Whistling ]
We've got all the shots, all the changes noted.
So you go back and do your work and it's on to New Hampshire!
[ Stringer] T.J.!
[ Chuckling ] We're in New Hampshire.
Oh. [ Chuckles ] Well, then on with New Hampshire!
- Yeah.!
-[ Andrea ] Yeah.!
Are you hungry?

-And I'd like to introduce Dr. -
- Do you wanna take that?
Yeah,just a second - Dr. David Hughes... who's going to help describe some of these gizmos you're holding in your hand.
You don't have to be afraid of Dr. Hughes.
His doctorate is in philosophy.
- All right, talk to you later.
- [ Andrea ] Here, T.J.
- Thank you, honey.
- Thank you very much for coming.
The kind of thing you're going to do today is part of a new technique -
[ Stringer ] We need some space heaters in here because it's freezing.
There's no heat.
- No.
No, that's not gonna be enough.
- Will you please get off the phone?
Take them out of the other rooms.
We need them here.
- [ T.J.] Get off the phone.
- For Tanner.
Yes.
I'll be right there.
Thank you.
- All right, let's go, let's go.
Get two.

I don't want people to freeze to death in there.
Come on!
Come on.

Exactly.
[ Man #2 ] Sir, we're gonna be getting to that.
And we will have heaters as soon as possible.
Andrea, could we, uh- Thank you very much.
[ Man ] Could we get on with this?
I've got things to do.!
In case I haven't introduced myself to you, my name is Emile Berkoff.
I'm the pollster for the Tanner campaign.
Excuse me
- Miss Cavanaugh, they're really complaining about the cold.
I know.
Stringer just went out for heaters.
He's gonna be back in a minute with, hopefully, two of them.
- Okay, 'cause they're complaining a lot.
- Give them some coffee.
- What, from room service?
- We don't have money for room service.
- Get the coffee in there.
There's a ton of it.
- Oh, great!
- Oh, it's already made!
- Yeah.
Is Mr. Tanner gonna be here soon?
I really want them all to meet him.
He's not gonna be here.
He's having a television session at a farmhouse this afternoon.
[ Anthony ] Farmer Bob?
You're not setting up with Farmer Bob.
He's right across the street from the airport.
Every politician-
[ T.J.] I know, but he is conveniently located, and besides, he had an opening.

Mrs. Bob's got plenty to do without having to mop up after people.
I'm sorry.
Forgive us.
Oh, those Minicam people are the worst.
I've seen Holsteins with better manners.
[ Alex, Tanner Laughing ]

Yes, we are.
WMURwere sending over a TV crew to -

You gotta try to be here on time.
Sent 'em away?
How could he send 'em away?
We have to get them back.

Here.
- All right.
All right.
- Practically everybody-
- Hello.
everybody takes it black.
Except Gephardt.
He turned his coffee into a damned milk shake!
Do you have Sweet Low?
My dad likes Sweet Low.
- No, I don't, actually.
I drink it black.
- I hope this is tolerable.
- It's not as fresh as it was 40 minutes ago.
- Thank you!
Mrs. Bob didn't really take to that Gephardt fella too much.
Thank you.
She ca
- No, no, no, that's yours.
I don't drink coffee.
She called him a blow-dried blowhard.
[ Tanner Laughing ] Is that right?
Okay, so you all have the idea of the importance of opinions.
And, of course, what we're doing here today is very important to the candidate.
What is Deke doing with that damn camera?
Why is he shooting these people?
What's the point?
[ Hughes ] We're going to use that scale which is on the box... and you notice it goes from "very unfavorable, "which is "1"... to "very favorable," which is "7."
I need a flight reservation for a Dr. G. David Hughes.
- Deke, why are you shooting these people?
-Just something of my own I'm working on.
Don't worry.
I'm not paying for the tapes.
[ T.J.] Well, what are you doing?
It's a neorealistic political film documentary, actually.
Excuse me.!
Excuse me.
Would you mind if I took your picture here?
All right?
All right.
There we go.
Oh, good!
Hey
- Ohh.!
Thank you so much.!
That's good.
That flash, it doesn't work all the time and I have a terrible time -
- They're very funny, those cameras -
- I know it.
She's not really committed yet.
I-I'm probably gonna vote for, uh, "Dudakis."
Well, now, you don't wanna vote for a guy unless you know his name.
Know his name?
- Isn't that good?
- That looks just like him.
And then I've got a whole batch of Kemps here.
But I thought that my neighbor down the road, Ellie Duncan, would trade me some of her Doles.
Then I would have a complete set with this fella.
Listen, I want you to sign in my guest book.
- All right?
- Sure.
I'd be glad to.
Here we go.
All right.
- You've got 'em all, haven't you?
- Yeah, sure.
Robertson.
Kemp.
That's a pretty scary page.
[ Farmer Bob Laughing ] The whole rogues'gallery.!
You want me here under Smilin' Al Haig?
Would you like a button?
No, thanks.
I don't collect those buttons.
I collect the Polaroids instead.
Sure.
[ Mrs. Bob ] Margaret Burke does those.
- There you go.
- "Jack Tanner"?
- Who's that?
- [ Mrs. Bob ] Never heard ofhim.
Now, please dial your political philosophy.
Number one if you're a conservative...
- [ Chanting ] It's time to work the vote!
George Bush ain't got no stones!
- number two if you're a liberal... and press the button on top of your box to enter.
- It's time to work the vote!
- But dial first, then press the button.
[ Laughing, Chattering ]
[ Chanting ] It's time to work the vote.!
It's time to work the vote.!
- Excuse me!
- It's time to work the vote!
- This is Jack Tanner's -
- Al Haig kicks ass!
His balls are brass!
It's time [ T.J.] Excuse me-
- We're in the middle of a meeting.
No, we got an Al Haig vote-a-thon we gotta be at!
- What is this?
- You've got the wrong room.
-Jack Tanner?
That bum?
Give me a break!
- Didn't he drop out?
[ Andrea ] Oh, Stringer.!
The heaters.!
The heaters.!
[ Shouting, Chattering Continues ]
Okay, guys,just get the fuck outta here!
- Whoa!
She means business, man.
- Al Haig!
- Go on.
- [ Participants Chattering, Applauding ]
- Yea!
- Yeah!
[ Applause Continues ]
[ Chuckles ] He's 1 .2 in the polls.
- They get nervous, they get angry.
- [ Laughing ]
Okay-You know, let's have some pizza.
You want some pizza?
- [ Cheering, Applauding ]
- Good.
[ Man #1 ] Sees your pieces occasionally.
Pretty good stuff.
[ Man #2 ] Thanks.
How's Elizabeth?
Did you ever marry that tall blonde that wore the retainer?
[ Man #1 ] No, I didn't.
- She was crazy.
- She was a hophead.
- She was a drunk.
- Oh, God.
- [ Alex ] Who's that?
- [ Tanner] I know him.
-[ Man #1 ] So, the question I asked you- -[ Man #2 ]Jack.!
He's our entourage.
His name's Hayes Taggerty.
He's with the Boston Globe.
- [ Tanner ] Hiya, Hayes.
-Jack.
- How you doin'?
- I been trying to catch up with you all day.
You were supposed to be at Farmer Bob's at 1 0:00.
Well, you're media, right?
I mean, you're not just individuals.
[ Laughing ]
That guy hasn't been the same since Carter posed with his chickens in '7 6.
- This is Frank Gatlin from Time.
- Time magazine.
Oh.
Really.
I - I guess I'm coming up in the world.
I gotta get going.
I've got a meeting down - an assignment in Concord.
[ Tanner ] Oh.
Nice to meet you, anyway.
[ Alex ] It would only take a couple minutes.
-[ Alex ] It would be valuable time spent.
- He worked with my father.
- Yeah?
- He's a good man.
-Alex?
- Yeah?
I'm sorry.
What?
- He married the craziest girl-
- This is a friend of mine, Hayes Taggerty.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Taggerty.
- Let me see.
B.U., right?
- Yes.
- Second year.
- Yes.
Arrested in the shantytown incident.
Suspension revoked.
Right?
Why?
Do you support apartheid, Mr. Taggerty?
Where do you get this stuff, Hayes?
[ Laughing ] The interest is there,Jack.
Listen, I'm writing a series of columns... on the events and figures that helped shape the characters of the various candidates.
- Oh, great.
- Which am I?
A figure or an event?
- [ Tanner ] This is great.
- [ Laughs ] She's charming.
- [ Radio:
Country ]
- Afternoon.
Can I get 1 0 of your large pizzas, please?
As quick as you can.
- Sure.
Ten large pizzas?
- Yeah.
- Would you like something on 'em?
- No, nothing.
- How long's that gonna take?
- About 20, 25 minutes.
Uh, 1 5, 20?
That'd be great.
I'm in a hurry.
- Push 'em in for ya.
- Let me get a milk while I'm waiting.
- Okay, the name?
-Stringer.
All right, very good.
Okay, here's your milk.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Uh, Vinnie, better make that nine.
- Okay.
No problem.
- Thanks.
[ Radio:
Man Singing ] They say you're wanted for robbin'
The grocery store
Disguised as a little old lady
I'm a backpacker It's my money you are after
I consider you armed and crazy
- [ Man ] Hey, Stringer.
- [ Radio Continues ]
Hard to find a good massage parlor when you're on the road, isn't it?
- You're the expert, Rogan.
- Yeah, I used to be.
When your candidate's hot, you gotta send out.
You know what I mean?
- When you gonna get yourself a job?
- Enjoying your 1 5 minutes, are you, Rogan?
What can I say?
The Duke cuts it in New Hampshire.
Hell, folks around here, they like tooling' down I-95... just to see what the economic miracle looks like.
Yeah, and what it looks like is an S.D.I. pig-out.
Reagan's buildup saved Dukakis's ass.
If his own party had won, he'd now be selling elevator shoes in South Boston.
If that mouth of yours had a real home, Stringer-
Look, you ever get over your aversion to winning... call me at campaign headquarters.
I'd call yours, but I wouldn't want to tie up the lines at the Sleepy Bear Motor Lodge.
Oh, and, Stringer...
Gore's got enough problems without you canceling his volunteer meetings.
[ Radio Continues ]
Armed and crazy Armed and crazy
-[ Women Laughing, Chattering ] -[ Woman ] And as you can see... all of these quilts have been signed by celebrities.
- Oh, yes.
- Governor Sununu.
- And Annette Funicello.
- Oh!
And Mildred is working on Paul Newman.
He comes here every year to race his racing cars.
[ Tanner ] Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
- [ Laughing, Chattering Continue ] - [ Woman ] Hi.
How ya doin'?
Who's Congressman Tanner?
He's the, uh, male one.
If you would be willing to autograph one of our squares, we'd be so honored.
- Oh, I'd be more than happy to.
- Mildred, would you hand me that?
Thank you.
- It's for a good cause.
- Mm-hmm.
The quilts will be auctioned off... and the proceeds will go to benefit the library at Trinity School.
Now, you just take this pen and you write your name.
[ Woman ] Ladies.
Ladies.!
Whoo-hoo.!
Whoo-hoo.!
Whoo-hoo.!
- Ladies!
- [ Chattering Subsides ]
In case some of you don't know... this handsome gentleman is Congressman Jack Tanner... and he's graciously consented to sign one of our squares.
[ Chattering Resumes ]
He's also agreed-
He's also agreed to say a few words to us.
So let's give him a warm ladies auxiliary welcome.
[ Tanner ] Thank you very much, ladies.
It's a pleasure to be here.
Um, I'd like to, first of all, introduce my daughter Alex.
- She's up here helping me.
- [ Women Offering Greetings ]
- [ Woman ] Like to make a quilt?
- And, uh, I wanted to say, uh...
- [ Chattering Resumes ] first of all, I'm inspired to say that, um [ Woman ] Welcome to New Hampshire.
- [ Alex ] Thank you.
- this beautiful work...
- Are you helping run [ Chattering Continues ] - moves me to say that I think there's a lot -
I'd like to say something about volunteerism in this country.
- [ Woman ] Your first trip to New Hampshire?
- [ Alex ] Uh, yes!
- Volunteerism is a - - [ Ladies Chattering Excitedly ]
[ Woman ] Why isn't your mother with you?
-[ Tanner ] I just wanted to say...
- Uh, she's in California.
- a couple of things about volunteerism.
- Where it's warm.
- Volunteerism
- People like yourselves...
- No, she's not.
My parents are divorced.
- are truly the backbone of this country.
- [ Women ] Aww.!
This country, without women like yourselves-
- Excuse me.
- Boston U., sophomore year.
I told you people were interested in this kind of stuff.
[ Woman ] Would you like to try embroidery?
- I think you should take a picture.
- I don't think I'm very good at it.
Now, you put your needle in, and then back up again.
- And hold it firmly.
Okay?
- Who's this, now?
This is Bert Convy.
You know Bert Convy.
Oh.
Bert Convy.
[ Chattering Continues, Loud ]
[ Hayes ] Tanner... sews up New Hampshire.
-[ Women Laughing ]
- Leaves 'em in stitches.
[ Tanner] "ForJesseJackson, New Hampshire's an anomaly.
"So why does Jackson seek validation in this icy political no-man's-land?
"One might as well ask...
"why the boy born to Helen Jackson and Noah Robinson, Sr....
"that October night in 1 941 ...
"spent his childhood in pursuit of legitimacy.
Shamed by the taunts of-"
Jesus, Hayes, you don't miss a Freudian freckle, do you?
Hey, it's the only way to understand the man,Jack.
I mean, it's easy to evaluate the manager.
But the leader, that's something else.
You have to determine not just what the candidate is... but why.
You have to ask what drives him.
Listen,Jack, don't get me wrong.
I haven'tjoined the character cops yet.
And unless you start twirling your trousers around your head like Hart...
I'm really not interested.
- Why are you driving?
- What?
You've never driven me anywhere.
Why are you driving?
You're the candidate.
I'm the advance person.
That means I drive.
[ Sighs ]
She drives.
I didn't even know you had a license.
[ Laughing ] This is good.
[ Tanner] Get out of the car, Hayes.
[ Hughes ] Okay, now, this is the event you've all been waiting for.
You've been wanting to see this Tanner tape... and we want you to respond continuously.
We're all set.
I'm going to go back and turn on the VCR and you just start responding immediately.
Okay, I'll be back in the back room.
Take care of things.
[ Hughes ] Remember to keep dialing continuously.
We need your reactions all the time throughout the tape.
[ Andrea ] I think you're gonna like it, though.
I'm not supposed to say that.
-[ Man ] Start clicking now?
-[ Hughes ] Anytime.
Any feelings you have-
You see that little red dot?
That's the average for the whole group.
And the bar on each side is the standard deviation - that's how much they differ among themselves.
You can see over here -
[ Tanner] There's my phone.
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Emile ] T.J., we're doing fantastic so far.
[ Hughes ] They seem to like the snow scene.
I think they identify with that.
- How's he doing with the women?
- We'll have that in a few minutes.
-[ TV:
Phone Rings ] -[ TV:
Tanner ] Hello?
[ TV:
Dramatic Fanfare ]
[ People Laughing, Chattering ]
[ TV:
Announcer] Early last year, in a modest family home -
[ T.J. ] Is it going down, or is it holding steady?
[ Hughes ] It's going down now.
Look at that.
Way down to three.
- [ TV:
Announcer] Then the phone began to ring off the hook.
- [ TV:
Phone Ringing ]
[ Laughing, Chattering Continues ]
[ TV:
Announcer ] The callers?
Community leaders... public officials, party officers from all around the country.
Where's this guy from?
Shh!
[ Male, Female Singers ] Pick the proper candidate
You can change the course of fate
It's a decision that you must make
Select the one you think is great for you
[ Tanner ] Pat, how are you?
- Hey!
Great to see you!
- This is my daughter Alex.
- Hi.
How are you?
- Hi.
Good.
How are you?
- Sure tearing' 'em up in my home state.
- Well, Michigan is a strong one for me.
- You know that,Jack.
- It made me glad to be a Democrat.
I wouldn't want to be up against you.
Well, the Republicans are gonna be tough this year, but we wish you the best.
- Looking tougher all the time.
- [ Robertson Laughs ]
- Congratulations.
Take care of yourself.
- Thank you,Jack.
What about this term "Christian hardball" we keep hearing?
Are you gonna be throwing at their heads?
I used to be a boxer
- Golden Gloves - and a heavyweight wrestler... and so I'm not afraid of political hardball.
- I just don't want anybody to play dirty.
- You're playing for keeps, though?
Playing for keeps, playing serious, but not dirty.
- All right.
- All right.
-[ Man ] All right.
- Hey, whose mike cord?
Excuse me.
Thank you.
[ Announcer] In 1 97 6...
Jack's young family was struck by personal calamity.
[ TV:
Soft Jazz ]
[ TV:
Announcer ] His only child, eight-year-old Alexandra-
[ Woman Sighs ]
Sob story.
[ Hughes ] He's not getting the women.
They're going down on it.
-[ Anthony ] Not a handsome child.
-[ T.J.] Why do you think that is?
Well, it's the sympathy compound.
The voters really resent using the family to try to get a sympathy vote.
- [ T.J. ] They're feeling manipulated?
- [ Hughes ] Oh, absolutely.
Bush, for example, when he introduced his family... in that Houston 90-second clip, that was a disaster.
He ended on a low note because of the way he treated his family.
People are tired of that.
People even tune down for Mrs. Dole... because they're getting tired of bringing the family in.
But I haven't seen anything this bad.
- Bob, how are you?
- Hey,Jack.
How you doin'?
- You're killin' 'em.
- You're closing the gap, right?
- I'm hanging on by my fingernails.
- You're doing a great job.
Thanks very much.
But you're really something.
You're really doing it.
Well, we got 'em on the run.
Beating the bushes.
Well, I think it's gonna be you and me in the final stretch, if I can hang in there.
- It's good to see you.
- Good luck, and we'll see you in November.
- Take care.
Bye-bye.
- Pleasure to see you again.
- Nice to see you again.
- Take care.
Bye-bye.
- Come on, kiddo.
- Okay.
Let's go.
They don't feel pain that's not their own.
And yet this is central to the way Americans feel about themselves.
Wait.
Look, it's going back up.
Again, the same shot.
- What do you think they're responding to?
- [ Deke ] Scenes of New Hampshire.
No, they're responding to his face.
He's got a great face.
[ TV:
Tanner] To be stimulated... by the same disputes, even on either side... is to be alike.
Now, in my generation, the, uh... civil rights awakening compelled people to choose sides.
For some of us, not to go to Selma was to be on the wrong side.
- [ Snickers ] - [ Man #1 ] Selma.!
What?
- Selma!
- [ Man #2 ] What is this?
- [ Chattering, Laughing ]
- Hey, Bill, what's Selma?
[ Man #2 ] What's the guy's foreign policy?
Alabama.
He wasn't there.
It doesn't make any difference.
- Any questions?
- Did you march down in Selma?
Oh, yeah.
I certainly did.
It was quite a time.
- [ Woman ] What's Selma?
- "What's Selma"?
- "What's Selma"?
- [ Man #3 ] Hey.!
That's my question.!
- That's right!
- You were ahead of him.
- Hello?
- [ Hughes ] How do you want to approach this?
- Do you want to mark lows and highs?
- Oh, hello, Congressman.
It's Emile Berkoff.
- [ Deke ] I can't believe my work is subjected to this computer.!
- Hi.
How are you?
[ T.J.] Listen,your work is gonna be subjected to more than that.
-Joe. [ Chuckles ]
Where's my cigarettes?
Does anybody have a cigarette?
- T.J. T.J.
- I want a reedit tonight
- What?
- It's Joe again.
- [ Deke ] A reedit?
- Oh.
Great.
Okay.
- She's coming,Joe.
[ Emile ] Okay.
Nice talking to you.
Right.
Bye-bye.
-[ Deke ] Who?
-[ Emile ]Joe Kennedy.
Hi,Joe.
Yeah.
Listen, can I call you back?
I -
-Joe Kennedy's on the phone?
- Yes.
Excuse me, please.
- [ T.J. ] Joe
-Joe -
- That's Bobby Kennedy's son.
Hold on a second, will ya?
Is he sliding or holding steady?
Sliding.
[ Whispers ] Come on, damn it.
Joe, listen, I've got kind of a situation here.
- Okay, uh, why don't we start by-
- So we've gotta talk at another-
Let's just pick out the lows.
- [ Hughes ] She mentioned the highs before.
- Mm-hmm.
- [ Emile ] Then let's pick out the highs.
Fine.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah, I know.
But listen, I don't know that committee.
I don't know any of the people.
I don't know the players.
I don't know how that committee works.
I just can't help you.
I know.
I know.
It's getting to me too.
I -
What?
What?
Where are you calling me from?
A basketball game.
Listen,Joe, why don't you just go ask your uncle?
[ Reporter ] Is it hurting your campaign... that you can't travel the state without running into the other candidates?
Oh, not at all.
I mean, you expect to run into the other candidates.
It's a small state, small towns.
We just ran into Bob Dole here.
He's a lovely guy.
I've known him for years.
I like seeing him, actually.
I don't agree with him for a second, politically, but, uh, that's the game.
We like each other.
There's a collegiality about it all.
Yeah, people get a very skewed view.
I mean, they- they see candidates for the presidency as enemies, and they're not.
I mean, we're, you know - we're all friends... and part of the same community.
There really is no antagonism between personalities.
[ Reporter ] Are you getting the impression... there might be a political career for yourself down the road, 1 0, 1 2 years from now?
I can't think about that right now.
I'm just here to help my dad.
Do not pull that on me.
That was a victory party.
I was drunk, and it was just a figure of speech.
Now -
Okay, I'm hanging up now,Joe.
Do you hear me?
I'm hanging up.
No, I'm not!
No, I'm
- Listen -
[ Sighs ] Bobby, I just don't have time for this.
I'm -
[ Hughes ] We really lost them on that- that point right here.
Did I say that?
- [ Hughes ] Never really recovered.
- [ Sighs ]
- Well...
- I've never seen anything like this...
- that's how tired I am.
- for somebody with no previous TVQ.
It's true.
I don't have a highly structured campaign organization.
- I don't have an army of advance men.
- [ All Laughing ]
I certainly don't have much money.
But what I do have is infinitely more valuable - the currency and power of ideas.

I wanna beat you, but I'd rather have you in there than Kemp.

Good luck to you.
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.
You too.
Senator, if we could get some time before I leave tomorrow, that'd be great.

- It's your individual right
- How many farmers have we got here today?
- To choose the one you want to fight for you - [ Siren Wailing, Horn Blasting ]
Don't forget me on election day!
[ Hughes ] This is symptomatic of... no faith in his ability to control the situation.
He goes in, he's supposedly going to be running the country, but he can't even [ Deke ] No.!
It adds to the realism of the man.
- [ Emile ] Mark it, please.
[ Deke ] People don't understand neorealism... and the predominant theme of a man's struggle against an indifferent society.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[ T.J.] Deke, if I hear you use that phrase "neorealism"one more time... you're gonna be using it outside.
[ Hughes ] Conservatives right now are little better than liberals.
Age group, there's no real split.
When Jack comes in-
[ Emile ] We're doing much better with the women.
Great.
The conservatives are going up, the women are going up.
- Maybe Phyllis Schlafly will vote for him.
- [ Deke ] Who's Phyllis-
[ Men, Women Chattering ]
[ Alex ] Hi.
How are you?
[ Alex ] Do you want a button?
- You gonna do well in school?
- Maybe.

Remember?
- She can always
- Hi.
I'm Jack Tanner.
- Hi.
I'm Alex Tanner.
- [ Man ] Nice to meet you.
- I'm Jack Tanner.
-[ Man ] You too.
Welcome to New Hampshire.
-[ Alex ] Thank you very much.
- I'm gonna go talk to the TV station now.
- Oh, okay.
All right.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Jack Tanner.
How are you?
I'm a Republican, but I thought I'd come down to see what you had to offer as a Democrat.
[ Tanner ] Well, I'm glad you came.
Joe?
Hi.
I just want to come over and thank you for coming out.
I think we're gonna make a lot of noise out here today.
- I'll probablyjust vote for a Republican after all.
- Well, keep an open mind.
[ Chuckles ]
- Have you seen her mother lately,Jack?
- Who?
Alex's mother, Carol.
- Stop that, will ya?
- Stop what?
- [ Microphone Feedback ]
- Hi.
I'm Jack Tanner.
- Testing.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
- Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
- [ Feedback Continues ]
Your friends say that she held you to an incredible high standard... that you could never measure up.
The same situation with your mother.
Similar.
- Who says this?
- Friends.
- About my mother?
- No, Carol!
And to Mrs. Bohanan and Mrs. Melville for all the really great food.
I haven't had any yet, but I can smell it.
It smells wonderful.
Why do you think they tell me things like that?
Hmm?
I don't know why anybody'd ever tell you anything, Hayes.
Every time a candidate takes a leak, you start taking notes.
[ Alex On P.A.] All this snow is very familiar-
Am I
-Am I taking notes?
And I'm here to introduce you to my dad... a very special man and the next president of the United States, Mr.Jack Tanner!
- Oh, by the way, I learned to drink to please my father...
- [ Cheering, Applause ]
- [ Alex ] Dad?
- who I wanted to murder so I could then marry my mother.
- Dad?
- This is true.
Be sure you get it right.
- Quote me correctly, will ya?
- Dad?
Mmm!
I told you to watch out for that New Hampshire beer, Dad, but you didn't listen.
- [ Laughing ] Yes, you did.
- [ Alex Laughing ]
- Jack Tanner, ladies and gentlemen.
- [ Cheering ]
Thank you, Alex.
Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
Sorry I missed my cue, Alex.
I was having such a great time over there.
You know, a few minutes ago...
I looked out over this indescribably beautiful vista... and I said to myself...
"New Hampshire is a rich state."
- [ TV:
Tanner] New Hampshire's on the move.
- [ Woman Scoffs ]
- New Hampshire's accessed the future.
- [ Man Chuckles ]
- New Hampshire knows the future is now.
- [ Woman ] Amazing.
All right, we're coming in to the end here.
What do you think of the overall trend?
Is it still downward or [ Hughes ] I'm afraid it is.
- [ TV:

- [ Andrea ] Yes!
- [ Chattering, Murmuring ]
And this is truly our natural heritage... that we used to take for granted.
[ Snowmobiles Approaching ]
But now we know that these vast, fragile lands... are our most precious legacy.
They replenish the soul... and they soothe-
They replenish our spirit and they soothe our [ Snowmobile Engine Idling ] - they soothe -
Whatever!
[ Chuckles ]
All right, um... at th
- Uh, I'm sorry.
At this time we're going to bring Professor Hughes back into the room.
He's going to help us assess your, uh - the data that we've, uh, culled from your- from your reactions to the film.
- And now here's, uh -
- Fine.
Thanks, Emile.
This has been a very useful session for us.
You've given us a lot of good response, a lot of material to think about...
- a lot of information.
- [ Banging ]
But the most important information doesn't come from the numbers.
It comes from people.
[ Andrea ] Okay, well, let me first help you hand these out.
[ Women, Men Chattering ]
- Pizza!
- [ All Responding Enthusiastically ]
- Okay.
- There you go.
- Take one, pass it back.
- We're trying to explain what's going on -
I know, but they can eat at the same time.
Here you go.
- Pass one back.
- I think they're plain, actually.
-[ Woman ] Oh, my.!
- Be careful.
The bottoms are hot.
He doesn't say anything the whole time that he's talking.
-[ Hughes ] But you liked some aspects of the speech, though.
- That's right.
-[ Hughes ] Okay.
- [ Chattering, Shouting ]
They're all other people's ideas.
He had Kennedy, he had Martin Luther King.
Where's his ideas?
Forget this stuff of associating himself with heroes.
- Well, I -
- It's almost like Biden.
Instead of coming out and just plagiarizing... he puts these old faces around him.
It's the same thing.
He's not saying anything.
He's letting other people speak for him.
He's saying that ideas are his currency.
Well, if that's his currency, then let's see the color of his money.
Aside for anything else, the thing that spurred my gut reaction is... that someone would allow himself, or encourage his publicist... to portray him in such a sentimental manner.
These soulful monologues by the fireside with this soppy music underneath -
- I just
- I don't trust anyone who - - [ Woman ] He's a lovely man.!
That's all he is, as far as I'm concerned.
He's a nice man.
[ Hughes ] And you don't particularly want a lovely man for president?
- No, I have to have a little more substance.
- [ Man ] He's the perfect vice president.
[ Men, Women Laughing ]
What's he want to be president?
What's he running for anyway?
[ Hughes ] What made you say he was looking for a sympathy vote?
Well, he's giving you that old World War II stuff about -
The sob story about his kids [ Chattering Continues ] - [ Andrea ] No, I don't feel that way.!
I'm not
- I
- I disagree.
- I'm from that exact - - [ Man ] Selma?
You're-
I've been to Selma.

- [ Radio:

- [ Hayes ] Will you let me out?
journeyed across the Granite State in search of votes... in the upcoming, first-in-the-nation primary election.
[ Groans ] You take care of your dad.
Okay?
- See ya in the funny papers.
- [ Tanner] Yeah, yeah.
[ Radio:
Announcer Continues ] Bruce Babbitt was in Seabrook... where demonstrations against the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant were scheduled for the noon hour.
JesseJackson was in Concord for a news conference on the statehouse steps.
Jack Tanner and Richard Gephardt are also in the state today.
Both Republicans were in Dartmouth for the-
[ Stringer ] The thing of it is, these people... have seen presidential candidates come through here all their lives.
It's a whole state of Farmer Bobs.
They've been exposed to too many candidates, too many political ads.
[ T.J.] Stringer, what are you saying?
Are you saying the people of New Hampshire are too sophisticated for us?
Are you saying that they're too jaded... for some film collage from an East Village pitch artist?
- What did she say?
- Uh, excuse me.
Mrs. Cavanaugh?
Yeah, Andrea, what is it?
I was wondering if it would be okay for me to come in and sit with you guys for a while.
Because Dr. Hughes left with all those "demographic-ers."
I've been feeling kinda depressed.
You're depressed?
Ye
-Well, not really.
I've been thinking that maybe it's because -
Andrea, it's okay, honey.
Come on in.
Sit down.
Thanks.
I know that Tanner's going to win.
I mean, none of that has changed.
[ T.J.] You can't blame the consumer.
Ask yourself, Stringer... is that guy on the tape the guy you left Shearson Lehman for?
Is that guy running through the snow to answer his telephone... the next leader of the free world?
T.J., all I'm saying is, it could be the process itself.
For the voters it's long, it's tedious, it's numbing.
What they may be resisting is the whole idea of another candidacy.
- Ohh.
- No.
No.
I'm sorry, but I disagree.
That is not what the people in the next room have told us.
Quite the reverse.
More than ever, people want a leader that they can believe in.
Ninety-one percent of Americans... believe that this is the best place on the planet.
- [ Softly ] Sure.
I do.
- [ Emile ] That gives people a sense of entitlement.
The best demand the best.
God, more than ever people want a leader who can lift them up... someone who can... cast a spell... who can throw a bold message into high relief with peerless grace... someone who can lead without intimidation... who can command without rancor.
They want a
-They want a -
A whiteJesseJackson.
[ Emile Laughing ] Yes.
Or a - a - a black Bruce Babbitt.

- Dad?
- Mm-hmm?
- Do you like him?
- Who?
- Taggerty.
When do you have to be back at school, honey?
- I don't.
- What do you mean, you don't?
I don't have to be back at school.
I'm taking the semester off.
Oh, that's great, Lexy.
You mean you dropped out so you could hang around a hotel -
I talked to the dean.
It's perfectly fine.
It's crazy, is what it is.
I may not even be a candidate after 48 hours!
- Then in 48 hours I'll be back at school.
- Oh, honey-
Dad, if you make it and I had nothing to do with it, I'd never forgive myself.
And if you don't make it... well, I have to be there.
No,you don't.
That's the point.
T.J. said she can use me advancing... and if I could really get my act together I could stand in for you sometimes, maybe.
- Your mother's gonna -
- Mom will get over it.
No, she won't.
She'll find me.
She'll hunt me down.
She'll reopen the custody battle.
She'll string me up.
- Daddy!
Hello.
- She'll cut me open.
I've been there before.
- I'm 1 9.
- Yeah.
[ Radio:

[ Men Chanting ] It's time to work the vote.!
George Bush ain't got no stones.!
Al Haig kicks ass!
His balls are brass!
It's time to work the vote!
[ Alex ] I have to tell you, those are the Haig volunteers.
- [ Chanting Continues ]
- They roam through the halls all hours of the day and night screaming -
- Hi, guys.
- Al Haig kicks ass!
His balls are brass!
- See if you can stay away from 'em.
- Oh, I'll try real hard.
But they're just so charming and drunken.
Haig supporters have all the fun [ Alex ] Life is very fun in the hotel.
- Oh.
Okay, you got a reception in the Versailles Room at 7:1 5.
- Okay, okay, okay.
I'll be there.
- Don't be late.
- [ Kiss ]
- Bye-bye.
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.
- I've already seen nine people I know.
- The price of fame, my dear.
We're in 204.
Last one there pays for the Magic Fingers.
[ Woman ] I'm gonna have to get out myJane Fonda tape,you realize.
-[ Man ] Ain't you Tanner?
- Yeah, hi.Jack Tanner.
- We just saw a movie of you on TV.
- Really?
Did you like it?
You said something about accessing the future.
- Mr. Tanner!
Hi!
Betsy Trammell.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's important.
Hi, Betsy.
[ Woman ] May I have your autograph, please?
- [ Tanner] Yeah, I feel strongly that - - [ All Chattering, Shouting ]
- We don't know what you stand for.
- [ Chattering, Shouting Continues ]
[ Stringer ] Sorry, folks.
We're gonna have to leave you.
We've got radio interviews in 1 0 minutes.
Sorry.
- We got radio interviews to go to, folks.
- I do want to talk to you about this.
- Question -
- I know.
It's a question of time.
- Hi.
Nice to see you.
- Mr. Tanner!
- [ Chattering, Shouting Continues ] - [ Tanner ] Excuse us.
[ Stringer] That was the focus group we just finished.
[ Tanner] Yeah?
How'd we do?
- I think we're gonna surprise a lot of people.
- Yeah?
Well, surprise me first.
No.Joe, I'm sorry.
It's not a good time to talk.
Don't you have anybody else you can discuss this with?
- I'm not turning on you!
- [ Andrea ] Hi.
Mr. Delduca?
This is Andrea Spinelli.
I got your name from Mark Atreo.
He said you might be interested in doing some volunteer work... for thejack Tanner campaign.
Yeah.
Are you still interested?
That's great, 'cause we need as many people right now as we can get.
[ T.J.] What is it with your family?
You Kennedys always take it personally... whenever somebody wants to get back involved with their own life.
-[ Andrea ] If you could come down sometime this afternoon-
- It's not -
[ T.J. ] No.
I'm s
-Well, I'm s
-What?
[ Andrea ] Oh.
Well, I'm sorry you're disappointed with Congress,Joe.
So quit.
- Heavy mantle, my ass!
- But since I have you on the phone -
You're starting to sound like Prince Charles.
Well, I don't know.
I just
- How -
Okay.
Okay,Joe.
Vote "yes."
Vote "yes."
Okay, then vote "no."
I don't know what to tell you.
I c -
I-I gotta go.
U-Um, yeah.
No, I gotta go right now.
Okay.
Good-bye.
Good-bye!
Trouble in Camelot?
That's the third time he's called today.
[ Tanner Sighs ] Well, tell me you had a better day than I did.
[ T.J.] I can't.
[ T.J.] The group didn't get it.
[ Tanner] What?
[ T.J. ] Any of it.
Why you're running.
The point of your candidacy.
They didn't get it, and neither did -
[ Tanner ] Yeah.
And you're not so sure you get it either, right?
Ehh.
I'm tired.
Yeah, so am I.
You know, T.J.,just before you called me last spring...
Lexy and I went down to the Democratic leadership conference in South Carolina.
The last night we were sitting around with Kirk O'Donnell and...
Hart, Biden... a couple of the other candidates.
We were shooting the breeze about how much the party had changed... since the '60s.
Suddenly, out of the blue...
Lexy turned to Hart and she asked him who his favorite Beatle was.
At first Hart laughed.
Then he stumbled around trying to remember a name.
Then she repeated her question for Biden, and Biden said... well, he'd never been a Beatles fan, he was into jazz.
And Dukakis answered, "Paul. "
'Cause he liked his wife or something.
Now, I don't know if Lexy knows the names of all the Beatles herself... let alone the answer to her own question... but it suddenly dawned on me... that I sure as hell did.
And I knew for sure that anybody who didn't... had absolutely no claim to generational leadership.
Now, I must have, what, uh, 1 0 years on Joe Biden... but, damn it, he wasn't paying attention back then, and I was.
And one of the things I figured out very early on was the singer mattered as much as the song... that ideas were only as valuable as the people who got behind them.
I mean, people that wouldn't settle... people unafraid of honest inquiry... people who didn't mind asking...
- [ Bangs On Table ] - the impertinent question!
[ Sighs ]
God, the impertinent question.
Where the hell would we be without it?
It's the glory and the engine of all human experience.
Copernicus asked it.
Shook the foundations of his world.
Darwin asked it.
He's repudiated to this day.
Thomas Jefferson asked it.
He was so invigorated by it... he declared it to be an inalienable right.
I'm not smart enough to know all the answers... but I do know... we've got to keep asking the questions.
That's what the American experiment is all about.
It's at the very core of our character as a people.
We owe our vigor to its constant renewal.
You know, I don't have much patience for these guys who go around saying... the pride is back in America.
For some of us, it never left.
Vietnam may have covered some patriots in shame... but not this one.
We got in there for moral reasons... and, by God, we got out of there for moral reasons!
Where else on this earth does such debate center on anything other than expediency?
Only in America.
Watergate.
Triumph of the system.
How could anybody watch Barbara Jordan... thunder away at those House hearings... and not feel a surge of pride in the miracle of this country?
Now, there are those people who tell you that our... noisy dissent, our raucous squabble... weakened us as a country, caused us to lose our supremacy.
Don't you believe it.
We are the envy of this world.
Why?
Because throughout our history... we have always maintained... that we could do better.
We've insisted that we could do better!
We've always been willing to reinvent ourselves for the common good.
And in our darkest hour... leaders - real leaders... have always stepped forward... to hold the American people... to the responsibility of citizenship!
Well, it's time for that kind of leadership now, T.J.
And I'm not sure that it's me... but I'd like the chance to find out.
Oh, and if you young people are still wondering... the right answer's John Lennon.
Did you get it?
I got it.
[ Click ]
Oh!
What?
Following their successful invasion of the Soviet Union there's an increased deployment of German troops to the Eastern front.
The so-called Resistance groups received another blow yesterday.
Three terrorists were shot dead...
Good morning, Monsieur Chavel.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
The train from Paris is arriving at 08:35.
We apologise for the delay.
The train will be leaving from platform seven.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Monsieur Chavez.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
The new German financial regulations, monsieur.
Jules.
Check, please.
Right away, Monsieur Chavel.
- We need one more.
- We need one more!
Why me?
I'm a lawyer.
Let me go!
Who's in charge?
Let me go!
It's a mistake.
I'm an ordinary man.
Come on.
And you.
Forwards!
Move it!
Come on!
Come on!
Out!
Do as you're told, come on.
Where are we?
This is ridiculous.
There's been some mistake.
Who's in charge?
Come on, you!
Forwards when I tell you!
There's been some mistake.
I'm a lawyer.
I want to see someone in charge.
I demand to speak to that officer.
Ah!
Quickly, quickly.
In you go.
And you.
Hey, Breton, what time is it?
- 8:50.
- 40.
It's 8:40.
It's pretty, your antique, but it doesn't keep good time any more.
It's 8:40.
You should know that a piece of rubbish from a market stall is bound to slow down.
It's not made to last.
8:50.
Ran into some trouble?
Yes.
Who...
Who's in charge?
I need to talk to someone.
- Save your breath.
- I've done nothing.
- There's no reason for me to be here.
- No reason for any of us.
What's the matter?
Don't tell me you don't know what's going on.
Every now and then they run out and grab a few people off the street.
Then they keep us in cold storage...
till needed.
Very simple.
Any resistance, sabotage, trouble... the Germans shoot a few hostages to restore law and order.
Then they round up a few more.
They think it works quite well.
- There must be some way.
- Let's see.
Do you know anyone useful?
- Hauptführer?
- No.
Even a colonel could help.
Nothing going on?
So far.
This is where they do it.
They march down the yard, and round the back.
And then you hear the shots.
You and I must be the only professional men in here.
Lorry driver, shop assistant, tobacconist...
labourers.
Michel Mangeot calls himself a clerk but was unemployed when they picked him up.
I myself was mayor of Bouges but I don't think the three-coloured sash would look its best with this.
There must be something we can do, even here.
The law exists to protect the innocent.
My son wouldn't agree with you.
He believes money pressed into the right palm always does the trick.
Everyone back inside!
Time for slops.
Stop!
If only I could let someone know, make contact.
My son probably thinks I'm dead.
He'll have sold the family silver.
Move on.
Stop!
The local shooting gallery.
You ever kill a man?
No.
No, I've never killed anyone.
I've never faced a man with a gun either.
Move on!
OK.
Are you ready for this?
Your socks.
Raise you two buttons and a shoelace.
I'm in for two cigarettes.
Two cigarettes...
and I'll raise you my waistcoat.
- I see that.
- Full house.
Threes and nines.
I'm finished.
I'm hanging on to my trousers.
Me too.
Four tens.
I win.
It seems calm.
Generally is.
Early on.
- Were you here when they shot the others?
- Yes.
They do it in the morning.
Seven o'clock.
- You saw the place?
- Oh, yes.
Wooden posts and a...
a stone wall.
It's not much of a wall now.
Bullet holes all over it.
Terrible.
All chipped.
They must be lousy shots.
Good enough, though.
I've never really been out of Paris.
Fontainebleau.
I went there one summer.
For the day.
With my mother and my sister.
It was nice.
I'd like to have travelled a bit.
- I suppose you've been all over.
- Mm?
No, not really.
Just in the army, but I didn't get further than the barracks at Marseille.
They wouldn't take me.
I don't want to go anywhere again.
Just to St Jean de Brinac, my home.
It's about...
It's just...
about an hour outside Paris.
Nice place, is it?
I bet you've got a real mansion.
Mm.
Funny old place, really.
The staircase.
I could do you a drawing with this pen if you like.
Don't.
It's your house, not mine.
My father owned it, like his father before him.
I may retire there one day.
What was your father's job?
He was a lawyer, like his father before him.
I suppose it's all right.
Seems a bit dusty to me.
Oh...
You can rely on the law.
It's not like family or friends.
The law never lets you down.
Unless you're on the wrong side of it.
I thought you said it was too early for trouble.
Come with me!
Come with me!
Move!
What time is it?
Half past six.
- I thought it was later.
- It is.
It's twenty to seven.
Your piece of junk is fast.
Look out!
I have an announcement.
Outrages were committed in the city last night.
The second-in-command to the military governor was murdered.
Also, a girl on a bicycle.
We do not complain about the girl.
Frenchmen have our permission to kill Frenchwomen if they wish to.
Do not blame us for the consequences.
Blame your own so-called Resistance.
My orders are... that in this prison, one man in every ten... is to be shot.
You are 30.
Your contribution then is... three.
We are quite indifferent as to which three.
This time... choose for yourselves.
The execution will take place at seven tomorrow morning.
Well, what do we do?
Volunteer?
We could draw lots.
Unless it's felt we should go by age, oldest first.
That wouldn't be right.
We've lived our life.
It's the way of nature.
Not always.
We'll draw lots.
Surely that's the fairest way.
How do we do it?
Flip a coin?
We can't get an even chance with a coin.
The only way's a draw.
You can use this letter.
The backs are blank.
But why three lives for one?
It's not fair.
I don't go along with it!
We... we must demand to see a superior officer.
That's no good.
You can see the marked ones.
We need a shoe to put them in.
Krogh's got the biggest feet.
- Who's going first?
- Alphabetical order.
- Going backwards.
- You would say that.
For God's sake, do we have to squabble over this?
OK...
Nobody here before V?
Nobody?
OK.
Here goes.
That's it.
Tough luck on Voisin, but it's improved the odds.
All right, who's next?
U, T, S...?
The hell with this!
We've all got to take a slip.
Let's get on with it.
Two.
- Ha!
- Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight...
Nine...
Who's the tenth man?
Mangeot, you next.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Thirteen...
Fourteen.
Fifteen...
Sixteen.
Seventeen...
Eighteen.
Nineteen...
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two...
- May I join you?
- Twenty-three...
Twenty-four...
Twenty-five, twenty-six...
Twenty-seven...
- You looked!
- I did not look!
He didn't.
Come and sit with us, Monsieur Chavel.
I didn't agree to this draw.
Come and sit down.
You can't do anything about it.
But why...?
- I'm an innocent man.
- Look at it this way.
If it's not now, it's another time.
None of us live forever.
You can't make me do this!
It's not up to us, is it?
You can't make me do this!
I'll give 100,000 francs to anyone... who'll take this.
100,000 francs.
Please.
100,000.
Please, 100,000 francs!
I'll give 100,000 francs.
Please!
No one's going to give his life for money he'll never enjoy.
It's obvious.
I'll give you everything I've got.
Everything.
My land, my house, everything.
Please.
- Nobody wants to die.
- Rich or poor.
So just shut up!
Tell me more.
Maybe I'll take your offer.
100,000 francs, my land, my house, everything I've got.
- How rich are you?
- Don't laugh at him.
I'm not laughing, I'm doing a deal.
You'll take my place?
- I'll take your place.
- What use is his money when you're dead?
I have a mother and a sister.
I can make a will.
I don't like this.
We can't buy our lives.
Why should he?
If you've got money, you can do what you like.
Buy another man's life?
Why not?
- It's not fair.
- Why isn't it fair to let me do what I want?
I'm going to die a rich man.
Anyone who thinks it isn't fair can rot in hell.
Come here.
Sit down.
How much money is there?
300,000 francs, approximately.
- Approximately?
- Yes.
Well.
And the place?
- The orchards, the farmland, the house...
- What about Paris?
The office is rented.
- Any family?
- No, none.
Right.
You're a lawyer.
You better draw everything up properly.
Make me out a...
what's it called?
- Deed of gift.
- That's right.
Make it out to me.
Michel Mangeot.
Michel...
Mangeot.
"I, Jean-Louis Chavel...
"of St Jean de Brinac...
"give all stocks and shares, all money to account
"and all furniture...
"and contents of St Jean de Brinac
"and the freehold of said property... "
I need, er, two witnesses.
No, not you.
I want living men as witnesses.
Perhaps you could.
There's my pen.
- It's a very odd document.
- Give it here.
I'll sign.
Better have somebody respectable if this is to be taken seriously.
Right.
Now my will.
To my mother and sister equally.
I want something to show the neighbours what sort of man I was.
You keep the documents.
They'll let you send them off when they've finished.
I'm a rich man.
Always knew I'd be rich one day.
Chavel...
Tell me about my house.
It's about a mile outside the village.
How many rooms?
There is the drawing room, the dining room, six bedrooms, my study...
a kitchen...
- Tell me about the kitchen.
- The housekeeper didn't complain.
Where's she?
I don't know.
Maybe she left, shut everything up.
Garden?
Oh, yes, there's a fountain and some roses.
- Can I grow vegetables?
- Oh, yes.
Some fruit... apples and plums, and there's... there's a beautiful walnut tree.
Walnut tree.
Yes.
How old's the house?
It was built in 1780.
Pity.
My mother has trouble with her lungs.
I'd have liked something modern.
Lights out!
Mangeot... it's no good.
I must have been out of my mind.
We'll call it off.
Look, I don't want this any more.
Waiting in line for the bucket latrine, eating slops, coughing my guts up day after day.
Then, if I'm lucky, back on the streets.
I'm going out in style.
Your style.
Mangeot, listen to me.
I won't let you do it.
I don't want to die, God knows, I don't want to die.
But I can't.
You've got a family.
Yes.
And in my family, when we say we're going to do something, we do it.
It's too late.
We did a deal.
What time is it?
- Six minutes to seven.
- Four minutes past.
Come on!
Ready?
Aim!
Fire!
What do you want?
You won't find anyone there.
They closed down years ago.
It's a nice ring.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Why does every passing tramp have to ring this bell?
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
- You need food?
- I don't want much.
I haven't much in the house.
Where are you from?
I was in Paris, but there's no work, so I thought I'd head south.
- Don't bring in dirt.
I've scrubbed that step.
- I'll take my shoes off.
There's some food in the kitchen.
Which...
which way do I go?
Where's...?
Where's what?
Your mother.
Er...
Where's your mother?
- How do you know about my mother?
- Your brother told me.
- You knew Michel?
- Yes.
When?
Were you with him in prison?
Yes.
Terese!
- Mother doesn't know.
- About his death?
The other business.
She thinks he made a fortune.
- What's your name?
- Jean Perrette.
Did you know the other one?
Oh, yes, I knew him.
- Who is this?
- Somebody who knew Michel.
- You knew Michel?
- Yes.
He said I should look you up if...
Well, we all said that kind of thing.
He was a wonderful boy.
He bought all this for his old mother.
Silly boy.
I was OK where I was.
We had three nice little rooms in Clichy.
Cosy.
Here, we're cut off from the world.
It's too much for an old woman.
I thought he'd left enough so you'd be comfortable.
There's things money can't buy.
He's hungry.
Well, give him some food.
If he wants food, he should ask.
You'd think he was a beggar.
I'm not begging.
I can pay for food.
I have a few francs.
Shouldn't be so free with your money.
It won't get you anywhere.
Look at those socks!
There's some bread and cheese.
- Tell me about him.
- Michel?
Everybody liked him.
I didn't mean Michel.
I mean the other one, Chavel.
I looked at that name on the documents.
Jean-Louis Chavel.
I've got a feeling he'll be back.
He won't be able to resist seeing what's happened to his beautiful house.
We're always getting strangers at the door, hungry, looking for a meal.
But every time that bell starts to jangle I think to myself,
"Maybe this time that's him. "
- And if it was?
- I'd spit in his face.
That's the first thing I'd do.
And then I'd kill him.
If it wasn't for her, I'd set light to the place.
What a fool Michel was.
Did he really think I'd rather have this than him?
Half of me's dead.
The night they shot him, I felt the pain.
I sat up in bed and I felt this pain.
It wasn't at night, it was in the morning.
- Not in the night?
- No.
What did it mean, that pain I felt that night?
Nothing.
It's often the way.
We think there's a meaning, then we find the facts are wrong.
You wake up with a pain and you think that... but things don't fit.
Tell me what Chavel looks like.
He was just an ordinary man, like the rest of us.
- Ordinary?
- Yes...
We are taught to forgive our enemies.
I can't forgive him.
And one day, I know I'll see his face.
- I think I should be going.
- Where are you going?
What did you do before?
I was in the civil service.
Nothing special.
Ministry of education.
- Don't you have any family?
- No.
We could do with some help.
This place takes a lot of cleaning.
- And there's the garden.
- I don't...
Beneath you, is it?
No.
There wouldn't be any problem with wages.
We're rich.
Yes, I think I could stay for a while.
I'll get you some socks.
He won't miss them.
There's plenty to do, as you can see, but the main thing I'll be paying you for is to keep an eye out for him.
I don't know what he looks like.
You do.
You can sleep in here.
This is the maid's room.
I suppose so.
Not much of a room, is it?
You should see his.
I can't bear to go in there.
- It's only a room.
- It's full of him.
The smell of his cologne, the polish of his fine shoes.
There's a bowl of potpourri on the chest.
I wonder who put that there.
His mother... probably.
What are you doing?
I nearly fell over it.
I thought I'd clean it up.
It's a dust trap, all that fancy carving.
Still, it's a nice frame.
Maybe you'd like to hang it somewhere.
- Would you like that?
- Why not?
Erm...
Here.
Is this where it went?
Very good.
Yes, that's where it went.
I'm going to market tomorrow.
Anything you want?
A razor?
Shave that beard off, see what you look like.
No, I like my beard.
You ought to hire a cart from the village.
It's a long walk, carrying all that.
I can't ask them in the village.
That's his territory.
- He never had much to do with them.
- How do you know?
I heard him telling your brother.
He said the people here never felt at ease with him.
I'm not surprised.
Or maybe he said he never had much to do with them.
You see, as he grew up, he grew away from them.
Or so he said.
They seem to have talked a good deal.
Yes.
I think Michel felt he was living his whole life that night.
"Tell me about my house," he said, "my garden. "
- Why are you bothering with the bushes?
- They're raspberries and redcurrants.
They're almost ripe.
It's crazy buying all that stuff from the market.
If we clear this garden, we could... you could grow all you need.
Making yourself at home, aren't you?
Sitting here.
Stuck in the kitchen.
What's the point of being rich?
We should have real servants.
Not tramps who come in off the road.
Does it need salt?
No, it's fine.
Stuck!
- Can't even get to Mass.
- Why?
It's too far.
Even climbing the stairs is like climbing a mountain for me some days.
Once... on the 14th of July...
I was dancing in the streets.
I danced all night.
Eight o'clock, we opened up the shop and I worked in it all day and I didn't even feel tired.
Your father used to say that I was like a butterfly.
Butterfly.
We could help you.
You could lean on us.
We'll see.
Don't you want to go in?
I've got nothing to say to God any more.
Mother wanted to know why I didn't go to church any more.
Told her I'd lost my faith.
But it's the hate that keeps me away.
I can't drop my hate at the church door and pick it up an hour later on the way out.
It goes on and on.
All day and all night.
It's all there is.
Couldn't you try going out once in a while?
See something new.
People like us don't do that sort of thing.
We did go to Fontainebleau once, with Michel.
That was a lovely day.
Mother likes to pretend but we were as poor as hell.
Chavel made a good living.
He must be a hard, calculating sort of person.
Why do you say that?
You don't become a rich lawyer by accident.
You know he inherited that law practice?
All he ever wanted to do was hurry back to his house and garden.
Just like a failure, afraid of...
being found out.
You sound as though you hate him too.
Hm?
No.
No, I despise him, just for what he did.
Hey, let's go here.
This way.
His parents.
Both died the same year.
Where did you get those?
They make you look like an old man.
I found them in the market.
I won't be fobbed off with rotten food now.
I can see what I'm doing.
It was a bit thin in the market this morning.
Thought we could get a rabbit or something.
Here's your change.
And the list.
You'd better check it.
- I trust you.
- Your mother doesn't.
Here.
That's strange.
Your writing looks familiar.
It's very ordinary writing.
Quite characterless.
Strange.
It's like that feeling you get when you think you've been somewhere before.
Oh, well.
Could you put the change in the drawer?
I'm sorry, I...
I couldn't sleep so I came down to get myself some water.
I thought I heard a noise, a bird falling down the chimney.
- Maybe it was a rat.
- No rat's been here for three years.
Why don't you clear all this stuff out?
I couldn't bear to touch it.
But have anything you like if it fits you.
Silly to leave it rotting here.
Poor thing.
Imagine being the mother of a monster like that.
You know, there was a point that night when he tried to call it off.
He didn't want to go through with it.
- But your brother refused.
- Once.
- He really tried.
- He acted the coward, I agree.
But anyone can play the coward once.
Many of us do, in fact, and you forget about it afterwards.
It's just that in his case, it was so... spectacular.
You mean he was unlucky.
Everyone's tested at some point.
It can happen any time.
And then you discover what you've been all your life, what you are.
Do you know what you are, really?
No.
But I will one day.
And I know what he is.
He's a murderer.
All I want is him in front of me, and me with a gun.
I suppose afterwards you'll go to confession and you'll feel happy again.
No.
But perhaps I wouldn't feel so tired.
And old.
And afraid of people.
I could start living.
Can I get you some water?
There's no need for that.
I can't sleep anyway.
Are you tired?
- Want a lift?
- No, thank you.
You're Mademoiselle Mangeot, aren't you?
My name is Roche.
This is Monsieur Perrette.
- I've seen you in the market.
- He's helping us.
You want to be careful.
There's a lot of strangers, funny people.
He's a friend.
You haven't got much to say.
Maybe I should look at your papers.
You sound like a policeman.
It's my business to keep an eye on things, from Resistance days.
- The war's over.
- Don't you believe it.
It's just beginning.
Collaborators creeping out from their little nests.
He was locked up by the Germans and knew my brother.
- And you knew Chavel?
- Yes.
- You two must have been friends.
- When we were kids.
Later, well, he was from the big house.
My family are just farmers.
- What was he like?
- Kept himself to himself.
Afraid of the girls, scared of taking risks.
Why don't they like us in the village?
It's just that they didn't believe your story.
They couldn't believe a man would die for money.
They thought the Germans must be mixed up in it.
He did it for you, of course.
You won't have any more trouble.
I'll have a word.
We're having a celebration on Sunday.
Start of the hunting season.
There'll be dancing.
Come along.
Maybe.
Go on.
- Would you like an aperitif?
- Oh, no.
Didn't do that in Paris.
Couldn't afford to.
A glass of wine.
I can afford it.
I'm paid a fair wage now.
Oh!
Thank you.
It's really strange, sitting here like a lady of leisure.
Do you ever think about the future, what you'll do?
I mean, er...
You'll want to get married one day.
There's not much to choose from round here.
There's Roche, the great Resistance hero.
- And then there's you, of course.
- Ah, yes.
No.
You'll be off, back to your own sort.
Find a job and a girl who works in the civil service.
- Knows about things.
- I'd like to stay here.
Maybe we should go to that dance Roche mentioned.
I'm not too keen on those things.
You go.
I wouldn't go on my own.
But it would have been nice.
She's gone to bed.
They seemed friendly.
Maybe they don't hate us.
Of course they don't hate you.
Well, good night.
You don't have to use the back stairs.
You're not a servant.
- Terese?
Is that you?
- Yes.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I think we should eat in the dining room tonight.
There's no need to behave like Gypsies.
It's our house.
- It'll need cleaning out.
- I'll do it.
Ah, yes.
I'll get some water.
Look.
His whole life's in here.
Him in his cradle.
The christening.
That old priest's still in the village.
And here... is Jean-Louis at his first communion.
That priest again.
He called on us, let us know Chavel used to have him for dinner at Christmas.
Mother let him know there wouldn't be any more grand dinners.
What a bunch.
Mean.
Hard eyes.
No wonder he turned out the way he did.
Can you imagine them doing something human, like dancing or kissing?
Can you imagine them in love?
- How would they show love?
- I suppose they... expressed it just like you... and me.
I suppose that's your admirer Roche, come to pay his respects.
Open up, or Mother will start yelling.
Yes.
- Who is it?
- Jean-Louis Chavel.
- Who?
- Chavel.
Open the door.
It's wet out here.
Who is it?
Chavel.
- I'm sorry, can't you hear me?
- He says it's Jean-Louis Chavel.
Please.
Let him in.
Eh?
I apologise for breaking in on you like this.
- What do you want?
- Shelter.
Something to eat.
You're Chavel?
Jean-Louis Chavel?
Yes, I'm Chavel.
I knew you'd come one day.
I hope you'll allow me to...
Oh!
Erm...
I think you'd better go.
I can't.
They're looking for me.
Young men with guns who call themselves the Resistance.
- Why?
- This is a great time for settling scores.
Anyone who has an enemy can find himself labelled a collaborator.
But you have the perfect answer.
You were in a German prison, condemned to death.
They're saying that I was put there as an informer.
It was wrong of me to come here but a hunted animal heads for the place it knows as home.
I'm sorry.
I'll leave.
Yes.
You'd better go.
I had another reason for coming.
I had a message for Mademoiselle Mangeot.
From her brother.
Message?
I'm sorry, monsieur, you are...?
You should know.
You were in the same prison.
I'm Jean Perrette.
Of course.
I thought I recognised your face.
Is this Chavel?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
It's Chavel.
I shouldn't have come back.
I'm...
Please forgive this intrusion.
Forgive.
You have a message from my brother?
He wanted you to know that he loved you.
He thought this was the best thing he could do for you.
I'm sorry, mademoiselle, I should have realised.
I should have known that this door would no longer be open to me.
You don't have to go.
I wouldn't turn a dog out in this rain.
You can stay.
- It's not long till morning.
- You're very kind.
You need dry clothes.
You'll find everything in your room, as you left it.
I wouldn't presume!
It's not my room any more.
Please.
Who's there?
What's all this noise?
My mother's not well.
I won't tell her who you are, she couldn't take the shock.
Who's this?
Someone who knew Michel.
Another one wanting a free meal.
And a hand-out.
I wonder that my son managed to hold on to any of his money at all.
I said he could stay tonight.
What's your name?
Er, Toupard, Madame.
Philippe Toupard.
- You knew my son?
- Yes, he talked about you a lot.
You must be very proud of him.
I'm starving.
Can you come with me, monsieur?
We have a lot to talk about.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Look, I don't know what's going on here.
All I want is... a night's shelter.
No trouble.
I was on my way to Switzerland.
I got myself into something, er, rather messy, involving the police.
I thought it wise to lie low for a couple of days.
May I see your watch a moment?
A man in prison had a watch like this.
His name was...
- Breton.
- You're the son he talked about.
I had to pull quite a few strings, use friends in high places to get him out.
You think he'd be grateful.
When he found out... he threatened to kick me out of the house.
Called me a collaborator.
Then he had a heart attack.
- What brought you here?
- Well, I remembered the story.
He'd told us about a man in prison with him, who bought his life.
You know, you were there.
I thought it was worth a try.
Jean?
!
Can you help me?
Mother's not well.
She's having her soup in her room.
Monsieur Chavel.
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of it.
You found everything?
In perfect order.
Fresh, dry clothes.
I am deeply grateful.
You're from Paris, yourself, Mademoiselle Mangeot, isn't that right?
My parents are from Normandy but we were born in Paris... my brother and I.
I've forgotten the bread.
You think you can get away with this?
I reckoned Chavel wouldn't have the nerve to come home.
I... decided to do it for him.
Everyone in the village will know you're not Chavel.
I had to risk it, just for the night.
I must say, I like the man's style.
Mm.
It's the best soup I've ever tasted.
All right, what's going on?
What's your game and why are you going along with my story?
To help her.
She had it in her head Chavel would show up one day.
He became an obsession with her.
I thought this would cure it.
She could, er, start living.
Hm.
Well, I think I was a bit hasty, saying I'd leave in the morning.
- I caught a look in her eye.
- You're forgetting she hates Chavel.
But I'm not Chavel.
Not the real Chavel.
I'm the Chavel she's invented for herself, not the dull reality.
- She spat in your face.
- I saw a play in Paris once, by Shakespeare, where the same thing happened.
A king murdered some woman's husband and he was practically lifting her skirt.
The actor wiped his face with his sleeve.
I remember the way he did it.
- Worked rather well.
- You should've been an actor.
When you're living off your wits, you learn to be different things to different people.
Perhaps I could learn to be Jean-Louis Chavel.
You won't get the chance.
You'll be gone by sunrise.
I'll make you.
- All this must be rather a blow to you.
- What do you mean?
Anyone with half an eye can see you're in love with her.
- You must be mad.
- No, it's perfectly reasonable.
I mean, here you are, a man who's been locked up in prison for three years.
You suddenly find yourself with a young girl.
Pretty enough, but... not quite your class.
It must be like being shipwrecked on a desert island.
You should have got in there, made a play for her tonight.
Didn't you sense the emotion that was in the air?
Thanks to me.
God, I'm tired, so tired.
Will you turn out the light, please?
Mother had an attack in the night.
She's very bad.
- Why didn't you call me?
- It wouldn't have helped.
She wants the priest.
I said everyone was tested sooner or later, everyone.
And then you know what you are.
I am a coward, just like him.
We're one of a kind.
When it came to it, I didn't pass the test either.
- Why are you tormenting yourself?
- I should have shot him.
I said I would.
You can't give a man shelter, walk away, find a gun...
- then shoot him in cold blood.
- Why not?
He did to Michel as good as.
Er, you needn't think about Chavel any longer.
He's gone.
- When?
- Earlier this morning.
I would have expected...
You told him to go.
Michel's really dead now.
Terese.
You've been so kind to me.
To us.
So understanding.
I couldn't have managed on my own.
Could you fetch the priest?
Yes, of course.
I wonder where Chavel will go?
Switzerland, probably.
When I went into Mother, she was frightened.
She wanted me to pray for her.
I knelt there, mumbling all that stuff about forgiveness of sins.
I felt terrible.
You didn't seem so anxious to forgive him before you saw him.
It's not so easy to hate a face you know as a face you imagine.
I'll fetch the priest.
I'll take the short cut over the field.
Yes?
Who is it?
What is it?
Sorry to trouble you, Father.
It's Madame Mangeot.
Oh, yes.
I was expecting something of the kind.
- It's heart trouble, I suppose?
- Yes, her daughter asked me...
Is it raining outside?
- No, it's not.
- Good.
That's good.
That's good.
Can I take that, Father?
She's breathing a little easier now.
Thank you, Father.
Send for me if you need me.
I'll go to the market.
I'll be back as quick as I can.
I'm sorry to break in on you again.
I got as far as the village and I heard about your mother.
I'm so very sorry.
- I hope it wasn't me.
- She knows nothing of you.
Oh, good.
I wouldn't want to add to her troubles.
We talked about her, that night.
The night your brother died.
The night?
- He died in the night?
- Yes, of course.
In the night.
- But Jean said he died in the morning.
- I'm afraid he was lying.
Why would he lie about that?
Why?
To make me look worse than I am, I suppose.
I mean, it is worse to let a man die after a whole night to think about it.
Yes.
He said you tried once to call it off.
Yes.
I didn't have another chance.
- They took him away.
- I knew it was in the night.
I woke suddenly with a pain.
- Why did he say that...?
- You don't know this man.
He's a liar, and a cheat.
But you bought your life.
There are so many things you don't understand.
- Your brother was a sick man.
- I know.
He loved you very much.
He worried about what would happen to you, the money, Germans...
We talked about that.
He showed me your photograph.
He didn't have a photograph of me.
But he...
Oh, I know, it was a picture torn out of a newspaper.
Er, a street scene.
A beautiful girl, half-hidden in the crowd.
I suppose it reminded him of you.
People do funny things in prison.
Then, he... asked me what I would give for his blank slip.
What?
- He asked you?
- I know I'm a coward.
I took his offer.
If I'd been guilty of worse than that, do you think I would have dared to come back?
I don't expect you to believe me.
Why should you?
Goodbye and God bless.
There is just one thing that I think you should know.
- Thought you'd left.
- I decided to stay.
I had a long talk with the girl.
Gave her my version of what happened that night.
It's terribly unfair.
But that's life, isn't it?
She's very angry.
She wants you to clear out.
- She's letting you stay?
- She hadn't any choice.
I told her about the decree of the 17th of August.
She hadn't heard about it.
You haven't either, have you?
It makes illegal all changes of property under the German occupation if one party disputes the deal.
It's true.
I'm not making it up.
So as far as she's concerned, the place is mine.
You can't make use of it.
You're on the run, a collaborator, wanted for murder.
Ah, yes, you saw the posters.
I'll just have to lie low until it's safe to push on to Switzerland.
Things will quieten down.
Even a day's shelter is a help in my situation.
Or a week.
Anyway, it's time you left.
- You think I'll say nothing?
- I would advise you not to.
I wouldn't want the girl hurt and as you so very rightly say, I'm already wanted for murder, so I've nothing to lose.
Do you think Chavel will show up?
Is he the type?
Probably he's on his way here now.
Well, if the worst comes to the worst, I've got the gun, haven't I?
Yes, I've got the gun.
So don't get any... clever ideas.
I'd use it on the girl first.
You won't forget that, will you?
She's very upset about all the lies you told her.
- What lies?
- That her brother died in the morning.
Where is she?
With her mother.
No need to disturb her.
Just pick up your bits and pieces and clear out, quietly.
Terese, I've got to talk to you.
No more lies.
I know the truth about Michel's death.
- I told you the truth about that.
- Did you?
- He died in the night.
I felt the pain.
- Terese...
Listen, it didn't happen that way.
- Mother needs the priest.
- I'm sorry.
I'll get him.
Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum, adveniat regnum tuum fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra...
Yes, it was an easy death.
No struggle.
Of course, you know that you'll have to move out of the house.
You know, you understand that.
In the circumstances.
Or she'll have to have someone come in from the village.
- as a companion.
- That's for her to decide.
Yes, I know, but she's very young.
Simple sort of person.
She's seen life in Paris.
She's not just a country girl.
One place is a lot like another.
It's all a question of observation and a little wisdom.
I've spent 50 years in this backwater of a place.
And I haven't missed very much, I can tell you.
Of life, I mean.
You seem to be a man of some education.
Erm, are you telling me that this is none of my business?
- What are you saying?
- I'm talking about human nature.
I mean, you can't sit day after day as I do, listening to people, men and women, telling about themselves without getting to know something about human nature.
And she's in a state now where she might do something foolish.
- She's mourning for her mother.
- These emotions have things in common.
People talk about the sorrow there is in lust.
But you forget that sometimes there's a little lust in sorrow too.
You wouldn't want to take advantage of that, would you, my son?
Please trust me, Father.
I only want what's good for her.
That's good.
Very good.
Why can't you all leave me alone?
You are alone.
So alone.
But you need never be alone again.
You've hated me for so long but it's all over now.
You don't have to worry about anything... ever again.
- I'm so tired.
- You can rest now, Terese.
I thought I could trust Jean.
But he lied to me about Michel.
You can trust me.
Because I've told you the worst.
Everything there is to know.
I suppose so.
Terese...
- I didn't know you were there.
- Did you see the old man home?
I think it's time I told you who I am.
I am Jean-Louis Chavel.
You're mad.
The man who calls himself Chavel is a collaborator, wanted by the police for murder.
He's crazy!
I don't understand.
I don't know any more who's lying.
He's lying.
Why did you say you recognised me?
Because I was afraid to tell you who I was.
Terese, I knew you hated Chavel.
When this man came, I saw my chance to lose myself forever.
He could have all of your hatred instead.
It's more lies.
Why don't you just clear out?
Go!
What the hell are you doing?
When I was a boy, I used to play a game with a friend across the fields.
I used to take a torch like this, or if it was a sunny day, a mirror, and I would flash a message.
One message was a sort of joke.
"The Indians are attacking!"
It meant, "Come at once!"
He's just trying to fool us.
He still lives across the field, my old friend, Roche.
The Resistance man.
It's about now he goes out to his cows so he'll see this light flashing on and off.
The old code, "Come at once. "
So he'll know Chavel is back.
No one else would send this message.
- You're bluffing.
- Roche saw you on the road, at the dance.
He didn't look very closely.
He saw a shabby stranger.
This message will tell him I'm back.
Drop that torch.
Tell him to drop the torch or I'll fire.
Drop the torch!
- Are you hurt?
- I'm all right.
And you really are Chavel?
Yes.
But that was another lie, about the message.
You never flashed the same way twice.
It's the last lie, Terese.
I promise you.
I had to get him to shoot.
He won't come back now.
- But he'll get away.
- No.
Roche and the others will pick him up.
You're safe now.
You are hurt.
Terese...
Terese, listen to me.
There's an envelope in my room on my table.
- Get it.
You may need it.
It will help you.
- Shh.
- In it, I've written my will.
- Gently.
Everything... the house, everything...
is yours.
- Does that matter now?
- Listen.
The decree.
Take the will to Roche.
He'll help you.
God!
Terese, the hatred, is it all gone?
That's good.
That's good, Terese.
Terese...
You'll be all right now.

(aeroplane approaching)
(Radio) Following their successful invasion of the Soviet Union there's an increased deployment of German troops to the Eastern front.
The so-called Resistance groups received another blow yesterday.
Three terrorists were shot dead... (Woman) Good morning, Monsieur ChaveI.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
(Woman on PA) The train from Paris is arriving at 08:35.
We apologise for the delay.
(Man on PA) The train will be leaving from platform seven.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Monsieur ChaveI.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
The new German financial regulations, monsieur.
jules.
Check, please.
Right away, Monsieur ChaveI.
(yelling)
(Screaming)
(soldiers yelling)
- We need one more.
- We need one more!
(Grunts)
Why me?
I'm a lawyer.
Let me go!
Who's in charge?
Let me go!
It's a mistake.
I'm an ordinary man.
(soldier) Come on.
(2nd soldier) And you.
(Siren wailing)
(soldier) Forwards!
Move it!
Come on!
Come on!
Out!
Do as you're told, come on.
Where are we?
This is ridiculous.
There's been some mistake.
Who's in charge?
Come on, you!
Forwards when I tell you!
There's been some mistake.
I'm a lawyer.
I want to see someone in charge.
I demand to speak to that officer.
Ah!
quickly, quickly.
(soldier) In you go.
And you.
Hey, Breton, what time is it?
- 8:50.
- 40.
It's 8:40.
It's pretty, your antique, but it doesn't keep good time any more.
It's 8:40.
You should know that a piece of rubbish from a market stall is bound to slow down.
It's not made to last.
8:50.
Ran into some trouble?
(Gasping) Yes.
Who...
Who's in charge?
I need to talk to someone.
- Save your breath.
- I've done nothing.
- There's no reason for me to be here.
- No reason for any of us.
What's the matter?
Don't tell me you don't know what's going on.
Every now and then they run out and grab a few people off the street.
Then they keep us in cold storage...
till needed.
Very simple.
Any resistance, sabotage, trouble... the Germans shoot a few hostages to restore law and order.
Then they round up a few more.
They think it works quite well.
- (Laughs) There must be some way.
- Let's see.
Do you know anyone useful?
- Hauptführer?
- No.
Even a colonel could help.
Nothing going on?
So far.
(bell tolling)
This is where they do it.
They march down the yard, and round the back.
And then you hear the shots.
You and I must be the only professional men in here.
Lorry driver, shop assistant, tobacconist...
Iabourers.
michel Mangeot calls himself a clerk but was unemployed when they picked him up.
I myself was mayor of Bouges but I don't think the three-coIoured sash would look its best with this.
There must be something we can do, even here.
The law exists to protect the innocent.
My son wouldn't agree with you.
He believes money pressed into the right palm always does the trick.
Everyone back inside!
Time for sIops.
(Guard) halt!
If only I couId let someone know, make contact.
My son probably thinks I'm dead.
He'II have sold the family silver.
(Guard) Move on.
halt.
The local shooting gallery.
You ever kill a man?
No.
No, I've never killed anyone.
I've never faced a man with a gun either.
(Guard) Move on!
(bell chiming in distance)
(Man) OK.
Are you ready for this?
Your socks.
Raise you two buttons and a shoelace.
(2nd man) I'm in for two cigarettes.
Two cigarettes...
and I'II raise you my waistcoat.
- I see that.
- full house.
Threes and nines.
I'm finished.
I'm hanging on to my trousers.
Me too.
Four tens.
I win.
It seems calm.
generally is.
early on.
- Were you here when they shot the others?
- Yes.
They do it in the morning.
Seven o'cIock.
- You saw the place?
- Oh, yes.
Wooden posts and a...a stone wall.
It's not much of a wall now.
bullet holes all over it.
terrible.
AII chipped.
They must be lousy shots.
Good enough, though.
(Train whistle)
I've never really been out of Paris.
FontainebIeau.
I went there one summer.
For the day.
With my mother and my sister.
It was nice.
I'd Iike to have travelled a bit.
- I suppose you've been all over.
- Mm?
No, not really.
Just in the army, but I didn't get further than the barracks at marseille.
They wouldn't take me.
I don't want to go anywhere again.
Just to St Jean de Brinac, my home.
It's about...
It's just...about an hour outside Paris.
Nice place, is it?
I bet you've got a real mansion.
Mm.
Funny old place, really.
The staircase.
I couId do you a drawing with this pen if you Iike.
Don't.
It's your house, not mine.
My father owned it, Iike his father before him.
I may retire there one day.
What was your father's job?
He was a lawyer, Iike his father before him.
I suppose it's all right.
Seems a bit dusty to me.
Oh... (Sighs)
You can rely on the Iaw.
It's not Iike family or friends.
The law never lets you down.
unless you're on the wrong side of it.
(explosion, machine-gun fire)
I thought you said it was too early for trouble.
- (Siren wailing) - (Officer, outside) Come with me!
Come with me!
Move!
What time is it?
half past six.
- I thought it was later.
- It is.
It's twenty to seven.
Your piece of junk is fast.
Look out!
I have an announcement.
Outrages were committed in the city last night.
The second-in-command to the military governor was murdered.
also, a girl on a bicycle.
We do not complain about the girl.
Frenchmen have our permission to kill Frenchwomen if they wish to.
Do not blame us for the consequences.
blame your own so-caIIed Resistance.
My orders are... that in this prison, one man in every ten... is to be shot.
You are 30.
Your contribution then is...three.
We are quite indifferent as to which three.
This time... choose for yourselves.
The execution will take place at seven tomorrow morning.
well, what do we do?
volunteer?
We could draw lots.
unless it's felt we should go by age, oldest first.
That wouldn't be right.
We've lived our life.
It's the way of nature.
Not always.
We'II draw lots.
surely that's the fairest way.
How do we do it?
flip a coin?
We can't get an even chance with a coin.
The only way's a draw.
You can use this letter.
The backs are blank.
But why three lives for one?
It's not fair.
I don't go along with it!
We...we must demand to see a superior officer.
That's no good.
You can see the marked ones.
We need a shoe to put them in.
Krogh's got the biggest feet.
- Who's going first?
- alphabetical order.
- Going backwards.
- You would say that.
For God's sake, do we have to squabble over this?
OK...
Nobody here before V?
Nobody?
OK.
Here goes.
That's it.
Tough luck on Voisin, but it's improved the odds.
AII right, who's next?
U, T, S...?
The hell with this!
We've all got to take a slip.
Let's get on with it.
Two.
- Ha!
- Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight...
Nine...
Who's the tenth man?
Mangeot, you next.
Ten.
eleven.
twelve.
Thirteen...
Fourteen.
Fifteen...
Sixteen.
Seventeen...
Eighteen.
Nineteen...
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two...
- May I join you?
- Twenty-three...
Twenty-four...
Twenty-five, twenty-six...
Twenty-seven...
- You looked!
- I did not look!
He didn't.
(Gasps)
Come and sit with us, Monsieur ChaveI.
I didn't agree to this draw.
Come and sit down.
You can't do anything about it.
But why...?
- I'm an innocent man.
- Look at it this way.
If it's not now, it's another time.
None of us live forever.
You can't make me do this!
It's not up to us, is it?
You can't make me do this!
I'II give 100,000 francs to anyone... who'II take this.
100,000 francs.
please.
100,000.
please, 100,000 francs!
I'II give 100,000 francs.
please!
No one's going to give his life for money he'II never enjoy.
It's obvious.
I'II give you everything I've got.
Everything.
My land, my house, everything.
please.
- Nobody wants to die.
- Rich or poor.
So just shut up!
tell me more.
Maybe I'II take your offer.
100,000 francs, my land, my house, everything I've got.
- How rich are you?
- Don't laugh at him.
I'm not laughing, I'm doing a deal.
You'II take my place?
- I'II take your place.
- What use is his money when you're dead?
I have a mother and a sister.
I can make a will.
I don't like this.
We can't buy our lives.
Why should he?
If you've got money, you can do what you Iike.
Buy another man's life?
Why not?
- It's not fair.
- Why isn't it fair to let me do what I want?
I'm going to die a rich man.
Anyone who thinks it isn't fair can rot in hell.
Come here.
Sit down.
How much money is there?
300,000 francs, approximately.
approximately?
- well.
And the place?
- The orchards, the farmland, the house...
- What about Paris?
- The office is rented.
- Any family?
- No, none.
Right.
You're a lawyer.
You better draw everything up properly.
Make me out a - what's it called?
- Deed of gift.
- Right.
Make it out to me.
michel Mangeot.
michel...
Mangeot.
"I, Jean-Louis ChaveI...
"of St Jean de Brinac...
"give all stocks and shares, all money to account
"and all furniture...
"and contents of St Jean de Brinac
"and the freehold of said property..."
I need, er, two witnesses.
No, not you.
I want living men as witnesses.
Perhaps you could.
There's my pen.
- It's a very odd document.
- Give it here.
I'II sign.
Better have somebody respectable if this is to be taken seriously.
Right.
Now my will.
To my mother and sister equally.
I want something to show the neighbours what sort of man I was.
You keep the documents.
They'II let you send them off when they've finished.
(Coughs)
I'm a rich man.
always knew I'd be rich one day.
(Mangeot) ChaveI...
tell me about my house.
It's about a mile outside the village.
How many rooms?
There is the drawing room, the dining room, six bedrooms, my study...a kitchen...
- tell me about the kitchen.
- The housekeeper didn't complain.
Where's she?
I don't know.
Maybe she left, shut everything up.
Garden?
Oh, yes, there's a fountain and some roses.
- Can I grow vegetables?
- Oh, yes.
Some fruit... apples and plums, and there's... there's a beautiful walnut tree.
walnut tree.
Yes.
How old's the house?
It was built in 1780.
Pity.
My mother has trouble with her lungs.
I'd have liked something modern.
(chuckles)
(Guard) Lights out!
Mangeot... it's no good.
I must have been out of my mind.
We'II call it off.
Look, I don't want this any more.
Waiting in line for the bucket latrine, eating sIops, coughing my guts up day after day.
Then, if I'm lucky, back on the streets.
I'm going out in style.
Your style.
Mangeot, listen to me.
I won't let you do it.
I don't want to die, God knows, I don't want to die.
But I can't.
You've got a family.
Yes.
And in my family, when we say we're going to do something, we do it.
It's too late.
We did a deal.
What time is it?
- Six minutes to seven.
- Four minutes past.
(Door opens)
Come on!
(bell tolling)
(Door slams)
(Officer) Ready?
Aim!
Fire!
(Cheering)
What do you want?
You won't find anyone there.
They closed down years ago.
It's a nice ring.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(bell rings)
(Horse neighs)
Why does every passing tramp have to ring this bell?
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
- You need food?
- I don't want much.
I haven't much in the house.
Where are you from?
I was in Paris, but there's no work, so I thought I'd head south.
- Don't bring in dirt.
I've scrubbed that step.
- I'II take my shoes off.
There's some food in the kitchen.
(Laughs nervously)
Which...which way do I go?
Where's...?
Where's what?
Your mother.
Er...
Where's your mother?
- How do you know about my mother?
- Your brother told me.
- You knew michel?
- Yes.
When?
Were you with him in prison?
Yes.
Terese!
- Mother doesn't know.
- About his death?
The other business.
She thinks he made a fortune.
- What's your name?
- Jean Perrette.
Did you know the other one?
Oh, yes, I knew him.
- Who is this?
- Somebody who knew michel.
- You knew michel?
- Yes.
He said I should look you up if...
well, we all said that kind of thing.
He was a wonderful boy.
He bought all this for his old mother.
silly boy.
I was OK where I was.
We had three nice little rooms in clichy.
Cosy.
Here, we're cut off from the world.
It's too much for an old woman.
I thought he'd left enough so you'd be comfortable.
There's things money can't buy.
He's hungry.
well, give him some food.
If he wants food, he should ask.
You'd think he was a beggar.
I'm not begging.
I can pay for food.
I have a few francs.
ShouIdn't be so free with your money.
It won't get you anywhere.
Look at those socks!
There's some bread and cheese.
- tell me about him.
- michel?
Everybody liked him.
I didn't mean michel.
I mean the other one, ChaveI.
I Iooked at that name on the documents.
Jean-Louis ChaveI.
I've got a feeling he'II be back.
He won't be able to resist seeing what's happened to his beautiful house.
We're always getting strangers at the door, hungry, looking for a meal.
But every time that bell starts to jangle I think to myself,
"Maybe this time that's him."
- And if it was?
- I'd spit in his face.
That's the first thing I'd do.
And then I'd kill him.
If it wasn't for her, I'd set light to the place.
What a fool michel was.
Did he really think I'd rather have this than him?
half of me's dead.
The night they shot him, I felt the pain.
I sat up in bed and I felt this pain.
It wasn't at night, it was in the morning.
- Not in the night?
- No.
What did it mean, that pain I felt that night?
Nothing.
It's often the way.
We think there's a meaning, then we find the facts are wrong.
You wake up with a pain and you think that... but things don't fit.
tell me what ChaveI looks like.
He was just an ordinary man, Iike the rest of us.
- Ordinary?
- Yes...
We are taught to forgive our enemies.
I can't forgive him.
And one day, I know I'II see his face.
- I think I should be going.
- Where are you going?
What did you do before?
I was in the civil service.
Nothing special.
Ministry of education.
- Don't you have any family?
- No.
We could do with some help.
This place takes a Iot of cleaning.
- And there's the garden.
- I don't...
Beneath you, is it?
No.
There wouldn't be any problem with wages.
We're rich.
Yes, I think I couId stay for a while.
I'II get you some socks.
He won't miss them.
There's plenty to do, as you can see, but the main thing I'II be paying you for is to keep an eye out for him.
I don't know what he looks like.
You do.
You can sleep in here.
This is the maid's room.
I suppose so.
Not much of a room, is it?
You should see his.
I can't bear to go in there.
- It's only a room.
- It's full of him.
The smell of his cologne, the polish of his fine shoes.
There's a bowl of potpourri on the chest.
I wonder who put that there.
His mother...probably.
What are you doing?
I nearly fell over it.
I thought I'd clean it up.
It's a dust trap, all that fancy carving.
still, it's a nice frame.
Maybe you'd Iike to hang it somewhere.
- would you Iike that?
- Why not?
Erm...
Here.
Is this where it went?
Very good.
Yes, that's where it went.
I'm going to market tomorrow.
Anything you want?
A razor?
Shave that beard off, see what you look like.
No, I Iike my beard.
You ought to hire a cart from the village.
It's a Iong walk, carrying all that.
I can't ask them in the village.
That's his territory.
- He never had much to do with them.
- How do you know?
I heard him telling your brother.
He said the people here never felt at ease with him.
I'm not surprised.
Or maybe he said he never had much to do with them.
You see, as he grew up, he grew away from them.
Or so he said.
They seem to have talked a good deal.
Yes.
I think michel felt he was living his whole life that night.
"tell me about my house," he said, "my garden."
- Why are you bothering with the bushes?
- They're raspberries and redcurrants.
They're almost ripe.
It's crazy buying all that stuff from the market.
If we clear this garden, we could... you could grow all you need.
Making yourself at home, aren't you?
Sitting here.
Stuck in the kitchen.
What's the point of being rich?
We should have real servants.
Not tramps who come in off the road.
Does it need salt?
No, it's fine.
Stuck!
- Can't even get to Mass.
- Why?
It's too far.
Even climbing the stairs is like climbing a mountain for me some days.
Once... on the 14th of july...
I was dancing in the streets.
I danced all night.
Eight o'cIock, we opened up the shop and I worked in it all day and I didn't even feel tired.
Your father used to say that I was like a butterfly.
butterfly.
We could help you.
You could lean on us.
We'II see.
(bell tolling)
Don't you want to go in?
I've got nothing to say to God any more.
Mother wanted to know why I didn't go to church any more.
told her I'd lost my faith.
But it's the hate that keeps me away.
I can't drop my hate at the church door and pick it up an hour later on the way out.
It goes on and on.
AII day and all night.
It's all there is.
CouIdn't you try going out once in a while?
See something new.
people like us don't do that sort of thing.
We did go to FontainebIeau once, with michel.
That was a lovely day.
Mother likes to pretend but we were as poor as hell.
ChaveI made a good living.
He must be a hard, calculating sort of person.
Why do you say that?
You don't become a rich lawyer by accident.
You know he inherited that law practice?
AII he ever wanted to do was hurry back to his house and garden.
Just like a failure, afraid of...being found out.
You sound as though you hate him too.
Hm?
No.
No, I despise him, just for what he did.
Hey, Iet's go here.
This way.
His parents.
Both died the same year.
Where did you get those?
They make you look like an old man.
I found them in the market.
I won't be fobbed off with rotten food now.
I can see what I'm doing.
It was a bit thin in the market this morning.
Thought we could get a rabbit or something.
Here's your change.
And the list.
You'd better check it.
- I trust you.
- Your mother doesn't.
Here.
That's strange.
Your writing looks familiar.
It's very ordinary writing.
Quite characterIess.
Strange.
It's like that feeling you get when you think you've been somewhere before.
Oh, well.
could you put the change in the drawer?
I'm sorry, I...
I couldn't sleep so I came down to get myself some water.
I thought I heard a noise, a bird falling down the chimney.
- Maybe it was a rat.
- No rat's been here for three years.
Why don't you clear all this stuff out?
I couldn't bear to touch it.
But have anything you Iike if it fits you.
silly to leave it rotting here.
Poor thing.
Imagine being the mother of a monster like that.
You know, there was a point that night when he tried to call it off.
He didn't want to go through with it.
- But your brother refused.
- Once.
- He really tried.
- He acted the coward, I agree.
But anyone can play the coward once.
Many of us do, in fact, and you forget about it afterwards.
It's just that in his case, it was so...spectacular.
You mean he was unlucky.
Everyone's tested at some point.
It can happen any time.
And then you discover what you've been all your life, what you are.
Do you know what you are, really?
No.
But I will one day.
And I know what he is.
He's a murderer.
AII I want is him in front of me, and me with a gun.
I suppose afterwards you'II go to confession and you'II feel happy again.
No.
But perhaps I wouldn't feel so tired.
And old.
And afraid of people.
I couId start living.
Can I get you some water?
There's no need for that.
I can't sleep anyway.
Are you tired?
- Want a lift?
- No, thank you.
You're MademoiseIIe Mangeot, aren't you?
My name is Roche.
This is Monsieur Perrette.
- I've seen you in the market.
- He's helping us.
You want to be careful.
There's a Iot of strangers, funny people.
He's a friend.
You haven't got much to say.
Maybe I should look at your papers.
You sound like a policeman.
It's my business to keep an eye on things, from Resistance days.
- The war's over.
- Don't you believe it.
It's just beginning.
collaborators creeping out from their little nests.
He was locked up by the Germans and knew my brother.
- And you knew ChaveI?
- Yes.
- You two must have been friends.
- When we were kids.
Later, well, he was from the big house.
My family are just farmers.
- What was he like?
- Kept himself to himself.
Afraid of the girls, scared of taking risks.
Why don't they like us in the village?
It's just that they didn't believe your story.
They couldn't believe a man would die for money.
They thought the Germans must be mixed up in it.
He did it for you, of course.
You won't have any more trouble.
I'II have a word.
We're having a celebration on Sunday.
Start of the hunting season.
There'II be dancing.
Come along.
Maybe.
Go on.
- would you Iike an apéritif?
- Oh, no.
Didn't do that in Paris.
CouIdn't afford to.
A glass of wine.
I can afford it.
I'm paid a fair wage now.
Oh!
Thank you.
It's really strange, sitting here like a lady of leisure.
Do you ever think about the future, what you'II do?
I mean, er...
You'II want to get married one day.
There's not much to choose from round here.
There's Roche, the great Resistance hero.
- And then there's you, of course.
- Ah, yes.
No.
You'II be off, back to your own sort.
Find a job and a girl who works in the civil service.
- Knows about things.
- I'd Iike to stay here.
Maybe we should go to that dance Roche mentioned.
I'm not too keen on those things.
You go.
I wouldn't go on my own.
But it wouId have been nice.
(.' Accordion playing)
(Terese singing, ChaveI whistling)
She's gone to bed.
They seemed friendly.
Maybe they don't hate us.
Of course they don't hate you.
well, good night.
You don't have to use the back stairs.
You're not a servant.
- Terese?
Is that you?
- Yes.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I think we should eat in the dining room tonight.
There's no need to behave like Gypsies.
It's our house.
- (Wheezing) It'II need cleaning out.
- I'II do it.
(Mother coughing)
Ah, yes.
I'II get some water.
Look.
His whole life's in here.
Him in his cradle.
The christening.
That old priest's still in the village.
And here...is Jean-Louis at his first communion.
That priest again.
He called on us, Iet us know ChaveI used to have him for dinner at Christmas.
Mother let him know there wouldn't be any more grand dinners.
What a bunch.
Mean.
Hard eyes.
No wonder he turned out the way he did.
Can you imagine them doing something human, Iike dancing or kissing?
Can you imagine them in love?
- How would they show love?
- I suppose they... expressed it just like you... and me.
(DoorbeII jangIes)
I suppose that's your admirer Roche, come to pay his respects.
Open up, or Mother will start yelling.
Yes.
(Thunder rolling)
- Who is it?
- Jean-Louis ChaveI.
- Who?
- ChaveI.
Open the door.
It's wet out here.
Who is it?
ChaveI.
- I'm sorry, can't you hear me?
- He says it's Jean-Louis ChaveI.
(Impostor) please.
Let him in.
Eh?
I apologise for breaking in on you Iike this.
- What do you want?
- shelter.
Something to eat.
You're ChaveI?
Jean-Louis ChaveI?
Yes, I'm ChaveI.
I knew you'd come one day.
I hope you'II allow me to...
Oh!
Erm...
I think you'd better go.
I can't.
They're looking for me.
Young men with guns who call themselves the Resistance.
- Why?
- This is a great time for settling scores.
Anyone who has an enemy can find himself labelled a collaborator.
But you have the perfect answer.
You were in a German prison, condemned to death.
They're saying that I was put there as an informer.
It was wrong of me to come here but a hunted animal heads for the place it knows as home.
I'm sorry.
I'II leave.
Yes.
You'd better go.
I had another reason for coming.
I had a message for mademoiselle Mangeot.
From her brother.
Message?
I'm sorry, monsieur, you are...?
You should know.
You were in the same prison.
I'm Jean Perrette.
Of course.
I thought I recognised your face.
Is this ChaveI?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
It's ChaveI.
I shouldn't have come back.
I'm...
please forgive this intrusion.
Forgive.
You have a message from my brother?
He wanted you to know that he loved you.
He thought this was the best thing he could do for you.
I'm sorry, mademoiselle, I should have realised.
I should have known that this door would no Ionger be open to me.
You don't have to go.
I wouldn't turn a dog out in this rain.
You can stay.
- It's not long till morning.
- You're very kind.
You need dry clothes.
You'II find everything in your room, as you left it.
I wouldn't presume!
It's not my room any more.
please.
Who's there?
What's all this noise?
My mother's not well.
I won't tell her who you are, she couldn't take the shock.
Who's this?
Someone who knew michel.
Another one wanting a free meal.
And a hand-out.
I wonder that my son managed to hold on to any of his money at all.
I said he could stay tonight.
What's your name?
Er, Toupard, Madame.
philippe Toupard.
- You knew my son?
- Yes, he talked about you a Iot.
You must be very proud of him.
I'm starving.
Can you come with me, monsieur?
We have a Iot to talk about.
(Thunder rolls)
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Look, I don't know what's going on here.
AII I want is...a night's shelter.
No trouble.
I was on my way to switzerland.
I got myself into something, er, rather messy, involving the police.
I thought it wise to lie low for a couple of days.
May I see your watch a moment?
A man in prison had a watch like this.
His name was...
- Breton.
- You're the son he talked about.
I had to pull quite a few strings, use friends in high places to get him out.
You think he'd be grateful.
When he found out... he threatened to kick me out of the house.
called me a collaborator.
(Laughs) Then he had a heart attack.
- What brought you here?
- well, I remembered the story.
He'd told us about a man in prison with him, who bought his life.
You know, you were there.
I thought it was worth a try.
(Terese) Jean?
!
Can you help me?
Mother's not well.
She's having her soup in her room.
Monsieur ChaveI.
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of it.
(Terese) You found everything?
(Impostor) In perfect order.
Fresh, dry clothes.
I am deeply grateful.
You're from Paris, yourself, mademoiselle Mangeot, isn't that right?
My parents are from Normandy but we were born in Paris... my brother and I.
I've forgotten the bread.
You think you can get away with this?
I reckoned ChaveI wouldn't have the nerve to come home.
I...decided to do it for him.
(Laughs) Everyone in the village will know you're not ChaveI.
I had to risk it, just for the night.
I must say, I Iike the man's style.
Mm.
It's the best soup I've ever tasted.
AII right, what's going on?
What's your game and why are you going along with my story?
To help her.
She had it in her head ChaveI would show up one day.
He became an obsession with her.
I thought this would cure it.
She could, er, start living.
Hm.
well, I think I was a bit hasty, saying I'd leave in the morning.
- I caught a look in her eye.
- You're forgetting she hates ChaveI.
But I'm not ChaveI.
Not the real ChaveI.
I'm the ChaveI she's invented for herself, not the dull reality.
- She spat in your face.
- I saw a play in Paris once, by Shakespeare, where the same thing happened.
A king murdered some woman's husband and he was practically lifting her skirt.
The actor wiped his face with his sleeve.
I remember the way he did it.
- Worked rather well.
- You should've been an actor.
When you're living off your wits, you learn to be different things to different people.
Perhaps I couId learn to be Jean-Louis ChaveI.
You won't get the chance.
You'II be gone by sunrise.
I'II make you.
- AII this must be rather a blow to you.
- What do you mean?
Anyone with half an eye can see you're in love with her.
- You must be mad.
- No, it's perfectly reasonable.
I mean, here you are, a man who's been locked up in prison for three years.
You suddenly find yourself with a young girl.
Pretty enough, but... not quite your class.
It must be like being shipwrecked on a desert island.
You should have got in there, made a play for her tonight.
Didn't you sense the emotion that was in the air?
Thanks to me.
God, I'm tired, so tired.
will you turn out the light, please?
(Door opens)
Mother had an attack in the night.
She's very bad.
- Why didn't you call me?
- It wouldn't have helped.
She wants the priest.
I said everyone was tested sooner or later, everyone.
And then you know what you are.
I am a coward, just like him.
We're one of a kind.
When it came to it, I didn't pass the test either.
- Why are you tormenting yourself?
- I should have shot him.
I said I would.
You can't give a man shelter, walk away, find a gun...
- then shoot him in cold blood.
- Why not?
He did to michel as good as.
(Sighs)
Er, you needn't think about ChaveI any longer.
He's gone.
- When?
- earlier this morning.
I would have expected...
You told him to go.
michel's really dead now.
Terese.
You've been so kind to me.
To us.
So understanding.
I couldn't have managed on my own.
could you fetch the priest?
Yes, of course.
I wonder where ChaveI will go?
switzerland, probably.
When I went into Mother, she was frightened.
She wanted me to pray for her.
I knelt there, mumbling all that stuff about forgiveness of sins.
I felt terrible.
You didn't seem so anxious to forgive him before you saw him.
It's not so easy to hate a face you know as a face you imagine.
I'II fetch the priest.
I'II take the short cut over the field.
Yes?
Who is it?
What is it?
Sorry to trouble you, Father.
It's Madame Mangeot.
Oh, yes.
I was expecting something of the kind.
- It's heart trouble, I suppose?
- Yes, her daughter asked me...
Is it raining outside?
- No, it's not.
- Good.
That's good.
That's good.
Can I take that, Father?
She's breathing a little easier now.
Thank you, Father.
Send for me if you need me.
I'II go to the market.
I'II be back as quick as I can.
(DoorbeII jangIes)
I'm sorry to break in on you again.
I got as far as the village and I heard about your mother.
I'm so very sorry.
- I hope it wasn't me.
- She knows nothing of you.
Oh, good.
I wouldn't want to add to her troubles.
We talked about her, that night.
The night your brother died.
The night?
- He died in the night?
- Yes, of course.
In the night.
- But Jean said he died in the morning.
- I'm afraid he was Iying.
Why would he lie about that?
Why?
To make me look worse than I am, I suppose.
I mean, it is worse to let a man die after a whole night to think about it.
Yes.
He said you tried once to call it off.
Yes.
I didn't have another chance.
- They took him away.
- I knew it was in the night.
I woke suddenly with a pain.
- Why did he say that...?
- You don't know this man.
He's a liar, and a cheat.
But you bought your life.
There are so many things you don't understand.
- Your brother was a sick man.
- I know.
He loved you very much.
He worried about what would happen to you, the money, Germans...
We talked about that.
He showed me your photograph.
He didn't have a photograph of me.
But he...
Oh, I know, it was a picture torn out of a newspaper.
Er, a street scene.
A beautiful girl, haIf-hidden in the crowd.
I suppose it reminded him of you.
people do funny things in prison.
Then he asked me what I would give for his blank slip.
What?
- He asked you?
- I know I'm a coward.
I took his offer.
If I'd been guilty of worse than that, do you think I would have dared to come back?
I don't expect you to believe me.
Why should you?
Goodbye and God bless.
There is just one thing that I think you should know.
- Thought you'd left.
- I decided to stay.
I had a Iong talk with the girl.
Gave her my version of what happened that night.
(Laughs) It's terribly unfair.
But that's life, isn't it?
She's very angry.
She wants you to clear out.
- She's letting you stay?
- She hadn't any choice.
I told her about the decree of the 17th of August.
She hadn't heard about it.
You haven't either, have you?
It makes illegal all changes of property under the German occupation if one party disputes the deal.
It's true.
I'm not making it up.
So as far as she's concerned, the place is mine.
(Laughs)
You can't make use of it.
You're on the run, a collaborator, wanted for murder.
Ah, yes, you saw the posters.
I'II just have to lie low until it's safe to push on to switzerland.
Things will quieten down.
Even a day's shelter is a help in my situation.
Or a week.
Anyway, it's time you left.
- You think I'II say nothing?
- I would advise you not to.
I wouldn't want the girl hurt and as you so very rightly say, I'm already wanted for murder, so I've nothing to lose.
Do you think ChaveI will show up?
Is he the type?
probably he's on his way here now.
well, if the worst comes to the worst, I've got the gun, haven't I?
Yes, I've got the gun.
So don't get any...clever ideas.
I'd use it on the girl first.
You won't forget that, will you?
She's very upset about all the lies you told her.
- What lies?
- That her brother died in the morning.
Where is she?
With her mother.
No need to disturb her.
Just pick up your bits and pieces and clear out, quietly.
Terese, I've got to talk to you.
No more lies.
I know the truth about michel's death.
- I told you the truth about that.
- Did you?
- He died in the night.
I felt the pain.
- (Mother) Terese...
Listen, it didn't happen that way.
- Mother needs the priest.
- I'm sorry.
I'II get him.
Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum, adveniat regnum tuum fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra...
Yes, it was an easy death.
No struggle.
Of course, you know that you'II have to move out of the house.
Or she'II have to have someone come in from the village
- as a companion.
- That's for her to decide.
Yes, I know, but she's very young.
simple sort of person.
She's seen life in Paris.
She's not just a country girl.
One place is a Iot like another.
It's all a question of observation and a little wisdom.
I've spent 50 years in this backwater of a place.
And I haven't missed very much, I can tell you.
Of life, I mean.
You seem to be a man of some education.
Erm, are you telling me that this is none of my business?
- What are you saying?
- I'm talking about human nature.
I mean, you can't sit day after day as I do,
listening to people, men and women, telling about themselves without getting to know something about human nature.
And she's in a state now where she might do something foolish.
- She's mourning for her mother.
- These emotions have things in common.
people talk about the sorrow there is in lust.
But you forget that sometimes there's a little lust in sorrow too.
You wouldn't want to take advantage of that, would you, my son?
please trust me, Father.
I only want what's good for her.
That's good.
Very good.
(Dog barking, chickens crowing)
(Terese) Why can't you all leave me alone?
(Impostor) You are alone.
So alone.
But you need never be alone again.
You've hated me for so long but it's all over now.
You don't have to worry about anything... ever again.
- I'm so tired.
- You can rest now, Terese.
I thought I couId trust Jean.
But he lied to me about michel.
(Impostor) You can trust me.
Because I've told you the worst.
Everything there is to know.
I suppose so.
Terese...
- I didn't know you were there.
- Did you see the old man home?
I think it's time I told you who I am.
I am Jean-Louis ChaveI.
You're mad.
The man who calls himself ChaveI is a collaborator, wanted by the police for murder.
(Laughs nervously) He's crazy!
I don't understand.
I don't know any more who's lying.
He's lying.
Why did you say you recognised me?
Because I was afraid to tell you who I was.
Terese, I knew you hated ChaveI.
When this man came, I saw my chance to lose myself forever.
He could have all of your hatred instead.
It's more lies.
Why don't you just clear out?
Go!
What the hell are you doing?
When I was a boy, I used to play a game with a friend across the fields.
I used to take a torch like this or, if it was a sunny day, a mirror, and I would flash a message.
One message was a sort of joke.
"The Indians are attacking!"
It meant, "Come at once!"
He's just trying to fool us.
He still lives across the field, my old friend, Roche.
The Resistance man.
It's about now he goes out to his cows so he'II see this light flashing on and off.
The old code, "Come at once."
So he'II know ChaveI is back.
No one else would send this message.
- You're bluffing.
- Roche saw you on the road, at the dance.
He didn't look very closely.
He saw a shabby stranger.
This message will tell him I'm back.
Drop that torch.
tell him to drop the torch or I'II fire.
Drop the torch!
(Dog barking in distance)
(click)
- Are you hurt?
- I'm all right.
And you really are ChaveI?
Yes.
But that was another lie, about the message.
You never flashed the same way twice.
It's the Iast lie, Terese.
I promise you.
I had to get him to shoot.
He won't come back now.
- But he'II get away.
- No.
Roche and the others will pick him up.
You're safe now. (Gasps)
You are hurt.
Terese...
Terese, listen to me.
There's an envelope in my room on my table.
- Get it.
You may need it.
It will help you.
- Shh.
- In it, I've written my will.
- gently.
Everything - the house, everything - is yours.
- Does that matter now?
- Listen.
The decree.
Take the will to Roche.
He'II help you.
God!
Terese, the hatred, is it all gone?
That's good.
That's good, Terese.
Terese... (Gasps)
You'II be all right now.
(clock chimes)

ENHOH
Following their successful invasion of the Soviet Union there's an increased deployment of German troops to the Eastern front.
The so-called Resistance groups received another blow yesterday.
Three terrorists were shot dead...
Good morning, Monsieur Chavel.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
The train from Paris is arriving at 08:35.
We apologise for the delay.
The train will be leaving from platform seven.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Monsieur Chavel.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
The new German financial regulations Monseiur Chavel.
Jules.
Check, please.
Right away, Monsieur Chavel.
- We need one more.
- We need one more!
Why me?
I'm a lawyer.
Let me go!
Who's in charge?
Let me go!
It's a mistake.
I'm an ordinary man.
- Come on.
- And you.
Look, I've done nothing wrong!
Forwards!
Move it!
Come on!
Come on!
Out!
Do as you're told, come on.
Where are we?
This is ridiculous.
There's been some mistake.
Who's in charge?
Come on, you!
Forwards when I tell you!
There's been some mistake.
I'm a lawyer.
I want to see someone in charge.
I demand to speak to that officer.
Ah!
Quickly, quickly.
In you go.
And you.
Hey, Breton, what time is it?
- 8:50.
- 40.
It's 8:40.
It's pretty, your antique, but it doesn't keep good time any more.
It's 8:40.
You should know that a piece of rubbish from a market stall is bound to slow down.
It's not made to last.
8:50.
Ran into some trouble?
Yes.
Who...
Who's in charge?
I need to talk to someone.
- Save your breath.
- I've done nothing.
- There's no reason for me to be here.
- No reason for any of us.
What's the matter?
Don't tell me you don't know what's going on.
Every now and then they run out and grab a few people off the street.
Then they keep us in cold storage...
till needed.
Very simple.
Any resistance, sabotage, trouble... the Germans shoot a few hostages to restore law and order.
Then they round up a few more.
They think it works quite well.
- There must be some way.
- Let's see.
Do you know anyone useful?
- Hauptfuhrer?
- No.
Even a colonel could help.
Nothing going on?
So far.
This is where they do it.
They march down the yard, and round the back.
And then you hear the shots.
You and I must be the only professional men in here.
Lorry driver, shop assistant, tobacconist...
labourers.
Michel Mangeot calls himself a clerk but was unemployed when they picked him up.
I myself was mayor of Bouges but I don't think the three-coloured sash would look its best with this.
There must be something we can do, even here.
The law exists to protect the innocent.
My son wouldn't agree with you.
He believes money pressed into the right palm always does the trick.
Everyone back inside!
Time for slops.
Halt!
If only I could let someone know, make contact.
My son probably thinks I'm dead.
He'll have sold the family silver.
Move on.
Halt.
The local shooting gallery.
You ever kill a man?
No.
No, I've never killed anyone.
I've never faced a man with a gun either.
Move on!
OK.
Are you ready for this?
Your socks.
Raise you two buttons and a shoelace.
I'm in for two cigarettes.
Two cigarettes...
and I'll raise you my waistcoat.
- I see that.
- Full house.
Threes and nines.
I'm finished.
I'm hanging on to my trousers.
Me too.
Four tens.
I win.
It seems calm.
Generally is.
Early on.
- Were you here when they shot the others?
- Yes.
They do it in the morning.
Seven o'clock.
- You saw the place?
- Oh, yes.
Wooden posts and a... a stone wall.
It's not much of a wall now.
Bullet holes all over it.
Terrible.
All chipped.
They must be lousy shots.
Good enough, though.
I've never really been out of Paris.
Fontainebleau.
I went there one summer.
For the day.
With my mother and my sister.
It was nice.
I'd like to have travelled a bit.
- I suppose you've been all over.
- Mm?
No, not really.
Just in the army, but I didn't get further than the barracks at Marseille.
They wouldn't take me.
I don't want to go anywhere again.
Just to St Jean de Brinac, my home.
It's about...
It's just... about an hour outside Paris.
Nice place, is it?
I bet you've got a real mansion.
Mm.
Funny old place, really.
The staircase.
I could do you a drawing with this pen if you like.
Don't.
It's your house, not mine.
My father owned it, like his father before him.
I may retire there one day.
What was your father's job?
He was a lawyer, like his father before him.
I suppose it's all right.
Seems a bit dusty to me.
Oh...
You can rely on the law.
It's not like family or friends.
The law never lets you down.
Unless you're on the wrong side of it.
I thought you said it was too early for trouble.
Come with me!
Come with me!
Move!
What time is it?
Half past six.
- I thought it was later.
- It is.
It's twenty to seven.
Your piece of junk is fast.
Look out!
I have an announcement.
Outrages were committed in the city last night.
The second-in-command to the military governor was murdered.
Also, a girl on a bicycle.
We do not complain about the girl.
Frenchmen have our permission to kill Frenchwomen if they wish to.
Do not blame us for the consequences.
Blame your own so-called Resistance.
My orders are... that in this prison, one man in every ten... is to be shot.
You are 30.
Your contribution then is... three.
We are quite indifferent as to which three.
This time... choose for yourselves.
The execution will take place at seven tomorrow morning.
Well, what do we do?
Volunteer?
We could draw lots.
Unless it's felt we should go by age, oldest first.
That wouldn't be right.
We've lived our life.
It's the way of nature.
Not always.
We'll draw lots.
Surely that's the fairest way.
How do we do it?
Flip a coin?
We can't get an even chance with a coin.
The only way's a draw.
You can use this letter.
The backs are blank.
But why three lives for one?
It's not fair.
I don't go along with it!
We... we must demand to see a superior officer.
That's no good.
You can see the marked ones.
We need a shoe to put them in.
Krogh's got the biggest feet.
- Who's going first?
- Alphabetical order.
- Going backwards.
- You would say that.
For God's sake, do we have to squabble over this?
OK...
Nobody here before V?
Nobody?
OK.
Here goes.
That's it.
Tough luck on Voisin, but it's improved the odds.
All right, who's next?
The hell with this!
We've all got to take a slip.
Let's get on with it.
Two.
- Ha!
- Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight...
Nine...
Who's the tenth man?
Mangeot, you next.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Thirteen...
Fourteen.
Fifteen...
Sixteen.
Seventeen...
Eighteen.
Nineteen...
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two...
- May I join you?
- Twenty-three...
Twenty-four...
Twenty-five, twenty-six...
Twenty-seven...
- You looked!
- I did not look!
He didn't.
Come and sit with us, Monsieur Chavel.
I didn't agree to this draw.
Come and sit down.
You can't do anything about it.
But why?
- I'm an innocent man.
- Look at it this way.
If it's not now, it's another time.
None of us live forever.
You can't make me do this!
It's not up to us, is it?
You can't make me do this!
I'll give 100,000 francs to anyone... who'll take this.
100,000 francs.
Please.
100,000.
Please, 100,000 francs!
I'll give 100,000 francs.
Please!
No one's going to give his life for money he'll never enjoy.
It's obvious.
I'll give you everything I've got.
Everything.
My land, my house, everything.
Please.
- Nobody wants to die.
- Rich or poor.
So just shut up!
Tell me more.
Maybe I'll take your offer.
100,000 francs, my land, my house, everything I've got.
- How rich are you?
- Don't laugh at him.
I'm not laughing, I'm doing a deal.
You'll take my place?
- I'll take your place.
- What use is his money when you're dead?
I have a mother and a sister.
I can make a will.
I don't like this.
We can't buy our lives.
Why should he?
If you've got money, you can do what you like.
Buy another man's life?
Why not?
- It's not fair.
- Why isn't it fair to let me do what I want?
I'm going to die a rich man.
Anyone who thinks it isn't fair can rot in hell.
Come here.
Sit down.
How much money is there?
300,000 francs, approximately.
Approximately?
- Well.
And the place?
- The orchards, the farmland, the house...
- What about Paris?
- The office is rented.
- Any family?
- No, none.
Right.
You're a lawyer.
You better draw everything up properly.
Make me out a - what's it called?
- Deed of gift.
- Right.
Make it out to me.
Michel Mangeot.
Michel...
Mangeot.
"I, Jean-Louis Chavel...
"of St Jean de Brinac...
"give all stocks and shares, all money to account
"and all furniture...
"and contents of St Jean de Brinac
"and the freehold of said property..."
I need, er, two witnesses.
No, not you.
I want living men as witnesses.
Perhaps you could.
There's my pen.
- It's a very odd document.
- Give it here.
I'll sign.
Better have somebody respectable if this is to be taken seriously.
Right.
Now my will.
To my mother and sister equally.
I want something to show the neighbours what sort of man I was.
You keep the documents.
They'll let you send them off when they've finished.
I'm a rich man.
Always knew I'd be rich one day.
Chavel...
Tell me about my house.
It's about a mile outside the village.
How many rooms?
There is the drawing room, the dining room, six bedrooms, my study... a kitchen...
- Tell me about the kitchen.
- The housekeeper didn't complain.
Where's she?
I don't know.
Maybe she left, shut everything up.
Garden?
Oh, yes, there's a fountain and some roses.
- Can I grow vegetables?
- Oh, yes.
Some fruit... apples and plums, and there's... there's a beautiful walnut tree.
Walnut tree.
Yes.
How old's the house?
It was built in 1780.
Pity.
My mother has trouble with her lungs.
I'd have liked something modern.
Lights out!
Mangeot... it's no good.
I must have been out of my mind.
We'll call it off.
Look, I don't want this any more.
Waiting in line for the bucket latrine, eating slops, coughing my guts up day after day.
Then, if I'm lucky, back on the streets.
I'm going out in style.
Your style.
Mangeot, listen to me.
I won't let you do it.
I don't want to die, God knows, I don't want to die.
But I can't.
You've got a family.
Yes.
And in my family, when we say we're going to do something, we do it.
It's too late.
We did a deal.
What time is it?
- Six minutes to seven.
- Four minutes past.
Come on!
Ready?
Aim!
Fire!
What do you want?
You won't find anyone there.
They closed down years ago.
It's a nice ring.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Why does every passing tramp have to ring this bell?
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
- You need food?
- I don't want much.
I haven't much in the house.
Where are you from?
I was in Paris, but there's no work, so I thought I'd head south.
- Don't bring in dirt.
I've scrubbed that step.
- I'll take my shoes off.
There's some food in the kitchen.
Which... which way do I go?
Where's?
Where's what?
Your mother.
Er...
Where's your mother?
- How do you know about my mother?
- Your brother told me.
- You knew Michel?
- Yes.
When?
Were you with him in prison?
Yes.
Terese!
- Mother doesn't know.
- About his death?
The other business.
She thinks he made a fortune.
- What's your name?
- Jean Perrette.
Did you know the other one?
Oh, yes, I knew him.
- Who is this?
- Somebody who knew Michel.
- You knew Michel?
- Yes.
He said I should look you up if...
Well, we all said that kind of thing.
He was a wonderful boy.
He bought all this for his old mother.
Silly boy.
I was OK where I was.
We had three nice little rooms in Clichy.
Cosy.
Here, we're cut off from the world.
It's too much for an old woman.
I thought he'd left enough so you'd be comfortable.
There's things money can't buy.
He's hungry.
Well, give him some food.
If he wants food, he should ask.
You'd think he was a beggar.
I'm not begging.
I can pay for food.
I have a few francs.
Shouldn't be so free with your money.
It won't get you anywhere.
Look at those socks!
There's some bread and cheese.
- Tell me about him.
- Michel?
Everybody liked him.
I didn't mean Michel.
I mean the other one, Chavel.
I looked at that name on the documents.
Jean-Louis Chavel.
I've got a feeling he'll be back.
He won't be able to resist seeing what's happened to his beautiful house.
We're always getting strangers at the door, hungry, looking for a meal.
But every time that bell starts to jangle I think to myself,
"Maybe this time that's him."
- And if it was?
- I'd spit in his face.
That's the first thing I'd do.
And then I'd kill him.
If it wasn't for her, I'd set light to the place.
What a fool Michel was.
Did he really think I'd rather have this than him?
Half of me's dead.
The night they shot him, I felt the pain.
I sat up in bed and I felt this pain.
It wasn't at night, it was in the morning.
- Not in the night?
- No.
What did it mean, that pain I felt that night?
Nothing.
It's often the way.
We think there's a meaning, then we find the facts are wrong.
You wake up with a pain and you think that... but things don't fit.
Tell me what Chavel looks like.
He was just an ordinary man, like the rest of us.
- Ordinary?
- Yes...
We are taught to forgive our enemies.
I can't forgive him.
And one day, I know I'll see his face.
- I think I should be going.
- Where are you going?
What did you do before?
I was in the civil service.
Nothing special.
Ministry of education.
- Don't you have any family?
- No.
We could do with some help.
This place takes a lot of cleaning.
- And there's the garden.
- I don't...
Beneath you, is it?
No.
There wouldn't be any problem with wages.
We're rich.
Yes, I think I could stay for a while.
I'll get you some socks.
He won't miss them.
There's plenty to do, as you can see, but the main thing I'll be paying you for is to keep an eye out for him.
I don't know what he looks like.
You do.
You can sleep in here.
This is the maid's room.
I suppose so.
Not much of a room, is it?
You should see his.
I can't bear to go in there.
- It's only a room.
- It's full of him.
The smell of his cologne, the polish of his fine shoes.
There's a bowl of potpourri on the chest.
I wonder who put that there.
His mother... probably.
What are you doing?
I nearly fell over it.
I thought I'd clean it up.
It's a dust trap, all that fancy carving.
Still, it's a nice frame.
Maybe you'd like to hang it somewhere.
- Would you like that?
- Why not?
Erm...
Here.
Is this where it went?
Very good.
Yes, that's where it went.
I'm going to market tomorrow.
Anything you want?
A razor?
Shave that beard off, see what you look like.
No, I like my beard.
You ought to hire a cart from the village.
It's a long walk, carrying all that.
I can't ask them in the village.
That's his territory.
- He never had much to do with them.
- How do you know?
I heard him telling your brother.
He said the people here never felt at ease with him.
I'm not surprised.
Or maybe he said he never had much to do with them.
You see, as he grew up, he grew away from them.
Or so he said.
They seem to have talked a good deal.
Yes.
I think Michel felt he was living his whole life that night.
"Tell me about my house," he said, "my garden."
- Why are you bothering with the bushes?
- They're raspberries and redcurrants.
They're almost ripe.
It's crazy buying all that stuff from the market.
If we clear this garden, we could... you could grow all you need.
Making yourself at home, aren't you?
Sitting here.
Stuck in the kitchen.
What's the point of being rich?
We should have real servants.
Not tramps who come in off the road.
Does it need salt?
No, it's fine.
Stuck!
- Can't even get to Mass.
- Why?
It's too far.
Even climbing the stairs is like climbing a mountain for me some days.
Once... on the 14th of July...
I was dancing in the streets.
I danced all night.
Eight o'clock, we opened up the shop and I worked in it all day and I didn't even feel tired.
Your father used to say that I was like a butterfly.
Butterfly.
We could help you.
You could lean on us.
We'll see.
Don't you want to go in?
I've got nothing to say to God any more.
Mother wanted to know why I didn't go to church any more.
Told her I'd lost my faith.
But it's the hate that keeps me away.
I can't drop my hate at the church door and pick it up an hour later on the way out.
It goes on and on.
All day and all night.
It's all there is.
Couldn't you try going out once in a while?
See something new.
People like us don't do that sort of thing.
We did go to Fontainebleau once, with Michel.
That was a lovely day.
Mother likes to pretend but we were as poor as hell.
Chavel made a good living.
He must be a hard, calculating sort of person.
Why do you say that?
You don't become a rich lawyer by accident.
You know he inherited that law practice?
All he ever wanted to do was hurry back to his house and garden.
Just like a failure, afraid of... being found out.
You sound as though you hate him too.
Hm?
No.
No, I despise him, just for what he did.
Hey, let's go here.
This way.
His parents.
Both died the same year.
Where did you get those?
They make you look like an old man.
I found them in the market.
I won't be fobbed off with rotten food now.
I can see what I'm doing.
It was a bit thin in the market this morning.
Thought we could get a rabbit or something.
Here's your change.
And the list.
You'd better check it.
- I trust you.
- Your mother doesn't.
Here.
That's strange.
Your writing looks familiar.
It's very ordinary writing.
Quite characterless.
Strange.
It's like that feeling you get when you think you've been somewhere before.
Oh, well.
Could you put the change in the drawer?
I'm sorry, I...
I couldn't sleep so I came down to get myself some water.
I thought I heard a noise, a bird falling down the chimney.
- Maybe it was a rat.
- No rat's been here for three years.
Why don't you clear all this stuff out?
I couldn't bear to touch it.
But have anything you like if it fits you.
Silly to leave it rotting here.
Poor thing.
Imagine being the mother of a monster like that.
You know, there was a point that night when he tried to call it off.
He didn't want to go through with it.
- But your brother refused.
- Once.
- He really tried.
- He acted the coward, I agree.
But anyone can play the coward once.
Many of us do, in fact, and you forget about it afterwards.
It's just that in his case, it was so... spectacular.
You mean he was unlucky.
Everyone's tested at some point.
It can happen any time.
And then you discover what you've been all your life, what you are.
Do you know what you are, really?
No.
But I will one day.
And I know what he is.
He's a murderer.
All I want is him in front of me, and me with a gun.
I suppose afterwards you'll go to confession and you'll feel happy again.
No.
But perhaps I wouldn't feel so tired.
And old.
And afraid of people.
I could start living.
Can I get you some water?
There's no need for that.
I can't sleep anyway.
Are you tired?
- Want a lift?
- No, thank you.
You're Mademoiselle Mangeot, aren't you?
My name is Roche.
This is Monsieur Perrette.
- I've seen you in the market.
- He's helping us.
You want to be careful.
There's a lot of strangers, funny people.
He's a friend.
You haven't got much to say.
Maybe I should look at your papers.
You sound like a policeman.
It's my business to keep an eye on things, from Resistance days.
- The war's over.
- Don't you believe it.
It's just beginning.
Collaborators creeping out from their little nests.
He was locked up by the Germans and knew my brother.
- And you knew Chavel?
- Yes.
- You two must have been friends.
- When we were kids.
Later, well, he was from the big house.
My family are just farmers.
- What was he like?
- Kept himself to himself.
Afraid of the girls, scared of taking risks.
Why don't they like us in the village?
It's just that they didn't believe your story.
They couldn't believe a man would die for money.
They thought the Germans must be mixed up in it.
He did it for you, of course.
You won't have any more trouble.
I'll have a word.
We're having a celebration on Sunday.
Start of the hunting season.
There'll be dancing.
Come along.
Maybe.
Go on.
- Would you like an aperitif?
- Oh, no.
Didn't do that in Paris.
Couldn't afford to.
A glass of wine.
I can afford it.
I'm paid a fair wage now.
Oh!
Thank you.
It's really strange, sitting here like a lady of leisure.
Do you ever think about the future, what you'll do?
I mean, er...
You'll want to get married one day.
There's not much to choose from round here.
There's Roche, the great Resistance hero.
- And then there's you, of course.
- Ah, yes.
No.
You'll be off, back to your own sort.
Find a job and a girl who works in the civil service.
- Knows about things.
- I'd like to stay here.
Maybe we should go to that dance Roche mentioned.
I'm not too keen on those things.
You go.
I wouldn't go on my own.
But it would have been nice.
She's gone to bed.
They seemed friendly.
Maybe they don't hate us.
Of course they don't hate you.
Well, good night.
You don't have to use the back stairs.
You're not a servant.
- Terese?
Is that you?
- Yes.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I think we should eat in the dining room tonight.
There's no need to behave like Gypsies.
It's our house.
- It'll need cleaning out.
- I'll do it.
Ah, yes.
I'll get some water.
Look.
His whole life's in here.
Him in his cradle.
The christening.
That old priest's still in the village.
And here... is Jean-Louis at his first communion.
That priest again.
He called on us, let us know Chavel used to have him for dinner at Christmas.
Mother let him know there wouldn't be any more grand dinners.
What a bunch.
Mean.
Hard eyes.
No wonder he turned out the way he did.
Can you imagine them doing something human, like dancing or kissing?
Can you imagine them in love?
- How would they show love?
- I suppose they... expressed it just like you... and me.
I suppose that's your admirer Roche, come to pay his respects.
Open up, or Mother will start yelling.
Yes.
- Who is it?
- Jean-Louis Chavel.
- Who?
- Chavel.
Open the door.
It's wet out here.
Who is it?
Chavel.
- I'm sorry, can't you hear me?
- He says it's Jean-Louis Chavel.
Please.
Let him in.
Eh?
I apologise for breaking in on you like this.
- What do you want?
- Shelter.
Something to eat.
You're Chavel?
Jean-Louis Chavel?
Yes, I'm Chavel.
I knew you'd come one day.
I hope you'll allow me to...
Oh!
Erm...
I think you'd better go.
I can't.
They're looking for me.
Young men with guns who call themselves the Resistance.
- Why?
- This is a great time for settling scores.
Anyone who has an enemy can find himself labelled a collaborator.
But you have the perfect answer.
You were in a German prison, condemned to death.
They're saying that I was put there as an informer.
It was wrong of me to come here but a hunted animal heads for the place it knows as home.
I'm sorry.
I'll leave.
Yes.
You'd better go.
I had another reason for coming.
I had a message for Mademoiselle Mangeot.
From her brother.
Message?
I'm sorry, monsieur, you are?
You should know.
You were in the same prison.
I'm Jean Perrette.
Of course.
I thought I recognised your face.
Is this Chavel?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
It's Chavel.
I shouldn't have come back.
I'm...
Please forgive this intrusion.
Forgive.
You have a message from my brother?
He wanted you to know that he loved you.
He thought this was the best thing he could do for you.
I'm sorry, mademoiselle, I should have realised.
I should have known that this door would no longer be open to me.
You don't have to go.
I wouldn't turn a dog out in this rain.
You can stay.
- It's not long till morning.
- You're very kind.
You need dry clothes.
You'll find everything in your room, as you left it.
I wouldn't presume!
It's not my room any more.
Please.
Who's there?
What's all this noise?
My mother's not well.
I won't tell her who you are, she couldn't take the shock.
Who's this?
Someone who knew Michel.
Another one wanting a free meal.
And a hand-out.
I wonder that my son managed to hold on to any of his money at all.
I said he could stay tonight.
What's your name?
Er, Toupard, Madame.
Philippe Toupard.
- You knew my son?
- Yes, he talked about you a lot.
You must be very proud of him.
I'm starving.
Can you come with me, monsieur?
We have a lot to talk about.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Look, I don't know what's going on here.
All I want is... a night's shelter.
No trouble.
I was on my way to Switzerland.
I got myself into something, er, rather messy, involving the police.
I thought it wise to lie low for a couple of days.
May I see your watch a moment?
A man in prison had a watch like this.
His name was...
- Breton.
- You're the son he talked about.
I had to pull quite a few strings, use friends in high places to get him out.
You think he'd be grateful.
When he found out... he threatened to kick me out of the house.
Called me a collaborator.
Then he had a heart attack.
- What brought you here?
- Well, I remembered the story.
He'd told us about a man in prison with him, who bought his life.
You know, you were there.
I thought it was worth a try.
Jean?
!
Can you help me?
Mother's not well.
She's having her soup in her room.
Monsieur Chavel.
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of it.
- You found everything?
- In perfect order.
Fresh, dry clothes.
I am deeply grateful.
You're from Paris, yourself, Mademoiselle Mangeot, isn't that right?
My parents are from Normandy but we were born in Paris... my brother and I.
I've forgotten the bread.
You think you can get away with this?
I reckoned Chavel wouldn't have the nerve to come home.
I... decided to do it for him.
Everyone in the village will know you're not Chavel.
I had to risk it, just for the night.
I must say, I like the man's style.
Mm.
It's the best soup I've ever tasted.
All right, what's going on?
What's your game and why are you going along with my story?
To help her.
She had it in her head Chavel would show up one day.
He became an obsession with her.
I thought this would cure it.
She could, er, start living.
Hm.
Well, I think I was a bit hasty, saying I'd leave in the morning.
- I caught a look in her eye.
- You're forgetting she hates Chavel.
But I'm not Chavel.
Not the real Chavel.
I'm the Chavel she's invented for herself, not the dull reality.
- She spat in your face.
- I saw a play in Paris once, by Shakespeare, where the same thing happened.
A king murdered some woman's husband and he was practically lifting her skirt.
The actor wiped his face with his sleeve.
I remember the way he did it.
- Worked rather well.
- You should've been an actor.
When you're living off your wits, you learn to be different things to different people.
Perhaps I could learn to be Jean-Louis Chavel.
You won't get the chance.
You'll be gone by sunrise.
I'll make you.
- All this must be rather a blow to you.
- What do you mean?
Anyone with half an eye can see you're in love with her.
- You must be mad.
- No, it's perfectly reasonable.
I mean, here you are, a man who's been locked up in prison for three years.
You suddenly find yourself with a young girl.
Pretty enough, but... not quite your class.
It must be like being shipwrecked on a desert island.
You should have got in there, made a play for her tonight.
Didn't you sense the emotion that was in the air?
Thanks to me.
God, I'm tired, so tired.
Will you turn out the light, please?
Mother had an attack in the night.
She's very bad.
- Why didn't you call me?
- It wouldn't have helped.
She wants the priest.
I said everyone was tested sooner or later, everyone.
And then you know what you are.
I am a coward, just like him.
We're one of a kind.
When it came to it, I didn't pass the test either.
- Why are you tormenting yourself?
- I should have shot him.
I said I would.
You can't give a man shelter, walk away, find a gun...
- then shoot him in cold blood.
- Why not?
He did to Michel as good as.
Er, you needn't think about Chavel any longer.
He's gone.
- When?
- Earlier this morning.
I would have expected...
You told him to go.
Michel's really dead now.
Terese.
You've been so kind to me.
To us.
So understanding.
I couldn't have managed on my own.
Could you fetch the priest?
Yes, of course.
I wonder where Chavel will go?
Switzerland, probably.
When I went into Mother, she was frightened.
She wanted me to pray for her.
I knelt there, mumbling all that stuff about forgiveness of sins.
I felt terrible.
You didn't seem so anxious to forgive him before you saw him.
It's not so easy to hate a face you know as a face you imagine.
I'll fetch the priest.
I'll take the short cut over the field.
Yes?
Who is it?
What is it?
Sorry to trouble you, Father.
It's Madame Mangeot.
Oh, yes.
I was expecting something of the kind.
- It's heart trouble, I suppose?
- Yes, her daughter asked me...
Is it raining outside?
- No, it's not.
- Good.
That's good.
That's good.
Can I take that, Father?
She's breathing a little easier now.
Thank you, Father.
Send for me if you need me.
I'll go to the market.
I'll be back as quick as I can.
I'm sorry to break in on you again.
I got as far as the village and I heard about your mother.
I'm so very sorry.
- I hope it wasn't me.
- She knows nothing of you.
Oh, good.
I wouldn't want to add to her troubles.
We talked about her, that night.
The night your brother died.
The night?
- He died in the night?
- Yes, of course.
In the night.
- But Jean said he died in the morning.
- I'm afraid he was lying.
Why would he lie about that?
Why?
To make me look worse than I am, I suppose.
I mean, it is worse to let a man die after a whole night to think about it.
Yes.
He said you tried once to call it off.
Yes.
I didn't have another chance.
- They took him away.
- I knew it was in the night.
I woke suddenly with a pain.
- Why did he say that?
- You don't know this man.
He's a liar, and a cheat.
But you bought your life.
There are so many things you don't understand.
- Your brother was a sick man.
- I know.
He loved you very much.
He worried about what would happen to you, the money, Germans...
We talked about that.
He showed me your photograph.
He didn't have a photograph of me.
But he...
Oh, I know, it was a picture torn out of a newspaper.
Er, a street scene.
A beautiful girl, half-hidden in the crowd.
I suppose it reminded him of you.
People do funny things in prison.
Then he asked me what I would give for his blank slip.
What?
- He asked you?
- I know I'm a coward.
I took his offer.
If I'd been guilty of worse than that, do you think I would have dared to come back?
I don't expect you to believe me.
Why should you?
Goodbye and God bless.
There is just one thing that I think you should know.
- Thought you'd left.
- I decided to stay.
I had a long talk with the girl.
Gave her my version of what happened that night.
It's terribly unfair.
But that's life, isn't it?
She's very angry.
She wants you to clear out.
- She's letting you stay?
- She hadn't any choice.
I told her about the decree of the 17th of August.
She hadn't heard about it.
You haven't either, have you?
It makes illegal all changes of property under the German occupation if one party disputes the deal.
It's true.
I'm not making it up.
So as far as she's concerned, the place is mine.
You can't make use of it.
You're on the run, a collaborator, wanted for murder.
Ah, yes, you saw the posters.
I'll just have to lie low until it's safe to push on to Switzerland.
Things will quieten down.
Even a day's shelter is a help in my situation.
Or a week.
Anyway, it's time you left.
- You think I'll say nothing?
- I would advise you not to.
I wouldn't want the girl hurt and as you so very rightly say, I'm already wanted for murder, so I've nothing to lose.
Do you think Chavel will show up?
Is he the type?
Probably he's on his way here now.
Well, if the worst comes to the worst, I've got the gun, haven't I?
Yes, I've got the gun.
So don't get any... clever ideas.
I'd use it on the girl first.
You won't forget that, will you?
She's very upset about all the lies you told her.
- What lies?
- That her brother died in the morning.
Where is she?
With her mother.
No need to disturb her.
Just pick up your bits and pieces and clear out, quietly.
Terese, I've got to talk to you.
No more lies.
I know the truth about Michel's death.
- I told you the truth about that.
- Did you?
- He died in the night.
I felt the pain.
- Terese...
Listen, it didn't happen that way.
- Mother needs the priest.
- I'm sorry.
I'll get him.
Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum, adveniat regnum tuum fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra...
Yes, it was an easy death.
No struggle.
Of course, you know that you'll have to move out of the house.
Or she'll have to have someone come in from the village.
Yes, I know, but she's very young.
Simple sort of person.
She's seen life in Paris.
She's not just a country girl.
One place is a lot like another.
It's all a question of observation and a little wisdom.
I've spent 50 years in this backwater of a place.
And I haven't missed very much, I can tell you.
Of life, I mean.
You seem to be a man of some education.
Erm, are you telling me that this is none of my business?
- What are you saying?
- I'm talking about human nature.
I mean, you can't sit day after day as I do, listening to people, men and women, telling about themselves without getting to know something about human nature.
And she's in a state now where she might do something foolish.
- She's mourning for her mother.
- These emotions have things in common.
People talk about the sorrow there is in lust.
But you forget that sometimes there's a little lust in sorrow too.
You wouldn't want to take advantage of that, would you, my son?
Please trust me, Father.
I only want what's good for her.
That's good.
Very good.
Why can't you all leave me alone?
You are alone.
So alone.
But you need never be alone again.
You've hated me for so long but it's all over now.
You don't have to worry about anything...
- I'm so tired.
- You can rest now, Terese.
I thought I could trust Jean.
But he lied to me about Michel.
You can trust me.
Because I've told you the worst.
Everything there is to know.
I suppose so.
Terese...
- I didn't know you were there.
- Did you see the old man home?
I think it's time I told you who I am.
I am Jean-Louis Chavel.
You're mad.
The man who calls himself Chavel is a collaborator, wanted by the police for murder.
He's crazy!
I don't understand.
I don't know any more who's lying.
He's lying.
Why did you say you recognised me?
Because I was afraid to tell you who I was.
Terese, I knew you hated Chavel.
When this man came, I saw my chance to lose myself forever.
He could have all of your hatred instead.
It's more lies.
Why don't you just clear out?
Go!
What the hell are you doing?
When I was a boy, I used to play a game with a friend across the fields.
I used to take a torch like this or, if it was a sunny day, a mirror, and I would flash a message.
One message was a sort of joke.
"The Indians are attacking!"
It meant, "Come at once!"
He's just trying to fool us.
He still lives across the field, my old friend, Roche.
The Resistance man.
It's about now he goes out to his cows so he'll see this light flashing on and off.
The old code, "Come at once."
So he'll know Chavel is back.
No one else would send this message.
- You're bluffing.
- Roche saw you on the road, at the dance.
He didn't look very closely.
He saw a shabby stranger.
This message will tell him I'm back.
Drop that torch.
Tell him to drop the torch or I'll fire.
Drop the torch!
- Are you hurt?
- I'm all right.
And you really are Chavel?
Yes.
But that was another lie, about the message.
You never flashed the same way twice.
It's the last lie, Terese.
I promise you.
I had to get him to shoot.
He won't come back now.
- But he'll get away.
- No.
Roche and the others will pick him up.
You're safe now.
You are hurt.
Terese...
Terese, listen to me.
There's an envelope in my room on my table.
- Get it.
You may need it.
It will help you.
- Shh.
- In it, I've written my will.
- Gently.
- Does that matter now?
- Listen.
The decree.
Take the will to Roche.
He'll help you.
God!
Terese, the hatred, is it all gone?
That's good.
That's good, Terese.
Terese...
You'll be all right now.
[train horn]
[intercom] Due to a computer error, the food stamp program has been suspended until further notice.
Please do not apply at this time.
All applicants' report wages will now report to window P.
Thank you.
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost fourteen banks in one week.
So, well...
There's nothing available for you right now.
[man] They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful.
And they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners-- our owners!
They have us!
They control us!
They are our masters!
Wake up, they're all about you.
All around you.
[woman] Sometimes, when I watch TV,
I stop being myself.
I'm a star of a series or a-- or I have my own talk show or I'm on the news getting out of a limo going some place important.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me and they love me.
And I never, never grow old.
And I never die.
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
Maybe.
I got my own tools.
Well, this is a union job.
So, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site.
So you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Justiceville's over on Fourth Street.
They got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
I don't like nobody following me 'less I know why.
Well, I don't join up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They're serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa.
Hey, throw the ball.
Hey, Frank, how's it going?
Now you get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here's Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
Hi.
Howdy.
What do you got in that pack, tools?
Yes, sir.
Well, if you can use them we can use you.
Shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
There you go.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Want some peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Thanks.
- Some more?
Yes.
Peas?
I got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
Haven't seen them in six months.
Steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule--
He who has the gold makes the rules.
They close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy, fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience with life.
Yeah, well I'm all out.
The whole deal is like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only, everyone's out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
Okay, man, here we are.
Here we are-- now, you do what you can.
But remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money.
I just want the chance, it'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody's got their own hard times these days.
[blues harmonica]
You've always thought you couldn't wear press-on nails because of all the active things you do?
Well, if you're ready for beautiful, natural looking, easy to apply nails, three colors in seven luscious hues, just-- [static]
Our impulses are being redirected.
We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
Goddamn hacker, that's the second time tonight that asshole's cut in.
The movement was begun eight months ago by a small group of scientists who discovered quite by accident these signals being sent through-- [static]
Thing's giving me a headache.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Must took the hacker's months to figure out how to do this.
The poor and the underclass are growing.
Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
We are focused only on our own gain.
We ha--
Please understand, they are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their primary method of survival.
Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.
...they're pulling the water out of the sand like sponges.
Blow it out your ass.
Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
Oh, the church lets us use their kitchen.
Until four in the morning?
Hey, we're taking care of a lot of people here.
They are dismantling the sleeping middle class.
More and more people are becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
The revo--
Not again.
We cannot break their signal.
Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have--
Danny, I have a headache.
Me too, honey.
Can somebody please explain to me what the hell that's all about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
[choir singing "Rock of Ages"]
[singing continues]
I just checked the connection and there's nothing wrong with it.
[choir louder, continues]
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only going to jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no, that's not going to work that way.
We've been all through this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks, manufacturing Hoffman lenses until we're blue in the face.
We're just not going to reach enough people!
We've got to find new people, strong people-- people to work with us.
That's my baby.
Just leaving-- you know, your door was open.
Just wanted to close it-- didn't want no one breaking in.
Neighborhood watch.
Yeah, well, let me touch your face.
- Mmm, it's good.
- That's fine.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- Eh, you're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here, it's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I got to be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see.
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy, he's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End of the world kind of stuff.
Well, what are they doing?
You know, shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You want to know the truth?
This kind of shit happens the end of every century.
It does-- it's just people afraid to face the future.
It's all it is.
Hey, what's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab set.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy, Gilbert's in there helping them.
Look, I got a job now.
And I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody, nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
It's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy, this way.
All right, now we're going to cross the road.
It's dirt here.
[sirens blare]
Quickly, quickly!
- Go, go!
- Come on, this way-- this way.
Frank!
We know who you are.
Leave us alone!
We know you!
Don't hurt him either.
God help me!
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
Thy rod and Thy staff will--
Jesus!
Jesus!
[groaning]
Come on!
Come on in and join the party, man.
You go with them.
[helicopter blades whir]
[sirens]
Somebody start World War III?
Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
Dash and trash are back.
Out goes glitter and in comes divine excess.
The fall collection revels in freedom of expression.
Gay abandon rushes to meet the roaring '90s.
What's your problem?
I said, what's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
- Okay, how's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy, you going to pay for that or what?
Look, buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh.
[male voice] Sleep, sleep, sleep...
Can you believe it?
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, for yourself and for the baby, go!
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked, she served blue corn tortillas.
It's so dated.
[both laugh]
So depressed, I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
It's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America-- fresh, vital.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
We don't need pessimism.
There are no limits.
It figures it would be something like this.
Uh.
Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You, you're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
Oh.
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
Put them back on, formaldehyde face-- That's what we got.
That's enough out of you.
Get out or I call the cops.
Call the cops, you know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon, that--
I've got one that can see.
[mumbling into their watches]
He's a tall Caucasian male, doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
[car honking]
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
All right, suppose we settle down?
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
Tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
We got him.
Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible.
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
So you bastards die just like we do.
[siren wails]
[gasps]
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubble gum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male, 30s, long hair.
Mama don't like tattletales.
Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you, little fella?
Come to show them where I am.
Not nice.
Drop it!
I said drop it!
Beat your feet.
[tires screech]
Take it easy.
Just want a little ride out of here.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
Just keep driving.
Where am I going?
You married?
Yes.
Please don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
[sighs] Your place.
I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
[dog barks]
Hi, Holly.
Hmph.
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet.
Whoo.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but, oh, you come down hard.
Now look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
But I needed you to get away.
No, you have two guns.
You're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look lady, we're in trouble.
The whole world's in trouble.
They're all around us and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
I swear to you we're being controlled by these things!
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we got to stop them!
- All right.
I'll do whatever you want whenever you want.
Just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
Okay.
You're fighting the forces of evil that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look.
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.
Yeah, you have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look, uh,
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
[pours wine]
So, your name's Holly, right?
Holly Thompson.
It's a pretty name.
So what do you do?
Assistant program director,
Cable 54.
A TV station?
Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
No, no.
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson, 8634 Circleview Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
[sirens approach]
Frank, we're ready when you are.
Frank.
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
Not people.
You crazy son of a bitch!
- I got to show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I got a wife and kids.
So, leave me alone.
Get out of here.
[trash men argue]
Watch this.
Oh, no.
Yo.
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey, you better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother,
- Put these on.
- Hey, stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son of a bitch--
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You couldn't even save your own.
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
Not this year.
Okay.
All right.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
- Stop it!
- No!
Fuck!
Shit!
Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you,
I didn't want to be in--
You dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put 'em on.
No!
Shit.
Oh, man, I'm sorry, man.
You f--
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put 'em on!
Fuck you.
Look.
Look at them, they're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
Alley Fifth and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son of a bitch to wake up out of their dream.
[rumble]
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch.
And she's back in heat.
[police siren]
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
Starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows.
What are they, where do they come from?
Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
Look, man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we going to do?
We're going to wait.
Wait wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question.
Well, when you get some kind of master plan you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago things were different, man.
My own daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
Turned mean.
Started tearing at me.
So I ran away when I was 13.
Tried to cut me, once.
Big old razor blade.
Held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please."
Just kept moving back and forth.
Like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us.
Those things out there.
Maybe they love it.
Seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for 'em.
Going to be hell to pay.
Because I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
[spins and clicks gun cylinder]
World needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey, brothers.
There's something new going down.
They're using candy floss packages.
It's like building a park for a toxic waste dump.
They colorized it.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You're going to memorize it and then destroy the paper.
What's a safe house?
What kind of gun is that?
Hey, Frank.
- Hey.
- Hey, glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
Memorize these safe houses.
Brand new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
Even when the set is turned off.
- The brain receives the input...
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You have any trouble getting here?
No, we made it fine.
Good, the city's crawling with cops looking for us.
And most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
Creatures are trading wealth, power.
You mean people are joining up with them?
Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger.
We start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Look around the environment we live in.
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatized.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
What do these things want and why are they here?
It's in our best interests.
They're free enterprisers.
The Earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
We are like a natural resource to them-- deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
We could be pets.
We could be food.
But all we really are is livestock.
Now, we need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever see their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcast.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button and then all of a sudden-- bang!
They're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
All right, now everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy, that's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work, punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless.
And the movement's suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it trying to figure out how it happened.
Now we start spilling some blood!
[group clamors]
Wait a minute, it's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off!
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
He claims that the signal may be coming from one place.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is coming from somewhere else.
How does she know?
[crowd grumbles]
All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
And the only way we can do--
I got to go talk to someone.
If you're approached by anyone to work for these creatures, by all means accept.
Gain their trust.
Make them believe they can buy you off.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just want to--
Can we just--
Get out!
[continuous gun fire]
[siren wails]
- They're killing everybody.
- I got to find her.
- Wait a minute, man, are you crazy?
- I got to see if she's all right.
Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this thing working, we can listen in.
- Frank,
- What?
- Frank,
- What!
- Get set to shoot.
- Oh, shit!
[loud rumble]
- What was that?
- I don't know.
[woman's voice] Attention, your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway is temporary and will disappear in ten seconds.
- Get in there.
- What?
- Move.
- I don't know what's down there.
- Now!
- Oh, shit.
[woman's voice] Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Five seconds.
Four seconds.
Three seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
[intercom] If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.
What language is that?
I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
There got to be a way out.
I just hope that nobody saw us dropping in.
[radio] Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
All security stations stand down to operational--
Right.
- We have eliminated the terrorists.
- Okay.
We got 'em, we wiped them out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-team.
[distant applause]
I'm hearing something.
[applause closer]
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
You have given us entrée to the resources we need in our ongoing quest for multidimensional expansion.
And in return, the per capita income of each of you here tonight has grown, in this year alone, by an average 39o/o.
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
[crowd applause and cheers]
How you doing boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know you boys really should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I got to tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common first time we met.
[speaker] Money isn't the nicest thing in life,
- Hey, waiter, - [speaker] the only thing.
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me, where the hell are we?
Back stage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How did you get here, use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use 'em except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something?
Take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
[intercom] Attention commuters, flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
Please step in to the transmission platform.
That's where they come from.
All carry-on luggage must be held securely.
Thank you for waiting and we hope you have a pleasant trip.
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal-- bending the light or some damn thing.
But you can move from place to place, world to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together.
Believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait until you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
That's where the signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We bump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
Not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, as far as we go.
A technique called multispectral analysis.
This would allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers and camouflage--
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
Thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
[knocks on glass]
Soundproof.
- Where's that signal?
- It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal, man.
Wait boys, wait you're making a big mistake.
You made the mistake.
No, no, you got to listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you boys?
There ain't no countries anymore.
No more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything-- the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good, for a change.
And they're going to let us have it good if we just help 'em.
They're going to leave us alone.
Let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life too.
Now I know you want it-- hell, everybody does.
You do it to your own kind.
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go!
Is this the two minute break or the thirty second break?
I think it's the thirty second break.
They dropped 12, I guess we must be running long.
I think so.
We are experiencing a technical difficulty.
What the hell's going on?
Come on.
[people clamoring]
Get down!
[whispers] Now what?
Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me.
- Come on, man.
- Wait a second.
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Come on, man, I mean it.
Holly Thompson, assistant program something-or-other.
- Where is she?
- I, I... [intercom] Security alert-- sections delta and x-ray report to the fourth floor immediately.
Who's Holly?
[scream]
Oh, shit.
Well, I hate to interrupt you folks, but could someone please guide me how to get to the roof.
Security.
How do I get to the roof?
There's an elevator through there.
Turn to your left, it's at the end of the hall.
Thank you very much.
Well?
Well, there's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 9-5-0.
Lock the elevators down.
They're on the move.
[screams]
[beeping]
I hear them on the 19th floor above me.
We got you.
We're on the 21st we'll be waiting for 'em.
Go, up.
Holly!
[alarm beeps]
- Come on, come on!
[intercom] Security alert.
Intruders are here-- head for the roof.
Repeat.
Intruders--
Let's go!
[gunshot]
Frank, you and Holly clear?
[woman] I'm clear.
Are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere, you can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we will open fire.
Come inside with me.
You have ten seconds.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Fuck it.
The Oscar winners gave a press conference and "How to Buy a Sailboat" as-- [man] Gloria, you look like shit.
[man] I'm out of here.
[woman] What happened?
What's wrong?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Filmmakers like George Romero and John Carpenter have to show some restraint.
They're simply--
You're filled with lightning when you hit the road.
You're feeling that V6 power as you take control.
Nothing can stop you now.
You're moving on.
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
THEY LIVE
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years ...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star.
I have my own talk show.
Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me.
And they love me.
I never grow old, and I never die.
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do.
We've got beautiful, natural-looking, easy-to-apply nails.
There's seven different colors ...
Our impulses are being redirected.
We live in an artificially-induced state of consciousness.
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists.
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent...
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing.
Human rights are non-existent.
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent.
We are focused only on our own gain ...
They are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their method of survival.
Keep us asleep.
Keep us selfish.
- Keep us sedated.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution ...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.
Did somebody start WW III?
Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
Out goes glitter and in comes divine excess.
The warm collection revels in freedom of expression.

What's your problem?

Thank you, sir.

Thank you.
Are you going to pay for that?
THIS IS YOUR GOD
I don't want no hassle.
Pay for it or put it back.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
- There are no limits.
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil ...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way ...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ...
and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatised.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
... deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
We could be pets or food.
But all we really are is livestock.
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button ...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to ...
Can we ...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear ...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters.
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready.
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program ... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine ...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference ...
- Gloria, you look like shit.
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Film makers have to show some restraint...
What's wrong, baby?
Due to a computer error, the food stamp program has been suspended until further notice.
Please do not apply at this time.
All applicants' report wages will now report to window P.
Thank you.
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost fourteen banks in one week.
So, well...
There's nothing available for you right now.
They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful.
And they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners-- our owners!
They have us!
They control us!
They are our masters!
Wake up, they're all about you.
All around you.
Sometimes, when I watch TV,
I stop being myself.
I'm a star of a series or a-- or I have my own talk show or I'm on the news getting out of a limo going some place important.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me and they love me.
And I never, never grow old.
And I never die.
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
Maybe.
I got my own tools.
Well, this is a union job.
So, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site.
So you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Justiceville's over on Fourth Street.
They got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
I don't like nobody following me 'less I know why.
Well, I don't join up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They're serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa.
Hey, throw the ball.
Hey, Frank, how's it going?
Now you get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here's Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
Hi.
Howdy.
What do you got in that pack, tools?
Yes, sir.
Well, if you can use them we can use you.
Shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
There you go.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Want some peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Thanks.
- Some more?
Yes.
Peas?
I got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
Haven't seen them in six months.
Steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule--
He who has the gold makes the rules.
They close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy, fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience with life.
Yeah, well I'm all out.
The whole deal is like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only, everyone's out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
Okay, man, here we are.
Here we are-- now, you do what you can.
But remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money.
I just want the chance, it'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody's got their own hard times these days.
You've always thought you couldn't wear press-on nails because of all the active things you do?
Well, if you're ready for beautiful, natural looking, easy to apply nails, three colors in seven luscious hues, just--
Our impulses are being redirected.
We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
Goddamn hacker, that's the second time tonight that asshole's cut in.
The movement was begun eight months ago by a small group of scientists who discovered quite by accident these signals being sent through--
Thing's giving me a headache.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Must took the hacker's months to figure out how to do this.
The poor and the underclass are growing.
Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
We are focused only on our own gain.
We ha--
Please understand, they are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their primary method of survival.
Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.
...they're pulling the water out of the sand like sponges.
Blow it out your ass.
Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
Oh, the church lets us use their kitchen.
Until four in the morning?
Hey, we're taking care of a lot of people here.
They are dismantling the sleeping middle class.
More and more people are becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
The revo--
Not again.
We cannot break their signal.
Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have--
Danny, I have a headache.
Me too, honey.
Can somebody please explain to me what the hell that's all about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
I just checked the connection and there's nothing wrong with it.
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only going to jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no, that's not going to work that way.
We've been all through this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks, manufacturing Hoffman lenses until we're blue in the face.
We're just not going to reach enough people!
We've got to find new people, strong people-- people to work with us.
That's my baby.
Just leaving-- you know, your door was open.
Just wanted to close it-- didn't want no one breaking in.
Neighborhood watch.
Yeah, well, let me touch your face.
- Mmm, it's good.
- That's fine.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- Eh, you're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here, it's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I got to be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see.
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy, he's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End of the world kind of stuff.
Well, what are they doing?
You know, shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You want to know the truth?
This kind of shit happens the end of every century.
It does-- it's just people afraid to face the future.
It's all it is.
Hey, what's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab set.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy, Gilbert's in there helping them.
Look, I got a job now.
And I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody, nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
It's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy, this way.
All right, now we're going to cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Quickly, quickly!
- Go, go!
- Come on, this way-- this way.
Frank!
We know who you are.
Leave us alone!
We know you!
Don't hurt him either.
God help me!
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
Thy rod and Thy staff will--
Jesus!
Jesus!
Come on!
Come on in and join the party, man.
You go with them.
Somebody start World War III?
Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
Dash and trash are back.
Out goes glitter and in comes divine excess.
The fall collection revels in freedom of expression.
Gay abandon rushes to meet the roaring '90s.
What's your problem?
I said, what's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
- Okay, how's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy, you going to pay for that or what?
Look, buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh.
Sleep, sleep, sleep...
Can you believe it?
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, for yourself and for the baby, go!
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked, she served blue corn tortillas.
It's so dated.
So depressed, I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
It's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America-- fresh, vital.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
We don't need pessimism.
There are no limits.
It figures it would be something like this.
Uh.
Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You, you're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
Oh.
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
Put them back on, formaldehyde face-- That's what we got.
That's enough out of you.
Get out or I call the cops.
Call the cops, you know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon, that--
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall Caucasian male, doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
All right, suppose we settle down?
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
Tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
We got him.
Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible.
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
So you bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubble gum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male, 30s, long hair.
Mama don't like tattletales.
Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you, little fella?
Come to show them where I am.
Not nice.
Drop it!
I said drop it!
Beat your feet.
Take it easy.
Just want a little ride out of here.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
Just keep driving.
Where am I going?
You married?
Yes.
Please don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
Your place.
I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly.
Hmph.
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet.
Whoo.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but, oh, you come down hard.
Now look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
But I needed you to get away.
No, you have two guns.
You're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look lady, we're in trouble.
The whole world's in trouble.
They're all around us and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
I swear to you we're being controlled by these things!
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we got to stop them!
- All right.
I'll do whatever you want whenever you want.
Just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
Okay.
You're fighting the forces of evil that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look.
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.
Yeah, you have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look, uh,
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
So, your name's Holly, right?
Holly Thompson.
It's a pretty name.
So what do you do?
Assistant program director,
Cable 54.
A TV station?
Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
No, no.
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson, 8634 Circleview Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank, we're ready when you are.
Frank.
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
Not people.
You crazy son of a bitch!
- I got to show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I got a wife and kids.
So, leave me alone.
Get out of here.
Watch this.
Oh, no.
Yo.
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey, you better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother,
- Put these on.
- Hey, stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son of a bitch--
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You couldn't even save your own.
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
Not this year.
Okay.
All right.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
- Stop it!
- No!
Fuck!
Shit!
Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you,
I didn't want to be in--
You dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put 'em on.
No!
Shit.
Oh, man, I'm sorry, man.
You f--
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put 'em on!
Fuck you.
Look.
Look at them, they're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
Alley Fifth and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son of a bitch to wake up out of their dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch.
And she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
Starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows.
What are they, where do they come from?
Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
Look, man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we going to do?
We're going to wait.
Wait wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question.
Well, when you get some kind of master plan you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago things were different, man.
My own daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
Turned mean.
Started tearing at me.
So I ran away when I was 13.
Tried to cut me, once.
Big old razor blade.
Held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please."
Just kept moving back and forth.
Like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us.
Those things out there.
Maybe they love it.
Seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for 'em.
Going to be hell to pay.
Because I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
World needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey, brothers.
There's something new going down.
They're using candy floss packages.
It's like building a park for a toxic waste dump.
They colorized it.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You're going to memorize it and then destroy the paper.
What's a safe house?
What kind of gun is that?
Hey, Frank.
- Hey.
- Hey, glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
Memorize these safe houses.
Brand new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
Even when the set is turned off.
- The brain receives the input...
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You have any trouble getting here?
No, we made it fine.
Good, the city's crawling with cops looking for us.
And most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
Creatures are trading wealth, power.
You mean people are joining up with them?
Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger.
We start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Look around the environment we live in.
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatized.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
What do these things want and why are they here?
It's in our best interests.
They're free enterprisers.
The Earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
We are like a natural resource to them-- deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
We could be pets.
We could be food.
But all we really are is livestock.
Now, we need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever see their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcast.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button and then all of a sudden-- bang!
They're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
All right, now everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy, that's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work, punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless.
And the movement's suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it trying to figure out how it happened.
Now we start spilling some blood!
Wait a minute, it's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off!
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
He claims that the signal may be coming from one place.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is coming from somewhere else.
How does she know?
All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
And the only way we can do--
I got to go talk to someone.
If you're approached by anyone to work for these creatures, by all means accept.
Gain their trust.
Make them believe they can buy you off.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just want to--
Can we just--
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I got to find her.
- Wait a minute, man, are you crazy?
- I got to see if she's all right.
Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this thing working, we can listen in.
- Frank,
- What?
- Frank,
- What!
- Get set to shoot.
- Oh, shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Attention, your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway is temporary and will disappear in ten seconds.
- Get in there.
- What?
- Move.
- I don't know what's down there.
- Now!
- Oh, shit.
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Five seconds.
Four seconds.
Three seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.
What language is that?
I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
There got to be a way out.
I just hope that nobody saw us dropping in.
Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
All security stations stand down to operational--
Right.
- We have eliminated the terrorists.
- Okay.
We got 'em, we wiped them out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-team.
I'm hearing something.
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
You have given us entrÃ©e to the resources we need in our ongoing quest for multidimensional expansion.
And in return, the per capita income of each of you here tonight has grown, in this year alone, by an average 39o/o.
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
How you doing boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know you boys really should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I got to tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common first time we met.
Money isn't the nicest thing in life,
- Hey, waiter, the only thing.
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me, where the hell are we?
Back stage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How did you get here, use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use 'em except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something?
Take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
Attention commuters, flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
Please step in to the transmission platform.
That's where they come from.
All carry-on luggage must be held securely.
Thank you for waiting and we hope you have a pleasant trip.
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal-- bending the light or some damn thing.
But you can move from place to place, world to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together.
Believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait until you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
That's where the signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We bump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
Not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, as far as we go.
A technique called multispectral analysis.
This would allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers and camouflage--
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
Thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
Soundproof.
- Where's that signal?
- It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal, man.
Wait boys, wait you're making a big mistake.
You made the mistake.
No, no, you got to listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you boys?
There ain't no countries anymore.
No more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything-- the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good, for a change.
And they're going to let us have it good if we just help 'em.
They're going to leave us alone.
Let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life too.
Now I know you want it-- hell, everybody does.
You do it to your own kind.
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go!
Is this the two minute break or the thirty second break?
I think it's the thirty second break.
They dropped 12, I guess we must be running long.
I think so.
We are experiencing a technical difficulty.
What the hell's going on?
Come on.
Get down!
Now what?
Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me.
- Come on, man.
- Wait a second.
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Come on, man, I mean it.
Holly Thompson, assistant program something-or-other.
- Where is she?
- I, I...
Security alert-- sections delta and x-ray report to the fourth floor immediately.
Who's Holly?
Oh, shit.
Well, I hate to interrupt you folks, but could someone please guide me how to get to the roof.
Security.
How do I get to the roof?
There's an elevator through there.
Turn to your left, it's at the end of the hall.
Thank you very much.
Well?
Well, there's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 9-5-0.
Lock the elevators down.
They're on the move.
I hear them on the 19th floor above me.
We got you.
We're on the 21st we'll be waiting for 'em.
Go, up.
Holly!
- Come on, come on!
Security alert.
Intruders are here-- head for the roof.
Repeat.
Intruders--
Let's go!
Frank, you and Holly clear?
I'm clear.
Are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere, you can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we will open fire.
Come inside with me.
You have ten seconds.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Fuck it.
The Oscar winners gave a press conference and "How to Buy a Sailboat" as--
Gloria, you look like shit.
I'm out of here.
What happened?
What's wrong?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Filmmakers like George Romero and John Carpenter have to show some restraint.
They're simply--
You're filled with lightning when you hit the road.
You're feeling that V6 power as you take control.
Nothing can stop you now.
You're moving on.
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
(Train approaches)
(Train horn blares)
(Tannoy) 'Due to a computer error, 'the food stamp programme has been suspended until further notice.
'Please do not apply at this time.
'All applicants for work wages now report to window D.
'Thank you.'
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
So, er ...
There's nothing available for you right now.
(Preacher) They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners!
Our owners!
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up!
They're all about you, all around you.
(TV) 'Sometimes when I watch TV, I stop being myself, 'and I'm a star of a series or I have my own talk show, 'or I'm on the news getting out of a limo, going someplace important.
'All I ever have to do is be famous.
'People watch me, and they love me.
'And I'll never, never grow old, 'and I'll never die.'
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
(Indistinct chattering, laughing)
So ...
Er, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site, so you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Chesterfield's over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
(Car horn)
(Car horn)
I don't like nobody following me unless I know why.
Well, I don't turn up with anybody till I see where he's going.
They'll be serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa!
Hey Frank, how's it going?
You may get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What you got in that pack?
Tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, we can use you.
The shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
(Indistinct chattering)
There you go!
Howdy!
- Peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Some more?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule.
"He who has the gold makes the rules."
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience.
Yeah, well, I'm all out.
The whole deal's like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
OK, man, here we are.
Here we are.
Now, you do what you can, but remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how are you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money, I just want a chance.
It'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times these days.

Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
'The movement was begun eight months ago 'by a small group of scientists who discovered — quite by accident — 'these signals being sent through ...'
- That thing's giving me a headache.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
The church lets us use their kitchen.
Till four in the morning?
(Chuckles) Hey, we take care of a lot of people here.
'They are dismantling the sleeping middle-class.
'More and more people are becoming poor.
'We are their cattle.
'We are being bred for slavery.'
- Not again!
- 'We cannot break their signal.
'Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
'The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have ...'
- Billy, I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
Could somebody please explain to me what the hell all that's about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
(♪ Gospel choir singing)
(Gilbert) And there's nothing wrong with it.
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only gonna jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no ... it's not gonna work that way.
We've been all through this!
We have no other choice.
(Clattering)
Robbing banks.
Manufacturing Hoffman lenses till we're blue in the face.
We're just not gonna reach enough people!
We gotta find new people, strong people who'll work with us.
That's my baby.
Oh!
Just leaving, you know ...
Your door was open.
Just wanted to close it.
Didn't want no one breaking in.
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah ...
Now let me touch your face.
- That's fine.
- Mm-hmm, good.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- You're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
It's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I gotta be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see!
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence is what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy who's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- Well, what are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You wanna know the truth?
This kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It does.
It's just people afraid to face the future, that's all it is.
(Frank) Hey!
What's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab setup.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy Gilbert's in there helping them.
I got a job now and I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy.
This way.
All right.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
(Sirens wailing)
Quickly!
Quickly!
(Chattering in Spanish)
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, this way.
This way.
(Sirens wailing)
(Indistinct chattering, shouting)
Frank!
(Man) We know who you are!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
We know you.

Come on!
Come on!
Come on in and join the party, man.
You go with him.
Somebody start World War III?
'Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
'Dash and trash are back.

(Tyres screech)
(Shopkeeper) Thank you.
(♪ Humming)
What's your problem?
I said, what's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
- OK.
How's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
(Shopkeeper) Hey, buddy.
You gonna pay for that or what?
Look buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh!

She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, "For yourself and for the baby, go!"
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked!
She served blue corn tortillas!
So dated!
(Laughing)
I'm so depressed.
I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.
(TV) 'The feeling is definitely there.
'It's a new morning in America.

'We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
'It really boils down to our ability to accept.
'We don't need pessimism.
'There are no limits.'
It figures it would be something like this.
Ugh!
Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
(Gasps)
You?
You're OK.
This one?
Real fucking ugly!
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
- Put them on ... formaldehyde face!
- That's enough out of you!
You get out, or I call the cops.
Call the cops?
You know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
(Indistinct chattering)
He's a tall, Caucasian male that doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
(Car horn)
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Huh ...
All right, suppose we settle down.
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
The tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
- We got him.
- Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible!
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet, so we can talk this over.
So, you bastards die just like we do.
(Siren wailing)
(Tyres screech)
(Woman gasps) My goodness!
(Indistinct chattering)
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubble gum.
(Screaming)
(Man) Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male, thirties.
Long hair.
Mama don't like tattletales.
Wearing sunglasses.
(Siren wailing)
(Tyres screech)
(Whirring)
'And who are you, little fella?
'Come to show them where I am.
'Not nice!
'
Drop it!
I said, drop it!
Beat your feet, man.
Take it easy.
I just want a little ride out of here.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
Please, don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
(Man) Hi, Holly!
Hmm!
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet. (Chuckles)
Whoo!
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but you come down hard.
Look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
No!
You have two guns, you're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look, lady, we're in trouble.
They're all around us, and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
We're being controlled by these things.
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we gotta stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, whenever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you!
OK.
You're fighting the forces of evil ... that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look!
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
You have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look ...
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
So, your name's Holly?
Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
So, what do you do?
Assistant programme director.
Cable 54.
- A TV station?
- Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
(Dog barks)
No, no ...
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
(Siren wailing)
(Groans) Ugh ...
(Helicopter approaches)
(Indistinct shouting)
(Man) Frank, I'm ready when you are!
(John) Frank?
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
- How many people did you kill?
- Not people.
You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
- I gotta show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I've got a wife and kids, so leave me alone!
Get out of here!
(Man 1) Oh, come on, Frank ... (Man 2) Hey, move your ass!
(Siren wailing)
(Man 1) I ain't gonna be picking up nothing!
(Man 2) Yeah, you wait until I tell the manager!
(Man 1) Yeah well, then I'm gonna show him.
(Man 2) Watch it!
Oh, no!
No!
(Groaning)
Yo!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey!
You'd better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Hey!
Stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son-of-a ...
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save your own!
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put these on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- OK.
All right.
- OK.
- Come on.
Come on.
- I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
- No!
Oh, fuck!
- (Groans) Shit!
- Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you I didn't want to be involved.
You dirty motherfucker!
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
Fuck it!
(Roars)
Man, I'm sorry.
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put them on!
Fuck you!
(Gasping)
Look!
Look at them.
They're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son-of-a-bitch to wake up out of their dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ... and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
It starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows?
What are they?
Where do they come from?
- Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
- Look man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna wait.
- Wait?
Wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question!
Well, when you get some kind of master plan, you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We gotta find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different, man.
My old Daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean and started tearing at me.
That's why I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once.
Big old razor blade.
He held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please ..."
He just kept moving back and forth ... like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for them.
There's going to be hell to pay.
'Cause I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
(Man) Hey, brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging.
It's like building a park over a toxic waste dump.
Do you see that?
My dad had one like that.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You've gotta memorise them and then destroy the paper.
What's a 'safe house'?
- Hey, Frank!
- Hey.
Hey!
Glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
(Gilbert) Memorise these safe houses.
Memorise these safe houses.
Brand-new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
'There is a signal broadcast every second of every day 'through our television sets, 'even when the set is turned off.'
Hey!
- Any trouble getting here?
- No, we made it fine.
Good.
The city is crawling with cops looking for us.
Most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
The creatures are trading wealth, power.
- People are joining up with them?
- Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger, we start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
(TV) 'Look around at the environment we live in.
'Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons and methane have increased since 1958.
'Earth is being acclimatised.
'They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.'
What do these things want, and why are they here?
It's in their best interests.
They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet — their Third World.
'We are like a natural resource to them.
'Deplete the planet, move on to another.
'They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
'We could be pets.
We could be food.
'But all we really are is livestock.'
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button, and all of a sudden ... bang!
They're gone.
- I'm trying to figure it out.
- All right now, everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy.
That's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So, we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work.
Punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless, and the movement is suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it, trying to figure out how it happened.
- Now we start spilling some blood.
- (All) Yeah!
- No!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
It's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So, what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off.
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
Now, he claims the signal may be coming from one place.
(Holly) KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal's coming from somewhere else.
(Gilbert) All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
I gotta go talk to someone.
(Gilbert continues talking)
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just wanted to ...
Can we just ...?
Get out!
Get out of here!
Round the back!
(Indistinct shouting)
Oh, no!
- Come on, just get out!
- Go, go, go ...
Keep moving, people.
(Gun shots)
(Screams)
They're killing everybody.
- I gotta to find her.
- Wait a minute.
Are you crazy?
- I gotta see if she's all right.
- Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Get set to sweat.
- Oh, shit!
(Zooming)
- What was that?
- I don't know.
(Crackling)
(Tannoy) 'Attention!
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
'This entry way is temporary and will disappear ...'
- Get in there!
Move!
- What?
- We don't know what's down there.
- Now!
'Eight seconds.
'Seven seconds.
'Six seconds.
'Five seconds.
'Four seconds.
'Three seconds.
'Two seconds.
'One second.
'If you need assistance in finding your destination, 'bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.'
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I just hope nobody saw us drop in.
(Tannoy) 'Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
'All security stations stand down to operational status.
- 'We have eliminated the terrorists.'
- OK!
- We got them!
We wiped them out!
- All right!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
(Applause)
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial — both for ourselves and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us entree to the resources we need in our on-going quest for multi-dimensional expansion.
And in return, the per-capita income of each of you here tonight has grown.
And this year alone by an average of 39%.
Isn't it lovely?
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
(Applause)
How you doing, boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know, you boys really should have dressed for the party now that you can afford it.
I gotta tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common the first time we met.
Hey, waiter!
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me ...
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How'd you get here?
Use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use them except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something, take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
(Tannoy) 'Attention, commuters.
'Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
'Please step to the transmission platform.'
That's where they come from.
'All carry-on luggage must be held securely.'
'Thank you for waiting, and we hope you have a pleasant trip.'
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal, bending the light or some damn thing, but you can move from place to place.
World to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing here works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
Master signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We pump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
I'm not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, that's as far as we go.
(TV presenter) '... multi-spectral analysis.
'This will allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers ...'
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much of a problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
I thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorisation cards?
Right here.
(Groaning)
Watch the door.
(Wailing)
Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal.
Wait boys, wait, you're making a big mistake.
- You made the mistake.
- No, you gotta listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you, boys?
There ain't no countries anymore, no more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything, the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good for a change?
And they're gonna let us have it good if we help just them.
They're gonna leave us alone, let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
Now, I know you want it.
Hell, everybody does.
You'd do it to your own kind?
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Is this the two-minute break or the 30-second break?
I think it's the 30-second break, but I don't know.
- I guess we must be running long.
- I think so.
(TV) 'We are experiencing technical difficulties.'
What the hell is going on?
Come on.
(Indistinct shouting)
Oh, my God!
No!
Get down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
- Excuse me!
- Come on, man!
Wait a sec!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Come on, man, I mean it!
Holly Thompson.
Assistant programme something or other.
Where is she?
(Tannoy) 'Security alert.
'Sections Delta and X-Ray report to the fourth floor immediately.'
Who's Holly?
Oh, shit!
Well, I hate to interrupt you, folks, but could someone please tell me how to get to the roof?
- Security!
- Uh-uh-uh!
How do I get to the roof?
There's an elevator through there.
Turn to your left, it's at the end of the hall.
Thank you very much.
- Well?
- There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
Lock the elevators down.
They're on the move.
(Screaming)
(Groaning)
(Beeping)
I hear them on the 19th floor above me.
Got you.
We're on the 21st.
We'll be waiting for them.
Go!

Holly!
- Come on!
Come on!
- Hey!

Intruders in here are heading for the roof.
'Repeat.
Intruders ...'
Let's go!

Are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.

(Man) Gloria, you look like shit.
I'm out of here!
- (Woman) What happened?
- What's wrong?
'All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me
'I'm fed up with it.

They're simply ...'

'All applicants for work wages now report to window D.
'Thank you.'
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
So, er ...
There's nothing available for you right now.
They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners!
Our owners!
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up!
They're all about you, all around you.
'Sometimes when I watch TV, I stop being myself, 'and I'm a star of a series or I have my own talk show, 'or I'm on the news getting out of a limo, going someplace important.
'All I ever have to do is be famous.
'People watch me, and they love me.
'And I'll never, never grow old, 'and I'll never die.'
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
So ...
Er, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site, so you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Chesterfield's over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
I don't like nobody following me unless I know why.
Well, I don't turn up with anybody till I see where he's going.
They'll be serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa!
Hey Frank, how's it going?
You may get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What you got in that pack?
Tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, we can use you.
The shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
There you go!
Howdy!
- Peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Some more?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule.
"He who has the gold makes the rules."
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience.
Yeah, well, I'm all out.
The whole deal's like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
OK, man, here we are.
Here we are.
Now, you do what you can, but remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how are you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money, I just want a chance.
It'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times these days.
'And you've always thought you couldn't wear press-on nails 'because of all the active things you do?
'Well, if you're ready for beautiful, natural-looking, easy-to-apply nails, recoloured in seven luscious hues, 'just ...'
'Our impulses are being redirected.
'We are living in an artificially-induced state of consciousness 'that resembles sleep.'
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
'The movement was begun eight months ago 'by a small group of scientists who discovered — quite by accident — 'these signals being sent through ...'
- That thing's giving me a headache.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
Must have took the hacker months to figure out how to do this.
'The poor and the under-class are growing.
'Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
'They have created a repressive society, 'and we are their unwitting accomplices.
'Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
'We have been lulled into a trance.
'They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
'We are focused only on our own gain.
'We ...
'Please understand, 'they are safe as long as they are not discovered.
'That is their primary method of survival.
'Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.'
Blow it out of your ass!
Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
The church lets us use their kitchen.
Till four in the morning?
Hey, we take care of a lot of people here.
'They are dismantling the sleeping middle-class.
'More and more people are becoming poor.
'We are their cattle.
'We are being bred for slavery.'
- Not again!
- 'We cannot break their signal.
'Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
'The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have ...'
- Billy, I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
Could somebody please explain to me what the hell all that's about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
And there's nothing wrong with it.
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only gonna jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no ... it's not gonna work that way.
We've been all through this!
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Manufacturing Hoffman lenses till we're blue in the face.
We're just not gonna reach enough people!
We gotta find new people, strong people who'll work with us.
That's my baby.
Oh!
Just leaving, you know ...
Your door was open.
Just wanted to close it.
Didn't want no one breaking in.
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah ...
Now let me touch your face.
- That's fine.
- Mm-hmm, good.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- You're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
It's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I gotta be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see!
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence is what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy who's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- Well, what are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You wanna know the truth?
This kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It does.
It's just people afraid to face the future, that's all it is.
Hey!
What's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab setup.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy Gilbert's in there helping them.
I got a job now and I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy.
This way.
All right.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Quickly!
Quickly!
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, this way.
This way.
Frank!
We know who you are!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
We know you.
God help me!
Help me, Jesus!
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
"Thy rod and thy staff will ..."
Jesus!
Jesus!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on in and join the party, man.
You go with him.

Thank you.
What's your problem?
I said, what's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
- OK.
How's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy.
You gonna pay for that or what?
Look buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh!
'Sleep ...
'Sleep ...
'Sleep ...

Can you believe it?
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, "For yourself and for the baby, go!"
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked!
She served blue corn tortillas!
So dated!
I'm so depressed.
I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.
'The feeling is definitely there.
'It's a new morning in America.
'Fresh.
Vital.
'The old cynicism is gone.
'We have faith in our leaders.
'We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
'It really boils down to our ability to accept.
'We don't need pessimism.
'There are no limits.'
It figures it would be something like this.
Ugh!
Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You?
You're OK.
This one?
Real fucking ugly!
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
- Put them on ... formaldehyde face!
- That's enough out of you!
You get out, or I call the cops.
Call the cops?
You know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male that doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Huh ...
All right, suppose we settle down.
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
The tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
- We got him.
- Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible!
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet, so we can talk this over.
So, you bastards die just like we do.
My goodness!
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubble gum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male, thirties.
Long hair.
Mama don't like tattletales.
Wearing sunglasses.
'And who are you, little fella?
'Come to show them where I am.
'Not nice!
'
Drop it!
I said, drop it!
Beat your feet, man.
Take it easy.
I just want a little ride out of here.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
Please, don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
Hmm!
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet.
Whoo!
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but you come down hard.
Look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
No!
You have two guns, you're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look, lady, we're in trouble.
They're all around us, and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
We're being controlled by these things.
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we gotta stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, whenever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you!
OK.
You're fighting the forces of evil ... that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look!
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
You have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look ...
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
So, your name's Holly?
Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
So, what do you do?
Assistant programme director.
Cable 54.
- A TV station?
- Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
No, no ...
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Ugh ...
Frank, I'm ready when you are!
Frank?
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
- How many people did you kill?
- Not people.
You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
- I gotta show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I've got a wife and kids, so leave me alone!
Get out of here!
Oh, come on, Frank ...
Hey, move your ass!
I ain't gonna be picking up nothing!
Yeah, you wait until I tell the manager!
Yeah well, then I'm gonna show him.
Watch it!
Oh, no!
No!
Yo!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey!
You'd better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Hey!
Stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son-of-a ...
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save your own!
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put these on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- OK.
All right.
- OK.
- Come on.
Come on.
- I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
- No!
Oh, fuck!
- Shit!
- Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you I didn't want to be involved.
You dirty motherfucker!
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
Fuck it!
Man, I'm sorry.
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
Look at them.
They're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son-of-a-bitch to wake up out of their dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ... and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
It starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows?
What are they?
Where do they come from?
- Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
- Look man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna wait.
- Wait?
Wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question!
Well, when you get some kind of master plan, you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We gotta find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different, man.
My old Daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean and started tearing at me.
That's why I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once.
Big old razor blade.
He held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please ..."
He just kept moving back and forth ... like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for them.
There's going to be hell to pay.
'Cause I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey, brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging.
It's like building a park over a toxic waste dump.
Do you see that?
My dad had one like that.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You've gotta memorise them and then destroy the paper.
What's a 'safe house'?
- Hey, Frank!
- Hey.
Hey!
Glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
Memorise these safe houses.
Memorise these safe houses.
Brand-new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
'There is a signal broadcast every second of every day 'through our television sets, 'even when the set is turned off.'
Hey!
- Any trouble getting here?
- No, we made it fine.
Good.
The city is crawling with cops looking for us.
Most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
The creatures are trading wealth, power.
- People are joining up with them?
- Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger, we start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
'Look around at the environment we live in.
'Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons and methane have increased since 1958.
'Earth is being acclimatised.
'They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.'
What do these things want, and why are they here?
It's in their best interests.
They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet — their Third World.
'We are like a natural resource to them.
'Deplete the planet, move on to another.
'They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
'We could be pets.
We could be food.
'But all we really are is livestock.'
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button, and all of a sudden ... bang!
They're gone.
- I'm trying to figure it out.
- All right now, everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy.
That's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So, we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work.
Punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless, and the movement is suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it, trying to figure out how it happened.
- Now we start spilling some blood.
- Yeah!
- No!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
It's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So, what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off.
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
Now, he claims the signal may be coming from one place.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal's coming from somewhere else.
All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
I gotta go talk to someone.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just wanted to ...
Can we just ...?
Get out!
Get out of here!
Round the back!
Oh, no!
- Come on, just get out!
- Go, go, go ...
Keep moving, people.
They're killing everybody.
- I gotta to find her.
- Wait a minute.
Are you crazy?
- I gotta see if she's all right.
- Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Get set to sweat.
- Oh, shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
'Attention!
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
'This entry way is temporary and will disappear ...'
- Get in there!
Move!
- What?
- We don't know what's down there.
- Now!
'Eight seconds.
'Seven seconds.
'Six seconds.
'Five seconds.
'Four seconds.
'Three seconds.
'Two seconds.
'One second.
'If you need assistance in finding your destination, 'bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.'
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I just hope nobody saw us drop in.
'Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
'All security stations stand down to operational status.
- 'We have eliminated the terrorists.'
- OK!
- We got them!
We wiped them out!
- All right!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial — both for ourselves and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us entree to the resources we need in our on-going quest for multi-dimensional expansion.
And in return, the per-capita income of each of you here tonight has grown.
And this year alone by an average of 39%.
Isn't it lovely?
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
How you doing, boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know, you boys really should have dressed for the party now that you can afford it.
I gotta tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common the first time we met.
Hey, waiter!
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me ...
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How'd you get here?
Use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use them except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something, take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
'Attention, commuters.
'Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
'Please step to the transmission platform.'
That's where they come from.
'All carry-on luggage must be held securely.'
'Thank you for waiting, and we hope you have a pleasant trip.'
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal, bending the light or some damn thing, but you can move from place to place.
World to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing here works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
Master signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We pump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
I'm not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, that's as far as we go.
'... multi-spectral analysis.
'This will allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers ...'
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much of a problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
I thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorisation cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal.
Wait boys, wait, you're making a big mistake.
- You made the mistake.
- No, you gotta listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you, boys?
There ain't no countries anymore, no more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything, the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good for a change?
And they're gonna let us have it good if we help just them.
They're gonna leave us alone, let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
Now, I know you want it.
Hell, everybody does.
You'd do it to your own kind?
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
THEY LIVE
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years ...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star
I have my own talk show Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo
All I ever have to do is be famous People watch me
And they love me
I never grow old, and I never die
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do
We've got beautiful, natural-Iooking, easy-to-apply nails
There's seven different colors
Our impulses are being redirected
We live in an artifiicially-induced state of consciousness
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing Human rights are non-existent
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness
We have been lulled into a trance They have made us indifferent
We are focused only on our own gain
They are safe as long as they are not discovered
That is their method of survival Keep us asleep Keep us selfiish
- Keep us sedated
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor
We are their cattle We are being bred for slavery
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal
The signal must be shut off at the source
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution ...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is defiinitely there It's a new morning in America
The old cynicism is gone We have faith in our leaders
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all
It really boils down to our ability to accept
- There are no limits
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil ...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way ...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ...
and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958 Earth is being acclimatised
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
deplete the planet, move on to another
They want benign indifference We could be pets or food
But all we really are is livestock
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button ...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to ...
Can we ...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear ...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program ... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine ...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference
- Gloria, you look like shit
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me
I'm fed up with it Film makers have to show some restraint
What's wrong, baby?
[train horn]
[intercom] Due to a computer error, the food stamp program has been suspended until further notice.
Please do not apply at this time.
All applicants' report wages will now report to window P.
Thank you.
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost fourteen banks in one week.
So, well...
There's nothing available for you right now.
[man] They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful.
And they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners-- our owners!
They have us!
They control us!
They are our masters!
Wake up, they're all about you.
All around you.
[woman] Sometimes, when I watch TV,
I stop being myself.
I'm a star of a series or a-- or I have my own talk show or I'm on the news getting out of a limo going some place important.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me and they love me.
And I never, never grow old.
And I never die.
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
Maybe.
I got my own tools.
Well, this is a union job.
So, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site.
So you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Justiceville's over on Fourth Street.
They got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
I don't like nobody following me 'less I know why.
Well, I don't join up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They're serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa.
Hey, throw the ball.
Hey, Frank, how's it going?
Now you get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here's Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
Hi.
Howdy.
What do you got in that pack, tools?
Yes, sir.
Well, if you can use them we can use you.
Shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
There you go.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Want some peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Thanks.
- Some more?
Yes.
Peas?
I got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
Haven't seen them in six months.
Steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule--
He who has the gold makes the rules.
They close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy, fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience with life.
Yeah, well I'm all out.
The whole deal is like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only, everyone's out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
Okay, man, here we are.
Here we are-- now, you do what you can.
But remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money.
I just want the chance, it'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody's got their own hard times these days.
[blues harmonica]
You've always thought you couldn't wear press-on nails because of all the active things you do?
Well, if you're ready for beautiful, natural looking, easy to apply nails, three colors in seven luscious hues, just-- [static]
Our impulses are being redirected.
We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
Goddamn hacker, that's the second time tonight that asshole's cut in.
The movement was begun eight months ago by a small group of scientists who discovered quite by accident these signals being sent through-- [static]
Thing's giving me a headache.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Must took the hacker's months to figure out how to do this.
The poor and the underclass are growing.
Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
We are focused only on our own gain.
We ha--
Please understand, they are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their primary method of survival.
Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.
...they're pulling the water out of the sand like sponges.
Blow it out your ass.
Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
Oh, the church lets us use their kitchen.
Until four in the morning?
Hey, we're taking care of a lot of people here.
They are dismantling the sleeping middle class.
More and more people are becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
The revo--
Not again.
We cannot break their signal.
Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have--
Danny, I have a headache.
Me too, honey.
Can somebody please explain to me what the hell that's all about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
[choir singing "Rock of Ages"]
[singing continues]
I just checked the connection and there's nothing wrong with it.
[choir louder, continues]
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only going to jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no, that's not going to work that way.
We've been all through this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks, manufacturing Hoffman lenses until we're blue in the face.
We're just not going to reach enough people!
We've got to find new people, strong people-- people to work with us.
That's my baby.
Just leaving-- you know, your door was open.
Just wanted to close it-- didn't want no one breaking in.
Neighborhood watch.
Yeah, well, let me touch your face.
- Mmm, it's good.
- That's fine.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- Eh, you're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here, it's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I got to be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see.
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy, he's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End of the world kind of stuff.
Well, what are they doing?
You know, shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You want to know the truth?
This kind of shit happens the end of every century.
It does-- it's just people afraid to face the future.
It's all it is.
Hey, what's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab set.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy, Gilbert's in there helping them.
Look, I got a job now.
And I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody, nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
It's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy, this way.
All right, now we're going to cross the road.
It's dirt here.
[sirens blare]
Quickly, quickly!
- Go, go!
- Come on, this way-- this way.
Frank!
We know who you are.
Leave us alone!
We know you!
Don't hurt him either.
God help me!
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
Thy rod and Thy staff will--
Jesus!
Jesus!
[groaning]
Come on!
Come on in and join the party, man.
You go with them.
[helicopter blades whir]
[sirens]
Somebody start World War III?
Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
Dash and trash are back.
Out goes glitter and in comes divine excess.
The fall collection revels in freedom of expression.
Gay abandon rushes to meet the roaring '90s.
What's your problem?
I said, what's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
- Okay, how's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy, you going to pay for that or what?
Look, buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh.
[male voice] Sleep, sleep, sleep...
Can you believe it?
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, for yourself and for the baby, go!
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked, she served blue corn tortillas.
It's so dated.
[both laugh]
So depressed, I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
It's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America-- fresh, vital.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
We don't need pessimism.
There are no limits.
It figures it would be something like this.
Uh.
Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You, you're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
Oh.
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
Put them back on, formaldehyde face-- That's what we got.
That's enough out of you.
Get out or I call the cops.
Call the cops, you know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon, that--
I've got one that can see.
[mumbling into their watches]
He's a tall Caucasian male, doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
[car honking]
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
All right, suppose we settle down?
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
Tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
We got him.
Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible.
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
So you bastards die just like we do.
[siren wails]
[gasps]
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubble gum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male, 30s, long hair.
Mama don't like tattletales.
Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you, little fella?
Come to show them where I am.
Not nice.
Drop it!
I said drop it!
Beat your feet.
[tires screech]
Take it easy.
Just want a little ride out of here.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
Just keep driving.
Where am I going?
You married?
Yes.
Please don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
[sighs] Your place.
I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
[dog barks]
Hi, Holly.
Hmph.
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet.
Whoo.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but, oh, you come down hard.
Now look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
But I needed you to get away.
No, you have two guns.
You're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look lady, we're in trouble.
The whole world's in trouble.
They're all around us and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
I swear to you we're being controlled by these things!
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we got to stop them!
- All right.
I'll do whatever you want whenever you want.
Just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
Okay.
You're fighting the forces of evil that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look.
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.
Yeah, you have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look, uh,
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
[pours wine]
So, your name's Holly, right?
Holly Thompson.
It's a pretty name.
So what do you do?
Assistant program director,
Cable 54.
A TV station?
Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
No, no.
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson, 8634 Circleview Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
[sirens approach]
Frank, we're ready when you are.
Frank.
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
Not people.
You crazy son of a bitch!
- I got to show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I got a wife and kids.
So, leave me alone.
Get out of here.
[trash men argue]
Watch this.
Oh, no.
Yo.
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey, you better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother,
- Put these on.
- Hey, stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son of a bitch--
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You couldn't even save your own.
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
Not this year.
Okay.
All right.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
- Stop it!
- No!
Fuck!
Shit!
Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you,
I didn't want to be in--
You dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put 'em on.
No!
Shit.
Oh, man, I'm sorry, man.
You f--
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put 'em on!
Fuck you.
Look.
Look at them, they're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
Alley Fifth and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son of a bitch to wake up out of their dream.
[rumble]
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch.
And she's back in heat.
[police siren]
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
Starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows.
What are they, where do they come from?
Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
Look, man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we going to do?
We're going to wait.
Wait wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question.
Well, when you get some kind of master plan you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago things were different, man.
My own daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
Turned mean.
Started tearing at me.
So I ran away when I was 13.
Tried to cut me, once.
Big old razor blade.
Held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please."
Just kept moving back and forth.
Like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us.
Those things out there.
Maybe they love it.
Seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for 'em.
Going to be hell to pay.
Because I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
[spins and clicks gun cylinder]
World needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey, brothers.
There's something new going down.
They're using candy floss packages.
It's like building a park for a toxic waste dump.
They colorized it.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You're going to memorize it and then destroy the paper.
What's a safe house?
What kind of gun is that?
Hey, Frank.
- Hey.
- Hey, glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
Memorize these safe houses.
Brand new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
Even when the set is turned off.
- The brain receives the input...
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You have any trouble getting here?
No, we made it fine.
Good, the city's crawling with cops looking for us.
And most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
Creatures are trading wealth, power.
You mean people are joining up with them?
Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger.
We start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Look around the environment we live in.
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatized.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
What do these things want and why are they here?
It's in our best interests.
They're free enterprisers.
The Earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
We are like a natural resource to them-- deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
We could be pets.
We could be food.
But all we really are is livestock.
Now, we need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever see their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcast.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button and then all of a sudden-- bang!
They're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
All right, now everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy, that's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work, punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless.
And the movement's suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it trying to figure out how it happened.
Now we start spilling some blood!
[group clamors]
Wait a minute, it's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off!
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
He claims that the signal may be coming from one place.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is coming from somewhere else.
How does she know?
[crowd grumbles]
All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
And the only way we can do--
I got to go talk to someone.
If you're approached by anyone to work for these creatures, by all means accept.
Gain their trust.
Make them believe they can buy you off.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just want to--
Can we just--
Get out!
[continuous gun fire]
[siren wails]
- They're killing everybody.
- I got to find her.
- Wait a minute, man, are you crazy?
- I got to see if she's all right.
Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this thing working, we can listen in.
- Frank,
- What?
- Frank,
- What!
- Get set to shoot.
- Oh, shit!
[loud rumble]
- What was that?
- I don't know.
[woman's voice] Attention, your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway is temporary and will disappear in ten seconds.
- Get in there.
- What?
- Move.
- I don't know what's down there.
- Now!
- Oh, shit.
[woman's voice] Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Five seconds.
Four seconds.
Three seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
[intercom] If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.
What language is that?
I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
There got to be a way out.
I just hope that nobody saw us dropping in.
[radio] Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
All security stations stand down to operational--
Right.
- We have eliminated the terrorists.
- Okay.
We got 'em, we wiped them out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-team.
[distant applause]
I'm hearing something.
[applause closer]
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
You have given us entrée to the resources we need in our ongoing quest for multidimensional expansion.
And in return, the per capita income of each of you here tonight has grown, in this year alone, by an average 39o/o.
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
[crowd applause and cheers]
How you doing boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know you boys really should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I got to tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common first time we met.
[speaker] Money isn't the nicest thing in life,
- Hey, waiter, - [speaker] the only thing.
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me, where the hell are we?
Back stage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How did you get here, use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use 'em except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something?
Take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
[intercom] Attention commuters, flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
Please step in to the transmission platform.
That's where they come from.
All carry-on luggage must be held securely.
Thank you for waiting and we hope you have a pleasant trip.
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal-- bending the light or some damn thing.
But you can move from place to place, world to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together.
Believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait until you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
That's where the signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We bump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
Not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, as far as we go.
A technique called multispectral analysis.
This would allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers and camouflage--
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
Thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
[knocks on glass]
Soundproof.
- Where's that signal?
- It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal, man.
Wait boys, wait you're making a big mistake.
You made the mistake.
No, no, you got to listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you boys?
There ain't no countries anymore.
No more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything-- the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good, for a change.
And they're going to let us have it good if we just help 'em.
They're going to leave us alone.
Let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life too.
Now I know you want it-- hell, everybody does.
You do it to your own kind.
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go!
Is this the two minute break or the thirty second break?
I think it's the thirty second break.
They dropped 12, I guess we must be running long.
I think so.
We are experiencing a technical difficulty.
What the hell's going on?
Come on.
[people clamoring]
Get down!
[whispers] Now what?
Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me.
- Come on, man.
- Wait a second.
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Come on, man, I mean it.
Holly Thompson, assistant program something-or-other.
- Where is she?
- I, I... [intercom] Security alert-- sections delta and x-ray report to the fourth floor immediately.
Who's Holly?
[scream]
Oh, shit.
Well, I hate to interrupt you folks, but could someone please guide me how to get to the roof.
Security.
How do I get to the roof?
There's an elevator through there.
Turn to your left, it's at the end of the hall.
Thank you very much.
Well?
Well, there's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 9-5-0.
Lock the elevators down.
They're on the move.
[screams]
[beeping]
I hear them on the 19th floor above me.
We got you.
We're on the 21st we'll be waiting for 'em.
Go, up.
Holly!
[alarm beeps]
- Come on, come on!
[intercom] Security alert.
Intruders are here-- head for the roof.
Repeat.
Intruders--
Let's go!
[gunshot]
Frank, you and Holly clear?
[woman] I'm clear.
Are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere, you can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we will open fire.
Come inside with me.
You have ten seconds.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Fuck it.
The Oscar winners gave a press conference and "How to Buy a Sailboat" as-- [man] Gloria, you look like shit.
[man] I'm out of here.
[woman] What happened?
What's wrong?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Filmmakers like George Romero and John Carpenter have to show some restraint.
They're simply--
You're filled with lightning when you hit the road.
You're feeling that V6 power as you take control.
Nothing can stop you now.
You're moving on.
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
(Train approaches)
(Train horn blares)
(Tannoy) 'Due to a computer error, 'the food stamp programme has been suspended until further notice.
'Please do not apply at this time.
'All applicants for work wages now report to window D.
'Thank you.'
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
So, er ...
There's nothing available for you right now.
(Preacher) They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners!
Our owners!
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up!
They're all about you, all around you.
(TV) 'Sometimes when I watch TV, I stop being myself, 'and I'm a star of a series or I have my own talk show, 'or I'm on the news getting out of a limo, going someplace important.

'People watch me, and they love me.
'And I'll never, never grow old, 'and I'll never die.'
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
(Indistinct chattering, laughing)
So ...
Er, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site, so you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Chesterfield's over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
(Car horn)
(Car horn)
I don't like nobody following me unless I know why.
Well, I don't turn up with anybody till I see where he's going.
They'll be serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa!
Hey Frank, how's it going?
You may get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What you got in that pack?
Tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, we can use you.
The shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
(Indistinct chattering)
There you go!
Howdy!
- Peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Some more?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule.
"He who has the gold makes the rules."
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience.
Yeah, well, I'm all out.
The whole deal's like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
OK, man, here we are.
Here we are.
Now, you do what you can, but remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how are you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money, I just want a chance.
It'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times these days.

Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
The church lets us use their kitchen.
Till four in the morning?
(Chuckles) Hey, we take care of a lot of people here.
'They are dismantling the sleeping middle-class.
'More and more people are becoming poor.
'We are their cattle.

- Not again!
- 'We cannot break their signal.
'Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
'The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have ...'
- Billy, I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
Could somebody please explain to me what the hell all that's about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
(D Gospel choir singing)
(Gilbert) And there's nothing wrong with it.
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only gonna jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no ... it's not gonna work that way.
We've been all through this!
We have no other choice.
(Clattering)
Robbing banks.
Manufacturing Hoffman lenses till we're blue in the face.
We're just not gonna reach enough people!
We gotta find new people, strong people who'll work with us.
That's my baby.
Oh!
Just leaving, you know ...
Your door was open.
Just wanted to close it.
Didn't want no one breaking in.
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah ...
Now let me touch your face.
- That's fine.
- Mm-hmm, good.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- You're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
It's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I gotta be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see!
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence is what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy who's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- Well, what are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You wanna know the truth?
This kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It does.
It's just people afraid to face the future, that's all it is.
(Frank) Hey!
What's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab setup.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy Gilbert's in there helping them.
I got a job now and I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy.
This way.
All right.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
(Sirens wailing)
Quickly!
Quickly!
(Chattering in Spanish)
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, this way.
This way.
(Sirens wailing)
(Indistinct chattering, shouting)
Frank!
(Man) We know who you are!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
We know you.
(Indistinct shouting)
God help me!
Help me, Jesus!

"Thy rod and thy staff will ..."

Jesus!
Jesus!

Come on!
Come on!
Come on in and join the party, man.
You go with him.
Somebody start World War III?
'Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
'Dash and trash are back.
'Out goes glitter and in comes divine excess.
'The fall collection revels in freedom of expression.

(Tyres screech)
(Shopkeeper) Thank you.
(D Humming)
What's your problem?
I said, what's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
- OK.
How's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
(Shopkeeper) Hey, buddy.
You gonna pay for that or what?
Look buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh!
(Distorted voice) 'Sleep ...
'Sleep ...
'Sleep ...
'Sleep ...

'Sleep ...
Can you believe it?
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, "For yourself and for the baby, go!"
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked!
She served blue corn tortillas!
So dated!
(Laughing)
I'm so depressed.
I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.
(TV) 'The feeling is definitely there.
'It's a new morning in America.
'Fresh.
Vital.
'The old cynicism is gone.
'We have faith in our leaders.
'We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
'It really boils down to our ability to accept.
'We don't need pessimism.
'There are no limits.'
It figures it would be something like this.
Ugh!
Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
(Gasps)
You?
You're OK.
This one?
Real fucking ugly!
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
- Put them on ... formaldehyde face!
- That's enough out of you!
You get out, or I call the cops.
Call the cops?
You know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
(Indistinct chattering)
He's a tall, Caucasian male that doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
(Car horn)
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Huh ...
All right, suppose we settle down.
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
The tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
- We got him.
- Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible!
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet, so we can talk this over.
So, you bastards die just like we do.
(Siren wailing)
(Tyres screech)
(Woman gasps) My goodness!
(Indistinct chattering)
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubble gum.
(Screaming)
(Man) Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male, thirties.
Long hair.
Mama don't like tattletales.
Wearing sunglasses.

(Tyres screech)
(Whirring)
'And who are you, little fella?
'Come to show them where I am.
'Not nice!
'
Drop it!
I said, drop it!
Beat your feet, man.
Take it easy.
I just want a little ride out of here.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
Please, don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
(Man) Hi, Holly!
Hmm!
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet. (Chuckles)
Whoo!
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but you come down hard.
Look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
No!
You have two guns, you're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look, lady, we're in trouble.
They're all around us, and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
We're being controlled by these things.
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we gotta stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, whenever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you!
OK.
You're fighting the forces of evil ... that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look!
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
You have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look ...
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
So, your name's Holly?
Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
So, what do you do?
Assistant programme director.
Cable 54.
- A TV station?
- Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
(Dog barks)
No, no ...
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
(Siren wailing)
(Groans) Ugh ...
(Helicopter approaches)
(Indistinct shouting)
(Man) Frank, I'm ready when you are!
(John) Frank?
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
- How many people did you kill?
- Not people.
You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
- I gotta show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I've got a wife and kids, so leave me alone!
Get out of here!
(Man 1) Oh, come on, Frank ... (Man 2) Hey, move your ass!
(Siren wailing)
(Man 1) I ain't gonna be picking up nothing!
(Man 2) Yeah, you wait until I tell the manager!
(Man 1) Yeah well, then I'm gonna show him.
(Man 2) Watch it!
Oh, no!
No!
(Groaning)
Yo!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey!
You'd better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Hey!
Stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son-of-a ...
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save your own!
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put these on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- OK.
All right.
- OK.
- Come on.
Come on.
- I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
- No!
Oh, fuck!
- (Groans) Shit!
- Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you I didn't want to be involved.
You dirty motherfucker!
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
Fuck it!
(Roars)
Man, I'm sorry.
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put them on!
Fuck you!
(Gasping)
Look!
Look at them.
They're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son-of-a-bitch to wake up out of their dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ... and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
It starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows?
What are they?
Where do they come from?
- Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
- Look man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna wait.
- Wait?
Wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question!
Well, when you get some kind of master plan, you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We gotta find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different, man.
My old Daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean and started tearing at me.
That's why I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once.
Big old razor blade.
He held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please ..."
He just kept moving back and forth ... like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for them.
There's going to be hell to pay.
'Cause I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
(Man) Hey, brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging.
It's like building a park over a toxic waste dump.
Do you see that?
My dad had one like that.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You've gotta memorise them and then destroy the paper.
What's a 'safe house'?
- Hey, Frank!
- Hey.
Hey!
Glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
(Gilbert) Memorise these safe houses.
Memorise these safe houses.
Brand-new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
'There is a signal broadcast every second of every day 'through our television sets, 'even when the set is turned off.'
Hey!
- Any trouble getting here?
- No, we made it fine.
Good.
The city is crawling with cops looking for us.
Most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
The creatures are trading wealth, power.
- People are joining up with them?
- Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger, we start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
(TV) 'Look around at the environment we live in.
'Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons and methane have increased since 1958.
'Earth is being acclimatised.
'They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.'
What do these things want, and why are they here?
It's in their best interests.
They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet — their Third World.
'We are like a natural resource to them.
'Deplete the planet, move on to another.
'They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
'We could be pets.
We could be food.
'But all we really are is livestock.'
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button, and all of a sudden ... bang!
They're gone.
- I'm trying to figure it out.
- All right now, everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy.
That's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So, we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work.
Punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless, and the movement is suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it, trying to figure out how it happened.
- Now we start spilling some blood.
- (All) Yeah!
- No!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
It's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So, what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off.
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
Now, he claims the signal may be coming from one place.
(Holly) KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal's coming from somewhere else.
(Gilbert) All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
I gotta go talk to someone.
(Gilbert continues talking)
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just wanted to ...
Can we just ...?
Get out!
Get out of here!
Round the back!
(Indistinct shouting)
Oh, no!
- Come on, just get out!
- Go, go, go ...
Keep moving, people.
(Gun shots)
(Screams)
They're killing everybody.
- I gotta to find her.
- Wait a minute.
Are you crazy?
- I gotta see if she's all right.
- Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Get set to sweat.
- Oh, shit!
(Zooming)
- What was that?
- I don't know.
(Crackling)
(Tannoy) 'Attention!
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
'This entry way is temporary and will disappear ...'
- Get in there!
Move!
- What?
- We don't know what's down there.
- Now!
'Eight seconds.
'Seven seconds.
'Six seconds.
'Five seconds.
'Four seconds.
'Three seconds.
'Two seconds.
'One second.
'If you need assistance in finding your destination, 'bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.'
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I just hope nobody saw us drop in.
(Tannoy) 'Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
'All security stations stand down to operational status.
- 'We have eliminated the terrorists.'
- OK!
- We got them!
We wiped them out!
- All right!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
(Applause)
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial — both for ourselves and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us entree to the resources we need in our on-going quest for multi-dimensional expansion.
And in return, the per-capita income of each of you here tonight has grown.
And this year alone by an average of 39 %.
Isn't it lovely?
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
(Applause)
How you doing, boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know, you boys really should have dressed for the party now that you can afford it.
I gotta tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common the first time we met.
Hey, waiter!
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me ...
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How'd you get here?
Use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use them except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something, take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
(Tannoy) 'Attention, commuters.
'Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
'Please step to the transmission platform.'
That's where they come from.
'All carry-on luggage must be held securely.'
'Thank you for waiting, and we hope you have a pleasant trip.'
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal, bending the light or some damn thing, but you can move from place to place.
World to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing here works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
Master signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We pump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
I'm not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, that's as far as we go.
(TV presenter) '... multi-spectral analysis.
'This will allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers ...'
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much of a problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
I thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorisation cards?
Right here.
(Groaning)
Watch the door.
(Wailing)
Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal.
Wait boys, wait, you're making a big mistake.
- You made the mistake.
- No, you gotta listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you, boys?
There ain't no countries anymore, no more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything, the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good for a change?
And they're gonna let us have it good if we help just them.
They're gonna leave us alone, let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
Now, I know you want it.
Hell, everybody does.
You'd do it to your own kind?
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Is this the two-minute break or the 30-second break?
I think it's the 30-second break, but I don't know.
- I guess we must be running long.
- I think so.
(TV) 'We are experiencing technical difficulties.'
What the hell is going on?
Come on.
(Indistinct shouting)
Oh, my God!
No!
Get down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
- Excuse me!
- Come on, man!
Wait a sec!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Come on, man, I mean it!
Holly Thompson.
Assistant programme something or other.
Where is she?
(Tannoy) 'Security alert.
'Sections Delta and X-Ray report to the fourth floor immediately.'
Who's Holly?
Oh, shit!
Well, I hate to interrupt you, folks, but could someone please tell me how to get to the roof?
- Security!
- Uh-uh-uh!
How do I get to the roof?
There's an elevator through there.
Turn to your left, it's at the end of the hall.
Thank you very much.
- Well?
- There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
Lock the elevators down.
They're on the move.
(Screaming)
(Groaning)
(Beeping)
I hear them on the 19th floor above me.
Got you.
We're on the 21st.
We'll be waiting for them.
Go!
(Groaning)
Holly!
- Come on!
Come on!
- Hey!
(Tannoy) 'Security alert.
Intruders in here are heading for the roof.
'Repeat.
Intruders ...'
Let's go!

You and Holly clear?
(Holly) I'm clear.
Are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.

Due to a computer error, the food stamp program has been suspended until further notice.
Please do not apply at this time.
All applicants' report wages will now report to window P.
Thank you.
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost fourteen banks in one week.
So, well...
There's nothing available for you right now.
They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful.
And they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners-- our owners!
They have us!
They control us!
They are our masters!
Wake up, they're all about you.
All around you.
Sometimes, when I watch TV,
I stop being myself.
I'm a star of a series or a-- or I have my own talk show or I'm on the news getting out of a limo going some place important.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me and they love me.
And I never, never grow old.
And I never die.
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
Maybe.
I got my own tools.
Well, this is a union job.
So, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site.
So you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Justiceville's over on Fourth Street.
They got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
I don't like nobody following me 'less I know why.
Well, I don't join up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They're serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa.
Hey, throw the ball.
Hey, Frank, how's it going?
Now you get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here's Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
Hi.
Howdy.
What do you got in that pack, tools?
Yes, sir.
Well, if you can use them we can use you.
Shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
There you go.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Want some peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Thanks.
- Some more?
Yes.
Peas?
I got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
Haven't seen them in six months.
Steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule--
He who has the gold makes the rules.
They close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy, fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience with life.
Yeah, well I'm all out.
The whole deal is like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only, everyone's out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
Okay, man, here we are.
Here we are-- now, you do what you can.
But remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money.
I just want the chance, it'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody's got their own hard times these days.
You've always thought you couldn't wear press-on nails because of all the active things you do?
Well, if you're ready for beautiful, natural looking, easy to apply nails, three colors in seven luscious hues, just--
Our impulses are being redirected.
We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
Goddamn hacker, that's the second time tonight that asshole's cut in.
The movement was begun eight months ago by a small group of scientists who discovered quite by accident these signals being sent through--
Thing's giving me a headache.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Must took the hacker's months to figure out how to do this.
The poor and the underclass are growing.
Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
We are focused only on our own gain.
We ha--
Please understand, they are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their primary method of survival.
Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.
...they're pulling the water out of the sand like sponges.
Blow it out your ass.
Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
Oh, the church lets us use their kitchen.
Until four in the morning?
Hey, we're taking care of a lot of people here.
They are dismantling the sleeping middle class.
More and more people are becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
The revo--
Not again.
We cannot break their signal.
Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have--
Danny, I have a headache.
Me too, honey.
Can somebody please explain to me what the hell that's all about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
I just checked the connection and there's nothing wrong with it.
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only going to jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no, that's not going to work that way.
We've been all through this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks, manufacturing Hoffman lenses until we're blue in the face.
We're just not going to reach enough people!
We've got to find new people, strong people-- people to work with us.
That's my baby.
Just leaving-- you know, your door was open.
Just wanted to close it-- didn't want no one breaking in.
Neighborhood watch.
Yeah, well, let me touch your face.
- Mmm, it's good.
- That's fine.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- Eh, you're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here, it's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I got to be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see.
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy, he's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End of the world kind of stuff.
Well, what are they doing?
You know, shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You want to know the truth?
This kind of shit happens the end of every century.
It does-- it's just people afraid to face the future.
It's all it is.
Hey, what's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab set.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy, Gilbert's in there helping them.
Look, I got a job now.
And I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody, nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
It's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy, this way.
All right, now we're going to cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Quickly, quickly!
- Go, go!
- Come on, this way-- this way.
Frank!
We know who you are.
Leave us alone!
We know you!
Don't hurt him either.
God help me!
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
Thy rod and Thy staff will--
Jesus!
Jesus!
Come on!
Come on in and join the party, man.
You go with them.
Somebody start World War III?
Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
Dash and trash are back.
Out goes glitter and in comes divine excess.
The fall collection revels in freedom of expression.
Gay abandon rushes to meet the roaring '90s.
What's your problem?
I said, what's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
- Okay, how's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy, you going to pay for that or what?
Look, buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh.
Sleep, sleep, sleep...
Can you believe it?
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, for yourself and for the baby, go!
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked, she served blue corn tortillas.
It's so dated.
So depressed, I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
It's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America-- fresh, vital.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
We don't need pessimism.
There are no limits.
It figures it would be something like this.
Uh.
Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You, you're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
Oh.
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
Put them back on, formaldehyde face-- That's what we got.
That's enough out of you.
Get out or I call the cops.
Call the cops, you know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon, that--
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall Caucasian male, doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
All right, suppose we settle down?
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
Tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
We got him.
Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible.
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
So you bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubble gum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male, 30s, long hair.
Mama don't like tattletales.
Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you, little fella?
Come to show them where I am.
Not nice.
Drop it!
I said drop it!
Beat your feet.
Take it easy.
Just want a little ride out of here.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
Just keep driving.
Where am I going?
You married?
Yes.
Please don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
Your place.
I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly.
Hmph.
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet.
Whoo.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but, oh, you come down hard.
Now look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
But I needed you to get away.
No, you have two guns.
You're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look lady, we're in trouble.
The whole world's in trouble.
They're all around us and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
I swear to you we're being controlled by these things!
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we got to stop them!
- All right.
I'll do whatever you want whenever you want.
Just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
Okay.
You're fighting the forces of evil that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look.
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.
Yeah, you have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look, uh,
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
So, your name's Holly, right?
Holly Thompson.
It's a pretty name.
So what do you do?
Assistant program director,
Cable 54.
A TV station?
Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
No, no.
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson, 8634 Circleview Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank, we're ready when you are.
Frank.
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
Not people.
You crazy son of a bitch!
- I got to show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I got a wife and kids.
So, leave me alone.
Get out of here.
Watch this.
Oh, no.
Yo.
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey, you better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother,
- Put these on.
- Hey, stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son of a bitch--
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You couldn't even save your own.
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
Not this year.
Okay.
All right.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
- Stop it!
- No!
Fuck!
Shit!
Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you,
I didn't want to be in--
You dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put 'em on.
No!
Shit.
Oh, man, I'm sorry, man.
You f--
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put 'em on!
Fuck you.
Look.
Look at them, they're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
Alley Fifth and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son of a bitch to wake up out of their dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch.
And she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
Starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows.
What are they, where do they come from?
Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
Look, man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we going to do?
We're going to wait.
Wait wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question.
Well, when you get some kind of master plan you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago things were different, man.
My own daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
Turned mean.
Started tearing at me.
So I ran away when I was 13.
Tried to cut me, once.
Big old razor blade.
Held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please."
Just kept moving back and forth.
Like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us.
Those things out there.
Maybe they love it.
Seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for 'em.
Going to be hell to pay.
Because I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
World needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey, brothers.
There's something new going down.
They're using candy floss packages.
It's like building a park for a toxic waste dump.
They colorized it.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You're going to memorize it and then destroy the paper.
What's a safe house?
What kind of gun is that?
Hey, Frank.
- Hey.
- Hey, glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
Memorize these safe houses.
Brand new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
Even when the set is turned off.
- The brain receives the input...
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You have any trouble getting here?
No, we made it fine.
Good, the city's crawling with cops looking for us.
And most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
Creatures are trading wealth, power.
You mean people are joining up with them?
Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger.
We start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Look around the environment we live in.
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatized.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
What do these things want and why are they here?
It's in our best interests.
They're free enterprisers.
The Earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
We are like a natural resource to them-- deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
We could be pets.
We could be food.
But all we really are is livestock.
Now, we need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever see their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcast.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button and then all of a sudden-- bang!
They're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
All right, now everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy, that's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work, punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless.
And the movement's suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it trying to figure out how it happened.
Now we start spilling some blood!
Wait a minute, it's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off!
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
He claims that the signal may be coming from one place.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is coming from somewhere else.
How does she know?
All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
And the only way we can do--
I got to go talk to someone.
If you're approached by anyone to work for these creatures, by all means accept.
Gain their trust.
Make them believe they can buy you off.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just want to--
Can we just--
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I got to find her.
- Wait a minute, man, are you crazy?
- I got to see if she's all right.
Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this thing working, we can listen in.
- Frank,
- What?
- Frank,
- What!
- Get set to shoot.
- Oh, shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Attention, your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway is temporary and will disappear in ten seconds.
- Get in there.
- What?
- Move.
- I don't know what's down there.
- Now!
- Oh, shit.
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Five seconds.
Four seconds.
Three seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.
What language is that?
I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
There got to be a way out.
I just hope that nobody saw us dropping in.
Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
All security stations stand down to operational--
Right.
- We have eliminated the terrorists.
- Okay.
We got 'em, we wiped them out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-team.
I'm hearing something.
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
You have given us entrée to the resources we need in our ongoing quest for multidimensional expansion.
And in return, the per capita income of each of you here tonight has grown, in this year alone, by an average 39o/o.
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
How you doing boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know you boys really should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I got to tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common first time we met.
Money isn't the nicest thing in life,
- Hey, waiter, the only thing.
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me, where the hell are we?
Back stage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How did you get here, use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use 'em except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something?
Take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
Attention commuters, flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
Please step in to the transmission platform.
That's where they come from.
All carry-on luggage must be held securely.
Thank you for waiting and we hope you have a pleasant trip.
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal-- bending the light or some damn thing.
But you can move from place to place, world to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together.
Believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait until you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
That's where the signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We bump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
Not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, as far as we go.
A technique called multispectral analysis.
This would allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers and camouflage--
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
Thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
Soundproof.
- Where's that signal?
- It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal, man.
Wait boys, wait you're making a big mistake.
You made the mistake.
No, no, you got to listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you boys?
There ain't no countries anymore.
No more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything-- the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good, for a change.
And they're going to let us have it good if we just help 'em.
They're going to leave us alone.
Let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life too.
Now I know you want it-- hell, everybody does.
You do it to your own kind.
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go!
Is this the two minute break or the thirty second break?
I think it's the thirty second break.
They dropped 12, I guess we must be running long.
I think so.
We are experiencing a technical difficulty.
What the hell's going on?
Come on.
Get down!
Now what?
Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me.
- Come on, man.
- Wait a second.
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Come on, man, I mean it.
Holly Thompson, assistant program something-or-other.
- Where is she?
- I, I...
Security alert-- sections delta and x-ray report to the fourth floor immediately.
Who's Holly?
Oh, shit.
Well, I hate to interrupt you folks, but could someone please guide me how to get to the roof.
Security.
How do I get to the roof?
There's an elevator through there.
Turn to your left, it's at the end of the hall.
Thank you very much.
Well?
Well, there's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 9-5-0.
Lock the elevators down.
They're on the move.
I hear them on the 19th floor above me.
We got you.
We're on the 21st we'll be waiting for 'em.
Go, up.
Holly!
- Come on, come on!
Security alert.
Intruders are here-- head for the roof.
Repeat.
Intruders--
Let's go!
Frank, you and Holly clear?
I'm clear.
Are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere, you can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we will open fire.
Come inside with me.
You have ten seconds.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Fuck it.
The Oscar winners gave a press conference and "How to Buy a Sailboat" as--
Gloria, you look like shit.
I'm out of here.
What happened?
What's wrong?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Filmmakers like George Romero and John Carpenter have to show some restraint.
They're simply--
You're filled with lightning when you hit the road.
You're feeling that V6 power as you take control.
Nothing can stop you now.
You're moving on.
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
THEY LIVE
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star.
I have my own talk show.
Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me.
And they love me.
I never grow old, and I never die.
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do.
We've got beautiful, natural-Iooking, easy-to-apply nails.
There's seven different colors...
Our impulses are being redirected.
We live in an artificially-induced state of consciousness.
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists.
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent...
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing.
Human rights are non-existent.
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent.
We are focused only on our own gain...
They are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their method of survival.
Keep us asleep.
Keep us selfish.
- Keep us sedated.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.
Did somebody start WW III?

How are you today, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Are you going to pay for that?
THIS IS YOUR GOD
I don't want no hassle.
Pay for it or put it back.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
- There are no limits.
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch...
and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatised.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
... deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
We could be pets or food.
But all we really are is livestock.
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to...
Can we...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination. -
- Bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet -
- Will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters.
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready.
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference...
- Gloria, you look like shit.
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Film makers have to show some restraint...
What's wrong, baby?
'Due to a computer error, 'the food stamp programme has been suspended until further notice.
'Please do not apply at this time.
'All applicants for work wages now report to window D.
'Thank you.'
Last place of employment?
Denver, Colorado.
Worked there for ten years.
Then things just seemed to dry up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
So, er ...
There's nothing available for you right now.
They use their tongues to deceive.
The venom of snakes is under their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have recruited the rich and the powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners!
Our owners!
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up!
They're all about you, all around you.
'Sometimes when I watch TV, I stop being myself, 'and I'm a star of a series or I have my own talk show, 'or I'm on the news getting out of a limo, going someplace important.
'All I ever have to do is be famous.
'People watch me, and they love me.
'And I'll never, never grow old, 'and I'll never die.'
Excuse me.
You need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
So ...
Er, then may I please speak with the shop steward?
Sir?
Hey, there's no sleeping on this site, so you park your ass someplace else tonight.
Excuse me.
Then when do I get paid?
Thursday.
You need a place to stay?
Chesterfield's over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I'm going that way if you want me to show you.
I don't like nobody following me unless I know why.
Well, I don't turn up with anybody till I see where he's going.
They'll be serving the food up soon.
Good, I'm starving.
Whoa!
Hey Frank, how's it going?
You may get a chance to meet some of the folk.
This here is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What you got in that pack?
Tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, we can use you.
The shower's caving in over there.
Let's get something to eat.
There you go!
Howdy!
- Peas?
- Yeah, please.
- Some more?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off left and right.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break when they needed it.
Know what they gave themselves?
Raises.
The golden rule.
"He who has the gold makes the rules."
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to one of their fancy fucking foreign cars.
You know, you ought to have a little more patience.
Yeah, well, I'm all out.
The whole deal's like some kind of crazy game.
They put you at the starting line, the name of the game is, "Make it through life."
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in at the same time.
OK, man, here we are.
Here we are.
Now, you do what you can, but remember, I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
So, how are you going to make it?
I deliver a hard day's work for my money, I just want a chance.
It'll come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times these days.
'And you've always thought you couldn't wear press-on nails 'because of all the active things you do?
'Well, if you're ready for beautiful, natural-looking, easy-to-apply nails, recoloured in seven luscious hues, 'just ...'
'Our impulses are being redirected.
'We are living in an artificially-induced state of consciousness 'that resembles sleep.'
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
'The movement was begun eight months ago 'by a small group of scientists who discovered — quite by accident — 'these signals being sent through ...'
- That thing's giving me a headache.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
Must have took the hacker months to figure out how to do this.
'The poor and the under-class are growing.
'Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
'They have created a repressive society, 'and we are their unwitting accomplices.
'Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
'We have been lulled into a trance.
'They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
'We are focused only on our own gain.
'We ...
'Please understand, 'they are safe as long as they are not discovered.
'That is their primary method of survival.
'Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.'
Blow it out of your ass!
Choir practice went a little late last night, didn't it?
The church lets us use their kitchen.
Till four in the morning?
Hey, we take care of a lot of people here.
'They are dismantling the sleeping middle-class.
'More and more people are becoming poor.
'We are their cattle.
'We are being bred for slavery.'
- Not again!
- 'We cannot break their signal.
'Our transmitter is not powerful enough.
'The signal must be shut off at the source.
We have ...'
- Billy, I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
Could somebody please explain to me what the hell all that's about?
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.
And there's nothing wrong with it.
We have to face facts.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
It's time to forget about breaking in on top of their signal.
They're only gonna jam us out again and again.
Then we have to send the shipment out on the street.
No, no, no ... it's not gonna work that way.
We've been all through this!
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Manufacturing Hoffman lenses till we're blue in the face.
We're just not gonna reach enough people!
We gotta find new people, strong people who'll work with us.
That's my baby.
Oh!
Just leaving, you know ...
Your door was open.
Just wanted to close it.
Didn't want no one breaking in.
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah ...
Now let me touch your face.
- That's fine.
- Mm-hmm, good.
Now your hands.
- That's fine.
- Good.
- You're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
It's the revolution.
Let me show you.
I gotta be going right now.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Huh?
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord has let me see!
You'll be back.
You'll be back!
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.
Weird stuff.
Some sort of epidemic of violence is what they've been saying.
I was talking to one old boy who's from San Anselmo.
He told me they got some sort of cult up there.
End-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- Well, what are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
Same old thing as always.
Whole lot of people gone crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
You wanna know the truth?
This kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It does.
It's just people afraid to face the future, that's all it is.
Hey!
What's happening?
I was inside there a while.
All kinds of cardboard boxes, some kind of lab setup.
What do you mean?
There's no singing.
It's a tape recorder.
Leave it alone, man.
It ain't none of my business, ain't none of yours.
Yeah, but our boy Gilbert's in there helping them.
I got a job now and I plan on keeping it.
I'm walking a white line all the time.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You better start doing the same.
White line's in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
Step down.
Watch it.
Easy, easy.
This way.
All right.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Quickly!
Quickly!
- Go, go, go!

- OK.
How's it going?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy.
You gonna pay for that or what?
Look buddy, I don't want no hassle today.
Either pay for it or put it back.
Huh!

She didn't even go to Lamaze class.
I told her, "For yourself and for the baby, go!"
Did Bob make you go to John and Mary Ellen's last night?
I was shocked!
She served blue corn tortillas!
So dated!
I'm so depressed.
I don't know what to do.
Hey, go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.

Excuse me.
You know, you look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You?
You're OK.
This one?
Real fucking ugly!
You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person, doesn't she, huh?
- Put them on ... formaldehyde face!
- That's enough out of you!
You get out, or I call the cops.
Call the cops?
You know what you need?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male that doesn't appear armed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Huh ...
All right, suppose we settle down.
That's far enough.
Where'd you get those glasses?
The tooth fairy.
I'll bet.
- We got him.
- Nick yourself shaving this morning?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
Impossible!
It would be easier if we don't have to splatter your brains.
Just take it easy.
Now, you stumbled onto something here.
Maybe we can all benefit from this slight misunderstanding.
Now, let's go someplace quiet, so we can talk this over.
So, you bastards die just like we do.
My goodness!
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.

Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
Please, don't lie to me.
No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not do that.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
Hmm!
Look, I don't know what you want.
Oh, just quiet.
Whoo!
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high, but you come down hard.
Look, things turned out a little sour for me today.
You're not the only one.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
No!
You have two guns, you're not sorry.
You're in charge.
Look, lady, we're in trouble.
They're all around us, and we never knew it.
You can only see them with these special glasses.
We're being controlled by these things.
I don't know what they are or where they came from, but we gotta stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, whenever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you!
OK.
You're fighting the forces of evil ... that none of us can see without sunglasses.
Take a look!
If you want me to look through your sunglasses,
I'll look through your sunglasses.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
You have it your way, huh?
It's not my way.
It's your way.
Don't fuck with me.
I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
Look ...
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?
So, your name's Holly?
Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
So, what do you do?
Assistant programme director.
Cable 54.
- A TV station?
- Yes.
They're sending some kind of signals out of TV sets.
No, no ...
I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Ugh ...
Frank, I'm ready when you are!
Frank?
Don't let nobody see you.
I've had a rough couple of days.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
- How many people did you kill?
- Not people.
You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
- I gotta show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!
I've got a wife and kids, so leave me alone!
Get out of here!
Oh, come on, Frank ...
Hey, move your ass!
I ain't gonna be picking up nothing!
Yeah, you wait until I tell the manager!
Yeah well, then I'm gonna show him.
Watch it!
Oh, no!
No!
Yo!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
Hey!
You'd better find yourself someplace to hide and keep praying nobody ever finds you.
Try these on.
Look, you crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Hey!
Stay away from me!
I'm telling you, you dumb son-of-a ...
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save your own!
I'm giving you a choice.
Either put these on these glasses or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- OK.
All right.
- OK.
- Come on.
Come on.
- I don't want to fight you.
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
- No!
Oh, fuck!
- Shit!
- Put on the glasses.
Man, I told you I didn't want to be involved.
You dirty motherfucker!
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
Fuck it!
Man, I'm sorry.
Fuck!
Put the glasses on!
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
Look at them.
They're everywhere.
Maybe they can see.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Now hold on.
You ain't the first son-of-a-bitch to wake up out of their dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ... and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
Don't wear them glasses too long.
It starts to feel like a knife turning in your skull.
How long have they been there?
Who knows?
What are they?
Where do they come from?
- Well, they ain't from Cleveland.
- Look man, I don't need that kind of shit!
What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna wait.
- Wait?
Wait for what?
You know, that really answers my fucking question!
Well, when you get some kind of master plan, you let me know, huh?
We can't be the only ones who can see.
We gotta find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different, man.
My old Daddy took me down to the river, kicked my ass, told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean and started tearing at me.
That's why I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once.
Big old razor blade.
He held it up against my throat.
I said, "Daddy, please ..."
He just kept moving back and forth ... like he was sawing down a little tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold fucking hearts.
I got news for them.
There's going to be hell to pay.
'Cause I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight.
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey, brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging.
It's like building a park over a toxic waste dump.
Do you see that?
My dad had one like that.
Here's a list of safe houses.
You've gotta memorise them and then destroy the paper.
What's a 'safe house'?
- Hey, Frank!
- Hey.
Hey!
Glad you made it.
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.
We're all human in here.
Memorise these safe houses.
Memorise these safe houses.
Brand-new.
Got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
'There is a signal broadcast every second of every day 'through our television sets, 'even when the set is turned off.'
Hey!
- Any trouble getting here?
- No, we made it fine.
Good.
The city is crawling with cops looking for us.
Most of the cops are human.
They've been told that we're commies trying to bring down the government.
And some of them are being recruited.
The creatures are trading wealth, power.
- People are joining up with them?
- Most of us just sell out right away.
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.
Our bank accounts get bigger, we start buying new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
'Look around at the environment we live in.
'Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons and methane have increased since 1958.
'Earth is being acclimatised.
'They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.'
What do these things want, and why are they here?
It's in their best interests.
They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet — their Third World.
'We are like a natural resource to them.
'Deplete the planet, move on to another.
'They want benign indifference.
They want us drugged.
'We could be pets.
We could be food.
'But all we really are is livestock.'
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard when the time comes.
You've got it.
Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
What's that?
They all wear these expensive watches.
Turns out they're really two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
There's something else.
Some kind of secret code or hidden control.
They push a button, and all of a sudden ... bang!
They're gone.
- I'm trying to figure it out.
- All right now, everybody listen up.
Now, we're obviously not getting to enough people because look at our numbers tonight.
There should be twice as many of us here.
We're getting too sloppy.
That's all there is to it.
Now, their detection is becoming more effective.
So, we have to be more careful.
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.
Go to work.
Punch your time clocks.
Do what's expected of you.
We've gotten reckless, and the movement is suffering for it.
Time to stop talking about it, trying to figure out how it happened.
- Now we start spilling some blood.
- Yeah!
- No!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
It's not working!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
So, what are we supposed to do?
We bide our time.
We seek out and locate their signal and shut it off.
Wake people up!
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.
Now, he claims the signal may be coming from one place.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal's coming from somewhere else.
All right, this is the point.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal's coming from.
I gotta go talk to someone.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
I thought I'd killed you.
I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I just wanted to ...
Can we just ...?
Get out!
Get out of here!
Round the back!
Oh, no!
- Come on, just get out!
- Go, go, go ...
Keep moving, people.
They're killing everybody.
- I gotta to find her.
- Wait a minute.
Are you crazy?
- I gotta see if she's all right.
- Just stay back!
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Frank ...
- What?
- Get set to sweat.
- Oh, shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
'Attention!
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
'This entry way is temporary and will disappear ...'
- Get in there!
Move!
- What?
- We don't know what's down there.
- Now!
'Eight seconds.
'Seven seconds.
'Six seconds.
'Five seconds.
'Four seconds.
'Three seconds.
'Two seconds.
'One second.
'If you need assistance in finding your destination, 'bilingual instructions are posted at the end of each corridor.'
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
Where the hell are we?
I think we're under the city.
Maybe some kind of underground base or something.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I just hope nobody saw us drop in.
'Operation Steel Fist has been a complete success.
'All security stations stand down to operational status.
- 'We have eliminated the terrorists.'
- OK!
- We got them!
We wiped them out!
- All right!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial — both for ourselves and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us entree to the resources we need in our on-going quest for multi-dimensional expansion.
And in return, the per-capita income of each of you here tonight has grown.
And this year alone by an average of 39 %.
Isn't it lovely?
And I've just received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed here on the West Coast.
We are off crisis alert.
The situation is normal again.
How you doing, boys?
I didn't know you'd been recruited.
Welcome aboard.
You know, you boys really should have dressed for the party now that you can afford it.
I gotta tell you, I sure am proud to be here.
You seen the whole place?
I haven't had a chance to yet.
Come on, I'll show you around.
You know, I knew me and you had a lot in common the first time we met.
Hey, waiter!
Thank you, buddy.
Excuse me ...
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage at the show, boys.
I'll admit it is a little funky, but it serves its purpose.
How'd you get here?
Use one of these little portable jobs?
I know we ain't supposed to use them except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.
Now, you think that's something, take a look at this.
Go on, take a closer look.
'Attention, commuters.
'Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.
'Please step to the transmission platform.'
That's where they come from.
'All carry-on luggage must be held securely.'
'Thank you for waiting, and we hope you have a pleasant trip.'
I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal, bending the light or some damn thing, but you can move from place to place.
World to world if you want to.
You see, the whole thing here works like one big airport.
Boys, let me tell you, they got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.
Master signal goes out from here to the satellite.
We pump it out all over the world.
Pretty fancy, huh?
I'm not too familiar with it myself.
Well, boys, that's as far as we go.
'...
Multi-spectral analysis.
'This will allow space sensors to penetrate natural barriers ...'
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio before.
You look like the gentleman to ask.
Well, I guess it wouldn't be that much of a problem.
You see them boys over there?
Friends of mine.
Hey, fellas, I got a couple of my buddies here.
I thought I'd give them the grand tour.
Think we can go inside?
Be serious.
You have your authorisation cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
It's up on the roof, I think.
Holly works in there.
If she made it, maybe we can find her.
Then we can go to the roof and break that signal.
Wait boys, wait, you're making a big mistake.
- You made the mistake.
- No, you gotta listen to me.
I thought you boys understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it, do you, boys?
There ain't no countries anymore, no more good guys.
They're running the whole show.
They own everything, the whole goddamn planet.
They can do whatever they want.
What's wrong with having it good for a change?
And they're gonna let us have it good if we help just them.
They're gonna leave us alone, let us make some money.
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
Now, I know you want it.
Hell, everybody does.
You'd do it to your own kind?
What's the threat?
We all sell out every day.
Might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Is this the two-minute break or the 30-second break?
I think it's the 30-second break, but I don't know.
- I guess we must be running long.
- I think so.
'We are experiencing technical difficulties.'
What the hell is going on?
Come on.
Oh, my God!
No!
Get down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
- Excuse me!
- Come on, man!
Wait a sec!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Come on, man, I mean it!
Holly Thompson.
Assistant programme something or other.
Where is she?
'Security alert.
'Sections Delta and X-Ray report to the fourth floor immediately.'
Who's Holly?
Oh, shit!
Well, I hate to interrupt you, folks, but could someone please tell me how to get to the roof?
- Security!
- Uh-uh-uh!
How do I get to the roof?
There's an elevator through there.
Turn to your left, it's at the end of the hall.
Thank you very much.
- Well?
- There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
Lock the elevators down.
They're on the move.
I hear them on the 19th floor above me.
Got you.
We're on the 21st.
We'll be waiting for them.
Go!
Holly!
- Come on!
Come on!
- Hey!
'Security alert.
Intruders in here are heading for the roof.
'Repeat.
Intruders ...'
Let's go!
Frank!
You and Holly clear?
I'm clear.
Are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
'Drop your weapon.
'Stand away from the dish or we will open fire.'
Come inside with me.
'You have ten seconds.
'Nine.
'Eight.
'Seven.
'Six.'
Fuck it!
'The Oscar winners give a press conference, 'and how to buy a sail boat ...'
Gloria, you look like shit.
I'm out of here!
- What happened?
- What's wrong?
'All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me
'I'm fed up with it.
'Film makers like George Romero and John Carpenter 'have to show some restraint.
They're simply ...'
'You're filled with lightning.
'When you hit the road, you're feeling that V6 power as you take control.
'Nothing can stop you now.
'You're moving on.'
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
THEY LIVE
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years ...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star
I have my own talk show Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo
All I ever have to do is be famous People watch me
And they love me
I never grow old, and I never die
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do
We've got beautiful, natural-Iooking, easy-to-apply nails
There's seven different colors
Our impulses are being redirected
We live in an artifiicially-induced state of consciousness
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing Human rights are non-existent
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness
We have been lulled into a trance They have made us indifferent
We are focused only on our own gain
They are safe as long as they are not discovered
That is their method of survival Keep us asleep Keep us selfiish
- Keep us sedated
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor
We are their cattle We are being bred for slavery
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal
The signal must be shut off at the source
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution ...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is defiinitely there It's a new morning in America
The old cynicism is gone We have faith in our leaders
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all
It really boils down to our ability to accept
- There are no limits
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil ...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way ...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ...
and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958 Earth is being acclimatised
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
deplete the planet, move on to another
They want benign indifference We could be pets or food
But all we really are is livestock
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button ...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to ...
Can we ...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear ...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program ... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine ...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference
- Gloria, you look like shit
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me
I'm fed up with it Film makers have to show some restraint
What's wrong, baby?

- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star.
I have my own talk show.
Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me.
And they love me.
I never grow old, and I never die.
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do.
We've got beautiful, natural-looking, easy-to-apply nails.
There's seven different colors...
Our impulses are being redirected.
We live in an artificially-induced state of consciousness.
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists.
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent...
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing.
Human rights are non-existent.
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent.
We are focused only on our own gain...
They are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their method of survival.
Keep us asleep.
Keep us selfish.
- Keep us sedated.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. "
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
- There are no limits.
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!

If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference...
- Gloria, you look like shit.
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Film makers have to show some restraint...
What's wrong, baby?
THEY LIVE
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star.
I have my own talk show.
Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me.
And they love me.
I never grow old, and I never die.
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do.
We've got beautiful, natural-looking, easy-to-apply nails.
There's seven different colors...
Our impulses are being redirected.
We live in an artificially-induced state of consciousness.
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists.
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent...
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing.
Human rights are non-existent.
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent.
We are focused only on our own gain...
They are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their method of survival.
Keep us asleep.
Keep us selfish.
- Keep us sedated.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. "
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.
Did somebody start WW III?
Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.

I don't want no hassle.
Pay for it or put it back.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is definitely there.
It's a new morning in America.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
- There are no limits.
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch...
and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please. "
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatised.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
... deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
We could be pets or food.
But all we really are is livestock.
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to...
Can we... ?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters.
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready.
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?

What's your problem?
What's your problem?
How are you today, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Are you going to pay for that?
THIS IS YOUR GOD
I don't want no hassle.
Pay for it or put it back.

Sleep.
Sleep.
She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is definitely there- It's a new morning in America.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
- There are no limits-
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Fran k?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
Oh, no!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Fran k?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatised.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
...deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
We could be pets or food.
But all we really are is livestock.
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to
Can we ...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters.
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready.
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you , boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference ...
- Gloria, you look like shit.
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me.
I'm fed up with it.
Film makers have to show some restraint ...
What's wrong, baby?
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years ...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star
I have my own talk show Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo
All I ever have to do is be famous People watch me
And they love me
I never grow old, and I never die
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do
We've got beautiful, natural-Iooking, easy-to-apply nails
There's seven different colors
Our impulses are being redirected
We live in an artifiicially-induced state of consciousness
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing Human rights are non-existent
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness
We have been lulled into a trance They have made us indifferent
We are focused only on our own gain
They are safe as long as they are not discovered
That is their method of survival Keep us asleep Keep us selfiish
- Keep us sedated
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor
We are their cattle We are being bred for slavery
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal
The signal must be shut off at the source
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution ...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958 Earth is being acclimatised
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
deplete the planet, move on to another
They want benign indifference We could be pets or food
But all we really are is livestock
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button ...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to ...
Can we ...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear ...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program ... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine ...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference
- Gloria, you look like shit
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me
I'm fed up with it Film makers have to show some restraint
What's wrong, baby?
THEY LIVE
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star.
I have my own talk show.
Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo.
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me.
And they love me.
I never grow old, and I never die.
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do.
We've got beautiful, natural-looking, easy-to-apply nails.
There's seven different colors ...
Our impulses are being redirected.
We live in an artificially-induced state of consciousness.
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists.
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent ...
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing.
Human rights are non-existent.
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices.
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent.
We are focused only on our own gain ...
They are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their method of survival.
Keep us asleep.
Keep us selfish.
- Keep us sedated.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor.
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal.
The signal must be shut off at the source.
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They just jam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got a job now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Fran k!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.
Did somebody start WW Ill?
Oman's collection puts passion before fashion.
Out goes glitter and in comes divine excess.
The warm collection revels in freedom of expression.

What's your problem?

How are you today, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Are you going to pay for that?
THIS IS YOUR GOD
I don't want no hassle.
Pay for it or put it back.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
She didn't even go to Lamas class.
I told her, for yourself and the baby, go.
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas!
So dated!
- I'm so depressed.
What do I do?
- Go for it, man.
That's easy for you to say, you got the promotion.
The feeling is definitely there- It's a new morning in America.
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.
We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
It really boils down to our ability to accept.
- There are no limits-
- I figured on something like this.
Excuse me.
You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of bubblegum.
Near the entrance.
Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s.
Long hair.
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.
And who are you?
Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Beat it.
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Fran k?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
Oh, no!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Fran k?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958.
Earth is being acclimatised.
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
...deplete the planet, move on to another.
They want benign indifference.
We could be pets or food.
But all we really are is livestock.
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?

They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star
I have my own talk show Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo
All I ever have to do is be famous People watch me
And they love me
I never grow old, and I never die
Excuse me, do you need anybody?
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.
This is a union job.
May I please speak with the shop steward, sir?
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.
Excuse me, when do I get paid?
Thursday.
Do you need a place to stay?
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.
I don't like being followed unless I know why.
I don't turn up with anybody until I see where he's going.
They'll be serving food up soon.
This is Gilbert.
Anything you need, he knows where to find it.
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.
If you can use them, you can fix the shower over there.
Let's get something to eat.
- More?
- Yeah.
I've got a wife and two kids back in Detroit.
I haven't seen them in six months.
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.
The golden rule:
He who has the gold makes the rules.
If they close one more factory, we should take a sledge to their foreign cars.
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.
The whole deal is some kind of crazy game.
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.
Only everyone is out for themselves and looking to do you in.
You do what you can, but I'm going to do my best to blow your ass away.
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.
Everybody has got their own hard times, these days.
You thought press-on nails would impede all the active things you do
We've got beautiful, natural-Iooking, easy-to-apply nails
There's seven different colors
Our impulses are being redirected
We live in an artifiicially-induced state of consciousness
Goddamn hacker.
That's the second time tonight that asshole has cut in.
The movement began eight months ago by a group of scientists
They accidentally discovered these signals being sent
That thing's giving me a headache.
It must have taken him months to figure out how to do this.
The under-class is growing Human rights are non-existent
In their repressive society, we are their unwitting accomplices
Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness
We have been lulled into a trance They have made us indifferent
We are focused only on our own gain
They are safe as long as they are not discovered
That is their method of survival Keep us asleep Keep us selfiish
- Keep us sedated
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.
The sleeping middle-class is suddenly becoming poor
We are their cattle We are being bred for slavery
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal
The signal must be shut off at the source
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP
There's nothing wrong with it.
Only a few seconds got on the air.
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work.
We've discussed this.
We have no other choice.
Robbing banks.
Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.
We've got to find strong people who'll work with us.
I'm just leaving.
Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.
Now your hands.
You're a working man.
The revolution ...
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.
This world may have blinded me, but the Lord let me see.
You'll be back.
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.
An epidemic of violence is what they're saying.
I was talking to one old boy from San Anselmo.
He says up there they're talking end-of-the-world kind of stuff.
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.
A whole lot of people going crazy over some nutty dream they just had.
The truth is, this kind of shit happens at the end of every century.
It's just people afraid to face the future.
What's happening?
I was inside there.
It's full of boxes and some kind of lab setup.
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.
Gilbert is in there helping them.
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.
I don't bother nobody.
Nobody bothers me.
You should do the same.
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
Step down.
Easy.
This way.
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.
Go, go!
Frank!
Leave us alone.
We know you.
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

You look like your head fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.
I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.
I've got one that can see.
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.
I don't like this one bit.
Not one bit.
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?
You look as shitty to us as we do to you.
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.
You stumbled onto something here, but maybe we can all benefit from it.
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk this over.
You bastards die just like we do.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.

Come to show them where I am.
Drop it.

We're just going on a little ride.
Close the door.
Drive.
Not too fast.
They're gone.
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?
- Are you married?
- Yes.
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil ...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way ...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch ...
and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers ...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958 Earth is being acclimatised
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
deplete the planet, move on to another
They want benign indifference We could be pets or food
But all we really are is livestock
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button ...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to ...
Can we ...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear ...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program ... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine ...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference
- Gloria, you look like shit
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me
I'm fed up with it Film makers have to show some restraint
What's wrong, baby?
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.
I worked there for ten years...
but then things just dried up.
They lost 14 banks in one week.
There's nothing available for you, right now.
They use their tongues to deceive you.
Venom is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
They have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Outside the limit of our sight they're feeding off us.
Perched on top of us from birth to death, are our owners.
They have us.
They control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all around you.
Sometimes when I watch TV I stop being myself.
I'm a star
I have my own talk show Or I'm on the news getting out of a limo

- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.
Live alone?
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.
I'm afraid I must insist.
Hi, Holly!
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.
It's like a drug.
Wearing these glasses makes you high but you come down hard.
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to get away.
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.
We're in trouble.
They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.
We're being controlled by these things and we've got to stop them.
I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt me, please.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.
You're fighting the forces of evil...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.
If I don't see what you see, I'm going to see it anyway.
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way...
It's your way.
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry I have to be here.
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?
Assistant program director.
Cable 54.
A TV station?
They're sending signals out of TV sets.
No, I'm all right.
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.
Yes, I'll hold.
Frank?
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.
You ain't showing me nothing.
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
No!
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.
Wait!
You'd better find someplace to hide.
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.
I'm trying to save you and your family's life.
You can't even save yourself.
I'm giving you a choice.
Put these on or start eating that trash can.
- Not this year.
- Okay.
Come on.
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.
Put on the glasses.
I told you I didn't want to be involved.
Dirty motherfucker.
Take a look.
Put them on.
No!
I'm sorry.
Put the glasses on.
Put them on!
Fuck you!
Look!
They're everywhere.
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.
Hold on.
You aren't the first one to wake up out of a dream.
What's that?
Brother, life's a bitch...
and she's back in heat.
I want a room.
Ain't love grand?
CONFORM
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?
- Wait.
- Wait for what?
When you get your master plan, you let me know.
If we can see, we've got to find the people who made these.
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.
A long time ago, things were different.
Daddy took me down to the river and told me about the power and the glory.
I was saved.
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.
I ran away when I was 13.
He tried to cut me once with a big old razor.
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."
He kept moving back and forth, like he was sawing down a tree.
Maybe they've always been with us, those things out there.
Maybe they love it, seeing us hate each other.
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.
I've got news for him.
There's going to be hell to pay.
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.
Frank?
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.
The world needs a wake-up call.
We're going to phone it in.
Hey brothers...
There's something new going down.
They're using candyfloss packaging to cover up a toxic waste dump.
Frank, glad you made it.
Take your glasses off.
We're all human in here.
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.
Go ahead.
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.
Promotions, bank accounts, new houses, cars.
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.
Fluorocarbons have increased since 1958 Earth is being acclimatised
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.
The earth is just another developing planet.
Their third world.
deplete the planet, move on to another
They want benign indifference We could be pets or food
But all we really are is livestock
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?
Once.
- What's that?
- One of their watches.
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.
They've got secret code.
They push a button...
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.
Listen up.
We're obviously not getting to enough people.
There should be twice as many people here.
We're getting too sloppy.
Their detection is becoming more effective.
Stay aware.
Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.
Stop talking about it.
It's time we started spilling some blood.
Wait a minute!
We don't stand a chance with a few guns and grenades.
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.
We locate their signal and shut it off.
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.
KRDA is clear.
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.
It's important to find out exactly where this signal is coming from.
I've got to talk to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.
I just want to...
Can we...?
Get out!
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.
There's nothing you can do out there.
If I can get this working, I can listen in.
- Frank...
- What?
- Get set.
- Shit!
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear...
Move!
Down there!
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.
Two seconds.
One second.
If you need assistance in finding your destination, bilingual instructions are posted in each corridor.
- What language is that?
- I don't know.
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.
Some kind of underground base.
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.
I'm hearing something.
By the year 2025, America and the entire planet will be under the protection of this power alliance.
The gains have been substantial for us and for you, the human power-elite.
You have given us the resources we need for our expansion.
In return, the per-capita income of each of you has grown.
This year alone, it's an average 39%.
I've received word that our forces have won a major victory.
The underground terrorist network has been destroyed.
The situation is normal again.
Hi boys, I didn't know you'd been recruited.
You should have dressed for the party now you can afford it.
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.
I knew we had a lot in common the first time we met.
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?
I know it's only for emergency, but they're so much fun.
You think that's something, take a look at this.
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready
That's where they come from.
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.
It puts a bend in the light and you move from place to place.
The whole thing works like one big airport.
They've got their act together, believe you me.
Evening, boys.
Looking sharp.
Wait till you see what I'm going to show you now.
Here's the brains of the operation.
The signal goes out through the satellite all over the world.
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.
This is as far as we go.
Can you get us inside?
I've never seen the inside of a TV studio.
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.
Those boys over there are friends of mine.
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?
Right here.
Watch the door.
- Soundproof.
Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.
If we help them, they'll leave us alone to make some money.
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?
We all sell out every day, might as well be on the winning team.
See you, boys.
Let's go.
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.
What the hell is going on?
Down!
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program... something.
Security alert.
Sections Delta and X-ray report to the fourth floor.
Who's Holly?
Shit!
I hate to interrupt.
Could you tell me how to get to the roof?
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.
There's got to be more than one way to get up there.
Security 950.
They're on the move.
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st.
We've got them.
Holly!
Come on!
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.
Frank!
Are you and Holly clear?
I'm clear, are you?
Don't do it.
Don't interfere.
You can't win.
Drop your weapon.
Stand away from the dish or we'll open fire.
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds.
Nine...
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
The Oscar winners give a press conference
- Gloria, you look like shit
- What happened?
All the sex and violence on the screen has gone too far for me
I'm fed up with it Film makers have to show some restraint
What's wrong, baby?

[Explosion]
MS. CAMDEN:
Who's down there?
Just me, Ms. Camden.
MS. CAMDEN:
Mr. Thorn, what business
Have you in the cellar?
Setting traps, ma'am.
MS. CAMDEN:
I realize that you are new around here.
However, your responsibilities lie outside of the house.
I suggest that you return to yours at once.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, that's a good one. "Victim 66."
What better place to read a script than on a movie set?
Mr. Joverson, I have just come from the cellar where I
Found Mr. Thorn snooping about.
Well?
Well what?
UNCLE IVE:
Ms. Camden, you know perfectly well
What, or else you wouldn't be telling me this.
There is no indication that it was discovered.
If that's true, why all the fuss?
Because although I don't think he found it,
I also don't feel that enough caution can be exercised
Regarding this subject.
I understand your concern.
However, I...
I feel you are needlessly worrying yourself.
[Glass breaking]
"He emerges from the cave as if created from the bowels"
Of the universe to seek out and avenge death upon
"A mortal creature of earth."
Boy, some silly shit.
"Then, as though it was possessed"

Thought and one thought only.
Fire Thorn.
Fire Thorn.
"Thorn, you're fired."
Oh, that bitch.
That's her idea of some kind of a joke.
And for what?
Doing my job?
(SOFT ACCENT) Mr. Thorn.
Your responsibilities lie outside the house.
Mine lie within.
Yeah, well, you'll see.
Got a case, huh.
That figures.
Taking everything from me from the day I started here.
I knew it.
Mr. Thorn.
I've been meaning to tell you that your employ here
Will be determined by your ability
To follow through with rules.
Rules, my ass.
Bitch runs this place like a prison, like she owns it.
Mr. Thorn, your past will have no reflection on my feelings
Towards you.
Give me a break.
[Dogs barking]
What the hell is the idea behind all of this?
Is this your idea of some kind of a joke?
Or don't you have the guts to confront
Me and tell me yourself?
You're gutless, Camden.
Gutless.
Oh, I love your get-up.
I think you watch too many cartoons.
Come on, Camden.
Fire me.
Fire me.
[Flamethrower sounds]
[Screams]
[MUSIC AZHA, "NIGHT OF OUR LIVES"]
Your uncle's been waiting to see you.
Go ahead.
We'll unpack.
Come on.
This place is amazing.
Yes, it is.
Your uncle has spent many years traveling while constantly
Adding to his collection.
Electric piece of shit.
It must be jammed again.
Cary must have his own secret code.
Hey, yo, Linda.
What do you say you and I go for a little walk
While Lenny here plays Mr. Goodwrench?
How do I know I can trust you?
You don't.
Well, if that's the case, let's go.
Yo, Shelly.
What do you say we go for a little walk
And see if we can find something to persuade
This thing to open, OK?
Can I trust you?
Yeah, I guess so.
Cary.
I'm so glad to see you've arrived safely.
CARY:
Dad said that you collected things,
But I never imagined it would be like this.
UNCLE IVE:
It's taken me quite some time
To put all this together.
I can believe it.
Over here.
Oh, we'll definitely find something.
"Victim 67."
Ah.
I think I found my persuader.
Great.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
This place is so beautiful.
Yeah, great.
Nature.
Hey, uh, what do you say you and I get au natural?
Not here.
Anyone could just walk by and see us.
Who?
Who's going to walk by.
We're 20 miles in the middle of nowhere.
All right, Ms. Modesty.
How 'bout those bushes at the end of the path?
You know, Cary, it might be more interesting for you
And your friends to stay over in the Mexican village
While you're here.
That way, you could have the whole place to yourselves.
MS. CAMDEN:
Yes, Cary.
It might be a good idea for you and your friends
To stay in a separate house during your visit
So as not to disturb your uncle.
I had entertained the idea and I've
Prepared it for your visit.
That's one of the old movie sets, isn't it?
[Giggling]
[Scream]
I think I'm gonna puke.
Suspect and...
DETECTIVE BENJAMIN:
You say the last time
You spoke to the victim was yesterday afternoon?
Yes, you heard me correctly.
Seems as though the deceased was
Struck down by what appears to be
Some sort of incendiary device.
Now, it's evident that further investigation
Will be necessary, but off the record, this was no accident.
Excuse me.
Mr. Joverson, I really do not feel
That it is necessary for you to be out here.
Excuse me, Ms. Camden, but I would
Like to ask Mr. Joverson some questions, if you don't mind.
Hi, I'm Detective Benjamin.
Good evening.
Ive Joverson.
Tell me.
How long was Garland Thorn in your employ?
Approximately two months.
Oh man.
Did you see that shit?
I mean, he was fucked up.
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
I never seen anything like that before.
No, I mean his legs were all up around his neck
And his chest was all caved in and he was all toasted.
He had bugs everywhere.
In his eyes, in his mouth.
[Crying]
SHELLY:
Gene, would you stop it?
You're only making things worse.
Look, I'm one for getting fried, but this is ridiculous.
Dude, just cool it, all right?
Uncle Ive.
Uncle Ive, I'm sorry about Mr. Thorn.
UNCLE IVE:
I, too, am sorry.
Thorn?
UNCLE IVE:
I'm also sorry that this had to happen
During your stay with us.
You think your plans will change as a result of this tragedy?
Well, we really haven't discussed it.
I should hope nothing changes.
I mean, we just got here.
Look, I'm sorry the dude got cooked,
But speaking for myself, I would like to stay.
I don't see why not.
Well, I foresee no problems as long as they keep in mind
That they are here as guests.
CARY:
No problem.
Well, we've done all we can for now.
I'd like to thank you for your corporation.
I may have to question you further
Once the autopsy's performed.
Well, feel free to call me anytime.
[Music playing]
Damn.
It's called a Heimlich maneuver.
You use the Heimlich maneuver to save the girl's life,
Not the hymen remover.
That is something totally different.
That's what I said.
Hymen remover.
This is a pretty neat place, Cary.
I like this place.
Regular Motel Six.
Yeah, it is.
I remember coming up here as a kid.
I used to love to play hide and seek in this house.
Seemed a lot bigger then.
It had all these cool hallways and passageways,
All that shit you thought was real neat as a kid.
GENE:
Still sounds pretty cool to me.
Hey, why don't we all go play a game of hide and seek?
Better yet, Linda.
Why don't you and I go plat a game of hide the salami.
Why don't you go and hide your salami yourself?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And as soon as you find it, we'll find you.
It's gone.
I can't believe it, but it's gone.
What are we going to do?
We're going to find it.
Check his room or wherever else he may have been.
Just find it.
Will you be all right while I'm gone?
I'll be fine.
What are you watching?
I don't know.
One of those old classic horror films.
Oh my god, I remember this one.
It used to give me nightmares as a kid.
Oh, yeah.
I think I've seen this one.
Isn't this the one where the woman gets her head
Chopped off with an axe.
Oh, yeah.
That's it.
Oh, Gene, you gotta see this one.
This woman gets her head chopped off with an axe,
The head goes flying.
When it lands, you'd swear it was going to say something.
That's what I like about these movies.
They're so realistic.
Hey, man.
It could happen.
Oh.
Do we really have to watch this?
I am serious, man.
Think about it.
Think about it.
I mean, imagine getting your head cut off.
I mean, does it hurt?
Do you feel it?
Is it just a sharp pain and then it's over,
Or is it over before you know it with no pain involved?
Come on, think about it, man.
I mean, you're sitting there with no head.
You can't see shit.
There's blood all over the place.
Come on, think about it.
I really wonder what that would be like.
Gene.
Then go ahead and fine out.
But be sure to let us know, because I sure as hell
Don't know anybody who'd be able to tell about it.
Man, you think about it.
Because I'm serious.
Well, I wouldn't want to die that way.
I mean, I thought about this.
I want to go away as a hero.
You know, with style.
I don't know how, but I want it to be
Something that... something that people would remember.
I'm sorry, hey.
I want the glory.
Glory?
I don't find any glory in death.
I don't know about you guys, but there
Is just no way I want to die.
I mean, I've never thought about it and I'm not going to.
There's just no way I want to die.
[Dramatic music playing]
I mean, it's inevitable.
Sooner or later, we're all going to die.
None of us like to think about it,
But it's human nature to wonder about it.
Things like how, when, why, and what happens afterwards.
Come on.
We've all lost people in our lives,
People we've cared about.
And we've all wondered why and where are they now.
Are they happy?
Are they even anything?
I don't know.
I don't think I'd want to die a hero,
And I certainly know I wouldn't want my head to be chopped off.
I don't even think I'd want to die of old age.
I think of death as something quiet and peaceful.
I think of sleep, or even making love.

It's too late.

[Music playing]
Woo.
Woo hoo.
[Music playing]
Woo hoo.
[Music playing]
Sorry, Ms. Camden.
You may call your friends to lunch now.
Yo, Shelly.
Everything come out all right?
Cute.
Mr. Joverson, your house is really impressive.
I mean, I've never seen so many animal heads or skins
In one person's home before.
Where'd they all come from?
Oh, they're just a few things I collected over the years.
Oh, he's just being modest.
You should see his museum.
You mean there's more?
Tons more.
Oh yeah?
Can we see it?
UNCLE IVE:
Well, if you're interested,
I'd be delighted to show you.
No shit?
I mean, that sounds cool.
I can dig seeing Bambi hanging on a wall.
Gene.
Very well, then.
I would appreciate it if you left your beverages
Out here for a while.
Cary, would you ask Ms. Camden to bring me a jacket?
Sure.
Bet it gets cold in the museum.
All right.
[Belch]
Bambi.
Jeez, Cary.
You weren't kidding about this place.
CARY:
Hey, would I lie?
What's in this display, Mr. Joverson?
UNCLE IVE:
They're pre-Columbian artifacts, Shelly.
Well, where did they come from?
Well, most of it was collected in South America, the Amazon
Region in particular.
Isn't that supposed to be a pretty
Dangerous area for a white man?
Well, in most instances, yes.
However, my case was a little different.
CARY:
Didn't my dad tell me something
About you being a member of a tribe or something?
UNCLE IVE:
You might say that, yes.
What really happened was my pilot
And I were on our way to meet with an art
Dealer in Rio de Janeiro.
When we lost one of our engines, we
Were forced to make a... an emergency
Crash landing in the Amazon.
Fortunately, our descent was witnessed
By a group of tribesman known as the Nonspectas.
Well, they quickly befriended us because they thought we
Were gods sent down from above.
Without the Nonspectas, it would have
Been nearly impossible to have procured a great deal
Of what you see here.
CARY:
Jesus Christ, man.
You for real?
Shelly.
Come on, let's go play some volleyball.
Um, sure.
I'll be right there.
Right away.
Come on.
Lenny's waiting.
OK, I'll catch up with you guys.
You journalists are all alike.
If you're not writing, you're reading.
Come on.
Let's go.
OK, I will be right there, god.
Perfect.
SHELLY: "Interior barn, night."
It's a little dusty, but I think it'll do.
How did you find this place?
I've got my secrets.
What can I say, I'm a man of many surprises.
You ready?
The question is, are you?
I'm getting ready here, boss.
OK, gonna get ready, boss.
Getting off, boss.
Here we go.
Taking it off.
Boss, going off.
LINDA:
You like it?
The only thing that would look better on you is me.

[Explosion]
This stuff is sick.
Perfect for Gene.
I'll have to show it to him in the morning.
I wonder if he can read.
This is not what I call a four course breakfast.
Fruit?
Fruit?
A breakfast is grits, eggs, and butter.
No.
I supposed to butter my pear, butter my eggs or something?
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
They got all this fruit out here,
But they don't even have any ernge juice to drink.
Ernge juice?
You mean orange juice.
It's not important.
What do I got, the fruit of the loom or something?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Cary, where are your other two friends?
I don't know.
I thought they were already down here.
Well, you know how those two are.
They probably went walking or something.
If I was you, I wouldn't worry about.
Well, I suppose I can leave from fruit out for them.
Fruit?
That way, they can have it when they return.
That would be fine.
I'm sure it would be appreciated.
Did you find them?
No, we looked everywhere.
Yeah, we looked in... at every hill, cave, and valley around.
I didn't even hear them leave this morning.
Neither did I. I was up pretty early.
Don't look at me, because I can sleep on a picket fence.
I'm sure they'll turn up.
I hope so.
[Birds chirping]
MS. CAMDEN:
Do you have a search warrant?
Do you have any legal cause to be here?
I don't need a search warrant, Ms. Camden.
- Yes, you do.
- I'm only doing my job.
You are harassing me and you are
Harassing that poor sick man.
I'm not harassing you.
I have to ask you questions.
I have had enough.
I'm doing a job and it's...
Go away and leave us alone.
I'll be back.
Detective Benjamin, hi.
I'm Shelly.
Shelly.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I remember.
How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
Thanks.
It looked like you were having a problem with Ms. Camden.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of people get upset with our line of questioning.
What they don't understand is that it's all routine.
Although her reaction's understandable being that
This is a homicide investigation.
Anyway, what can I do for you.
This is going to sound really silly.
I...
I'd like you to look at something.
Please keep an open mind.
Sure.
What is this?
It's some sort of script.
Shelly, where did you find this?
In the barn the first day we got here.
This is going to sound really silly,
But there are scenes appearing where blank pages were before.
And I swear that the title keeps changing, too.
If you'd look at the first scene,
It's almost as if it could be about Mr. Thorn's death.
Tell me, which way is it from here where we found Mr. Thorn?
It's over this way.
Come on, I'll show you.
Has anything else you might consider
Strange been happening?
No.
Everything else has been normal.
Well, except I haven't seen Gene or Linda since last night.
It's over there.
OK, well just hold on a second.
Let me go ahead and take a look around.
Sure.
Linda?
And Gene?
Oh my god, no.
Detective Benjamin, get out of there.
[Wind blowing]
[Scream]
That was back in '71 somewhere.
I was a little kid at the time.
Big shit.
[Interposing voices]
Give me something to complain about and you jump...
Wait a minute.
What's the matter, Shelly?
What, what, what?
What's the matter?
Calm down.
It was just an earthquake.
Yeah.
Take a deep breath or something.
Come on.
What's this?
Detective Benjamin, he's dead.
This script is killing everybody.
Gene and Linda, too.
I know they're dead.
What are you talking about?
Have you seen them?
No, but it's in the script.
What are you talking about?
Ca...
Shelly, calm down.
Detective Benjamin, the cop, is dead?
Yes.
I just saw the whole thing.
You saw it?
Yes.
Where?
Where is he now?
Take us to him.
It's over here.
It was right here.
I swear, it was right here.
I saw it.
I swear I saw it.
You guys don't believe me, do you?
It's not that we don't believe you,
It's just that...
It's just that you
Have a pretty active imagination and this
Is a pretty wild story.
Bullshit.
Look, you said something about Gene and Linda being dead.
Where was that?
How do you know?
Did you see that, too?
No, I told you it's in the script.
It... it tells how it killed Mr. Thorn and... and Gene and Linda,
And I just saw it suck in Detective Benjamin.
And it spit him back in my face.
How can a script kill someone?
CARY:
Here.
This might help.
I don't know.
But I've seen this thing go through transitions.
I've seen written pages appear where
There were blank ones before.
And the title changes when it kills someone off.
What I don't understand is why we haven't
Any bodies, or even traces that anyone
Was killed in the first place.
Well, we found Mr. Thorn's body.
Why can't we find anybody else?
I don't know.
I'm not writing this script.
I'm just reading it like you guys.
Well, whatever is happening, we got to get over to my uncle's
House and call the police.
Come on.
Let's go.
Ms. Camden, we need to use the telephone.
Can't it wait?
Your uncle is resting.
No, it can't.
We have to call the police.
There's people dying around here.
Still dead.
I'm afraid that's not going to work.
If you'll sit down, I'll explain why.
But I'm trying to call the police.
I'm sure the script has rendered
The telephone useless by now.
Mr. Joverson, would you please tell
Us what's going on around here?
Gene and Linda are missing and I just saw
Detective Benjamin get killed.
I... who knows what.
Yes, Shelly.
I know.
And I'm afraid your friends lives may have been taken also.
You must try to understand what we're dealing with here.
It's not something the law enforcement
Officials can help us with.
Then exactly what is it?
Yeah.
You remember my telling you about my time in the Amazon
With the Nonspectas?
Well, several months prior to my last visit to the Amazon,
The Nonspectas were being pestered
By an American journalist.
The journalist was so relentless in his quest
To photograph the Nonspectas that they became
Frightened, and then desperate.
And they took his life in order to protect
Their clandestine lifestyle.
But shortly after the death of the journalist,
Terrible things started happening to the Nonspectas.
Feeling that it was the spirit of the journalist,
They deposited his remains in a sacred urn.
The urn was one that was used to contain evil spirits.
After they secured the remains in the urn,
Their lives returned to normal.
When I arrived, they explained to me what had happened.
And they asked me to bring the urn back with me
To the United States in order to return the journalist
To his native soil.
Well, I agreed to bring it back thinking
It would make a perfect addition to my pre-Columbian art
Collection.
So I brought it back to my home, disregarding the warnings
Of the evils within.
Then in the 1950s, shortly after Ms. Camden came into my employ,
She was cleaning up in the museum.
Without knowledge of that urn, she uncovered it while dusting.
At that point, the evil spirit was freed from its captivity,
And the life force of that spirit
Harbored itself in the script of the film that was
Being done here at the time.
That script was entitled "Victim."
"Victim?"
When I first found the script, it was entitled "Victim 67."
And now it's "Victim 70."
Do you mean to tell me that that script has killed 70 people?
Over the years, yes.
What the hell are we doing here?
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
You don't understand.
It won't let you leave.
LENNY:
Bullshit.
You want to see?
I'm getting...
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
UNCLE IVE:
We must contain the script.
It's the only way.
It's not my only way.
[Banging]
LENNY:
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Open.
SHELLY:
Don't touch the fence.
What are you talking about?
I'm going to get the hell out of here.
Now, you can sit in there listening
To honky tonky bullshit, but I'm getting the fuck out of here.
But it's the fence.
It's electrified.
Bullshit.
I just got through yanking on it.
[Sizzling sound]
It's in the script.
LENNY:
OK, I believe you.
Now, you said we have to contain this thing.
Well, what do we do?
I mean, how do we do it?
We must return it to the urn.
Well, let's do it.
It's not that easy.
My paralysis is a result of our last attempt to restrain it.
But... but it's our only way out, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, let's do it, then.
[Crickets chirping]
All right.
You guys wait up here while Lenny and I go deal with this.
Very well.
The trunk containing the urn is down the stairs
And to your left.
All right.
Thanks.
Come on.
[Crickets chirping]
It must be in there.
[Thud]
This is great.
Relax.
Well, go ahead.
I'm not sticking my hand in there.
Fine.
[Clank]
Cary.
That thing is shaking when you put that script by it.
Yeah.
I can see that.
Cary, man.
The shit is starting to glow.
Yeah, I can see that.
What the hell are you messing with it for?
I'm trying to get us out of here.
Oh.
Relax, will you.
[Explosion]
SHELLY:
I sure hope this works.
Yeah, you, me, and the rest of the world.
[Clock ticking]
Have you found anything?
Nothing that applies to this situation.
Our only hope is that we stopped it once before.
Yes.
But it didn't have nearly as much power as it has now.
What's going to happen to us?
I don't know.
We must remain strong.
If we fall apart, it will continue to strengthen itself.
SHELLY:
I can't believe all this stuff is happening to us now
Because of something that happened to someone
Else almost 40 years ago.
LENNY:
The whole thing is pretty unbelievable.
You know, it's a real weird feeling,
How Gene and Linda are gone.
Just yesterday, we were all sitting around together
Having a good time.
I know what you mean.
I keep thinking that I'm going to open up a door
And we'll be sitting there goofing around like always.
Look, I know it's hard to do but we got to face the fact,
They're gone and not going to come back anymore.
[Dramatic music playing]
[Crying]
It's all right.
[Crying]
It's OK.
Shelly, relax.
Here.
Try some of this.
Thanks.
I'll be all right.
I just need to rest a while, I guess.
We all need to relax.
Try and get some sleep.
I'll try.
OK?
[Piano music]
[Music playing]
[Splashes]
[Music playing]
[Squish]
[Scream]
It's OK.
It's all right.
It was only a dream.
SHELLY:
Oh, god.
Oh, god, you would not believe the nightmare I just had.
Oh, god.
It was just awful.
We've got to get out of here.
We gotta stop this thing.
If only I was writing that script.
Yeah.
That's it.
We'll rewrite the script, insert the scenes,
And see what happens.
Get serious.
Wait a minute.
What have e got to lose?
Is there a typewriter around here?
Is there a typewriter we can use?
Yes, of course.
May I ask why?
Yes.
We're going rewrite the script, insert the scenes,
And see what happens.
Cary, you cannot change that which has already been done.
No, I mean we're going to try and rewrite and stick
Them in and see what happens.
I imagine it's worth a try.
I'll get the typewriter.
Hey.
Hey.
LENNY:
Write a helicopter comes down and land in the yard
And we all get away.
No.
No, no, no.
That's ridiculous.
That would never work.
Write a... a bunch of cops come.
Yeah, a whole force of cops come and get us out of here.
That won't work either.
And you thought mines was dumb.
- It was.
- Yeah, well.
You the writer.
You figure it out.
Why don't you simply eliminate the power source
To the front gate by having a total power
Failure at the ranch?
Yeah.
Why not?
Great idea.
Cool.
Then we all drive out of here.
That'll be fine if it'll work.
[Typewriter sounds]
Come on.
Oh, god.
Oh, come on.
God, I hope this idea works.
It sounds like we tried.
You guys.
Say a prayer this one works.
LENNY:
Ya fucking hoo.
Let's get out of here.
CARY:
Yeah, hurry up.
Come on.
Let's get into the car.
Help me with my uncle Ive.
Come on, Lenny.
You'll have to get out of the car and open the gate manually.
Remember, the electricity's off.
The remote control won't work.
[Dramatic music playing]
CARY:
What the hell is that?
Hey, you guys.
Forget it.
The power's on now.
What is this?
Come on, man.
I've been through this shit before.
Ah.
Joverson?
Mr. Joverson?
Uncle I've, what's wrong?
This excitement's been too much for your uncle.
We have to get him to the house immediately.
Come on.
Let's go.
Mr. Joverson?
Hurry.
[Car engine]
[Rumbling sounds]
Just think positive.
We'll get out soon.
Ms. Camden.
How's my uncle?
Is he all right?
I'm afraid that he suffered a mild heart attack.
If given the opportunity to rest, he should be fine.
I'm going to make him some tea now.
I guess you're right.
Would it be OK if I went in to see him?
I think it best that you give him some time to recover first.
SHELLY:
Yeah, Cary.
He'll be all right.
Just give him an hour or so.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Would it be all right if I had some of that tea, too?
Of course.
This shit has got to stop.
Shelly, I'm going to go over to the old movie
Set for a few minutes.
I need to pick up a few things.
You want anything?
Are you crazy?
You're not going over there alone.
I'm going to go with you.
No, you stay here.
I'll be right back.
Just wait.
Cary and I'll go with you.
Shelly, it'll be all right.
There's nothing to worry about.
I tell you what.
What?
Let's check the crystal ball.
I guess that'll be all right.
Come on.
See that?
There's nothing to worry about.
I'm in the clear.
All right.
But will you please be careful?
No sweat.
Oh, Cary.
I don't think we'll be having a formal dinner this evening.
Would you like me to make some sandwiches
For you and your friends?
No, thanks.
This will be fine for right now.
Ms. Camden, thank you.
It means a great deal to me that... seeing how
Well you take care of my uncle.
It shows how much you really do care about him.
Thank you, Cary.
Where's Lenny?
He went over to the old movie set.
I tried to talk him out of going, but he insisted.
That wasn't too swift.
I know.
Well, we checked the script and there wasn't anything new,
So he thought it was OK.
Yeah.
I guess he'll be all right.
Hope so.
Cookie?
Thanks.
[Loud thud]
[Rattling]
Who's out there?
[Loud sound]
Oh, shit.
[Rattling]
[Thud]
[Scream]
No.
[Growling sounds]
MS. CAMDEN:
No.
No.
No.
Please.
Please, no.
Oh.
What do you want with... with me?
Oh.
No.
Oh, please.
No.
Ah.
Who are you?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Oh.
No.
Please.
Please.
No.
No.
Please.
No.
[Squish]
Lenny.
Lenny what?
Lenny, he's... the script.
The number's changed.
Lenny's gone.
Oh my god.
I told him not to go alone.
Come on.
[Crickets chirping]
[Music playing]
Shit.
[Music playing]
[Explosion]
[Music playing]
[Motorcycle engines]
[Music playing]
Something tells me that this isn't the cavalry.
[Music playing]
Maybe he made it back to your uncle's.
Yeah, maybe.
Let's go find out.
Come on.
[Crickets chirping]
Cary.
I can't run anymore.
I... can we just rest, please?
It's OK.
I need a break, too.
I can't believe we ran so far.
I can't either.
We did it.
Is it raining?
What the...
What?
[Scream]
At least we know that Lenny's safe.
[Dramatic music playing]
CARY:
Uncle Ive.
Uncle Ive?
Uncle Ive.
Holy shit.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry, uncle.
I don't...
Lord, he's in your hands now.
How we ask that you forgive his sins and let him rest in peace.
Cary, one must first be content with life before they can rest.
Uncle Ive, you're alive.
You're all right.
I...
I cannot rest knowing this aberration is wreaking
Its bestial behavior on us all.
Oh, thank God, you're alive.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
I... we're all in this together.
Uncle Ive, I have something to tell you.
It's about Ms. Camden.
She...
Ms. Camden, well... she was...
She was a very good woman.
She looked out for me.
She took care of me.
I...
I understand.
Thank you, Cary.
I...
I will miss her.
I'm sorry.
We know that she cared for you very much.
Cary, you must promise me one thing.
Sure, anything.
You must promise me you will beat this... this thing.
It must be put to rest forever so never
Again will it harm anyone.
Be careful.
Be strong.
Fight to preserve what soon will be yours.
I will.
I promise.
Well, how's your uncle?
Is he all right?
Yeah, he's fine.
Well, what's your hurry?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's just something he said.
What did he say?
It's time to go get Lenny.
[Whistling]
[Dramatic music playing]
OK, come on.
[Whistling]
[Twig snap]
Cary, wait.
What was that?
What was what?
That.
Something creepy.
[Groans]
Come on, you son of a bitch.
[Growling]
[Gunshot]
[Dramatic music playing]
Did you see the size of that thing?
Yeah.
Incredible.
Well, that's one down.
Two to go.
Come on, let's go.
Before they get Lenny.
Cary, wait.
You said something about your uncle before.
What did he say?
It's kind of far-fetched.
He said you must be content with life
Before you can rest in peace.
Yeah, so?
Don't you get it?
No.
This guy, this journalist, he was killed by the Nonspectas.
His body was cremated and stuffed in that voodoo bottle.
Of course.
He's pissed.
Exactly.
The poor guy never had a proper burial.
His spirit is in limbo.
Oh, great.
Now that we've figured that out, what are we going to do?
First we got to go get Lenny, then go back to the house.
We can try taking the script and putting it back in the trunk
That the urn was in and give it a proper burial.
What do you think?
It's worth a try.
I'll get started on it right away.
Shelly.
[Motorcycle engine]
Shel...
Oh, shit.
Ah.
[Thud]
Those motorcycle faggots is bound to hit one of these.
[Motorcycle engine]
[Music playing]
Oh, shit.
Over here, you... you motorcycle faggot.
Over here.
[Dramatic music playing]
[Crash]
Ah.
LENNY:
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Oh, come on.
Shit.
Dude.
[Scream]
[Engine revving]
[Music playing]
[Gunshot]

[Gunshots]
[Gunshot]
[Explosion]
No comment.
Where's Shelly?
She's back at the house.
Come on.
I'll tell you about it on the way.
Now, wait.
By giving this thing a proper burial,
Holy water and the whole shot, that's going to stop it?
Right.
Well, holy shit.
Let's do it.
I'm tired of dicking around.
You guys are all right.
Oh, what a relief.
What happened to you?
No, we're find.
Everything's fine.
Where did you get that stuff?
Oh, I hope you don't mind.
I went in to check on... in on your uncle,
And this stuff was sitting down on his dresser.
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, he's OK.
He's just resting now.
You're a mess.
What happened?
Oh, it's just a little out on the range.
Lenny, check the script.
Make sure we're in the clear.
He's all right, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's... he's OK.
And he'll be all right.
- OK.
- Blank.
It's cool.
OK.
Let's bury this thing and get the hell out of here.
Oh, let's go.
Ouch.
Hey, wait.
Don't leave me, shit.
Come on, Lenny.
Hell, if I knew that, I would've kept my black ass
Back home, doing all this shit.
Ow.
Shit.
Are you OK?
Don't ask me am I OK.
Come on.
Look out for the stick.
Watch out.
Watch out.
This damn shit.
God damn.
[Inaudible] last week.
Shit.
Are you going to help me or what?
I keep looking like a fool.
I ain't got time to be doing this shit.
CARY:
Come on, Lenny.
LENNY:
You guys think maybe you could find like a big hill
Or maybe a couple of valleys and a river too I could drag
This thing through all the way?
SHELLY:
Here.
This is good enough.
[Inaudible].
OK.
This is it.
This is the spot, right here.
Let's go.
Let's get this project started.
Man, this ground is hard Lenny, get me the pick.
Here.
I don't know what good it's going to do.
Ha.
Funny.
Now give me the pick.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is the only pick I got.
Tell me you brought the pick.
This is the only pick I got.
You didn't tell me to bring a pick.
- Yes, I did.
- You did not.
Yes, I did.
You guys cut it out?
He didn't tell me to bring a pick.
I can't believe we're fighting about this.
Fine.
I'll get the pick.
I mean, I drug this coffin all the way up here.
Why shouldn't I go and get a pick?
Thanks.
I do appreciate it.
Yeah, thanks Lenny.
I'll get the pick if you keep digging.
I'm digging.
Get the pick.
You still didn't tell me to bring no damn pick.
He didn't tell me to bring no damn pick.
He forgets the pick, and I have to go get it.
I don't get it.
[Growling]
(SINGING) Here comes Peter Cottontail,
Hopping down the bunny trail.
SHELLY:
So what's going to happen after all this is over?
Well, what did you have in mind?
What's that supposed to mean?
I better check the script, make sure he's all right.
Yeah.
And uh, I'll keep digging.
Yeah.
Cary.
CARY:
Yeah?
The only difference is is that it
Says he's now madder than ever.
That's got to be Lenny.
You saw how mad he was when he left here.
I hope you're right.
You didn't tell me to bring no pick.
[Music playing]
[Explosion]
[Dramatic music playing]
LENNY:
Come on.
It's scary.
SHELLY:
Are you all right?
CARY:
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hurry, you guys.
CARY:
Cover it up.
It's done.
It's covered.
It's enough.
Let's get on with it.
OK, OK.
Um, you got to say something.
A prayer or something.
A funeral prayer.
Will you guys hurry up?
SHELLY:
I don't know any prayer.
Ashes to ashes.
OK, OK, OK.
Um, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
May the spirit of this child of the Lord rest in peace.
It's over.
Oh.
Oh my god.
OK.
Let's Get out of here.
Come on.
Let's go.
LENNY:
Still didn't me to bring no pick.
[Crickets chirping]
[MUSIC AZHA, "NIGHT OF OUR LIVES"]
Good evening.
Police continue to hunt for the murderers on elderly couple found slain in their home one month ago.
Police believe there is no connection in that case and the bizarre triple slaying of three people found near that same location.
In local news two were killed and four were wounded when local bank robbers began treatening hostages--
What?
No, no, no!
Don't be afraid!
This time it isn't one of your nightmares.
This one... was mine.
Where the hell are we?
Ah.
We're coming to you live from outside the Springwood municiple courthouse.
This is the scene of the pretrail hearing of accused mass murderer, Fred Kruger.
The hopes and fears of this terrorised community rides on the evidence produced by the prosecutor,
Michael Deets.
Victim No. 5, eight year old, Virginia Croft, this is how she looked when we found her.
And her four year old brother, Michael.
He was found in this dumpter a block away from his home.
Victim No. 7, 6 year old Bobby Doyle.
We were able to identify him through his dental records.
Do you have any closing remarks?
Those slides are the only remarks.
They speak for themselves.
Save for the thanks that I and this community have for
Leiutenant Blocker who finally apprechended this unholy abberation.
Objection, you honour!
Excuse me.
Alleged unholy abberation.
Do not forget, if not for Leiutenant Blocker, his own children would be pictures on those slides, instead of sitting with his father today.
Attorney for the defense.
Do you wish to present evidence for remission?
I do, your honour.
I have but one exhibit.
Due to new evidence.
I've just been made aware of, I move for dismissal of the case.
I protest your honour.
You're out of order Mr Deets.
Counsel, approach the bench.
The evidence presented to this court was obtained during an illegal arrest.
Not in compliance with a Supreme Court Riling on the rights of the accused.
With great regret, I must grant the defences motion to dismiss the case.
Your honour, this man cannot be allowed to walk free.
Then he should have been read his rights at the time of arrest.
I'm as sorry as you.
But the law is the law.
If procedure has been followed this couldn't have happened.
Courts adjourned.
This is your fault!
Your screwed up and now he's free!
It's on your head!
Excuse me.
Where'd the hell did he go?
After more children.
This isn't over.
Not by a long shot.
Those slides.
Brings it all back.
Two years of hunting, chasing shadows, and for what?
Look at them.
Look at what he did to Merritt.
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep.
Nothing resembling a normal life.
He took it.
And I couldn't stop him.
- Daddy?
- What, baby?
Will Freddy be back?
You know, I almost shot him, Sarah.
So help me when I saw him near the girls I almost pulled the trigger.
So what stopped you?
I don't want to hear about Justice.
That bastard took my little girl.
You know, Mike, I had this funny idea the law was designed to protect us.
I've given my life to the law.
I've always believed in it.
Until today.
And if it fails like today?
Well then, it's our responsibility to be our own law.
Now, wait a minute.
Are you suggesting we all become a lynch mob, Michael?
I'm all for giving a man a fair trial.
But the stinking system wouldn't even let us get that far.
We take it from here.
Are you with me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, let's go!
Ah, together again.
Are you ready for Freddy?
Patience, tonight we'll have a little party.
Time to feed you some meat!
Oh, don't worry, there'll be will plenty to go around.
Freddy's home!
Tim.
Remember why we came here, remember New York.
Remember um, 18 locks on the door, armed guards in schools.
Pushers, junkies, bums, everything immeginable on the streets except decent people.
Sarah, don't.
Oh, but here we are in the land of white picket fences and PTA meetings.
Mostly what we wanted was a decent life for us and the girls.
You think I didn't want that?
What are you like them, you think this is my fault?
All I'm saying is that maniac is still hose on the streets.
When I saw what he was about to do to our girls,
I was too crazy to remember every stupid detail.
I know his rights.
What about Lisa's rights.
What about Merritt's right.
She hasn't been the same since this happened.
Where do you think you're going?
To the station to check security.
You'll be okay, I'll send a man by to keep watch.
Daddy, you can't kill Freddy.
You'll only make it worse.
Well, what about a street?
Alright, okay, thanks a lot.
Bye.
Well, all units report a great big negative on any Freddy sightings tonight.
He's laying low.
He knows we're watching.
Well, we're not the only ones.
What's that mean?
It's just that a couple of parents don't feel like waiting for Freddy to show up.
They're gonna find him.
Right, it's just what we need right now.
A bunch of vigilantees.
Hell, Tim, I'm just a little bit surprised that you are not out there with them.
You know, I came here because I thought one man can make a difference and he can, by upholding the law, not by breaking it.
Well sometimes you've got to bend it a little bit.
What, like them out there?
No.
No.
I know the law.
I know where it begins and I know where it ends.
Do you?
Yeah, chief.
Good, well take a unit and start patrolling.
And radio in if you spot any concerned citizens.
You got it.
God, I hate hick towns!
You must be starving.
Shout if you need anything else.
Thankyou.
That guard won't do any good.
Please not in front of your sister.
Mum, she knows better than all of us.
Lisa, stop.
Over here!
Good God!
Well, he's not here now.
This is Mary's.
My Mary.
Agh!
He's not here.
That means he's in town.
Unit 2 to base.
Yeah, what's up?
Yeah, Tim, I think I just spotted our citizen's committee heading into town.
That's all I need.
Their interferance.
Alright.
Bye.
Unit 3, this is base.
Hey, Lou.
Lou?
Lou, come in.
Lou, do read me?
This night never ends.
Lou?
Are you here?
Lou?
Are you here?
He's out there now.
Relax, your father's going to be home soon.
Everything's going to be fine.
He's here.
I feel him.
Look, you're getting her all upset.
He's come for us.
Please stop it.
I can't take this anymore.
Enough about Fred Kruger.
Hurry up!
Go around the other side.
He's picking up where he left off.
Run around back.
What the hell going on here?
Evening, Tim.
What are you doing?
Where's doing what you should have done?
You listen.
I'm going to him.
I'm going to do clean and by the back.
We're way past your book, Leiutenant.
You okay?
Everything alright?
Nothing.
Go inside and lock the door.
Freddy was here.
Honey, go back inside with your sister.
I'm coming soon.
It's alright.
Sarah, you know where the gun is.
Stay inside until I get back.
Sarah, stay with the girls.
Be careful.
Lou?
You think you was going to get rid of me?
Look.
Go ahead.
Put the gun down.
Take him now while I've got got the chance.
Drop the gun.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Drop the gun.
Whose side are you on, anyway?
Yours.
Do all of you want to be on the same level a this piece of dirt?
Doc, look at you.
You're a dentist, not an excutioner.
I've got a right to remain at large, cop,
I've got a right to remain silent.
Ha ha ha!
Are you listening.
I'm taking him in clean and legal.
Anybody that gets in the way can come along.
In handcuffs.
Hey cop, you've got pretty little girls.
Shut up!
We uh, we got interrupted before I could get to know 'em.
They'll like me a lot better next time.
Next time?
Let me kill him!
I am forever.
The law is the law.
But tonight the law is on vacation.
That's it!
Pour it over me.
I'm thirty.
You missed a spot.
Ha ha!
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, pig, I'd rather burn than fade away.
I'll be back!
I'm free, free, freeeeeeeeee!
We're all in this together.
The rest of the town knows nothing, understood?
You did the only thing a man could do.
That was then.
This is now.
Springwood's nightmares are just beginning!
Ha ha!
Agh!
It's another bad dream.
I can't save them.
Ever since that night.
Listen to me.
You didn't kill a person.
You killed some mindless evil thing.
The law doesn't care about the difference between the two.
Well, I do.
We all do.
You're a cop.
You killed Fred Kruger.
You were protecting our daughters.
The real nightmare is over.
We can handle a few bad dreams.
Okay now.
You watch your sister, Merritt?
Baby?
Don't worry about anything.
Look, if she has any problems, call me,
I'll come pick her up.
Don't worry about the other kids, okay.
They'll understand.
Is she mad at me about anything?
No, Daddy.
You know how she is.
She sees the school counsellor.
Twice a week and she says she's getting better.
Forgetting about Freddy.
Once more I'm coming for you.
Come on, Merritt.
Hey, we're going to have guests.
What?
The F.B.I. They think they can tie our boy Freddy into killings all across the state.
They're coming down here?
Our troubles are over, Tim.
They feel bad about Freddy getting off.
The mistrial and all.
They're gonna help us find him.
It's only a matter of time now.
They're not going to find him.
Oh hell, Tim.
These guys are pros.
Not alive that is.
What are you talking about?
A bunch of us.
Deets, the doc, some other parents tracked him back to his boiler room.
Cornered him.
We burned him alive.
I threw the match.
Hell Tim, nobody's going to blame you in this town.
Maybe not, but the Fed's won't be so forgiving.
I killed a man in cold blood, Gene.
What are you so worried about the Fed's for?
So they find a body, so what.
No-one's going to talk.
Springwood's too small, somebody will crack.
Somebody always cracks.
When they do, I'm history.
Not if there isn't anybody to find.
I'll go to the power plant.
I'll take care of the body.
Hide it good.
Leave that to me, Tim.
You're not a criminal, you're a hero.
You're covered as of now.
Damn it!
Gene to Tim over.
Yeah, I'm here, Gene, go ahead.
Tim, ah, a couple of our boys just discovered a body over at the power plant.
I thought you were going to take care of that.
I did, Tim, I swear.
Then, whose body did they find?
I came up here after we talked.
I found the body right where you said.
I hid it over here.
I even welded the damn thing shut.
Let's open it up!
Oh, Tim!
Open it up!
Getting ready to take the body out right now.
It can't be Kruger.
It just can't.
Gene, came down here before, took the body and hid it.
Now it's missing.
Kruger couldn't have just walked back here.
Wait, we've got worse problems.
We need to have a meeting with everybody that was here.
You, me, Deets, all the others.
The FBI is coming to town.
- What?
- Yeah, that's right.
So we'd better have our story straight before they get here, especialy if Kruger turns up dead before they get a chance to look.
We'll have a meeting at my office tomorrow.
You tell the others.
Okay.
They're bringing out the body.
Alright, thanks.
Oh, my God, Deets!
What the hell was he doing here?
He must have cracked.
Came back here.
I hate to admit it, but I'm kinda relieved.
I'm not, we're still missing one body.
Give me this.
Ow!
What's the matter, tooth problem?
Come on by the office tomorrow, I'll take care of it.
Tim, look.
Honey, are you alright?
It's all coming apart, Sarah.
The town, the people, me.
Tim, you're not a murderer.
What was Deet's doing at the murder site.
Are you blaming yourself for Deets, is that what this is all about?
Maybe he went up to check on the body, to get rid of it, but I'd already taken care of that.
I had Gene hide it.
When Deet's found it missing, maybe he freaked, had a heart attack.
Honey, you can't really believe that.
It's the only sane explanation.
Right now I need sane, bad.
Tim, come on.
Tim, relax, honey, it's going to be okay.
Tell that to the FBI.
I'd rather tell it to you.
Just relax, come on, don't worry.
Hey, I did the town a favour.
Everyone says so.
I was protecting my girls.
Listen to me.
This isn't fair!
Open wide.
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Nooooo!
I know what's real.
Leave me alone!
Not another dream!
Daddy, are you alright?
Merritt, baby, Daddy's just been having a little trouble these days, alright.
She talks about it, Daddy.
She talks?
In her sleep, when she can sleep.
What does she say?
Mostly she says his name, over and over.
Told me you killed him, told me you killed him.
Daddy.
Who told you.
Who have you been talking to in this town?
No-one, Daddy, really.
Answer me!
Freddy, he's back!
In my dreams and yours!
Bell rings.
I'll get it.
Girls, your ride's here.
Come on, Merritt.
Let's go!
Come on, Merritt, come on.
Tim.
We have to leave.
To go where?
To leave town.
Leave Springwood.
We have to.
Time, we have a life here, you know.
We need to get out.
Before he gets both of the girls.
Look, you're scaring me.
Even New York is safe compared to Springwood.
At least there you see them coming.
We'll go back, lock ourselves in.
We'll be safe again.
Will you stop it!
I'll call a meeting.
Tell the others to do the same.
When I get back, be ready to leave.
Tim, Tim.
Freddy's poisoned this place.
He owns it.
What's the matter with him?
What's the matter with him?
So, Lieutenant Blocker, you finally made it here.
Doc told me about that chipped tooth.
Oh, that's not why I am here.
Can you get the Doc for me?
Sure, have a seat.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
Here Block, just let me have another look at the tooth.
No, we don't have time.
It's just a temporary seal.
5 mins and we're out of here.
Alright, just make it quick.
You got it.
Just go down there, last door on the right,
Maryanne will be there in a minute to get you ready.
Sarah told me where to find you.
She called the office all upset.
What are you talking about?
Leaving town, quitting.
It's not use anymore, Gene.
As soon as the Feds turns up I'm dead.
The Feds?
Who said anything about the Feds.
Who said anything about the Feds?
What are you playing with me?
You did.
You told me yesterday the FBI is coming in to nail Kruger.
Take it easy, Tim, I hid the body just like you said.
Everything's fine.
Kruger's body is gone.
You saw.
We opened the trunk.
Yes, I saw.
I saw the trunk welded shut.
That body is going nowhere.
I'm losing it, Gene, I'm coming it.
Take it easy, Tim, You're just stressed out.
Everything's fine.
You'll forget about it in two weeks.
This is all behind you, Tim.
Relax.
Okay, Buddy.
I see you're in good hands.
I'll check on you later.
Doc will be in in just a second.
This will relax you.
You know, this gas, let's me see through your clothes.
It's just the nitrous taking effect.
Boy, it really is painless.
Now for the sodium pentathol.
Mm.
Getting the works, huh.
Oh, you deserve it, Lieutenant.
Now I want you to count backwards from 10.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5... 1, 2, Freddy's coming for you... 3, 4, better lock your door...
All those teeth.
I'm afraid they'll all have to go.
Tell Freddy when it doesn't hurt.
- You're dead!
- Big deal!
Noooo!
Agh!
Now there's a smile every mother could love!
What happened?
He must have had some reaction to the gas.
Oh, God!
Sweet dreams!
Whose next, you?
Or maybe you?
How about one of you?
Captioned by Grantman Brown
See if it's correct.
No need,
I trust you, Mr. Lin.
Remember, this is only between us.
I know, this is not our first co-operation.
Here's another big deal.
What's it?
See for it yourself.
Our Ta Shih Group is buying up this old building... and preparing to build a high class commercial complex.
We've come to terms with most of the owners... except this pizza shop.
Fix it for me, by hook or by crook.
Forcing them out?
No problem.
We can pay the compensation!
Well... how much is the Company offering?
$3 million from the authority.
Not so much,
$1.5 million will be enough.
It's up to you to fix it!
The less you pay, the more to our advantage.
Of course.
But you must hurry up.
A pizza shop?
It's easy!
Table No.15, add onion and sesame.
Take your time.
Table No.18, no onion
- Take your time.
- The bill, please!
Well, the bill!
Please pay at the counter!
Thank you.
Come again!
No.4, Sisters' brand.
$55.
Keep the change.
Thank you!
Well, have you had enough?
Yes...
Both he and his son are sex fiends... when seeing women, they'll forget everything.
"Smoking is hazardous to your health"
I'm not hiring you to smoke.
Go to work.
Your mammy's hot-tempered today.
You know she's named Empress Wu.
Let's have a ball game after work.
No, today's my parents' 30th anniversary.
I must celebrate with them.
You're quite filial.
- Sure, they are my parents!
- Darling.
Come here!
- Darling!
- Coming!
Delivery it to 6/F, 58 Shan Kwong Rd.
Te Pao Trading Co.
Mammy, why me all the time?
Could Lung go this time?
- What do you think?
- No!
Glad you understand.
I told you repeatedly, we must give our personal attention.
Deliver it now before it gets cold,
It may affect our reputation.
Go up and relax if you're tired.
I'm not tired.
This way, please!
Is Mr. Wu in?
I'm Chin Ta-chi, a representative of Ta Shih Group.
Consult my wife, she's the boss!
Chin Ta-chi?
Mrs. Wu!
What do you want?
I'm Chin Ta-chi from the Ta Shih Group.
Sorry, my shop's not for sale!
Your Mr. Huang already talked with us last time.
He's no longer working with us.
Well, the Ta Shih Group... is already fixed everything with the other landlords.
We're going to build a new commercial complex.
Now you're the last landlord.
Mrs. Wu, name your price.
Sorry.
I'll make you an offer if you don't mind.
See if you're satisfied.
We have investigated your case, you bought your shop and the house upstairs... for $385,000. 15 years ago... which was a bank loan on 20-year installments.
The current value is around $900,000.
As your daily turnover... is $1,200 with a net profit of $500.
This means $182,500 in a year of 365 days.
It's $1,082,500, including the cost of the premises.
We're now offering you $1.2 million.
You have nothing to lose.
What have you to gain then?
I'm anxious to put this deal through.
And when the new building is completed, you've the option to choose space for one shop.
How big and how much per square foot?
The price for this district won't be too high.
At most a little over $2,000 per square foot.
The place is about one thousand feet.
That means over $2 million for the same space here?
I'll have to pay more then.
Only a little difference!
Have you gone haywire?
My old shop's worth only a million... and your new one's worth 2 million?
We scraped hard to pay the installments... and it'll be paid up in a few years!
Now you want us to pay installments... for a new one which is still castles in the air.
How could I know, within these period, how could I going to live.
I hate profiteers!
Get lost!
You're stubborn!
Darling, you're OK!
Sure!
- Boss!
- Coming!
What else do you want?
The bill!
You don't want anything else?
No, the bill!
4 tins of soft drink. $10, please!
What?
$10?
$2.50 each?
It's only $2.20 each at the supermarket.
We're working only on a small profit... after paying our heavy overhead.
What a windfall!
Buddy, any business must have a profit!
Let me handle it!
Boss, take your $10... but give me the change for $9,990!
- $9,990?
- Well.
Pay us 10 grand each month... and you can do business in peace.
Isn't that protection money?
Take it for garbage money!
Four masters, we work on razor-sharp profits only.
We can't earn much.
Let me pay for the soft drinks, OK?
Damn, trying to throw us out with $10?
What are you taking us for?
- Buddy, let's talk it over.
- There's nothing to talk about.
Go to hell!
Damn you!
How dare you bully my hubby?
Eat!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Take this!
Tai Shan...
Charge protection fee now, kid!
Get lost!
Stop!
Outrageous!
Stay if you have the guts!
I'll kill you!
Darling, a relapse?
Take things easy for the sake of your heart.
How do you feel?
Go up and rest...
I'll pack up first.
Thief!
Stop thief...
Help!
Thief...
Miss, let me follow him for you.
Damn car!
Hurry up...
Sorry!
- Miss, are you alright?
- Yes.
Sir, please follow him for me.
My passport's inside!
OK, I'll follow him now!
I'll follow him with my feet.
Hurry up!
Stop!
You're finished!
Halt!
Shorty, you're a thief.
Any Family problem like... an ailing daddy, grandma eloping!
The elder brother is a fool, the little brother gambling and indebted?
Is there any such trouble?
I have full sympathy for you plight.
I've kept up to comfort you and to show my concern.
Are they satisfied... with what I said?
If so, I'll leave.
Buddy, are you letting him go?
You want to catch the thief?
Run now!
Thanks for your favor.
You're generous to help me...
- Helping people is a joyful thing...
- Go!
Thank you!
Oh, no, I mustn't leave like that.
I've thought it over.
Keep this for yourselves.
You don't need the passport, do you?
Give it back to me, please!
I'll reward you.
Here, it's all I've got.
Take it.
Thank you...
- How's it?
- You're lucky to have met me.
Only I can help you get back the passport.
What about the other things?
Forget it, they're not valuable.
Where are you going?
I was going to see my cousin.
I'm going the same way.
What's your name?
Diana, I've just returned from Canada.
What a coincidence, I'm Charles!
I've just returned from Amoy.
Everybody calls me Sonny.
- Just call me Sonny.
- OK!
- Let's go!
- Thank you!
Don't mention it.
You're all idiots!
You used to run roughshod... and claimed to be a fist fighter.
Now you can't even beat a plump woman.
Aren't you ashamed to see me again?
Let's go!
My cousin's returning from Canada today.
Go and meet her at the airport.
Then put her up in an apartment and let she live for a while.
Tell her I died some time ago.
So she won't come to see me.
Brother, your cousin's beautiful... but I've just sprained my back.
I must see a bone-setter now.
Sorry!
Don't go if you don't want to.
Don't talk too much, go.
Go now!
Who cares?
Here she is.
Should be this one!
- Thank you!
- Don't mention it!
- Drop in to see me when you've time.
- OK!
I live in front, turn left and right...
That Shuttle Pizza Shop on the slop.
- OK.
- Everybody knows it.
- OK, bye!
- Bye bye!
Anybody in?
May I ask...
Is Mr. Chin Ta-chi in, please?
Who are you, please?
I've just returned from Canada.
I'm Diana, his cousin.
You're my cousin?
So you're the girl in the photo?
Right, it was years ago.
I'm your cousin.
Cousin!
I thought you wouldn't arrive till tonight.
Well, I took an earlier flight.
I tried to call but there was no answer.
So I checked into a hotel.
Why take the trouble?
We're relatives.
Move into my house.
I'll help you to check out.
Move into my house.
Wait a minute!
Dad, did mom so cool to beat four at a time this afternoon?
Yes!
Those hooligans raised hell while I was out.
Had I been in, I wouldn't have needed her help.
Can you beat them?
No, I mean I could call the police.
Tse-shu, go up and take your bath.
I'm closing the books.
I'll do it later.
OK?
I must say 'no'.
Daddy, don't argue with mammy.
You can't win!
I won't!
Formerly your mammy...
Don't tell your son my story.
You're all ears!
- Go up after you finish.
- OK.
Take your bath.
You've fixed everything for me.
Am I so useless!
Mammy!
This afternoon I met someone...
Have you shut the gate?
Yes?
Listen, I met someone this afternoon...
Have you cleaned the floor, set the table?
Switched off the light?
Locked the door?
Switched off the ventilator?
Checked the gas stove?
Yes, I've done all these.
Oh, no, I forgot something.
You never change.
Serve the incense!
- I'm doing it.
- I've done it!
Mammy, I didn't light this.
Show me your right hand.
All fixed.
Right foot!
What day is today?
March 7.
Tomorrow?
March 8.
Anything special for these days?
March 8 is Women's Day.
Why are the lights off?
You must've forgot to pay the electricity bill.
It's Auto pay.
Daddy, mammy.
Daddy, mammy.
Let's slice the cake.
So you remember it, darling?
Sure.
You remember it too, daddy.
Yes, your mammy's birthday!
Daddy, today's your 30th wedding anniversary.
- 30th anniversary?
- Yes!
30th anniversary?
- You...
- Well...
Congratulations on a long and happy union.
One thing you should be proud... of in this anniversary... is having a smart son like me.
Good family lineage!
You two blow out the candles!
Good!
It's so dark, I can't slice it.
Let me go down to switch on the main.
Don't slice it till I go up.
Darling, are you alright?
Yes.
Darling, is it serious?
No, I had a bump.
Next time don't go down to switch it off.
Just do it here.
Your son's done it for good intention, please don't blame him.
Quiet!
Go in and slice the cake!
Come...
Darling, what a nice cake!
Thank you!
Take your time.
I'll go down to eat.
Well, we've been married for 30 years.
No wonder you can't remember it.
The shop has too many things to deal with.
It doesn't matter.
Well, forget it, but I meant well.
Didn't you say you forgot it?
Did I ever forget it all these years.
I wanted to give you a pleasant surprise.
- What have you bought?
- What have you bought?
- How vulgar!
- Me, too.
What a coincidence.
A married couple with 1 heart is "gold".
What kind of "gold" is that?
I bought gold to hedge against inflation.
I'm keeping it for my future daughter-in-law.
Me, too.
Well, let me save it up for you.
Hey, isn't it for me?
Yes, I'm keeping it for you now.
Hey, what's so funny?
I was thinking of 30 years ago, that night when our wedding took place.
Yes, 30 years ago!
You could still hold my waist, but not now.
Right you are!
Do you remember the first thing we did... that night 30 years ago?
Yes, but I don't think you can make it now.
Maybe not 30 years later, but I still can make it now.
What if our son should go up?
Well, stand by and I'll spring over!
OK?
Well, don't hold on if you can't.
I've put on much weight.
Me, too!
Hsiao Feng, how do you feel?
Put me down if you're not strong enough.
Put me down...
Daddy's still as strong as before.
Darling, your mammy's feeling sick.
Hsiao Feng... how do you feel?
- Darling.
- Daddy, what's wrong with mammy?
Dial 999, she's had a heart attack again!
Hsiao Feng, where are your pills?
I've finished all.
I'm going to get them tomorrow.
What then?
Have you made the call?
It's coming!
Tse-shu, it could be a stroke!
A stroke?
Don't scare me, darling.
We still have to celebrate the 40th, 50th, 60th and 70th anniversary!
Right... mammy, I'm still a bachelor.
You've to attend my wedding.
We worked so hard to get this shop.
Work harder to keep it going.
Let's work hark to keep it going.
Tse-shu, my only regret in life... is not having sat on a sedan.
Burn one for me after I die.
Darling, you're going to be alright.
Why's the ambulance still not here?
Darling, all my valuables are in the safe.
Safe!
Under that shrine.
The codes are...
- Hsiao Feng!
- Mammy...
- Hsiao Feng...
- Mammy...
Daddy, burn it now?
Yes, she's afraid of mosquito bites as well as walking.
She's fat with heart trouble.
We should burn the sedan for her before.
The sedan will save her lots of walking.
Well... have you bought the insecticide?
Is this the one?
Yes, burn it!
They're damned.
They know I don't liked walking!
And there are so many mosquitoes.
They promised to burn me a big sedan.
Now I haven't got it.
Mrs. Wu...
I shouldn't have blamed them.
Mrs. Wu, please enter.
What's this?
Oh, they really are thoughtful!
Go!
Hey...
What are you doing?
It's alright!
Attention, all dead!
After crossing the bridge, who died naturally turn left, those who died accidentally turn right.
Those who died for an unknown reason ask Enquiries.
Cross the bridge!
Fixed.
Let's go off!
Mrs. Wu, get off and go over to process!
Process?
Yes, you must process before crossing Broken Bridge.
Madam, traveling on a sedan at this age?
My husband burnt it for me!
You said sedans are out of fashion... then I tell my husband to burn me a car.
I have to go now.
Next time I'll come by car!
Sorry, madam.
What's your name?
Lu Hsiao Feng.
Lu Hsiao Feng, aged 47.
Husband Wu Tse-shu, son Wu Te-kao.
Did you die of heart attack?
Yes!
A natural death then.
Hold out your hand.
You can pass.
OK.
Fixed!
Don't cross on a sedan!
Depart!
Help!
I'm damn scared.
Get off!
Stop!
My back!
Madam!
Luckily I've got you for my cushion!
Nonsense!
You nearly crushed me to death!
Where's my sedan?
Where are my sedan and the carrier?
He's fallen into water.
What?
How come?
My husband burnt it for me!
Now pay me back!
You pay me back my bridge then.
It's no concern of mine.
You crossed it on a sedan.
You added too much to the weight... and that of the carrier.
So it collapsed.
Are you crazy?
Blame it on your bridge!
Don't blame it on me.
I didn't know I couldn't cross on a sedan.
Now my sedan's gone... and you're telling me to pay for the bridge.
Are you trying to bully the weaker sex?
You're bullying me!
Come on, someone's bullying a lady!
OK...
Madam...
Forget it!
Good, I don't have to pay for it!
Now what about me sedan?
Where can I get one for you?
Spirits like you know magic.
You can make one with a magic wand.
Had I known it, I wouldn't have been crushed by you.
What then?
How could I know?
The bridge's broken and you can't get over.
If I can't cross the bridge can I return home then?
I don't know, let me check.
What now?
Look,
"One not crossing it is still alive!"
Alive?
It means I can go back to my bubby and son.
Maybe, it's so written over here.
But let me check again.
Nonsense!
Take me back.
If anything happens, I'll report against you.
Let me try!
Mr. Wu, your wife is already inside.
You'd better push it.
Daddy, push it!
I can't.
Press it like you do a life.
Your mammy pushed it for me each time.
You'd better push it.
Mammy used to press it for me too.
Let's press it together.
Hey, don't!
Hey, don't burn me!
I'm still alive.
Please don't burn me!
They can't hear you!
Possess someone now... before they burn your body.
- How?
- Let's go!
Sonny, Tse-shu!
Sonny!
Sonny...
I'm your mammy!
Tse-shu, I'm still alive!
What now?
I don't know!
Let me apply for space for you... in the Refugee Camp.
What?
Refugee Camp?
Don't bully me because I'm female.
So long as I don't cross the Bridge,
I'm still alive.
You've burnt my body, give it back to me.
I must possess someone.
OK...
I'll give you back a body.
Listen, get me a good one.
My hubby has eaten fat pork for years.
I must give him something new for a change.
Get me a young, pretty.
- Tall one with a nice figure.
- OK, follow me!
How dirty!
Stop!
Luckily we're still in time.
Get going.
3 killed and 5 wounded in this accident.
Now choose one!
How about that?
What about this?
She won't die, she got a sprain only.
What about that one?
She only sprained her leg.
I can't choose neither this one nor that.
What then?
That one fits you beat.
She's plump and young.
Am I that old?
And I already told you.
I don't want to be a fat maid anymore.
That one then.
Her size, figure and looks are all first class.
They fit you perfectly.
She's Diana, 23, from Canada.
She's no parents, with only one cousin in HK.
OK?
Yes!
With such a beautiful body, my hubby will be madly in love with me.
I don't know your husband loves you or not that is your problem.
You must observe the rules.
What are they?
First, once possessed, you can't get over.
Second, you mustn't repent.
"Goods sold are not returnable"
Third, you mustn't leak the secret to others that means your identity.
What if I should reveal it unintentionally?
No idea.
The book makes no reference to this.
Good!
Anything else?
Yes, but this is only between you and me.
What?
Don't ever reveal this to the ghost officers, big or small.
Why?
I've helped you in private.
If my superior knew it,
I might get fired.
How am I to contact you?
Contact me?
Oh, don't!
What if I should be in trouble?
What can I do?
Where shall I appeal for help?
What if the hell officers... should question me?
Well...
Call me if you need anything.
How?
There's no phone number!
Light this and I'll appear.
One for each call.
Hurry up, time's up.
Daddy, use a sieve, not your face!
I know, but I can't make it!
Let's try again!
Coming!
Table No. 4, table No. 8.
- Not so hard!
- Table No. 16...
No. 6.
Daddy, are you alright?
Yes, but without your mammy things got stuck.
Open up...
Sonny, I'm back.
It's you?
!
Sonny!
I really missed you!
Close the door.
Tse-shu!
Close the door.
Tse-shu!
Who are you?
You don't know me?
I'm...
Daddy doesn't know you of course.
Daddy, she's my girlfriend, Diana!
She's just returned from Canada!
Oh, no, darling, I'm your mammy!
I'm your wife!
Well, I mustn't tell it.
Serve her first.
I'll go upstairs.
OK.
Good night, daddy.
Diana, why are you coming at this hour?
Why is it such a mess here?
My mammy has just died.
Formerly my mammy used to stand here... holding the pizzas and flinging them like magic.
She really was fantastic.
We can never learn it.
Now you know how sad it is without her.
Right.
Well, let me bring you tea.
Do you like it cold or hot?
Hsiao Feng, without you, we can't do anything.
Mammy.
Mammy, my girlfriend Diana's here to see you!
Kowtow to my mammy!
Kowtowing to myself?
Tse-shu...
Hold it...
Serve the incense!
Come on, kowtow.
Are you sure?
- One bow, two bows.
- Good luck!
- Three bows.
- Good luck.
Let's return the salutation.
Thank you, Miss Tai.
Tse-shu...
Take care of her.
I've to have a bath.
Wait?
What's she doing?
Daddy, look, she's so nice to you.
The water's ready.
Come on.
Tse-shu, go now.
Hsiao Feng!
Yes?
You females are all the same.
Am I a cripple?
Can't I squeeze out the paste myself?
Don't blame him!
He's a bit cranky after having been ruled by mammy for years.
You know, my mammy was tough.
My dad and I dared not whisper a word in her presence.
Am I tough?
I mean my mammy, not you.
We called her Empress Wu... behind her back Empress Wu!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You spoke so plausibly and volubly a second ago.
We griped about her when she was alive.
And now she is dead, we feel sad without her!
You didn't notice it till now?
I've always been feeling it.
A woman is the soul of a house.
I was trying hard to get a soul... and you appeared...
Listen, Sonny, I really am your mammy.
What's wrong?
It's not so cold!
- Well, come with me!
- Where to?
So you're my mammy.
Yes.
You're here to take care of me.
Sorry, it was a spur of the moment.
I'm so sorry.
Let me talk to mammy.
Mammy, thank you!
You've blessed us with prosperity.
We now have prosperity for the ancestors... and personnel for the state.
All the things we do that will entail grave consequences.
Now you can rest in peace.
You need not sorry about me.
Now I can settle down but not daddy.
Come to see him often.
He misses you.
Has she left.
No, she's in your room.
My room?
Open up!
Diana, open the door!
What's she doing in my room?
This is dad's room, mine is over there.
Does it look like me?
Sit down!
- Right foot!
- What?
What are you doing?
Let me clips the toenails for you.
What's wrong with you?
Diana, are you out of your mind?
You seem so silly.
You're out of your mind!
You still don't know me after what I've done?
Of course!
These glasses were my wife's!
I bought these earrings for her.
This was her favorite dress.
You're using her powder, her favorite cosmetics.
Get out now!
Darling, see her out.
You get me out!
Hey, how can you do that to me?
Are you out of your mind?
I'm your wife!
I've been keeping this long to myself.
If you don't satisfied what I did for you, why are you quiet?
I was nice to you and you said I was tough.
I took care of you... and you called me Empress Wu.
Have you no heart?
One more thing!
This photo's ugly.
Change for a nice one!
Hold it!
Why are you breaking my wife's photo?
Why were you poking us?
Well come on!
Get out!
Get out of my sight!
- Tse-shu
- Daddy!
- Get out!
- Tse-shu, listen.
Give me a chance to explain!
- No need, get out!
- You can't do that to me!
Take your things and go.
Get lost!
Daddy, please don't!
- Diana...
- Go up stair.
Tse-shu, listen to my explanation.
You can't do that to me.
Sonny, Tse-shu!
Tse-shu, Sonny, open up!
Diana, hold it.
I'll open the door for you when dad's asleep.
Stay!
Sonny, keep away!
Get out!
You have thick skin.
Tse-shu...
listen to my explanation.
Tse-shu, Sonny, open up!
Go to bed.
You still have to work tomorrow.
If I can't sleep, you can't sleep either.
I'm your wife!
I'm your mammy!
I'm your wife!
I'm your mammy!
Why are you looking like that?
We had a fancy ball below... and I played a vampire.
Do I look like it?
You nearly scared me to death.
Easy, you can't die now.
What do you want?
Come on!
The party will be over soon!
It was all your fault.
I couldn't cross the bridge and die because of you.
Me again?
It was all your fault.
You got me such a body to possess... and stopped me from revealing my identity.
Now none of my family knows me.
They thought I was already dead.
What then?
Madam, you chose it yourself, and I didn't fix the rules myself!
Why blame me?
Who else, if not you?
My husband?
Yama?
Goddess Kuan Yin?
Jesus Christ...
Well, blame me!
What do you want now?
I want my husband to know I've possessed another woman.
Fix that for me.
OK...
There's only one way out.
But you must never tell others.
Tell your husband in dream when he's asleep...
That you're possessing another woman.
Can I do that?
That's the only way out.
But you mustn't tell him... which woman you're possessing.
- What's he doing?
- Dreaming.
What dream?
He looks so happy.
Who knows?
Let's see.
Anything else to eat?
Braised pork, "Your Highness".
Tse-shu, I'm still alive.
My body was burn by you, so I've possessed another female body.
Who?
I can't leak the secret.
Anyway, there will be a female in the shop tomorrow, and she will help you to solve your problems.
That's me.
What bloody dreams you're making.
Get up, it's time to open the shop.
Already so late.
No. 16, add sesame and onion.
No. 8 with onion no sesame.
Take your time.
Tse-shu, are you awake?
Yes!
Why is she still here?
Luckily she's here to help us out.
No. 13 Man Kun Building, Jaffre Road, Wanchai.
I'll stay with you.
Let Lung deliver it.
What do you think?
Of course not!
We must give our personal attention.
You must be the same native as my mammy.
Even your tone is the same as hers.
Hurry up!
No one wants to eat cold pizzas!
That will harm our reputation.
Could she have possessed her?
Dad, Diana's so smart.
She can virtually take mammy's place.
I suspect she's your mammy!
Ridiculous.
Listen, she can be my son's mammy.
She can't be your son's mammy.
Even a father and a son may compete in love.
Oh, no!
Last night your mammy told me in dreams.
She hasn't died yet, and she has possessed another woman.
Stop kidding!
She didn't say that when I played mahjong with her.
No?
Table No. 16, sesame with onion.
How's it?
Everything fixed?
You real are Hsiao Feng?
Impossible!
Must be dreaming!
It's true, you're not dreaming!
Boss.
We're in business, brother.
You come in again and again.
What are you doing here?
Well, your wife's dead.
Now no one can protect you.
Who says?
I'm here!
I can protect him.
Don't fight.
Let's see a show.
Hell with you!
Ouch!
Did you get hurt?
Put me down.
I can walk without help.
No... 1, 2, 3.
Help.
Your wife has alive again.
Let's get out of here!
Why am I here?
No, she's not me!
Are you alright, sir?
Hsiao Feng, are you really back?
Hsiao Feng?
You're mistaken, I'm not Hsiao Feng.
Don't leak the secret!
Don't admit it!
You're mistaken, I really am not...
Who are you?
Why you look like me?
Who says?
Where are you from?
Who sent you here?
Diana, what are you talking about?
Where are you going?
Cousin, so you're here.
Cousin?
She's your cousin?
Yes, she's my cousin Diana!
Isn't that fatty dead?
Why's she here?
So you're posting her here as a spy!
- I'm not, I'm not a spy!
- Not need to argue!
You've imitated every movement of my wife... and it was so lively, even the way she made and flung the pizzas.
Luckily my wife is now back.
Otherwise, I'll believe you.
Tse-shu, I...
Don't call me that!
Get out!
I'm not selling my shop!
Lung, hold it.
Keep watch here.
I'll go out for a while.
Listen, I don't want to see you again when I come back.
Cousin, you've been here the whole night?
What a pet idea playing a fat maid as the undercover.
I'm not selling it!
Don't worry, I can make her sell it.
Tomorrow they'll be in a mess.
In a mess?
How?
We can't talk in public.
Let's talk about it later.
Come on!
Miss Diana, your purse.
Go and watch the shop.
- Easy!
It's slippery.
- I'm scared!
Help me.
Don't worry, we'll help you.
Help me.
You haven't put on your skates, sir!
I can't skate!
You can't go in like that.
Let's go.
Take your time to learn.
Careful!
Oh, it's you!
How shall I address you now?
I'm Chu Hsiao Hsiang.
- Miss Chu.
- And you?
I'm Wu Tse-shu!
Don't you remember?
- Let me help you.
- Let's go there.
Wait for me...
You know him?
No, I came upon him in the street.
Not bad!
A bit old, but suits you well.
Nonsense.
Don't you want it?
You've been longing for this chance.
Nonsense!
Miss Chu, I'm coming.
- What's there to see?
- Go out!
Mr. Wu, are you alright?
Yes.
- What's wrong?
- My hand...
What's wrong?
My hand's getting numb.
What then?
Let me take you to a doctor.
No need, but how shall I go home?
Let me escort you back.
OK!
- Come on, get up!
- OK!
Do you work here?
Cousin, did you lose your way yesterday?
You've been here, haven't you?
Keep my card and you won't get lost anymore.
You again!
Get her!
What?
How dare you lay hands on my cousin?
Just now she...
No more nonsense!
Come in!
You were scared like chickens... on seeing that fatty.
Now I can make her pizza shop close down.
Get me 500 cockroaches tonight.
No problem.
Are you sure you can make it?
What then after we've got the cockroaches?
I want you to put them all in that pizza shop... before nine o'clock tomorrow morning.
Then I'll call the Health and Medical Department.
When the Inspector comes, they'll be finished.
You're tops, boss!
Time's running out!
Hurry up!
Cousin, where are you going?
I'm going to see an ex-classmate.
Come back early for supper.
Have you got the address?
I reminded you of that!
Why so quiet and slack?
You're taking a nap!
Hi...
Lung, get up!
Mrs. Wu...
Don't fuss!
She's Miss Chu!
You met her this afternoon.
Yes, it's Miss Chu!
Sit down first.
Mr. Wu, is your hand alright now?
Yes.
Well, where's Sonny?
Not yet back.
Where's that brat?
Mr. Wu, I'll leave now.
OK, come early tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Darling...
Sorry, Miss Chu, let's go up.
Go up?
Where?
We live upstairs.
I won't bother you.
I'd better leave.
Don't!
Don't you want to see Sonny?
Well, sit here.
I'll get you the plaster and the photos.
They'll jog your memory.
- OK.
- Wait for me here!
- Lung, you're leaving so late?
- Yes.
Has Diana been here?
No, she hasn't.
But your mammy has.
Nonsense, it's scarcely a week since she died.
Lung even forgot to switch off the light.
Sonny!
Daddy...
So divine?
Amida Buddha!
Fatty, are you alright?
Keep away...
Sonny, come out!
I won't come out!
Mammy, I know you missed us.
We missed you too.
We wanted to go down to see you... but we must fix the shop and my marriage.
Some day after my marriage,
I'll bring my wife to see you.
Mammy, don't scare me!
I'm not your mammy!
Get up!
Sonny, what are you doing?
Daddy, how come?
Your mammy told me in dreams, she's possessed someone.
She can't admit it and tell us openly.
Let's not call her mammy now.
Mr. Wu, I know you two miss Mrs. Wu... but I'm not her.
I am not.
Don't admit it.
Right, don't admit it.
I'm going.
Aren't you going to sleep here?
Take it easy.
How can I contact you?
The Catholic Center, Happy Valley.
Catholic Center.
Hold it!
Let me see you out.
No need, I'll go back myself.
Let me call a taxi for you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
Daddy, she's here to see me.
To see him, not you.
What for?
Why's she looking for you?
Excuse me.
Wait...
The traffic's heavy here.
Let me help you cross.
Diana, where are you going?
I lost sight of you on my return.
How long has she been here?
No idea.
I've only just returned.
And she already left.
You've only just returned?
Why didn't you look after the shop?
Why are you here now?
Go now!
What's wrong with you, daddy?
- Don't you know who she is?
- She is Diana.
The cousin of Property man who's forcing us out.
She's a spy here.
- Impossible.
- Get out of here now.
How dare you throw me out?
I've always wanted to.
Sonny, come here!
Tse-shu, listen!
I won't!
Get out!
Sonny, come here!
Aren't you coming in?
Come back, or it's all over between us.
Don't come back if you dare.
OK, I couldn't careless.
I won't come back.
You've never been nice to me.
You're selfish, you never think of my future.
I never had any girlfriend.
Now she's my only girlfriend.
Diana, I'll get out of here with you.
I have to leave.
Diana,
I'm forsaking my dad for your sake.
I'll leave him alone to sink or swim.
Let him be an old monster and I don't care.
Bastard.
He's your daddy!
Don't curse him!
I don't mean it.
And it won't come true.
I'll pick another one if you prefer.
You must go in tonight.
What a shame.
You've been shamed before.
Right.
Sonny, Listen!
Get some insecticide against cockroaches tonight.
Cockroaches?
Yes, that property man's putting in cockroaches... then reports it to the Health Department.
Be prepared.
You dad's good for nothing.
What about you?
I'll go to his place to see what he's up to.
Don't walk into his trap.
It's dangerous.
It's unsafe for a girl.
Nonsense, I'll return early tomorrow.
Daddy, open up!
I'm sorry!
I won't do it again.
Cousin, you're back.
Where's my room?
That one.
Hey, come up quick!
Madam, what a nuisance.
I'm taking a bath.
There's another problem.
How come there's another fat woman here?
She looks every inch like my former self!
My hubby won't care for me now.
So, what should I do?
Ma'am, I'm only in charge of entry in hell.
I take no interest in mundane affairs.
What?
Don't wash your hands like that?
I rejoined my husband, but there's another fat woman.
He cares for me no more.
What now?
What else do you expect now, ma'am?
A shapely figure and lots of admirers!
I want no one but my husband.
Cousin...
Hey, what's he doing?
You'll see.
She's fallen asleep!
Thank Heaven!
He really is terrific!
This can only happen on earth.
It never happens in hell.
Nonsense, help her now!
What does that concern me?
No?
What are you doing?
I'm telling you to go eating.
The meal's ready.
- Eat?
- Yes!
OK...
What a nice atmosphere!
Sure!
Please sit down.
OK.
Thank you!
Cousin, drink it.
Try my cooking.
OK.
The mutton soup is OK.
Cousin, may you get a good lover like me in Hong Kong.
Come on!
Cousin, cheers!
Cousin, what are you doing?
I'm alright...
I'll go and get the steak.
- What shall I do then?
- Keep making fun of him.
Cousin, I know you like steak.
So I've specially bought the best steak here.
Cousin, are you alright?
Wrapper, scissors, hammer!
Scissors, hammer, wrapper!
It's alright!
I'm too excited!
Take it easy!
Cousin, care to come for a chat?
OK!
Cousin.
How come?
What's wrong?
Cousin, open up!
Cousin!
How dare you?
Are you out of your mind?
I'm coming.
I'm here!
Miss Tai, so early?
Come to help us?
Yes!
You've never been so early!
How does she know?
Tse-shu, Sonny, Tse-shu!
Diana, so early?
Where's your daddy?
Daddy?
He went to see mammy in full dress!
He even asked for one day's leave.
Damn him!
See if there are cockroaches.
There was none upstairs, so I came down to see.
Try again!
Even one could ruin us!
Lung, see if there are any cockroaches.
- Cockroaches?
- Yes.
Lots of cockroaches here!
A whole Army!
How do we do?
Wipe them out at once!
Damn...
I spout.
Anybody in!
What do you want?
We've received a phone call, and got a complaint about cockroaches.
Cockroaches?
No!
Have to take a closer look.
Go and fix them.
Please, sir.
I will.
What are you doing?
Nothing?
Open hide your mouth.
After my investigation, there're no cockroaches here.
It could be hoax, for who to make the complaint.
Insecticide can be harmful too.
Understand?
- Yes!
- That's all!
Thank you!
Everything will be fine?
Where's Miss Chu, please?
Lecture room on 9th floor!
9th floor?
Thanks!
Darling.
Darling, I'm here!
Mr. Wu, I already told you that I'm not your wife!
Sorry, I forgot.
Why are you here?
I want to date you.
Professor Huang...
I'm rushing to school!
We've invited an American Musician... to discuss with us!
You go first!
I'll wait you there!
Let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen, today's topic is... the difference between Chinese and Western music.
You see?
Western music has a shorter history than Chinese music, but it keeps on developing.
But Chinese music...
How shall I put it...
It's just like a dead fish.
This is a cool world!
I didn't say Chinese music is no good.
but it's in fact confined... to 5 notes only.
So it's cooped up... in narrow confines.
Western music can do what Chinese music does.
But not the vise versa.
Western music has variations!
Right?
I don't mean Chinese music is not good... but personally I feel it's out of date.
Ladies and gentlemen, Hungarian Dance.
What did you say?
Ready!
One, two, three, four...
We didn't say Western music is no good... but if you're a layman, don't criticize on Chinese music.
Let me tell you!
You've to know.
Yang, Yu, Ting, Yin, Chi 5 basic skills.
- You see?
- Yes!
What?
No cockroaches?
Are you blind?
Have you accepted a bribe?
There're dozens of cockroaches.
Take another look!
What did you do?
Inspector said there're no cockroaches.
But we did put them in the kitchen.
There're 534 cockroaches!
Right!
Buddy, no problem!
No problem?
Even the inspector said so.
You guys only know how to squeeze me.
We've to do something worse.
Go and burn down the shop tonight.
It's a crime.
It could be a fatal.
Nonsense, all other tenants move out.
You go and set fire at the back door, let them flee through the front door.
Only if they couldn't get up, and what if they couldn't escape?
We couldn't care too much!
We can't bear such a big burden.
Arson is a serious crime.
We can't go beyond fighting and scaring.
Sorry, no arson!
I pay you good, now you're pulling my leg when I'm in troubles.
We can't help you.
Thank you for your favour.
OK, you're loyal.
Diana, dinner's ready.
- Dinner's ready.
- Where's is he?
Who?
Your dad!
He must be having a good time with that Mom.
I told you she's not your mom.
But she looks like my mom.
She really looks like her.
You and your dad just like a fool.
He's giving up such a nice chance.
He prefers someone fatter than his ex-wife.
Were you very fat before?
What did that fatty do to your dad?
He's fallen for her completely.
And you?
I wonder why does she resemble my mom so much?
Most probably, she's acting.
If not?
She's either a plastic surgery... or she is a witch to seduce him.
First, she makes him spell-bound then wreaks havoc.
She made my dad crazy about her and listen to every word she said.
Finally, she kills him to destroy the evidence.
When you read a newspaper with a heading...
Blood bath at Pizza Shop.
The Wu family tragedy.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonny, we're back!
Welcome home!
I'll get you a hot towel.
Thanks!
Silver Fox!
Luring my daddy to get his yang... and his life.
Once he's spell bound... then you make a change and... kill him to destroy the evidence.
Then the papers front page will say...
Blood bath at Pizza Shop.
The Wu family tragedy.
- Right?
- What else have you got to say?
What?
- None of your business?
- Did your dad teach you that?
Dad!
Who taught you to be so rude?
Did you mom teach you that?
Who taught you that?
I did.
So what?
Why are you beating him?
What has he done wrong?
Why did that?
That fatty is not your wife.
You pretended she is your wife?
You old fool, scum!
Let me fight against him.
You're an old fool.
Why are you cursing your daddy?
Who told you that?
Who taught you that?
I must slap you in the face, kid.
I may curse him but you can't.
He's after all your daddy.
Miss Chu!
- Tse-shu!
- Diana!
Taxi!
- Miss Chu!
- Tse-shu!
Where are you going?
None of your business!
Diana, where are you going?
None of your business!
None of my business!
Open the door...
Please, open the door!
Mr. Wu, please go.
Don't bother me anymore?
Listen to me.
No need, just leave me alone.
I tell you one more time, I'm not your wife.
OK...
Please open the door?
Go!
I won't open the door.
I'll never leave then.
Please!
Who are you looking for, sir?
I'm looking for Miss Chu?
I don't know him.
She said she didn't know you.
She used to be my wife.
Go now or I'll call the police.
Go...
Open the door.
Please!
How dare you?
It's raining heavily out here.
Please open the door, I beg you!
Old man, stop shouting at this late hour?
You're disturbing us.
Go somewhere else to look for your wife.
If not I'll call the police.
Go!
Damn you!
There no concerns of yours.
He's not after your wife.
Take pills if you can't get sleep.
Go to hell!
Are you alright!
Creep, trying to murder?
Throw one more time if you dare.
I'm not afraid of you.
Closing the window, hey, stay there.
Come down and fight with me.
Aren't you bullying a woman?
And you think you can bully a woman.
If you dare...
Tse-shu, please don't go.
Listen, get out of my sight at once.
I don't want to see you whenever and wherever even in the hell.
I don't want to see you again!
Do I make myself clear?
What do you doing here?
I...
Go in first!
Have a cup of hot tea.
Thanks!
I...
Go on...
Sorry for what I said just now!
It doesn't matter.
I knew you misunderstood me.
Mr. Wu and I are common friends.
I know, I'm here to ask you...
Don't worry, I know what you mean.
I will not see him again.
I'm asking you to accept him.
Don't make fun of me any more.
We're both female.
And even you don't believe me.
No men would like fat women.
I know it well.
You're wrong.
Tse-shu is serious.
He likes you because you're plump.
He's a idiot.
Would he forsakes a young, shapely girl... for one of my weight.
He's madly in love with you.
He's serious.
Now I'd rather look like you.
You do?
I'm plump and clumsy.
When I was a little girl, I used to be call Fatty.
Now I'm like a Jumbo.
Submarine, Big Mac.
I even fed up with myself.
You must be kidding?
I don't like my own figure too.
But I want to be as plumpy as you.
Really!
Let's swap in our reincarnation.
Miss Chu.
Believe me.
Whoever you're, Tse-shu loves you all the same.
He doesn't like you, and I don't like him.
Why are you so excited?
Who are you?
I'm...
I don't know how to explain it.
Even I try, you can't hear it.
Why?
Don't tell me if you don't want to.
Even you don't tell me, I can guess by myself.
Come on, guess!
You're his student.
Are you two fall in love?
No!
His mistress... and his wife didn't not know about it.
Dare he got the gut!
No.
You're...
Try again.
Didn't you want me to guess?
Are you possessed by his wife?
I can't leak the secret.
His wife possesses on your body.
Right.
I can't say it...
I don't believe it.
What century are we in?
Reincarnation?
I don't believe it.
But, that's a truth!
I don't believe it, unless you prove it.
Proof!
I'll reveal it in dreams.
Close your eyes.
Count to 10.
Then I can prove it.
How?
Never mind, count now.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
This is a phone recording.
After hearing the beep sound, please leave your name and number, I'll call you back ASAP.
Miss Chu, I'm Sonny!
Son of Tse-shu.
Come quickly.
My dad is killing himself.
Come and help him.
Dad, don't...
Sonny...
Miss Chu...
Get up!
Why you hit me?
Never mind, follow me now.
Tse-shu is killing himself because of you.
Quick!
- Open the door!
- Mr. Wu, open the door!
Sonny, open the door.
Did you change the water?
Yes!
I go down first.
- Sonny!
- Open the door!
Come in!
Dad, they are coming up.
Dad, don't!
Mr. Wu!
Keep away!
Tse-shu, why are you doing that?
Let's talk it over!
Yes.
I've told you everything.
You were tough to us before death.
But after you died, we know that... you meant good to us.
And after you dead, we miss you terribly.
After we were told that you're still alive... and possess on some one for the reunion, we're so excited and waiting for you.
But you wouldn't admit it.
I've no choice... but to kill myself.
Mr. Wu, don't.
Listen to me, I can't admit if I'm not your wife.
So you're so cruel.
You won't admit it now.
I'll drink three mouths of the forgetful soup, and wait for you at the Broken Bridge.
Tse-shu!
Dad!
Tse-shu, are you alright?
Are you alright?
- Darling!
- I'm not.
You still don't want to admit.
You've so cruel to me.
Well let's all be cruel.
I've to burn down the shop.
I can buried with you.
Let me stop him.
Dad...
Calm down, please.
One more time.
Do you admit or not.
Miss Chu, pretend to admit.
If not, he will...
Alright, I'm Hsiao Feng!
She has admitted.
Why didn't you admit it till now.
Fixed.
Hsiao Feng, we're having a happy reunion.
Why...
Mom!
Is your neck OK!
- You just scare me to death.
- I'm fine.
Anything can be talked over.
I was more scared that you.
I'm alright now.
- Did I scared you?
- It's all your fault.
Diana, I've fixed dad and mom.
It's now between us.
Sonny, be nice to your dad.
I've to go now.
What did you say?
Come with me.
Everything in the safe are preserved for you.
You don't know the codes, do you?
Of course, I don't?
You do?
Of course.
Remember, triple 6.
Diana, aren't you my...
Fire!
Dad, fire!
Go!
Damn, the gate can't be open!
Go through the back door.
Quick!
Go up-stairs.
Go!
Quick...
Open the window.
What's the code?
Only mom knew it.
Triple 6.
Are you really my mom?
Finally you get it.
Open the window.
Open!
Sonny, jump first.
Go!
Don't scare!
Grab tight.
Jump over there!
Be careful!
Jump!
Are you Hsiao Feng?
I implied to you many time.
Miss Chu!
It's spreading up here.
Jump!
Pick us up down there.
Miss Chu, go now?
- You go first, come on.
- No...
Go...
Quick...
Jump.
I'm afraid.
Only 1st floor, jump.
I can't!
Jump!
Try over there.
Jump!
The hole's too small.
I can't get out.
Sonny, let's go up to help mom.
Don't, it's too danger.
Trying to kill yourself.
I've to help her.
Over there.
I might get choked anyway.
I'm scared.
I don't want to die.
Don't be afraid.
I tried it before.
You said you'd rather swap with me... when you're reincarnated.
Believe me, I may live again.
Hurry up!
I'm tired.
Can't help.
We're going off soon.
We don't have to die if we break the bridge.
Yes!
I've to possess Diana.
Yes and you possess me... so you can rejoin your husband.
That's great.
Attention, after crossing the bridge... died naturally to the left, accidentally to the right
- OK.
Cross the bridge.
- Thanks!
Wait!
Where's the moustached officer?
He's got fired.
Why?
Because of you.
He broke the bridge while he's on duty... and he went to earth without permission.
What then?
Don't worry.
Does the rule for "one've not crossed the Broken Bridge is still alive"... still apply.
Yes!
What's your name!
Come!
You've not processed yet.
Let's do it harder.
OK, to break it.
Quick!
Harder!
It's still in tack.
We're finished for sure.
Fate is predestined.
How you'll live is also predestined.
Some people die without getting sick.
Don't think you can break the bridge?
It's new.
It'll never fall down!
Good!
We can't cross Broken Bridge.
Why didn't you say it earlier.
I didn't know it till now.
Then the fire occurred.
Move it away.
No!
they may still alive.
What?
Even the corpses are stiff.
Don't move them.
Wait a little longer.
Crazy!
You're crazy!
Help!
- Mrs. Wu!
- Miss Chu!
- Hsiao Feng!
- Mom!
- Tse-shu!
- Sonny
Mom, you live again?
Mr. Wu, I'm Miss Chu!
I know you can't leak the secret.
She's not your wife.
I'm your wife.
I know you're Miss Chu!
You want to be my mom.
And marry my dad as his mistress.
Damn you!
Why you hit me?

Painting fighting in our prisons
It was like trying to collect all these energies which time had scattered.
It was to resuscitate all this life we had been given, to make it a force capable of helping our brothers.
And to transmit hope and creation to them.
Arrests, disillusions, all this time wasted to pay off all these crimes.
What for?
For nothing?
Which supposed killing frenzy was I corrupted with.
Death was not my life I
Will death forget me?
Maybe.
Since its creation the sun had been illuminating cities, embellishing my life.
I was trying to recall.
Armed troops in the jungle of necropolises would force their way sounding their horns.
The nights seemed so empty without roof, nor faith.
I would roam the boulevards, between drugs and you.
I would always rise from abyss to origins.
I would end up between two serials, screen doors, guillotines, my head dropped off on a bad luck day
cold Luger gun against my back, that night, down and depressed, between them and me, my hand on my heart and my heart in my hand, the door opened on a new world... where you no more were the same.
And yet in your eyes, the call of emptiness, this heartfelt and helplessness cry, the countryside was firing at its own joys, burying down our sweetest moments... and then we would forget the pain of war... and the misery of unnamed days.
Infinity is long to wait for.
And yet, in my definition of war, a sudden idea is slowly making its way.
Marie, Marie-Laure,
How possibly did you manage during this spring... to engender the best?
You were my first great love.
You, my queen, who passed your grace on me the very first day.
I was born by chance, ignoring the seasons, and the reasons that make you forget the four acts of age and then the disadvantage... of being and dying.
1987, the year of Prohibition.
My right eye is blur, my left eye can't hear anymore, my check-up is sure.
What I am sure of I will not die in the coming hour.
No old age nor death is alike.
Think of us two in the former days.
I just wanted so much to die and live the perfect time.
I must rebel I
Rebel!
Rebel!
Wake up!
Put back into my cell late that night,
I wrote:
Tenderness, quietness, privilege to dreams.
I met some brothers at the dead-end of the dead-ends where grief devours each day of the doomed.
I let my mind wander from principle to principle,
I liked birth, love... destiny, bedrooms, street noise.
The sea rose in the distance, overflowing with foam.
It's over there, I know, that lies the beautiful garden we sowed.
I got back to the city, motionless and alive.
I saw again neon lights had once known.
I began writing, when I would aimlessly wander about in the streets of Paris... to discover different life, another life.
I had given up getting a job.
I would walk the whole year in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, with my head bent forward to the pavement.
And this solitude in the heart of the city... is a true city within the city.
Saint-Germain, with its people, its classes, its rites.
Arrivals and departures.
The sudden and definitive disappearance... of people we would see at the same place for months.
The sudden appearance of other faces... to become commonly familiar within few hours.
A great need to speak.
The violent desire of poetry was born.
Oh!
Ma.
Ohl Mammal
When I see you back in the secret meetings... of our most beautiful recollections, sometimes so painful,
I have love for you and so, respect... and sincerity.
These memories no longer hurt even our shadows.
This earth fertilized our most beautiful years, and if I happened to surprise you, it was not by coincidence.
I deeply believe... not to have made mistakes.
I have lost and forgotten so much, especially those evtraordinary things, that would finally stop confusing us... in the meaning of life, the meaning which made me believe in us.
I?
Why give your definition of life... the ultimate meaning, of being and love?
Of fairness and the best, of beauty of life, the meaning that fits one, the meaning of conscience?
Having Loved you and far above that as well as our life
No old age nor death is alike.
The earth, I love it and I don't care about it
I am not a farmer who hides some radishes in a hole.
You, sharing the borders with the impossible, the exact meaning of semantics,
I, Pierre,
I plant the exact invisible of our infinity.
Subway, a bar, a drunkard.
It is not always easy to roam with tucked up sleeves, alcohol soaked walk, one's stench and heaviness.
Deafened by the song of innocence awaiting no fame, who is this fragile heart beyond melancholy?
I would have loved to be high...
Impossible to think coherently.
You are breathing, or rather starting to breathe again,
And then your eyes will stare at some point on the wall.
Why there?
There might be a scratch of the stone, a crack, a deep crack, a clumsy drawing of one of your predecessors'.
You started thinking again.
What about you, how many years for?
Two years?
Ten?
Twenty?
Impossible, that's absurd.
You've just had a brief nightmare, you were in an air-pocket, in free fall.
It is over, it's going away, we won't leave you there.
You get your refleves back, your mind is fighting back.
You must survive, you must hope.
You say to yourself:
It's the others, who die here, not me.
And you're slowly beginning to understand... that you will have to fight also against yourself.
In the middle of the silent night, one can hear screams coming up from long corridors... of that underground city.
The wardens slaughter.
The representatives of all races, of all classes of humanity embarked together for a long crossing.
You cannot get out.
The Flood.
One awaits the return of white doves... bearers of their message of forgiveness and peace.
A riot is quite a thing, war fear in your guts, silent-mouthed order, screams and rattling iron hitting the ground, slamming doors, the shrill of whistle blows throughout the nef.
The routine is broken.
From the hold to the gangway nothing works anymore.
Outside,
The Police, guns and truncheons in their hands, are waiting for orders to intervene.
Nothing to say?
What can one do in those hidden folds of time?
Nothing, maybe nothing, dying with time, the most beautiful memories will drown in time, eyes closed I am dreaming, I am thinking about you,
I am thinking of those ideas we would share, that morning I found you lying nevt to me, the coffee was dripping, and our thoughts diluting in the news.
It was a beautiful day, eyes up the sky,
I was watching the sun.
And then, when you know, that waking up is like vitriolizing,
I know that in my mind,
Not only kisses evist.
Mirror has transformed my life.
I could see myself reading in the future and in the past.
I could see myself hurt and yet miserable, happy to live, like a child among the spring stars.
My spouse's eyes, and my children's eyes, helped me to live with time.
I saved a lot of love for my friends, my father-in-law and my fathers.
And your nudity seized, without you knowing it, and without any disorder deep in the heart of bed... where we were together.
The bedroom shouted out happiness,
No surprise... because we knew you were there.
You said the right words, that were lifting me up to give you pleasure so often desired.
Here lies, Pierre Clémenti, the deceased was beloved, was perfect, to evcess.
And then!
And then be!
Perfect your way... and then exist again within the time you are given.
I, believe and believe me,
Something better should be added... what?
I!
Engraved in you,
I looked into your eyes,
I saw your face looking at God.
I had children myself... who I drove smiling... to the schools of unique.
Hard world and yet... what an ecstasy!
What a pleasure!
What happiness!
During all those days when I lived in Paris, the mirror was happy to see me, and the fact of seeing again, those entire hours of freedom,
I was so happy to live, I would sing those repossessed moments.
Sun!
Sun!
Smiling at me, what happiness to be having you in my life.
Well-being days, when you are so close to me, love was being born in the whiteness of sheets.
I, Pierre, since those crucial moments,
I promise you before falling asleep, and if my decline evists, if you believe it sometimes,
I, long lasting, Pierre,
I ended my joust with you.
I fear my pain interests you.
I will go as far as you are with me, the shadow of the crossing is gone... and behind me a flame,
I observed, a living sun, with the same people... who won't let themselves be abused by arrogance... facing the end of a world... endlessly endless.
I remember the words I would send to a shooting star.
Balance and unbalance break the harmony of hope.
I'm staying alone in the darkness, waiting for tomorrow to bring something new, but the spirit is getting tired with endlessly desiring the same thing, and the cycle perpetuates... like a slow death.
Because I know that tomorrow, nothing is going happen.
Justice is slow and evhausting, even if innocence is proven, it will still leave jail wounded.
Madness welcomes you with open arms as soon as you start realizing... that it might take months, or eternity, before someone looks into your case.
It all depends on good luck, and on whoever who would want to listen to your silent complaint.
All in all, to protect myself, I would withdraw, like a swimmer does, unevpectedly dragged down by a whirl, having only one way to get out of there alive, he lets himself drift inertly down to the bottom,
and then, gives a good kick... to come back up to the surface.

I, Pierre since those crucial moments I promise you before falling asleep, and if my decline exists, ifyou believe It sometimes, I, long lasting, Pierre, I ended myjoust with you.
I fear my pain interests you.
I will go as far as you are with me, the shadow of the crossing is gone... and behind, me a flame I observed a living sun, with the same people.., who won't let themselves be abused by arrogance... facing the end of a world..,
endlessly endless.
I remember the words I would send to a shooting star.
balance and unbalance break the harmony of hope.
I'm staying alone in the darkness, waiting for tomorrow to bring something new, but the spirit is getting tired with endlessly desiring the same thing, and the cycle perpetuates... like a slow death.
Because I know that tomorrow nothing is going happen,
Justice is slow and exhausting, even if innocence is proven,
It will still leave jail wounded,
Madness welcomes you with open arms as soon as you start realiring,.
that it might take months, or eternity, before someone looks into your case.
It all depends on good luck, and on whoever who would want to listen to your silent complaint,
All in all, to protect myself, I would withdraw, like a swimmer does unexpectedly dragged down by a whirl, having on Iy one way to get out of there alive, he lets himself drift inertly down to the bottom,
and then gives a good kick... to come back up to the surface.

Redwing, this is Zebra.
I've got you visual.
Over.
Roger, Zebra.
LZ your November Echo.
Roger that.
I'm popping smoke your eight o'clock.
You identify.
Roger, Zebra.
We're coming in to get you.
Got your smoke in sight.
That's right, you've got good eyes.
Now, come on.
Get us out of here.
Mama told me there'd be days like this.
I can handle today as long as I know there's gonna be a tomorrow.
Damn!
Medic!
Medic!
Let's get out of here!
We're sitting ducks right here!
Come on, get your wounded man.
Let's go!
Go, go, go!
Give us some cover fire!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
Man, I can already taste the sweet lips of those sexy little mamas of Bangkok.
Yeah, how did the three of y'all manage to get RR together in Bangkok, anyway?
It was sort of like the Miss America contest, Sarge, only this was to select the three handsomest boys in the platoon to represent the fighting forces in Bangkok.
Crummy job, but someone's got to do it.
Percell.
Sir?
I just got a telegram from the Red Cross.
Your father's in the hospital in Honolulu.
Hospital?
Yeah.
He had a heart attack.
Now, look.
Now, the Red Cross arranged an emergency leave for you.
Better go get your trash.
Pack it up.
There's a chopper going back to the rear.
You'd better hustle if you want to make it.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah.
Dr. Lyden, please call Cardiology.
Dr. Lyden, please call Cardiology.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a patient.
Vietnam?
Uh...
Ward, third floor.
You have guys from the 'Nam here?
Isn't that why you're here?
Uh, no.
No.
The patient I'm looking for had a heart attack.
He came in through Emergency.
He have a name?
Percell.
Jack Percell.
Hey, sarge.
What's going on?
I thought the two of you would be in Bangkok with a woman on your arm by now.
That's what we want to talk to you about.
Yeah, we figured with Percell going through what he is, it wouldn't be right, you know.
Why do I get the feeling there's more to all this coming?
We want to change our RR, Sarge.
What do you mean, change it?
Change it, Sarge.
We want to go to Honolulu.
Look, Taylor, you know you can't do that.
You put in for RR months in advance.
It comes down from higher up, a seat on a specific flight on a specific day.
Yeah, we know that, sarge, but we figured an emergency situation.
You know, Sarge, like you... you might be able to pull some strings.
Yeah, Sarge.
Percell's in Hawaii.
He needs our support.
That's where we ought to be, sarge.
Give me a break.
Excuse me.
Yes.
This is my father, and I was wondering if my mother was here.
See, he was here for a rodeo.
I figured she'd be with him.
So he's gonna be okay, isn't he?
Doctor's in Emergency.
I'll ask him to stop by.
Ma'am... about my mom?
The young lady who was with your father just left.
Been with him 36 hours straight, but, uh, she didn't look quite old enough to be your mother.
You let 'em know you're with the 196th, now!
Thank you, sarge!
Yeah, we love you!
See you!
Oh, God, sending those two guys into Honolulu with all those round-eyed women is just asking for trouble.
Yeah, it's like letting a couple of coyotes loose in a rabbit hutch.
Sorry.
I know you've been waiting.
He's stable, in reasonable shape, under the circumstances.
How did it happen?
He was thrown from a horse, broke a few ribs.
The shock apparently led to cardiac arrest.
Well, then it's pretty serious?
Oh, yes.
It could have been fatal, if Miss Garrett hadn't gotten him here fast.
He's been in and out of consciousness, but he's monitored, so we're aware of his condition.
He's going to be okay, isn't he?
It's too early to tell.
Why don't I check back later?
Thank you.
I left the, uh... the hotel room number here in case...
Where's my mother?
Montana.
I'm Jessie.
Jessie Garrett.
My mother's not coming because you're here, right?
Uh...
Uh, Danny... your mother and father have been separated for the last eight months, and that's how long we've been together,
Jack and me.
Why didn't he write me?
Oh, I'm sure he didn't want to hurt you.
Hurt?
Since when has he cared about how much I hurt?
The man's lived his whole life for himself.
Booze and honky-tonks.
Hey, he loves you, and I'm sure you care about him, or you wouldn't be here.
Yeah, well, that's a matter of opinion, lady.
Man, I feel naked without my helmet.
Lightheaded.
What is this orientation crap?
We've got to go to some lecture on how to act in civilization?
Hey, it's just a couple of hours, that's all.
You pick up a folder on local activities, what to do if we get arrested.
I see.
Arrested?
What, do they think we're animals just crawling out of some jungle?
Lord have mercy!
Look at that, Ru.
Look at that.
Miniskirts, man.
Is that too much, or what?
Oh, man!
The legs, they go all the way up.
Yeah, on a clear day, you can see forever.
Come on, we're gonna miss our bus.
It's been so long since I had sex,
I forget who gets tied up.
How you doing, fella?
He's gonna be pleased you made it.
Was it difficult?
Getting here, I mean.
Caught a supply chopper at Chu Lai as soon as I heard.
Bet you were glad to get out of there, huh?
No, I love it over there.
I love wasting people and seeing my buddies die by the dozen.
Look, Danny, um...
I am not some rodeo bimbo groupie, all right?
So don't talk to me that way.
I know soldiers are dying out there.
I think it's wrong.
I'm sorry.
Look, don't be.
I'm...
I didn't mean to pop off like that.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
No.
No, thank you.
Why don't you, uh... go get some air?
I'll come find you when he wakes up.
You know... he almost bought the farm in Korea.
He's been in more barroom brawls than any man has a right to.
Now he's laying flat on his back because he's still trying to act 19.
That's just Jack living life the only way he knows how.
When I was growing up, he wasn't around much.
If he was to die right now,
I'm not certain how I'd feel.
Thanks.
Looking fine, ladies.
Looking fine.
Moves that make a grown man cry.
Soldiers?
You got that right.
Protecting your every freedom from Communist aggression.
Well, we appreciate that.
Keep up the good work.
Oh, we'll do that.
We will.
Oh, chicks like that just yanking your chain, Taylor.
You couldn't get close to that if you were Audie Murphy.
Yeah, well, if Audie Murphy would have had my flash and talked my trash, he'd have made better movies.
You all right, fellas?
You all right?
What are they doing on the ground?
Hey, don't waste your dime.
Next floor's the only machine that works.
You been in country?
What's it look like?
Which outfit?
What difference does it make?
You'll like these accommodations.
You're overlooking the pool.
Well, it's guaranteed to beat our last accommodations,
I assure you that.
And U.S. Forces have had to move in inches...
Sorry.
The maid must have left...
Leave it.
Leave it.
Hey, where can we get some clothes?
Men's shop should have... whatever.
So for the third straight day,
The men of Charlie Company have tried to take this hill in some of the fiercest fighting we have yet seen in Vietnam.
This nameless hill outside a nameless hamlet held by the North Vietnamese...
Oh, wow, man.
Hey, Ru, they're talking about south of Chu Lai.
That's where our guys are.
Must be 40 miles of bad road down there.
The casualties here have been high, but the word has come down from above.
This hill will be taken, no matter what the cost.
I believe in peace, myself.
Well, if you need anything...
This is Frederick Danson with the 196th Infantry Brigade south of Chu Lai.
Let me get that for you.
I was with the Big Red One.
We was assigned to secure Highway 13 for a supply convoy, when we run into a hornet's nest.
NVA?
VC main force.
LT from One radioed for air strikes to help us out, but... the F-100s dropped their napalm short.
You mean on our own troops?
Yeah.
By the time the smoke cleared, half my outfit was ready for body bags.
The other half was running and screaming, fatigues burning off of us.
I got me a Purple Heart for my trouble, delivered by a desk jockey from Brigade.
Thought it would make a good photo opportunity.
Why'd they call the strike in so close?
Close battle, close call.
The zoomies said they missed us by only 50 meters.
That's all.
At least, that's what they told us, but what am I going to do?
Write my congressman?
Hey, look, I, uh...
You don't know what to say to me at all, do you?
You're choking up.
I guess I don't know what to say, except...
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
My...
My mother's flying in to see me, all the way from Georgia, but I won't see her, because I don't want her to see me like this.
Well, can I...
Is there anything you want?
Can I get you anything?
Yeah, sure, Sunshine.
How about a new face?
He don't need your sympathy, man, so why don't you just get the hell out of here?
Here.
Whatever it is,
I don't want to hear it, pal.
I just want to know if the guy was...
Harold.
He's got a name, man, and it's Harold.
Is he gonna be okay?
They gave him last rites twice.
If he makes it, what kind of future do you think he's got?
What about you?
You're looking.
You can see.
I did my duty, served my purpose, and now they toss me on the scrap heap.
How did it happen to you?
How did you get hit?
It happened when I made the stupidest mistake of my life.
I enlisted.
Anything after that's my own fault.
He's been asking for you.
Like hell I have.
Don't listen to him, Danny.
Always a tough guy, huh?
I used to be tough, but war eats tough guys up.
You a tough guy, Danny?
A killing machine?
No.
No, I'm just a grunt doing my best to get the job done.
When I went in,
I was lean and mean and hungry for a fight.
Too dumb to be afraid of anything else.
I found out that the only glory in war is surviving.
Vietnam, it's a...
It's a whole different kind of war.
More complicated than I thought when I joined up.
That's what they told us about Korea.
Said it was a police action too, not a war.
Somebody forgot to tell the Chinese.
It's good to see you, boy.
Can you stay?
I got emergency leave.
When can I get out of here?
Are you crazy?
You almost died.
Old soldiers never die.
That right, Daniel?
What about old cowboys?
Got something against cowboys?
You used to be one.
I used to be a kid playing at being a cowboy.
You know, there's a difference between being a kid and playing games and being 50-some years old and playing at being a kid.
Where's my damn doctor?
Dad, we got to talk.
Oh?
You gonna talk me to death like your mother tried to do?
I just want to know why you didn't let me know what was going on.
And I want to know, damn it, if I'm going to live or die.
Look, I don't expect you to understand any of this.
Jack and I have something together.
I don't want to lose it.
Did he tell you how many times he left my mother and me?
Just left us flat?
All right, that may be, but he's got a lot of good in him.
I mean, he used to be war hero, remember?
He won't let me forget.
Danny, you want to keep beating the past to death, man, go ahead.
Jack is so proud of you.
All he talks about is you.
Yeah, well, maybe he should have practiced talking to me, because as it stands now,
I don't have any idea who that man is or what he's about.
Maybe we can fix that.
You fix it.
I've had my turn.
I can't get through to him, he can't get through to me, so the hell with it.
I'm going back to the war.
Danny!
Hey, Danny.
How you doing?
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be in Bangkok.
Bangkok can wait.
Yeah, we figured you might need a little bit of moral support here.
How's your dad?
Oh, he's okay.
You sure everything's copasetic?
Oh, man, I tell you,
I ain't sure about a lot of things.
I came because I wanted him to know that no matter how bad he'd blown it,
I still had some feeling left.
Man, my old man split when I was still sucking on a nipple.
Last I heard, he was shacked up with some bimbo in Puerto Rico.
You know, Danny, maybe there were circumstances, you know?
Oh, right, Marcus.
It's all a bad movie, like the 'Nam, and it'll all be over when the lights come up.
Maybe you ought to talk more, find out where he's coming from.
After what he did to my mother,
I'd rather try and sandpaper a bobcat's butt in a phone booth.
Hey, can you wait, man?
Sure.
Sure.
Servicemen, huh?
Yeah.
How did you know?
Shoes and socks.
Black and black.
Dead giveaway.
No matter how duded up you get.
Don't let them rip you off in there, huh?
All right, Joe.
Hey, baby.
Don't you like soldiers?
There's an art to this, you know.
Yeah.
I guess so.
What you got on your mind, sugar?
I don't know.
Something that suits my personality.
That would be an extinguished light bulb, ma'am.
"Mother" is a real popular item.
Oh, come on, something with a little more style.
Yeah, yeah.
He needs something like,
"Live fast, die young, and try and leave a pretty corpse."
All right, how about "Born to kill"?
What are you, some kind of Hell's Angel or something?
I'm a soldier.
That figures.
Cash.
No credit.
You want extras, it's gonna cost you.
Extras?
I also do windows, honey.
Leonarda Da Vinci, Joe.
Check it out.
Leonarda's the friendly type.
Man, if she was any friendlier, we could have gotten arrested.
Where to, fellas?
Wine, women, and song, Joe.
Wine, women, and song.
Hey, like Sinatra says,
"Whatever gets you through the night."
You want to check out my tattoo?
You know, my grandmama raised me.
The main thing she taught me?
Ain't nothing positive come out of a negative thought.
That's right.
You know, you've got to go back, Danny.
You've got to get yourself straight with him, man.
What's gonna make this time different than the last six or seven disappointments?
He's blood, man.
You've got to respect that.
You know, one thing's sure.
These people aren't worried about no war.
You think they give a damn that we're out there dying and fighting in some jungle hellhole?
They ain't got time to worry about stuff like people dying.
They're too busy worried about getting an even tan or whether they've got the latest dance steps down.
You know, upstairs in the hospital, they got this whole ward of guys from 'Nam.
I talked to a couple of those guys, and let me tell you, they're pretty messed up.
Well, look, man, the way I figure, if there's a bullet out there with my name on it, then I'd just as soon have my family collect my GI insurance.
I'm not gonna go home with any vital parts missing.
Hey, man, check it out.
There's those chicks from the hotel.
Man, forget that.
Hey, come on, man, let's go talk to 'em.
Hey, what the hell, Ru.
Wine, women, and song.
How y'all doing?
How you doing, ladies?
Excuse me.
We're the soldiers you saw at the hotel today, remember?
Yeah, some of Uncle Sam's finest.
That's right.
This is Danny Percell, marksman par excellence.
Mi amigo, Alberto Ruiz, and I'm Marcus Taylor.
We're at your service.
Damn straight, glad to meet you.
Hello.
Oh, God.
Looks like an angel, speaks like an angel.
Yeah, but this ain't the Pearly Gates.
Yeah, well, heaven on earth's good enough for me.
Excuse me, ladies.
How you doing?
You got a name?
Leslie.
Leslie always has had a thing for men in uniform, right, Leslie?
Yeah, well, is that right, Leslie?
Well, with all due modesty,
John Wayne happens to be a wimp compared to some of my war exploits.
Is it me, or is it getting deep in here?
Hey, now, come on, Ru.
We can't deny the man his truth.
Girls, I have to tell you,
Marcus Taylor is a pure fighting machine.
I, for one, am proud to walk in the man's shadow.
Well, maybe it's a stroke of luck that I met you guys.
See, we're here on vacation from Stanford University, and, uh...
I'm supposed to be working on my thesis.
Thesis?
What's the subject?
Vietnam.
War or country?
See, we happen to be certified experts on both.
It's about American imperialism,
America fighting an immoral war, and our soldiers killing innocent men, women, and children.
Look, lady,
I don't know what you're trying to prove.
I mean, how does it make you feel to take an innocent human life?
How do you feel when you have the blood of babies on your hands?
Listen, you little...
No, Ru!
Let the lady finish what she started.
I think I'm finished.
Oh, no, you haven't finished, because I haven't answered your question.
Let me go.
When I pull that trigger, I feel a rush.
The power that I greased a gook, and the pain I had to do it.
You pull an M-16 on somebody, lady, you just do 'em... and if it's a woman or a kid, you have nightmares, but you do it, because you know if you don't kill them, they're gonna kill you.
Please.
It's war, lady.
We didn't ask to be included.
But you know what hurts the most is that we might die for our country in some godforsaken rice paddy, and people like you calling us baby killers.
Let go.
Take your hands off her.
You know, you people are such smartasses, you could probably sit on ice cream and tell what flavor it is.
Come on, group!
Hit it, Ru!
Go, go, go!
I got it.
Okay.
I need to know something, Marcus.
I need to know something too,
Danny.
I need to know what God's master plan for me is.
Am I going to be a movie star, or rock 'n' roll idol, or is my grandmother gonna be mad when I decide to leave Motown and move to Hollywood in a long, pink Cadillac.
Hey, Joe.
Yeah.
I need to know how could play it so cool when that girl was hassling you?
You know how many times
I've been called "nigger"?
Man, I wanted to punch her lights out, but once you hear
"spic" and "greaseball" enough,
"baby killer"
only raises your temperature a little bit.
You know what else I want to know?
I want to know what all this stuff is I'm hearing about peace marches and protests while we're laying our lives on the line.
Like that guy at the hotel throwing "peace" in our face?
Who the hell does he think he is?
Well, maybe the guy, he just wants peace.
Most people take peace over war.
Hold it, hold it.
You're Japanese, Joe, right?
Yeah.
I mean, we're over there greasing Orientals.
How does that make you feel about us?
Interesting question.
I'm Japanese, but I lived in L.A.
till the Second World War broke out.
You moved then?
Well, my family was moved to an internment camp.
You know, surrounded by barbed wire.
My brother and me, we later served with the 4-4-deuce regimental combat team in Italy and France.
Yeah, my brother, he was killed by a grenade just six days before he was supposed to ship back.
Your brother dies fighting for America while your family's in a prison camp?
When you reach my age, boys, you learn there are no clear answers about war.
We're Japanese- Americans.
Nisei, huh?
We serve proudly.
I'm proud too, Joe.
Damn proud.
I hate killing, but I love this country, so I'm gonna fight to preserve what all the wars before this one were fought for... but it bothers me what that girl said about us...
You mean, "Baby killer"?
Because it's true, Joe... and the truth hurts... bad.
It's war, Danny.
Damn it, let it go.
I can't.
I just can't.
It don't mean nothing, Danny, man.
Look, what does is that you're a hell of a soldier, man.
I mean, this side of sarge, you're the best in the platoon.
He's right.
Maybe even better than sarge.
Marcus, better than sarge?
You mean that?
Yeah.
Better than sarge?
No offense, Percell, but you ain't better than sarge.
I didn't say, "Better than sarge."
I said, "Maybe better that sarge."
Are you crazy, man?
What you been smoking?
Hey, hey, hey.
You don't have to get hostile, man.
All right, tell me how he could be better than sarge.
Okay, okay, okay.
So big deal.
I lied.
No offense, Danny, but, uh... now that I think about it, you ain't even as good as Johnson.
"And if you asked her"
"Why the hell she wore it"
"she wore it For her true love"
"Who was in the infantry"
"Infantry"
"Bum ba-dum"
Shh!
If you don't like what we're singing, lady, we do requests.
I bet you want to hear something by the Temptations.
Probably likes Elvis.
The King.
You know, he was a good soldier too.
Like us.
Steak and eggs, man.
I never got my steak and eggs.
I think I'm gonna have it for breakfast.
Come on.
Beddy-bye time.
Something to drink, sir?
Yes.
Martini.
Yeah, and a double zombie, pronto.
Yes, sir.
Well, well.
How you feeling, Big Spender?
Like I was led astray.
Oh, yeah, we dragged you kicking and screaming.
Hey, I've been thinking about what you said about family and blood.
I think I'm gonna go to the hospital and talk to my father.
Do you want us to tag along, Danny?
No.
No, I wouldn't want you to lose your rhythm.
Thanks.
Somebody told me once that if you marry the Army, you'll wake up one morning realizing you married a whore.
Now, that's no disrespect to the Army.
It just means it can suck you dry if you're not careful.
Understand?
Yeah, I'm trying to.
When I re-upped for my second tour, it killed whatever was left between your mother and me.
Oh, we made pretenses.
It went back and forth, but finally you have to decide that life goes on.
Well, how come she never tried to explain it?
What's to explain?
We're still friends, we own the horses together... and I'd like to think
I'm not as big a bastard as you think I am.
Hey, you know what I'm talking about.
I mean, when you get out of here and you get back home, it might be time to slow down.
Quit the circuit and trying to out-party the whole state of Montana.
I don't know, bud.
I'll take that under consideration if you'll make me a promise.
Like what?
That you'll come home safe.
Hey, you know, I figure, if you're a soldier and there's a war, the only one place for you to be and that's where the fighting is.
Yeah,
I know there's no guarantees.
I just want you to watch your butt.
War forces a man to reach inside himself and pull out a part of himself he didn't even know was there.
Well, you ain't looking at no hero, that's for sure.
Daniel... if you don't want to come home for me, then come home for your mother.
Do your tour, do your duty, and then come home.
Where's Howard, man?
Where is he?
His mother's coming in today, man.
His mother, man!
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He did it to himself, didn't he?
He did it himself, didn't he?
He pulled out his IVs.
We didn't catch it till it was too late.
Dr. Martinelli, CCU, please.
Spent the night talking with him.
You know, that never happened before.
I mean, the man was never around long enough for that to happen.
Did you try the eggs?
You've got to try the eggs, man.
No thanks, bro.
You queer or something for eggs, Ru?
We spend the night with these two dollies, and all he keeps talking about all night is eggs.
I was hungry.
Eggs are very romantic, Ru, if you're a chicken.
Man, I spent six months without eating a real egg.
When do you think I'll eat another one, huh?
You know, I talked to him about... when I get back to the real world, maybe he and I are gonna get a breeding farm together.
You mean, like, real, live horses?
Sure.
Start small.
Maybe after a while, give the big boys a run for their money.
You know about horses?
Marcus, I know about horses like you think you know about women.
You're in trouble.
Horses eat, Percell.
They eat and they eat and they eat, and then when they finish eating, you got to go in there and rake up what they just ate.
The point is, maybe it's not too late for me and him to get it together.
Gives me something to look forward to.
I want some more eggs.
Do you guys want some more eggs?
Now, these ladies said we were gonna meet us at the beach and we told them you were gonna be with us.
Yeah, well,
I think I'm gonna spend some more time with dad.
All of them will wait, except the one I had for you, the one that looked like Natalie Wood.
I just want you to be thinking about that, okay?
Oh, I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
Come on!
Come on!
Hey, what's going on?
You guys work in the deaf ward?
Security's in 503, right?
I hope they're up there.
Security.
Ward K.
Look out.
Security.
Ward K. Stat.
Come on.
Repeat.
Security.
Ward K. Stat.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Hey, what's going on?
Where's the keys?
Give me the keys!
Better call the MPs.
Hold on, let us talk to him.
He's got a gun.
We've seen guns before.
Where's the drugs?
I want my medication.
Give the cripple his medication!
Unlock the door, brother.
We just want to talk.
You unlock it, sport.
Go ahead, unlock it.
Hey, look.
Why don't you let that guy in there go, man?
You don't need a hostage.
No hagas esto, hermano.
No te metas!
Yo, let him go, man.
You don't want to hurt anybody.
You know how many people I've killed?
How much do you think they hurt?
Go on.
Get out of here.
Que tu quieres?
What do you want with me?
Nothing, man.
We're just grunts, that's all.
On RR.
Slumming?
Hey.
Remember me?
I'm the guy you talked to about Harold.
Oh, yeah.
Harold.
Sweet Harold.
What kind of chance did he have?
Ain't no way they could put him back together.
Look at the rest of those guys out there.
Who's gonna give them back their lives?
Who's gonna give me back my life?
We just don't want anybody to get hurt any more than they've already been.
Maybe we could talk to your doctor.
Yeah, sure.
My doctor.
What's he gonna do?
Give me a fresh plastic bag for my urine when the one I got's filled?
He gonna be able to explain to me why I can never walk again?
Or make love to a woman again, ever?
Ever in my life?
You hear me, man?
You hear what I'm telling you?
I hear you, man.
I want to come in there and get that gun.
I don't want you to do that.
Don't come in here, man.
All I want to know is why... was I sent where I was sent.
Why was I sent to Vietnam?
Why was I killing people and why were they trying to kill me?
Hey, man.
Hey.
That's what we all want to know.
Yeah, well, I got some advice for you grunts.
Desert.
Go AWOL.
Don't let them send you back.
You've got your chance, so why not take it?
Don't end up like me.
I hear you.
I hear you, man, but listen.
Listen.
Harold wouldn't want you getting upset like this, now, would he?
He wouldn't want this to be happening.
Harold's dead, man!
Dead!
He pulled the plug himself.
Suicide!
Think about your family, man.
You've got to think about your family.
Your mom.
Your dad.
What's more important than your family?
Now, listen to me.
I want to come to you and take that gun.
Oh, but please don't shoot me, man, because, hey, if I got to buy it,
I want to buy it in the bush, doing a John Wayne, taking about a half a dozen gooks with me, but not here, not by a brother.
Please.
Don't...
Don't do it, brother.
Don't do it.
Please.
Listen to me.
You don't want to do that.
Let me take the gun.
Please.
Let me take it.
Let go, please.
It's okay, man.
It's okay.
All right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You're all right, man.
You're all right.
We're with you.
We're with you.
Join the Army.
Travel to exotic, distant lands.
Meet exciting, unusual people... and then kill them.
Before they kill you.
You know, I've been thinking about what that dude said.
About not going back?
Going AWOL?
Yeah.
Our buddies are dying in some stinking mudhole, and we take off?
I wouldn't want them to do that to me.
I sure as hell ain't gonna do that to them.
Incoming!
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
Mayday!
Mayday!
We're going down!
We're caught in a crossfire!
Medic!
Medic!
[♪♪♪]
Redwing, this is Zebra.
I've got you visual.
Over.
PILOT:
Roger, Zebra.
LZ your November Echo.
Roger that.
I'm popping smoke your eight o'clock.
You identify.
Roger, Zebra.
We're coming in to get you.
Got your smoke in sight.
That's right, you've got good eyes.
Now, come on.
Get us out of here.
Mama told me there'd be days like this.
I can handle today as long as I know there's gonna be a tomorrow.
Damn!
Medic!
Medic!
Let's get out of here!
We're sitting ducks right here!
Come on, get your wounded man.
Let's go!
Go, go, go!
Give us some cover fire!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
Man, I can already taste the sweet lips of those sexy little mamas of Bangkok.
Yeah, how did the three of y'all manage to get RR together in Bangkok, anyway?
It was sort of like the Miss America contest, Sarge, only this was to select the three handsomest boys in the platoon to represent the fighting forces in Bangkok.
Crummy job, but someone's got to do it.
Percell.
Sir?
I just got a telegram from the Red Cross.
Your father's in the hospital in Honolulu.
Hospital?
Yeah.
He had a heart attack.
Now, look.
Now, the Red Cross arranged an emergency leave for you.
Better go get your trash.
Pack it up.
There's a chopper going back to the rear.
You'd better hustle if you want to make it.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah.
Dr. Lyden, please call Cardiology.
Dr. Lyden, please call Cardiology.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a patient.
Vietnam?
Uh...
Ward, third floor.
You have guys from the 'Nam here?
Isn't that why you're here?
Uh, no.
No.
The patient I'm looking for had a heart attack.
He came in through Emergency.
He have a name?
Percell.
Jack Percell.
Hey, sarge.
What's going on?
I thought the two of you would be in Bangkok with a woman on your arm by now.
That's what we want to talk to you about.
Yeah, we figured with Percell going through what he is, it wouldn't be right, you know.
Why do I get the feeling there's more to all this coming?
We want to change our RR, Sarge.
What do you mean, change it?
Change it, Sarge.
We want to go to Honolulu.
Look, Taylor, you know you can't do that.
You put in for RR months in advance.
It comes down from higher up, a seat on a specific flight on a specific day.
Yeah, we know that, sarge, but we figured an emergency situation.
You know, Sarge, like you... you might be able to pull some strings.
Yeah, Sarge.
Percell's in Hawaii.
He needs our support.
That's where we ought to be, sarge.
Give me a break.
Excuse me.
Yes.
This is my father, and I was wondering if my mother was here.
See, he was here for a rodeo.
I figured she'd be with him.
So he's gonna be okay, isn't he?
Doctor's in Emergency.
I'll ask him to stop by.
Ma'am... about my mom?
The young lady who was with your father just left.
Been with him 36 hours straight, but, uh, she didn't look quite old enough to be your mother.
You let 'em know you're with the 196th, now!
Thank you, sarge!
Yeah, we love you!
See you!
Oh, God, sending those two guys into Honolulu with all those round-eyed women is just asking for trouble.
Yeah, it's like letting a couple of coyotes loose in a rabbit hutch.
Sorry.
I know you've been waiting.
He's stable, in reasonable shape, under the circumstances.
How did it happen?
He was thrown from a horse, broke a few ribs.
The shock apparently led to cardiac arrest.
Well, then it's pretty serious?
Oh, yes.
It could have been fatal, if Miss Garrett hadn't gotten him here fast.
He's been in and out of consciousness, but he's monitored, so we're aware of his condition.
He's going to be okay, isn't he?
It's too early to tell.
Why don't I check back later?
Thank you.
I left the, uh... the hotel room number here in case--
Where's my mother?
Montana.
I'm Jessie.
Jessie Garrett.
My mother's not coming because you're here, right?
Uh...
Uh, Danny... your mother and father have been separated for the last eight months, and that's how long we've been together,
Jack and me.
Why didn't he write me?
Oh, I'm sure he didn't want to hurt you.
Hurt?
Since when has he cared about how much I hurt?
The man's lived his whole life for himself.
Booze and honky-tonks.
Hey, he loves you, and I'm sure you care about him, or you wouldn't be here.
Yeah, well, that's a matter of opinion, lady.
[♪♪♪]
Man, I feel naked without my helmet.
Lightheaded.
What is this orientation crap?
We've got to go to some lecture on how to act in civilization?
Hey, it's just a couple of hours, that's all.
You pick up a folder on local activities, what to do if we get arrested.
I see.
Arrested?
What, do they think we're animals just crawling out of some jungle?
Lord have mercy!
Look at that, Ru.
Look at that.
Miniskirts, man.
Is that too much, or what?
Oh, man!
The legs, they go all the way up.
Yeah, on a clear day, you can see forever.
Come on, we're gonna miss our bus.
It's been so long since I had sex,
I forget who gets tied up.
How you doing, fella?
He's gonna be pleased you made it.
Was it difficult?
Getting here, I mean.
Caught a supply chopper at Chu Lai as soon as I heard.
Bet you were glad to get out of there, huh?
No, I love it over there.
I love wasting people and seeing my buddies die by the dozen.
Look, Danny, um...
I am not some rodeo bimbo groupie, all right?
So don't talk to me that way.
I know soldiers are dying out there.
I think it's wrong.
I'm sorry.
Look, don't be.
I'm...
I didn't mean to pop off like that.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
No.
No, thank you.
Why don't you, uh... go get some air?
I'll come find you when he wakes up.
You know... he almost bought the farm in Korea.
He's been in more barroom brawls than any man has a right to.
Now he's laying flat on his back because he's still trying to act 19.
That's just Jack living life the only way he knows how.
When I was growing up, he wasn't around much.
If he was to die right now,
I'm not certain how I'd feel.
[♪♪♪]
Thanks.
Looking fine, ladies.
Looking fine.
Moves that make a grown man cry.
Soldiers?
You got that right.
Protecting your every freedom from Communist aggression.
Well, we appreciate that.
Keep up the good work.
Oh, we'll do that.
We will.
Oh, chicks like that just yanking your chain, Taylor.
You couldn't get close to that if you were Audie Murphy.
Yeah, well, if Audie Murphy would have had my flash and talked my trash, he'd have made better movies.
[LOUD BANG]
[BANG]
You all right, fellas?
You all right?
What are they doing on the ground?
Hey, don't waste your dime.
Next floor's the only machine that works.
You been in country?
What's it look like?
Which outfit?
What difference does it make?
You'll like these accommodations.
You're overlooking the pool.
Well, it's guaranteed to beat our last accommodations,
I assure you that.
NEWS ANCHOR:
And U.S. Forces have had to move in inches--
Sorry.
The maid must have left--
Leave it.
Leave it.
Hey, where can we get some clothes?
Men's shop should have... whatever.
So for the third straight day,
The men of Charlie Company have tried to take this hill in some of the fiercest fighting we have yet seen in Vietnam.
This nameless hill outside a nameless hamlet held by the North Vietnamese...
Oh, wow, man.
Hey, Ru, they're talking about south of Chu Lai.
That's where our guys are.
Must be 40 miles of bad road down there.
The casualties here have been high, but the word has come down from above.
This hill will be taken, no matter what the cost.
I believe in peace, myself.
Well, if you need anything...
This is Frederick Danson with the 196th Infantry Brigade south of Chu Lai.
Let me get that for you.
I was with the Big Red One.
We was assigned to secure Highway 13 for a supply convoy, when we run into a hornet's nest.
NVA?
VC main force.
LT from One radioed for air strikes to help us out, but... the F-100s dropped their napalm short.
You mean on our own troops?
Yeah.
By the time the smoke cleared, half my outfit was ready for body bags.
The other half was running and screaming, fatigues burning off of us.
I got me a Purple Heart for my trouble, delivered by a desk jockey from Brigade.
Thought it would make a good photo opportunity.
Why'd they call the strike in so close?
Close battle, close call.
The zoomies said they missed us by only 50 meters.
That's all.
At least, that's what they told us, but what am I going to do?
Write my congressman?
Hey, look, I, uh...
You don't know what to say to me at all, do you?
You're choking up.
I guess I don't know what to say, except...
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
My...
My mother's flying in to see me, all the way from Georgia, but I won't see her, because I don't want her to see me like this.
Well, can I...
Is there anything you want?
Can I get you anything?
Yeah, sure, Sunshine.
How about a new face?
He don't need your sympathy, man, so why don't you just get the hell out of here?
Here.
Whatever it is,
I don't want to hear it, pal.
I just want to know if the guy was--
Harold.
He's got a name, man, and it's Harold.
Is he gonna be okay?
They gave him last rites twice.
If he makes it, what kind of future do you think he's got?
What about you?
You're looking.
You can see.
I did my duty, served my purpose, and now they toss me on the scrap heap.
How did it happen to you?
How did you get hit?
It happened when I made the stupidest mistake of my life.
I enlisted.
Anything after that's my own fault.
He's been asking for you.
Like hell I have.
Don't listen to him, Danny.
Always a tough guy, huh?
I used to be tough, but war eats tough guys up.
You a tough guy, Danny?
A killing machine?
No.
No, I'm just a grunt doing my best to get the job done.
When I went in,
I was lean and mean and hungry for a fight.
Too dumb to be afraid of anything else.
I found out that the only glory in war is surviving.
Vietnam, it's a...
It's a whole different kind of war.
More complicated than I thought when I joined up.
That's what they told us about Korea.
Said it was a police action too, not a war.
Somebody forgot to tell the Chinese.
It's good to see you, boy.
Can you stay?
I got emergency leave.
When can I get out of here?
Are you crazy?
You almost died.
Old soldiers never die.
That right, Daniel?
What about old cowboys?
Got something against cowboys?
You used to be one.
I used to be a kid playing at being a cowboy.
You know, there's a difference between being a kid and playing games and being 50-some years old and playing at being a kid.
Where's my damn doctor?
Dad, we got to talk.
Oh?
You gonna talk me to death like your mother tried to do?
I just want to know why you didn't let me know what was going on.
And I want to know, damn it, if I'm going to live or die.
Look, I don't expect you to understand any of this.
Jack and I have something together.
I don't want to lose it.
Did he tell you how many times he left my mother and me?
Just left us flat?
All right, that may be, but he's got a lot of good in him.
I mean, he used to be war hero, remember?
He won't let me forget.
Danny, you want to keep beating the past to death, man, go ahead.
Jack is so proud of you.
All he talks about is you.
Yeah, well, maybe he should have practiced talking to me, because as it stands now,
I don't have any idea who that man is or what he's about.
Maybe we can fix that.
You fix it.
I've had my turn.
I can't get through to him, he can't get through to me, so the hell with it.
I'm going back to the war.
Danny!
Hey, Danny.
How you doing?
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be in Bangkok.
Bangkok can wait.
Yeah, we figured you might need a little bit of moral support here.
How's your dad?
Oh, he's okay.
You sure everything's copasetic?
Oh, man, I tell you,
I ain't sure about a lot of things.
I came because I wanted him to know that no matter how bad he'd blown it,
I still had some feeling left.
Man, my old man split when I was still sucking on a nipple.
Last I heard, he was shacked up with some bimbo in Puerto Rico.
You know, Danny, maybe there were circumstances, you know?
Oh, right, Marcus.
It's all a bad movie, like the 'Nam, and it'll all be over when the lights come up.
Maybe you ought to talk more, find out where he's coming from.
After what he did to my mother,
I'd rather try and sandpaper a bobcat's butt in a phone booth.
[♪♪♪]
Hey, can you wait, man?
Sure.
Sure.
Servicemen, huh?
Yeah.
How did you know?
Shoes and socks.
Black and black.
Dead giveaway.
No matter how duded up you get.
Don't let them rip you off in there, huh?
All right, Joe.
Hey, baby.
Don't you like soldiers?
There's an art to this, you know.
Yeah.
I guess so.
What you got on your mind, sugar?
I don't know.
Something that suits my personality.
That would be an extinguished light bulb, ma'am.
"Mother" is a real popular item.
Oh, come on, something with a little more style.
Yeah, yeah.
He needs something like,
"Live fast, die young, and try and leave a pretty corpse."
All right, how about "Born to kill"?
What are you, some kind of Hell's Angel or something?
I'm a soldier.
That figures.
Cash.
No credit.
You want extras, it's gonna cost you.
Extras?
I also do windows, honey.
Leonarda Da Vinci, Joe.
Check it out.
Leonarda's the friendly type.
Man, if she was any friendlier, we could have gotten arrested.
Where to, fellas?
Wine, women, and song, Joe.
Wine, women, and song.
Hey, like Sinatra says,
"Whatever gets you through the night."
You want to check out my tattoo?
[♪♪♪]
You know, my grandmama raised me.
The main thing she taught me?
Ain't nothing positive come out of a negative thought.
That's right.
You know, you've got to go back, Danny.
You've got to get yourself straight with him, man.
What's gonna make this time different than the last six or seven disappointments?
He's blood, man.
You've got to respect that.
You know, one thing's sure.
These people aren't worried about no war.
You think they give a damn that we're out there dying and fighting in some jungle hellhole?
They ain't got time to worry about stuff like people dying.
They're too busy worried about getting an even tan or whether they've got the latest dance steps down.
You know, upstairs in the hospital, they got this whole ward of guys from 'Nam.
I talked to a couple of those guys, and let me tell you, they're pretty messed up.
Well, look, man, the way I figure, if there's a bullet out there with my name on it, then I'd just as soon have my family collect my GI insurance.
I'm not gonna go home with any vital parts missing.
Hey, man, check it out.
There's those chicks from the hotel.
Man, forget that.
Hey, come on, man, let's go talk to 'em.
Hey, what the hell, Ru.
Wine, women, and song.
How y'all doing?
How you doing, ladies?
Excuse me.
We're the soldiers you saw at the hotel today, remember?
Yeah, some of Uncle Sam's finest.
TAYLOR:
That's right.
This is Danny Percell, marksman par excellence.
Mi amigo, Alberto Ruiz, and I'm Marcus Taylor.
We're at your service.
Damn straight, glad to meet you.
Hello.
Oh, God.
Looks like an angel, speaks like an angel.
Yeah, but this ain't the Pearly Gates.
Yeah, well, heaven on earth's good enough for me.
Excuse me, ladies.
How you doing?
You got a name?
Leslie.
Leslie always has had a thing for men in uniform, right, Leslie?
Yeah, well, is that right, Leslie?
Well, with all due modesty,
John Wayne happens to be a wimp compared to some of my war exploits.
Is it me, or is it getting deep in here?
Hey, now, come on, Ru.
We can't deny the man his truth.
Girls, I have to tell you,
Marcus Taylor is a pure fighting machine.
I, for one, am proud to walk in the man's shadow.
Well, maybe it's a stroke of luck that I met you guys.
See, we're here on vacation from Stanford University, and, uh...
I'm supposed to be working on my thesis.
Thesis?
What's the subject?
Vietnam.
War or country?
See, we happen to be certified experts on both.
It's about American imperialism,
America fighting an immoral war, and our soldiers killing innocent men, women, and children.
Look, lady,
I don't know what you're trying to prove.
I mean, how does it make you feel to take an innocent human life?
How do you feel when you have the blood of babies on your hands?
Listen, you little--
No, Ru!
Let the lady finish what she started.
I think I'm finished.
Oh, no, you haven't finished, because I haven't answered your question.
Let me go.
When I pull that trigger, I feel a rush.
The power that I greased a gook, and the pain I had to do it.
You pull an M-16 on somebody, lady, you just do 'em... and if it's a woman or a kid, you have nightmares, but you do it, because you know if you don't kill them, they're gonna kill you.
Please.
It's war, lady.
We didn't ask to be included.
But you know what hurts the most is that we might die for our country in some godforsaken rice paddy, and people like you calling us baby killers.
Let go.
Take your hands off her.
You know, you people are such smartasses, you could probably sit on ice cream and tell what flavor it is.
TAYLOR:
Come on, group!
Hit it, Ru!
Go, go, go!
I got it.
Okay.
I need to know something, Marcus.
I need to know something too,
Danny.
I need to know what God's master plan for me is.
Am I going to be a movie star, or rock 'n' roll idol, or is my grandmother gonna be mad when I decide to leave Motown and move to Hollywood in a long, pink Cadillac.
Hey, Joe.
Yeah.
I need to know how could play it so cool when that girl was hassling you?
You know how many times
I've been called "nigger"?
Man, I wanted to punch her lights out, but once you hear
"spic" and "greaseball" enough,
"baby killer"
only raises your temperature a little bit.
You know what else I want to know?
I want to know what all this stuff is I'm hearing about peace marches and protests while we're laying our lives on the line.
Like that guy at the hotel throwing "peace" in our face?
Who the hell does he think he is?
Well, maybe the guy, he just wants peace.
Most people take peace over war.
TAYLOR:
Hold it, hold it.
You're Japanese, Joe, right?
Yeah.
I mean, we're over there greasing Orientals.
How does that make you feel about us?
Interesting question.
I'm Japanese, but I lived in L.A.
till the Second World War broke out.
You moved then?
Well, my family was moved to an internment camp.
You know, surrounded by barbed wire.
My brother and me, we later served with the 4-4-deuce regimental combat team in Italy and France.
Yeah, my brother, he was killed by a grenade just six days before he was supposed to ship back.
Your brother dies fighting for America while your family's in a prison camp?
When you reach my age, boys, you learn there are no clear answers about war.
We're Japanese- Americans.
Nisei, huh?
We serve proudly.
I'm proud too, Joe.
Damn proud.
I hate killing, but I love this country, so I'm gonna fight to preserve what all the wars before this one were fought for... but it bothers me what that girl said about us...
You mean, "Baby killer"?
because it's true, Joe... and the truth hurts... bad.
It's war, Danny.
Damn it, let it go.
I can't.
I just can't.
It don't mean nothing, Danny, man.
Look, what does is that you're a hell of a soldier, man.
I mean, this side of sarge, you're the best in the platoon.
He's right.
Maybe even better than sarge.
Marcus, better than sarge?
You mean that?
Yeah.
Better than sarge?
No offense, Percell, but you ain't better than sarge.
I didn't say, "Better than sarge."
I said, "Maybe better that sarge."
Are you crazy, man?
What you been smoking?
Hey, hey, hey.
You don't have to get hostile, man.
All right, tell me how he could be better than sarge.
Okay, okay, okay.
So big deal.
I lied.
No offense, Danny, but, uh... now that I think about it, you ain't even as good as Johnson.

Something to drink, sir?
Yes.

Yes, sir.
Well, well.
How you feeling, Big Spender?
Like I was led astray.
Oh, yeah, we dragged you kicking and screaming.
Hey, I've been thinking about what you said about family and blood.
I think I'm gonna go to the hospital and talk to my father.
Do you want us to tag along, Danny?
No.
No, I wouldn't want you to lose your rhythm.
Thanks.
Somebody told me once that if you marry the Army, you'll wake up one morning realizing you married a whore.
Now, that's no disrespect to the Army.
It just means it can suck you dry if you're not careful.
Understand?
Yeah, I'm trying to.
When I re-upped for my second tour, it killed whatever was left between your mother and me.
Oh, we made pretenses.
It went back and forth, but finally you have to decide that life goes on.
Well, how come she never tried to explain it?
What's to explain?
We're still friends, we own the horses together... and I'd like to think
I'm not as big a bastard as you think I am.
Hey, you know what I'm talking about.
I mean, when you get out of here and you get back home, it might be time to slow down.
Quit the circuit and trying to out-party the whole state of Montana.
I don't know, bud.
I'll take that under consideration if you'll make me a promise.
Like what?
That you'll come home safe.
Hey, you know, I figure, if you're a soldier and there's a war, the only one place for you to be and that's where the fighting is.
Yeah,
I know there's no guarantees.
I just want you to watch your butt.
War forces a man to reach inside himself and pull out a part of himself he didn't even know was there.
Well, you ain't looking at no hero, that's for sure.
Daniel... if you don't want to come home for me, then come home for your mother.
Do your tour, do your duty, and then come home.
Where's Howard, man?
Where is he?
His mother's coming in today, man.
His mother, man!
Where is he?
Oh, God.
He did it to himself, didn't he?
He did it himself, didn't he?
He pulled out his IVs.
We didn't catch it till it was too late.
HOSPITAL PA:
Dr. Martinelli, CCU, please.
Spent the night talking with him.
You know, that never happened before.
I mean, the man was never around long enough for that to happen.
Did you try the eggs?
You've got to try the eggs, man.
No thanks, bro.
You queer or something for eggs, Ru?
We spend the night with these two dollies, and all he keeps talking about all night is eggs.
I was hungry.
Eggs are very romantic, Ru, if you're a chicken.
Man, I spent six months without eating a real egg.
When do you think I'll eat another one, huh?
You know, I talked to him about... when I get back to the real world, maybe he and I are gonna get a breeding farm together.
You mean, like, real, live horses?
Sure.
Start small.
Maybe after a while, give the big boys a run for their money.
You know about horses?
Marcus, I know about horses like you think you know about women.
You're in trouble.
Horses eat, Percell.
They eat and they eat and they eat, and then when they finish eating, you got to go in there and rake up what they just ate.
The point is, maybe it's not too late for me and him to get it together.
Gives me something to look forward to.
I want some more eggs.
Do you guys want some more eggs?
Now, these ladies said we were gonna meet us at the beach and we told them you were gonna be with us.
Yeah, well,
I think I'm gonna spend some more time with dad.
All of them will wait, except the one I had for you, the one that looked like Natalie Wood.
I just want you to be thinking about that, okay?
Oh, I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
Come on!
Come on!
Hey, what's going on?
You guys work in the deaf ward?
Security's in 503, right?
I hope they're up there.
Security.
Ward K.
Look out.
Security.
Ward K. Stat.
Come on.
Repeat.
Security.
Ward K. Stat.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Hey, what's going on?
Where's the keys?
Give me the keys!
Better call the MPs.
Hold on, let us talk to him.
He's got a gun.
We've seen guns before.
Where's the drugs?
I want my medication.
Give the cripple his medication!
Unlock the door, brother.
We just want to talk.
You unlock it, sport.
Go ahead, unlock it.
Hey, look.
Why don't you let that guy in there go, man?
You don't need a hostage.
No hagas esto, hermano.
No te metas!
TAYLOR:
Yo, let him go, man.
You don't want to hurt anybody.
You know how many people I've killed?
How much do you think they hurt?
Go on.
Get out of here.
Que tu quieres?
What do you want with me?
Nothing, man.
We're just grunts, that's all.
On RR.
Slumming?
Hey.
Remember me?
I'm the guy you talked to about Harold.
Oh, yeah.
Harold.
Sweet Harold.
What kind of chance did he have?
Ain't no way they could put him back together.
Look at the rest of those guys out there.
Who's gonna give them back their lives?
Who's gonna give me back my life?
We just don't want anybody to get hurt any more than they've already been.
Maybe we could talk to your doctor.
Yeah, sure.
My doctor.
What's he gonna do?
Give me a fresh plastic bag for my urine when the one I got's filled?
He gonna be able to explain to me why I can never walk again?
Or make love to a woman again, ever?
Ever in my life?
You hear me, man?
You hear what I'm telling you?
I hear you, man.
I want to come in there and get that gun.
I don't want you to do that.
Don't come in here, man.
All I want to know is why... was I sent where I was sent.
Why was I sent to Vietnam?
Why was I killing people and why were they trying to kill me?
Hey, man.
Hey.
That's what we all want to know.
Yeah, well, I got some advice for you grunts.
Desert.
Go AWOL.
Don't let them send you back.
You've got your chance, so why not take it?
Don't end up like me.
I hear you.
I hear you, man, but listen.
Listen.
Harold wouldn't want you getting upset like this, now, would he?
He wouldn't want this to be happening.
Harold's dead, man!
Dead!
He pulled the plug himself.
Suicide!
Think about your family, man.
You've got to think about your family.
Your mom.
Your dad.
What's more important than your family?
Now, listen to me.
I want to come to you and take that gun.
Oh, but please don't shoot me, man, because, hey, if I got to buy it,
I want to buy it in the bush, doing a John Wayne, taking about a half a dozen gooks with me, but not here, not by a brother.
Please.
Don't...
Don't do it, brother.
Don't do it.
Please.
Listen to me.
You don't want to do that.
Let me take the gun.
Please.
Let me take it.
Let go, please.
It's okay, man.
It's okay.
All right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You're all right, man.
You're all right.
We're with you.
We're with you.
Join the Army.
Travel to exotic, distant lands.
Meet exciting, unusual people... and then kill them.
Before they kill you.
You know, I've been thinking about what that dude said.
About not going back?
Going AWOL?
Yeah.
Our buddies are dying in some stinking mudhole, and we take off?
I wouldn't want them to do that to me.
I sure as hell ain't gonna do that to them.
MAN:
Incoming!
[MORTAR FALLING]
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
[MACHINE GUN FIRE]
Mayday!
Mayday!
We're going down!
We're caught in a crossfire!
Medic!
Medic!
[♪♪♪]
Put that away.
Well done.
Not as good as last time, but good.
Colleen ...
- Don't forget, those of you who haven't completed your tally charts.
Moron.
Quiet!
- Anna Madden, out!
- But it wasn't me.
- Out!
- Sharon took my exercise book.
- Liar!
- Out now or you're on detention.
- But it was Sharon.
- Out!
No.
- Right, I'll see you after school.
And wait where I can see you.
Nigel, did I tell you to stand up?
No, so get back in your seat.
Now, we all know how many degress there are in a circle, don't we Nigel.
Quit!
The next person to laugh joins her.
Right, we're starting something new today.
Another way of showing basic statistics.
Pie charts.
Now a pie chart is just another way of showing information.
Take for example the information we took last week.
Now what was the most common number of letters in all your surnames?
Seven.
About half of you have seven letters in your surnames.
So ... what portion of the pie do those people have?
Half.
180-degree slice of the pie.
Now I'm going to make up a different pie chart with a different set of information.
How we spend our day.
I'll do an example for you based on my average weekday then I want you to make up a pie chart based on your average Saturday.
First, I write down my information.
What are the things I do?
Getting dressed and undressed.
Eating.
Travelling.
School.
Meeting friends.
What?
- I feel dizzy.
- She's lying!
- I want to go home.
- She's lying, Miss!
I'm not!
-Well you don't sound ill to me.
If you disturb us again you're going straight to Mr. Murphy.
Understand?
But it's my birthday.
Well you should have thought of that before.
Quiet.
And you can wipe that look off your face, Sharon Davis.
Where were we?
Sleeping.
Right.
I spend one hour dressing and undressing.
About two and a half hours eating.
About 8 hours at school.
She passed out.
- Is she gonna die?
- Trisham, go get matron.
Thanks.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
- Terrible, mum.
- That bad, eh?
Worse.
- Oh, but I'm sure it's nothing serious.
- I wish they hadn't called you.
- I could have gone home by myself.
- Don't worry.
Things were so busy at work that it was really nice to get out of there.
Listen, this'll cheer you up.
It came after you left.
Guess who it's from?
- Dad.
- Yeah.
Happy 11th birthday.
Lots of love, Dad.
Well, that's not all.
There's something very special fixed up for you.
- What?
- No, it's a surprise.
Riding lessons?
Yeah, some surprise.
Where's Mogadishu?
-I think it's a port on the east coast of Africa.
Well they spelled my name wrong.
-Did they?
Oh ... it's just a mistake.
- Maybe I could send a reply.
- That's a nice idea.
- I wish dad was here.
- So do I.
- When's he coming back?
- Soon.
How are you feeling now?
- No worse.
When is the riding lesson?
- It was meant to be after school today.
Meant to be?
Let's see what Dr. Nicols says first.
Do we have to?
I'm sure if I just lay down in front of the telly I'll be OK.
Doctor first.
No arguing, okay?
Stop!
Stop it!
- I was pretending.
- Pretending?
Sharon Davis stole my book.
Then I pushed her off the chair and Miss Vanstone put me on detention.
I can't be on detention on my birthday, can I?
So I faked it.
You faked it?
So you're not ill?
- Where are we going?
- Back.
- I can't go back.
- Oh, you're going back.
- I'll look stupid.
- Well you do already.
Stupid cow.
Just because it's your birthday don't think you can talk to me like that.
You should be pleased there's nothing wrong with me.
You're telling too many lies, Anna, and it is going to stop.
- What about my riding lesson?
- Oh, don't ask.
We'll see.
- What does that mean?
- It means we'll see.
I hate you.
Karen.
Come here.
- I was wondering where you got to.
- Shh ...
Got the afternoon off.
I'm having a really miserable birthday.
- You been using the sunlamp again?
- No, my skin just tans very fast ... naturally.
I don't get brown;
I get sunstroke.
Last year I fell asleep in a deck chair on my dad's oil rig, and when I woke up I was burnt to a frazzle.
- Why's your mum so angry with you?
- 'Cause she's a cow.
What was Gary's party like then?
Lots of snogging.
Not much else I can remember, really.
- You had a nice time then?
- I suppose you could call it that.
First I was upstairs with Nigel, then on the sofa with Ronnie ... then Vaughn Hancock, pissed out of his head, got me on the thick pile.
You're lucky you haven't started that yet.
What's snogging like then?
Well, like kissing a vacuum cleaner.
This looks a real skill place to play hide-and-seek.
- I'm too old for that kind of thing.
- Bet you 50p you can't find me.
- A quid.
- You're on.
Close your eyes, count to 100, and don't peek.
1, 2, 3, 4 ... 86, 87, 88 ...
99, 100.
I'm coming!
Is anybody there?
Karen!
It's her.
Anna.
Don't ever do that to me again.
Never!
What has got into you?
Mum, I don't feel very well.
Now open wide.
My throat hurts ...
like I've swallowed dust.
Gritty ... and it aches, but that's all.
You sure that's all?
No fainting fits?
No dizziness?
And this ache, is it just in your throat?
You've obviously had quite an eventful birthday.
- I suppose you could call it that.
- Sorry to drag you out like this ... but I was worried.
I don't blame you.
Look, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
She should have a couple of days rest.
What I don't understand is what happened in the tunnel?
Anna.
What happened in the tunnel?
Fell asleep and lost track of time.
You know....
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I'll have that throat swab analyzed.
And you're obviously running quite a temperature.
- And I think a day or two in bed ...
- When it goes down can I go riding?
- You must rest for a couple of days.
- I'm not staying in bed.
Don't.
Well, think of it this way:
if you rest now you'll get better sooner.
You rush around, who knows how long it might take.
How long exactly do I have to stay in bed?
I'll come and see you again at the end of the week.
- The end of the week?
- Count yourself lucky.
I've got a patient a little bit older than you whose been in bed for a year.
I'd rather die than that.
You and he would get on well.
No we wouldn't:
I hate boys.
- I'll see you on Friday then.
- Goodnight Sarah
Here Sarah, I'll show you out.
Is there someone who can come and look after Anna whilst you're at work?
No.
- I'll have to take some time off.
- You okay?
Yeah.
I could do with a break, that's all.
Tired?
Yeah.
It's always difficult when John's away, and I just ...
I don't know....
Too sad.
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?
Can I come in?
I can't hear you.
- I said go away.
- No, you let me in, then I'll go away.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
'Cause there aren't any stairs.
- How did you get up there then?
- I don't know.
I'm just here.
Can't you tell someone else to let me in?
-There isn't anyone else.
Look, just stop mucking around and let me in.
Go away, don't you understand, it's dangerous around here, dangerous.
It's real.
There are stairs.
- You were wrong about the stairs.
- Must have come since.
Since I drew them.
You shouldn't be here.
I knew I should've made you more cheerful.
I drew you, this house, the stairs, everything.
Come and have a look, come on.
I can't walk.
Of course, I didn't draw you any legs.
I'm not a drawing!
I'm sorry, I just drew someone at the window, that's all.
It's alright.
My name's Mark, what's yours?
Mark!
Mum?
And one, and two, and three...
- Mum?
- What?
- Mum?
- Go away please.
- What's wrong mum?
Nothing, I just don't want you ruining this print.
- Feeling better?
- No, worse.
What photo are you doing?
The one you took on the beach last summer.
I'm having dreams mum, but they're real, I know they are.
Dreams can't be real sweetie.
It's dad!
They might frighten you but they can never hurt you.
- How do you know?
- Because if they could they wouldn't be dreams.
- No, leave it, I like the clouds dark.
- Alright, darling.
Oh that's too much.
Come on, we're gonna get you to bed.
- No, i'll be alright if I stay awake.
- No, come on, come on right now.
On the other side of the hill is the sea.
It shines out for miles and miles and everyone can see it.
It looks like glandular fever.
I lied to you about the fainting, it's happened several times.
I guessed you weren't telling the truth.
That's all though, you didn't need to come.
- I'm getting much better.
- Your mother was right to call me.
- Is it bad?
- Well, it'll knock you out for a few weeks.
Your pulse is right up.
So are these glands.
- What have you been upto in here?
- Nothing.
- When did you last faint.
- After I saw you, yesterday.
I see.
Sarah?
- You know this boy you see?
- Yes.
When's he going to be able to get up?
Well, he can get up, he just doesn't want to most of the time, that's all.
He's getting better though?
You're really interested in my other patients Anna?
- Doesn't he want to get better?
- Well of course he does.
Then why doesn't he get out of bed?
As long as he gets enough books to read he's content to stay in bed.
That's terrible, I can't stand staying in bed.
If you told me I could get up tomorrow i'd be up.
Well it isn't just a question of getting up, it's just that...
Exercise is too much bother and pain for Mark.
- Mark, can't walk?
- No.
What wrong Anna?
We're just opposites me and him, aren't we?
He's got to do exercise and doesn't want to... and i've got to stay in bed and I don't want to.
It's a pity you can't mix us up a bit.
Well I dare say you two are each better off as you are.
I'll have a word with Kate on my way out.
Bye Anna.
Now he'll walk.
Mark!
Mark!
Mark?
Oh, no cones.
Hi.
Whoever left this should've left some instructions.
It seems to be based on the Apple design, it's a bit crude.
I'll fix that tomorrow.
I suppose you'll tell me you drew it, that would explain why it's so mental.
You've been moving things around.
My name's Anna.
- I drew you walking but it went wrong.
- I don't undertstand you.
- You like reading don't you?
- Yeah.
- Then you are Mark?
- Well i'm not a drawing, I know that.
I've got the same doctor as you, Dr Nichols.
Not me.
- I mean... when you're not here.
- Look, i'm always here.
- They left me here.
- Who left you here?
It's great, isn't it?
Do you want some fruit?
It's really good for you.
Ok.
Behind you!
Very funny.
Very funny, I could've broken my leg, you're so stupid.
There was this boy... about my age... he had a bike, a blue one... it was in perfect nick.
Although he loved this bike, he couldn't ride it.
He'd just watch it every day and having it there made all the difference.
But one day he'd ride it and that was all that ever mattered to him.
Why are you here Mark?
I did something wrong, I expect that's why you're here too.
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- Oh I bet!
But I haven't done anything wrong.
Maybe all this stuff's here for you and you're to stay here like me.
No chance, this is a dream.
That's what I thought.
Do you think whoever brought you here will come back again?
I hope not.
If my dad was here he could carry you... and you could run away with us, then you'd be safe.
And you wouldn't be afraid any more.
He looks like a madman.
Hello darling.
- What's that?
- A radio.
- It doesn't look like a radio, it's too big.
- It's a radio.
Who's that?
That's dad, that's good.
I think he looks drunk, I hate it when he's drunk.
He stopped drinking years ago.
He was drunk when I took that picture.
- Why don't you have your soup.
- He was, wasn't he?
Let me see.
Well, a bit, maybe.
You could rub it out and try again.
- I can't.
- It's almost right, it's just...
His head's a bit too big and he looks sort of angry.
What is it?
Why don't you go back to work, I don't like you hanging around here.
- I'll be alright.
- Listen, it's good, it's really good.
- It's total rubbish!
- It's only a drawing Anna, come on.
That's right, it's only a drawing.
I think it's good, I really do.
It's just that i'm having those dreams again... and i'm frightened dad's going to come into those dreams looking like that.
Listen, if dad came into your dreams that would be nice.
And no drawing is going to make any difference.
- Have I done anything wrong?
- Do you ever do anything right?
I must've done something really bad.
It's nothing you've done, that's silly, don't think that.
- Then why don't you believe me?
- Believe what?
That my dreams are frightening me.
- I do believe you.
- No you don't.
Listen...
I know it's hard for you with dad away all the time but...
It's hard for me too, we've got to try to get on better.
- Will you promise me something?
- What?
You've got to be honest with me about when you pass out and when you... see things that maybe I don't see, you understand?
It's really important Anna, you have to promise.
I always tell you the truth.
A nice hot bath and then to bed.
Mum!
Mum!
- I don't feel well.
- I know, I know, you try and get some sleep, ok?
- My head hurts.
- I know but I have to dry your hair.
There, just a bit more.
Ok.
- Will you set my alarm for me?
- Why, are you going somewhere special tomorrow?
- Set it for 7.
- Ok.
I'll just get your teddy.
Stay with me until I get to sleep, I don't wanna be on my own.
Sure.
I'll just be a second, I just have to get something from my room.
No dreams.
- That was quick.
- I'm late.
Is something the matter?
I'm very busy this morning, I should be at the hospital.
Well perhaps I should've got worse yesterday.
- Is anything wrong?
- No.
- You're miserable today.
- Well even doctors get miserable sometimes Anna.
- Is it something I did?
- Don't think so.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I've given you some mild sleeping pills... keep a very close eye on her temperature... and let me know immediately if she seems delirious.
It's not very likely, she seems stable now.
Sarah, are you sure you're alright, you look worried.
It's just a young boy I thought was ok had a relapse yesterday.
What's wrong with him?
He has muscular dystrophy, he's got a chest infection.
- Oh no.
- It's dangerous.
Anna, what are you doing?
Mum, last night you cleared up my bedroom...
I threw something away, where's the rubbish?
I've got to find it.
I leave you alone for 5 minutes and you work yourself up into a frenzy.
But I threw something away and i've got to find it.
- What is it.
- A drawing.
- A drawing?
Can't you do another one?
- No!
Alright, i'll go and look, but only if you promise to take 2 of these pills.
Yeah!
- Yes, yes, just find it.
- Ok, ok, here, stop it, stop, here, Anna!
God, well if it's not there there's nothing I can do, ok?
- No that's not ok.
- Well, i'll find it alright.
Anna!
Wait!
Don't!
Anna!
Anna!
Come back!
Anna!
Wait!
Anna!
Wait!
Come on love, out of the way.
No, I have to find something, I threw it away by mistake.
- To bed now, come on!
- No!
You're going to be sick, really sick unless you calm down.
You've gotta help me find it mum, please.
Can you help?
- What type of bag was it?
Black!
Ok boys, we're looking for a black bag!
Please, let me check them.
Open them mum, open them.
- You missed one.
- I'm doing my best.
It could be any of these.
- Look, you've lost the drawing Anna, just accept it.
- No!
- That's your lot.
- You didn't check that one.
If we checked every one we'd be here all day.
It's no good Anna, stop it now.
There!
You're going to be alright now darling, you must sleep.
Mark?
Mark?
Fooled you!
Your face.
Sorry Anna.
- How you feeling?
- Fine.
You did all this then, eh?
I don't understand you.
Mark, do you remember anything about the real world?
But this is the real world.
I suppose so.
When i'm not here I know where I am... and you're there too.
- What's wrong with me?
- You're in hospital.
I wish you weren't, sorry.
Well you're right about one thing...
I am ill.
I'm tired, like i've just run a marathon but all the time.
And the big joke is I have to crawl to move from this lump of wood.
- That must be really uncomfortable.
- And cold.
Instead of making a mess out of this place... why don't you help me?
I think I should wake up now.
- I can't wake up.
- I told you so.
- They've come for us.
- Who?
- It's dad!
- No, don't let him in.
- Rubbish, i'll go and fetch him.
- No!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, come in, it's getting dark.
- Anna, is that you?
- Yes.
I'm blind!
No locks.
Anna, he's moving, he's got a hammer.
- Anna!
- Go away.
Anna.
Are you ok?
Let me in Anna.
- Behind the hills is a sea, we have to go there.
- You go.
- Listen, we can ride the bike.
- How can I ride a bike, be realistic.
You ride and i'll push.
- You're mad.
- Anna!
Please Mark, you have to try.
Anna, i'm not going away so you might aswell let me in.
Let me in Anna!
Open this door now!
- You'll never get me up on this.
- Try.
Anna.
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't.
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't leave you.
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.
There.
You've had a really bad fever darling but I think this is the worst of it.
When you're better we'll go to the seaside.
You like the sea.
We'll go there, all 3 of us, and we'll have a big, long rest, ok.
To the sea, to the sea, to the beautiful sea.
Let me see, let me see it.
You're temperature's going down, it's normal, you're getting better.
- Don't.
- What.
- Who are you?
- Anna?
I don't talk to strangers, go away.
- Go away.
- It's mummy, you're alright now.
Go away!
Anna!
What are you doing?
Darling?
Anna!
Look at me, look at me!
Anna, please, don't!
Anna, please, don't!
Anna!
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
He must've taken him.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
Anna?
Anna?
You're going to be alright.
Just stay where you are.
Daddy's here.
Anna!
Alright... if you want to play games...
One, two, three... four, five, six... seven, eight, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...
It's you he's after not me, you should've never come back.
I thought that he'd taken you.
Listen. it won't take him long to find us...
You've gotta wake up and change your stupid drawing, get rid of him.
I've tried.
No, rip him out of the paper, it's the only way.
- I drew a lighthouse, we can go there then we'll be safe.
- Ok.
Look, just wake up, we're not going to get anywhere with him around.
I can't.
- Wake up!
- I can't.
Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three...
Thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six...
I've got an idea.
Lie down like you're in bed... do it!
Reach out to where the drawing is.
Pick up the drawing Anna.
Careful!
- Dad's on the left, by the rocks.
- Put your finger on him.
Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine...
Now rip him out!
Ninety-nine, one hundred.
I'm coming.
Run Anna, leave me.
Anna!
Mark, Mark!
Mark!
Get off me!
Who are you?
- What is your name?
- Please, dad, please.
Do you know me?
Do you recognise me?
The sea.
Anna?
- Anna.
- It's alright love, it's just the tube.
There's a brave girl.
You'll be alright, you'll be alright.
Anna?
It hurts when I breathe.
That's just your ribs, they're a bit bruised.
The ambulance man had to give you a heart massage.
- He saved your life.
- I know but it still hurts.
You'll be out of here in a few days.
I've been here long enough.
How's Mark?
- How's Mark?
- He's ok.
Don't lie to me.
We sent him home, he'll be more comfortable there.
He's dying isn't he?
- They've stopped.
- What's stopped.
My dreams.
If I tell you something, will you keep it a secret?
- I know Mark, I know him from my dreams.
- Anna...
I drew a house on paper, Mark's there too.
It was me who made Mark ill and me who helped him get better again.
Then we had to escape and we did but now I can't even dream.
You have to believe me.
When you're ill the mind plays funny tricks.
It's not a trick...
Mark's eyes are blue...
His left leg is stronger than his right...
He's got a bicycle, a blue one, he just looks at it.
- How do you know all this?
- It's true isn't it?
You have to get me my pencils and drawings, you have to.
- But...
- Just do it!
And as soon as you're better...
I'm going to take us all down to Devon for a little holiday.
Hey, are you listening to me?
Look at me darling.
That's better, I was beginning to think I was invisible.
You don't have to be invisible to disappear, dad.
Anna, you said you wanted to go to the seaside, no?
Sounds wonderful mum.
Hey and don't forget your riding lessons.
I've taken time off, we can go together if you like.
And then you'll go away again.
I don't know what you want these for but here they are.
She shouldn't have told you, I told Sarah to keep it a secret.
- Can I see?
- No.
I wouldn't want to live if he died.
Now if there's anything we need we'll be alright.
Mark, Mark.
Anna.
Wait there.
How's that then eh?
I thought you weren't ever coming back.
Come on, there's lots to show you...
You've really kitted out the place good this time.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Nothing, just pleased to see you.
Come on, let's walk along the cliffs.
Here, I want to show you something.
- Can you do rollovers?
- Yeah.
You haven't done them properly until you've done them here, my way.
What do you mean "your way"?
Sit in front of me.
Keep your head well in and imagine you're half of a wheel.
Now pull me.
Again!
How am I getting on in your world?
You're recovering but not as fast as here.
- So i'm different here?
- Don't know.
I don't care what happens to me there, as long as I can be here with you.
You see, your world doesn't matter any more, we can live here.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Me neither.
Is this snogging?
I've walked as far as I can along these cliffs but there's no way down.
- We should draw a ladder then.
- There's not one long enough...
And even if there was I wouldn't go down there, would you?
I know i'm getting better but that's just stupidity.
- You suggest something then?
- Helicopter?
- I don't think I can draw that.
- I can.
I brought it with me this time.
You draw the helicopter.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Do you think it'll work for me?
- Don't know.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to draw.
Wait.
You can't go yet.
Well you wait down here and keep a look out for it.
I can see better from up there.
To be honest i'd rather draw by myself, I don't like people watching me.
- And I never saw you draw did I?
- I suppose not.
- You wait down here then.
- Ok.
Don't go without me.
Please don't go without me.
I've got some good news...
They've given me a job at head office so I don't have to go away anymore.
That's good isn't it?
We can all be together like a proper family.
Things aren't the same between you and me since I got back, are they?
I missed you when I was away but now I feel as if i'm missing you even more.
I'm worried.
- I went to see your doctor.
- Why?
Mum said you were having bad dreams about me, is that true?
Do you want to see someone about the dreams?
- I don't have them anymore.
- Maybe because i'm back.
No, it's nothing to do with you.
What did Dr Nichols say?
She said you knew a patient of hers who died.
What's the matter?
Mark's dead.
Didn't you know?
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry...
I knew, it's just when I last saw him I sort of hoped he'd get better.
Was he a close friend?
- Dr Nichols didn't tell me the whole story.
- Obviously.
Mark would hate anybody being sorry.
Come on Anna.
Did you seen those boats there?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Madden.
Hello, is everything ok?
That's good.
After lunch we'll go for a walk down to the front.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Don't lose it.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
- What on earth for?
- Being so miserable.
Don't be stupid.
It was the illness, when I was ill I thought I saw funny things.
I want to go to the pier...
to get Karen some rock.
- Well we'll go after we've eaten.
- Good.
- Shall I open your curtains.
- Whatever you like.
Be careful you don't get sunstroke.
Mark, i'm back.
Mark.
Mark, let me in.
Mark.
Mark.
Mark, let me in.
Let me in.
I don't want to go without you but the helicopter's been hovering all day.
I think i'm meant to go.
Wait for me here, i'll come back for you, love Mark.
Mark, Mark, Mark!
Anna!
Move back from the edge, it's dangerous.
- I can't reach.
Move back from the edge Anna, it's dangerous.
- Anna, move away!
- I can't reach.
Mark, I can't reach, don't leave me.
- Anna, it's dangerous.
- I can't reach.
- Move away from the edge.
- Don't leave me.
- Bye Anna.
- No!
He's alright now mum, I know he is.
Put that away.
Well done.
Not as good as last time, but good.
Colleen...
Don't forget, those of you who haven't completed your tally charts
- Know all.
Moron.
Quiet!
- Anna Madden, out!
- But it wasn't me.
- Out!
- Sharon took my exercise book.
- Liar!
- Out now or you're on detention.
- But it was Sharon.
- Out!
No.
Right, I'll see you after school.
And wait where I can see you.
Nigel, did I tell you to stand up?
No, so get back in your seat.
Now, we all know how many degrees there are in a circle, don't we Nigel.
Quit!
The next person to laugh joins her.
Right, we're starting something new today.
Another way of showing basic statistics.
Pie charts.
Now a pie chart is just another way of showing information.
Take for example the information we took last week.
Now what was the most common number of letters in all your surnames?
Seven.
About half of you have seven letters in your surnames.
So... what portion of the pie do those people have?
Half.
180-degree slice of the pie.
Now I'm going to make up a different pie chart with a different set of information.
How we spend our day.
I'll do an example for you based on my average weekday then I want you to make up a pie chart based on your average Saturday.
First, I write down my information.
What are the things I do?
Getting dressed and undressed.
Eating.
Travelling.
School.
Meeting friends.
What?
- I feel dizzy.
- She's lying!
- I want to go home.
- She's lying, Miss!
- I'm not!
- Well you don't sound ill to me.
If you disturb us again you're going straight to Mr. Murphy.
Understand?
But it's my birthday.
Well you should have thought of that before.
Quiet.
And you can wipe that look off your face, Sharon Davis.
Where were we?
Sleeping.
Right.
I spend one hour dressing and undressing.
About two and a half hours eating.
About 8 hours at school.
She passed out.
- Is she gonna die?
- Trisham, go get matron.
Thanks.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
- Terrible, mum.
- That bad, eh?
Worse.
- Oh, but I'm sure it's nothing serious.
- I wish they hadn't called you.
- I could have gone home by myself.
- Don't worry.
Things were so busy at work that it was really nice to get out of there.
Listen, this'll cheer you up.
It came after you left.
Guess who it's from?
- Dad.
- Yeah.
Happy 11th birthday.
Lots of love, Dad.
Well, that's not all.
There's something very special fixed up for you.
- What?
- No, it's a surprise.
Riding lessons?
Yeah, some surprise.
Where's Mogadishu?
-I think it's a port on the east coast of Africa.
- Well they spelled my name wrong.
- Did they?
Oh... it's just a mistake.
- Maybe I could send a reply.
- That's a nice idea.
- I wish dad was here.
- So do I.
- When's he coming back?
- Soon.
How are you feeling now?
- No worse.
When is the riding lesson?
- It was meant to be after school today.
Meant to be?
Let's see what Dr. Nicole says first.
Do we have to?
I'm sure if I just lay down in front of the telly I'll be OK.
Doctor first.
No arguing, okay?
Stop!
Stop it!
- I was pretending.
- Pretending?
Sharon Davis stole my book.
Then I pushed her off the chair and Miss Vanstone put me on detention.
I can't be on detention on my birthday, can I?
So I faked it.
You faked it?
So you're not ill?
- Where are we going?
- Back.
- I can't go back.
- Oh, you're going back.
- I'll look stupid.
- Well you do already.
Stupid cow.
Just because it's your birthday don't think you can talk to me like that.
You should be pleased there's nothing wrong with me.
You're telling too many lies, Anna, and it is going to stop.
- What about my riding lesson?
- Oh, don't ask.
We'll see.
- What does that mean?
- It means we'll see.
I hate you.
Karen.
Come here.
- I was wondering where you got to.
- Shh...
Got the afternoon off.
I'm having a really miserable birthday.
- You been using the sunlamp again?
- No, my skin just tans very fast... naturally.
I don't get brown;
I get sunstroke.
Last year I fell asleep in a deck chair on my dad's oil rig, and when I woke up I was burnt to a frazzle.
- Why's your mum so angry with you?
- 'Cause she's a cow.
What was Gary's party like then?
Lots of snogging.
Not much else I can remember, really.
- You had a nice time then?
- I suppose you could call it that.
First I was upstairs with Nigel, then on the sofa with Ronnie... then Vaughn Hancock, pissed out of his head, got me on the thick pile.
You're lucky you haven't started that yet.
What's snogging like then?
Well, like kissing a vacuum cleaner.
This looks a real skill place to play hide-and-seek.
- I'm too old for that kind of thing.
- Bet you 50p you can't find me.
- A quid.
- You're on.
Close your eyes, count to 100, and don't peek.
1, 2, 3, 4... 86, 87, 88...
99, 100.
I'm coming!
Is anybody there?
Karen!
It's her.
Anna.
Don't ever do that to me again.
Never!
What has got into you?
Mum, I don't feel very well.
Now open wide.
My throat hurts...
like I've swallowed dust.
Gritty... and it aches, but that's all.
You sure that's all?
No fainting fits?
No dizziness?
And this ache, is it just in your throat?
You've obviously had quite an eventful birthday.
- I suppose you could call it that.
- Sorry to drag you out like this... but I was worried.
I don't blame you.
Look, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
She should have a couple of days rest.
What I don't understand is what happened in the tunnel?
Anna.
What happened in the tunnel?
Fell asleep and lost track of time.
You know...
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I'll have that throat swab analyzed.
And you're obviously running quite a temperature.
- And I think a day or two in bed...
- When it goes down can I go riding?
- You must rest for a couple of days.
- I'm not staying in bed.
Don't.
Well, think of it this way:
If you rest now you'll get better sooner.
You rush around, who knows how long it might take.
How long exactly do I have to stay in bed?
I'll come and see you again at the end of the week.
- The end of the week?
- Count yourself lucky.
I've got a patient a little bit older than you whose been in bed for a year.
I'd rather die than that.
You and he would get on well.
No we wouldn't:
I hate boys.
- I'll see you on Friday then.
- Goodnight Sarah
Here Sarah, I'll show you out.
Is there someone who can come and look after Anna whilst you're at work?
No.
- I'll have to take some time off.
- You okay?
Yeah.
I could do with a break, that's all.
Tired?
Yeah.
It's always difficult when John's away, and I just...
I don't know...
Too sad.
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?
Can I come in?
I can't hear you.
- I said go away.
- No, you let me in, then I'll go away.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
'Cause there aren't any stairs.
- How did you get up there then?
- I don't know.
I'm just here.
Can't you tell someone else to let me in?
-There isn't anyone else.
Look, just stop mucking around and let me in.
Go away, don't you understand, it's dangerous around here, dangerous.
It's real.
There are stairs.
- You were wrong about the stairs.
- Must have come since.
Since I drew them.
You shouldn't be here.
I knew I should've made you more cheerful.
I drew you, this house, the stairs, everything.
Come and have a look, come on.
I can't walk.
Of course, I didn't draw you any legs.
I'm not a drawing!
I'm sorry, I just drew someone at the window, that's all.
It's alright.
My name's Mark, what's yours?
Mark!
Mum?
And one, and two, and three...
- Mum?
- What?
- Mum?
- Go away please.
What's wrong mum?
Nothing, I just don't want you ruining this print.
- Feeling better?
- No, worse.
What photo are you doing?
The one you took on the beach last summer.
I'm having dreams mum, but they're real, I know they are.
Dreams can't be real sweetie.
It's dad!
They might frighten you but they can never hurt you.
How do you know?
Because if they could they wouldn't be dreams.
- No, leave it, I like the clouds dark.
- Alright, darling.
Oh that's too much.
Come on, we're gonna get you to bed.
- No, I'll be alright if I stay awake.
- No, come on, come on right now.
On the other side of the hill is the sea.
It shines out for miles and miles and everyone can see it.
It looks like glandular fever.
I lied to you about the fainting, it's happened several times.
I guessed you weren't telling the truth.
That's all though, you didn't need to come.
- I'm getting much better.
- Your mother was right to call me.
Is it bad?
Well, it'll knock you out for a few weeks.
Your pulse is right up.
So are these glands.
- What have you been up to in here?
- Nothing.
- When did you last faint.
- After I saw you, yesterday.
I see.
Sarah?
- You know this boy you see?
- Yes.
When's he going to be able to get up?
Well, he can get up, he just doesn't want to most of the time, that's all.
He's getting better though?
You're really interested in my other patients Anna?
- Doesn't he want to get better?
- Well of course he does.
Then why doesn't he get out of bed?
As long as he gets enough books to read he's content to stay in bed.
That's terrible, I can't stand staying in bed.
If you told me I could get up tomorrow I'd be up.
Well it isn't just a question of getting up, it's just that...
Exercise is too much bother and pain for Mark.
- Mark, can't walk?
- No.
What wrong Anna?
We're just opposites me and him, aren't we?
He's got to do exercise and doesn't want to... and I've got to stay in bed and I don't want to.
It's a pity you can't mix us up a bit.
Well I dare say you two are each better off as you are.
I'll have a word with Kate on my way out.
Bye Anna.
Now he'll walk.
Mark!
Mark!
Mark?
Oh, no cones.
Hi.
Whoever left this should've left some instructions.
It seems to be based on the Apple design, it's a bit crude.
I'll fix that tomorrow.
I suppose you'll tell me you drew it, that would explain why it's so mental.
You've been moving things around.
My name's Anna.
- I drew you walking but it went wrong.
- I don't understand you.
- You like reading don't you?
- Yeah.
- Then you are Mark?
- Well I'm not a drawing, I know that.
I've got the same doctor as you, Dr Nichols.
Not me.
- I mean... when you're not here.
- Look, I'm always here.
- They left me here.
- Who left you here?
It's great, isn't it?
Do you want some fruit?
It's really good for you.
Ok.
Behind you!
Very funny.
Very funny, I could've broken my leg, you're so stupid.
There was this boy... about my age... he had a bike, a blue one... it was in perfect nick.
Although he loved this bike, he couldn't ride it.
He'd just watch it every day and having it there made all the difference.
But one day he'd ride it and that was all that ever mattered to him.
Why are you here Mark?
I did something wrong, I expect that's why you're here too.
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- Oh I bet!
But I haven't done anything wrong.
Maybe all this stuff's here for you and you're to stay here like me.
No chance, this is a dream.
That's what I thought.
Do you think whoever brought you here will come back again?
I hope not.
If my dad was here he could carry you... and you could run away with us, then you'd be safe.
And you wouldn't be afraid any more.
He looks like a madman.
Hello darling.
- What's that?
- A radio.
It doesn't look like a radio, it's too big.
It's a radio.
Who's that?
That's dad, that's good.
I think he looks drunk, I hate it when he's drunk.
He stopped drinking years ago.
He was drunk when I took that picture.
- Why don't you have your soup.
- He was, wasn't he?
Let me see.
Well, a bit, maybe.
You could rub it out and try again.
- I can't.
- It's almost right, it's just...
His head's a bit too big and he looks sort of angry.
What is it?
Why don't you go back to work, I don't like you hanging around here.
- I'll be alright.
- Listen, it's good, it's really good.
- It's total rubbish!
- It's only a drawing Anna, come on.
That's right, it's only a drawing.
I think it's good, I really do.
It's just that I'm having those dreams again... and I'm frightened dad's going to come into those dreams looking like that.
Listen, if dad came into your dreams that would be nice.
And no drawing is going to make any difference.
- Have I done anything wrong?
- Do you ever do anything right?
I must've done something really bad.
It's nothing you've done, that's silly, don't think that.
- Then why don't you believe me?
- Believe what?
That my dreams are frightening me.
- I do believe you.
- No you don't.
Listen...
I know it's hard for you with dad away all the time but...
It's hard for me too, we've got to try to get on better.
- Will you promise me something?
- What?
You've got to be honest with me about when you pass out and when you... see things that maybe I don't see, you understand?
It's really important Anna, you have to promise.
I always tell you the truth.
A nice hot bath and then to bed.
Mum!
Mum!
I don't feel well.
I know, I know, you try and get some sleep, ok?
- My head hurts.
- I know but I have to dry your hair.
There, just a bit more.
Ok.
Will you set my alarm for me?
Why, are you going somewhere special tomorrow?
- Set it for 7.
- Ok.
I'll just get your teddy.
Stay with me until I get to sleep, I don't wanna be on my own.
Sure.
I'll just be a second, I just have to get something from my room.
No dreams.
- That was quick.
- I'm late.
Is something the matter?
I'm very busy this morning, I should be at the hospital.
Well perhaps I should've got worse yesterday.
- Is anything wrong?
- No.
You're miserable today.
Well even doctors get miserable sometimes Anna.
- Is it something I did?
- Don't think so.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I've given you some mild sleeping pills... keep a very close eye on her temperature... and let me know immediately if she seems delirious.
It's not very likely, she seems stable now.
Sarah, are you sure you're alright, you look worried.
It's just a young boy I thought was ok had a relapse yesterday.
What's wrong with him?
He has muscular dystrophy, he's got a chest infection.
- Oh no.
- It's dangerous.
Anna, what are you doing?
Mum, last night you cleared up my bedroom...
I threw something away, where's the rubbish?
I've got to find it.
I leave you alone for 5 minutes and you work yourself up into a frenzy.
But I threw something away and I've got to find it.
- What is it.
- A drawing.
- A drawing?
Can't you do another one?
- No!
Alright, I'll go and look, but only if you promise to take 2 of these pills.
Yeah!
Yes, yes, just find it.
Ok, ok, here, stop it, stop, here, Anna!
God, well if it's not there there's nothing I can do, ok?
- No that's not ok.
- Well, I'll find it alright.
Anna!
Wait!
Don't!
Anna!
Anna!
Come back!
Anna!
Wait!
Anna!
Wait!
Come on love, out of the way.
No, I have to find something, I threw it away by mistake.
- To bed now, come on!
- No!
You're going to be sick, really sick unless you calm down.
You've gotta help me find it mum, please.
- Can you help?
- What type of bag was it?
Black!
Ok boys, we're looking for a black bag!
Please, let me check them.
Open them mum, open them.
- You missed one.
- I'm doing my best.
It could be any of these.
Look, you've lost the drawing Anna, just accept it.
- No!
- That's your lot.
- You didn't check that one.
If we checked every one we'd be here all day.
It's no good Anna, stop it now.
There!
You're going to be alright now darling, you must sleep.
Mark?
Mark?
Fooled you!
Your face.
Sorry Anna.
- How you feeling?
- Fine.
You did all this then, eh?
I don't understand you.
Mark, do you remember anything about the real world?
But this is the real world.
I suppose so.
When I'm not here I know where I am... and you're there too.
- What's wrong with me?
- You're in hospital.
I wish you weren't, sorry.
Well you're right about one thing...
I am ill.
I'm tired, like I've just run a marathon but all the time.
And the big joke is I have to crawl to move from this lump of wood.
- That must be really uncomfortable.
- And cold.
Instead of making a mess out of this place... why don't you help me?
I think I should wake up now.
- I can't wake up.
- I told you so.
- They've come for us.
- Who?
- It's dad!
- No, don't let him in.
- Rubbish, I'll go and fetch him.
- No!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, come in, it's getting dark.
- Anna, is that you?
- Yes.
I'm blind!
No locks.
Anna, he's moving, he's got a hammer.
- Anna!
- Go away.
Anna.
Are you ok?
Let me in Anna.
Behind the hills is a sea, we have to go there.
You go.
- Listen, we can ride the bike.
- How can I ride a bike, be realistic.
You ride and I'll push.
- You're mad.
- Anna!
Please Mark, you have to try.
Anna, I'm not going away so you might as well let me in.
Let me in Anna!
Open this door now!
- You'll never get me up on this.
- Try.
Anna.
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't.
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't leave you.
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.
There.
You've had a really bad fever darling but I think this is the worst of it.
When you're better we'll go to the seaside.
You like the sea.
We'll go there, all 3 of us, and we'll have a big, long rest, ok.
To the sea, to the sea, to the beautiful sea.
Let me see, let me see it.
You're temperature's going down, it's normal, you're getting better.
- Don't.
- What.
- Who are you?
- Anna?
I don't talk to strangers, go away.
- Go away.
- It's mummy, you're alright now.
Go away!
Anna!
What are you doing?
Darling?
Anna!
Look at me, look at me!
Anna, please, don't!
Anna, please, don't!
Anna!
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
He must've taken him.
Mark?
Mark?
Mark?
Anna?
Anna?
You're going to be alright.
Just stay where you are.
Daddy's here.
Anna!
Alright... if you want to play games...
One, two, three... four, five, six... seven, eight, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...
It's you he's after not me, you should've never come back.
I thought that he'd taken you.
Listen.
It won't take him long to find us...
You've gotta wake up and change your stupid drawing, get rid of him.
I've tried.
No, rip him out of the paper, it's the only way.
I drew a lighthouse, we can go there then we'll be safe.
- Ok.
Look, just wake up, we're not going to get anywhere with him around.
I can't.
- Wake up!
- I can't.
Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three...
Thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six...
I've got an idea.
Lie down like you're in bed... do it!
Reach out to where the drawing is.
Pick up the drawing Anna.
Careful!
- Dad's on the left, by the rocks.
- Put your finger on him.
Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine...
Now rip him out!
Ninety-nine, one hundred.
I'm coming.
Run Anna, leave me.
Anna!
Mark, Mark!
Mark!
Get off me!
Who are you?
- What is your name?
- Please, dad, please.
Do you know me?
Do you recognise me?
The sea.
Anna?
- Anna.
- It's alright love, it's just the tube.
There's a brave girl.
You'll be alright, you'll be alright.
Anna?
It hurts when I breathe.
That's just your ribs, they're a bit bruised.
The ambulance man had to give you a heart massage.
- He saved your life.
- I know but it still hurts.
You'll be out of here in a few days.
I've been here long enough.
How's Mark?
- How's Mark?
- He's ok.
Don't lie to me.
We sent him home, he'll be more comfortable there.
He's dying isn't he?
- They've stopped.
- What's stopped.
My dreams.
If I tell you something, will you keep it a secret?
I know Mark, I know him from my dreams.
Anna...
I drew a house on paper, Mark's there too.
It was me who made Mark ill and me who helped him get better again.
Then we had to escape and we did but now I can't even dream.
You have to believe me.
When you're ill the mind plays funny tricks.
It's not a trick...
Mark's eyes are blue...
His left leg is stronger than his right...
He's got a bicycle, a blue one, he just looks at it.
- How do you know all this?
- It's true isn't it?
You have to get me my pencils and drawings, you have to.
- But...
- Just do it!
And as soon as you're better...
I'm going to take us all down to Devon for a little holiday.
Hey, are you listening to me?
Look at me darling.
That's better, I was beginning to think I was invisible.
You don't have to be invisible to disappear, dad.
Anna, you said you wanted to go to the seaside, no?
Sounds wonderful mum.
Hey and don't forget your riding lessons.
I've taken time off, we can go together if you like.
And then you'll go away again.
I don't know what you want these for but here they are.
She shouldn't have told you, I told Sarah to keep it a secret.
- Can I see?
- No.
I wouldn't want to live if he died.
Now if there's anything we need we'll be alright.
Mark, Mark.
Anna.
Wait there.
How's that then eh?
I thought you weren't ever coming back.
Come on, there's lots to show you...
You've really kitted out the place good this time.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Nothing, just pleased to see you.
Come on, let's walk along the cliffs.
Here, I want to show you something.
- Can you do rollovers?
- Yeah.
You haven't done them properly until you've done them here, my way.
What do you mean "your way"?
Sit in front of me.
Keep your head well in and imagine you're half of a wheel.
Now pull me.
Again!
How am I getting on in your world?
You're recovering but not as fast as here.
- So I'm different here?
- Don't know.
I don't care what happens to me there, as long as I can be here with you.
You see, your world doesn't matter any more, we can live here.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Me neither.
Is this snogging?
I've walked as far as I can along these cliffs but there's no way down.
- We should draw a ladder then.
- There's not one long enough...
And even if there was I wouldn't go down there, would you?
I know I'm getting better but that's just stupidity.
- You suggest something then?
- Helicopter?
- I don't think I can draw that.
- I can.
I brought it with me this time.
You draw the helicopter.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Do you think it'll work for me?
- Don't know.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to draw.
Wait.
You can't go yet.
Well you wait down here and keep a look out for it.
I can see better from up there.
To be honest I'd rather draw by myself, I don't like people watching me.
- And I never saw you draw did I?
- I suppose not.
- You wait down here then.
- Ok.
Don't go without me.
Please don't go without me.
I've got some good news...
They've given me a job at head office so I don't have to go away anymore.
That's good isn't it?
We can all be together like a proper family.
Things aren't the same between you and me since I got back, are they?
I missed you when I was away but now I feel as if I'm missing you even more.
I'm worried.
- I went to see your doctor.
- Why?
Mum said you were having bad dreams about me, is that true?
Do you want to see someone about the dreams?
- I don't have them anymore.
- Maybe because I'm back.
No, it's nothing to do with you.
What did Dr Nichols say?
She said you knew a patient of hers who died.
What's the matter?
Mark's dead.
Didn't you know?
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry...
I knew, it's just when I last saw him I sort of hoped he'd get better.
Was he a close friend?
Dr Nichols didn't tell me the whole story.
Obviously.
Mark would hate anybody being sorry.
Come on Anna.
Did you seen those boats there?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Madden.
Hello, is everything ok?
That's good.
After lunch we'll go for a walk down to the front.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Don't lose it.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
- What on earth for?
- Being so miserable.
Don't be stupid.
It was the illness, when I was ill I thought I saw funny things.
I want to go to the pier...
to get Karen some rock.
- Well we'll go after we've eaten.
- Good.
- Shall I open your curtains.
- Whatever you like.
Be careful you don't get sunstroke.
Mark, I'm back.
Mark.
Mark, let me in.
Mark.
Mark.
Mark, let me in.
Let me in.
I don't want to go without you but the helicopter's been hovering all day.
I think I'm meant to go.
Wait for me here, I'll come back for you, love Mark.
Mark, Mark, Mark!
Anna!
Move back from the edge, it's dangerous.
I can't reach.
Move back from the edge Anna, it's dangerous.
- Anna, move away!
- I can't reach.
Mark, I can't reach, don't leave me.
- Anna, it's dangerous.
- I can't reach.
- Move away from the edge.
- Don't leave me.
- Bye Anna.
- No!
He's alright now mum, I know he is.
So tell us exactly what happened well we went over to my room yes and I took off my clothes ok And then I took his clothes off go on and then we did it how many times?
I don't know, once maybe twice he was doing okay then what happened well then he told me he was broke and could
I give him a break what'd you do next?
Well I went over to the closet and I took out a sexual enhancement device
And is this the device?
Yeah that's it then what did you do?
I'll show ya
(music) every time I look out my window it hits me Los Angeles, the city of the angels
I'd like to meet the sick son of a bitch that thought that one up he must've had one wicked sense of humor things had been relatively quiet until the middle of June I say relatively as in relative to any giant
sewer that has 8 million rats scrurrying around looking for something to gnaw on now that's the kind of quiet that makes L.A.
the kind of place it is Anyway
Around mid-June someone must have turned over a big rock because something weirder than the normal weird began chewing up the local citizenry and spitting little pieces all over Glitter City
Where it started or exactly when I'm not sure I don't think the cops even know but on a warm night, not long enough ago to suit me, things were beginning to take shape somewhere on the other side of town and it wasn't gonna be a pretty picture
The West Side Bar the kind of dark, quiet, sleazy place where dark, quiet, sleazy things happen on a regular basis every now and then, someone dies you from around here?
Yeah where you from?
Seattle just down here for a few weeks on a job me too what's your name, Seattle?
Bo.
Bo Hansen Bo, Bo Hansen?
What are you, a circus clown?
Not Bobo, just Bo my name, smart ass.
Bo Hansen well look who got up on the wrong side of the construction site this morning what you need is some TFC to calm you down TFC?
What the hell is TFC?
It's Tender Fucking Care you big stiff you're a hooker, aren't you?
Hey you moron I'm a lady any jerk can see that but I do, occasionally, provide services to release tension in our city's workforce a social worker of sorts
God knows you could use some social work something got ya down, don't it baby?
Yeah but I don't wanna talk about it why don't you let Momma Mercedes buy you a drink at her place it's cheaper there I doubt that
Oh come on, Bo you could tell me how they sink those big girders in all that wet cement Mercedes, huh?
Man I bet you're as expensive as a fuckin Mercedes Benz don't you worry about that for big studs like you I can arrange financing what do ya say?
Ah fuck it, come on let's go this is your place?
Yeah...
Howard Hughes left it to me when he died haven't seen anything like this since I left

Just keep those eyes closed and leave the driving to us, big boy oh yeah oh yeah baby that's it oh drag me to heaven take me to heaven Your request is my demand!
Oh no!
Oh nooooo!
(screaming) pieces started floating to the surface of the sewer around mid-June cops immediately thought a serial killer was at large well the M.O. was consistent, somebody liked a good chainsaw but murder's not usually my racket
my name's Jack Chandler I find missing people, not pieces
Once in a while, the two jobs overlap I'd been hired to find a runaway teenage beauty from Oxnard I was hired by the beauty's mother
Seems the beauty's stepfather had been tucking her into bed a little too tight and she decided to split to the big city personally, I felt she couldn't be doing any worse than the deal she had at home As usual, I was 100% wrong
Harrison at metro had a freaked out girl that matched that description of my runaway in custody the charge: makin McNuggets with a chainsaw
I don't give a good God damn now you listen to me, put the gloves on, open the bag, that's right, and count 'em again
Jackson, you're the coroner, if your stomach can't handle it, who's can?
I don't care how many lunches you lose I wanna know how many victims are in that bag and I wanna know soon or I'll find another coroner!
How's business, Mick?
Chandler.
Just what I need today, a private dick in my face
Come on Mick, let's have a little professional courtesy, huh?
After all, we're both on the same side of the law
Only because you haven't been caught, yet now you don't wanna believe all those things you read in those dime novels, do ya?
Some of us are honest that's what this town's been needing for a long time, an honest dick I'll tell ya, I'm about as honest as any man on the force then you should be locked up
what do you want, Jack?
Looking for a girl name's Samantha Kelso goes by Sam sometimes I heard you had somebody down in lock up, looks just like her thought I might get lucky you mean the nut with the chainsaw?
You get a name on her yet?
Nah, the boys in interrogation screwed up big time they thought the sight of the murder weapon might shock her into spilling her guts only problem was they forgot to take the gas out of it and she spilled their guts instead she's a first class looney
and we have no way of I.D.ing her so far can I see her?
What the hell... why not?
Have some men bring the Cuisinart queen in from lock up thanks, Mick no problem.
So, what's the story on this one?
You know, typical runaway.
Daddy bounces her on the wrong knee one too many times, she goes searching for a new daddy town's full of 'em yeah?
Daddies or runaways?
Both.
And I thought I was burned out bring her in you can wait outside the door.
Yes sir sit down hello Hi well?
Close, but no cigar what's your name, sweetheart?
Lori, what's yours?
Jack.
You from around here Lori?
Uh-huh You ever been to Oxnard?
No but I've been around the world a few times you ever seen this girl?
What's the matter, chainsaw got your tongue?
You guys are kinda cute both of ya say, how'd you two boys like to take a little trip with Lori, huh?
All you gotta do is pick my lock forget it, psycho
Officer Roberts, escort this freak back to lock up
Oooh talk tough to me daddy, it turns me on get her outta here, now!
Let's go see ya later, boys don't bet on it tough break, Chandler
Nah, nah no sweat I'd have been worried if it was really her, that woulda been too easy yeah what?
Sir, they just brought something in that you might want to take a look at, it's down at the lab Okay I'll head down that way
Never ends.
I'll walk with ya yeah, ok set of keys, lip balm, mascara looks like, and uh what do ya got?
The boys on the beat found this stuff on the sidewalk dog was playing with it let's see it this from uptown?
No sir, they found it in West L.A. get some prints off those and run 'em through the computer yes sir let me know when you find the rest of 'em sir!
There's something else in here, stuck to the bottom what is it?
A matchbook no shit!
Could it be a clue?
Everything's a clue, son well, uh, see you around guys hey Harrison, wait for me No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake that girl Lori off my mind her face, her voice
the way she looked at us it all kept bugging me, but it wasn't getting me any closer to finding Samantha Kelso neither was coming here, but it made me feel better this is where Sally lives, Sally's my girl,
sort of deep down I felt there was some connection between that chainsaw-happy chick and my missing girl
I saw the look in her eyes when she saw Samantha's picture she knew her from somewhere and the cops had come up with another victim, or at least part of him maybe there was another killer out there
just maybe Something told me to pinch the matches when
I first saw them someone had scrawled a number inside the matches and a name, Mercedes had the guy been trying to buy a car and wound up in a used parts department himself?
Sally was out like a light but the night was still young so I decided to get back to work being a dick is a 24-hour a day job where the fuck do you think you're going now?
Sally woke up and had that longing look in her eye begged me not to leave, but I told her I had a dangerous job I had to go on and she understood, she wished me well, threw me a kiss
what can I tell ya, the kid just loved me I told her I'd be real careful and I'd come back as soon as I could tears welled up in her eyes as I walked out the door meanwhile, across town
are you Lisa?
Yeah you Hermie Beamer?
Just call me Herman yeah, alright okay Hermie, what do you got to drink around here?
Is sour mash alright?
It'll do for a start what's in the suitcase?
24 inches of fun I beg your pardon?
Toys, for big boys oh so tell me Hermie, what's on your beady little mind?
Well, I um, would like to take some pictures nude that's doable it's not for me, for my business
Hermie, you're not going to sell naked pictures of me on the street... no!
I wouldn't do that this is for a calendar, advertising my product and what exactly is it that you sell?
Baseball bats nude calendars for baseball bats... all the little leaguers just love 'em church groups do, too ok Hermie, it's your ballgame let's see if you can go the whole 9 innings hold it, hold it oh great!
Oh great, bring back... oh hold it oh yes, that's perfect just hold that perfect oh that's really good why are you coming so close?
I can't keep it in focus why are you coming so close?
I can't do it if you come this close!
Well Hermie, it looks like your calendar idea was ahead of it's time while Herman's evening may have been... cut short... mine was just getting started I came back to my office to dial the number
on the matchbook it rang a long time, something deep inside me hoped there'd be no answer no such luck.
A woman picked up the phone she said she was selling, but not a car
Mercedes was her name low miles, built for comfort not speed
I played it cool and agreed to meet her at the West Side for a drink after I hung up I began to wonder if the finger prints on the matchbook would turn out to be hers another death by dismemberment in the news
tonight, this brings the total up to 5 over the last 2 weeks
Detective Harrison of the metro division made a statement this afternoon attributing the most recent death to an accident the guy was just cleaning his chainsaw when it went off yeah sure, maybe it was a suicide
I didn't believe Harrison's theory any more than the d.j. did, but I understood it
I knew what the police statement was all about it was just a little fairy tale to help the kids sleep at night at the time I was a lot more concerned about meeting this mysterious dame alone than what the radio had to say about the chainsaw killer
if I was on the trail of one of these psychos, I wanted to make sure I didn't end up in a paper bag like the last guy who lit these matches who knows, maybe I'd get lucky and the dame could lead me to Samantha Kelso and I could
wrap up the case nice and clean and pay last month's rent little Jack lucky that's what they called me yeah... sure...
it didn't look like my date had arrived yet,
I wasn't quite sure who I was looking for all Mercedes said was that her headlights were great I decided to get a drink and bug the bar hop a little What'll it be, pal?
Bourbon, with a bourbon chaser think I'll have to write that down
I decided to flash the missing girl's picture around while I waited first I showed him Samantha Kelso's photo then I showed him a picture of a chainsaw
I'd torn out of a magazine at Sally's place still nothing then I showed him how to make a shadow bunny on the wall nothing phased this guy I hope you haven't been waiting long no I... just got here you're uh...
Mercedes oh, how'd you pick me out?
You're the only man in here buy you a drink?
Yeah, first let's get a table okay
So, tell me, uh...
Jack Jack, so tell me Jack how did you come by my number?
An acquaintance of mine passed it on to me yeah, he said that he was very very happy with the headlights and upholstery Jack?
Yeah I'm going to fuck your brains out
I didn't like the sound of that Well I'll get the drinks oh, don't bother this one's on me besides, I know the bartender personally he might get mad if I don't come by to say
hello oh yeah, he's a real social kind of guy
Mercedes certainly seemed to have her engine racing but that didn't make her guilty of murder, if that was the case the whole town would be in trouble of course that didn't rule her out, either
I looked over at the little number on the stage she was shaking it pretty good, even if no one was watching you could've knocked me over with a pubic hair there she was, Samantha Kelso humping it out on that little stage for anyone
who could stick a buck down her pants maybe my luck had started to change
I checked the photo to make sure it was her all right.
A little slinkier and a little more seasoned than when the picture was taken, but then city life will do that to a dish like her warning bells started going off in my head so I decided to put in a call to Harrison if there were going to be fireworks, I wanted
to make sure my friends in blue were invited to the party
Hello Metro?
You have reached the metropolitan police homicide division.
All operators are currently busy.
Please hold.

Thank you Damn answering machines!
I didn't have time to wait for the metro boys to get around to my call my date was back I'm sorry, I had to go wash up it's kind of a rough day well, let's hope that your evening goes a
little smoother yeah, let's hope are you looking for someone, Jack?
Hmm?
It's not nice to make your date jealous oh I'm sorry, just this habit I have.
I'm sort of a people watcher well, I like to participate more than spectate well, different strokes for different folks, that's what makes a superbowl what's that you're driking, anyway?
It's a Screaming Orgasm somehow I knew it would be...
I just love intelligent men yeah, I'm kind of an... noticing that you're kind of... you're...
I'm a real scream once you get to know me Oh yeah, little Jack lucky, that's what they should call me alright I've got more luck than anyone should have a right to unfortunately, it's all bad
oh well, I guess I should've been looking at the glass instead of the ass, that'll teach me Yeah, sure it will if my head wasn't hurting so much I'd have sworn I was in heaven
heaven for guys who liked big tits but my head was hurting, and I wasn't in heaven
I wasn't even close don't say a thing lie back, be still you've been through a terrible ordeal what happened?
On my way home tonight I found you in the gutter I thought you were dead well I guess I'm lucky you bumped over me, huh?
Lot of people wouldn't have had the nerve to do that
I'm so glad you didn't die on me that would've been awful yeah... where am I exactly anyway?
In my apartment do you remember what happened?
I was in a bar with a beautiful girl having a drink, and all of a sudden lights out is that it?
That's all I remember.
Sorry it's not a very exciting story well, I was looking through your wallet for a little identification you're a detective private eye, I trace missing persons mostly that must be very exciting oh yeah, it's a barrel of laughs I thought you might be chasing after some
murderers or kidnappers or something no nothing that spectacular, just a teenage runaway somewhere along the line I must've slipped on a piece of shit and landed in here with you why don't you call the police?
Well I tried, couldn't get through oh I'm so glad Jack because I have you all to myself now for a moment there I thought I was paralyzed, then I noticed, my hands and feet were tied sister, what's with the bondage routine here
I just didn't want you running away before I could get to know you better well that was it I'd been played for a 14 karat gold plated goof one more time if there was an award for suckers given out
annually I'd have to buy a bigger mantle piece now girls, girls, ordinarily this would be a real picnic for me but see, I've been seeing this other lady recently we're sort of going steady you know, so somehow
I don't feel right about this how dare you act like a pack of wild animals in my presence we didn't hear you come in we were just preparing him no kidding.
Get out till I call for you
Well I'm sure lucky you showed up when you did don't be so sure Ilsa now now honey not in front of the guest you don't have to do that, I took a bath only yesterday whoa!
We're very honored to have you here, Mr. Chandler cut it out, cut it out let me rephrase that...
ahhh!
Please Mr. Chandler, think of the neighbors they're trying to sleep very good work Ilsa there, I think that's clean enough you see, you've stumbled on us at a very bad time Jack bad for you, that is better?
That's the biggest bra I ever tasted you're an amusing fellow it's a shame we won't have more time to chat oh yeah?
I got plenty of time, I don't have another appointment till noon tomorrow
I'm afraid you'll have to cancel that, you'll be otherwise engaged at that time
I suppose you are wondering what's going on huh, no, seems typical to me but I will admit that the sight of that chainsaw on the nightstand has my curiosity piqued it's a very important part of our religion oh.. sort of a means to an end, so to speak
much more than that it is the cosmic link by which all things are united oh really?
See I would've thought it was the other way around doesn't seem like you kids have been doing much uniting of anything around here lately
Just what is it you think we have been doing?
The way I see it, you guys have got this black market body part transplant business where you take the arms and legs of young studs and you give 'em to rich old fucks who can't hack it anymore you know, sort of a love "em and cleave 'em"
racket with a little quality control department on the side the girls?
Yeah yeah these high powered vacuum pumps with tits an imaginative theory, but you're way off the mark these women are actually my minions, my disciples oh yeah?
What are you, the high priest kind of character or somethin?
What is this, some ancient chainsaw worshiping cult?
Actually, that"s just what it is oh yeah?
What do you do, pray to Black Decker?
Our religion has it's roots in the Egypt of my ancestors come on, they didn't have chainsaws back then but there were the chainsaws of the gods there are many things that modern man has failed to understand
our cult needs sacrifices, human sacrifices, frequently the blade of the saw purifies the evil flesh and makes it holy to please our god and this is that big night for you huh?
That really special sacrifice when you get the chance to live for another hundred years or so, right?
How do you know this?
I read about it in the Enquirer so what are you gonna do now?
You gonna hack us up right here?
Nothing so archaic Mr. Chandler.
We're gonna take you to our temple downtown Makes for a much nicer ceremony
Well a lot can happen between here and Chop City, big fella perhaps you're right, better cut him up now No wait!
Buddy!
It was just a joke.
I really wouldn't do that, actually I'd probably enjoy being in the ceremony you know?
Come to think of it, I haven't been to church in weeks maybe I'd learn something little late for that we can't trust you to behave yourself you're making a big mistake here now
I bet your god would get off on a heathen soul like mine don't you worry about that This isn't an official ceremony, he will know what are we supposed to do?
All right!
Let's get to it!
Don't we get to (moaning) first?
Nah, it's almost time for Letterman hey wait a minute... hey I thought you said you were going to fuck my brains out oh I was!
But this is much faster!
Hey kid!
How about helping me out, huh?
You're the reason I got into this mess all I was trying to do was deliver a message from your mother I wasn't planning on turning into a deli platter is this absolutely necessary?
I mean don't they have hors d'oeuvres back at the temple?
Time to say goodnight!
Damn!
We're out of gas you idiot!
I told you to stop at Texaco on the way here well, come on there's a mini mart right down the street ok
Samantha, you stay here and watch this guy ok hey pick me up a slushie while you're at it, will ya?
Cherry, if they've got it you're not gonna let 'em use that oversize veg-o-matic on me, are ya?
Untie me and I'll take you home to mom I don't want to go home it's ok, she kicked out your stepfather, he's not gonna bother you anymore mom kicked Mike out of the house?
You seem upset, I thought that'd be good news no, I kinda liked Mike I thought he was the reason that you...
Shhh!
We can't talk now listen up, those sickos killed a friend of mine up in Oxnard she told me all about them before she disappeared she was hanging out with them and everything was nice and innocent just some religious freakiness but then they found her head in a garbage
can and I knew what had happened so I followed this freak and his whores down to L.A. to infiltrate their group so I could get revenge on these fuckers I didn't want my mom to know what I was doing
I figured she'd try to ground me or something but I didn't know she'd blame it on Mike
I didn't think you had time to talk!
We don't, we don't have time to talk but not if you wanna save your scalp ok kid, you're the boss what's next?
You get the hell out of here
I'm not leaving you now I can't go with you, they're taking me to the temple tonight to be the prime sacrifice somehow I don't think mom would like that too much I have no intentions of being chopped up,
I'm gonna burn that temple over those fuckers' heads you got a lot of guts for a little girl great dancer, too thanks!
The only thing is, you're not thinking clearly see, cause the minute those chainsaw chicks get back and see that you let me go they're gonna start hacking into you real good
I can take care of myself listen sister, your mother paid me to come and get you and bring you back in one piece and I'm not leaving here without you you talk pretty tough when you're untied don't make me use force, kid
I said I'm staying!
It took a while, but I finally found my car stashed on the side of the motel keys in it and everything guess I'm lucky it wasn't stolen well I'd found Samantha Kelso but she'd led me to something even bigger I'd stumbled into the middle of an evil, insidious
cult of chainsaw worshiping maniacs I had to wonder if we'd let our religious freedom go too far in this country or maybe our immigration laws were just too lax I've never been much for politics, but I kept
thinking about that pretty girl's warm head on my lap and then I wondered how many other pretty girls would never be able to put their heads on my lap because they'd been cut off by that refugee from the BTL club and his slice-happy
sluts I started to get mad my first instinct was to go straight to the cops but that was all the way across town, and there was no guarantee they were gonna believe me So I decided to stop by my office and pick
up some supplies I decided to call Harrison at home even though he made me promise never to do that I just didn't feel like listening to the homo squad's answering machine again You've reached the home of homicide detective
Mick Harrison, I'm not here at the moment but you might be able to reach me at the metro homicide division if you care to leave a message, wait for the beep unless you're Jack Chandler, in which case
you can hang up Jack I told you a hundred times not to call me at home!
Yeah Harrison this is Jack Chandler, I know I'm not supposed to call you at home but this is really, really important I just found out your chainsaw killer is not working alone there's a whole pack of 'em and they're being
led by some crazed chainsaw worshiping priest I'll fill you in on the details later, alright?
Look, meanwhile get down to the Purdone lane area they've got some kind of warehouse there they've turned into a sacrificial temple they're gonna have a big party tonight and we're all invited
Oh and Mick, bring your own beer oh god, what happened?
Where are we?
We're in my office pretty neat place, huh?
Yeah...
god the sacrifice will begin soon, we gotta get to the temple no no, just stay right here.
You're in no condition to go anywhere I feel like I've been hit with a brick
Yeah sorry I had to cold cock you like that that's okay, you did what you had to do you know maybe you could make up for it...
wait wait wait a minute.. ohhh how old are you kid?
21 Yeah?
You got any proof of I.D.?
I left it at home private dick, huh?
I shoulda known better, there's no such thing in Hollywood who was that?
Well that was Sally She was my girl, sort of
Sorry it's alright
You mean to tell me your mother had no idea why you left?
I guess not well, I told you I liked Mike, and I didn't mind the fact that he liked me back except for my mom, I felt kinda bad for her of course Oh yeah, of course
but it was really a bitch that she got the wrong idea and kicked Mike out well from where I'm sitting, I think Mike could've used some kicking yeah I think you're right it was crummy the way he treated her
he should've respected her oh yeah, like you did what?
C'mon, you're a swell kid, you oughtta be skipping rope in some school yard right now instead of on this wild goose chase this is dangerous you know are you afraid?
Afraid?
Ha.
Let me tell you something sister I've been shot, almost, 5 times
I didn't tell you how they found my friend in that trash can, did I?
In fact a couple times I was almost stabbed besides being chainsawed, five times they had taken skin and torn it along her jaws taken her eyes and gouged them till they hit her chin all the skin on her mouth was cut and looked like she was laughing
but she really wasn't shut up, will ya!
Don't you wanna hear the worst part?
No!
That kid talked like a frosted flake but she had the nicest set of knockers that I'd seen in a long time don't you have any idea what this place looks like?
They never told me.
I don't know, I think it has something to do with importing and exporting
Oh yeah, the old in out routine Jeez, you wish they'd have some kind of a sign Look, there!
This could be it...
wow!
Listen, you sure you want to get involved in this?
You wouldn't believe the things I've done to get this far
C'mon, let's check this place out, quietly gotcha
Gotta be some good way into this place, we just gotta keep looking
I am right behind you Jack?
Yeah?
I'm scared listen kid, this is no time to start thinking about some 3-foot long chainsaw slicing up your midsection besides, I got a gun right here and they don't even know we're here nobody heard that alright, one lousy guy
things aren't working out exactly the way I planned at least we're together yeah, let's hope we can keep it that way shut up!
I am so sorry I got you involved in this you know, you're kinda cute even though you do talk funny thanks
I think yeah you're kinda cute too especially those beautiful...
ah thanks... girls!
How's it hanging?
We'll find out... soon enough have you ever considered therapy?
I'm going to enjoy splattering you Hostile, very hostile but a great set of...
Yeah, I know
Samantha, how you disappointed the Master fuck off, slut now your true nature is revealed my how you deceived us you killed a good friend of mine, Jenny Lynn, remember?
Jenny Lynn?
Jenny Lynn!
Oh yes, she was a snooty little bitch just like you and we had fun with her you're gonna pay for what you did!
Sweet...
what's that?
You've been very naughty, Samantha, but our Master's going to give you one more chance to redeem yourself She's not a book of stamps!
Shut your face, heathen.
She will redeem herself, to eternity oh come on!
I'm sure you've been stuck by worse than that tonight and I hope you enjoyed your little piece because it will be your last and now it's your turn to be a piece, or should I say, pieces
well I guess it all depends on the context Hey Sam you alright?
What was in that needle?
The blood of our ancestors what are you doing, where are you taking her?
Don't worry, you'll be together again soon you're going to be our special guest tonight yeah, and our human sacrifice terrific so good of you to drop by Mr. Chandler you saved us the unpleasant task of having
to go get you Well I'm glad I could be of some help you're going to make an excellent offering to our gods you know Ive been doing a lot of thinking about that lately, I've come to the conclusion
that this building isn't zoned for human sacrifices you guys could get in a whole lot of trouble for doing this I think it's time somebody cut you down to size, Jack.
Oh Horace, great god of the heavens, look down upon us, your faithful servants unworthy in your eyes, let us praise your greatness this night, with our feast of the dead accept our humble offering, that we might
live on to serve and praise you for years to come come forward, high priestess of Anubis come forth and serve thy master go forth, go to the faithful they may taste the blood of Anubis the blood is the life Tonight, oh Horace, we offer you a new disciple
a fresh, untouched flower to adorn the crown of the gods we, your humble slaves, offer you the virgin dance of the double chainsaws
Prepare to meet Anubis yeah well I'll just scurry on home and slip into my tux C'mon, step on it!
I am Chief, I am!
Can't you go any faster?
You know Cheif, this is last year's model got bald tires, needs a tune-up god damn it, it would've been faster with my Volkswagen next time take your damn Volkswagen You know, when I was a kid I used to have
the same problem with my old man's lawnmower he used to get the same expression on his face oh shut up!
Hey, what's with Sam?
She looks kinda distant ah, she's one with the gods yeah well that and a quart of oil will start your buzz saw in your hands you hold the chainsaw of the gods use it wisely kill him!
Kill him!
Now Sam, you're not still sore about that headbutt are ya?
C'mon have a heart!
Way to go!
Talk about cutting it close!
For a minute there I thought you were gonna turn me into chop suey Well I should have!
Maybe my luck's changed at last this must be the place
I think you're right chief go round them up, I'm gonna go look for Jack
Chandler and you boys behave yourselves alright, let's catch as many as we can!
Damn Chandler, what the hell happened?
Glad you could make it, you're a little late what took you so long?
Letterman was on, he had some pretty damn good guests how many times have I told ya, buy a VCR!
You can tape those things crime rate in this town would probably go down 10% then they'd lay me off how'd you find us?
Boys had their eye on this bunch for a long time now we thought they were just smuggling illegal artifacts but after your phone call, pieces all started to fall into place you always know what to say, Mick aren't you going to introduce me to your lady
friend there?
Yeah, Mick this is Samantha Kelso, girl I showed you the picture of
Glad to meet you miss Kelso, you're even prettier than your photograph
Hey Mick, you mind if I fill out the report tomorrow?
I could use a little sack time sure Jack, you look like you need the rest
Look they're gone!
And that just about wraps it up for this case.
It sounds a lot more complicated than it really was hard to believe it all took place in a couple of measly nights back in June when somebody paid me a few bucks to find their missing daughter
I thought I should put all this down on paper because they never did find the guy that called himself the Master I don't wanna appear paranoid or anything,
I just get a creepy feeling when I think about that guy.
I mean sure, I saw Sam give him an unscheduled appendectomy but something deep down inside tells me we haven't seen the last of him.
I hope I'm wrong Huh, I usually am.
This time I'd be glad to be wrong, but if I'm not and something happens to Sam or me
I just thought there should be a record of what we went through maybe it can be of help to someone in the future who might run into another chainsaw cult I'm sure there are others.
Oh yeah, as for Sam, she's a big girl, her mother was happy when she heard Sam was safe and I needed a secretary, like a hole in the head but she's a nice kid so maybe I'll let her stay around a while
besides, she's got a great set of tits.
This is what I need today.
A flat!
Oh, this is great.
Joe.
It's what you get when you lend somebody a car.
Hello sweetheart, having car trouble?
Uh, yes, I have a flat.
Uh, you need a man to help you change a tire?
That would be wonderful, but I don't have spare.
Well hop on, I'll give you a ride to the gas station.
Well, I'm a little afraid of this bike.
It'll be just like being in your mother's arms.
Well, I guess I have no choice.
Just go slow.
Would you stop this goddamn thing already please!
Please.
Where you going sweetheart?
Look, you said you were going to take me to a gas station, right?
You didn't take me to a gas station.
You took me for a nice little ride, which I hated.
Now I can make my own way back.
Thank you very much.
But sweetheart, you didn't pay me for the ride yet.
Look, I'm not gonna pay you for anything,
YQU got that?
You asked me to go on this thing.
I didn't ask you.
And I hated it, goodbye.
Sweetheart, I don't want money, lwant you.
- Oh yeah, yeah?
- Like hell!
May I help you?
Thank you for stopping.
That son of a bitch.
I hope I killed him.
Do you think you could take me into town?
I would really appreciate it.
Of course.
You have a commitment from the governor.
Oh, Jean be sure to get a confirmation of that at least two weeks in advance.
He's not the most reliable person we know, right?
If that's it, Mayor, I'd like to get back to the station.
You know I'm working on that Mary Lawrence case.
Oh yes, a shame.
Any progress, Chief?
Not a damn thing.
Well the meeting is adjourned.
Thank you all, goodnight.
Good night.
Good night, good night.
Oh, oh Jean.
Thank you for staying late.
I hope I haven't spoiled your plans for the evening.
No, not tonight.
I think I'm just gonna crawl into bed early and maybe read a little.
Oh, I wish I could do the same.
I'm gonna be here another two hours at least.
Oh, do you mind typing up the minutes for me before you go?
Can do.
Ah, thank you again Jean.
Thank you.
Okay gentlemen, you can take her out.
Uncle Chickie, did you catch the jugs on that one?
You are one sick bastard.
Hello.
Yeah, uh hi Doc.
No, no, no, no.
No, hm-mn, it's okay.
Yeah.
Ah, so it was a stroke?
Huh, yeah.
I agree, it is a shame, yeah.
Oh, by the way, Doc,
I got a release from the family.
So we can sent the body over to Holland Mortuary in the morning, okay?
Ybah, flghL.
Yeah, thanks for taking care of it.
Yeah.
Bye now.
Hi Mr. Holland, got a delivery for you.
Sign this, please.
Nice day today, isn't it?
You wanna hurry up in there, please?
We got people dyin' to see us.
Chillies.
Morons.
He ought to be talking to you.
I know he didn't mean me.
I'm sure you know now, I never meant to hurt you.
You're always one of my favorites.
I just want you to look so beautiful for the mayor and everybody.
After all, a promise is a promise.
Isn't that right, Mary?
What's a bride without a bridesmaid?
I'll be right back.
Not Hazel, I wasn't good enough.
Nicolas!
Oh, my feet are killin' me.
Hazel, were you out there a minute ago?
He's so ungrateful.
I mean he runs right by me, just like I was nothin'.
He knocks me down.
Who are you talking about?
Nicky, of course.
He ran outta here just before I came in.
Well, I know her.
She's the mayor's secretary.
They say it was a stroke.
It's all that damn smoking.
I'm tellin' ya.
Look, Hazel I have a lot of work to do.
It's a shame, shame.
I have a lot of work to do Hazel.
All right, I'm goin', I'm goin'.
And some of these tribes use this as a rite of passage into the next world.
Um, excuse me, Miss Hayes.
Yes, David.
Yes, did they really, you know?
You mean did they ejaculate?
Yes.
They believed that by ejaculating into the corpse, the man could take his seed into the next world, in case he dies in battle with rival tribes, and never had the opportunity to father children.
That's sick.
Miss Hayes?
Kris?
What if no one volunteers for this great honor?
What if nobody dies?
Well, in that case they'd have to have a sacrifice.
But that's murder, right?
I mean, come on, they kill somebody.
Yes, murder to us, but to them it was a religious ritual, and integral part of their culture.
Does it still go on?
Yes, in some of the occults groups we read about today.
But you mean in Africa and Haiti, voodoo and stuff like that.
It's a surprising fact that according to statistics, more cases of necrophilia were reported in the United States than anywhere else in the world.
Well, that's all the time we have today class.
Wait for me outside.
Miss Hayes?
Nicolas.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
It's all right, what can I do for you?
Could we talk just a little bit more about today's subject?
Oh, gee, I'm really sorry.
I'm in a bit of a rush.
Please.
Just a couple of minutes.
I really need to talk to someone.
It's kinda personal.
Personal?
It's about this.
Necrophilia?
Yeah, I think so.
You think so?
Nick, what are you talking about?
Could you meet me tonight?
Nick I'm really flattered, and I must admit that was a novel approach, but uh, I'm sorry.
Miss Hayes, I'm serious.
I think I have something interesting to show you.
Nick, again, I'm sorry, but I can't tonight.
All right, if you change your mind let me know.
Where'd you wanna take me?
My Uncle's funeral home.
You know, that's not the best offer
I've had in a long time.
If I change my mind I'll let you know.
_ okay-
Good bye.
I thought you said you were only gonna be a couple of minutes?
Sorry Angie, I had something to discuss with Miss Hayes.
I'll bet.
Come on, I'll take you home.
Wait a minute.
I'm not going anywhere unless you tell me what could be so personal that you could tell Miss Hayes but you can't tell me.
Drop it Angela, all right.
I told you, it has nothing to do with us.
It was a personal thing, all right.
Nick!
When's it gonna get personal between you and me?
I mean, I don't even know when the last time we made love is.
Angela drop it, all right.
I haven't got time for this.
If you're so unhappy with me, find someone else.
Don't be afraid.
I'll be with you soon.
So I'm just getting into necrophilia in my anthropology course.
- Necrophilia?
- Yeah.
- What?
- Ls that mandatory?
No, it is not mandatory.
But I like to cover everything.
May I finish?
Yes, go ahead.
Thank you.
So I have this one student, Nick Leonard.
I don't know, you know him?
Yeah, nice buns.
That's him.
He comes to me after class and he tells me he'd like to show me something relative to the subject.
Guess where he wanted to take me?
Where?
To his uncle's funeral home.
Sounds pretty kinky.
Not quite my speed.
Look Pam, do yourself a favor.
Don't give these guys any weird ideas.
They're already crazy enough.
You are absolutely right.
Well, I am going to go put myself into some sweetness.
Hello.
Miss Hayes?
' Yes.
Hi, it's Nicky.
Nick Leonard.
Look, I'm sorry to call you at home, but I must see you.
Oh look, Nicky, I'm right in the middle of something.
Can this wait 'til class?
No, it's just really important that I meet you tonight.
Nick, look.
I'm really flattered, but I, I don't think we ought to go out of the bounds of the student-teacher relationship.
You know, and besides, I am seeing somebody.
No, it's nothing like that.
It's just that, well, what I'm talking about...
Look, you gotta see it for yourself or you're never gonna believe me.
Look, Nick.
Please, you gotta trust me.
Just give me 10 minutes.
I'm begging you.
Better not be some sort of fraternity joke.
This is no joke.
Meet me at my uncle's funeral home in 20 minutes.
Okay.
Oh, and Miss Hayes.
' Yes.
The address is 242 Lamont Avenue.
Thanks Miss Hayes.
Thanks for coming Miss Hayes.
I really appreciate it.
We'd better hurry.
Hey, don't rush me.
I'm gonna tell you again, this better not be a joke.
This is no joke.
Come on, he'll be back soon.
We'd better hurry.
So what?
Hey Nick, this, you know, you're not gonna do something crazy?
No, but he is.
What do you mean?
Come on, I'll show you.
Be quiet, I don't wanna wake up my aunt.
All right.
Nick, where the hell we going now?
My uncle's laboratory.
But be quiet.
Great, just great.
Wait here.
Wait here?
Oh great.
Nicolas, where are you going?
Nicolas!
Damn, he must've put the body in the coffin.
It must be upstairs.
Oh thank God for that, now let's get the hell out of here.
I don't know why I let you talk me into this in the first place.
No wait, look, I know you think I'm nuts, but I can prove it.
Prove what?
He's an Undertaker.
Now, let's get the hell out of here.
Nick!
Nicolas.
What are you looking for now?
The photographs, but I can't find them.
Roscoe, is that you?
What are you doing working there so late?
Damn, that's my aunt.
Oh my God, if she tells him.
Come on.
Damn neighbors changing everyday.
Now they're trying to rob the dead.
Come on.
Nothing's sacred, nothing's sacred.
Pretty gory, huh?
Yeah.
Well you must really like this movie, sir.
How many times have you seen it?
Moron.
Asshole.
I know, I'm late again.
You're always late, Billy.
You made me go to the movies by myself, and then you pick me up late, it's not fair.
I know, I know.
I promise it won't happen again.
You've been saying that for how long now?
Thanks Nancy.
Sorry to call you on such short notice.
It's all right, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh, and I'll probably need you next week too.
I'm available.
Now you sure you don't need a ride home?
I'm sure.
Thank you.
Good night, Nancy.
Good night.
I don't know why you're crying, I learned this tonight.
You don't know what it's like to never have a body warm and soft.
Like in the movie.
Sleep my love, sleep.
J1 Rock-A-Bye baby flOn.
No, Uncle Roscoe.
I don't want to.
No.
I don't want to.
No, Uncle Roscoe.
You bastard.
You sick fucking bastard.
Oh Nicky, can I be of some assistance to you my dear boy?
You sick bastard.
You sick fucking perverted bastard.
Sick and perverted, Nicolas.
This is your uncle.
Since your mother died, and your so-called father left you,
I sent you to school, I remind you, Nicolas.
I'm surprised at you.
Miss Hayes said in school today that people like you should be put away.
Miss Hayes?
Some slut?
You'd take some sluts word over your uncle, who loves you?
Nicolas, you're breaking my...
- Loved me?
- Yes.
You never loved me.
Yes I do.
You're breaking my heart.
I'll kill you for what you did.
Really?
I'll kill you for what you did!
Do you know about pressure points Nicolas?
On, Nicky.
Nicolas, you've been a very big disappointment to me.
But there's someone I want you to meet.
It's your Aunt Nancy.
She's precious, isn't she?
Look at her Nicolas, look at her.
Don't worry, Nick.
She'll be joining you on that long journey.
I'm just going to put you to sleep.
Don't be afraid.
Calm yourself.
Do you think Uncle Roscoe would hurt you Nicholas?
I love you.
What is this?
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God!
Have you seen Nick Leonard today?
No, but that's not unusual.
I don't have him in any of my classes this year.
Hm, he didn't show up for mine, and he never misses.
What do you have the hots for this guy or something?
You have got a one-track mind.
Why, thank you.
I am just a little concerned after last night.
I think it's a little weird, you know.
Uh, I gotta go, it's late.
- I'll see ya later.
- See ya later.
Mary Lawrence who disappears about a week ago.
Or the Bowen kid, who disappears last night.
Too much of a coincidence, right?
Well, what's our next move, Chief?
I don't know what the hell we got going on here.
We better call in the state police.
_ okay-
- Let's go.
- All right.
Hang in there, okay.
You'll be all right, alright?
You hang in there.
So, you think there's some connection between this and the disappearance of the two girls?
Look, the Bowen girl was as reliable as the sunrise.
And the other kid, Mary Lawrence, not the type to just take off.
Well the coroner can pinpoint age, sex, method, blood type.
If what you found belongs to one of those two girls, we'll know soon enough.
So, we can assume we're dealing with a psycho.
Probably a drifter.
Nah, no 'cause a drifter wouldn't stay long.
You know, he's too noticeable in a small town like this.
And those disappearances were a week apart.
How 'bout a college kid?
Ain't never had any trouble with 'em before.
They can't even drink here.
This town's dry.
Well, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.
Let's see what the coroner has to say.
I got the paperwork all cleared up.
This whacko is following this picture scene by scene.
This movie's his MO.
You gonna start using that police jargon again?
If you wanted to be a cop you should've taken the test.
Hey look Louise, you think just because
I'm a security guard, it means I can't solve a crime?
I can't make arrests?
Listen Sherlock, I've got work to do.
Oh come on Louise, take a look at it.
Let's just look at the murder scene.
One, we got a gruesome murder.
Blood scattered everywhere.
There are pieces of guts and intestines laying scattered about.
Listen, I just, I just ate.
Why don't you go talk to the projectionist, okay?
I'm sure he's seen it more times than you.
Oh now, Louise, I always thought you were brighter than the rest of these hicks.
I mean, let's look, even the missing bodies are in here.
And let me tell ya something Louise, this guy's been in this theater, and he's seen this picture five or six times.
And you know what?
He's coming back.
Roscoe dear, it was a beautiful funeral you did, you know.
You made it look so peaceful.
Thank you, Hazel.
And the mayor and his wife both commented how natural she looked.
Good.
You know, just the other day I was thinking how the neighborhood has changed, you know, with the scene in the park, and those kids trying to break in.
What kids, break in where Hazel?
Well, it slipped my mind.
What, what are you are you talking about Hazel?
I remember now.
I heard voices coming from your laboratory, and I went there, and I thought it was you.
But as I turned on the light,
I saw this young woman running out the back door.
Did you call the police, Hazel?
No I didn't.
Nothing was missing.
You think I should have?
Hello.
Administration, Mrs. Thomas speaking.
Yes, Chief, sorry.
How can I help you?
Yes, I know it's here somewhere.
Bear with me.
I found it, Chief.
Let's see.
Oh that's Hayes.
H-A-Y-E-S, right Chief?
Pamela Hayes.
165 Clermont Avenue.
165 Clermont.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
You moron.
Angela, how ya doin'?
Hi, Mr. Holland.
Is Nicky here?
No, the last time I saw him he was with you.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.
Mm-hm.
We had a fight.
He's not at his apartment.
Did you go there?
Did you call him?
Yeah.
Well don't worry about it.
We've always been very high-strung in the family, but I'm sure that when I see him
I can get you kids back together again.
Thank you.
Will you have him call me?
I certainly will.
Damn.
Where are those matches?
Hey Pam, you wanna grab those paper towels in the back seat of the car?
Yeah, I got 'em.
Well naturally I thought there was some kind of connection between necrophilia and his uncle.
God, I hope he calls me tomorrow.
My curiosity is driving me crazy.
Well, you think we should call the police?
And tell them what?
We don't have any proof of anything.
I'm not even sure if Nick was involved.
Look we'll talk about it tomorrow.
I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Yeah, night Man.
Did you hear the phone?
Jesus Christ, you scared the hell outta me.
It's your mom.
I'll be right there.
Next time, Miss Hayes.
Next time.
Hey, come in Joe!
How ya doin', Doc?
Said you had something to show me.
This is one for the books, my friend.
What makes this one so different?
The bits of tissue I examined, are those of a woman between the ages 15 to 20 years of age.
As you probably know, the person stops bleeding when the heart stops.
Now, judging by the way the blood coagulated, the girl was alive when she was disemboweled.
Son of a bitch.
It get worse.
Worse?
Aspetta, it get worse.
There are traces of semen on the intestine tissue.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Well I'll get this down to them now and, will you do me a favor, Doc?
What's a matter, Joe?
Would you get rid of the jacket.
I'm dying with the heat.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
In this job you get used to everything!
It's all your fault Nicolas.
All your fault!
Well you'll just have to wait my dear boy.
But not you, my sweet.
I found a suitable companion for your safe journey.
Don't worry.
You know, I'm quite harmless.
That's it.
This ain't my idea of fun excercise.
Oh, I'm so glad you said that.
I quit.
I'm dying of thirst.
Let's get you some water.
Oh Christ.
Look at him, Tarzan of the Apes.
Does he have that kind of energy where it counts?
Oh, and then some.
MWah!
You know Professor Wilson, even when I was your student, I never liked you.
She said it's not unusual for guys Nick's age to take off like that.
You don't buy that, do you?
Sure don't.
So, why don't you call the police?
And tell them what?
That I think Nick's uncle may have done something to him, because he showed me his laboratory?
Oh yeah right.
I can see them coming to arrest me now.
Well if you're not gonna call the police then why don't you just forget about it?
You know, you are really amazing.
Can't you see that there just might be some connection between all these girls that are disappearing in town and Nick?
And what about Mrs. Pavelock, huh?
Next door for Christ's sake?
Did it ever occur to you, just occur to you, that Nick just might be telling the truth about his uncle, huh?
Well then call the fucking police already?
Why don't you make up your mind?
All right, drop it.
Here comes Kevin.
What, quitters?
No pain, no gain.
Hey, where's Stan?
I thought he was joining us.
(50W)'-
Stan's forte is indoor sports.
Hey, you guys are coming to dinner with us tonight, aren't you?
No, we can't.
Stan's working late tonight.
I'm gonna meet him later at his apartment.
But you guys will survive without us, right?
Oh, I think we will survive.
And if we don't, what a way to go.
You didn't get the windshield.
- Sorry Mr.
- Holland, I'll get it now.
Moron.
Moron.
Asshole.
Let's see where you go.
Very clever Mr. Holland, very clever.
Who else would have an easier time getting rid of bodies?
Christ, I'll be the biggest thing to hit this town since...
I need proof, proof.
Oh, and what an invitation.
Look at this.
A funeral.
Bunch of hypocrites.
Oh now Roscoe, why would you say that?
Are you kidding, Hazel?
Sorry for your gain.
They always hated the bastard.
What a sense of humor you have, Roscoe.
I know, Hazel.
Well, can I help you, young man?
Oh no, I'm fine.
I guess I'm a little bit shaken up over the death of my friend.
I can understand that.
Would you like to sit for a while?
No, I'm fine.
It seems like my wife is a little bit late.
You know, I really hate these things.
I can understand, but unfortunately it's one of life's realities.
I'm sure that you would be more comfortable if you came inside.
Much cooler, we have air conditioning.
Oh no, I'm fine.
Just stay out here, until my wife arrives.
Well then you wouldn't mind if I went back inside.
I have a lot of people waiting for me.
Thank you and God bless you, son.
Roscoe, dear, is that young man all right?
Yes Hazel, he became quite ill.
He had to leave.
Well, perhaps he'll feel better tomorrow.
I'm sure he will.
All right.
Mary Lawrence disappears.
No sign of foul play.
And a good kid.
And the Bowen kid, Nancy.
Disappears a few blocks from her home.
Somebody give her a ride?
Well according to Mrs. Hudson, she declined a ride with her.
Now of course she could've been picked up by a school chum butnah, nah.
All her classmates were at home at the time.
Ichecked.
Someone knew she was babysitting.
Waiting for her?
Or she was the victim of opportunity.
Some guy comes cruising along, late at night.
She's a girl, walking alone.
He's gotta be one sick bastard to do what he did to that kid.
I'll tell ya something else that's bothering me.
Yeah, what?
Mrs. Pavelock.
Blood splattered all over the inside of her home.
Now we either have too many acts on our hands, or this guy's changed his pattern.
Excuse me.
Yeah, Chief Banes.
No, it's gotta be the same guy.
Because he's still taking away the bodies.
Where are the bodies?
Could be he's branching' out.
Just got a call from a gal who's boyfriend is missing since Wednesday.
College kid, name's Nick Leonard.
Wednesday.
Same night the Bowen kid disappeared.
Yeah, same night as the Bowen kid.
Hey, come on Louise, can you hurry it up?
What's up with you?
You gotta hot date or something?
No, I got some important things to do, so if you wouldn't mind.
_ I'm going.
Good bye, Louise.
Yeah, good night.
What the fuck you trying to do?
I only wanted some change for cigarettes, man.
You know you could've gotten yourself killed.
Now get outta here.
Tonight I show these small town hicks what a real detective is.
And Mr. Holland you're gonna help me.
I know, I know Jenny, but...
You must be patient.
I've been very, very busy.
Nicolas.
Nicolas.
Oh, Nicolas.
Come on baby, wanna talk about it?
Oh, I just can't get this off my mind.
Poor Jenny next door.
I'm really worried.
Maybe Mandy was right.
Maybe we should call the police.
That's what they're there for.
And what if we're wrong.
What if there's no connection.
Isn't that what you really wanna know?
Yeah.
You're right.
I love you.
I love you.
Listen, listen, I'm gonna call her.
Call her tomorrow, she's with Kevin.
Look I gotta call her tonight, or else I gotta go home.
All right, give her a call.
_ okay-
Pam.
Yeah.
Yeah, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Mandy, what do you want?
Everything I can get.
You better believe it.
Yeah, sounds like I'm the one that's interrupting you.
What's up?
Well, if you really wanna know.
Mandy, why did you call?
Well I guess I was just a little worried about this thing with you and Nicolas.
Who's Nicolas?
Shh!
Well I think you'll really be proud of me.
I finally made a decision to call the police.
Yeah, you did?
That's really great.
So I guess you won't miss me if I don't come home 'til tomorrow, huh?
I'll see you when I see you.
Enjoy yourself.
Okay, bye-
You better be ready to finish me, stud.
Roscoe dear, here's your tea and biscuits.
Oh, thanks Hazel.
You know Mrs. Harrah called.
She said they'll be delivering Mr. Harrah today.
Who is he?
Oh, you remember him.
Ah, you know, he was the one you used to laugh at because his name is the same frontwards and backwards.
And you know, she said you should put his hairpieoe on, or his friends won't recognize him.
Look Hazel, I would appreciate if,
I have a lot of work to do, if you'd just leave me alone for a bit.
All right dear, I'll go upstairs and do what I have to do, I have work too.
Good.
Okay dear, take care of yourself.
I have work to do.
Yes, that's right.
163 Clermont.
Thanks Inspector.
They'll be here in 15 minutes.
I heard.
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
Yeah, I mean, at least it'll be out of your hands.
You got nothing to lose.
Nothing to lose but my credibility as a teacher.
They'll keep it confidential.
Honey, not in this town.
Thanks again, Miss Hayes.
We'll look into it right away.
Let you know if it amounts to anything, all right?
Thank you.
By the way, how do we find this place?
Make a left at the light and a right two lights down.
Thank you, you've been very helpful.
How well did you know Mrs. Pavelock?
We had a nodding acquaintance.
We said hello when we saw her.
Thank you.
Pavelock, coincidence or mistake?
Could be.
She teaches these kids about necrophilia in an anthropology course and then gets spooked by it herself.
Unless she unwittingly triggered some sick mind into doing all this.
You think it's this kid, Leonard?
I'll tell you what I think, partner,
I think she is one lucky lady.
And if the aunt didn't come along when she did,
I think we'd be looking for our Miss Hayes right about now.
Roscoe dear.
What is it, Hazel.
Two nice gentlemen friends to see you.
Would you come in?
Please be seated.
You have my ear.
Sincere condolences, a loved one has passed?
Oh no sir, nothing like that.
We'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
Hazel.
Would your gentlemen friends like some tea?
No thank you ma'am, we won't be long.
Well then I'll be leaving now, dear Roscoe.
Thanks, Hazel.
I guess you're here about Nicky, right?
That's right, son.
Police officers and we've been lead to believe that you know about your nephew's whereabouts.
Well I guess you'll find out sooner or later, so I might as well tell you now.
Find out what son?
About Nicolas.
I promised I would be silent, but I guess I should tell you.
He was helping to dig and, he's just a kid, but what he did to these bodies.
It was incredible.
That's why he brought her here that night.
He came to me and he told me, he begged me for some money, you know.
He said it was an accident.
It was no accident.
I found out the next day it wasn't an accident.
I'll get on the radio and get an APB out on this guy right now Bobby.
He was my dearly departed sister's only son, and I just couldn't tell anybody.
What was I supposed to do, oh God.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Wait, is Hazel out there?
No, we're alone here, Mr. Holland.
Okay, I don't want her to know.
Thank you, Officer.
Poor Nick, you know.
He didn't mean it.
He was...
He was abused when he was a kid.
And what he did to these poor, oh Momma.
Please calm down, sir.
You won't hang Nicky if you find him, will you?
Where does that door lead, sir?
That's uh, my laboratory.
Do you mind if we take a look?
Certainly not.
I'll show you.
Oh Nicky...
Officer Barry.
This is the laboratory.
Where does that door lead, Mr. Holland?
Through the courtyard, Officer.
And this one here?
Hall, the hallway.
And this one over here, sir?
Oh, uh, that's the storage closet.
I'll get the key, it's not open, Officer.
It's open, Sir.
Oh, is it?
I though you said this was a storage closet.
It's Nick.
It's not, it's a storage cellar.
Mind if I go down?
No, not at all.
Nicky, there's some gentlemen here to see you.
I'll be right back.
Officer Barry's in the washroom, would you like some tea?
Oh, uh, no, no, it's fine.
A cold beverage perhaps?
Yeah, something diet'd be nice.
Hm, okay.
No, I don't feel like making dinner tonight.
I'm leaving Stan's house in a few minutes.
I'll bring a pizza.
No, don't.
I wanna go down and try to speak to Nick's aunt.
Are you crazy?
What if his uncle is there?
Look, the police never called me back, like they said they would.
They probably never even went down there.
I've gotta find out.
Just wait for me.
I'm going with you, okay?
Fuck this.
No, I'm at the hospital.
I just, I was on my way out, and I couldn't wait for these cops anymore to tell me what was going on with this guy, Nick, so I just thought I would go over there
and check it out for myself and this guy ran a stop, it wasn't my fault.
He ran the stop sign.
All right, listen, can you just pick me up here?
All right that'd be great.
I guess I'll wait outside.
- Bye.
- Dr. Jorgenson report to emergency stat.
Pam!
Son of a bitch.
Pam.
I gotta be outta my fucking mind.
What am I doing here?
Looking into my parlor there's a spider and a fly.
Oh no!
(Ahuds)
Thanks for the tea.
And for coming to pick me up.
Don't mention it.
You know that accident was probably a sign telling me to stay home and mind my own business.
By the way, where's Mandy?
I don't know, should be here by now.
Maybe she went to pick up some chow?
Oh yeah, she did mention something about pizza.
I told you gentlemen, your patience shall be rewarded.
It's show time.
Look what I've got.
It's marvelous.
Comes in very handy.
Do I hear a plea?
Are you begging for mercy?
Is that drama?
Present.
As I end my refrain,
I press down.
What?
No applause?
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
You don't seem to be their cup of tea.
Perhaps Pamela would be.
Well, my dear, I guess that's show biz.
Well, hello Miss Hayes.
Mandy, you've been a great deal of help to me.
Oh Nicky,
we're going to meet Miss Hayes.
Business hasn't been good lately.
What with these, all these vitamins that people are taking, and the Surgeon General's warning about smoking, the silly driving without drinking laws,
I haven't been able to ship you out that fast.
I guess I'll have to drum up some business.
Pam.
You awake?
Come on, you're not going to sleep on me, are you?
Mm, let me sleep.
Come on, I got a great idea.
I'll be right back.
Kevin!
Kevin, you clutz, what did you break now?
Kevin.
You bitch.
You ought to run.
Indeed.
Nicky.
Soon you'll be joining all your friends, my darling.
But first there's a little service you must perform.
A gesture, you might say, for the problems you caused Nicolas and me.
N, N, very good.
I,
C,
Very good,
K-
Now I forgive you.
Now I forgive you!
[Chiefl Break it in.
God damn.
Oh God.
As I promised you gentlemen, you'll all have travelling companions.
And you lovely, Mandy,
will be back with Pamela again.
(engine rumbling)
- This is what I need today.
A flat!
Oh, this is great.
Joe.
It's what you get when you lend somebody a car.
- Hello sweetheart, having car trouble?
- Uh, yes, I have a flat.
- Uh, you need a man to help you change a tire?
- That would be wonderful, but I don't have spare.
- Well hop on, I'll give you a ride to the gas station.
- Well, I'm a little afraid of this bike.
- It'll be just like being in your mother's arms.
- Well, I guess I have no choice.
- Just go slow.
(upbeat music)
(engine revving)
Would you stop this goddamn thing already please!
Please.
- Where you going sweetheart?
- Look, you said you were going to take me to a gas station, right?
You didn't take me to a gas station.
You took me for a nice little ride, which I hated.
Now I can make my own way back.
Thank you very much.
- But sweetheart, you didn't pay me for the ride yet.
- Look, I'm not gonna pay you for anything,
YQU got that?
You asked me to go on this thing.
I didn't ask you.
And I hated it, goodbye.
- Sweetheart, I don't want money, lwant you.
- Oh yeah, yeah?
- Like hell!
(thudding) (groaning)
(suspenseful music)
- [Driver] May I help you?
- Thank you for stopping.
That son of a bitch.
I hope I killed him.
Do you think you could take me into town?
I would really appreciate it.
- [Driver] Of course.
(foreboding music)
(chilling music)
- You have a commitment from the governor.
- Oh, Jean be sure to get a confirmation of that at least two weeks in advance.
He's not the most reliable person we know, right?
(laughing)
- If that's it, Mayor, I'd like to get back to the station.
You know I'm working on that Mary Lawrence case.
- Oh yes, a shame.
Any progress, Chief?
- Not a damn thing.
- Well the meeting is adjourned.
Thank you all, goodnight.
- [All] Good night.
- Good night, good night.
Oh, oh Jean.
Thank you for staying late.
I hope I haven't spoiled your plans for the evening.
- No, not tonight.
I think I'm just gonna crawl into bed early and maybe read a little.
- Oh, I wish I could do the same.
I'm gonna be here another two hours at least.
Oh, do you mind typing up the minutes for me before you go?
- Can do.
- Ah, thank you again Jean.
- Thank you.
(clock chimes)
(heavy breathing)
(foreboding music) (heavy breathing)
(shower running)
(heavy breathing)
(crickets chirping)
(changing music stations)
(gentle music)
(suspenseful music)
(muffled screaming)
- Okay gentlemen, you can take her out.
- Uncle Chickie, did you catch the jugs on that one?
- You are one sick bastard.
(phone ringing)
- Hello.
Yeah, uh hi Doc.
No, no, no, no.
No, hm-mn, it's okay.
Yeah.
Ah, so it was a stroke?
Huh, yeah.
I agree, it is a shame, yeah.
Oh, by the way, Doc,
I got a release from the family.
So we can sent the body over to Holland Mortuary in the morning, okay?
Ybah,flghL
Yeah, thanks for taking care of it.
Yeah.
Bye now.
- Hi Mr. Holland, got a delivery for you.
Sign this, please.
Nice day today, isn't it?
You wanna hurry up in there, please?
We got people dyin' to see us.
(chuckles)
- Chillies.
- Morons.
- [Driver] He ought to be talking to you.
I know he didn't mean me.
- I'm sure you know now, I never meant to hurt you.
You're always one of my favorites.
I just want you to look so beautiful for the mayor and everybody.
After all, a promise is a promise.
Isn't that right, Mary?
What's a bride without a bridesmaid?
I'll be right back.
- Not Hazel, I wasn't good enough.
(anxious music)
Nicolas!
Oh, my feet are killin' me.
- Hazel, were you out there a minute ago?
- He's so ungrateful.
I mean he runs right by me, just like I was nothin'.
He knocks me down.
- Who are you talking about?
- Nicky, of course.
He ran outta here just before I came in.
Well, I know her.
She's the mayor's secretary.
They say it was a stroke.
It's all that damn smoking.
I'm tellin' ya.
- Look, Hazel I have a lot of work to do.
- It's a shame, shame.
- I have a lot of work to do Hazel.
- [Hazel] All right, I'm goin', I'm goin'.
- And some of these tribes use this as a rite of passage into the next world.
- [David] Um, excuse me, Miss Hayes.
- [Pam] Yes, David.
- Yes, did they really, you know?
(laughing)
- You mean did they ejaculate?
Yes.
They believed that by ejaculating into the corpse, the man could take his seed into the next world, in case he dies in battle with rival tribes, and never had the opportunity to father children.
- That's sick.
- Miss Hayes?
- Kris?
- What if no one volunteers for this great honor?
What if nobody dies?
- Well, in that case they'd have to have a sacrifice.
- But that's murder, right?
I mean, come on, they kill somebody.
- Yes, murder to us, but to them it was a religious ritual, and integral part of their culture.
- Does it still go on?
- Yes, in some of the occults groups we read about today.
- But you mean in Africa and Haiti, voodoo and stuff like that.
- It's a surprising fact that according to statistics, more cases of necrophilia were reported in the United States than anywhere else in the world.
Well, that's all the time we have today class.
- Wait for me outside.
(class chattering)
- Miss Hayes?
- Nicolas.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
- It's all right, what can I do for you?
- Could we talk just a little bit more about today's subject?
- Oh, gee, I'm really sorry.
I'm in a bit of a rush.
- Please.
Just a couple of minutes.
I really need to talk to someone.
It's kinda personal.
- Personal?
- It's about this.
- Necrophilia?
- Yeah, I think so.
- You think so?
Nick, what are you talking about?
- Could you meet me tonight?
- Nick I'm really flattered, and I must admit that was a novel approach, but uh, I'm sorry.
- Miss Hayes, I'm serious.
I think I have something interesting to show you.
- Nick, again, I'm sorry, but I can't tonight.
- All right, if you change your mind let me know.
- Where'd you wanna take me?
- My Uncle's funeral home.
(laughing)
- You know, that's not the best offer
I've had in a long time.
If I change my mind I'll let you know.
_ okay-
Good bye.
(laughing)
(grunting)
- I thought you said you were only gonna be a couple of minutes?
- Sorry Angie, I had something to discuss with Miss Hayes.
- I'll bet.
- Come on, I'll take you home.
- Wait a minute.
I'm not going anywhere unless you tell me what could be so personal that you could tell Miss Hayes but you can't tell me.
- Drop it Angela, all right.
I told you, it has nothing to do with us.
It was a personal thing, all right.
- Nick!
When's it gonna get personal between you and me?
I mean, I don't even know when the last time we made love is.
- Angela drop it, all right.
I haven't got time for this.
If you're so unhappy with me, find someone else.
(sobbing)
- Don't be afraid.
I'll be with you soon.
(chilling music)
- So I'm just getting into necrophilia in my anthropology course.
- Necrophilia?
- Yeah.
(moans with disgust)
What?
- ls that mandatory?
- No, it is not mandatory.
But I like to cover everything.
May I finish?
- [Mandy] Yes, go ahead.
- Thank you.
So I have this one student, Nick Leonard.
I don't know, you know him?
- Yeah, nice buns.
- That's him.
(giggling)
He comes to me after class and he tells me he'd like to show me something relative to the subject.
Guess where he wanted to take me?
- [Blond Woman] Where?
- To his uncle's funeral home.
- Sounds pretty kinky.
- Not quite my speed.
- Look Pam, do yourself a favor.
Don't give these guys any weird ideas.
They're already crazy enough.
- You are absolutely right.
Well, I am going to go put myself into some sweetness.
(rock music)
(crickets chirping)
(upbeat music)
(heavy breathing)
(crickets chirping)
(phone ringing)
(sighing)
Hello.
- Miss Hayes?
' [Pam] Yes.
- Hi, it's Nicky.
Nick Leonard.
Look, I'm sorry to call you at home, but I must see you.
- Oh look, Nicky, I'm right in the middle of something.
Can this wait 'til class?
- No, it's just really important that I meet you tonight.
- Nick, look.
I'm really flattered, but I, I don't think we ought to go out of the bounds of the student-teacher relationship.
You know, and besides, I am seeing somebody.
- No, it's nothing like that.
It's just that, well, what I'm talking about...
Look, you gotta see it for yourself or you're never gonna believe me.
- [Pam] Look, Nick.
- Please, you gotta trust me.
Just give me 10 minutes.
I'm begging you.
- [Pam] Better not be some sort of fraternity joke.
- This is no joke.
Meet me at my uncle's funeral home in 20 minutes.
- [Pam] Okay.
- Oh, and Miss Hayes.
' [Pam] Yes.
- The address is 242 Lamont Avenue.
Thanks Miss Hayes.
(eerie music)
(muffled screaming)
(chanfing) (muffled moaning)
(sighing)
Thanks for coming Miss Hayes.
I really appreciate it.
We'd better hurry.
- Hey, don't rush me.
I'm gonna tell you again, this better not be a joke.
- This is no joke.
Come on, he'll be back soon.
We'd better hurry.
- So what?
Hey Nick, this, you know, you're not gonna do something crazy?
- No, but he is.
- What do you mean?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Be quiet, I don't wanna wake up my aunt.
- All right.
(foreboding music)
Nick, where the hell we going now?
My uncle's laboratory
- But be quiet.
- Great, just great.
- Wait here.
- Wait here?
Oh great.
Nicolas, where are you going?
Nicolas!
(chilling music)
- Damn, he must've put the body in the coffin.
It must be upstairs.
- Oh thank God for that, now let's get the hell out of here.
I don't know why I let you talk me into this in the first place.
- No wait, look, I know you think I'm nuts, but I can prove it.
- Prove what?
He's an Undertaker.
Now, let's get the hell out of here.
(foreboding music)
Nick!
Nicolas.
What are you looking for now?
- The photographs, but I can't find them.
- Roscoe, is that you?
What are you doing working there so late?
- Damn, that's my aunt.
Oh my God, if she tells him.
Come on.
- [Hazel] Damn neighbors changing everyday.
Now they're trying to rob the dead.
- Come on.
- [Hazel] Nothing's sacred, nothing's sacred.
(eerie music) (chanfing)
(muffled screaming)
(eerie music)
- Pretty gory, huh?
- Yeah.
- [Man In Blue] Well you must really like this movie, sir.
How many times have you seen it?
- Moron.
- Asshole.
(heels clicking)
(heavy breathing)
(foreboding music)
(horn honking)
- [Man] I know, I'm late again.
- [Woman] You're always late, Billy.
You made me go to the movies by myself, and then you pick me up late, it's not fair.
- [Man] I know, I know.
I promise it won't happen again.
- [Woman] You've been saying that for how long now?
(engine humming)
(heavy breathing)
- [Mrs. Hudson] Thanks Nancy.
Sorry to call you on such short notice.
- [Nancy] It's all right, Mrs. Hudson.
- Oh, and I'll probably need you next week too.
- [Nancy] I'm available.
- [Mrs. Hudson] Now you sure you don't need a ride home?
- I'm sure.
Thank you.
- [Mrs. Hudson] Good night, Nancy.
- Good night.
(chilling music)
(suspenseful music)
(screaming)
(muffled screaming)
- I don't know why you're crying, I learned this tonight.
(muffled screaming)
(screaming)
(intestines squishing)
(Roscoe sobbing)
You don't know what it's like to never have a body warm and soft.
Like in the movie.
Sleep my love, sleep.
J1 Rock-A-Bye baby flOn
(eerie music)
- [Young Nicky] No, Uncle Roscoe.
I don't want to.
(Roscoe laughing)
No.
I don't want to.
No, Uncle Roscoe.
(Roscoe laughing)
- You bastard.
You sick fucking bastard.
(crickets chirping)
(foreboding music)
- Oh Nicky, can I be of some assistance to you my dear boy?
- You sick bastard.
You sick fucking perverted bastard.
- Sick and perverted, Nicolas.
This is your uncle.
Since your mother died, and your so-called father left you,
I sent you to school, I remind you, Nicolas.
I'm surprised at you.
- Miss Hayes said in school today that people like you should be put away.
- Miss Hayes?
Some slut?
You'd take some sluts word over your uncle, who loves you?
Nicolas, you're breaking my--
- Loved me?
- Yes.
- You never loved me.
- Yes I do.
You're breaking my heart.
- I'll kill you for what you did.
- Really?
- I'll kill you for what you did!
- Do you know about pressure points Nicolas?
(dramatic music) (groaning)
(thudding)
on, Nicky.
Nicolas, you've been a very big disappointment to me.
But there's someone I want you to meet.
It's your Aunt Nancy.
She's precious, isn't she?
Look at her Nicolas, look at her.
Don't worry, Nick.
She'll be joining you on that long journey.
I'm just going to put you to sleep.
Don't be afraid.
Calm yourself.
Do you think Uncle Roscoe would hurt you Nicholas?
I love you.
(children chattering)
(groaning)
- What is this?
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God!
(retching)
- Have you seen Nick Leonard today?
- No, but that's not unusual.
I don't have him in any of my classes this year.
- Hm, he didn't show up for mine, and he never misses.
- What do you have the hots for this guy or something?
- You have got a one-track mind.
- Why, thank you.
- I am just a little concerned after last night.
I think it's a little weird, you know.
Uh, I gotta go, it's late.
I'll see ya later.
- See ya later.
- Mary Lawrence who disappears about a week ago.
Or the Bowen kid, who disappears last night.
- Too much of a coincidence, right?
- Well, what's our next move, Chief?
- I don't know what the hell we got going on here.
We better call in the state police.
_ okay-
- Let's go.
- All right.
Hang in there, okay.
You'll be all right, alright?
You hang in there.
- So, you think there's some connection between this and the disappearance of the two girls?
- Look, the Bowen girl was as reliable as the sunrise.
And the other kid, Mary Lawrence, not the type to just take off.
- Well the coroner can pinpoint age, sex, method, blood type.
If what you found belongs to one of those two girls, we'll know soon enough.
- So, we can assume we're dealing with a psycho.
Probably a drifter.
- Nah, no 'cause a drifter wouldn't stay long.
You know, he's too noticeable in a small town like this.
And those disappearances were a week apart.
How 'bout a college kid?
- Ain't never had any trouble with 'em before.
They can't even drink here.
This town's dry.
- Well, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.
Let's see what the coroner has to say.
- I got the paperwork all cleared up.
- This whacko is following this picture scene by scene.
This movie's his MO.
- You gonna start using that police jargon again?
If you wanted to be a cop you should've taken the test.
- Hey look Louise, you think just because
I'm a security guard, it means I can't solve a crime?
I can't make arrests?
- Listen Sherlock, I've got work to do.
- Oh come on Louise, take a look at it.
Let's just look at the murder scene.
One, we got a gruesome murder.
Blood scattered everywhere.
There are pieces of guts and intestines laying scattered about.
- Listen, ljust, ljust ate.
Why don't you go talk to the projectionist, okay?
I'm sure he's seen it more times than you.
- Oh now, Louise, I always thought you were brighter than the rest of these hicks.
I mean, let's look, even the missing bodies are in here.
And let me tell ya something Louise, this guy's been in this theater, and he's seen this picture five or six times.
And you know what?
He's coming back.
- Roscoe dear, it was a beautiful funeral you did, you know.
You made it look so peaceful.
- Thank you, Hazel.
- And the mayor and his wife both commented how natural she looked.
- Good.
- You know, just the other day I was thinking how the neighborhood has changed, you know, with the scene in the park, and those kids trying to break in.
- What kids, break in where Hazel?
- Well, it slipped my mind.
- What, what are you are you talking about Hazel?
- I remember now.
I heard voices coming from your laboratory, and I went there, and I thought it was you.
But as I turned on the light,
I saw this young woman running out the back door.
- [Roscoe] Did you call the police, Hazel?
- No I didn't.
Nothing was missing.
You think I should have?
(dramatic music)
(phone ringing)
- Hello.
Administration, Mrs. Thomas speaking.
Yes, Chief, sorry.
How can I help you?
Yes, I know it's here somewhere.
Bear with me.
I found it, Chief.
Let's see.
Oh that's Hayes.
H-A-Y-E-S, right Chief?
Pamela Hayes.
165 Clermont Avenue.
- 165 Clermont.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
You moron.
Angela, how ya doin'?
- Hi, Mr. Holland.
Is Nicky here?
- No, the last time I saw him he was with you.
- I haven't seen him since yesterday.
- Mm-hm.
- We had a fight.
He's not at his apartment.
- Did you go there?
Did you call him?
- Yeah.
- Well don't worry about it.
We've always been very high-strung in the family, but I'm sure that when I see him
I can get you kids back together again.
- Thank you.
Will you have him call me?
- I certainly will.
(gentle music)
(foreboding music)
(gentle music)
(foreboding music)
- [Woman] Damn.
(heavy breathing) (foreboding music)
Where are those matches?
(chilling music)
(screams)
(groaning)
- [Woman] Hey Pam, you wanna grab those paper towels in the back seat of the car?
- [Pam] Yeah, I got 'em.
(foreboding music) (heavy breathing)
- Well naturally I thought there was some kind of connection between necrophilia and his uncle.
God, I hope he calls me tomorrow.
My curiosity is driving me crazy.
- Well, you think we should call the police?
- And tell them what?
We don't have any proof of anything.
I'm not even sure if Nick was involved.
- Look we'll talk about it tomorrow.
I'll see you in the morning, okay?
- Yeah, night Man.
(heavy breathing)
(foreboding music)
(shower running)
(phone ringing)
(suspenseful music)
(screams)
- Did you hear the phone?
- Jesus Christ, you scared the hell outta me.
- It's your mom.
- I'll be right there.
- [Roscoe] Next time, Miss Hayes.
Next time.
(suspenseful music)
- Hey, come in Joe!
- How ya doin', Doc?
Said you had something to show me.
- This is one for the books, my friend.
- What makes this one so different?
- The bits of tissue I examined, are those of a woman between the ages 15 to 20 years of age.
As you probably know, the person stops bleeding when the heart stops.
Now, judging by the way the blood coagulated, the girl was alive when she was disemboweled.
- Son of a bitch.
- It get worse.
- Worse?
- Aspetta, it get worse.
There are traces of semen on the intestine tissue.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
Well I'll get this down to them now and, will you do me a favor, Doc?
- What's a matter, Joe?
- Would you get rid of the jacket.
I'm dying with the heat.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
In this job you get used to everything!
- It's all your fault Nicolas.
All your fault!
Well you'll just have to wait my dear boy.
But not you, my sweet.
I found a suitable companion for your safe journey.
Don't worry.
You know, I'm quite harmless.
(laughing)
(Spits)
(laughing)
(kids chattering)
(heavy breathing)
- That's it.
This ain't my idea of fun excercise.
- Oh, I'm so glad you said that.
- I quit.
I'm dying of thirst.
Let's get you some water.
(heavy breathing)
Oh Christ.
Look at him, Tarzan of the Apes.
- Does he have that kind of energy where it counts?
- Oh, and then some.
MWah!
- You know Professor Wilson, even when I was your student, I never liked you.
- She said it's not unusual for guys Nick's age to take off like that.
- You don't buy that, do you?
- Sure don't.
- So, why don't you call the police?
- And tell them what?
That I think Nick's uncle may have done something to him, because he showed me his laboratory?
Oh yeah right.
I can see them coming to arrest me now.
- Well if you're not gonna call the police then why don't you just forget about it?
- You know, you are really amazing.
Can't you see that there just might be some connection between all these girls that are disappearing in town and Nick?
And what about Mrs. Pavelock, huh?
Next door for Christ's sake?
Did it ever occur to you, just occur to you, that Nick just might be telling the truth about his uncle, huh?
- Well then call the fucking police already?
Why don't you make up your mind?
- All right, drop it.
Here comes Kevin.
- What, quitters?
No pain, no gain.
Hey, where's Stan?
I thought he was joining us.
- 50W)'-
Stan's forte is indoor sports.
- Hey, you guys are coming to dinner with us tonight, aren't you?
- No, we can't.
Stan's working late tonight.
I'm gonna meet him later at his apartment.
But you guys will survive without us, right?
- Oh, I think we will survive.
- And if we don't, what a way to go.
(lips smacking)
(laughing)
- You didn't get the windshield.
- [Attendant] Sorry Mr. Holland, I'll get it now.
- [Roscoe] Moron.
- Moron.
Asshole.
(dramatic music)
Let's see where you go.
(dramatic music)
Very clever Mr. Holland, very clever.
Who else would have an easier time getting rid of bodies?
(laughing)
Christ, I'll be the biggest thing to hit this town since...
I need proof, proof.
Oh, and what an invitation.
Look at this.
A funeral.
- Bunch of hypocrites.
- Oh now Roscoe, why would you say that?
- Are you kidding, Hazel?
Sorry for your gain.
They always hated the bastard.
- What a sense of humor you have, Roscoe.
- I know, Hazel.
(chilling music)
Well, can I help you, young man?
- Oh no, I'm fine.
I guess I'm a little bit shaken up over the death of my friend.
- I can understand that.
Would you like to sit for a while?
- No, I'm fine.
It seems like my wife is a little bit late.
You know, I really hate these things.
- I can understand, but unfortunately it's one of life's realities.
I'm sure that you would be more comfortable if you came inside.
Much cooler, we have air conditioning.
- Oh no, I'm fine.
Just stay out here, until my wife arrives.
- Well then you wouldn't mind if I went back inside.
I have a lot of people waiting for me.
Thank you and God bless you, son.
(chuckling)
- Roscoe, dear, is that young man all right?
- Yes Hazel, he became quite ill.
He had to leave.
- Well, perhaps he'll feel better tomorrow.
- I'm sure he will.
- All right.
- Mary Lawrence disappears.
No sign of foul play.
- And a good kid.
- And the Bowen kid, Nancy.
Disappears a few blocks from her home.
Somebody give her a ride?
- Well according to Mrs. Hudson, she declined a ride with her.
Now of course she could've been picked up by a school chum butnah,nah.
All her classmates were at home at the time.
Ichecked.
- Someone knew she was babysitting.
Waiting for her?
- Or she was the victim of opportunity.
Some guy comes cruising along, late at night.
She's a girl, walking alone.
He's gotta be one sick bastard to do what he did to that kid.
- I'll tell ya something else that's bothering me.
- [Chief] Yeah, what?
- Mrs. Pavelock.
Blood splattered all over the inside of her home.
Now we either have too many acts on our hands, or this guy's changed his pattern.
- Excuse me.
Yeah, Chief Banes.
- No, it's gotta be the same guy.
Because he's still taking away the bodies.
Where are the bodies?
- Could be he's branching' out.
Just got a call from a gal who's boyfriend is missing since Wednesday.
College kid, name's Nick Leonard.
- Wednesday.
Same night the Bowen kid disappeared.
- [Chief] Yeah, same night as the Bowen kid.
- Hey, come on Louise, can you hurry it up?
- What's up with you?
You gotta hot date or something?
- No, I got some important things to do, so if you wouldn't mind.
_ I'm going.
- Good bye, Louise.
- Yeah, good night.
(distant metallic clanging)
(eerie music)
- What the fuck you trying to do?
- I only wanted some change for cigarettes, man.
- You know you could've gotten yourself killed.
Now get outta here.
(chilling music)
(suspenseful music)
(engine revving)
(hammer clicks)
Tonight I show these small town hicks what a real detective is.
And Mr. Holland you're gonna help me.
(screaming)
(laughing)
(groaning)
- I know, I know Jenny, but...
You must be patient.
(groans)
(grunting)
I've been very, very busy.
Nicolas.
Nicolas.
Oh, Nicolas
(gentle music)
- Come on baby, wanna talk about it?
- Oh, ljust can't get this off my mind.
Poor Jenny next door.
I'm really worried.
- Maybe Mandy was right.
Maybe we should call the police.
That's what they're there for.
- And what if we're wrong.
What if there's no connection.
- Isn't that what you really wanna know?
- Yeah.
You're right.
I love you.
- I love you.
- [Mandy] Listen, listen, I'm gonna call her.
- [Stan] Call her tomorrow, she's with Kevin.
- Look I gotta call her tonight, or else I gotta go home.
- All right, give her a call.
_ okay-
(phone ringing)
Pam.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- Mandy, what do you want?
- Everything I can get. (laughs)
- You better believe it.
- Yeah, sounds like I'm the one that's interrupting you.
What's up?
- Well, if you really wanna know.
- Mandy, why did you call?
- Well I guess I was just a little worried about this thing with you and Nicolas.
- Who's Nicolas?
- Shh!
- Well I think you'll really be proud of me.
I finally made a decision to call the police.
- Yeah, you did?
That's really great.
So I guess you won't miss me if I don't come home 'til tomorrow, huh?
- I'll see you when I see you.
Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, bye-
You better be ready to finish me, stud.
(moaning)
- [Hazel] Roscoe dear, here's your tea and biscuits.
- Oh, thanks Hazel.
- You know Mrs. Harrah called.
She said they'll be delivering Mr. Harrah today.
- Who is he?
- Oh, you remember him.
Ah, you know, he was the one you used to laugh at because his name is the same frontwards and backwards.
And you know, she said you should put his hairpieoe on, or his friends won't recognize him.
- Look Hazel, I would appreciate if,
I have a lot of work to do, if you'd just leave me alone for a bit.
- All right dear, I'll go upstairs and do what I have to do, I have work too.
- Good.
- Okay dear, take care of yourself.
I have work to do.
(sighs)
- Yes, that's right.
163 Clermont.
Thanks Inspector.
They'll be here in 15 minutes.
- I heard.
- Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
- Yeah, I mean, at least it'll be out of your hands.
You got nothing to lose.
- Nothing to lose but my credibility as a teacher.
- They'll keep it confidential.
- Honey, not in this town.
(dramatic music)
- Thanks again, Miss Hayes.
We'll look into it right away.
Let you know if it amounts to anything, all right?
- Thank you.
- By the way, how do we find this place?
- Make a left at the light and a right two lights down.
- Thank you, you've been very helpful.
How well did you know Mrs. Pavelock?
- We had a nodding acquaintance.
We said hello when we saw her.
- Thank you.
(kids chattering) (dog barking)
- Pavelock, coincidence or mistake?
- Could be.
- She teaches these kids about necrophilia in an anthropology course and then gets spooked by it herself.
Unless she unwittingly triggered some sick mind into doing all this.
- You think it's this kid, Leonard?
- I'll tell you what I think, partner,
I think she is one lucky lady.
And if the aunt didn't come along when she did,
I think we'd be looking for our Miss Hayes right about now.
(engine revs)
- [Hazel] Roscoe dear.
- What is it, Hazel.
- Two nice gentlemen friends to see you.
- Would you come in?
Please be seated.
You have my ear.
Sincere condolences, a loved one has passed?
- Oh no sir, nothing like that.
We'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
- Hazel.
- Would your gentlemen friends like some tea?
- No thank you ma'am, we won't be long.
- Well then I'll be leaving now, dear Roscoe.
- Thanks, Hazel.
I guess you're here about Nicky, right?
- That's right, son.
Police officers and we've been lead to believe that you know about your nephew's whereabouts.
- Well I guess you'll find out sooner or later, so I might as well tell you now.
- Find out what son?
- About Nicolas.
- I promised I would be silent, but I guess I should tell you.
He was helping to dig and, he's just a kid, but what he did to these bodies.
It was incredible.
- That's why he brought her here that night.
- He came to me and he told me, he begged me for some money, you know.
He said it was an accident.
(sobbing)
It was no accident.
I found out the next day it wasn't an accident.
- I'll get on the radio and get an APB out on this guy right now Bobby.
- He was my dearly departed sister's only son, and I just couldn't tell anybody.
What was I supposed to do, oh God.
- [Inspector] Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
Wait, is Hazel out there?
- [Inspector] No, we're alone here, Mr. Holland.
- Okay, I don't want her to know.
Thank you, Officer.
Poor Nick, you know.
He didn't mean it.
He was...
He was abused when he was a kid.
And what he did to these poor, oh Momma.
- Please calm down, sir.
- You won't hang Nicky if you find him, will you?
- Where does that door lead, sir?
- That's uh, my laboratory.
- Do you mind if we take a look?
- Certainly not.
I'll show you.
Oh Nicky...
Officer Barry.
This is the laboratory.
- Where does that door lead, Mr. Holland?
- Through the courtyard, Officer.
- And this one here?
- Hall, the hallway.
- And this one over here, sir?
- Oh, uh, that's the storage closet.
I'll get the key, it's not open, Officer.
(suspenseful tones)
- It's open, Sir.
- Oh, is it?
- I though you said this was a storage closet.
- It's Nick.
It's not, it's a storage cellar.
- Mind if I go down?
- No, not at all.
(thudding)
(maniacal laughing)
Nicky, there's some gentlemen here to see you.
I'll be right back.
(maniacal laughing)
Officer Barry's in the washroom, would you like some tea?
- Oh, uh, no, no, it's fine.
- A cold beverage perhaps?
- Yeah, something diet'd be nice.
- Hm, okay.
(suspenseful music)
(gurgling)
- No, I don't feel like making dinner tonight.
- [Mandy] I'm leaving Stan's house in a few minutes.
I'll bring a pizza.
- No, don't.
I wanna go down and try to speak to Nick's aunt.
- Are you crazy?
What if his uncle is there?
- Look, the police never called me back, like they said they would.
They probably never even went down there.
I've gotta find out.
- Just wait for me.
I'm going with you, okay?
(foreboding music)
Fuck this.
- No, I'm at the hospital.
I just, I was on my way out, and I couldn't wait for these cops anymore to tell me what was going on with this guy, Nick, so I just thought I would go over there
and check it out for myself and this guy ran a stop, it wasn't my fault.
He ran the stop sign.
All right, listen, can you just pick me up here?
All right that'd be great.
I guess I'll wait outside.
Bye.
- Dr. Jorgenson report to emergency stat.
(foreboding music)
- Pam!
Son of a bitch.
Pam.
I gotta be outta my fucking mind.
What am I doing here?
- Looking into my parlor there's a spider and a fly.
(screaming) (maniacal laughing)
- Oh no!
(screams) ahuds)
- Thanks for the tea.
And for coming to pick me up.
- Don't mention it.
- You know that accident was probably a sign telling me to stay home and mind my own business.
- By the way, where's Mandy?
- I don't know, should be here by now.
- Maybe she went to pick up some chow?
- Oh yeah, she did mention something about pizza.
(moaning)
- I told you gentlemen, your patience shall be rewarded.
It's show time.
(maniacal laughing)
Look what I've got.
It's marvelous.
Comes in very handy.
(moaning)
Do I hear a plea?
Are you begging for mercy?
Is that drama?
(muffled screaming)
Present.
As I end my refrain,
I press down.
(muffled screaming)
What?
N0 applause?
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
You don't seem to be their cup of tea.
Perhaps Pamela would be.
Well, my dear, I guess that's show biz.
(screaming)
(maniacal laughing)
(eerie music)
Well, hello Miss Hayes.
Mandy, you've been a great deal of help to me.
Oh Nicky,
we're going to meet Miss Hayes.
(soft, romantic music)
(heavy breathing)
Business hasn't been good lately.
What with these, all these vitamins that people are taking, and the Surgeon General's warning about smoking, the silly driving without drinking laws,
I haven't been able to ship you out that fast.
I guess I'll have to drum up some business.
- Pam.
You awake?
(moaning)
Come on, you're not going to sleep on me, are you?
- Mm, let me sleep.
- Come on, I got a great idea.
I'll be right back.
(cheerfully humming)
(suspenseful music)
(glass shattering)
- Kevin!
(laughing)
Kevin, you clutz, what did you break now?
Kevin.
(gasps)
(screaming)
- You bitch.
(screaming)
(glass shatters)
(screaming)
(sobbing)
You ought to run.
Indeed.
(maniacal laughing)
(screaming)
Nicky.
(laughing)
(screaming)
(groans)
Soon you'll be joining all your friends, my darling.
But first there's a little service you must perform.
A gesture, you might say, for the problems you caused Nicolas and me.
(moaning)
N, N, very good.
I,
c, very good,
K-
Now I forgive you.
(laughing)
Now I forgive you!
(laughing)
(banging)
(thudding)
-[Chiefl Break it in.
- God damn.
- Oh God.
(chilling music)
- As I promised you gentlemen, you'll all have travelling companions.
And you lovely, Mandy,
will be back with Pamela again.
(screaming)
(moaning)
(haunting music)
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Woods, refill, please.
Yeah, sure.
Whatever you want.
Hey, hey, hey.
Why so down in the mouth there, bud?
Well, I'm understudying another play, and I know I'm never gonna get to go on, because the star never gets sick.
But, darn it, the part is perfect for me.
Yeah?
What is that part?
Moses.
My theater group is doing an original play,
An Evening With the Prophets.
Mm.
I got more lines than any of the other Israelites.
( chuckles )
But I managed to jam them all in, right up here.
Mm.
Yeah, your head looks packed, all right.
Go on, test me.
Give me a cue.
All right.
( muttering )
Well, what's the first line?
"And I have said I will bring you up
"out of the affliction of Egypt
"under the land of the Canaanites
"and the Hittites, and the Amorites
"and the Parasites, and the Hivites."
Wait, wait, wa-wa-wait.
What, uh, what happened to the Cellulites?
NORM:
They, uh, settled in the land of Vera.
( laughing ):
Did you hear what he said?
( piano plays )
¶ Making your way in the world today ¶
¶ Takes everything you've got

¶ Wouldn't you like to get away?

Thank you.
Boy, what a day.
Yeah?
Yeah, I can't wait for it to end.
All I can think about is getting home and jumping into bed.
Need anybody to break your fall?
Hi.
Sam Malone.
Hi.
Suzanne Porter.
How do you do?
Sam, you done picking up on this lady?
( clears throat )
Not quite, Woody.
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but, uh,
Denise called.
Oh, Denise.
Who's Denise?
Um... uh, my brother's kid.
Uh, Denise.
Yeah, I have to say hi to her, and De-nephew.
( both laughing )
Very smooth, Sam.
Very funny.
Uh, so who's this Denise?
Aw, she was somebody... we had quite a thing going there a while ago.
And then we both realized that sex wasn't anything to base a relationship on, so... six months later, we broke up.
NORM:
Uh-huh.
Yeah, she must be quite a dish if you're willing to pass up on door number one over there.
Well, it's kind of like avocados.
One of them's ripe, and ready to be squashed into guacamole.
And the other one needs to stay on the shelf a little while longer.
( both laughing ) WOODY:
Well, anyway, call her back-- she says it's urgent.
Ah, with the accent on "urge," huh?
Hmm!
Actually, you know, I think, uh, this is a call I should return in person.
Aw, Sam!
Whoa, hey!
Where are you going?
Uh, to my niece's house.
Her grandma's sick.
If it's your niece's grandma, wouldn't that be your mother?
My mom's sick?
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
Why don't you stick around for a little while?
My mom bounces right back.
Hey, Sam, hey, uh, back from the Denise decathlon, huh?
( Cliff chuckles )
Got a, uh, another gold medal in the "broad" jump?
You know, you got a big mouth, Clavin.
Hey, he happens to be right, you know.
Yeah, it's a genetic quirk in the, uh, Clavin family that we all have two extra teeth.
Yeah, you see, that's the only way that we can prove that we are the rightful heirs to the Russian throne.
Hello in there, Cliff.
Tell me... what color is the sky in your world?
What's wrong?
Carla, I just want to be left alone for a while, all right?
You got it.
Thank you.
Hey, everybody, Sam wants to be left alone!
Okay, Sammy, spill your guts.
What's the matter?
Carla, I just said that I-I want...
Yeah, but you're gonna end up telling me eventually, so you might as well get it over with.
Go on, make you feel better.
Just keep this to yourself.
Remember how I went over to Denise's house?
Well, she... she didn't invite me over for a good time.
She wanted to show me something.
What?
My child.
Seven pounds, ten ounces, a baby boy.
( laughs )
( laughing continues )
What's so funny?
( laughing continues )
Sam Malone finally got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
( laughs )
Carla, come on.
This is serious.
Oh, of course it is, Sam.
But I really think you're gonna be okay, you know?
Yeah?
Just remember this.
This little piggy went to market... ( laughing )
Would you...?
This is not funny.
I'm sorry.
You sure it's yours?
No, it's between me and another guy.
But the kid's a real looker, so, you know, you figure it out.
So when are you gonna find out, Dad?
Soon.
I mean, she dragged me down to a lab to have a blood test.
Well, what's the big deal, you know?
You can just do what all the other jerks do.
You pay a little money for support, and you get off the hook.
No, Carla, it means a lot more to me than that.
I'm telling you, if this, if this kid is mine, then... then I want to see that he's fed, that he's clothed, and that he's educated.
You know, I'm-I'm gonna take him to, to Little League games, too.
I'm gonna be the best damn father you've ever seen.
Please don't let him be mine!
Oh!
Oh!
I tell you, if I get out of this, I swear to God,
I am through fooling around forever.
Sam, don't swear to God.
No, I mean it, I mean it, if I get out of this,
I swear to God, I'll never have sex again.
You?
Never?
Yeah, not ever.
I mean, for the rest...
Well, three months, three months.
Well, I guess the amount of sex you have in three months is what most people have in a lifetime.
Huh.
If they're attractive, I guess.
You have a phone call from Denise.
( sighs )
Oh, and Carla, you know that, uh, pitcher of beer you left on your tray?
Some guy from table six came and drank it.
We don't have a table six.
I knew I should have said table five.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Denise.
Um, what'd the doctor say?
Oh, thank God, oh, thank God!
Oh, thank God!
Oh!
Oh, I'm so happy.
Well, I'm so happy for the other guy.
Yeah.
Congratulations, huh?
All right, we-well, I'll call you some other time then, all right?
Bye-bye.
Doctor, Sam?
Uh, yeah, uh,
Denise and I and this, uh, other guy share the same doctor and she just wanted to let me know that he had gotten some new magazines in the waiting room.
You lucky dog!
Must be the Sports Illustrated "SwimsuitIssue."
Say, uh...
Suzanne, uh... what do you say, you want to help me celebrate here?
I'd love to.
Great.
What are we celebrating?
I have no idea, but whatever it is we're overdressed.
( Carla clears throat ):
Sam?
Yeah?
Uh, Sam, aren't you forgetting something?
I know, I know, I'm gonna drop by the old drug store.
Don't worry, I learned my lesson.
Could you wait just...?
What?
Does the name "God" ring a bell?
Yeah?
The guy you made a vow to?
Oh.
Yeah, boy, I almost forgot about that.
Uh... it's no big thing.
"No big thing"?
Come on, God's a sport.
People make promises like that all the time, but if God had to collect on all of them,
He wouldn't have any time to create natural wonders like that, for instance.
I'll see you...
Oh, boy.
Give me a minute here.
CARLA:
Listen, Sammy,
I don't want to tell you how to run your life, but I want to tell you this:
don't mess with God.
Look at all the people in the Bible who did.
The entire population of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Lot's wife-- turned into a salt lick with boobs.
Come on, what...
What's He gonna do-- reach down from the clouds and snatch me up?
You know, you...
Halt, infidel!
Hey, sorry, Sam.
Uh, I was just at an understudy rehearsal.
I thought you might get a kick out of my costume.
( panting ):
You ought to warn people before you go around pretending to be God.
You thought I was God?
Thanks.
I was only trying to be Moses.
Hey, guys, he thought I was God!
Sam, can we go now?
Yeah, you bet.
No, no, Sam!
He has sent His messenger.
Me...?
What messenger?
That is just Woody.
You think it's a coincidence that Woody came in just at that very moment dressed as Moses?
I mean, of all the plays he could have been in, Sammy.
He could have been dressed as Auntie Mame.
Would that have scared you?
Yeah, a little.
Let's face it, Sam, that was a warning, and you'd better take heed.
Oh, come on, what's He gonna do?
Well, my cousin Tino...
Yeah?
...swore he'd give up meat.
That night, he ate a burger.
The next day, his teeth fell out.
Oh, come on, Carla.
There's no connection here.
I swore I would not have sex, so... ( shudders )
Listen, I-I-I'm not really in the mood anymore.
Why not?
Carla's cousin Tino's teeth fell out.
Yeah, well, maybe some other time.
Uh...
Why don't you give me a call?
Yeah.
I-I don't have your number.
Perfect.
Oh... are you satisfied, God's Little Helper?
Oh, listen, Sam.
Uh, in the interest of authenticity, you think there's anyway I can sound less like God and more like Moses?
Yeah, stop going around scaring people.
That's good.
That's good, now, how 'bout the voice?
Now sit down.
Now... how can I be of help?
Well, I would like your advice, Father.
Actually, it's for a friend of mine.
He, uh... got himself into kind of a bind, and so, in desperation, promised God he'd give up something.
And what did he promise to give up?
Sweets.
Oh.
I see.
( chuckles )
Yeah... but my friend really likes sweets a lot.
You know, and sweets like him a lot.
And he hasn't had sweets now for about two weeks, and if he doesn't have sweets soon, he's gonna explode.
I see, and God's contractual obligation was to get your friend out of this bind you spoke of.
Yes, sir.
Which He did.
Well, then, what is the problem?
Well, m-my friend was wondering what the penalty would be if he, say... you know, had a... huge box of chocolates.
Sam, I think this is between you and your God.
Yeah, right.
Oh, how did...
How'd you know it was me?
In all the years people have been coming here for their friends, I have never met one of their friends.
Oh, well, yeah, as long as I'm busted,
I guess I might as well tell you the truth here.
I-I didn't promise to give up sweets.
I promised to give up sex.
Ah... that is a tough one.
You know, Sam, the Church does recommend chastity to unmarried people.
( chuckles )
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were serious.
Uh...
How do you do that?
I mean, what do you do?
How do you not?
I mean, a-are there special tricks, or a certain way of sitting, maybe?
Well, yes, but we are strictly forbidden to reveal it.
You're kidding.
Yes.
Oh.
You know, Sam, I think you're looking for someone to tell you it's all right to break your vow, but I can't do that.
You know, I've found that people who come here looking for answers usually know what the answer is, and I think you do, too.
Yeah, maybe.
Well, thank you.
Oh...
Oh, no, no, no.
SAM:
Carla, Carla?
Oh, great.
Look.
I think I got it.
God's gonna have to accept this one.
"With the Lord, one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years is as one day."
So?
So that means
I've been out of action for 21,000 years.
Come on, that's got to be good enough for Him.
You know, Sam, I-I'd like to agree with you--
( sighs ) since you're so pathetic it's annoying-- but no sale.
All right, all right, I still got Deuteronomy here.
Don't look, Sammy.
Temptation at 12:00.
Oh...
Oh...
Oh, God.
Man, they're coming in waves.
( phone ringing )
Cheers.
Yeah, this is him.
You're kidding.
Moses has an ear infection.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.
I'll be right there.
So, Woody, they gonna let you go on?
Uh, no, I got to stop by the drugstore and pick up some antibiotics.
So, believe it or not, I've given up sex entirely.
But you got to promise not to tell anybody.
Well, Sam, confidentiality is the bedrock of my profession.
Besides, who'd believe me?
You were saying?
Well, I was just wondering what you think I ought to do.
Well, you need to find another outlet for your sexual energies.
Mm-hmm.
For example, during six painfully frustrating months of my adolescence,
I built a submarine in our basement.
One of those little plastic models?
No, life-size.
Slept six.
The happiest hours of my youth were spent down there in the dark shouting, "Fire one.
Fire two."
Well, enough about me.
Let's address this problem, Sam.
Well, I don't know anything about submarines.
Well, surely you have other interests.
Sports, sailing, music?
Well, yeah, I had a piano lesson once.
Actually, I had the piano teacher and it was twice, but...
I liked it.
Well, I'll tell you.
If you were to sit down at the piano today and channel your energies into it, you would find all your sexual tensions pouring out through your fingertips.
Yeah, fingertips.
Yeah, right.
And best of all, Sam, no matter how badly you perform, a piano never laughs.
Never stomps out of the room and refuses to let you play again for three days.
Well, I'm off to Lilith.
( yawning ):
Sam?
Would you please lock up?
Uh, yeah.
I'm going home to bed.
Okay, good night.
Did you hear me?
I said I'm going to go to bed.
Well, I hope you, uh, get a good night's sleep.
Thank you.
Carla, I just left myself wide open for one of Sam's sleazy remarks, and nothing.
I mean, not that I want to, but what does it mean when you can't turn on the horniest guy that ever lived?
I am really getting old.
Oh, Rebecca, would you stop being ridiculous?
You're still a young, beautiful, vibrant woman with her whole life ahead of her.
Oh, you're just saying that.
Yes, I am.
I was taught to humor old folks.
Carla, I ca...
I can't take this anymore.
I mean, I tried everything.
I've stopped eating oysters,
I'm taking cold showers,
I even started stuffing ice in my pockets.
I tell you, I'm not going to make it.
Oh, Sammy, buck up.
You only have nine more weeks to go.
I'm talking about tonight.
Guess who?
Uh-oh.
I'll give you a hint.
Vermont ski lodge, a roaring fire, and baby oil.
Uh... could you, uh, be more specific?
Gravity boots.
Oh, Rachel Patterson.
( laughs ) Oh, look...
Hi, Sam, how are you?
Oh, boy.
I tell you, honey, you're the last person in the world I want to see right now.
Nice to see you, too.
Uh...
Listen, I have got an 18-hour layover, and I'm not the least bit sleepy.
How'd you like to help me kill some time?
Listen, what, um...
Actually, I hear, uh, movies are good for that kind of thing.
Why don't you, uh, why don't you take in about two or three right in a row, there?
I know-- smell.
I'm wearing that perfume that always drove you so crazy.
Oh, Devastation, huh?
Uh...
Actually, I got this, uh, this head cold.
Uh, I wouldn't want you to catch it.
Um, I'm sorry, uh... what do you say, some other time, huh?
Well, okay.
Oh, Sam?
Yeah?
A friend of mine snapped this of me on a beach in Ipanema.
I thought you might like a copy.
Oh.
Would you excuse me just for a minute here?
Look at this!
I mean, this is not fair.
I mean, I'm going for it.
It's-it's not like I'm murdering anybody.
I-I'm just going to bring a great deal of pleasure to two people.
So, if in Your, uh, infinite wisdom,
You feel You have to smite me down, then please make it quick and painless.
And if You could give me about three hours,
I'd appreciate it.
Okay.
Sam?
( sniffing )
Devastation.
The hound is loose.
Please, go easy on him.
Sammy, now you've done it.
There's nothing in your future but frogs and locusts.
Why'd you have to go and do it, Sammy?
I didn't do it.
What?
I didn't do it.
We went to the hotel, she got into bed,
I got into bed with her.
Then I was folding up my socks, and I was...
You fold up your socks?
Sure.
I'm not an animal.
Anyway, all of a sudden, for no reason,
I went over and I, and I opened the nightstand drawer.
And there it was, staring right up at me.
The Bible.
Can you imagine that-- a Bible in a hotel room?
So, we... we got out of there real quick, and we got another room, and... there it was again.
I mean, we... we went from hotel to hotel, and it just followed us wherever we went.
Then it dawned on me.
This was a bona fide miracle.
God was speaking to me directly through hotel nightstands.
He works in mysterious ways.
Amen.
Amen.
Excuse me, Sam, but, uh in all the years you played baseball, traveling throughout the country, all the hotel rooms you stayed in, didn't you ever once notice...?
Uh, Frasier, Sam was just telling us about a miracle that affected him very deeply.
Now, what was it that you were noticing?
Well, th-they always put those little strips of paper across the toilets.
Just an observation.
Sammy, I'm so proud of you.
( chuckling ):
Yeah.
If you could hold out last night, you can make it the whole three months.
Sam, I'm late for a party.
Can you help me with this zipper?
Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
Sam...!
Piano.
Piano, Sam.
For God's sake, piano!
Carla?
( playing "Chopsticks" )
[Crying, Whimpering Continues]
[Man, High-pitched Voice] You look so pretty.
Yes, you do.
Don't cry.
This is gonna make you feel so pretty too, just like the belle of the ball.
I promise.
Don't cry.
Yeah!
Be careful now.
[Crying, Whimpering Continue]
Don't hurt her.
Be gentle.
[Whimpering Intensifies]
Oh, this will make her feel better.
[Normal Voice] Now I can take that nasty tape off your pretty mouth.
Oh, yeah.
[High-pitched Voice] You're hurting her!
[Normal Voice] Don't worry.
I can make it feel all better with just one little kiss.
Mr. Cooper?
I'm Burnett.
He's Cooper.
Mr. Burnett.
Yeah.
Mr. Palmo.
Burnett, Cooper.
Which one of you is the legal genius?
I have a law degree.
You can move money legally all around the world?
Advice on international currency and banking laws.
What I'm paid for.
Your friend?
Mr. Cooper is vice president in charge of collections.
You come with good credentials, but, um, I like personal relationships, so you're gonna be my guests for a while until I get to know you.
You'll enjoy yourselves.
There's a party almost every night.
Well, gee, Mr. Palmo, we didn't bring our toothbrushes.
Toothbrushes, tuxedos, companionship.
It's all here.
Well, I guess we could rough it.
This way, gentlemen.
Sweet dreams, angel.
There we go.
Semi-elegant.
I hate the color of my toothbrush.
Want mine?
No.
Mine's the same color.
Well, we've made it into the castle of the king of drug land, and we haven't lost our heads yet.
This is good.
Now all we have to do is wait for our heavy friend who's in court to come and speak to us in code.
Yeah, and ask us if it rains every day in Miami.
Give me a break.
[Knocking] Come in.
Hi.
I see you've got your tuxes and a toothbrush.
You must be the companionship.
Mr. Palmo asked me... to invite you both down to join the party.
My name's Arlene.
[Laughs]
Well, we're party people, Arlene.
It's gonna be a very enjoyable evening.
[Clamoring]
This is the third teenage girl who's turned up strangled, assaulted and pumped full of cocaine.
What kind of monster do we have here?
[Woman] And the dolls and the matching costumes?
What's Vice got to do with it?
You gonna tell us these kids were hookers?
I'm looking at the only whores in this investigation.
You got plenty to keep your readers turned on.
Get off my back.
It's a homicide, Jarell.
Not anymore.
This is Mr. Taggert from the D.A. Office.
The mayor feels that since the bodies have been found saturated with cocaine, that your department could be of some help.
I want you to shake up your beat, Castillo— the dealers, the pushers, the users.
We have an investigation that's taken months to put into place.
Some of my best people are undercover.
They need the support of the rest of the unit.
The mayor feels that the whole city is on the line.
We're not talking a drop in the tourist trade.
I'll see what I can do.
My chef won a free gastronomique in Paris... for the way he prepares this dish.
Well, that's just thrilling, Mr. Palmo, and we've really enjoyed sharing these finer things in life with you these past three days, but, uh, when are we gonna get down to business?
[Gulping]
Cyrus, that's a Château Latour, 1934.
It's meant to be sipped, not gulped like a can of beer.
Well, I wish it was beer.
I mean, this Miami weather's the pits.
I mean, it is hot.
I done sweat through four shirts a day down here, and I'm a Georgia boy.
I am sorry.
I really shouldn't allow him to sit at the same table, but, uh, three times he's taken a bullet meant for me.
Maybe that's why he sweats.
[Clears Throat] Well, you see, we have our own schedule to keep.
We need an answer.
First, though I'm well respected in the business, the, um, decision isn't mine alone.
I have Colombians, Cubans, Haitians, Mexicans, Canadians, a various assortment of native-born Americans to deal with.
A variety of cultural backgrounds, Mr. Burnett, each with its own way of doing business, each very sensitive.
They must all feel... included.
And besides, there's a special problem right now.
A problem?
These cocaine killings.
Not a good image for the business.
Well, while you worry about your public relations problems, my friend and I will go and ponder how much this waste of our time is gonna cost you.
Delicious menu.
Tripe a la mode du Caen.
You know what that is, Cyrus?
Chitlins.
Should make a good old boy from Georgia feel right at home.
Excuse me.
They both got smart mouths.
If they can supply what they say they can, they have a right to be a little arrogant.
So be nice.
'Cause right now, I need them.
[Man] What am I gonna do?
Oh!
Oh, what am I gonna do?
[Sighs] What am I gonna do?
[High-pitched Voice] Don't worry.
You'll find another ballerina as beautiful as I am.
[Normal Voice] All right.
All right.
All right.
You can trash these, Castillo.
That's all we have— perverts, users, psychological profiles.
The complete creep list.
That's not what I need.
It's the coke that's the special angle.
This isn't stepped-on street junk.
The autopsies rate it at 100% pure.
That means this creep had connections.
That puts it in your backyard, Castillo.
You know the big dealers.
Let's make this their problem.
Two of my men could be caught right in the middle.
They're good.
They'll make the right moves.

[Man On TV] The horror of these murders is beyond anything I've reported on... in 15 years of covering the Miami crime beat.
The sexual assault and murder of teenage girls.
A doll left— who knows why— with their bodies.
And then, his special trademark, his comment on the times— cocaine injected into his victims.
The rape and murder of drugged kids.
Whoever this cocaine killer is, he's put together the ultimate American nightmare.
And now, today, he's struck again.
The victim, 16-year-old Lisa Fentress of Coral Gables, was foundjust after dawn.
Let's hope somebody somewhere in South Florida who knows who this killer is—
That doll's so pretty.
I use to have one just like it.
Oh, yeah?
I collect dolls.
Really?
You like dolls, huh?
I got a collection of them at home.
Maybe sometime you could stop by and see.
I can't now.
My mom's gonna be here any second.
I have a phone in my car.
We could call her up.
[Woman] Vicky!
I don't think so.
She's here right now.
I gotta go, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
[High-pitched Voice] Why didn't you just grab her?
I liked her.
[Clamoring] Please, ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention.
The mayor cannot answer questions at this time, but I do have a statement to read.
"The city of Miami has the equivalent of a plague on its hands— an epidemic that has to be dealt with in the most severe way."
[High-pitched Voice] He's calling you a disease.
He's got a lot of nerve, huh?
"...to protect their children, to make it impossible...
"for this so-called 'doll killer' to exist among us.
"I'm giving our police department the greatest possible powers...
"to extend their investigations into every corner of the city.
And I'm sure the people will understand and cooperate."
Are we talking about some sort of martial law?
[Clamoring]
I said there was a disease in our city.
And you don't fight a disease with warnings and Miranda warrants.
Good day.
[Clamoring]
[Sighs] I win again.
You know, they closed down three of Mr. Palmo's nightclubs last night.
And then some guy from the racing commission comes by and quarantines his entire stable.
That's real heat when they start arresting your horses.
I don't think Mr. Palmo found it funny.
Maybe not.
But horses are probably the only animals he's got working for him with brains.
You know, someday, you and me are gonna dance.
Strike up the band, baby.
Cooper, you look fresh.
See if you can hit a longer ball than your friend.
Remember, let him win.
No problem.
[Chattering] [Man Coughing]
[Man] Look, you got no right to have kept me here all night... just because I once had a little problem!
Two convictions for child molesting is not a little problem, Benny.
Oh, hey, listen.
I wouldn't waste coke on a kid if I was gonna snuff her.
I wouldn't do that.
That-That's a waste of serious money.
I would never do that.
Can you tell us what the questioning was about, Mr. Fuentes?
True that your employees have been arrested?
Reverend Beausourire, your church was raided by the police this morning.
Can you say why?
Yeah, I can tell you why.
You want a statement?
I'll give you a statement.
The police have gone crazy.
That's my statement.
I run a legitimate import business.
And this gentlemen is a pastor of a church, a man of God.
What have we to do with these insane murders?
Come on.
Being the head of a voodoo cult group isn't exactly a character reference.
I have two little daughters myself.
You mean you're suspects?
That's it.
No more questions.
So Fuentes and Reverend Beausourire are unhappy.
A rough estimate puts Fuentes's import business at one-tenth pre-Colombian art... and nine-tenths Colombian flake.
And the good reverend's the only church in town that's got a bank in the Bahamas.
All we're gonna get out of this is a lot of suits for harassment.
Let the mayor's office worry about that.
What about Palmo?
He's being squeezed.
Yeah, but not face-to-face.
If your boys are with Palmo, it's gonna look a little strange if we pass him over.
I'll take care of that.
[Chattering, Laughing]
[High-pitched Voice] Look at them.
Their skins all flushed.
Physical exercise.
Yeah!
I love to see them sweat.
I love it.
It's so physical.
I love it.
That's no way to treat a lady.
You gonna let a couple of cops scare you away?
[Muffled Talking]
[Normal Voice] Don't worry.
We'll come back.
Look, Fuentes, they've been hitting my places too.
They don't think we have anything to do with these girls turning up dead.
We're symbols.
Yeah, symbols.
That's right, Fuentes.
Like fall guys.
Why haven't they picked me up yet, Fuentes?
[Footsteps Approaching]
They just walked in the door.
You make the arrangements.
I'll be a little busy.
Castillo, isn't it?
I think we had an unpleasant conversation about a year ago.
We're about to have another one.
You got a warrant?
I don't think they'd impress an attorney.
When you call one, tell him that your yacht's been impounded.
I hope it's not damaged when they strip it.
Why hit us, Castillo?
Some girls go out looking for a good time.
They want to get high, run into some weirdo.
That's street stuff.
The girls had no drug record.
The cocaine was almost pure— kind of stuff you and your friends like to bring in.
We're businessmen.
We don't knock off teenagers for kicks.
No, just for profit.
[Normal Voice] There's nothing happening here, sweetheart.
Let's go back to the school.
Maybe— Maybe we'll just cruise around and find a nice new friend to play with.
[Ringing] [High-pitched Voice] Don't answer it.
Don't answer it!
What?
Yeah.
This man sure does love his exercise.
All right.
We gotta get outta here.
If our contact doesn't show soon, the only rain in Miami is gonna be on our parade.
I don't think it's ever gonna rain in Miami again.
Look, they're shaking things up downtown, right?
They want to catch the killer.
Figure they push Palmo, he might help.
So we push too.
We'll make him think we're running out on the deal.
We gotta make it look good, so let's be serious.
Trust you gentlemen are enjoying yourselves?
Oh, yes, Mr. Palmo.
But, uh, listen.
Thanks for the nice toothbrush, but we—we gotta be leaving.
Really?
Yeah, and since you've been such a generous host, we won't even charge you for the wasted time.
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
What's the point in keepin' us here?
You're out of business.
Temporary problem.
It'll be solved.
How?
You'll see... tonight.
Well, so much for that.
My friends, these gentlemen with me, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Cooper, are a perfect example of what I've been talking about.
They're businessmen whose expertise could be profitable to all of us.
But they've been made to feel uncomfortable by the situation we find ourselves in.
As long as this scum, this killer of young girls is loose, we will be persecuted by the police with the public's blessings,
even though we, as fathers, as men, want him stopped as much as they do.
We need the law's protection like every other citizen.
Maybe more.
So, as of now, the business is to find this scum.
Everything else— petty feuds, shipments, deals— shuts down till he's off the street.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Done.
Yeah.
Agreed.
Let's get him.
[Rock]
This makes me sick.
I'm gonna go for a drive.
How hard do we come down?
Whatever it takes.
They're all dead anyway.
[High-pitched Voice, Normal Voice] I'm scared.
We're going home.
[ManSingingRock]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Continues]
[No Audible Dialogue]
Well, look who's there.
Who is he?
Name's Benny.
Hold it here, Lefty.
Benny the flasher.
He's one of the first the cops would've picked up.
Well, let's see what he has to say to us.
Sounds like fun.
Hi, Sammy.
Can I have my key?
Thanks.
How you doing today?
I'm doing okay too.
How you doin', Benny?
[Shouts]
[Grunts]
[Whimpering] What do you guys want?
You been messin' around with little kids again, Benny?
- I ain't done a thing.
- What were you running for?
I was scared.
I'd be too if I was the cocaine killer.
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.
I got treatment while I was away.
The docs, they fixed up my head.
What's that, Benny?
Oh, hey, th-that's just a fantasy life now.
Pretty rich life.
The doc said it was okay.
Doctor said you could read this?
Yeah.
Well, me and him, we got a difference of opinion.
I think it's time to throw out the garbage.
Wha— [Screaming]
No!
No!
It doesn't hurt nobody!
Please, no!
Cyrus, hold on a second.
Listen, Benny.
I think I can get him to not do this— [Whimpering]
If you just tell us all you know about the murders.
Think real hard, Benny.
All right!
All right!
Please!
Please!
Let him down.
[Breathing Heavily]
One of Captain George's winos... s-saw something in the park the other night.
He tell the police?
No.
The winos never tell anything except to Captain George.
What he saw is supposed to be worth something, he said.
That's all I know.
I swear.
Come on.
Let's go.
It's just a fantasy life.
All in my head.
[ManSingingRock]
[Continues]
[Fades]
You gentlemen looking for accommodations?
Actually, uh, we hear you know something about the kid they found dead in the park the other night.
Yeah.
Terrible thing.
You more cops?
Don't insult us.
Well, the cops, I say nothing.
It's an old habit.
But, uh, to more reasonable men, I, uh—
Pay him.
[Clearing Throat]
Is that enough?
[Sighs] Well, one of the winos, a guy they call the Prophet, was in here babbling about something strange going on down there the other night.
Is he here?
No, no.
He didn't have the price of a flop, so I sent him on his way.
He's probably down in the park right now sittin' on his bench.
[People On Ride Screaming]
[High-pitched Voice] You're not gonna give up on me now, are you?
You don't have any guts.
[Normal Voice, High-pitched Voice] I'm not having fun.
It's not supposed to be fun.
Look over there.
[Gunshots]
Well, the Prophet kept talking about dolls.
Looks like we're in the right place.
Are you guys crazy?
Cyrus, what's the hell's the matter with you?
He a friend of yours?
Rickman.
I know him.
Works for Delgado.
He's one of them big chiefs you seen at the meetin'.
Tell me something, Mr. Rickman, the other night when that girl got killed, did anybody win any of these dolls?
Nobody wins anything here.
You gotta hit three birds in a row, and that's hard to do with two bullets and a blank.
They're very special dolls.
Hey, man, that was two grand worth of coke you just blew up!
Nice idea, huh?
Dealers come, drop off the cash, pick up a doll, return the empty.
Yeah, Delgado ain't gonna like what you just did.
Tell me something, what do you like?
You like filling up young girls with coke?
Hmm?
Just like the dolls.
[Gunshot]
- Hey, is this guy crazy?
- He's asking you a serious question, my friend.
Tell me something, the night the girl got killed, who picked up the doll?
Nobody.
There was no business that night.
[Gunshot]
They—They—They—
Nobody picked up anything.
Just—
- Just what?
- It was just Delgado.
Uh, he picked up an empty.
Delgado?
Now, think real hard.
Was it just the same doll that they found with the girl?
How should I know?
Newspapers, television.
Plus your eye for dolls.
This one's gonna take off your ear.
Hey, uh, okay, okay.
Well, maybe it was the same one.
You know, I mean, uh— I mean, we-we don't carry 'em anymore.
Was I supposed to say somethin' about this?
I mean, it's Delgado we're talkin' about.
Where is he?
[Calliope]
Delgado.
This is bad business, man.
Which one of them turns you on, Delgado?
[People Screaming, Clamoring]
Delgado!
[High-pitched Voice] Don't hurt him!
He's a nice man!
Oh!
Don't hurt him!
Don't— No, please don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him.
No!
He just wanted to play.
Don't hurt him!
[Sobbing]
[Tubbs] We should have arrested him on the spot.
Then the cover's blown.
We can't just can't stand by and let Palmo kill him.
Man, we don't even have a weapon.
It probably wouldn't do any good anyway.
They probably got a ton of metal in here.
So what's next, counsel?
[Sighs] Try to see if we can talk him out of here.
Mr. Burnett, Mr. Cooper, you did a good job.
I told you this problem could be solved.
But Delgado— Makes me sick to think I know the man.
Why'd you bring him here?
We're gonna hold a trial in this building.
Trial?
[Palmer] I can'tjust kill Delgado.
It would start a war if no one knew why.
So he's gonna be judged, as they say, by a jury of his peers.
Why not just turn him over to the police?
To the police?
[Crockett] Yeah.
We caught Delgado, not them.
It's our world he betrayed.
We'll deal with him.
The man's just sick.
If you turn him in, you're a hero.
Hey, I forgot.
You're a lawyer.
You give him a real professional defense.
You get him off, he's yours.
Cyrus.
This way, gentlemen.
[Clears Throat]
Now, you— You wait outside.
No problem.
There's your client.
Mr. Palmo says you got one hour to make up your defense.
Who are you?
Palmo's gonna put you on trial.
I'm gonna defend you.
Against what?
You shot up four girls with cocaine, dressed 'em up like dolls and then killed 'em.
You do remember that?
Yeah.
- Who's going to judge me?
- Your friends.
My friends?
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
I know you.
Yeah, the amusement park, remember?
No.
No, you were at the meeting.
[Sighs]
Yeah.
Yeah.
Burnett and Cooper.
You guys had a big deal to make, right?
- Delgado, I'm gonna have to ask you some questions.
- Yeah, good.
I got one to ask you first.
Does it rain every day in Miami?
Ha-cha-cha.
Yeah, that's right.
You're a cop.
I'm your contact.
Look, you better get me out of this, or I'm gonna give you up, and we both end up dead.
Bring the prisoner in.
Delgado's our contact.
You gotta be kidding.
You got to get to a phone around here somewhere and tell Castillo.
If we lose Delgado, we'll never take Palmo down.
What are you gonna do?
Defend my client.
All right.
Let's begin.
The defendant has a counselor.
Even some of the jury are his own men.
The prosecutor will be me.
And I'm going to prove that that man— that man who drugged, assaulted and killed... deserves, under any form of justice, to be killed himself.
Hey, you gotta protect me now.
I mean, like, what's going on between Palmo and Delgado—
I don't wanna be mashed in the middle, okay?
We got a deal.
Lieutenant, you're not gonna believe this.
What's going on?
I think we got him.
The squeeze paid off.
You know a Paul Delgado?
He's one of the big ones.
Bigger than you think.
He's our coke killer.
Delgado.
According to one very scared witness, that's what all the shooting was about last night.
Palmo's boys doing a little rough police work.
Where's Delgado now?
Uh, sounds like Palmo's got him.
[Police Radio, Indistinct]
No one's here except the security guards.
I just got word from Metro that no one's home.
Fuentes, Beausourire—
Even the dealers are gone.
What, the drug world's taken the night off?
Something's coming down.
Get in.
Now, everyone in this room has suffered... because of what the defendant has done.
This is not just a matter of business.
It's a matter of who we are.
And we have nothing in common with that man!
You can prove that by the sentence you pass on him.
First, he has a right to a defense.
I mean, this is a trial.
[Crockett] We are different from this man.
Yes, we are very different from this man.
At least we know what we're doing when we break the law.
We weigh the risks... against the profits,
and we do what's necessary.
He knew!
He knew what he was doing!
But not the way that we do.
I'm going to put you in his mind... and let you live there for a while.
And then you tell me what you think.
[Line Ringing] Castillo.
Hey, Castillo, this is Tubbs.
We're at the 1235 Club.
You know where it's at?
1235 Club.
We're about 10 minutes away.
Yeah, you better make it fast, 'cause I don't know—
Your butt is mine now.
[Grunting] Tubbs?
Let— Let—
Let me go, man.
Hey, what your doin'?
Told you we was gonna dance, boy.
Come on, chump.
So, you see— [Clears Throat]
We—we have a choice.
We had a choice... as to which side of the law we were gonna stand on, and we chose to break the law.
This man, he has no choice.
You have no choice, no say, and so you walk... toward something horrible,
and you can't stop.
Oh, you see the horror, and you don't want to go, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must!
My God.
[Chuckles]
Gentlemen, that is hell.
Can you imagine— any of you—
having to live in that hell?
[Murmuring]
Very dramatic.
See, but outside of the defendant mind is the real world.
And in that world, four little girls are dead!
You know the verdict we expect.
[High-pitched Voice, Normal Voice] They're going to hurt you.
Be quiet.
[High-pitched Voice] Those nasty men are going to hurt you.
You didn't do anything bad.
[Normal Voice, High-pitched Voice] I just wanted to play.
Well, now they're gonna punish you.
But they'll have to catch us first.
Run!
Run!
[Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
Get him down.
[High-pitched Voice] Why didn't you run out the door?
Why did you go up the stairs?
I'm scared up here!
[Normal Voice] Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I can fly.
Can you hear me down there?
I can fly.
You'll never get me because I can fly!
[High-pitched Voice] No, you can't fly.
I can fly.
Take the ladder back down now!
[Normal Voice] No, I'm gonna fly, because you're all—
[High-pitched Voice] Bad men!
[Screaming]
[Body Thuds]
[Chattering]
[Door Opens]
All right.
Police.
Everybody just be smart.
What happened?
Justice.
The murderer is dead.
Which one is it?
Take your pick.
[Girl Crying Softly, Whimpering]
[Crying, Whimpering Continues]
[Man, High-pitched Voice] You look so pretty.
Yes, you do.
Don't cry.
This is gonna make you feel so pretty too, just like the belle of the ball.
I promise.
Don't cry.
Yeah!
Be careful now.
[Crying, Whimpering Continue]
Don't hurt her.
Be gentle.
[Whimpering Intensifies]
Oh, this will make her feel better.
[Normal Voice] Now I can take that nasty tape off your pretty mouth.
Oh, yeah.
[High-pitched Voice] You're hurting her!
[Normal Voice] Don't worry.
I can make it feel all better with just one little kiss.
Mr. Cooper?
I'm Burnett.
He's Cooper.
Mr. Burnett.
Yeah.
Mr. Palmo.
Burnett, Cooper.
Which one of you is the legal genius?
I have a law degree.
You can move money legally all around the world?
Advice on international currency and banking laws.
What I'm paid for.
Your friend?
Mr. Cooper is vice president in charge of collections.
You come with good credentials, but, um, I like personal relationships, so you're gonna be my guests for a while until I get to know you.
You'll enjoy yourselves.
There's a party almost every night.
Well, gee, Mr. Palmo, we didn't bring our toothbrushes.
Toothbrushes, tuxedos, companionship.
It's all here.
Well, I guess we could rough it.
This way, gentlemen.
Sweet dreams, angel.
There we go.
Semi-elegant.
I hate the color of my toothbrush.
Want mine?
No.
Mine's the same color.
Well, we've made it into the castle of the king of drug land, and we haven't lost our heads yet.
This is good.
Now all we have to do is wait for our heavy friend who's in court to come and speak to us in code.
Yeah, and ask us if it rains every day in Miami.
Give me a break.
[Knocking] Come in.
Hi.
I see you've got your tuxes and a toothbrush.
You must be the companionship.
Mr. Palmo asked me... to invite you both down to join the party.
My name's Arlene.
[Laughs]
Well, we're party people, Arlene.
It's gonna be a very enjoyable evening.
[Clamoring]
This is the third teenage girl who's turned up strangled, assaulted and pumped full of cocaine.
What kind of monster do we have here?
[Woman] And the dolls and the matching costumes?
What's Vice got to do with it?
You gonna tell us these kids were hookers?
I'm looking at the only whores in this investigation.
You got plenty to keep your readers turned on.
Get off my back.
It's a homicide, Jarell.
Not anymore.
This is Mr. Taggert from the D.A. Office.
The mayor feels that since the bodies have been found saturated with cocaine, that your department could be of some help.
I want you to shake up your beat, Castillo— the dealers, the pushers, the users.
We have an investigation that's taken months to put into place.
Some of my best people are undercover.
They need the support of the rest of the unit.
The mayor feels that the whole city is on the line.
We're not talking a drop in the tourist trade.
I'll see what I can do.
My chef won a free gastronomique in Paris... for the way he prepares this dish.
Well, that's just thrilling, Mr. Palmo, and we've really enjoyed sharing these finer things in life with you these past three days, but, uh, when are we gonna get down to business?
[Gulping]
Cyrus, that's a Château Latour, 1934.
It's meant to be sipped, not gulped like a can of beer.
Well, I wish it was beer.
I mean, this Miami weather's the pits.
I mean, it is hot.
I done sweat through four shirts a day down here, and I'm a Georgia boy.
I am sorry.
I really shouldn't allow him to sit at the same table, but, uh, three times he's taken a bullet meant for me.
Maybe that's why he sweats.
[Clears Throat] Well, you see, we have our own schedule to keep.
We need an answer.
First, though I'm well respected in the business, the, um, decision isn't mine alone.
I have Colombians, Cubans, Haitians, Mexicans, Canadians, a various assortment of native-born Americans to deal with.
A variety of cultural backgrounds, Mr. Burnett, each with its own way of doing business, each very sensitive.
They must all feel... included.
And besides, there's a special problem right now.
A problem?
These cocaine killings.
Not a good image for the business.
Well, while you worry about your public relations problems, my friend and I will go and ponder how much this waste of our time is gonna cost you.
Delicious menu.
Tripe a la mode du Caen.
You know what that is, Cyrus?
Chitlins.
Should make a good old boy from Georgia feel right at home.
Excuse me.
They both got smart mouths.
If they can supply what they say they can, they have a right to be a little arrogant.
So be nice.
'Cause right now, I need them.
[Man] What am I gonna do?
Oh!
Oh, what am I gonna do?
[Sighs] What am I gonna do?
[High-pitched Voice] Don't worry.
You'll find another ballerina as beautiful as I am.
[Normal Voice] All right.
All right.
All right.
You can trash these, Castillo.
That's all we have— perverts, users, psychological profiles.
The complete creep list.
That's not what I need.
It's the coke that's the special angle.
This isn't stepped-on street junk.
The autopsies rate it at 100% pure.
That means this creep had connections.
That puts it in your backyard, Castillo.
You know the big dealers.
Let's make this their problem.
Two of my men could be caught right in the middle.
They're good.
They'll make the right moves.

[Man On TV] The horror of these murders is beyond anything I've reported on... in 15 years of covering the Miami crime beat.
The sexual assault and murder of teenage girls.
A doll left— who knows why— with their bodies.
And then, his special trademark, his comment on the times— cocaine injected into his victims.
The rape and murder of drugged kids.
Whoever this cocaine killer is, he's put together the ultimate American nightmare.
And now, today, he's struck again.
The victim, 16-year-old Lisa Fentress of Coral Gables, was foundjust after dawn.
Let's hope somebody somewhere in South Florida who knows who this killer is—
That doll's so pretty.
I use to have one just like it.
Oh, yeah?
I collect dolls.
Really?
You like dolls, huh?
I got a collection of them at home.
Maybe sometime you could stop by and see.
I can't now.
My mom's gonna be here any second.
I have a phone in my car.
We could call her up.
[Woman] Vicky!
I don't think so.
She's here right now.
I gotta go, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
[High-pitched Voice] Why didn't you just grab her?
I liked her.
[Clamoring] Please, ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention.
The mayor cannot answer questions at this time, but I do have a statement to read.
"The city of Miami has the equivalent of a plague on its hands— an epidemic that has to be dealt with in the most severe way."
[High-pitched Voice] He's calling you a disease.
He's got a lot of nerve, huh?
"...to protect their children, to make it impossible...
"for this so-called 'doll killer' to exist among us.
"I'm giving our police department the greatest possible powers...
"to extend their investigations into every corner of the city.
And I'm sure the people will understand and cooperate."
Are we talking about some sort of martial law?
[Clamoring]
I said there was a disease in our city.
And you don't fight a disease with warnings and Miranda warrants.
Good day.
[Clamoring]
[Sighs] I win again.
You know, they closed down three of Mr. Palmo's nightclubs last night.
And then some guy from the racing commission comes by and quarantines his entire stable.
That's real heat when they start arresting your horses.
I don't think Mr. Palmo found it funny.
Maybe not.
But horses are probably the only animals he's got working for him with brains.
You know, someday, you and me are gonna dance.
Strike up the band, baby.
Cooper, you look fresh.
See if you can hit a longer ball than your friend.
Remember, let him win.
No problem.
[Chattering] [Man Coughing]
[Man] Look, you got no right to have kept me here all night... just because I once had a little problem!
Two convictions for child molesting is not a little problem, Benny.
Oh, hey, listen.
I wouldn't waste coke on a kid if I was gonna snuff her.
I wouldn't do that.
That-That's a waste of serious money.
I would never do that.
Can you tell us what the questioning was about, Mr. Fuentes?
True that your employees have been arrested?
Reverend Beausourire, your church was raided by the police this morning.
Can you say why?
Yeah, I can tell you why.
You want a statement?
I'll give you a statement.
The police have gone crazy.
That's my statement.
I run a legitimate import business.
And this gentlemen is a pastor of a church, a man of God.
What have we to do with these insane murders?
Come on.
Being the head of a voodoo cult group isn't exactly a character reference.
I have two little daughters myself.
You mean you're suspects?
That's it.
No more questions.
So Fuentes and Reverend Beausourire are unhappy.
A rough estimate puts Fuentes's import business at one-tenth pre-Colombian art... and nine-tenths Colombian flake.
And the good reverend's the only church in town that's got a bank in the Bahamas.
All we're gonna get out of this is a lot of suits for harassment.
Let the mayor's office worry about that.
What about Palmo?
He's being squeezed.
Yeah, but not face-to-face.
If your boys are with Palmo, it's gonna look a little strange if we pass him over.
I'll take care of that.
[Chattering, Laughing]
[High-pitched Voice] Look at them.
Their skins all flushed.
Physical exercise.
Yeah!
I love to see them sweat.
I love it.
It's so physical.
I love it.
That's no way to treat a lady.
You gonna let a couple of cops scare you away?
[Muffled Talking]
[Normal Voice] Don't worry.
We'll come back.
Look, Fuentes, they've been hitting my places too.
They don't think we have anything to do with these girls turning up dead.
We're symbols.
Yeah, symbols.
That's right, Fuentes.
Like fall guys.
Why haven't they picked me up yet, Fuentes?
[Footsteps Approaching]
They just walked in the door.
You make the arrangements.
I'll be a little busy.
Castillo, isn't it?
I think we had an unpleasant conversation about a year ago.
We're about to have another one.
You got a warrant?
I don't think they'd impress an attorney.
When you call one, tell him that your yacht's been impounded.
I hope it's not damaged when they strip it.
Why hit us, Castillo?
Some girls go out looking for a good time.
They want to get high, run into some weirdo.
That's street stuff.
The girls had no drug record.
The cocaine was almost pure— kind of stuff you and your friends like to bring in.
We're businessmen.
We don't knock off teenagers for kicks.
No, just for profit.
[Normal Voice] There's nothing happening here, sweetheart.
Let's go back to the school.
Maybe— Maybe we'll just cruise around and find a nice new friend to play with.
[Ringing] [High-pitched Voice] Don't answer it.
Don't answer it!
What?
Yeah.
This man sure does love his exercise.
All right.
We gotta get outta here.
If our contact doesn't show soon, the only rain in Miami is gonna be on our parade.
I don't think it's ever gonna rain in Miami again.
Look, they're shaking things up downtown, right?
They want to catch the killer.
Figure they push Palmo, he might help.
So we push too.
We'll make him think we're running out on the deal.
We gotta make it look good, so let's be serious.
Trust you gentlemen are enjoying yourselves?
Oh, yes, Mr. Palmo.
But, uh, listen.
Thanks for the nice toothbrush, but we—we gotta be leaving.
Really?
Yeah, and since you've been such a generous host, we won't even charge you for the wasted time.
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
What's the point in keepin' us here?
You're out of business.
Temporary problem.
It'll be solved.
How?
You'll see... tonight.
Well, so much for that.
My friends, these gentlemen with me, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Cooper, are a perfect example of what I've been talking about.
They're businessmen whose expertise could be profitable to all of us.
But they've been made to feel uncomfortable by the situation we find ourselves in.
As long as this scum, this killer of young girls is loose, we will be persecuted by the police with the public's blessings,
even though we, as fathers, as men, want him stopped as much as they do.
We need the law's protection like every other citizen.
Maybe more.
So, as of now, the business is to find this scum.
Everything else— petty feuds, shipments, deals— shuts down till he's off the street.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Done.
Yeah.
Agreed.
Let's get him.
[Rock]
This makes me sick.
I'm gonna go for a drive.
How hard do we come down?
Whatever it takes.
They're all dead anyway.
[High-pitched Voice, Normal Voice] I'm scared.
We're going home.

He's one of the first the cops would've picked up.
Well, let's see what he has to say to us.
Sounds like fun.
Hi, Sammy.
Can I have my key?
Thanks.
How you doing today?
I'm doing okay too.
How you doin', Benny?
[Shouts]
[Grunts]
[Whimpering] What do you guys want?
You been messin' around with little kids again, Benny?
- I ain't done a thing.
- What were you running for?
I was scared.
I'd be too if I was the cocaine killer.
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.
I got treatment while I was away.
The docs, they fixed up my head.
What's that, Benny?
Oh, hey, th-that's just a fantasy life now.
Pretty rich life.
The doc said it was okay.
Doctor said you could read this?
Yeah.
Well, me and him, we got a difference of opinion.
I think it's time to throw out the garbage.
Wha— [Screaming]
No!
No!
It doesn't hurt nobody!
Please, no!
Cyrus, hold on a second.
Listen, Benny.
I think I can get him to not do this— [Whimpering]
If you just tell us all you know about the murders.
Think real hard, Benny.
All right!
All right!
Please!
Please!
Let him down.
[Breathing Heavily]
One of Captain George's winos... s-saw something in the park the other night.
He tell the police?
No.
The winos never tell anything except to Captain George.
What he saw is supposed to be worth something, he said.
That's all I know.
I swear.
Come on.
Let's go.
It's just a fantasy life.
All in my head.
[ManSingingRock]
[Continues]
[Fades]
You gentlemen looking for accommodations?
Actually, uh, we hear you know something about the kid they found dead in the park the other night.
Yeah.
Terrible thing.
You more cops?
Don't insult us.
Well, the cops, I say nothing.
It's an old habit.
But, uh, to more reasonable men, I, uh—
Pay him.
[Clearing Throat]
Is that enough?
[Sighs] Well, one of the winos, a guy they call the Prophet, was in here babbling about something strange going on down there the other night.
Is he here?
No, no.
He didn't have the price of a flop, so I sent him on his way.
He's probably down in the park right now sittin' on his bench.
[People On Ride Screaming]
[High-pitched Voice] You're not gonna give up on me now, are you?
You don't have any guts.
[Normal Voice, High-pitched Voice] I'm not having fun.
It's not supposed to be fun.
Look over there.
[Gunshots]
Well, the Prophet kept talking about dolls.
Looks like we're in the right place.
Are you guys crazy?
Cyrus, what's the hell's the matter with you?
He a friend of yours?
Rickman.
I know him.
Works for Delgado.
He's one of them big chiefs you seen at the meetin'.
Tell me something, Mr. Rickman, the other night when that girl got killed, did anybody win any of these dolls?
Nobody wins anything here.
You gotta hit three birds in a row, and that's hard to do with two bullets and a blank.
They're very special dolls.
Hey, man, that was two grand worth of coke you just blew up!
Nice idea, huh?
Dealers come, drop off the cash, pick up a doll, return the empty.
Yeah, Delgado ain't gonna like what you just did.
Tell me something, what do you like?
You like filling up young girls with coke?
Hmm?
Just like the dolls.
[Gunshot]
- Hey, is this guy crazy?
- He's asking you a serious question, my friend.
Tell me something, the night the girl got killed, who picked up the doll?
Nobody.
There was no business that night.
[Gunshot]
They—They—They—
Nobody picked up anything.
Just—
- Just what?
- It was just Delgado.
Uh, he picked up an empty.
Delgado?
Now, think real hard.
Was it just the same doll that they found with the girl?
How should I know?
Newspapers, television.
Plus your eye for dolls.
This one's gonna take off your ear.
Hey, uh, okay, okay.
Well, maybe it was the same one.
You know, I mean, uh— I mean, we-we don't carry 'em anymore.
Was I supposed to say somethin' about this?
I mean, it's Delgado we're talkin' about.
Where is he?
[Calliope]
Delgado.
This is bad business, man.
Which one of them turns you on, Delgado?
[People Screaming, Clamoring]
Delgado!
[High-pitched Voice] Don't hurt him!
He's a nice man!
Oh!
Don't hurt him!
Don't— No, please don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him.
No!
He just wanted to play.
Don't hurt him!
[Sobbing]
[Tubbs] We should have arrested him on the spot.
Then the cover's blown.
We can't just can't stand by and let Palmo kill him.
Man, we don't even have a weapon.
It probably wouldn't do any good anyway.
They probably got a ton of metal in here.
So what's next, counsel?
[Sighs] Try to see if we can talk him out of here.
Mr. Burnett, Mr. Cooper, you did a good job.
I told you this problem could be solved.
But Delgado— Makes me sick to think I know the man.
Why'd you bring him here?
We're gonna hold a trial in this building.
Trial?
[Palmer] I can'tjust kill Delgado.
It would start a war if no one knew why.
So he's gonna be judged, as they say, by a jury of his peers.
Why not just turn him over to the police?
To the police?
[Crockett] Yeah.
We caught Delgado, not them.
It's our world he betrayed.
We'll deal with him.
The man's just sick.
If you turn him in, you're a hero.
Hey, I forgot.
You're a lawyer.
You give him a real professional defense.
You get him off, he's yours.
Cyrus.
This way, gentlemen.
[Clears Throat]
Now, you— You wait outside.
No problem.
There's your client.
Mr. Palmo says you got one hour to make up your defense.
Who are you?
Palmo's gonna put you on trial.
I'm gonna defend you.
Against what?
You shot up four girls with cocaine, dressed 'em up like dolls and then killed 'em.
You do remember that?
Yeah.
- Who's going to judge me?
- Your friends.
My friends?
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
I know you.
Yeah, the amusement park, remember?
No.
No, you were at the meeting.
[Sighs]
Yeah.
Yeah.
Burnett and Cooper.
You guys had a big deal to make, right?
- Delgado, I'm gonna have to ask you some questions.
- Yeah, good.
I got one to ask you first.
Does it rain every day in Miami?
Ha-cha-cha.
Yeah, that's right.
You're a cop.
I'm your contact.
Look, you better get me out of this, or I'm gonna give you up, and we both end up dead.
Bring the prisoner in.
Delgado's our contact.
You gotta be kidding.
You got to get to a phone around here somewhere and tell Castillo.
If we lose Delgado, we'll never take Palmo down.
What are you gonna do?
Defend my client.
All right.
Let's begin.
The defendant has a counselor.
Even some of the jury are his own men.
The prosecutor will be me.
And I'm going to prove that that man— that man who drugged, assaulted and killed... deserves, under any form of justice, to be killed himself.
Hey, you gotta protect me now.
I mean, like, what's going on between Palmo and Delgado—
I don't wanna be mashed in the middle, okay?
We got a deal.
Lieutenant, you're not gonna believe this.
What's going on?
I think we got him.
The squeeze paid off.
You know a Paul Delgado?
He's one of the big ones.
Bigger than you think.
He's our coke killer.
Delgado.
According to one very scared witness, that's what all the shooting was about last night.
Palmo's boys doing a little rough police work.
Where's Delgado now?
Uh, sounds like Palmo's got him.
[Police Radio, Indistinct]
No one's here except the security guards.
I just got word from Metro that no one's home.
Fuentes, Beausourire—
Even the dealers are gone.
What, the drug world's taken the night off?
Something's coming down.
Get in.
Now, everyone in this room has suffered... because of what the defendant has done.
This is not just a matter of business.
It's a matter of who we are.
And we have nothing in common with that man!
You can prove that by the sentence you pass on him.
First, he has a right to a defense.
I mean, this is a trial.
[Crockett] We are different from this man.
Yes, we are very different from this man.
At least we know what we're doing when we break the law.
We weigh the risks... against the profits,
and we do what's necessary.
He knew!
He knew what he was doing!
But not the way that we do.
I'm going to put you in his mind... and let you live there for a while.
And then you tell me what you think.
[Line Ringing] Castillo.
Hey, Castillo, this is Tubbs.
We're at the 1235 Club.
You know where it's at?
1235 Club.
We're about 10 minutes away.
Yeah, you better make it fast, 'cause I don't know—
Your butt is mine now.
[Grunting] Tubbs?
Let— Let—
Let me go, man.
Hey, what your doin'?
Told you we was gonna dance, boy.
Come on, chump.
So, you see— [Clears Throat]
We—we have a choice.
We had a choice... as to which side of the law we were gonna stand on, and we chose to break the law.
This man, he has no choice.
You have no choice, no say, and so you walk... toward something horrible,
and you can't stop.
Oh, you see the horror, and you don't want to go, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must.
You don't want to, but you must!
My God.
[Chuckles]
Gentlemen, that is hell.
Can you imagine— any of you—
having to live in that hell?
[Murmuring]
Very dramatic.
See, but outside of the defendant mind is the real world.
And in that world, four little girls are dead!
You know the verdict we expect.
[High-pitched Voice, Normal Voice] They're going to hurt you.
Be quiet.
[High-pitched Voice] Those nasty men are going to hurt you.
You didn't do anything bad.
[Normal Voice, High-pitched Voice] I just wanted to play.
Well, now they're gonna punish you.
But they'll have to catch us first.
Run!
Run!
[Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
Get him down.
[High-pitched Voice] Why didn't you run out the door?
Why did you go up the stairs?
I'm scared up here!
[Normal Voice] Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I can fly.
Can you hear me down there?
I can fly.
You'll never get me because I can fly!
[High-pitched Voice] No, you can't fly.
I can fly.
Take the ladder back down now!
[Normal Voice] No, I'm gonna fly, because you're all—
[High-pitched Voice] Bad men!
[Screaming]
[Body Thuds]
[Chattering]
[Door Opens]
All right.
Police.
Everybody just be smart.
What happened?
Justice.
The murderer is dead.
Which one is it?
Take your pick.
** [theme]
[laughing]
Agh, Television.
I hate-
- Why do I always land on Television.
Can't this generation define itself by something other than old songs or members of old television shows?
[humming together]
I mean old tunes from old TV shows, [vocalizing theme from The Dick Van Dyke Show]
Sunday, Buddy and Sally on The Dick Van Dyke Show.
Oh, God, you remember the one with the walnuts?
You know with the aliens?
And they all get the door and they all fall on top of them.
How about the one where they think they bring the wrong baby
- from the hospital.
- Oh, that was the best.
And it turns out the father's Greg Moore.
Oh, that was so good.
I've been wasting my time reading Ivanhoe.
1958, Roger Moore, made in England.
Do you ever noticed how mothers are always dead on those TV shows?
Like Bachelor Father, My Three Sons, and that one with Brian Keith and the fat guy.
I always used to think about that whenever my mother was yelling at me.
Oh.
I used to stay home from school and watch all these shows.
And I used to think, Oh, my God.
Is this way life is suppose to be?
You know I mean Chip, you know?
One week he starts his own business and he makes all his money.
And the next week he's flunky out of school, right?
Because he's chairmen of the dance committee.
[laughs]
Only what happen to the business, you know?
Come on, I love TV.
I mean, everybody always nice, and everybody always happy.
[Gary] Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
[together] What?
They played Buddy and Sally.
[together] Right.
I just remember the episode where they were executed as Russian spies.
- Yeah.
- Terrible.
[Ellyn] I ain't even gonna play this game.
[Michael] Is that enough?
Michael, it's a tricycle.
That's a huge present.
Well, I know, but what if she doesn't like it?
Then there's no back up.
Maybe we should order the entire FAO Schwarz catalog just to be safe.
And the presents my parents are sending and the ridiculous clothes that Melissa will buy her and things you've already bought her for Hanukkah.
I mean, and anyway--
I'm not changing the subject.
I'm talking about Christmas.
No, you're talking about presents.
I just want to know if we're talking about the same holiday here.
Ugh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
- We get a tree and a menorah.
- Correct.
Are we talking lights on the outside of the house?
Are we talking going to synagogue?
Okay.
Theology.
You want to know if I accept December 25th as the birth of Jesus.
- Michael.
- Okay, okay, I accept it.
Now, you want to know if I accept that a star lead three wise men to a manger or a lady who claims she hadn't had sex just had a baby who was the son of God.
And I'm suppose to accept that a tiny drop oil lasted eight days and that six men with bows and arrows defeat all the Roman legions?
Syrians.
Okay, okay.
I'll give you the star and the three wise men if you agree to no lights outside, presents, and at least two nights of Hanukkah.
And a 50% reduction in medium range ballistic missiles.
Listen, Michael, I just want this all to be okay.
I mean, last year you were so sad and obnoxious.
And because--
Well, because--
And because--
It's Christmas.
Right.
[Michael] So tomorrow at the airport,
I'm gonna get you know one of those airplanes that fly back to you for Elliot.
He loves those.
[Hope] Which leaves Ethan, Nancy, and Ellyn.
[Michael] I'll Ethan one, too.
Oh, I feel sorry for Ethan.
Nancy says all he talks about is shooting down Santa Claus with a missile launcher.
I know, look, a little heat seeking action.
You know a SAM6?
That would do the trick.
Oh, great.
And then there's Brittany and Carol and Linda.
Okay, open up for Mommy.
Just a couple bites before we go.
No, you don't want any?
You want to feed yourself?
Okay, you do it.
There's Jim, Barton, and your brother.
We don't have to get him anything.
Oh, and there's your mother and my parents.
And-
- Oh, God, the post office.
I'm gonna spend my entire lunch hour standing in line.
- You want me not to go?
- No, I want you to go.
- I just want you to be in two places at once.
- [bowl falls]
Oh, sweetie, did you spill?
Oh.
Oh, sweetheart.
Michael?
You know what?
I got an idea.
We pick out a charity, and we make donations in everybody's name.
It's quick, it's virtuous, and it's convenient.
Yeah, Steve, David, Marlene.
No, the AIDS project.
The homeless.
Wait, there's some right there.
Oh, well, give me that.
Thank you.
Yeah, Michael, I know.
I mean, it's Christmas, and you do make donations, but you still have to buy presents.
But why?
Can you explain to me again why they wait a year to put up your father's headstone?
They want to make sure he's really dead.
Oh, okay, okay.
- You leave tomorrow.
- Um-hm.
And you come back Friday morning which brings us to Christmas Eve.
And that means the food and the chairs and the tree.
[Hope] Okay, we got to go.
All right.
You know, Janey, didn't anybody ever tell you that you're always late, huh?
That you're always late for daycare.
And did they tell you that socialization begins at preschool housing?
- Say goodbye to Daddy.
- Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Okay, good.
We're late.
You want that?
Okay, we'll get it later, sweetie.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
[Hope] Say bye-bye.
Bye.
It's just life.
[laughter on TV]
- [applause on TV] - [car starts]
[TV show theme music]
Honey, I'm-- home.
Honey?
Whoa!
[laugh track]
You have to take a look at what-- [applause track]
Little Janey did today.
[laugh track]
It's beautiful.
What's that?
Oh, just a list of presents we have to buy.
[laugh track]
Honey, I am so glad to be home.
You know what Thornback did today?
Ah, you don't want to know.
I don't want to know, but I have to know.
All you have to know... is that I'm so glad to be home.
- But that's--
- Alone with my very own wife.
Ready to spend the night doing absolutely nothing.
Recharging the battery.
Shutting out the entire world.
Not speaking to another living soul until tomorrow.
Mikey.
[applause track]
Ho ho ho, big fella.
Hey, how's that ad game going?
Elliot, how are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Ah, just a small flood in the kitchen.
Old Nance put a little too much soap in the dishwasher again.
If he'd done the dishes sometime in the past two years, he would have known that the dishwasher is broken.
Oh-ho.
You want to air our dirty dishes in public?
Real funny, Dad.
[laugh track, applause track] [weather man on TV] Look out, Delaware Valley.
With the holiday season upon us,
I guess that's the time of year we can anticipate some snowhere throughout Bucks County and Montgomery County, throughout the entire greater Philadelphia area.
We said the Poconos are already getting some of that snowfall.
Uh, gonna be a little--
Oh, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it!
Okay, okay.
So the guy walks in and he says,
"Don't give me a cherry soda.
I'm not into berry soda.
"Let me have the very soda that I really need."
[imitating boombox]
"Latten's natural, general working, fast action, mineral tonic."
A rap song to sell laxative?
What the hell do you want from me?
I'm sick of this.
I am, I'm sick of this.
I'm sick of carrying this business.
I'm sick of you sitting there passing judgment on every idea I have inhibiting my creativity.
We could show before and after pictures.
Look, I know why I'm not working.
Why are you not working?
I am working, just badly.
Tomorrow I see my father's headstone.
- That should be fun.
- Yeah.
I don't know if I want to be buried.
Aw, come on.
Putrefaction is part of the life cycle.
Replenishing the soil.
Plants can grow.
Animals can eat.
People can eat animals and get clogged arteries and die.
Replenish the soil some more.
Hey, you want to know what I'm getting you for Christmas?
I don't believe in Christmas.
I'm gonna shoot down
Santa's reindeer with a machine gun.
Yeah, I thought Ethan wanted a missile launcher?
Yeah, weapons change daily and ordnance.
Really?
What are you gonna do about it?
Tell Santa to take out insurance.
I mean what can I do?
Well, it's the first Christmas since we broke up.
Who can blame him?
Is there anything we can do?
Yeah, tell his parents to get their crap together.
[sighs]
All right, okay here we go.
Okay, this is it.
Right here.
Rock and roll.
This is it.
Right here, okay.
- Two guys.
- Two guys, okay.
I like that.
- Old guys.
- Old guys, all right.
Two very old guys, all right?
Only it's the future.
So they got these weird cloths on, right?
People are floating by, and one of them says to the other one,
[Bronx accent] "So are you going to Mars today?"
And the other says,
[Brooklyn accent] "Go to Mars?
I can't even go to the toilet."
It's great.
- This is the future?
- Right.
People have accents like that?
Never mind, Elliot.
Wouldn't people not have accents like that?
No, Elliot, Elliot, it's a commercial in the present.
It's suppose to funny now.
Never mind, Elliot.
Mikey, that's really good.
Forget it.
Blow the whole thing up.
I don't care.
I don't want to do this anymore.
- You're a funny guy.
- Apparently, Elliot.
[intercom beeps]
- Funny, that's very funny.
- What?
[Jewish accent] What, go to the bath or toilet?
What is it?
Beam me up Scotty, I get up.
What?
What?
Wait, what?
Well, put him on.
Yes.
When?
No, wait.
What do you mean?
What do-- Well, is she--
What hospital?
What do you mean you can't tell me she's not okay?
Um-hum, all right.
All right, okay.
Um, Hope was in an accident with Janey.
They're at the hospital.
They took them to the hospital, and then they won't tell me anything.
Oh, my God, Janey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No, no, S-T-E-A-D-M-A-N.
I'm gonna to have to page Dr. Richards.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Why do you have to page him?
Can't you just tell me if she's okay?
Is she alive?
Sir, your wife is alive.
Now just sit down.
Doctor will be with you in the minute.
All right.
[sighs] [baby cries]
Oh, baby, Come here, come here.
Okay, okay.
Are you Mr. Steadman?
Yeah, Daddy's here.
The contusions on her face look worst than they are.
And there's no evidence of concussion.
She's lucky really that she had her seat belt on.
And in terms of any internal stuff?
Well, we scanned her.
There's no fluid in the abdominal cavity, but it's hard to tell with internal injuries.
Probably the best thing to do is to keep her quiet a few days and then watch.
I'm okay.
Really.
Believe it or not.
Are you okay?
Where's Janey?
She's fine.
She's outside.
I have to see her.
In a little while.
I look terrible.
No, silly.
Huh.
I was just driving along and, um, and Janey was singing "Kumbaya."
And, um, and then this car just started drifting across the four lanes on the expressway.
Like bouncing off cars and I just kept thinking this is so weird.
I'm sorry.
Shh.
[whimpers]
Shh.
[telephone rings]
Who's left?
Hello.
- Hi, Gary.
- Hi, Gary.
You know, um, she's okay.
No, no, actually we got things pretty much in hand.
Um, Elliot's trashing the kitchen.
Janey did that.
Uh, no.
No, she was on the expressway, and some idiot lost control and he bounced off the guard rail.
Yeah, really.
Tell me about it.
Um, yeah sure.
Okay.
Nah, you know what?
Actually it would be better if you came tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, I'll tell her.
All right, thanks.
[sighs]
If I have to tell that story one more time...
Ah, print up a detailed account and be sure to include how I spent 20 bucks on cab fare from the hospital.
[telephone rings]
Hello.
Hi, Mom.
[Michael] Uh, oh, right.
Right, uh.
[Janey] Hi, Mom.
You know, uh, actually, before we talk about flight times.
Um, Hope was in a small accident today.
No, no, no.
Mom, Mom, she's okay.
She okay.
Yes, she has to stay in bed.
Yeah, no, no, Mom.
We just have to keep an eye on her.
Hey, pal.
Hi, Nance.
She's okay.
She okay?
Go see Janey's rabbit for a minute.
- She's on pain killers.
- What kind?
[Michael] Yes, Mom, Janey was in the car
Janey was in the car, oh.
[Michael] Mom, Mom?
She wasn't hurt at all.
No, they just want to make sure that there are no internal injuries.
Is the car like all smashed up?
Can I see it?
Yeah, you know what, Mom?
I hate to say it, but, I think maybe your right.
Dad, are you coming for Christmas or not?
Well, uh--
Well, sure, I guess.
Or maybe we can do our own Christmas thing.
You know, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'll tell her.
I can't believe you just said that.
Your the one who always says not to lie to him.
Right, so then you make him a promise you have no intention of keeping.
[Michael] Yeah, okay.
We love you too, Mom.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hi, Mike.
Is it all right if I go up and just say hi.
Yeah.
* Where those sleigh bell * * ring-a-ling jing-jing-a-ling-a-ling, too *
[audience laughter on TV]
[TV show theme]
[Michael] Elliot, we're on a deadline, and you got us auditioning Santas for Ethan's Christmas pageant.
We're going bankrupt.
I know were going bankrupt.
Where's Hope?
She should have been home hours ago.
Elliot, there's a blizzard out there.
Mike, Mike, stop worrying and agonizing.
We got real problems here.
These Santas are terrible.
[laugh track]
Which means--
What's that?
- Oh, yes, yes.
- No, no, no!
No, no, no!
- Elliot.
- It's beautiful.
It's you.
- Elliot.
- I smell chestnuts roasting on the open fire.
- [sleigh bells ring]
- Elliot!
I hear sleigh bells?
[man] Excuse me, gentlemen.
You haven't seen several reindeer pass this way, have you?
Excuse me?
What a mess.
Someone is going to hear about this.
Um, too big.
Uh, too small.
If I don't hurry up,
I'll miss Belgium and Liechtenstein.
Excuse me, sir.
are you all right?
All right?
I'm a mess.
These television antennas are a mess.
You can't find a decent rooftop anywhere.
So I park on the street.
I'm in a house not five minutes, and my sleigh is being towed away.
I see a nice group of kids on the corner.
I ask for help.
Then next thing you know, they're stealing my clothes.
Good will to men, indeed.
[laugh track] [groans]
Elliot, that man needs help.
I'll say.
No, really, he's a sick man, Elliot.
We can't let him go wandering the streets out there.
- It's Christmas Eve.
- Exactly.
And we have one hour to get to Ethan's school.
We don't have time to get involve with some crazy man--
- Don't worry, I'll talk to him for a second.
- Michael!
[Elliot] Michael!
I don't know.
It was just weird see it, you know?
I mean I finally gotten to the point where I wasn't cringing every five minutes thinking about what could have happened.
But it didn't happen.
I know so everything is great.
It is great.
I know it's great.
That's why we're here.
You know you can come with me later?
Synagogue?
Ooh, serious business.
Come, Michael.
It's not serious.
It's actually kind of interesting.
You're kidding, right?
No, no, I was surprise myself.
Listen, last week Shelly Friedman, she roped me into one of those Friday night deals--
Well, I mean it's not a Springsteen concert.
But there was this-- I don't know, this kind of warm feeling.
And it's something to do on a Friday night.
And there's single men.
Michael, it's not like Hebrew school anymore.
I mean there were people there like us.
People who don't go to synagogue.
And this guy Markowitz, the rabbi, he's really smart.
And cute.
- Shut up.
- I mean-
- No.
Okay.
I mean you know last time I was in synagogue, and besides when dad died,
I think it was 1967 when Nate the janitor caught Alec Malasa slugging down the Manischewitz.
I mean, I don't know.
Hebrew school and all that.
You know, what did that have to do with Little League and the Beatles and getting girls to go to second.
I don't know you know.
At least it's more than that.
It's just stop making sense.
Do you believe in God?
I think we better get this done.
[Melissa] So what kind are we getting?
[Michael] What kind am I getting?
Are there different kinds?
I don't know, a big one.
Last chance to see Rabbi Markowitz.
No, thanks.
This is God's revenge for the time you planted a tree in Israel for Alfred E. Neuman.
Later.
[coughing] [water dripping]
Sweetie?
I'm fine.
I just feel a little dizzy.
[groans]
[kisses]
You're gonna pick up the phone, and you're gonna tell them what happened to you last night.
And if you don't do it, then I will.
Look, I just got dizzy.
I've been in bed for two days taking drugs and I got up to fast.
I'm already behind enough here, Michael.
Wait a minute.
You don't think you're going out today.
We are on the brink of a disaster here.
If I don't go out today we won't be ready.
Oh, Hope, forget the presents.
Forget the dinner.
And the first thing we have to do is go to the rental car place.
Look, Hope, I will get the stuff.
I'll make the dinner.
Michael, I can't let you do that.
I am fine, okay?
I want to do this.
I have to go out.
You know this thing scared me, too.
I just get--
Okay, okay, look.
All I need to do,
I need to get the stuff for the turkey and the stuff for the stuffing, okay?
And the chairs, all right?
The chairs you're gonna get from Elliot.
- Yeah
- You know we can have, like, a really convincing simulation of a Christmas dinner here.
A Christmas dinner, Janey, huh?
Won't that be nice with candles and holly?
And I can bake bread and cookies and--
Honey?
I'll drop you off.
[Elliot] So, you know, it becomes, like, this really big fight.
Howie Sulaski telling me there's no such thing as Santa Claus.
And I say there is.
And he says,
"What, is he like Superman, flying down people's chimneys and stuff?
"What is he, invulnerable?"
So the guy ties together three cherry-bombs, and he puts a trip wire in our chimney.
How late are stores open on Christmas Eve?
So my dad, Christmas Eve, goes to light a fire.
Blows a 3-foot hole in our roof.
[laughs]
Ethan, is your dad telling the truth?
Yeah, there's no such thing as Santa Claus.
What?
What are you talking about?
Hey, hey, did you do that?
Whoa, buddy, that's really cool.
What, did he get hit by an anti-aircraft here?
That's great.
You still gonna be an artist when you grow up?
He got hit by a heat seeking.
[vocalizes]
Ethan, Ethan, watch out.
Watch out, there's people working.
Sorry.
Ethan.
Howie Sulaski, huh?
So you have a history consorting with Jews.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I have a lot of admiration for the Jewish race.
Their warmth.
Their infinite patience in face of adversity.
Yeah, the Jews have played a key part in my personal development.
- Really?
- Yeah, of course they killed our Lord, but I've forgiven them for that.
What role in your personal development?
I lost my virginity to Judy Saperstein.
Oh, yeah?
But you didn't marry her, did you?
No, you married someone of your own persuasion.
I would have married her, except for she dumped me for Gordon Birnbaum.
And, of course, they're happy now, right?
I mean, lighting candles on Friday night.
Not eating shellfish together.
No.
Actually, I heard they became Sikks and moved to an ashram in upstate Oregon.
[imitates dogfight]
I swear to you.
I'm outside of the synagogue last night.
I might as well heard voices.
"Michael, why did you do it?
"Why did you marry a shiksa?"
Hope isn't Jewish?
Thank you, Elliot.
No, you're right, Michael.
It's such a comfort that Nancy and I are the same religion.
Kind of a beacon for our marriage.
This holiday season, especially.
Are you gonna give me presents, even if you're not there for Christmas?
No way.
What are crazy?
What are you, nuts?
I mean-
- No, no, no.
Presents are for people who aren't being tickled.
Are you coming?
Are you?
- I don't know.
- You have to.
Look, your mom and I have to talk about it.
That's what you always say.
Well, that's because it's true.
[kisses]
Then you never do talk about it.
We will talk about it.
I promise.
I want to go home.
Look, I told you.
I don't get off work until 5.
Michael is gonna take you home.
I don't want Michael to take me home.
I don't have time to take you home now.
Then I'll go myself.
[sighs]
Ethan.
Ethan!
Ethan, come on.
[laughter on TV]
You brought this man home, and you don't know who he is or what's wrong with him?
Melissa, he need help.
He was all alone, and it's Christmas Eve.
Mike, the man is in his underwear.
They stole his suit.
Urg.
[car approaches]
That's her.
Oh, she's home.
Thank heavens.
Honey.
I didn't know you cared, Rudolph.
Shh.
- Where did you get that nose?
- Ask you husband.
[Michael] Where's my wife?
You didn't see her on the road, did you?
I can barely see the front of my car.
She's not here yet?
What am I gonna do?
She's lost in the snow.
I know it.
Now, Mike, look on the bright side.
She's probably out buying you a great present.
- Ugh.
- [laugh track]
Ah.Well, I'm calling the police anyway.
Well, we're gonna make the eggnog.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll drink it.
No, no, not without that nutmeg, you're not.
And I left it next door.
And, Elliot, don't you dare get drunk.
Nah, nah.
[laugh track, applause track]
- Dad?
Dad.
- [applause track]
Mr. Steadman, you look really neat.
Mr. Steadman?
Ha ha.
That's amusing.
I am not Mr. Steadman.
I am Mr. Kringle.
Yeah, sure.
You don't believe me, either.
There's no such thing as Santa.
Sometimes-- Sometimes--
Sometimes I think you're right.
Okay, if you're Santa, what do I want for Christmas?
A Silo-50 and shooting shells and Granny stickum caps.
My dad told you.
But I didn't tell my dad.
Because Billy has one, and you're gunfighters together, and you saw him break Mr. Foster's window and swore not to tell.
You are Santa.
[studio audience] Aww!
I know what else you want for Christmas, even though you haven't told a soul.
You do?
You want your parents to stop fighting all the time and go back to the way they used to be.
I don't think even Santa Claus could do that.
You'd be surprised what kind of presents good little boys get for Christmas.
Heavens!
Look at the time.
Run along and get your parents.
- You'll have to go.
- [applause track]
And you, young man.
What is it you would like for Christmas?
So, Eth, what are you going to get for Christmas?
I don't know.
Hmm.
You ever play gunfighters?
Hmm?
Like who can draw the fastest?
Gunfighters?
Does that come with Zapticon and Trypticon?
Never mind.
Are you Jewish?
Yeah.
How'd you know?
Jews have Hanukkah.
They get presents eight nights in a row.
Yeah, yeah, but not big ones.
They just get big ones the first night.
After that, it's like stuff from your aunt-- you know, pants and wallets.
Jews can't put lights on their house.
Hmm.
Well...
I'm glad I'm Christian.
That's good, Eth.
People should be glad they are what they are.
On Hanukkah, does everybody get presents together?
What do you mean?
Does everybody get presents together, like the moms and dads?
Yeah, they try to.
Your dad's dead.
Yeah.
Mine's separated.
Bye.
Goodbye, Eth.
[chattering]
[Man] Excuse me.
[rabbi] We will continue now with the Ma'ariv service on page 228.
[praying in Hebrew]
[door opens]
[Woman] Good night, Rabbi Markowitz.
[Markowitz] Good night.
Who's skulking outside my office?
Nobody.
So, Mr. Nobody, you want to come in and skulk?
No, really, I was just walking--
Hello.
Um...
Hi.
I'm terrible with faces.
Oh.
Uh...
I'm Michael Steadman.
I'm, um,
I'm not even a member here.
So get out.
We don't allow intruders here.
Melissa Steadman is related to you?
My cousin.
Such a talent, such a lovely girl.
Can't you get her to do something about that hair?
So, Michael Steadman, Melissa's cousin.
What can I do for you?
Nothing.
I was--
I was just skulking by.
Nonsense.
Everybody wants something-- advice on their love life.
I should say a prayer over a sick poodle.
So go ahead.
What can I tell you you won't like?
Nothing, really.
I was just in the neighborhood.
Just been a lot of years.
I, uh... just wanted to see how the place was doing.
Ah.
What do you mean, ah?
So how are we doing?
I don't know.
I was just walking though.
How do I know how you're doing?
We're doing fine.
[on stereo] * Hallelujah, hallelujah *
* Hallelujah, hallelujah *
* For the Lord God-- *
Hello!
* ...reigneth *
* Hallelujah, hallelujah *
* Hallelujah, hallelujah *
Hope!
Hi, sweetie.
[babbling]
Janey, what is it?
Honey.
** ["Hallelujah Chorus" continues]
- Honey.
- Honey.
Are you okay?
Michael, I'm sorry.
Okay, okay.
What's this?
You're supposed to tell us.
This is a fine way to start the day.
What are you doing back here?
I couldn't stay away.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Okay, let's see here.
Uh, no badness so far.
- Any more vomiting?
- Mm-mm.
That's good.
What can I tell you?
According to this, you're still fit.
And we're going to do more useless and painful tests just to be sure.
I just don't understand what this could be.
Well, Hope, some part of your body is clearly still reacting from the trauma.
Now, it isn't inner ear.
It isn't concussion.
In other words, you have no idea.
Correct.
Can I go home?
Yeah, sure.
I don't see any point in keeping you around here.
But let's just get through this last group of indignities, okay?
Yeah.
Thanks.
[knocking]
So how's Hope?
Ah, she's resting.
She's waiting for test results, going crazy.
Fine.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.
Are any of those for me?
Uh, huh, let me see.
Uh, this is, uh, for you.
- Ooh.
- [Nancy] Oh, boy.
- Right there.
You sit here.
- Come here.
This one is for you, Eth.
- [Elliot] Ooh.
- [Nancy] Here, sweetie.
Great.
- [Elliot] All right.
- Hey.
That's good.
All right, this one's for Nancy.
Thanks.
That's great.
Oh, that's-- that's nice.
Oh, gee, Elliot.
Um, hmm.
- Hmm.
- Ah, that's great.
- No, no, no.
That's great.
- Wait, wait.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Here you go.
It's the bill for the recording session you double-booked
- and we couldn't pay for.
- No, it's not.
Oh!
All right!
Courtside!
- All right.
- Elliot.
- Oh, man!
Oh, thanks.
- Thanks, Mike.
This is great.
I know you didn't pick it out, but tell Hope thanks.
Here.
Don't open it in the car.
Thanks.
Thank you.
All right.
Well, ahh.
Yeah, listen.
I better be going, too.
No.
No, hey.
Come on, Ethan.
You know--
Ethan, we-- Ethan, we talked--
Hey, Ethan, come on.
Hey, li-
- Pal, we talked about this.
Come on, you're a big guy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoa.
You're a big guy.
Now come on.
You understand, right?
Right?
Right.
You know I love you, right?
I love you, too.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, c-
- Shh.
Don't cry.
Nancy, I got to go.
I should have been home an hour ago.
- I think probably Hope's worried about--
- Okay.
You're going to have a great Christmas.
Best one ever.
Oh, that's a big hug.
Oh, I love you.
Hope?
Hope?
Hope?
[weatherman on TV] Look out, Delaware Valley.
Some winter white is heading in our direction.
Yes, a little holiday snow is in the forecast.
You folks up in the Poconos could get as much as 5 inches out of this system.
Here in Center City and throughout Osborn, Bryn Mawr, and the greater northeast, anywhere from-- ** [sitcom bridge]
Oh, my Lord.
Oh, no!
- Just part of the family.
- [laugh track]
You better hurry, Mr. Kringle, or we'll be late.
Eth, come on.
We're going to be late for the pag--
What are we playing, musical costumes here?
Mike, come on.
We're going to be late.
Elliot, I have something to tell you, and I think you better sit down.
- We'll sit at the pageant.
- Elliot--
Michael, I promised the committee that I'd supply the--
- Elliot!
- What?
This is Santa Claus.
The Santa Claus.
Mr. Kringle.
St. Nick.
[laugh track]
How do you do?
Mike, could you possibly have your nervous breakdown tomorrow?
We're very busy tonight.
Elliot, I mean it.
[laugh track] [jingling]
Ah.
St. Nick, eh?
All right, Saint, when I was 13, what did I get for Christmas?
Oh, my, that's very difficult.
It's been so many years.
Mike, hurry up and change.
Elliot, I'm telling you--
Elliot, ohh!
And I thought you were just being pig-headed.
- Huh?
- It's guaranteed spotless, it has its own china cycle, and even matches our Formica!
- Oh!
- Elliot, you bought her a dishwasher?
Oh, Elliot.
[stammering]
Yes, yes.
Well, honey, you know,
I've always had your interests at heart.
Oh, I guess you have, sweetie pie.
Lover boy.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
What is-- [gasp]
You didn't.
[laugh track]
You didn't.
Oh, Lord, you didn't.
You did!
You did!
Look at the fins!
Look at the chrome wheels!
Oh, my.That is the most beautiful Thunderbird
I've ever seen in my life.
Oh, honey.
Honey, I guess we really do need to believe in each other more.
Oh, I guess we do.
- Oh.
- [studio audience] Aw!
By the way, don't hold me to this, but wasn't it the Captain Marvel Secret Decoder set?
[laugh track]
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
[laugh track]
What about Hope?
She's out there in the snow somewhere.
If you're really Santa Claus, can you tell me where she is?
Can you tell me when she's coming back?
I'm sorry, my friend.
Hope is never coming back.
[Swiss bell ringers on TV]
Hi.
Here you go, sweetie.
Oh, you're getting so big.
Okay, you get down.
There you go.
- There you go, honey.
- [Janey chuckles]
There you go, sweetheart.
Thank you for going to the store with me.
- Yes.
- Where were you?
There you go.
Good girl.
Thanks, sweetie.
[Janey murmurs]
Oh, I know.
I know.
But-
- But I was feeling fine, and I realized we hadn't gotten cranberries, so--
Hope, you were not supposed to go out.
Michael, honey--
Look, if there is something wrong with you and you are waiting for test results, then you are not supposed to go out because--
- Michael, listen--
- No, no, no.
Because--
Because I see you out there and you're dead on the highway, only this time it's true because you're bleeding inside and you're fainting.
And I see Janey, and she's in the car, and I see her lying in a ditch, and I c--
Oh, Michael, Michael, Michael.
- Oh-- [laughing]
- What?
- Oh.
- What?
Why are you laughing at me?
Honey, oh...
I'm not dying.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, Hope, baby.
[door opens]
[Melissa] Knock, knock, knock.
It's Hanuklaus!
Happy Pagan Ritual, everybody!
What?
Mikey, you're pregnant.
It's so great.
I know.
You're not happy?
Of course I am.
Don't I look happy?
I'm incredibly happy.
It's just-
- It's just--
It's just, uh...
Uhh.
Never mind.
Michael.
Hope has this accident, and it makes me realize how much-- how incredibly much I love her.
I mean, it's, like, scary.
And-
- And then--
And then she's not dying.
She's pregnant.
Oh.
Oh.
So we can have this wonderful life.
I can give her everything she wants, like Christmas.
I can make her happy.
So what's the problem?
The problem...
The problem is I believe in God.
I didn't think I did, but I think I do.
And I just, uh...
I-
- I mean, what?
You know, I mean-- [sigh]
My father, he believed in God.
He didn't have a problem.
But then he didn't marry a non-Jew.
And he got divorced.
Michael, what are you trying to say?
Are you saying that because you didn't marry into your religion, you can't believe in God?
No, no, no.
No, but-- but which God?
Who God?
Where God?
I mean--
It's like almost losing Hope.
It makes me want to--
Makes you want to what?
[water running]
Hello?
[Markowitz] Hello.
I'll be right out!
Who is it?
It's Michael Steadman.
Who?
Michael Steadman.
[Man] Wait a minute.
I can't hear with the water running.
How are you doing?
What's up?
Nothing.
I, uh, I was looking for Rabbi Markowitz.
You found him.
No, no.
I guess, uh,
I guess I mean the other Rabbi Markowitz.
There's a frightening thought.
Two of me.
Really, what can I do for you?
Nothing.
Oh, man.
Uh, I'm sorry.
I-
- I, you know,
I, uh, I guess I was looking for somebody else.
[thump]
[praying in Hebrew, muffled]

SURVEY MAP OF A PARADISE LOST
Hello?
Hi, I finally got through...
How old are you?
Your age?
Your age?
What's it got to do with you?
Well, if I don't know your age how am I supposed to come up with suitable topics to talk about?
Okay then, I'm 1 7.
- Are you pretty?
- Yeah, I am.
Do you wanna fuck me?
Things related to me... completed.
Things related to surroundings...
society... completed.
The end.
Currently in the telephone club...
How are you getting on with that phone club article?
I'm wondering whether to go and see it for myself.
You believe in experiencing everything don't you?
How can you write about something without experiencing it?
If we tried everything we wrote about, we'd be in prison by now.
But if you want to go, I'II introduce you to an interesting girl there.
- Where?
- The phone club.
- hello?
- Hello?
Hello...
hello?
What's going on?
- hello?
- I'm Midori, member no. 33.
Midori?
You're the girl Kato told me about?
- You're Mr Nukada, right?
- Can I meet you somewhere?
- I'll be right with you.
- What's that?
hello?
Weren't you expecting me?
Er... not so soon... but...
where have you just come from?
The office.
Ah...
I see.
I thought you were calling from an outside line.
Here.
- So what do you normally do here?
- Nothing special.
- This and that?
- Yeah.
I'm just a student.
Do you sometimes date the clients?
No, I don't.
But if there's no girls around, I'II fill in for them.
fill in?
I pretend that I'm calling from somewhere else.
Faking it...
How do you write Midori?
Men are always asking me that.
Hoshikawa...
Midori.
What's your real name?
Don't be silly.
I don't use an alias.
That's strange.
I thought you'd use a different name.
You think it's strange, right?
Yeah, most of the girls use fake names.
- But I don't bother.
- Are you a member then?
A member of the club?
No, I'm not.
But you just gave your member number on the phone.
Oh, that...
I just made it up.
(Onyanko Club used member numbers)
I see.
Did you also answer the first call and then hang up?
Yeah, the lines get crossed sometimes.
It causes us a Iot of trouble.
I see.
So that's what happened earlier.
You gonna date me for my article?
- I promised Mr Kato.
It's cool.
- Ready?
Get in.
Hey, who're you?
- I booked her before you.
Get in.
- Hey!
That's business for you!
Hey!
Hey wait.
I'm interviewing her.
I've already made an appointment.
only a journalist.
Wait!
Sorry.
I'm not into perverts.
I'm having my period.
That's why I want to do it.
I want to taste your blood.
You're like dracula.
Hey, what do you do?
Huh?
Where do you work?
Didn't I tell you last time?
Maybe I forgot because of the strange things you did to me.
NDT. com.
That's a really big company.
Who cares?
AII I do is type C into a computer.
That's cool.
Huh?
You don't deal with people.
I find men who handle machinery super-cooI.
Is that so?
I think that's why you're into such strange things.
So the other men don't do anything strange?
I don't know.
I've only had sex with you.
only me?
I meant at the Banana club.
But why?
When you called me, I felt like making love.
You felt like it...
I see.
- Hey.
- Huh?
You see that dell over there?
Yeah.
Yumiko Okada threw herself from the top of that building.
Ah... that pop star.
I heard about it.
I was working there when it happened.
I heard the noise.
Like a boom...
It was quite a soft noise.
I was serving someone who wanted a salmon lunch and a seaweed lunch.
"What's that?" I wondered, and noticed a red stain on my dress.
I wondered what had happened then someone screamed.
But it wasn't really a scream.
It was more like someone going "Aaah"
in a small voice.
Then I Iooked outside and she was Iying there, covered in blood.
When we die, we're all the same.
She was Iying there, with her arms and legs spread, covered in blood.
She was beautiful.
beautiful?
It was so sexy.
You're a strange girl.
I felt hot.
I shuddered.
Then I began having a dream where it was me that had jumped.
I hit my head on the concrete, as if I did it often, but I didn't feel any pain.
I'm supposed to be dead but I'm just watching the blood that's gradually pooling around me.
Then I find myself sleeping like this in the morning.
So when you have that dream, it gives you the hots?
Can I have a phone call, please?
A seaweed lunch and a salmon lunch.
I don't know why I remember such things.
It's so nice and cool here.
This is the Naittei Detective Agency.
I've got some pictures ready for you.
If you're in a hurry, I can fax them through to you.
Ah, yes... if you would.
- Is your fax ready to receive?
- Yes.
Don't do anything weird.
You've been so rough lately and the marks aren't fading.
Itchy...
Hey, get me the pills.
You should stop taking those pills.
They'II kill you.
Itchy...
I'm so itchy.
Itchy.
I'm so itchy.
No!
I'm so itchy.
Scratch...
Let me scratch...
Stop it.
Untie me...
It's NDT. com.
I'm sorry to bother you, but your phone is being tapped.

THEOREM OF DEATH
This is the estimation calculated from the inputted data...
Today, around 8pm, police received a report that 2 bodies had been found at a love-hotel in Shinjuku.
The police discovered the couple's blood-soaked bodies in a bathroom.
The man, who was announced dead at the scene has been identified as Norio Kihara, an employee for NDT. com.
He was 29 years old.
The woman, who cannot be named is a 1 7 year-old student from a private Tokyo high school.
She suffered massive blood loss, but her condition is reported to be stable.
- What's up?
- Nothing really.
I've heard an interesting rumor.
There's a video of it.
The death at the Iove-hoteI.
- Midori's hotel?
- That's right.
What do you mean?
apparently, Kihara was filming himself and Midori having sex and ended up taping the entire incident.
- The murder?
- That's right.
Where is it?
- The police are holding it as evidence.
- Can we see it?
I don't think that's possible.
Can't you speak to your contacts?
You've got to get hold of it!
well, Iet me think...
Excuse me.
I'm Nukada, a friend of Kihara.
How can I help you?
It was so shocking and sudden and I was passing by.
I came to see how you are.
could I present an incense stick to his ashes?
I'm afraid I don't have them.
He didn't agree with presenting incense or displaying pictures after death.
- I'm very sorry
- Ah, I see.
How did you know Kihara?
well... we used to go drinking together.
Are you feeling alright?
It's a copy.
apparently, Kihara was tapping phone conversations in the office.
- Did you know that?
- Tapping?
Yeah...
I was doing a bit of snooping and came across a juicy bit of gossip.
NDT has been getting a Iot of attention since its stock went up so much so they've covered it up somehow to avoid ruining their reputation.
But apparently, someone was nearly for the chop.
What exactly was he listening to?
I don't know.
But Nukada, why are you so involved with this case?
If you're worried because you talked to Midori, you have nothing to do with it.
No.
Please stop it.
I'll erase it later, nobody else will see it.
It's not about being seen.
I just don't like being recorded.
You'II enjoy watching it after.
- It's the real thing, not made up.
- You do some strange stuff.
What's wrong with that?
You'II enjoy watching all the kinky stuff you'II be doing.
I'm going home.
You had that dream again, didn't you?
That's why you called the Banana club and coincidentally it was me who answered.
It seems like we're connected somehow.
Something's not right.
Why is it always you that takes my call?
There's a secret.
It's called tapping.
I tweaked the company's equipment to do it.
Every time you call the Banana club, I can pick up the call.
Why would you do such a thing?
First of all, I Iike your voice.
secondly, I Iike your face.
I can see in your face that you're not the type who takes life too seriously.
And I Iike your body.
However much I hurt it, it bounces back.
Stop being selfish.
I let you do it because I thought it was exciting.
But I don't want to do any more strange stuff.
I know you Iike the strange stuff.
Even though you pretend not to.
Stop it!
It's hurts!
It's too late.
The adult video has begun.
Why?
Why do you do such things?
I didn't expect you'd say things like that.
You usually act so cool.
Huh?
New generation girl?
- I'm not Iike that.
- Then what are you?
Are you scared?
Say something.
I thought you wanted to die.
You're someone who wants to die, right?
You're looking for a place to die, right?
Huh?
Am I wrong?
If you want to die... then die.
Which large canal was built first?
The Panama or the Suez?
- Contestant 1?
- The Suez.
That's right, the Suez Canal was built first in 1869.
Homo Neanderthalensis is believed to have lived in the Stone Age...
hello, editorial room.
Nukada.
Line 1 for you.
hello?
hello?
Yes, that's right.
Midori...?
Oh, it's you!
Midori Hoshikawa.
What's wrong?
Where are you?
Well, the media won't leave me alone.
- I'm the media too.
- I know you, so that's OK.
I had to speak to so many people that I didn't know so I felt like speaking to someone I knew.
That's cool.
There's something I wanted to ask you too.
I'm not supposed to go too far because I'm under police surveillance.
You'II be OK.
We're almost there.
We're heading to Kihara's house.
Ready?
Watch carefully.
So you two knew each other.
What's that?
Kihara must have used the same videotape to record all his movies.
But you can still see some of the earlier stuff that wasn't taped over.
You only see it for a couple of frames.
Watching the tape under normal circumstances, you'd never catch it.
I discovered it purely by accident.
Ha...
I'm impressed.
Then?
Then?
That's what I want to ask you.
Did the victim's wife know the woman who may have killed him?
So Kihara knew.
He knew we were in touch, he was taping us.
Why?
I don't know.
She asked me to kill him.
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
What do you mean?
Kihara started getting rough with her during sex.
Her scars and bruises weren't fading, so she began to resent him.
She wanted to divorce Kihara, but he wouldn't accept it.
Then she found out about me.
She got my number from a detective agency and called me.
She's lying!
She called me and said "Kihara seems to be stalking you.
"Why not help me kill him?"
And she said because I'm under 18 the police would treat it as seIf-defense.
So.
You created a situation where you could kill him in seIf-defense.
Sort of.
You had no reason to kill Kihara.
Yeah, you're right.
But is that true?
He was too persistent.
For him, things he found exciting yesterday were still exciting today.
That's why he always did the same things over and over.
That's a bad mistake!
Yesterday, today and tomorrow are all totally different days.
But he thought everyday was the same.
I hate that!
Why is it fixed?
Who decided that?
You killed him because you don't like doing the same thing twice?
I don't know.
He killed himself.
Kihara suddenly turned into a violent person.
I couldn't take it anymore.
He started doing all kinds of perverted things.
To heal my body, I took a Iot of drugs.
And every time the drugs wore off, it started to itch.
It's so itchy and I can't stand it.
You like the kinky stuff, don't you?
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'm itchy.
please scratch me.
So itchy... itchy... scratch it!
I'm itchy... so itchy!
Scratch me!
I'm itchy!
Scratch me!
Where'd you get the camera?
I had it in the car.
- I was going to tape you.
- For the interview?
No, for my hobby.
So I'II be in your home movies then?
I want to jump.
Do you mean fly in the sky?
I told Kihara about it once.
- Can you tell me?
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Then... will you be able to tell me after you jump?
I don't know.
I see.
I'II tell you, Mr Nukada.
Then I'II watch the video after you've told me.
Huh?
Your video.
Aren't you going to tell the police?
I don't think I saw the truth hidden in a couple of frames.
It was a dream.
Mr Nukada, I think you fancy me.
Why?
Because I'm pretty.
I'm ill.
I found out 6 months ago.
It's terminal.
That's alright.
I decided to input all the data about myself into this computer.
And it figured out that suicide is best for me.
But I'm quite a coward and I can't kill myself.
So I've chosen some people who have a better chance of killing me.
If you haven't begun to unravel things before you see this video this won't make any sense to you.
But if you've discovered what's going on at the beginning of the tape.
then it'll probably make sense to you.
It could be important to you.
This is the truth.
I committed suicide.
I killed myself.
Understand?
Why am I sending you this video?
It's because you're a journalist.
I'm sending you the curse of the dead.
I've spread my illness sufficiently.
I've destroyed myself.
Farewell.
You're Satoshi Nukada.
Right?
What do you want?
You attempted to hide the truth from us.
What crime have I committed?
We'll think about it, look through the laws and come up with something.
You bugged the Kihara house.
That's a criminal violation.
By the way, I can give you some information you don't have.
The results for Kihara's post mortem have been announced.
Kihara was tested HIV+.
AIDS?

I think you should make Christmas presents, Ulla.
At least for Sofie.
Poor Sofie.
She doesn't have much space.
There's no room for me.
Sit still, Rulle.
When are you going to learn?
You ought to be more grateful.
What if we had to live with Sofie?
We would starve to death.
That's what aunt Louise says.
Don't cry, Rulle.
I didn't mean it like that.
I only want to help you.
You know how angry aunt Louise gets if we don't behave.
Look.
You can give these to aunt Louise for Christmas.
We'll pretend that you made them.
I've made something else, you see.
What a mess!
You're not dressed.
Do you know what time it is?
Get dressed at once and come down to the dining room.
Do you understand?
- Yes, aunt Louise.
- And clean up this mess.
I'm about to give up.
No, Ole.
It doesn't work.
We have to do something with the child.
She doesn't listen to me.
I can't stand it any longer.
The child has to understand.
Isn't there an orphanage or a boarding school?
I can't be responsible anymore.
Look, we don't eat.
I give up.
- Louise...
- Eat your food or straight to bed.
Don't be sad, Kamilla.
Aunt Louise is doing her best.
I know, but do I have to go to a boarding school?
No, you're too small.
I'll think of something.
- I've got a plan.
- Me too.
- I'm buying a present for Louise.
- Can you afford that?
I've been saving.
- Don't you have anything better?
- This is basically it.
- No thanks.
- Don't you want a tree?
Was that my fault?
I need some money.
Just some coins.
I'm only asking for a little bit.
Have mercy on your father.
I've told you that we need the money for something else.
Go home.
- I understand.
- Yes?
- I want that tree.
- That one?
You think that aunt Louise wants a big tree?
- How much is that?
- That'll be 2 kroner.
- Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
What on earth is that?
We haven't ordered a tree.
Put it outside.
And Ole, make sure you burn it tomorrow.
Get in.
Hurry!
Kamilla!
My dear niece.
I'm writing to you in secrecy this time.
Our home was probably never the right place for your little sister.
You know Louise.
She has never been good with children.
Now Louise is planning to send her away.
Far away to a boarding school for young girls in Denmark.
I know you don't have much room and can't provide for two people.
But in order to help all of us in a difficult situation, -
- I want you to find a little house for yourself and Kamilla.
It would be best for Kamilla to start school in the countryside.
With you.
Good morning.
- Nice weather today.
- Yes, I know.
No, we won't get Christmas pudding tonight.
Good morning, Sebastian.
It's my birthday today.
Happy birthday.
How old are you?
- 10 years.
- Are you that old?
Look out, you big jerk!
- Who is that man?
- One of your workers.
To the factory.
Quickly.
You're still here, Mr Kåk?
The working hours are over.
I had to finish this one.
There.
Look.
You're fired, mr Kåk!
Fired?
Since you're still here, come with me to the office.
The dismissal papers are ready.
Hey, where's the rent?
I asked you a question.
Where's the rent?
- Dear Mrs Hansen...
- Do you think I'm blind and deaf?
Don't you think I see what you spend my rent on?
I have eight small children to provide for.
You ought to be ashamed.
Eight small children to take care of.
I can't wait forever.
Sebastian, my son, will take care of it.
He has a job.
- He's even getting paid today.
- This is Thursday.
There you have it.
You'll get every coin I owe you, Mrs Hansen.
Today.
Last warning.
I must have the money tomorrow.
Pretty clever...
What do you want?
The master asked me to finish packing for you tonight.
Am I leaving?
Don't you know?
You're going to a boarding school in Aarhus.
Kamilla!
Hush.
- What about aunt Louise?
- Leave her to me.
Where am I going?
- To Sofie.
- Sofie!
I've saved it for you.
Your mother gave it to me.
Right before she died.
There...
Get going before aunt Louise wakes up.
Ole, what are you up to?
There, there...
Everything will be fine.
You better wait here.
I think the station master has found you a nice train.
Be a nice girl and wait for them.
That's my bag!
Come on!
Get him!
Come on!
- There!
Take him!
- Come on!
No, no!
Let go!
I don't want to!
No!
Let go of me!
Are these your things?
Your stockings?
Your bag?
Is he yours as well?
- Where is your mommy?
- I don't have a mommy.
- I don't either.
- Mommy is in heaven.
So is mine.
- I'm taking the train to Engstad.
- To Engstad?
But that isn't leaving until four o'clock.
That's much to long for a little girl like you.
I'm going to America.
A far away country.
- By train to America?
- First by train, then by boat.
But I have to go now.
You're welcome to come look at my train.
I'll get you for that.
Get lost!
Run in there.
Did you miss your train?
I'm a bit hungry.
Is he hungry as well?
I have a loose tooth.
Yes, it is loose.
Buy that Christmas pudding.
Here you go.
Sebastian!
Why aren't you at the factory today?
- My Christmas pudding!
- Did you want it?
Daddy was buying it for me.
He's getting paid today.
Here, Oliver.
Don't you want it?
Say that you got it from a rich lady.
- I'm not rich.
- But I am.
I'm loaded.
Now I'm taking you to a place where you've never been.
- Where is that?
- A restaurant.
But we can't go in these clothes.
We have to go home and change.
I have an idea.
Come on.
- Aren't we going that way?
- No.
We'll go another way.
- Nice table.
- Something to drink?
Please.
What do you want to drink?
- Milk.
- Yes, milk...
Sweet or sour?
Cold or hot?
- I'd rather have juice.
- Strawberry or raspberry?
- Apple juice or orange juice?
- Yes.
One raspberry juice, one strawberry juice, one orange juice, one apple juice, and a big glass of cold milk?
Thank you.
Why, I've never...!
Give me the police.
Quickly.
Enjoy.
Eat.
It's salmon!
Do I have to eat everything?
You're not full already?
Do you want to taste?
It's really good.
No.
Did you like it?
- What is it?
- Some russian stuff.
What is it?
I got a really bad tummy ache.
- Finish up.
We have to go.
- Aren't you going to pay?
Do we do that here?
Pssst!
- Let's go.
- What about all the food?
Come on.
Excuse me.
An important message from the office.
What?
A burglary at my place?
I beg your pardon, Miss Hose.
I'll be right back.
- Look, Sebastian.
A real car!
- It's only a Buick.
Can't we look at the car?
- You've never been to a restaurant.
- Not that one.
Hurry up.
- Are you really rich?
- We have to make the train!
Why were you afraid of that man?
Look!
- Mommy had one of those.
- Do you like the book?
- Kamilla.
Kamilla?
- What is that?
There you go.
It's for you.
- Thank you!
- Now, now...
Hurry up!
Hurry!
- When is the next train?
- Not until tonight.
- I'm sorry.
- What is it now?
I didn't mean to hold you back.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just that...
We stayed too long at the restaurant.
You'll get there.
Even if we have to walk the whole way.
Who's your new friend, Kamilla?
is it someone you can trust?
is it someone who can hold your hand?
when the road ahead seems hopelessly long night is coming soon, Kamilla the sky will get dark and full of stars and you need someone to hold your hand
you still have a long way to go
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend that you can trust?
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend that you can trust?
Do you want a potato?
You didn't see my little sister on the train?
Not as far as I know.
- Don't you want a ride?
- No thanks.
I have to get back.
Alright.
Do you know that a little spark can start a big fire?
My father blew up mountains and rocks with these little sparks.
But one day a big rock landed on him, and he became a cripple.
I had to take care of myself.
And my mom...
She died in prison right after.
She wanted to steal some bread for me and my sister.
Still the police locked her up in a nasty, cold, mouldy basement.
She was cold.
She became sick.
That's what I'm most afraid of in the whole world.
But we go to heaven.
- We do?
- Mommy and daddy are there.
They're probably eating with your mommy.
Afterwards they run around barefoot in soft grass.
And they sleep in hammocks with nice lions and bunnies.
- Lions don't bite in heaven.
- There are no cold prisons there.
No, because nobody has to steal.
I think the shop could have given your mother some bread.
I hope I don't end up in a dark, lonely hole like that.
- Did you steal something?
- Shush.
Shush.
Wait here.
What's a young lady doing all alone in the woods at this time of night?
And what's the young lady doing in my berry spot?
What a nice watch.
Real gold.
I see we have company?
No, don't get up.
There should be plenty of food for everyone.
Are you taking a walk in the woods?
I sell merchandise to the farms.
What kind of merchandise?
This and that.
Different things.
And I play for people.
- Good!
Could you play for us?
- Yes.
Kamilla, that sack is full of stolen silverware.
The sheriff is probably looking for him.
Kamilla...
Kamilla, that sack is full of stolen silverware.
We have to get away.
Nice.
As a thank you I'll give you this one.
Well played, but we've had enough of the forest.
- So we better get...
- No.
You don't fool Joakim Jensen.
You're going straight to the sheriff to report me.
- Why would we go to the sheriff?
- To claim the reward.
There is a big reward for whoever catches Joakim Jensen.
Just stay there.
We can eat now.
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
- What is it?
- The money!
He stole all the money last night.
My gold watch!
Maybe you ought to send a telegram to your uncle.
Do you think uncle Ole could have changed his mind?
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la
Kamilla Pytten is my name and I'm really very happy
I'm getting a home of my own when we get there
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian is my name and even though my life is hard and the road is long and heavy I'll sing a little song
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la we have no more money we're not rich anymore what's waiting behind the next turn nobody knows but we take comfort in our song listen to the nice sound we're walking and singing together as friends the two of us
two friends we are tra-la-la-la-la-la-la two friends we are tra-la-la-la-la-la
Sofie!
Sofie!
- Sofie!
- Kamilla.
Kamilla!
What happened?
- Where have you been?
- Sebastian followed me all the way.
- Sebastian?
- A rich man who helps children.
There was a thief in the woods.
He stole all his money.
And the nice medal that mommy gave me.
You're here at least.
Sebastian has to stay with us until he gets his money back.
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
Aunt Louise said that you couldn't afford to buy your own house.
If you made more money, Sebastian could stay with us.
- Are you going to prison?
- Why do you ask?
If you let Sebastian steal I won't tell anyone.
Silly girl.
Why should I steal?
- To buy this nice house?
- Do you think it's that nice?
Time to come out.
There.
Hurry up so you don't get cold.
There.
Are you going to prison?
Can you keep a secret?
- Uncle Ole gave me the money.
- Uncle Ole?
I feel sorry for him if aunt Louise finds out.
She'll run him up to the top of the flagpole.
You're kidding.
Aunt Louise doesn't have a flagpole.
But she'll serve him stewed rubble for dinner.
There.
I'm sure about that.
- Did you find your bed already?
- Is this my bed?
Come, I'll show you something.
There.
Look.
That's the picture that mommy gave you.
Did you find it?
Kamilla.
Kamilla.
Promise that you'll never leave with strangers again.
Promise.
The next time it could be someone who wants to trick you.
Do you understand?
- Rolly can't stay there.
- Rolly?
You're so dirty.
Go wash up.
Smells good.
Can I try?
If you're going to try there won't be much left for the wedding.
Are you starting at our school?
There's a mean boy in our class.
But don't worry about him.
Do you want to look at our sheep?
Get out.
Here, Kamilla.
There.
- What about the potatoes?
- I'll do them later.
- Come, Kamilla!
- Come on.
- There.
- Come on.
Do you want some?
It is nice to sit down and take a little rest.
- The children are busy down there.
- Nice.
We have rabbits as well.
Do you want to see them?
- What on earth...
- What a racket!
- Berta, hurry up!
- Christoffer!
- Christoffer, what is that thing?
- What is it?
- Stop!
You're scaring the animals!
- What is that?
- Isn't it one of those...?
- Christoffer!
- It could be dangerous.
Careful!
- Christoffer!
Christoffer!
Christoffer!
Do you think I want to run after you?
I do.
- What is that?
- What's he doing here?
- The horse!
- Stop the thief!
Help!
- Look at that man!
- Stop.
He's taking the horse!
Get the animals moving.
I think he stole a ham.
Come on.
- Look!
That's our horse.
- I'll kill him!
Look out!
There!
Come on.
Look!
Not bad.
It was probably the thief that we met in the woods.
Do you think that Sebastian is alone now?
He'll be ok.
Dear God.
You have to help the nice Sebastian Kåk.
Good night, Kamilla.
Her name is Kamilla Pytten.
She's starting with us.
She has come from town and is staying with her sister.
Maybe some of you already have gotten to know her?
Stand up, Peder.
I know where she lives.
Next to the haunted house.
You mean next to the Simen cottage.
We have to get started.
There's a seat next to Maren.
We'll stand and sing our morning song.
praise the Lord he is near when we're singing when we're praying we are gathered in his name he dwells in our midst...
Is it true that the Simen cottage is haunted?
People say that Simen, who used to own it, comes at night to look for his money.
Nobody wants to come here at night.
That's why nobody wanted this house.
Isn't it strange?
I've lived here for several months, and I still haven't seen a ghost.
We're busy at the farm now.
Otherwise you could have come with me.
I don't like you being alone.
There.
Can you carry all this?
- Yes.
- Can you?
Good.
Go straight home and lock the door.
You'll be safe.
- Good morning.
- But hurry up.
- I see you're keeping busy?
- A lot to do for the wedding.
That's where she lives.
I bet they have silverware there.
You don't touch that house.
I want that gold watch now.
Sit down.
Calm down.
I have a proposition.
You get the gold watch.
- I get the suit.
- The suit is worth more than that.
Alright.
But we share the money.
They're not yours.
- Did you forget?
- I was the one who nicked them.
Yes...
I nicked them as well.
From a rich man in the woods.
- We'll share.
- Fifty-fifty.
- Fifty-fifty.
- First the suit.
- Right?
- Right.
Then we're even.
The gold watch.
You have a lot to learn, kid.
See you later.
Sebastian!
- We'll jump with joy.
- Look what I brought you.
Why do you have the thief's clothes?
I had to swap clothes to get the watch.
- Is the thief still in the woods?
- Yes.
I saw him steal a ham at the farm.
Did you?
- What are you making?
- I just finished "Seven sisters".
"Seven sisters".
- Are you going to America?
- Me?
No, I still don't have enough money.
- You can stay with us.
- Sofie wouldn't like that.
Do you speak American?
Yes.
Seems pretty perilous.
- What does that mean?
- I need some new clothes.
Say some more.
Simsurium sari pam picnic.
That means that I need a razor.
- Are you saying that for real?
- I can't wear these rags.
No, you can't.
But we don't have any men's clothes.
Look at this.
Run to the store and get me some.
- Pants and a shirt as well?
- And a shaving kit.
But you can't say that it's for Sebastian.
- Why not?
- Nobody can know that I'm here.
It's a secret that only you and me share.
But what if they ask?
Say that you've gotten a visit from an uncle from America.
- Have I?
- At least a pretend uncle.
- Bye!
- Bye.
There's nothing in the paper these days.
There's something happening here, Sofie.
A criminal has escaped.
Did you hear that, Sofie?
A criminal has escaped from the town prison.
There's a picture of him.
Joakim Jensen.
And here's a picture of another one who is wanted.
- Sebastian Kåk.
- What did you say?
Look at this.
Joakim Jensen.
A dangerous criminal.
Just look at his eyes.
- Have you seen anything more spooky?
- It's him!
- Do you know him?
- I thought I had seen him.
What?
- It smells clean.
- Do you wash the clothes?
Sometimes.
It was too much money.
I got a ride with Big Peder and his granddad.
Everybody thinks that I have a guest from America.
Kamilla, I'm horribly tired.
Do you think I can borrow your bed?
- It's in there.
- But...
I have big problems falling asleep.
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
It's best if somebody sings to me while I fall asleep.
Can you do that?
- Say a prayer as well?
- Maybe some other time.
But don't open the door before I wake up.
I'll take a little nap.
- Hi.
- You have guests from America?
- What?
- That uncle of yours must be rich.
- Uncle?
What uncle?
- The American.
Kamilla got a ride from the store.
She told me all about it.
- Was he blonde?
- Don't know.
I didn't see him.
- You have to be quiet.
- Why?
- Guess.
- Is he here?
In there.
- Quiet.
Don't wake him up.
- Is he sleeping?
You scared me.
- I almost thought it was true.
- He was there.
- He even borrowed my bed.
- Nobody has been sleeping in it.
Look.
Here are his clothes.
You know what?
He had to swap with the thief to get the watch.
- Look.
- Kamilla.
- Sebastian is a thief.
- You're lying!
He's wanted by the police.
Listen to me!
Don't you understand?
He's dangerous.
You saw all his money.
- You're lying!
- He stole them from a factory.
- It's true.
- Sebastian has never stolen.
The police can't take Sebastian!
- Was he horrible?
- How did you chase him away?
- Did he steal anything?
- Mommy said he was big and scary.
- Did he have fangs?
- What did you tell him?
You must have said something.
Otherwise he would have hit you.
Thieves are cruel.
You're the bravest person at this school.
Kamilla is lying.
I bet she hid under the bed.
- Kamilla talked to the thief.
- She's lying.
If it was me I wouldn't have talked to him.
- I would just have kicked him out.
- You wouldn't dare.
I've talked to the king himself.
The king is nothing compared to a real thief.
I'm much more brave.
I'll throw a sandwich at the teacher.
Kamilla dares to eat with criminals.
But I dare to jump from the roof of the pigsty.
Kamilla dares to balance on the schoolhouse roof.
I sing the anthem outside the sheriff's window when he takes a nap.
Kamilla dares to sit alone in the Simen cottage at midnight.
She doesn't dare.
I bet 30 copper coins.
And I bet 35 coppers that she dares.
You dare, Kamilla.
Right?
I bet 5 coppers that she doesn't dare.
I bet 5 coppers that she doesn't dare.
- Me too.
- One krone that she dares.
She dares to!
I bet 3 coppers.
- I bet 10 coppers that she dares.
- I bet 30 coppers that she dares.
- I bet 3 coppers that she dares.
- I bet 7.
I bet she doesn't dare.
1 krone.
She's in for a big surprise.
Touch the ring if you like touch the ring touch your boy f riend if you like
- Aren't you going to eat?
- What time is it?
I don't know.
Almost 11 I think.
- Don't we have to go now?
- Yes.
Where are the others?
- It's 11 o'clock.
- I know.
Big Peder isn't here.
Only his mother and grandfather.
- Is he backing out?
- Coward.
Tell everyone that we're leaving.
No, you go.
It doesn't matter what you say.
You go first.
Are you going to open a restaurant?
She's sleepwalking.
Shush.
- Did she leave already?
- Shush.
I'm so small.
You're much bigger.
Can't you scare the ghosts?
- Ghosts!
- Shame on you for scaring us!
- It's something else!
- We've seen a ghost.
Stop that nonsense.
You're not allowed to cheat.
- She's in there.
- There's a real ghost in there.
Be quiet.
It's me.
Kamilla.
What are you doing?
- A bet.
- Are there more people coming?
- No.
- Did you make some kind of trap?
- Something else?
- No.
- You swear?
- We swear.
The thief!
Does he live here?
Promise not to come here again.
It's dangerous.
- I have to stay until midnight.
- What?
- Why?
- The bet.
If Joakim comes you have to be quiet.
Is it true that you're a thief?
You're the one who's been stealing from the farm.
- Yes.
- We could have given you food.
It's not that simple.
Be quiet.
Not one word.
Turn off the lamp.
There's a whole bunch of kids outside.
- You can't go out there.
- We have to keep watch.
Go to the window.
Who are you hiding in there?
- You can't go in there.
- Who is it?
Answer me.
- No!
Kamilla is in there.
- Kamilla?
And who opened the door for Kamilla?
Answer me.
- She got in on her own.
- Idiot!
Are you trying to get us arrested?
I know what to do.
Get going.
- Come.
You have to get out of here.
- You're bleeding.
It's nothing.
Is it bad if you loose that bet?
I'll tell you a story.
Have you heard about Groggen?
Why did you become a thief?
Not all thieves want to become thieves.
Not Joakim either.
But why do you steal?
Have you heard about Groggen?
He lived by the mines where my father worked.
Do you know where he lived?
On a hill of sand.
- What hill?
- One of those by the mines.
- On the floor?
- Yes.
He lived at the bottom.
One day he decided to go to America.
It's past midnight.
We have to rescue her.
He saw two tiny spots.
America.
But before they got there he looked into the water.
Are you all scaredy cats?
Big Peder is afraid of ghosts.
I'll go in alone.
- Mommy!
- But it's...
Kamilla!
She's dead.
Help, he's coming!
- Help!
- Help!
Kamilla?
Isn't she dead?
- Is she alive again?
- What was that?
- Was he horrible?
- Yes.
I'm hungry.
- Was he huge?
- Black and horrible.
Like that cat at the Salbakken.
And he had red eyes.
- Weren't you afraid?
- At first I was afraid.
And then I became more afraid.
And then I fell asleep.
Tell us more, Kamilla.
That's all.
Where on earth have you been?
- With Kamilla.
- At this time?
Kamilla!
Kamilla!
Kamilla, hi!
Kamilla!
Can you help me?
Hide this for a little while.
- You've been stealing at the farm.
- No, I haven't.
Quickly.
- Hi.
- He isn't here.
Don't be afraid.
Stand by the door.
He got away again.
Come on.
We're going to the woods.
Good morning.
I'm cleaning up my mess.
I've decided to move.
- To America?
- No.
Not exactly that far.
You don't have to move.
Look at this.
Thanks for forgetting this one.
Last night...
I...
I became a completely different Sebastian Kåk.
A different Sebastian Kåk?
I don't want to steal anymore.
Nice breeze today.
Do you want to make a kite?
- Are you going to stop stealing?
- Yes.
And if you have something good in your basket -
- I'll make you a kite with a tail and a veil.
Finish your bread.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
It's just luck that we have ham.
There's been so many thefts.
- Indeed?
- Burglaries...
- Again?
- While we celebrated the wedding all the silverware disappeared from Elvebakken.
They must have a hideout around here.
- Didn't the cook talk about ghosts?
- She's always talking about ghosts.
- She's right behind you.
- The Simen cottage is haunted.
Everybody says so.
Could you please pass the cheese?
There are ghosts there for real.
I've seen...
What have you seen?
Excuse us, but we need help.
We just saw the thieves outside the old smithy.
- We can get them now.
- Let's get them.
- I need more people.
- We're coming.
Now?
In the middle of the wedding breakfast?
Calm down, mother.
Can you hold this?
Can you hold it?
When I count to three, you let go.
One, two, three!
- We found him!
- Let's get him!
Come on!
I have to get my shotgun.
Here!
Come on!
They're leaving!
Kamilla, do you want to try?
Look!
Sebastian, look!
Come.
Kamilla, I think we'll try.
Run, Sebastian!
Let's try the kite.
- Run, Sebastian!
- Kamilla.
If the sheriff doesn't get me now, I'll stay a thief forever.
You'll die.
Kamilla.
I'll get out again.
Then I'll be free.
- Will you come here?
- If you and Sofie let me.
Let me go, so the sheriff can get me.
Look.
It's yours.
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
- Let the sheriff get him.
- It's the thief.
Sebastian Kåk?
- Take it easy.
- Sebastian.
Sebastian!
Kamilla!
Sebastian Kåk, you're under arrest.
Kamilla!
- Get it up!
- Higher!
- Higher.
- Look, Kamilla.
There's a message for you on the kite.
Can you see what it says?
Cry no more for me, Kamilla
I'll be back soon my life as a thief is over
I have to take the punishment I deserve and when I come back I'll be free we'll be waiting, Sebastian someday you'll be free it'll be a day with new possibilities
Kamilla, Kamilla I'll come back to you and I think that you'll receive me as a friend
who's your new friend, Kamilla?
is it someone you can trust?
is it someone who can hold your hand when the road seems long and hard soon night will fall, Kamilla the sky will be dark and full of stars and you need someone to hold our hand you still have a long way to go
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend you can trust?
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend who you can trust?
Atle Bjørge Scandinavian Text Service
I think you should make Christmas presents, Ulla.
At least for Sofie.
Poor Sofie.
She doesn't have much space.
There's no room for me.
Sit still, Rulle.
When are you going to learn?
You ought to be more grateful.
What if we had to live with Sofie?
We would starve to death.
That's what aunt Louise says.
Don't cry, Rulle.
I didn't mean it like that.
I only want to help you.
You know how angry aunt Louise gets if we don't behave.
Look.
You can give these to aunt Louise for Christmas.
We'll pretend that you made them.
I've made something else, you see.
What a mess!
You're not dressed.
Do you know what time it is?
Get dressed at once and come down to the dining room.
Do you understand?
- Yes, aunt Louise.
- And clean up this mess.
I'm about to give up.
No, Ole.
It doesn't work.
We have to do something with the child.
She doesn't listen to me.
I can't stand it any longer.
The child has to understand.
Isn't there an orphanage or a boarding school?
I can't be responsible anymore.
Look, we don't eat.
I give up.
- Louise...
- Eat your food or straight to bed.
Don't be sad, Kamilla.
Aunt Louise is doing her best.
I know, but do I have to go to a boarding school?
No, you're too small.
I'll think of something.
- I've got a plan.
- Me too.
- I'm buying a present for Louise.
- Can you afford that?
I've been saving.
- Don't you have anything better?
- This is basically it.
- No thanks.
- Don't you want a tree?
Was that my fault?
I need some money.
Just some coins.
I'm only asking for a little bit.
Have mercy on your father.
I've told you that we need the money for something else.
Go home.
- I understand.
- Yes?
- I want that tree.
- That one?
You think that aunt Louise wants a big tree?
- How much is that?
- That'll be 2 kroner.
- Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
What on earth is that?
We haven't ordered a tree.
Put it outside.
And Ole, make sure you burn it tomorrow.
Get in.
Hurry!
Kamilla!
My dear niece.
I'm writing to you in secrecy this time.
Our home was probably never the right place for your little sister.
You know Louise.
She has never been good with children.
Now Louise is planning to send her away.
Far away to a boarding school for young girls in Denmark.
I know you don't have much room and can't provide for two people.
But in order to help all of us in a difficult situation, -
- I want you to find a little house for yourself and Kamilla.
It would be best for Kamilla to start school in the countryside.
With you.
Good morning.
- Nice weather today.
- Yes, I know.
No, we won't get Christmas pudding tonight.
Good morning, Sebastian.
It's my birthday today.
Happy birthday.
How old are you?
- 10 years.
- Are you that old?
Look out, you big jerk!
- Who is that man?
- One of your workers.
To the factory.
Quickly.
You're still here, Mr Kåk?
The working hours are over.
I had to finish this one.
There.
Look.
You're fired, mr Kåk!
Fired?
Since you're still here, come with me to the office.
The dismissal papers are ready.
Hey, where's the rent?
I asked you a question.
Where's the rent?
- Dear Mrs Hansen ...
- Do you think I'm blind and deaf?
Don't you think I see what you spend my rent on?
I have eight small children to provide for.
You ought to be ashamed.
Eight small children to take care of.
I can't wait forever.
Sebastian, my son, will take care of it.
He has a job.
- He's even getting paid today.
- This is Thursday.
There you have it.
You'll get every coin I owe you, Mrs Hansen.
Today.
Last warning.
I must have the money tomorrow.
Pretty clever...
What do you want?
The master asked me to finish packing for you tonight.
Am I leaving?
Don't you know?
You're going to a boarding school in Aarhus.
Kamilla!
Hush.
- What about aunt Louise?
- Leave her to me.
Where am I going?
- To Sofie.
- Sofie!
I've saved it for you.
Your mother gave it to me.
Right before she died.
There...
Get going before aunt Louise wakes up.
Ole, what are you up to?
There, there...
Everything will be fine.
You better wait here.
I think the station master has found you a nice train.
Be a nice girl and wait for them.
That's my bag!
Come on!
Get him!
Come on!
- There!
Take him!
- Come on!
No, no!
Let go!
I don't want to!
No!
Let go of me!
Are these your things?
Your stockings?
Your bag?
Is he yours as well?
- Where is your mommy?
- I don't have a mommy.
- I don't either.
- Mommy is in heaven.
So is mine.
- I'm taking the train to Engstad.
- To Engstad?
But that isn't leaving until four o'clock.
That's much to long for a little girl like you.
I'm going to America.
A far away country.
- By train to America?
- First by train, then by boat.
But I have to go now.
You're welcome to come look at my train.
I'll get you for that.
Get lost!
Run in there.
Did you miss your train?
I'm a bit hungry.
Is he hungry as well?
I have a loose tooth.
Yes, it is loose.
Buy that Christmas pudding.
Here you go.
Sebastian!
Why aren't you at the factory today?
- My Christmas pudding!
- Did you want it?
Daddy was buying it for me.
He's getting paid today.
Here, Oliver.
Don't you want it?
Say that you got it from a rich lady.
- I'm not rich.
- But I am.
I'm loaded.
Now I'm taking you to a place where you've never been.
- Where is that?
- A restaurant.
But we can't go in these clothes.
We have to go home and change.
I have an idea.
Come on.
- Aren't we going that way?
- No.
We'll go another way.
- Nice table.
- Something to drink?
Please.
What do you want to drink?
- Milk.
- Yes, milk...
Sweet or sour?
Cold or hot?
- I'd rather have juice.
- Strawberry or raspberry?
- Apple juice or orange juice?
- Yes.
One raspberry juice, one strawberry juice, one orange juice, one apple juice, and a big glass of cold milk?
Thank you.
Why, I've never...!
Give me the police.
Quickly.
Enjoy.
Eat.
It's salmon!
Do I have to eat everything?
You're not full already?
Do you want to taste?
It's really good.
No.
Did you like it?
- What is it?
- Some russian stuff.
What is it?
I got a really bad tummy ache.
- Finish up.
We have to go.
- Aren't you going to pay?
Do we do that here?
Pssst!
- Let's go.
- What about all the food?
Come on.
Excuse me.
An important message from the office.
What?
A burglary at my place?
I beg your pardon, Miss Hose.
I'll be right back.
- Look, Sebastian.
A real car!
- It's only a Buick.
Can't we look at the car?
- You've never been to a restaurant.
- Not that one.
Hurry up.
- Are you really rich?
- We have to make the train!
Why were you afraid of that man?
Look!
- Mommy had one of those.
- Do you like the book?
- Kamilla.
Kamilla?
- What is that?
There you go.
It's for you.
- Thank you!
- Now, now...
Hurry up!
Hurry!
- When is the next train?
- Not until tonight.
- I'm sorry.
- What is it now?
I didn't mean to hold you back.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just that...
We stayed too long at the restaurant.
You'll get there.
Even if we have to walk the whole way.
Who's your new friend, Kamilla?
is it someone you can trust?
is it someone who can hold your hand?
when the road ahead seems hopelessly long night is coming soon, Kamilla the sky will get dark and full of stars and you need someone to hold your hand
you still have a long way to go
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend that you can trust?
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend that you can trust?
Do you want a potato?
You didn't see my little sister on the train?
Not as far as I know.
- Don't you want a ride?
- No thanks.
I have to get back.
Alright.
Do you know that a little spark can start a big fire?
My father blew up mountains and rocks with these little sparks.
But one day a big rock landed on him, and he became a cripple.
I had to take care of myself.
And my mom...
She died in prison right after.
She wanted to steal some bread for me and my sister.
Still the police locked her up in a nasty, cold, mouldy basement.
She was cold.
She became sick.
That's what I'm most afraid of in the whole world.
But we go to heaven.
- We do?
- Mommy and daddy are there.
They're probably eating with your mommy.
Afterwards they run around barefoot in soft grass.
And they sleep in hammocks with nice lions and bunnies.
- Lions don't bite in heaven.
- There are no cold prisons there.
No, because nobody has to steal.
I think the shop could have given your mother some bread.
I hope I don't end up in a dark, lonely hole like that.
- Did you steal something?
- Shush.
Shush.
Wait here.
What's a young lady doing all alone in the woods at this time of night?
And what's the young lady doing in my berry spot?
What a nice watch.
Real gold.
I see we have company?
No, don't get up.
There should be plenty of food for everyone.
Are you taking a walk in the woods?
I sell merchandise to the farms.
What kind of merchandise?
This and that.
Different things.
And I play for people.
- Good!
Could you play for us?
- Yes.
Kamilla, that sack is full of stolen silverware.
The sheriff is probably looking for him.
Kamilla...
Kamilla, that sack is full of stolen silverware.
We have to get away.
Nice.
As a thank you I'll give you this one.
Well played, but we've had enough of the forest.
- So we better get...
- No.
You don't fool Joakim Jensen.
You're going straight to the sheriff to report me.
- Why would we go to the sheriff?
- To claim the reward.
There is a big reward for whoever catches Joakim Jensen.
Just stay there.
We can eat now.
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
- What is it?
- The money!
He stole all the money last night.
My gold watch!
Maybe you ought to send a telegram to your uncle.
Do you think uncle Ole could have changed his mind?
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la
Kamilla Pytten is my name and I'm really very happy
I'm getting a home of my own when we get there
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Kamilla, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian is my name and even though my life is hard and the road is long and heavy I'll sing a little song
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sebastian, that's me tra-la-la-la-la-la we have no more money we're not rich anymore what's waiting behind the next turn nobody knows but we take comfort in our song listen to the nice sound we're walking and singing together as friends the two of us
two friends we are tra-la-la-la-la-la-la two friends we are tra-la-la-la-la-la
Sofie!
Sofie!
- Sofie!
- Kamilla.
Kamilla!
What happened?
- Where have you been?
- Sebastian followed me all the way.
- Sebastian?
- A rich man who helps children.
There was a thief in the woods.
He stole all his money.
And the nice medal that mommy gave me.
You're here at least.
Sebastian has to stay with us until he gets his money back.
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
Aunt Louise said that you couldn't afford to buy your own house.
If you made more money, Sebastian could stay with us.
- Are you going to prison?
- Why do you ask?
If you let Sebastian steal I won't tell anyone.
Silly girl.
Why should I steal?
- To buy this nice house?
- Do you think it's that nice?
Time to come out.
There.
Hurry up so you don't get cold.
There.
Are you going to prison?
Can you keep a secret?
- Uncle Ole gave me the money.
- Uncle Ole?
I feel sorry for him if aunt Louise finds out.
She'll run him up to the top of the flagpole.
You're kidding.
Aunt Louise doesn't have a flagpole.
But she'll serve him stewed rubble for dinner.
There.
I'm sure about that.
- Did you find your bed already?
- Is this my bed?
Come, I'll show you something.
There.
Look.
That's the picture that mommy gave you.
Did you find it?
Kamilla.
Kamilla.
Promise that you'll never leave with strangers again.
Promise.
The next time it could be someone who wants to trick you.
Do you understand?
- Rolly can't stay there.
- Rolly?
You're so dirty.
Go wash up.
Smells good.
Can I try?
If you're going to try there won't be much left for the wedding.
Are you starting at our school?
There's a mean boy in our class.
But don't worry about him.
Do you want to look at our sheep?
Get out.
Here, Kamilla.
There.
- What about the potatoes?
- I'll do them later.
- Come, Kamilla!
- Come on.
- There.
- Come on.
Do you want some?
It is nice to sit down and take a little rest.
- The children are busy down there.
- Nice.
We have rabbits as well.
Do you want to see them?
- What on earth...
- What a racket!
- Berta, hurry up!
- Christoffer!
- Christoffer, what is that thing?
- What is it?
- Stop!
You're scaring the animals!
- What is that?
- Isn't it one of those...?
- Christoffer!
- It could be dangerous.
Careful!
- Christoffer!
Christoffer!
Christoffer!
Do you think I want to run after you?
I do.
- What is that?
- What's he doing here?
- The horse!
- Stop the thief!
Help!
- Look at that man!
- Stop.
He's taking the horse!
Get the animals moving.
I think he stole a ham.
Come on.
- Look!
That's our horse.
- I'll kill him!
Look out!
There!
Come on.
Look!
Not bad.
It was probably the thief that we met in the woods.
Do you think that Sebastian is alone now?
He'll be ok.
Dear God.
You have to help the nice Sebastian Kåk.
Good night, Kamilla.
Her name is Kamilla Pytten.
She's starting with us.
She has come from town and is staying with her sister.
Maybe some of you already have gotten to know her?
Stand up, Peder.
I know where she lives.
Next to the haunted house.
You mean next to the Simen cottage.
We have to get started.
There's a seat next to Maren.
We'll stand and sing our morning song.
praise the Lord he is near when we're singing when we're praying we are gathered in his name he dwells in our midst...
Is it true that the Simen cottage is haunted?
People say that Simen, who used to own it, comes at night to look for his money.
Nobody wants to come here at night.
That's why nobody wanted this house.
Isn't it strange?
I've lived here for several months, and I still haven't seen a ghost.
We're busy at the farm now.
Otherwise you could have come with me.
I don't like you being alone.
There.
Can you carry all this?
- Yes.
- Can you?
Good.
Go straight home and lock the door.
You'll be safe.
- Good morning.
- But hurry up.
- I see you're keeping busy?
- A lot to do for the wedding.
That's where she lives.
I bet they have silverware there.
You don't touch that house.
I want that gold watch now.
Sit down.
Calm down.
I have a proposition.
You get the gold watch.
- I get the suit.
- The suit is worth more than that.
Alright.
But we share the money.
They're not yours.
- Did you forget?
- I was the one who nicked them.
Yes...
I nicked them as well.
From a rich man in the woods.
- We'll share.
- Fifty-fifty.
- Fifty-fifty.
- First the suit.
- Right?
- Right.
Then we're even.
The gold watch.
You have a lot to learn, kid.
See you later.
Sebastian!
- We'll jump with joy.
- Look what I brought you.
Why do you have the thief's clothes?
I had to swap clothes to get the watch.
- Is the thief still in the woods?
- Yes.
I saw him steal a ham at the farm.
Did you?
- What are you making?
- I just finished "Seven sisters".
"Seven sisters".
- Are you going to America?
- Me?
No, I still don't have enough money.
- You can stay with us.
- Sofie wouldn't like that.
Do you speak American?
Yes.
Seems pretty perilous.
- What does that mean?
- I need some new clothes.
Say some more.
Simsurium sari pam picnic.
That means that I need a razor.
- Are you saying that for real?
- I can't wear these rags.
No, you can't.
But we don't have any men's clothes.
Look at this.
Run to the store and get me some.
- Pants and a shirt as well?
- And a shaving kit.
But you can't say that it's for Sebastian.
- Why not?
- Nobody can know that I'm here.
It's a secret that only you and me share.
But what if they ask?
Say that you've gotten a visit from an uncle from America.
- Have I?
- At least a pretend uncle.
- Bye!
- Bye.
There's nothing in the paper these days.
There's something happening here, Sofie.
A criminal has escaped.
Did you hear that, Sofie?
A criminal has escaped from the town prison.
There's a picture of him.
Joakim Jensen.
And here's a picture of another one who is wanted.
- Sebastian Kåk.
- What did you say?
Look at this.
Joakim Jensen.
A dangerous criminal.
Just look at his eyes.
- Have you seen anything more spooky?
- It's him!
- Do you know him?
- I thought I had seen him.
What?
- It smells clean.
- Do you wash the clothes?
Sometimes.
It was too much money.
I got a ride with Big Peder and his granddad.
Everybody thinks that I have a guest from America.
Kamilla, I'm horribly tired.
Do you think I can borrow your bed?
- It's in there.
- But...
I have big problems falling asleep.
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
It's best if somebody sings to me while I fall asleep.
Can you do that?
- Say a prayer as well?
- Maybe some other time.
But don't open the door before I wake up.
I'll take a little nap.
- Hi.
- You have guests from America?
- What?
- That uncle of yours must be rich.
- Uncle?
What uncle?
- The American.
Kamilla got a ride from the store.
She told me all about it.
- Was he blonde?
- Don't know.
I didn't see him.
- You have to be quiet.
- Why?
- Guess.
- Is he here?
In there.
- Quiet.
Don't wake him up.
- Is he sleeping?
You scared me.
- I almost thought it was true.
- He was there.
- He even borrowed my bed.
- Nobody has been sleeping in it.
Look.
Here are his clothes.
You know what?
He had to swap with the thief to get the watch.
- Look.
- Kamilla.
- Sebastian is a thief.
- You're lying!
He's wanted by the police.
Listen to me!
Don't you understand?
He's dangerous.
You saw all his money.
- You're lying!
- He stole them from a factory.
- It's true.
- Sebastian has never stolen.
The police can't take Sebastian!
- Was he horrible?
- How did you chase him away?
- Did he steal anything?
- Mommy said he was big and scary.
- Did he have fangs?
- What did you tell him?
You must have said something.
Otherwise he would have hit you.
Thieves are cruel.
You're the bravest person at this school.
Kamilla is lying.
I bet she hid under the bed.
- Kamilla talked to the thief.
- She's lying.
If it was me I wouldn't have talked to him.
- I would just have kicked him out.
- You wouldn't dare.
I've talked to the king himself.
The king is nothing compared to a real thief.
I'm much more brave.
I'll throw a sandwich at the teacher.
Kamilla dares to eat with criminals.
But I dare to jump from the roof of the pigsty.
Kamilla dares to balance on the schoolhouse roof.
I sing the anthem outside the sheriff's window when he takes a nap.
Kamilla dares to sit alone in the Simen cottage at midnight.
She doesn't dare.
I bet 30 copper coins.
And I bet 35 coppers that she dares.
You dare, Kamilla.
Right?
I bet 5 coppers that she doesn't dare.
I bet 5 coppers that she doesn't dare.
- Me too.
- One krone that she dares.
She dares to!
I bet 3 coppers.
- I bet 10 coppers that she dares.
- I bet 30 coppers that she dares.
- I bet 3 coppers that she dares.
- I bet 7.
I bet she doesn't dare.
1 krone.
She's in for a big surprise.
Touch the ring if you like touch the ring touch your boyfriend if you like
- Aren't you going to eat?
- What time is it?
I don't know.
Almost 11 I think.
- Don't we have to go now?
- Yes.
Where are the others?
- It's 11 o'clock.
- I know.
Big Peder isn't here.
Only his mother and grandfather.
- Is he backing out?
- Coward.
Tell everyone that we're leaving.
No, you go.
It doesn't matter what you say.
You go first.
Are you going to open a restaurant?
She's sleepwalking.
Shush.
- Did she leave already?
- Shush.
I'm so small.
You're much bigger.
Can't you scare the ghosts?
- Ghosts!
- Shame on you for scaring us!
- It's something else!
- We've seen a ghost.
Stop that nonsense.
You're not allowed to cheat.
- She's in there.
- There's a real ghost in there.
Be quiet.
It's me.
Kamilla.
What are you doing?
- A bet.
- Are there more people coming?
- No.
- Did you make some kind of trap?
- Something else?
- No.
- You swear?
- We swear.
The thief!
Does he live here?
Promise not to come here again.
It's dangerous.
- I have to stay until midnight.
- What?
- Why?
- The bet.
If Joakim comes you have to be quiet.
Is it true that you're a thief?
You're the one who's been stealing from the farm.
- Yes.
- We could have given you food.
It's not that simple.
Be quiet.
Not one word.
Turn off the lamp.
There's a whole bunch of kids outside.
- You can't go out there.
- We have to keep watch.
Go to the window.
Who are you hiding in there?
- You can't go in there.
- Who is it?
Answer me.
- No!
Kamilla is in there.
- Kamilla?
And who opened the door for Kamilla?
Answer me.
- She got in on her own.
- Idiot!
Are you trying to get us arrested?
I know what to do.
Get going.
- Come.
You have to get out of here.
- You're bleeding.
It's nothing.
Is it bad if you loose that bet?
I'll tell you a story.
Have you heard about Groggen?
Why did you become a thief?
Not all thieves want to become thieves.
Not Joakim either.
But why do you steal?
Have you heard about Groggen?
He lived by the mines where my father worked.
Do you know where he lived?
On a hill of sand.
- What hill?
- One of those by the mines.
- On the floor?
- Yes.
He lived at the bottom.
One day he decided to go to America.
It's past midnight.
We have to rescue her.
He saw two tiny spots.
America.
But before they got there he looked into the water.
Are you all scaredy cats?
Big Peder is afraid of ghosts.
I'll go in alone.
- Mommy!
- But it's...
Kamilla!
She's dead.
Help, he's coming!
- Help!
- Help!
Kamilla?
Isn't she dead?
- Is she alive again?
- What was that?
- Was he horrible?
- Yes.
I'm hungry.
- Was he huge?
- Black and horrible.
Like that cat at the Salbakken.
And he had red eyes.
- Weren't you afraid?
- At first I was afraid.
And then I became more afraid.
And then I fell asleep.
Tell us more, Kamilla.
That's all.
Where on earth have you been?
- With Kamilla.
- At this time?
Kamilla!
Kamilla!
Kamilla, hi!
Kamilla!
Can you help me?
Hide this for a little while.
- You've been stealing at the farm.
- No, I haven't.
Quickly.
- Hi.
- He isn't here.
Don't be afraid.
Stand by the door.
He got away again.
Come on.
We're going to the woods.
Good morning.
I'm cleaning up my mess.
I've decided to move.
- To America?
- No.
Not exactly that far.
You don't have to move.
Look at this.
Thanks for forgetting this one.
Last night...
I...
I became a completely different Sebastian Kåk.
A different Sebastian Kåk?
I don't want to steal anymore.
Nice breeze today.
Do you want to make a kite?
- Are you going to stop stealing?
- Yes.
And if you have something good in your basket -
- I'll make you a kite with a tail and a veil.
Finish your bread.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
It's just luck that we have ham.
There's been so many thefts.
- indeed?
- Burglaries...
- Again?
- While we celebrated the wedding all the silverware disappeared from Elvebakken.
They must have a hideout around here.
- Didn't the cook talk about ghosts?
- She's always talking about ghosts.
- She's right behind you.
- The Simen cottage is haunted.
Everybody says so.
Could you please pass the cheese?
There are ghosts there for real.
I've seen...
What have you seen?
Excuse us, but we need help.
We just saw the thieves outside the old smithy.
- We can get them now.
- Let's get them.
- I need more people.
- We're coming.
Now?
In the middle of the wedding breakfast?
Calm down, mother.
Can you hold this?
Can you hold it?
When I count to three, you let go.
One, two, three!
- We found him!
- Let's get him!
Come on!
I have to get my shotgun.
Here!
Come on!
They're leaving!
Kamilla, do you want to try?
Look!
Sebastian, look!
Come.
Kamilla, I think we'll try.
Run, Sebastian!
Let's try the kite.
- Run, Sebastian!
- Kamilla.
If the sheriff doesn't get me now, I'll stay a thief forever.
You'll die.
Kamilla.
I'll get out again.
Then I'll be free.
- Will you come here?
- If you and Sofie let me.
Let me go, so the sheriff can get me.
Look.
It's yours.
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
- Let the sheriff get him.
- It's the thief.
Sebastian Kåk?
- Take it easy.
- Sebastian.
Sebastian!
Kamilla!
Sebastian Kåk, you're under arrest.
Kamilla!
- Get it up!
- Higher!
- Higher.
- Look, Kamilla.
There's a message for you on the kite.
Can you see what it says?
Cry no more for me, Kamilla
I'll be back soon my life as a thief is over
I have to take the punishment I deserve and when I come back I'll be free we'll be waiting, Sebastian someday you'll be free it'll be a day with new possibilities
Kamilla, Kamilla I'll come back to you and I think that you'll receive me as a friend
who's your new friend, Kamilla?
is it someone you can trust?
is it someone who can hold your hand when the road seems long and hard soon night will fall, Kamilla the sky will be dark and full of stars and you need someone to hold our hand you still have a long way to go
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend you can trust?
Kamilla, Kamilla what are you thinking now?
do you dare to think that he's a friend who you can trust?
- The Chief Whip and Party Chairman to see you.
- Take a seat.
I'll be right with you.
Bernard, take a seat.
I want you here for this meeting.
- Isn't this a party matter?
- It's also a government matter.
- It's about our education policy.
- The government's or party's?
- It's the same thing.
- With respect, they're not the same thing.
- That's why we want the meeting.
- It seems...
Bernard... sit!
Stay.
What's the problem?
- Education.
- What can I do about it?
- You're the Prime Minister.
- Yes, I know.
I have no direct control over education.
I don't control the curriculum or exams.
I don't control the choice of head teachers.
Nothing.
The voters hold you responsible for everything.
You do have influence.
I'm fed up with it.
When I became PM, I thought I'd have power.
And what have I got?
Influence.
I've got no power over the police, the rates,
EEC directives, European courts, our courts, the judges, NATO.
- What have I got the power to do?
- Lose us the next election.
Which you will if you don't tackle education.
The voters want something done about low academic attainment.
- Sex education!
- I'm not against sex education.
I'm not against children being taught the facts of life in class, but not homosexual technique!
- Or heterosexual technique, come to that.
- Where should they learn it?
Behind the bike sheds like we did!
Did you?
Never mind sexual technique.
Some of our schools are teaching more Hindi than English.
I know English is more important, but I daren't say so or I'd be accused of racism.
When I met the Ethnic Awareness Council, I happened to glance at my watch when a black woman delegate was speaking and I was accused of racist body language.
And sexist.
- I get the message.
What do you want me to do?
- Get a grip on education.
Get Henry to do something about the Department of Education.
- They've got him house-trained.
- Sack him.
I can't have another Cabinet convulsion.
- Then invite the opposition leader's wife here.
- What can she do?
Start measuring up for carpets and curtains.
Yes, right, fine.
This afternoon?
- Bernard, I believe the PM wants to see me.
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.
- What's his problem?
- Education.
Well, it's a bit late to do anything about that now.
- No, no, the education system.
- I see.
- Bit late to do anything about that either.
- He thinks he'll lose the next election.
- Worse things could befall the nation.
- He can't ignore facts.
If he can't ignore facts, he's got no business being a politician.
Anyway, Bernard, he's got nothing to worry about.
The education system does all most parents require of it.
Keeps children out of mischief while they're at work.
That paper the Party Chairman had suggests the comprehensive system is breaking down.
Bernard, I never thought to hear such language from a loyal member of the Civil Service!
- Have you been got at by the enemy?
- You mean the Russians?
No, Bernard, I mean the Prime Minister's political advisor - that Wainwright female.
- Comprehensive education ought to be validated.
- Of course, but not invalidated.
But if it was introduced to improve standards...
Whatever gave you that idea?
- You mean it was to get rid of class distinction?
- Precisely!
- So that all children...
- Children?
- Who mentioned children?
- I just...
The Department of Education never mentions children!
No, no, no, no, Bernard.
It was to get rid of class distinction in the teaching profession.
Improve the living standard of teachers, not the educational standards of children.
Bring the NUT teachers up to the salary level of their rivals in the National Association of Schoolmasters in the grammar schools.
- But the...
- When there is a Labour government, the Education Department says comprehensives abolish the class system.
When there's a Tory government, they say it's the cheapest way to provide mass education.
To Labour, we explain that selective education is divisive and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive.
That way, we have a happy relationship with the NUT and we educate our own children privately.
- But if the government wants change...
- The teaching unions don't.
Isn't it our job to persuade unions to accept government policy?
No, it is our job to get the government to accept union policy.
Since government change policy all the time and unions never change their policy at all, common sense requires that the government be brought in line with the unions.
Yes, Prime Minister?
Oh, fine.
He can see you now.
Sir Humphrey, he's very worried that he seems responsible for something he can't change.
Yes, I'm sure.
Responsibility without power - the prerogative of the eunuch throughout the ages.
- Prime Minister.
- Good morning.
What were you saying?
Nothing.
I understand you're worried about the local education authority.
- No, the Department of Education and Science.
- Indeed?
I think the DES does a splendid job.
Look what's happened to education.
This is a question from a Religious Studies paper.
"Which do you prefer - atom bombs or charity?"
Even maths is politicised.
"If it costs £5 billion a year to maintain Britain's nuclear defences
"and £75 a year to feed a starving African child,
"how many children could be saved from starvation
"if the Ministry of Defence abandoned nuclear weapons?"
That's easy.
None.
They'd spend it all on conventional weapons.
In any case, it's just a sum.
Five billion divided by 75.
But children aren't learning to do the sums.
The local education authorities might argue that they don't need to.
They have calculators.
They all need to know HOW it's done.
We were all taught basis arithmetic, weren't we?
Were we?
What's 3,947 divided by 73?
Er...
Oh, I'd need a pencil and paper to do that.
No, never mind that.
- I could do it when I left school.
- Now you'd use a calculator.
That's not the point.
Look at Latin.
Hardly anybody knows that now.
Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.
What?
- Times change and we change with the times.
- Precisely.
- Si tacuisses, philosophus manisses.
- What does that mean?
If you'd kept your mouth shut, we might have thought you were clever.
- I beg your pardon?
- Not you, Prime Minister.
That's the translation.
No one would have thought Sir Humphrey was saying that about you.
Go away, Bernard, please.
I can't believe it.
You had a strict academic upbringing.
Are you denying the value of it?
What's the use of it?
I can't even call upon it in conversation with the PM of Great Britain!
Education in this country is a disaster.
We're supposed to prepare children for work.
Most of the time they're bored stiff.
I should've thought that being bored stiff was an excellent preparation for work.
The school leaving age was raised to 16, but they're learning less.
We didn't raise it so they'd learn more but to keep teenagers off the job market and hold down unemployment figures.
Are you saying there's nothing wrong with education?
Of course not.
It's a joke.
It's always been a joke.
By leaving it in the hands of local councillors, it will remain a joke.
Half of them are your enemies and the other half are the sort of friends that make you prefer your enemies.
- What are you saying?
- That education will never get any better as long as it's subject to all that tomfoolery in the town halls.
Imagine what would happen if you put defence in their hands.
- Defence?
- Give councils £100 million each and ask them to defend themselves, we'd have a civil war in three weeks!
- You're being silly.
- Am I?
That's what's happened to education.
And why?
Because nobody thinks education is serious the way defence is serious.
So that's why civil defence is in local authority hands?
Of course.
Because everybody knows it's a joke.
You just don't leave important matters in the hands of those clowns!
And as you've left education to them, one must assume that, until now, you have attached little importance to it.
It is important.
It could lose me the next election.
Ah!
In my naivety, I thought you were concerned about the future of our children.
Yes, that too.
After all, they get the vote at 18.
Then, Prime Minister, then centralise.
Take it away from the local councils.
Put it under the Department of Education, then you could do something about it.
Do you think I could?
Grasp the nettle, take the bull by the horns?
You can't take the bull by the horns if you're grasping the nettle.
Oh, really, Bernard?
By grasping the nettle with one hand, you could take the bull by one horn with the other hand, but not both horns because your hand isn't big enough.
If you did take the bull by one horn, it would be rather dangerous because...
Well, it was just a mixed metaphor and since we were discussing education, I...
- (BUZZER)
- Thank God!
Yes?
Your political advisor's outside.
- Send her in, Bernard.
Humphrey, thank you.
- Thank you.
- You've given me much food for thought.
- In that case, Prime Minister, bon appétit.
Dear lady.
- Yes, Dorothy?
- My notes for your tour of the north-west.
Visits to hospitals and factories.
- Drumming up votes in marginal constituencies.
- No!
- Why not?
- I'm coming with you if it's a government tour.
If it's canvassing marginals, I can't come and the Treasury can't pay.
It's a government visit.
It's coincidence that all the stop-offs are in marginals.
- Well, that's all right, then.
- That's OK.
What can I do about education?
Quickly.
- You mean do or appear to do?
- Appear to do.
I can't do, obviously.
Well, in the short term, we could get you on TV associated with something good and successful.
- Is there something?
- I had thought of this for your schedule.
- You could fit it in.
- St Margaret's School Young Enterprise Scheme.
It's set up its own manufacturing company.
They make cheeseboards, paperweights, toast racks, sell them and track the operation in their business-study classes.
- They involve local businessmen.
Parents help.
- Does it cost a lot?
- No, it makes a profit.
- Isn't it teaching them to be rather grasping?
- No, they give the money to local charity.
- Fine, I'll do it.
Make sure the TV crews have plenty of time to cover me... er... cover the event properly.
Write me a speech with a snappy, 20-second piece for the news bulletins.
- That should win back a few seats.
- Prime Minister.
Er, give a lead to those responsible for the nation's education, Bernard.
Of course, Prime Minister.
(NEWSREADER) Finally, the PM visited St Margaret's School on his north-western tour.
The school has set up a manufacturing business where the children make a variety of goods for sale in the local community.
The children do their own sales and marketing and use the experience they gain as a basis for their maths and business studies.
The Prime Minister was presented with an example of the school's output.
In conclusion, I must congratulate you on all the hard work, the discipline and the success of your enterprise.
You've set an example in British education which other schools would do well to follow.
We need more schools like St Margaret's and I shall always treasure your present.
No Prime Minister ever lost a seat if he could help itl
(NEWSREADER) And that was the six o'clock news from the BBC.
- I thought that was OK, didn't you?
- Fine.
- My joke went down well.
- MY joke!
Better than Channel 4 coverage.
They didn't describe it as the PM's tour of the north-west.
They said, "Jim Hacker touring the marginal constituencies."
- That's true, isn't it?
- But they shouldn't say it.
It's biased reporting!
- Reporting the facts?
- Nothing wrong with visiting the marginals.
- What they said was still true.
- It was still biased to say it!
I'm not interested in your paranoia.
I was interested in that school.
- Parents queue up to get their children into it.
- Pity they can't all get in.
Coffee?
- Lovely.
- Why can't more parents send children there?
- No room.
- There is.
School numbers are falling.
- That'd mean poaching the other schools.
- So what?
The other schools would have to close.
Great!
St Margaret's could take over their buildings.
- Darling, that wouldn't be fair.
- Who to?
- The teachers in the schools that had to close.
- Good ones could teach at the popular schools.
What about the bad teachers?
It wouldn't be fair on them.
What about the children, or are the bad teachers' jobs more important?
Darling, it's... it's no good.
Who's to say who are the bad teachers?
It just wouldn't work.
- Why not?
- Well... it wouldn't work.
- Why not?
- What do you mean?
Suppose schools were like doctors.
In the NHS, you choose which doctor to go to, don't you?
- Yes.
- And he gets paid per patient.
Why don't we do the same with schools?
Have a National Education Service.
Parents could choose the schools and the schools get paid per pupil.
- Exactly!
- There'd be an outcry.
- From the parents?
- No, from the Department of Education.
- I see.
And who has the most votes?
- The DES would block it.
- Fine, get rid of them.
- What?
- Get rid of the Department of Education.
- I don't understand you.
Get rid of it, abolish it, remove it, expunge it, eliminate it, eradicate it, exterminate it!
- Get rid of it!
- Get rid of it?
- Yes.
- I couldn't do that.
- Why not?
What does it do?
- I could do that.
Local government could administer the lot.
We could have a Board of School Inspectors.
The rest could go to Environment.
I could send that house-trained idiot Henry to the House of Lords.
Golly.
I wonder what Humphrey will say.
Whatever he says, I want to be there when you tell him.
To witness the clash between the political will and the administrative will?
I think it'll be a clash between the political will and the administrative won't.
- You sent for me, Prime Minister?
- Humphrey, come in.
Sit down.
I want to bounce an idea off you.
I've realised how to reform the educational system.
Excellent, Prime Minister. (CLAPS HIS HANDS)
I'm going to let parents move their children to any school they want.
You mean after application, scrutiny, tribunal hearing and appeals procedures?
- No, just move them whenever they want to.
- I'm sorry.
I don't quite follow.
This government will let parents decide which schools to send their children to.
Prime Minister, you can't be serious!
- I am.
- But it's preposterous!
- Why?
- You can't expect parents to make these choices.
How on earth would parents know which schools are best?
- Which school did you go to, Humphrey?
- Winchester.
- Was it good?
- Oh, excellent, of course.
- Who chose it?
- My parents, naturally.
Now, that's different, Prime Minister.
My parents were discerning people.
You can't expect ordinary people to know where to send their children.
- Why not?
- Well, how could they tell?
They could tell if their kids could read, write and do sums and if the exam results were good.
- Exam results aren't everything.
- True.
Parents who don't want an academic education for their children can pick progressive schools.
But parents have no qualifications to make these choices.
Teachers are the professionals.
Parents are the worst people to bring up children.
They've no qualifications, no training.
You don't expect untrained teachers to teach.
The same should apply to parents.
- Before having children, they should be trained?
- No, that's no problem.
They've all been trained to HAVE kids.
Sex-education classes have been standard for some years.
Perhaps we could do better.
Before people can have children, we should make them sit exams - written and practical.
Perhaps both.
Then they could be issued with breeding licences.
Oh, very droll, Prime Minister.
No, but I'm being serious.
It's looking after children that parents are not qualified for.
That's why they have no idea which schools to choose.
It couldn't work.
What about the Health Service?
People choose their doctor without medical qualifications.
- Ah, yes, well, that's different.
- How?
Well, doctors are...
The patients aren't parents, dear lady.
Oh, really?
What makes you think that, Humpy?
Not as such.
In any case, as a matter of fact,
I think letting people choose doctors is a very bad idea, very messy.
Much tidier to allocate people to GPs, much fairer.
Then everyone has an equal chance of getting the bad doctors.
- I see.
- In any case, we're talking about education.
With respect, Prime Minister,
I think that the DES will react with some caution to your rather novel proposals.
- You mean they'll block it.
- They will give it urgent consideration and insist on a thorough and rigorous examination of all the proposals allied to a detailed feasibility study and budget analysis before producing a consultative document for consideration by all interested bodies and seeking comments and recommendations to be included in a brief
for a series of working parties who will produce individual studies which will provide the background for a more wide-ranging document considering whether or not the proposal should be taken forward to the next stage.
- You mean they'll block it.
- Yeah.
- No problem.
- We thought you'd say that.
- We have a solution.
- Oh, yes?
We'll abolish the DES.
- I'm sorry?
- We'll abolish it.
- Abolish it?
- Why not?
Abolish Education and Science?
!
- That'd be the end of civilisation as we know it!
- Only the department.
Education will flourish.
- With no government department?
Impossible!
- Departments are tombstones.
The Department of Industry marks the grave of industry, the Department of Employment, that of employment, the Department of Environment, that of the environment.
And the Department of Education marks where the corpse of British education is buried.
What does the DES do?
What's its role?
I hardly know where to begin!
It lays down guidelines, it centralises and channels money into education authorities, University Grants Committee, it sets standards!
- Does it set the curriculum?
- It would like to!
- Select and change head teachers?
- Maintain school buildings?
- No...
- Set exams?
- No...
- Does it choose the children?
- How does it affect what a child does at school?
- It supplies 60% of the cash.
Why can't the cash go from the Treasury to the schools?
Do we need 2,000 civil servants to funnel money from A to B?
The DES also creates a legislative framework for education.
Not much legislation.
Environment could do that.
They deal with other local authority matters.
You can't be serious!
Who'd assess forward planning and staffing variations, variations in pupil populations, density of schooling required in urban and rural areas?
- Who'd make sure everything ran properly?
- 2,500 private schools seem to solve these problems every day without any help from the DES.
They respond to changing circumstances.
- Supply and demand.
It's easy.
- Who would plan for the future?
Education today is what the department planned?
Well, of...
No, of course not!
- Is there anything else that the DES does?
- Well, it... it...
Well, we don't need it, then, do we?
QED.
Quod erat demonstrandum.
I really...
Quite unthinkable.
Once they start abolishing whole departments, the very foundations of civilisation crumble.
- Barbarians at the gates.
- The return of the Dark Ages.
Did anything like this crop up when you were Cabinet Secretary?
No.
We let them amalgamate departments, but that worked very well.
Yes, quite.
You keep the existing staff and you put in an extra layer of coordinating management at the top.
Exactly.
But you have to stop the liquidation of the Department of Education, Humphrey.
Have you tried discrediting the person who proposed it?
No point.
It was the Wainwright female, so he's passing it off as his own idea.
- Discrediting the facts behind it?
- It's a political idea, so facts don't come into it.
- Massaging the figures?
- No figures are involved.
But it's hard to get the Prime Minister to see that it's a bad idea.
Of course.
It's actually a very good idea.
It just mustn't happen.
I wonder if we oughtn't to play along with it - in the interests of the nation's children.
Never mind the nation's children.
What about our colleagues at the DES?
- Of course.
Sorry.
- Let's be clear about this.
The only people who'll like this idea are the parents and the children.
Everyone who counts will be against it.
- Teachers' unions.
- Local authorities.
- Educational press.
- And, of course, the DES.
- So what's the strategy?
- Unions can be counted on to disrupt the schools.
And go on TV saying the government are causing the disruption.
Good.
Local councils will threaten to turn the constituency parties against the government.
The Department of Education will delay every stage of the process and leak anything that embarrasses the government.
We can help with that at the Campaign for Freedom of Information.
Thank you, Arnold.
Ah, thanks.
But what are we actually...
Thank you, Billy.
What's our argument?
Well, obviously, that this new proposal will destroy our educational system.
- Everybody knows it's destroyed already.
- Well, we will say...
Sorry, the press will say that it's government interference in the DES that destroyed it and that this new plan will make things worse.
- Will that do the trick?
- It always has in the past.
- But this time the political pressure is stronger.
- You must find a political weapon to fight it with.
What political weapon did you have in mind, Arnold?
I?
That is your concern, Humphrey.
Your chance to prove yourself worthy of the high office to which you've been called.
- The PM's ready to see you.
- What's it about?
- The abolition of the DES, I'm afraid.
- This is going to be bloody.
- There's a minor matter I need your advice...
- Is it important?
- Not important but urgent.
- What is it?
You know that enterprise school the PM visited, when they gave him that stool?
It's just come to light that the wood they were using was stolen.
Bernard, this is hardly...
Stolen?
Yes, it was government property stolen from a YTS workshop last year.
How shocking.
It was referred to the DES, as the theft came to light at a school.
They don't know whether to prosecute.
Sorry to bother...
Don't mention it, Bernard.
Show me in.
Come in, Humphrey.
Come in, come in!
Sit down.
Only one item on the agenda today - the abolition of the DES.
Actually, if there's only one item, it's an agendum.
I don't think the Prime Minister's got as far as the second declension.
I don't mind your scoring cheap debating points since you've already lost the battle of the DES.
- The DES will be very upset.
- Does it matter since they'll cease to exist?
The process will take a few years.
They'll fight tooth and nail.
- What can they do to me?
- They're a formidable department.
- I am a formidable Prime Minister.
- Indeed you are.
But you might still need their cooperation.
Cooperation?
From the Department of Education?
Don't make me laugh!
Fine, fine.
I'll tell them to go ahead with the prosecution, then.
- What prosecution?
- Oh, it's hardly worth bothering you with.
That enterprise school where you were televised last week.
- Yes?
- The profits...
A model for other schools...
Yes, yes, go on.
- The profits were the proceeds of theft.
- Theft?
What do you mean, theft?
I mean removing goods without the knowledge or consent of the owner with the intent of...
I know what theft means.
What do YOU mean?
Well, the stool that they gave you was made from wood appropriated from the local YTS workshops.
- What do you mean?
- It was nicked.
By two of last year's pupils.
- A pair of nickers.
- Thank you, Bernard.
The YTS want to prosecute.
Now, the Department of Education could stop them.
You know, return the wood and hush it up.
Millions saw me on TV saying that school was an example!
Well, it is a sort of example.
They mustn't prosecute!
I hope the Department of Education won't leak the fact that you're covering up for crooks.
- You must tell them not to prosecute.
- That would need their cooperation.
I can just see the newspapers - "Jim's enterprising crooks.
"The Prime Minister has sat on the fence for so long that now he's become one."
Persuade them not to prosecute.
It's very difficult to persuade people to cooperate if they are actually under a death sentence.
- Death sentence?
- If you're abolishing the department.
Oh!
Oh, that!
No, that was just... a vague idea of Dorothy's.
An idle thought.
Nothing serious.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
Splendid, Prime Minister.
Shall we now continue with the agendum?
Agendum?
Oh, yes!
We have no agendum.
(RHYTHMICALLY) We have no agendum today!
Business concluded.
All right, Humphrey?
Yes, Prime Minister.
- The Chief Whip and Party Chairman to see you.
- Take a seat.
I'll be right with you.
Bernard, take a seat.
I want you here for this meeting.
- Isn't this a party matter?
- It's also a government matter.
- It's about our education policy.
- The government's or party's?
- It's the same thing.
- With respect, they're not the same thing.
- That's why we want the meeting.
- It seems...
Bernard... sit!
Stay.
What's the problem?
- Education.
- What can I do about it?
- You're the Prime Minister.
- Yes, I know.
I have no direct control over education.
I don't control the curriculum or exams.
I don't control the choice of head teachers.
Nothing.
The voters hold you responsible for everything.
You do have influence.
I'm fed up with it.
When I became PM, I thought I'd have power.
And what have I got?
Influence.
I've got no power over the police, the rates,
EEC directives, European courts, our courts, the judges, NATO.
- What have I got the power to do?
- Lose us the next election.
Which you will if you don't tackle education.
The voters want something done about low academic attainment.
- Sex education!
- I'm not against sex education.
I'm not against children being taught the facts of life in class, but not homosexual technique!
- Or heterosexual technique, come to that.
- Where should they learn it?
Behind the bike sheds like we did!
Did you?
Never mind sexual technique.
Some of our schools are teaching more Hindi than English.
I know English is more important, but I daren't say so or I'd be accused of racism.
When I met the Ethnic Awareness Council, I happened to glance at my watch when a black woman delegate was speaking and I was accused of racist body language.
And sexist.
- I get the message.
What do you want me to do?
- Get a grip on education.
Get Henry to do something about the Department of Education.
- They've got him house-trained.
- Sack him.
I can't have another Cabinet convulsion.
- Then invite the opposition leader's wife here.
- What can she do?
Start measuring up for carpets and curtains.
Yes, right, fine.
This afternoon?
- Bernard, I believe the PM wants to see me.
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.
- What's his problem?
- Education.
Well, it's a bit late to do anything about that now.
- No, no, the education system.
- I see.
- Bit late to do anything about that either.
- He thinks he'll lose the next election.
- Worse things could befall the nation.
- He can't ignore facts.
If he can't ignore facts, he's got no business being a politician.
Anyway, Bernard, he's got nothing to worry about.
The education system does all most parents require of it.
Keeps children out of mischief while they're at work.
That paper the Party Chairman had suggests the comprehensive system is breaking down.
Bernard, I never thought to hear such language from a loyal member of the Civil Service!
- Have you been got at by the enemy?
- You mean the Russians?
No, Bernard, I mean the Prime Minister's political advisor - that Wainwright female.
- Comprehensive education ought to be validated.
- Of course, but not invalidated.
But if it was introduced to improve standards...
Whatever gave you that idea?
- You mean it was to get rid of class distinction?
- Precisely!
- So that all children...
- Children?
- Who mentioned children?
- I just...
The Department of Education never mentions children!
No, no, no, no, Bernard.
It was to get rid of class distinction in the teaching profession.
Improve the living standard of teachers, not the educational standards of children.
Bring the NUT teachers up to the salary level of their rivals in the National Association of Schoolmasters in the grammar schools.
- But the...
- When there is a Labour government, the Education Department says comprehensives abolish the class system.
When there's a Tory government, they say it's the cheapest way to provide mass education.
To Labour, we explain that selective education is divisive and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive.
That way, we have a happy relationship with the NUT and we educate our own children privately.
- But if the government wants change...
- The teaching unions don't.
Isn't it our job to persuade unions to accept government policy?
No, it is our job to get the government to accept union policy.
Since government change policy all the time and unions never change their policy at all, common sense requires that the government be brought in line with the unions.
Yes, Prime Minister?
Oh, fine.
He can see you now.
Sir Humphrey, he's very worried that he seems responsible for something he can't change.
Yes, I'm sure.
Responsibility without power - the prerogative of the eunuch throughout the ages.
- Prime Minister.
- Good morning.
What were you saying?
Nothing.
I understand you're worried about the local education authority.
- No, the Department of Education and Science.
- Indeed?
I think the DES does a splendid job.
Look what's happened to education.
This is a question from a Religious Studies paper.
"Which do you prefer - atom bombs or charity?"
Even maths is politicised.
"If it costs?
billion a year to maintain Britain's nuclear defences
"and?
5 a year to feed a starving African child,
"how many children could be saved from starvation
"if the Ministry of Defence abandoned nuclear weapons?"
That's easy.
None.
They'd spend it all on conventional weapons.
In any case, it's just a sum.
Five billion divided by 75.
But children aren't learning to do the sums.
The local education authorities might argue that they don't need to.
They have calculators.
They all need to know HOW it's done.
We were all taught basis arithmetic, weren't we?
Were we?
What's 3,947 divided by 73?
Er...
Oh, I'd need a pencil and paper to do that.
No, never mind that.
- I could do it when I left school.
- Now you'd use a calculator.
That's not the point.
Look at Latin.
Hardly anybody knows that now.
Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.
What?
- Times change and we change with the times.
- Precisely.
- Si tacuisses, philosophus manisses.
- What does that mean?
If you'd kept your mouth shut, we might have thought you were clever.
- I beg your pardon?
- Not you, Prime Minister.
That's the translation.
No one would have thought Sir Humphrey was saying that about you.
Go away, Bernard, please.
I can't believe it.
You had a strict academic upbringing.
Are you denying the value of it?
What's the use of it?
I can't even call upon it in conversation with the PM of Great Britain!
Education in this country is a disaster.
We're supposed to prepare children for work.
Most of the time they're bored stiff.
I should've thought that being bored stiff was an excellent preparation for work.
The school leaving age was raised to 16, but they're learning less.
We didn't raise it so they'd learn more but to keep teenagers off the job market and hold down unemployment figures.
Are you saying there's nothing wrong with education?
Of course not.
It's a joke.
It's always been a joke.
By leaving it in the hands of local councillors, it will remain a joke.
Half of them are your enemies and the other half are the sort of friends that make you prefer your enemies.
- What are you saying?
- That education will never get any better as long as it's subject to all that tomfoolery in the town halls.
Imagine what would happen if you put defence in their hands.
- Defence?
- Give councils?
00 million each and ask them to defend themselves, we'd have a civil war in three weeks!
- You're being silly.
- Am I?
That's what's happened to education.
And why?
Because nobody thinks education is serious the way defence is serious.
So that's why civil defence is in local authority hands?
Of course.
Because everybody knows it's a joke.
You just don't leave important matters in the hands of those clowns!
And as you've left education to them, one must assume that, until now, you have attached little importance to it.
It is important.
It could lose me the next election.
Ah!
In my naivety, I thought you were concerned about the future of our children.
Yes, that too.
After all, they get the vote at 18.
Then, Prime Minister, then centralise.
Take it away from the local councils.
Put it under the Department of Education, then you could do something about it.
Do you think I could?
Grasp the nettle, take the bull by the horns?
You can't take the bull by the horns if you're grasping the nettle.
Oh, really, Bernard?
By grasping the nettle with one hand, you could take the bull by one horn with the other hand, but not both horns because your hand isn't big enough.
If you did take the bull by one horn, it would be rather dangerous because...
Well, it was just a mixed metaphor and since we were discussing education, I...
Thank God!
Yes?
Your political advisor's outside.
- Send her in, Bernard.
Humphrey, thank you.
- Thank you.
- You've given me much food for thought.
- In that case, Prime Minister, bon app閠it.
Dear lady.
- Yes, Dorothy?
- My notes for your tour of the north-west.
Visits to hospitals and factories.
- Drumming up votes in marginal constituencies.
- No!
- Why not?
- I'm coming with you if it's a government tour.
If it's canvassing marginals, I can't come and the Treasury can't pay.
It's a government visit.
It's coincidence that all the stop-offs are in marginals.
- Well, that's all right, then.
- That's OK.
What can I do about education?
Quickly.
- You mean do or appear to do?
- Appear to do.
I can't do, obviously.
Well, in the short term, we could get you on TV associated with something good and successful.
- Is there something?
- I had thought of this for your schedule.
- You could fit it in.
- St Margaret's School Young Enterprise Scheme.
It's set up its own manufacturing company.
They make cheeseboards, paperweights, toast racks, sell them and track the operation in their business-study classes.
- They involve local businessmen.
Parents help.
- Does it cost a lot?
- No, it makes a profit.
- Isn't it teaching them to be rather grasping?
- No, they give the money to local charity.
- Fine, I'll do it.
Make sure the TV crews have plenty of time to cover me... er... cover the event properly.
Write me a speech with a snappy, 20-second piece for the news bulletins.
- That should win back a few seats.
- Prime Minister.
Er, give a lead to those responsible for the nation's education, Bernard.
Of course, Prime Minister.
Finally, the PM visited St Margaret's School on his north-western tour.
The school has set up a manufacturing business where the children make a variety of goods for sale in the local community.
The children do their own sales and marketing and use the experience they gain as a basis for their maths and business studies.
The Prime Minister was presented with an example of the school's output.
In conclusion, I must congratulate you on all the hard work, the discipline and the success of your enterprise.
You've set an example in British education which other schools would do well to follow.
We need more schools like St Margaret's and I shall always treasure your present.
No Prime Minister ever lost a seat if he could help itl
And that was the six o'clock news from the BBC.
- I thought that was OK, didn't you?
- Fine.
- My joke went down well.
- MY joke!
Better than Channel 4 coverage.
They didn't describe it as the PM's tour of the north-west.
They said, "Jim Hacker touring the marginal constituencies. "
- That's true, isn't it?
- But they shouldn't say it.
It's biased reporting!
- Reporting the facts?
- Nothing wrong with visiting the marginals.
- What they said was still true.
- It was still biased to say it!
I'm not interested in your paranoia.
I was interested in that school.
- Parents queue up to get their children into it.
- Pity they can't all get in.
Coffee?
- Lovely.
- Why can't more parents send children there?
- No room.
- There is.
School numbers are falling.
- That'd mean poaching the other schools.
- So what?
The other schools would have to close.
Great!
St Margaret's could take over their buildings.
- Darling, that wouldn't be fair.
- Who to?
- The teachers in the schools that had to close.
- Good ones could teach at the popular schools.
What about the bad teachers?
It wouldn't be fair on them.
What about the children, or are the bad teachers' jobs more important?
Darling, it's... it's no good.
Who's to say who are the bad teachers?
It just wouldn't work.
- Why not?
- Well... it wouldn't work.
- Why not?
- What do you mean?
Suppose schools were like doctors.
In the NHS, you choose which doctor to go to, don't you?
- Yes.
- And he gets paid per patient.
Why don't we do the same with schools?
Have a National Education Service.
Parents could choose the schools and the schools get paid per pupil.
- Exactly!
- There'd be an outcry.
- From the parents?
- No, from the Department of Education.
- I see.
And who has the most votes?
- The DES would block it.
- Fine, get rid of them.
- What?
- Get rid of the Department of Education.
- I don't understand you.
Get rid of it, abolish it, remove it, expunge it, eliminate it, eradicate it, exterminate it!
- Get rid of it!
- Get rid of it?
- Yes.
- I couldn't do that.
- Why not?
What does it do?
- I could do that.
Local government could administer the lot.
We could have a Board of School Inspectors.
The rest could go to Environment.
I could send that house-trained idiot Henry to the House of Lords.
Golly.
I wonder what Humphrey will say.
Whatever he says, I want to be there when you tell him.
To witness the clash between the political will and the administrative will?
I think it'll be a clash between the political will and the administrative won't.
- You sent for me, Prime Minister?
- Humphrey, come in.
Sit down.
I want to bounce an idea off you.
I've realised how to reform the educational system.
Excellent, Prime Minister.
I'm going to let parents move their children to any school they want.
You mean after application, scrutiny, tribunal hearing and appeals procedures?
- No, just move them whenever they want to.
- I'm sorry.
I don't quite follow.
This government will let parents decide which schools to send their children to.
Prime Minister, you can't be serious!
- I am.
- But it's preposterous!
- Why?
- You can't expect parents to make these choices.
How on earth would parents know which schools are best?
- Which school did you go to, Humphrey?
- Winchester.
- Was it good?
- Oh, excellent, of course.
- Who chose it?
- My parents, naturally.
Now, that's different, Prime Minister.
My parents were discerning people.
You can't expect ordinary people to know where to send their children.
- Why not?
- Well, how could they tell?
They could tell if their kids could read, write and do sums and if the exam results were good.
- Exam results aren't everything.
- True.
Parents who don't want an academic education for their children can pick progressive schools.
But parents have no qualifications to make these choices.
Teachers are the professionals.
Parents are the worst people to bring up children.
They've no qualifications, no training.
You don't expect untrained teachers to teach.
The same should apply to parents.
- Before having children, they should be trained?
- No, that's no problem.
They've all been trained to HAVE kids.
Sex-education classes have been standard for some years.
Perhaps we could do better.
Before people can have children, we should make them sit exams - written and practical.
Perhaps both.
Then they could be issued with breeding licences.
Oh, very droll, Prime Minister.
No, but I'm being serious.
It's looking after children that parents are not qualified for.
That's why they have no idea which schools to choose.
It couldn't work.
What about the Health Service?
People choose their doctor without medical qualifications.
- Ah, yes, well, that's different.
- How?
Well, doctors are...
The patients aren't parents, dear lady.
Oh, really?
What makes you think that, Humpy?
Not as such.
In any case, as a matter of fact,
I think letting people choose doctors is a very bad idea, very messy.
Much tidier to allocate people to GPs, much fairer.
Then everyone has an equal chance of getting the bad doctors.
- I see.
- In any case, we're talking about education.
With respect, Prime Minister,
I think that the DES will react with some caution to your rather novel proposals.
- You mean they'll block it.
- They will give it urgent consideration and insist on a thorough and rigorous examination of all the proposals allied to a detailed feasibility study and budget analysis before producing a consultative document for consideration by all interested bodies and seeking comments and recommendations to be included in a brief
for a series of working parties who will produce individual studies which will provide the background for a more wide-ranging document considering whether or not the proposal should be taken forward to the next stage.
- You mean they'll block it.
- Yeah.
- No problem.
- We thought you'd say that.
- We have a solution.
- Oh, yes?
We'll abolish the DES.
- I'm sorry?
- We'll abolish it.
- Abolish it?
- Why not?
Abolish Education and Science?
!
- That'd be the end of civilisation as we know it!
- Only the department.
Education will flourish.
- With no government department?
Impossible!
- Departments are tombstones.
The Department of Industry marks the grave of industry, the Department of Employment, that of employment, the Department of Environment, that of the environment.
And the Department of Education marks where the corpse of British education is buried.
What does the DES do?
What's its role?
I hardly know where to begin!
It lays down guidelines, it centralises and channels money into education authorities, University Grants Committee, it sets standards!
- Does it set the curriculum?
- It would like to!
- Select and change head teachers?
- Maintain school buildings?
- No...
- Set exams?
- No...
- Does it choose the children?
- How does it affect what a child does at school?
- It supplies 60% of the cash.
Why can't the cash go from the Treasury to the schools?
Do we need 2,000 civil servants to funnel money from A to B?
The DES also creates a legislative framework for education.
Not much legislation.
Environment could do that.
They deal with other local authority matters.
You can't be serious!
Who'd assess forward planning and staffing variations, variations in pupil populations, density of schooling required in urban and rural areas?
- Who'd make sure everything ran properly?
- 2,500 private schools seem to solve these problems every day without any help from the DES.
They respond to changing circumstances.
- Supply and demand.
It's easy.
- Who would plan for the future?
Education today is what the department planned?
Well, of...
No, of course not!
- Is there anything else that the DES does?
- Well, it... it...
Well, we don't need it, then, do we?
QED.
Quod erat demonstrandum.
I really...
Quite unthinkable.
Once they start abolishing whole departments, the very foundations of civilisation crumble.
- Barbarians at the gates.
- The return of the Dark Ages.
Did anything like this crop up when you were Cabinet Secretary?
No.
We let them amalgamate departments, but that worked very well.
Yes, quite.
You keep the existing staff and you put in an extra layer of coordinating management at the top.
Exactly.
But you have to stop the liquidation of the Department of Education, Humphrey.
Have you tried discrediting the person who proposed it?
No point.
It was the Wainwright female, so he's passing it off as his own idea.
- Discrediting the facts behind it?
- It's a political idea, so facts don't come into it.
- Massaging the figures?
- No figures are involved.
But it's hard to get the Prime Minister to see that it's a bad idea.
Of course.
It's actually a very good idea.
It just mustn't happen.
I wonder if we oughtn't to play along with it - in the interests of the nation's children.
Never mind the nation's children.
What about our colleagues at the DES?
- Of course.
Sorry.
- Let's be clear about this.
The only people who'll like this idea are the parents and the children.
Everyone who counts will be against it.
- Teachers' unions.
- Local authorities.
- Educational press.
- And, of course, the DES.
- So what's the strategy?
- Unions can be counted on to disrupt the schools.
And go on TV saying the government are causing the disruption.
Good.
Local councils will threaten to turn the constituency parties against the government.
The Department of Education will delay every stage of the process and leak anything that embarrasses the government.
We can help with that at the Campaign for Freedom of Information.
Thank you, Arnold.
Ah, thanks.
But what are we actually...
Thank you, Billy.
What's our argument?
Well, obviously, that this new proposal will destroy our educational system.
- Everybody knows it's destroyed already.
- Well, we will say...
Sorry, the press will say that it's government interference in the DES that destroyed it and that this new plan will make things worse.
- Will that do the trick?
- It always has in the past.
- But this time the political pressure is stronger.
- You must find a political weapon to fight it with.
What political weapon did you have in mind, Arnold?
I?
That is your concern, Humphrey.
Your chance to prove yourself worthy of the high office to which you've been called.
- The PM's ready to see you.
- What's it about?
- The abolition of the DES, I'm afraid.
- This is going to be bloody.
- There's a minor matter I need your advice...
- Is it important?
- Not important but urgent.
- What is it?
You know that enterprise school the PM visited, when they gave him that stool?
It's just come to light that the wood they were using was stolen.
Bernard, this is hardly...
Stolen?
Yes, it was government property stolen from a YTS workshop last year.
How shocking.
It was referred to the DES, as the theft came to light at a school.
They don't know whether to prosecute.
Sorry to bother...
Don't mention it, Bernard.
Show me in.
Come in, Humphrey.
Come in, come in!
Sit down.
Only one item on the agenda today - the abolition of the DES.
Actually, if there's only one item, it's an agendum.
I don't think the Prime Minister's got as far as the second declension.
I don't mind your scoring cheap debating points since you've already lost the battle of the DES.
- The DES will be very upset.
- Does it matter since they'll cease to exist?
The process will take a few years.
They'll fight tooth and nail.
- What can they do to me?
- They're a formidable department.
- I am a formidable Prime Minister.
- Indeed you are.
But you might still need their cooperation.
Cooperation?
From the Department of Education?
Don't make me laugh!
Fine, fine.
I'll tell them to go ahead with the prosecution, then.
- What prosecution?
- Oh, it's hardly worth bothering you with.
That enterprise school where you were televised last week.
- Yes?
- The profits...
A model for other schools...
Yes, yes, go on.
- The profits were the proceeds of theft.
- Theft?
What do you mean, theft?
I mean removing goods without the knowledge or consent of the owner with the intent of...
I know what theft means.
What do YOU mean?
Well, the stool that they gave you was made from wood appropriated from the local YTS workshops.
- What do you mean?
- It was nicked.
By two of last year's pupils.
- A pair of nickers.
- Thank you, Bernard.
The YTS want to prosecute.
Now, the Department of Education could stop them.
You know, return the wood and hush it up.
Millions saw me on TV saying that school was an example!
Well, it is a sort of example.
They mustn't prosecute!
I hope the Department of Education won't leak the fact that you're covering up for crooks.
- You must tell them not to prosecute.
- That would need their cooperation.
I can just see the newspapers - "Jim's enterprising crooks.
"The Prime Minister has sat on the fence for so long that now he's become one. "
Persuade them not to prosecute.
It's very difficult to persuade people to cooperate if they are actually under a death sentence.
- Death sentence?
- If you're abolishing the department.
Oh!
Oh, that!
No, that was just... a vague idea of Dorothy's.
An idle thought.
Nothing serious.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
Splendid, Prime Minister.
Shall we now continue with the agendum?
Agendum?
Oh, yes!
We have no agendum.
We have no agendum today!
Business concluded.
All right, Humphrey?
Yes, Prime Minister.
- The Chief Whip and Party Chairman to see you.
- Take a seat.
I'll be right with you.
Bernard, take a seat.
I want you here for this meeting.
- Isn't this a party matter?
- It's also a government matter.
- It's about our education policy.
- The government's or party's?
- It's the same thing.
- With respect, they're not the same thing.
- That's why we want the meeting.
- It seems...
Bernard... sit!
Stay.
What's the problem?
- Education.
- What can I do about it?
- You're the Prime Minister.
- Yes, I know.
I have no direct control over education.
I don't control the curriculum or exams.
I don't control the choice of head teachers.
Nothing.
The voters hold you responsible for everything.
You do have influence.
I'm fed up with it.
When I became PM, I thought I'd have power.
And what have I got?
Influence.
I've got no power over the police, the rates,
EEC directives, European courts, our courts, the judges, NATO.
- What have I got the power to do?
- Lose us the next election.
Which you will if you don't tackle education.
The voters want something done about low academic attainment.
- Sex education!
- I'm not against sex education.
I'm not against children being taught the facts of life in class, but not homosexual technique!
- Or heterosexual technique, come to that.
- Where should they learn it?
Behind the bike sheds like we did!
Did you?
Never mind sexual technique.
Some of our schools are teaching more Hindi than English.
I know English is more important, but I daren't say so or I'd be accused of racism.
When I met the Ethnic Awareness Council, I happened to glance at my watch when a black woman delegate was speaking and I was accused of racist body language.
And sexist.
- I get the message.
What do you want me to do?
- Get a grip on education.
Get Henry to do something about the Department of Education.
- They've got him house-trained.
- Sack him.
I can't have another Cabinet convulsion.
- Then invite the opposition leader's wife here.
- What can she do?
Start measuring up for carpets and curtains.
Yes, right, fine.
This afternoon?
- Bernard, I believe the PM wants to see me.
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.
- What's his problem?
- Education.
Well, it's a bit late to do anything about that now.
- No, no, the education system.
- I see.
- Bit late to do anything about that either.
- He thinks he'll lose the next election.
- Worse things could befall the nation.
- He can't ignore facts.
If he can't ignore facts, he's got no business being a politician.
Anyway, Bernard, he's got nothing to worry about.
The education system does all most parents require of it.
Keeps children out of mischief while they're at work.
That paper the Party Chairman had suggests the comprehensive system is breaking down.
Bernard, I never thought to hear such language from a loyal member of the Civil Service!
- Have you been got at by the enemy?
- You mean the Russians?
No, Bernard, I mean the Prime Minister's political advisor - that Wainwright female.
- Comprehensive education ought to be validated.
- Of course, but not invalidated.
But if it was introduced to improve standards...
Whatever gave you that idea?
- You mean it was to get rid of class distinction?
- Precisely!
- So that all children...
- Children?
- Who mentioned children?
- I just...
The Department of Education never mentions children!
No, no, no, no, Bernard.
It was to get rid of class distinction in the teaching profession.
Improve the living standard of teachers, not the educational standards of children.
Bring the NUT teachers up to the salary level of their rivals in the National Association of Schoolmasters in the grammar schools.
- But the...
- When there is a Labour government, the Education Department says comprehensives abolish the class system.
When there's a Tory government, they say it's the cheapest way to provide mass education.
To Labour, we explain that selective education is divisive and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive.
That way, we have a happy relationship with the NUT and we educate our own children privately.
- But if the government wants change...
- The teaching unions don't.
Isn't it our job to persuade unions to accept government policy?
No, it is our job to get the government to accept union policy.
Since government change policy all the time and unions never change their policy at all, common sense requires that the government be brought in line with the unions.
Yes, Prime Minister?
Oh, fine.
He can see you now.
Sir Humphrey, he's very worried that he seems responsible for something he can't change.
Yes, I'm sure.
Responsibility without power - the prerogative of the eunuch throughout the ages.
- Prime Minister.
- Good morning.
What were you saying?
Nothing.
I understand you're worried about the local education authority.
- No, the Department of Education and Science.
- Indeed?
I think the DES does a splendid job.
Look what's happened to education.
This is a question from a Religious Studies paper.
"Which do you prefer - atom bombs or charity?"
Even maths is politicised.
"If it costs £5 billion a year to maintain Britain's nuclear defences
"and £75 a year to feed a starving African child,
"how many children could be saved from starvation
"if the Ministry of Defence abandoned nuclear weapons?"
That's easy.
None.
They'd spend it all on conventional weapons.
In any case, it's just a sum.
Five billion divided by 75.
But children aren't learning to do the sums.
The local education authorities might argue that they don't need to.
They have calculators.
They all need to know HOW it's done.
We were all taught basis arithmetic, weren't we?
Were we?
What's 3,947 divided by 73?
Er...
Oh, I'd need a pencil and paper to do that.
No, never mind that.
- I could do it when I left school.
- Now you'd use a calculator.
That's not the point.
Look at Latin.
Hardly anybody knows that now.
Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.
What?
- Times change and we change with the times.
- Precisely.
- Si tacuisses, philosophus manisses.
- What does that mean?
If you'd kept your mouth shut, we might have thought you were clever.
- I beg your pardon?
- Not you, Prime Minister.
That's the translation.
No one would have thought Sir Humphrey was saying that about you.
Go away, Bernard, please.
I can't believe it.
You had a strict academic upbringing.
Are you denying the value of it?
What's the use of it?
I can't even call upon it in conversation with the PM of Great Britain!
Education in this country is a disaster.
We're supposed to prepare children for work.
Most of the time they're bored stiff.
I should've thought that being bored stiff was an excellent preparation for work.
The school leaving age was raised to 16, but they're learning less.
We didn't raise it so they'd learn more but to keep teenagers off the job market and hold down unemployment figures.
Are you saying there's nothing wrong with education?
Of course not.
It's a joke.
It's always been a joke.
By leaving it in the hands of local councillors, it will remain a joke.
Half of them are your enemies and the other half are the sort of friends that make you prefer your enemies.
- What are you saying?
- That education will never get any better as long as it's subject to all that tomfoolery in the town halls.
Imagine what would happen if you put defence in their hands.
- Defence?
- Give councils £100 million each and ask them to defend themselves, we'd have a civil war in three weeks!
- You're being silly.
- Am I?
That's what's happened to education.
And why?
Because nobody thinks education is serious the way defence is serious.
So that's why civil defence is in local authority hands?
Of course.
Because everybody knows it's a joke.
You just don't leave important matters in the hands of those clowns!
And as you've left education to them, one must assume that, until now, you have attached little importance to it.
It is important.
It could lose me the next election.
Ah!
In my naivety, I thought you were concerned about the future of our children.
Yes, that too.
After all, they get the vote at 18.
Then, Prime Minister, then centralise.
Take it away from the local councils.
Put it under the Department of Education, then you could do something about it.
Do you think I could?
Grasp the nettle, take the bull by the horns?
You can't take the bull by the horns if you're grasping the nettle.
Oh, really, Bernard?
By grasping the nettle with one hand, you could take the bull by one horn with the other hand, but not both horns because your hand isn't big enough.
If you did take the bull by one horn, it would be rather dangerous because...
Well, it was just a mixed metaphor and since we were discussing education, I...
- (BUZZER)
- Thank God!
Yes?
Your political advisor's outside.
- Send her in, Bernard.
Humphrey, thank you.
- Thank you.
- You've given me much food for thought.
- In that case, Prime Minister, bon appétit.
Dear lady.
- Yes, Dorothy?
- My notes for your tour of the north-west.
Visits to hospitals and factories.
- Drumming up votes in marginal constituencies.
- No!
- Why not?
- I'm coming with you if it's a government tour.
If it's canvassing marginals, I can't come and the Treasury can't pay.
It's a government visit.
It's coincidence that all the stop-offs are in marginals.
- Well, that's all right, then.
- That's OK.
What can I do about education?
Quickly.
- You mean do or appear to do?
- Appear to do.
I can't do, obviously.
Well, in the short term, we could get you on TV associated with something good and successful.
- Is there something?
- I had thought of this for your schedule.
- You could fit it in.
- St Margaret's School Young Enterprise Scheme.
It's set up its own manufacturing company.
They make cheeseboards, paperweights, toast racks, sell them and track the operation in their business-study classes.
- They involve local businessmen.
Parents help.
- Does it cost a lot?
- No, it makes a profit.
- Isn't it teaching them to be rather grasping?
- No, they give the money to local charity.
- Fine, I'll do it.
Make sure the TV crews have plenty of time to cover me... er... cover the event properly.
Write me a speech with a snappy, 20-second piece for the news bulletins.
- That should win back a few seats.
- Prime Minister.
Er, give a lead to those responsible for the nation's education, Bernard.
Of course, Prime Minister.
(NEWSREADER) Finally, the PM visited St Margaret's School on his north-western tour.
The school has set up a manufacturing business where the children make a variety of goods for sale in the local community.
The children do their own sales and marketing and use the experience they gain as a basis for their maths and business studies.
The Prime Minister was presented with an example of the school's output.
In conclusion, I must congratulate you on all the hard work, the discipline and the success of your enterprise.
You've set an example in British education which other schools would do well to follow.
We need more schools like St Margaret's and I shall always treasure your present.
No Prime Minister ever lost a seat if he could help itl
(NEWSREADER) And that was the six o'clock news from the BBC.
- I thought that was OK, didn't you?
- Fine.
- My joke went down well.
- MY joke!
Better than Channel 4 coverage.
They didn't describe it as the PM's tour of the north-west.
They said, "Jim Hacker touring the marginal constituencies."
- That's true, isn't it?
- But they shouldn't say it.
It's biased reporting!
- Reporting the facts?
- Nothing wrong with visiting the marginals.
- What they said was still true.
- It was still biased to say it!
I'm not interested in your paranoia.
I was interested in that school.
- Parents queue up to get their children into it.
- Pity they can't all get in.
Coffee?
- Lovely.
- Why can't more parents send children there?
- No room.
- There is.
School numbers are falling.
- That'd mean poaching the other schools.
- So what?
The other schools would have to close.
Great!
St Margaret's could take over their buildings.
- Darling, that wouldn't be fair.
- Who to?
- The teachers in the schools that had to close.
- Good ones could teach at the popular schools.
What about the bad teachers?
It wouldn't be fair on them.
What about the children, or are the bad teachers' jobs more important?
Darling, it's... it's no good.
Who's to say who are the bad teachers?
It just wouldn't work.
- Why not?
- Well... it wouldn't work.
- Why not?
- What do you mean?
Suppose schools were like doctors.
In the NHS, you choose which doctor to go to, don't you?
- Yes.
- And he gets paid per patient.
Why don't we do the same with schools?
Have a National Education Service.
Parents could choose the schools and the schools get paid per pupil.
- Exactly!
- There'd be an outcry.
- From the parents?
- No, from the Department of Education.
- I see.
And who has the most votes?
- The DES would block it.
- Fine, get rid of them.
- What?
- Get rid of the Department of Education.
- I don't understand you.
Get rid of it, abolish it, remove it, expunge it, eliminate it, eradicate it, exterminate it!
- Get rid of it!
- Get rid of it?
- Yes.
- I couldn't do that.
- Why not?
What does it do?
- I could do that.
Local government could administer the lot.
We could have a Board of School Inspectors.
The rest could go to Environment.
I could send that house-trained idiot Henry to the House of Lords.
Golly.
I wonder what Humphrey will say.
Whatever he says, I want to be there when you tell him.
To witness the clash between the political will and the administrative will?
I think it'll be a clash between the political will and the administrative won't.
- You sent for me, Prime Minister?
- Humphrey, come in.
Sit down.
I want to bounce an idea off you.
I've realised how to reform the educational system.
Excellent, Prime Minister. (CLAPS HIS HANDS)
I'm going to let parents move their children to any school they want.
You mean after application, scrutiny, tribunal hearing and appeals procedures?
- No, just move them whenever they want to.
- I'm sorry.
I don't quite follow.
This government will let parents decide which schools to send their children to.
Prime Minister, you can't be serious!
- I am.
- But it's preposterous!
- Why?
- You can't expect parents to make these choices.
How on earth would parents know which schools are best?
- Which school did you go to, Humphrey?
- Winchester.
- Was it good?
- Oh, excellent, of course.
- Who chose it?
- My parents, naturally.
Now, that's different, Prime Minister.
My parents were discerning people.
You can't expect ordinary people to know where to send their children.
- Why not?
- Well, how could they tell?
They could tell if their kids could read, write and do sums and if the exam results were good.
- Exam results aren't everything.
- True.
Parents who don't want an academic education for their children can pick progressive schools.
But parents have no qualifications to make these choices.
Teachers are the professionals.
Parents are the worst people to bring up children.
They've no qualifications, no training.
You don't expect untrained teachers to teach.
The same should apply to parents.
- Before having children, they should be trained?
- No, that's no problem.
They've all been trained to HAVE kids.
Sex-education classes have been standard for some years.
Perhaps we could do better.
Before people can have children, we should make them sit exams - written and practical.
Perhaps both.
Then they could be issued with breeding licences.
Oh, very droll, Prime Minister.
No, but I'm being serious.
It's looking after children that parents are not qualified for.
That's why they have no idea which schools to choose.
It couldn't work.
What about the Health Service?
People choose their doctor without medical qualifications.
- Ah, yes, well, that's different.
- How?
Well, doctors are...
The patients aren't parents, dear lady.
Oh, really?
What makes you think that, Humpy?
Not as such.
In any case, as a matter of fact,
I think letting people choose doctors is a very bad idea, very messy.
Much tidier to allocate people to GPs, much fairer.
Then everyone has an equal chance of getting the bad doctors.
- I see.
- In any case, we're talking about education.
With respect, Prime Minister,
I think that the DES will react with some caution to your rather novel proposals.
- You mean they'll block it.
- They will give it urgent consideration and insist on a thorough and rigorous examination of all the proposals allied to a detailed feasibility study and budget analysis before producing a consultative document for consideration by all interested bodies and seeking comments and recommendations to be included in a brief
for a series of working parties who will produce individual studies which will provide the background for a more wide-ranging document considering whether or not the proposal should be taken forward to the next stage.
- You mean they'll block it.
- Yeah.
- No problem.
- We thought you'd say that.
- We have a solution.
- Oh, yes?
We'll abolish the DES.
- I'm sorry?
- We'll abolish it.
- Abolish it?
- Why not?
Abolish Education and Science?
!
- That'd be the end of civilisation as we know it!
- Only the department.
Education will flourish.
- With no government department?
Impossible!
- Departments are tombstones.
The Department of Industry marks the grave of industry, the Department of Employment, that of employment, the Department of Environment, that of the environment.
And the Department of Education marks where the corpse of British education is buried.
What does the DES do?
What's its role?
I hardly know where to begin!
It lays down guidelines, it centralises and channels money into education authorities, University Grants Committee, it sets standards!
- Does it set the curriculum?
- It would like to!
- Select and change head teachers?
- Maintain school buildings?
- No...
- Set exams?
- No...
- Does it choose the children?
- How does it affect what a child does at school?
- It supplies 60% of the cash.
Why can't the cash go from the Treasury to the schools?
Do we need 2,000 civil servants to funnel money from A to B?
The DES also creates a legislative framework for education.
Not much legislation.
Environment could do that.
They deal with other local authority matters.
You can't be serious!
Who'd assess forward planning and staffing variations, variations in pupil populations, density of schooling required in urban and rural areas?
- Who'd make sure everything ran properly?
- 2,500 private schools seem to solve these problems every day without any help from the DES.
They respond to changing circumstances.
- Supply and demand.
It's easy.
- Who would plan for the future?
Education today is what the department planned?
Well, of...
No, of course not!
- Is there anything else that the DES does?
- Well, it... it...
Well, we don't need it, then, do we?
QED.
Quod erat demonstrandum.
I really...
Quite unthinkable.
Once they start abolishing whole departments, the very foundations of civilisation crumble.
- Barbarians at the gates.
- The return of the Dark Ages.
Did anything like this crop up when you were Cabinet Secretary?
No.
We let them amalgamate departments, but that worked very well.
Yes, quite.
You keep the existing staff and you put in an extra layer of coordinating management at the top.
Exactly.
But you have to stop the liquidation of the Department of Education, Humphrey.
Have you tried discrediting the person who proposed it?
No point.
It was the Wainwright female, so he's passing it off as his own idea.
- Discrediting the facts behind it?
- It's a political idea, so facts don't come into it.
- Massaging the figures?
- No figures are involved.
But it's hard to get the Prime Minister to see that it's a bad idea.
Of course.
It's actually a very good idea.
It just mustn't happen.
I wonder if we oughtn't to play along with it - in the interests of the nation's children.
Never mind the nation's children.
What about our colleagues at the DES?
- Of course.
Sorry.
- Let's be clear about this.
The only people who'll like this idea are the parents and the children.
Everyone who counts will be against it.
- Teachers' unions.
- Local authorities.
- Educational press.
- And, of course, the DES.
- So what's the strategy?
- Unions can be counted on to disrupt the schools.
And go on TV saying the government are causing the disruption.
Good.
Local councils will threaten to turn the constituency parties against the government.
The Department of Education will delay every stage of the process and leak anything that embarrasses the government.
We can help with that at the Campaign for Freedom of Information.
Thank you, Arnold.
Ah, thanks.
But what are we actually...
Thank you, Billy.
What's our argument?
Well, obviously, that this new proposal will destroy our educational system.
- Everybody knows it's destroyed already.
- Well, we will say...
Sorry, the press will say that it's government interference in the DES that destroyed it and that this new plan will make things worse.
- Will that do the trick?
- It always has in the past.
- But this time the political pressure is stronger.
- You must find a political weapon to fight it with.
What political weapon did you have in mind, Arnold?
I?
That is your concern, Humphrey.
Your chance to prove yourself worthy of the high office to which you've been called.
- The PM's ready to see you.
- What's it about?
- The abolition of the DES, I'm afraid.
- This is going to be bloody.
- There's a minor matter I need your advice...
- Is it important?
- Not important but urgent.
- What is it?
You know that enterprise school the PM visited, when they gave him that stool?
It's just come to light that the wood they were using was stolen.
Bernard, this is hardly...
Stolen?
Yes, it was government property stolen from a YTS workshop last year.
How shocking.
It was referred to the DES, as the theft came to light at a school.
They don't know whether to prosecute.
Sorry to bother...
Don't mention it, Bernard.
Show me in.
Come in, Humphrey.
Come in, come in!
Sit down.
Only one item on the agenda today - the abolition of the DES.
Actually, if there's only one item, it's an agendum.
I don't think the Prime Minister's got as far as the second declension.
I don't mind your scoring cheap debating points since you've already lost the battle of the DES.
- The DES will be very upset.
- Does it matter since they'll cease to exist?
The process will take a few years.
They'll fight tooth and nail.
- What can they do to me?
- They're a formidable department.
- I am a formidable Prime Minister.
- Indeed you are.
But you might still need their cooperation.
Cooperation?
From the Department of Education?
Don't make me laugh!
Fine, fine.
I'll tell them to go ahead with the prosecution, then.
- What prosecution?
- Oh, it's hardly worth bothering you with.
That enterprise school where you were televised last week.
- Yes?
- The profits...
A model for other schools...
Yes, yes, go on.
- The profits were the proceeds of theft.
- Theft?
What do you mean, theft?
I mean removing goods without the knowledge or consent of the owner with the intent of...
I know what theft means.
What do YOU mean?
Well, the stool that they gave you was made from wood appropriated from the local YTS workshops.
- What do you mean?
- It was nicked.
By two of last year's pupils.
- A pair of nickers.
- Thank you, Bernard.
The YTS want to prosecute.
Now, the Department of Education could stop them.
You know, return the wood and hush it up.
Millions saw me on TV saying that school was an example!
Well, it is a sort of example.
They mustn't prosecute!
I hope the Department of Education won't leak the fact that you're covering up for crooks.
- You must tell them not to prosecute.
- That would need their cooperation.
I can just see the newspapers - "Jim's enterprising crooks.
"The Prime Minister has sat on the fence for so long that now he's become one."
Persuade them not to prosecute.
It's very difficult to persuade people to cooperate if they are actually under a death sentence.
- Death sentence?
- If you're abolishing the department.
Oh!
Oh, that!
No, that was just... a vague idea of Dorothy's.
An idle thought.
Nothing serious.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
Splendid, Prime Minister.
Shall we now continue with the agendum?
Agendum?
Oh, yes!
We have no agendum.
(RHYTHMICALLY) We have no agendum today!
Business concluded.
All right, Humphrey?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Payday, payday.
Sam, Carla, Woody.
Oh, come to Papa, baby.
Boy, have I got plans for you.
CLIFF:
Yeah, no kidding, Woody?
What are you going to do with it?
Put it in the bank.
Whoo, don't get arrested, buddy.
Hey, Shoulder Pads, freeze.
Yes, Carla?
I seem to be a little short.
Yes, but you have a warm personality.
When you added up my paycheck,
I think you forgot to count a couple of fingers and toes.
Oh, I'm afraid I had to dock you a total of two and three quarters hours for being late last week.
I had good excuses.
Three deaths in the family since Monday?
It's been a bad week.
Carla, Carla, here's a little time management trick that I use.
I set my watch ahead a half an hour.
That way, when I think I'm getting someplace on time,
I'm actually fooling myself into getting there early.
Hey, you know, that makes good business sense, boss.
I guess if I set my watch an hour ahead, it'd be twice as good, huh?
Right.
Hey, what do you know?
It's lunch time.
No wonder I'm so hungry.

What you reading, Cliffie?
Oh, the, uh, Massachusetts Scientific Journal.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, this, uh, magazine is sent to some of the most prestigious and high-minded intellectuals in the greater metropolitan area.
How come you have it?
Some guy on my route left town and uh, didn't leave a forwarding address.
Oh, hey, Carla, looky here.
It says the Britain Institute's doing research on twins.
Maybe you can get your gruesome twosome in there, eh?
Yeah, right, like I got nothing better to do than schlep Little Elvis and Jesse around.
Especially so some pointy-heads can plug electrodes into their skulls to see what makes them slobber.
That's too bad;
they're offering, uh, 50 bucks apiece.
I always wondered what makes them slobber.
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Sam?
He's upstairs having lunch with Evan Dreck.
Oh, God, Mr. Drake shows up on a day that I'm late?
Well, don't worry.
I've covered for you.
Told him you were drunk.
What does this mean?
When did Evan start taking Sam to lunch?
When did the two of them become good friends?
When did I start talking to myself?
Hey, maybe he's going to put Sam in charge of the bar again.
What?
Don't make me laugh.
Sam, I'm serious about that offer.
Now, I want to move you up.
What do you say?
Oh, sounds tempting.
DRAKE:
When I see you behind that bar, the more convinced I am your talents are being wasted.
Yeah, I know, I know, but they won't let me bring a bed in here.
( both chuckling )
Yes, yes, boy, thank you; of course I will.
I, uh, I'll get the ball rolling.
Hello, Mr. Drake.
It's so wonderful to see you again.
Yeah, I'm going to use your phone.
You scum-sucking, power-hungry, backbiting creep.
You stole my job.
Ah, come on.
That's not true.
But I will bite your back for you if you want.
Oh, well, then, what were you talking to Evan about?
He just offered me an executive position down at headquarters.
You scum-sucking, power-hungry, backbiting creep!
Hi, Mr. Drake.
I was just congratulating Sam.
Great.
Uh, it's all set, Sam.
Hey, uh, listen.
Uh, I'm really excited about this, but are you sure that I'm qualified?
I mean, you know, I never even finished college.
How far did you get?
Halfway through the application.
I still have it here if you...
Nah, that's okay.
You're qualified.
See you tomorrow.
All right.
Whoo.
Something funny is going on here.
Why did he hire Sam?
Why is he making him an executive?
What's the matter with me?
Well, for one thing, Miss Howe, you talk to yourself an awful lot.
Hmm.
Mr. Malone, I hate to rush you, but people are waiting.
Have you made a decision yet?
Yes, Mimi, I have.
I'll take the tuna on toast with iced tea.
Done.
Oh, and, uh, after lunch, we'll, uh, finish the memo I was drafting.
Where did we leave off?
"To whom it may concern."
Boy, I like the way that sounds.
( door shuts )
( chuckling )
( grinding )
( buzzer )
MIMI:
Mr. Malone, some gentlemen are here to see you from the firm of Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.
Peterson, Clavin and Boyd, Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.
Uh, Mimi, tell them I'm in an important meeting and can't see them, please.
( guys complaining )
Hey, get in here, you mugs!
( laughing and exclaiming )
Uh, Sam, don't be nice, now.
If you really have a meeting, we don't want to bother you.
No, no, oh, come on.
Get in here.
Get in here.
Well, major corporate digs, buddy, eh?
Talk about your office in the sky.
Hey, oh, hey, lookit down here.
There's a guy washing windows.
Ooh.
That's one job you wouldn't catch me doing for all the bridges in Bridgeport.
( chuckling )
Standing on a platform there, suspended hundreds of feet over certain death.
You said it.
Hey, let's throw something at him and scare him, eh?
( Sam laughing )
Hey, you know, actually, uh, these, uh, windows don't open.
You're in a what's called a climate- controlled office.
( chuckling )
Very impressed, Sam, eh?
Oh, hey, Sammy, you do look every inch the corporate muckety-muck there, doesn't he?
Well, you know, I don't want to brag.
Mimi, get in here and brag for me, will you?
( laughter )
Just kidding, Mimi.
While I have you, Mr. Drake is on his way over.
Oh, guys,
I'm sorry, men, uh... ( blows softly )
Oh, yeah, sure.
That's okay.
That's all right.
Uh, we're running late for our next appointment anyway, boys.
Where is that?
It's at the bottom of the lobby escalator watching the secretaries go up to the lunchroom.
( guys chortling )
All aboard for the Underalls Express, now leaving Track 29.
( guys imitating train whistle )
( laughing ):
You mugs!
( knocking )
Ah, Sam.
Oh, hey, Evan.
I'm sorry.
I was engrossed in my work here.
Just came to check on you.
How you doing?
Looks like you're making yourself at home here.
Desk.
Supplies, huh?
And the requisite picture of your, uh... self.
It's not really a great one, but it's the only big one I had.
Yeah, well...
You're all set then, huh?
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Full steam ahead.
Take no prisoners.
Excellent.
All right.
You know, I, uh...
I do have, uh, one little question, though.
Shoot.
W-What do I do?
Ah, yes, well, now, yours being a newly created position, your responsibilities as yet are not clearly defined.
Well, uh, that helps, that helps.
But we're looking for your input.
Input-- got you;
all right, input.
Yeah, well, listen,
I'm going to be late for lunch, so, uh, we'll talk later at softball practice, huh?
Oh, hey, you got a softball team, huh?
Oh, yeah, all the corporations do.
It's a lot of fun, very casual.
Wear cleats.
Hey, I'll have lots of input for you then, sir.
Okay, all right.
Input, input.
Let's see, here.
( sighing )
( exhaling )
( grinding )
( grinding continues )
Mimi, call Maintenance.
( muttering ) Ridiculous.
Stupid Sam.
Executive?
( muttering continues )
I'm sorry.
Are you talking to me?
No, I was talking to my...
Yes, I was.
So, you say that they did make Sam an executive?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Giving him the red carpet treatment over there.
He's a regular Armand Hammer.
Oh, that reminds me.
I got to change the baking soda in my refrigerator.
Hi, everybody.
I just got back from twin testing, and I would like to announce that I now like science
100 bucks more than I used to.
Hey, all right.
I found out that Little Elvis is a lot more aggressive in certain situations than Jesse.
Or is it vice versa?
Ah, who cares?
Not these twins.
( chortling )
Whoa.
( whooping and laughing )
People, I have an announcement!
Mr. Sam Malone, the newest member of the corporate softball team, just pitched a shutout against General Electric!
( whooping and yelling )
I'd say I loved pinning back the ears of a Fortune 500 company.
Kind of makes you feel proud to be part of the corporation, doesn't it?
Rah-rah-rah.
Hey, you know, I never knew that you were a cheerleader.
Although I have always admired your pom-poms.
Sam, uh, why does your jersey say "Heppel" on the back?
Oh, that was some guy who used to work for the company.
They haven't had time to order mine yet.
Supply problems.
"Supply problems." Yeah.
Yes, that happens a lot in large corporations.
You know, Sam, they were really lucky to get you on the team.
You want to know how lucky?
They just made the playoffs the day before they hired me.
( chuckling )
Oh, my...!
I finally figured it out.
Life makes sense, and I am not crazy.
Well, that's only a layman's opinion.
Sam is a ringer.
Evan just hired him to win the championship.
In two weeks, he'll be out of there.
Now, Rebecca, you can't tell him that.
At least let the man enjoy his day in the sun.
( laughing and chatting )
All right.
Sam has taken enough hard knocks this year.
No, it's pleasure enough for me to just know.
I won't break his heart.
Oh, hey, uh, Rebecca, the guys decided that you could be our cheerleader on one condition.
Lose the bra.
( raucous laughter )
I won't break his heart.
I will rip it from his chest.
( laughs )
Here are those copies of your report, Mr. Malone.
Oh, great.
You got colored paper.
Oh.
Hey, hey.
Look at that.
Lots of input.
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh, hey, Rebecca.
No, come on in.
Thank you, Mimi.
Well, Rebecca... welcome to the, uh, executive office.
Would you like to have a seat in the executive chair there?
Or maybe on the executive sofa?
Or how 'bout the executive lap?
( cackling )
( cackling )
( cackling stops )
No, but, uh, seriously, uh, what-what brings you down to corporate?
Oh, I have a little information about your promotion that I'm going to really enjoy sharing with you.
Oh, yeah.
Listen.
Before you do, there's something
I want to talk to you about, too.
Uh, sit down, please, sit down.
( sighs )
Uh...
I just want to say tha-that I'm sorry, you know, for teasing you the way I did and everything.
I know we both had a lot of fun with it, but i-it wasn't right.
That's okay.
I just wanted...
No, no, no.
See, it, it wasn't okay.
I mean, absolutely not.
I...
I think I was just trying to, you know, show off in front of the guys.
Truth is... this is all kind of new to me.
I keep expecting somebody to come through the door and say,
"Malone, job's over.
You're through.
"Get out of here," and it's a big joke.
Good.
Is it my turn now?
No, in a second, in a second.
You know, the, uh... first thing that I did-- when I was alone in the office here--
I, uh, called my father, who I hadn't talked to for over three years.
And when I told him where I was sitting, you know, what I was looking out at, and, uh, what, what my title is... ( sighs ) for the first time ever, he told me how proud he was of me.
( chuckling ):
Anyway.
Whoa!
Uh, what-what are you dying to tell me here?
( clears throat )
Just that we are darn proud of you, too.
Oh, thank you!
God, that's great.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, get a load of this.
My folks, uh-- their wedding anniversary is next month.
I'm gonna fly them in here, and I'm gonna give them the grand tour.
I just can't wait to see their faces.
Stop.
What?
Sam...
I didn't want to have to tell you this, but now I have to.
All right, all right,
What do you got?
No, I actually did want to have to tell you this, but I wanted to enjoy it, and now you've ruined that, and I have to tell you anyway.
You're not gonna be here next month.
What do you mean?
Malone, you're a ringer.
( gasps ) Ooh, I did like doing it a little bit.
Wh-What do you mean, ringer?
I mean that Evan just hired you to win the championship.
And when that's over, you're history.
Oh, boy.
I should have expected this.
Sam, it's just the way of the business world.
No, no, no, no.
I mean, that you are jealous.
How petty of you.
I can't believe this.
You know, the fact that I played baseball has nothing to do with this job.
I am a good executive.
And, you know, you are way off base, and I'm gonna prove it to you.
Mimi, get-get Mr. Drake on the phone right away.
Right away, Mr. Malone.
Sam, you don't have to do this.
You know, I was hired for a lot of reasons.
Like what?
Yeah, I'll tell you, "like what,"
like this report, for example.
This sucker is loaded with input.
Sam, as one friend to another,
I really am just trying to do you a favor.
( buzzing )
Mr. Drake is still in a sales meeting.
What do you mean, a sales meeting?
Why aren't I there?
I-I'm the Eastern...
the Western...
I-I'm the Southwest...
I'm the "Eastern Regional Sales Manager."
I don't know, but he said to rest up your arm because you're starting tonight.
Well, there's just probably some mix-up.
You know, maybe I missed a memo or something.
I'm gonna go, uh, straighten this out right now.
( clears throat )
Don't you have a job to go to or something?
( sighs )
( cackling )
( cackling continues )
Mimi, call Maintenance.
All right, have your people coordinate with Marketing.
We'll get this campaign on the boards.
Will do.
Sorry I'm late.
I guess that about wraps it up.
Uh, say, before you go,
I just want to say that I'm really backed up with paperwork, and I won't be able to make the game tonight.
What?
What?
Can't make the game?
Hey, wait a minute, Evan.
I-I didn't give up my office two weeks to let this guy do paperwork.
Easy, Heppel.
Heppel?
What?
You're Heppel?
But...
I thought that you were supposed... ( murmuring )
Oh, boy.
I-I am a ringer.
That's right.
I'm right, aren't I, that I'm a ringer?
Well, I'll be straight with you, Sam.
Sure, we originally hired you to pitch for the softball team, but, uh, actually, you've turned out to be somewhat of a surprise.
Oh?
Yeah, yeah, you're a much better hitter than we anticipated.
( all agreeing )
( indistinct praises )
Come on.
Man, this really bites it.
I mean, here I thought you wanted me for my mind, and it turns out you just wanted me for my body.
Where have I heard that before?
( clears throat )
Is it really that bad, Sam?
I mean, you make good money.
Everyone around here likes you.
What's the problem?
The problem is that, you know, as soon as softball season's over,
I'm out of here.
You don't have to be.
We'll find a place for you.
I mean, uh, softball season next year.
No, no, no.
You know, if I'm gonna stay here,
I want it to be for legitimate reasons.
I mean, come on, Evan, at least look at my report.
Now, if you think that I have what it takes, you know, after looking at that, to be an executive right here, right now, the way I am, then, you know, then fine.
But otherwise, I think you know, we should just shake hands like gentlemen and part company.
Ho!
Lock up your women!
Sammy's back.
( all greeting )
Sam, you know, I'm sorry to hear about the termination there, buddy.
Yeah, tough luck, pal.
Yeah.
Hey, easy come, easy go.
No, truth is, it was a shock, but then I, uh...
( clears throat )
I went into the executive washroom, and I splashed some water on my face, and I looked in the mirror, and the mirror looked back and said,
"You're not an executive, man.
Get back to where you belong."
All right.
Yeah.
Smart there.
I thought they only had mirrors like that in the movies.
It's good to be back.
Oh, Miss Howe will sure be relieved.
Yeah?
She said that you'd be shattered and we should all be really nice to you.
She did, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Well... maybe I ought to go set her mind at ease.
Ooh.
( knocking )
Hi, Rebecca.
Oh.
How are you, Sam?
Well, I'm kind of... shattered.
I was afraid you might be.
( groans ) Do you mind if I stand here for just a little while?
It's kind of hard for me to go back out there after what happened.
( clears throat )
I feel so humiliated.
You just take as long as you need.
Would you like to talk about it?
You mean about how bad I feel?
Yeah, you know, sometimes that helps.
Well, I feel pretty bad.
So... bad.
I know.
And I feel terrible that I had to tell you.
Oh, well there's no sense in us both feeling so bad.
Oh, God.
I just hate to see you like this.
Oh... oh.
You know...
Hmm?
sometimes these things happen.
But you will always have your job here.
Oh, it's not just losing the job.
It's that I was, you know, taken advantage of.
I know.
I know.
You know, that I was used, that I was just, you know, manipulated by somebody who just cynically wanted to... get something from me.
Malone, what are you doing?
I-I'm feeling bad.
No, you are feeling pretty good.
Okay, I admit it.
I'm not a sad guy.
I'm a happy, horny guy.
You know... we need pity, too.
Oh, God, you are choice, Malone.
You are just really choice.
You will do anything for a roll in the hay.
If you will play on my sympathies, then you will stoop to anything.
God, I am tired of fighting you.
I just don't have the strength to do it anymore.
If this is what you really want, then by all means.
Take me here.
Take me now.
Please, please.
Are you serious?
Oh, yes.
I want it bad.
Well, all right.
Is something wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.
Le-Let me get this straight.
Is this what I can expect in the way of full participation?
Until I get tired.
( Sam grunts )
REBECCA:
Was it good for you?
to a dreadful dynasty of vicious vampire ducks.
The Counts of Duckula!
Legend has it that these fowl beings can be destroyed... by a stake through the heart or exposure to sunlight.
This does not suffice, however... for they may be brought back to life... by means of a sacred rite... that can be performed once a century... when the moon is in the eighth house of Aquarius!
- Batswing blood.
- I'll get it!
The latest reincarnation did not run according to plan.
Ooh!
In the heart of Transylvania
In the Vampire Hall of Fame, yeah
There's not a vampire zanier than
Duckula
He won't bite beast or man
'Cause he's a vegetarian
And things never run to plan for
Duckula
If you're lookin' for some fun
You can always count upon
The wild and wacky one they call
Duckula
Heh heh!
Count Duckula!
Heh heh heh!
Amidst the jagged peaks of bonny Scotland... an evil hitherto unknown in these parts... creeps slowly through the gloaming.
What a place to get a flat.
How much longer are you gonna be, Igor?
I'm doing my best, sir.
I never was mechanically minded.
And our selection of tools leaves a lot to be desired.
Never mind excuses, Igor.
It's lucky we had Nanny to use as a jack.
Are you all right, Nanny?
Oh, I'm fine Master Duckula... but I can't see no sign of Jack.
Oh, dear.
Oh, well, that's the best I can do, milord.
You can come out now, Nanny... or I fear it'll break down again in a couple of miles.
Don't be such a misery, Igor.
And come on... we'll never get to the Glen Sparrows Hotel at this rate.
Yes, sir.
All aboard.
But I do wish, sir, that we had come to Scotland... in the traditional way...
by castle.
I told you it was due for a service, Igor.
Besides, all my monster-detecting gear... is scientifically built into this trailer.
Oh, dear, I'll never get supper ready... with all this junk around.
Junk, Nanny?
Oh, that's high technology... macrosensitive monster-monitoring machinery.
I, Count Duckula... am about to prove the existence of the Loch Ness Monster.
Oh, really, sir.
How a vampire duck of your breeding... can believe in that Loch Ness monster story.
Just keep your eye on the road, Igor.
I can't wait to get to Glen Sparrows Hotel.
Look at that.
Every room has it's own four-poster bed... a jacuzzi, and a putting green.
Should get a little golf in between monster tracking.
See that you polish my five iron and iron my plus fours.
Very good, milord.
The Glen Sparrows Hotel.
Little does he know that I shall take him to McCastle McDuckula... home of his father's father's uncle's uncle...
Rory McDuckula, the scourge of the Glens.
There he would at last lead my master... into the powers of evil that he has for so long resisted.
Look, Igor.
Are you quite sure this is the Glen Sparrows Hotel?
I hope you're not doubting my efficiency, milord.
No, no, no, no, no.
Only it doesn't look anything like the brochure.
You know what these travel firms are like, sir.
Yeah, well... right.
- Nanny?
- Yes, Master Duckula?
Stable the werewolf, will you?
Yes, Master Duckula.
Get the stable lad to give you a hand.
He'll be pretty hungry after that journey.
Extremely hungry.
Get him to give you a leg as well, Nanny.
Very good, Mr. Igor.
I shall bring your bags in, milord.
Would you like...
Hold on, hold on!
Where are ye frae?
I knew you'd taken a wrong turning, Igor.
We're in Siberia.
That, sir, is Scots.
Scots?
Do you mean that's how they talk in these parts?
I'm afraid so, milord.
Where are ye frae?
Where are ye frae?
Ah, I see what you're getting at.
You want to know where our fray is.
Excuse me while I ask my man.
I don't concern myself with things like that.
Igor, Igor, what on earth is a fray?
I think you'll find, sir... that he wishes to know where we are from.
Oi, where are ye frae?
This is Count Duckula of Transylvania... and I am his butler, Igor.
And you'll be the hotel manager, right?
Whisht awa' bickering' brattle.
Lang may your Sauchiehall Street.
Yes.
Well, if you don't mind, I'll just call you Jock.
I wonder if I might just have a word with you.
Mutter, mutter, mutter, mutter, mutter...
- Count Duckula.
- Oh, aye?
Mutter, mutter, mutter, nephew's nephew's son's son.
Jangs!
Mutter, mutter, mutter, Glen Sparrows Hotel.
- Oh, aye.
- Mutter, mutter, mutter, pretend.
Mutter, mutter, mutter, manager.
Oh, aye.
Aye.
A fearfully refined good day to Your Lordship.
Terribly honored that you have seen fit... to stay in our humble wee hotel.
Great Scot!
Oh, sorry.
I understood pretty well every word he said.
Oh, aye, sir.
You'll soon get the hang of it.
Now, would you care to follow me?
And I'll show you the rooms what we have prepared for you.
Oh, "what he has".
He speaks wonderful English.
Bring the bags, will you, Nanny?
Right you are, Master Duckula.
No, Nanny.
No, Nanny!
Take them out of the trailer first.
Oh, silly old me.
I thought this was supposed to be a four-poster.
Aye, this is one of our famous four-poster bedrooms.
But the bed's not a four-poster.
Oh, no, sir.
The bedroom is.
There's a poster on each wall.
Look!
This is ridiculous.
What about the jacuzzi?
Oh, we don't get any trouble from that sort of person here, sir.
Eh?
No, no.
The whirlpool bath.
Oh, that sir.
Well, there's a wash basin there... with a stainless steel egg whisk.
Oh, really, I can't!
Ah, I see you do at least have the putting green.
Oh, yes, sir.
Pass me my putter, Igor.
Here we are, sir.
Right.
I wonder if I could have a golf ball.
Oh, certainly.
Here we are, sir.
Saxpence.
- Saxpence?
- Saxpence.
- Oh, all right, here.
- Thank you.
It's gone.
Well, naturally, sir.
You holed it.
Oh, well, isn't there another?
One moment, sir.
Your ball, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
- Saxpence.
- Saxpence?
- Saxpence.
I don't believe this.
Right, forget the golf.
We'll unpack and dress for dinner.
Very good, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I'll see you in the dining room, then.
Waiting for the other guests, are we?
Other guests?
There are no other guests, sir.
Hello?
Hello?
Jangs, sir, that's fearfully good.
I never saw your beak move.
That's because I didn't say anything.
Oh, away with you, sir.
Anybody at home there is, ja?
Accents, too!
Jangs, your master's fearfully talented, Mr. Igor.
Hello?
It's Dr. Von Goosewing, Nanny.
Ah, so, this the Ruritania Guest House is, ja?
Och, ye're no crummit wi' the slackbarra... ye doonhaggled wee...
No, no.
It's the Glen Sparrows Hotel.
Und where that would be, ja?
Not too far from Glen Sparrows.
Ach!
I told Heinrich that compass was no good.
What's wrong with the compass?
Pointing north it is all the time.
Yes?
Well, going south we were.
Oh, yes.
Why didn't I think of that?
Can I be of any assistance?
A first class room I had booked... und another fifth class for Heinrich here.
I see.
So you need one room for you... and one for Mr. Here?
- And one for Heinrich.
- Three rooms?
- Nein!
- Nine rooms?
- Two rooms!
- Who's sharing?
Who's caring?
It's happening again.
Should we start again?
No, no, anything but that.
Excuse me.
What?
Oh, yes.
I'm most fearfully sorry to bother you... but am I right for the Tower of London?
Hey, fancy dress.
Fancy that.
Of this a photo I must have.
The Tower of London's 400 miles away.
Tut!
I knew I should never have listened to Shakespeare.
Good job I know a shortcut.
Oh, yes.
Well, good-bye, then.
Good day.
Good day.
Are you all right?
Apart from a bump on my head, I seem to have lost my touch.
Great Scot!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You seem to have lost your head.
Will somebody show the old fool where the door is?
He's always doing that.
- This way, sir.
- Most kind.
Never used to bother with doors.
Can't understand it.
Fearfully kind.
Oh, dear!
Whatever will Cromwell think?
Hohenzollern Sigmaringen!
Something funny here is going on.
Well, not very funny.
On the picture nothing out is coming.
Nothing out is coming?
Yeah, I noticed that, too.
Oh, well, that's because...
Ja, because he a wampire was!
Wampire was?
No!
No, it's because...
Ja, ja, ja, I show you.
I show you another picture of mine host I am taking.
- Yes, but...
- Now you will see... that this time we are having a photograph of mine host.
I know, but you haven't...
Oh, great, I'd love a wee photo of meself.
- Yes, but, you see...
- Und here it comes.
- Blank!
- Oh, jangs, no!
So, you are a wampire, too!
Oh, well, everybody knows that.
Don't humor him.
He's serious.
Ja!
Und now you will perish.
Heinrich, bring the wampire blaster, quick!
Heinrich?
Heinrich!
Oh, betratten dang verboten.
Never around when I want him.
Now... you stay where you are, you willain.
- Oh, aye, I'm willin'.
- See?
Condemned from his own beak.
Heinrich!
Heinrich!
- You know, I like that wee fellow.
- You like him?
Aye, he's the only one who's ever believed I'm a vampire.
Oh, yes.
Oh, good shot, milord.
Where did it go, Igor?
It seemed, sir, to be on the green.
Come to that, where's Nanny?
She's supposed to be the caddy, but she's never...
Yoo-hoo!
Nanny, what are you doing over there?
- That was a close one.
- Close one, Nanny?
Your ball nearly fell down a hole.
Nanny, what are you trying to say?
That hole on the smooth bit.
You... you mean to... when the... if I...
Yes, but I seen the danger flag, you see... and I just saved it.
You wants to be more careful.
They don't grow on trees, you know.
Nanny!
I could have got an albatross!
Oh?
Who's Albert Ross?
Albatross!
Eagle, birdie, you silly old hen.
Oh, now that's naughty talk.
I get your ball for you, I carry your bag.
Drop it, Nanny.
Drop it.
Oh, well, if you say so, Mr. Igor.
Not the bag, you half-wit.
The subject.
- And the ball.
- Very good, Master Duckula.
- Nanny!
- Well, I'm only...
All right, all right.
I'll play the shot from here.
Yeah.
Give me an iron, Nanny.
Thank you...
No, Nanny.
No, Nanny.
No, no, no!
Ooh, we are in a mood today.
I want a club, a golf club.
I want to chip to the green.
I just hope I don't get a slice.
Now, let's see.
Give me a five iron, Nanny.
Fore!
Is this a five iron, Nanny?
No, of course it's not.
It's a four.
- Well, I want a five!
- Give that here.
Oh, you have got it on you today.
Fore!
You won't play at all if you goes on like this.
Nanny, give me the club.
Not till you say you're sorry.
- Give me the club!
- Sir?
Sir, I'll deal with her.
Nanny, the club.
- Well?
- Let me have it.
Are you sure?
Yes, Nanny, I'm sure.
I'm not gonna look.
I'm not gonna look.
Oh, dear.
Look at Mr. Igor.
He's dropped off.
So, with the antlers und the bagpipes...
I have a wampire blaster for myself constructed.
Now, I fill the bag of the pipes... with the essence von garlic.
So... and take the side along the antler... und fire!
So... nothing.
Why is this...
So, it works!
Good job I ain't no wampire... or quite giddy it might have made me.
Now the wicious wampire is...
Is your wee friend any better?
I think he's coming round.
Milord.
It's all right, Igor.
Stay where you are.
Where's Nanny?
She isn't here, is she?
You won't let her hit me, will you?
Now, now, Igor, it's all right.
The lady's outside in the grounds, Mr. Igor... practicing for the Highland Games.
Great Scot!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, no!
No!
Now, Igor, don't worry.
She can't hurt you here.
Hang on, I'll get you another aspirin.
I don't think I'd bother if I were you.
He seems to have nodded off again.
So he has.
Best thing for...
- What was that?
- Oh, not him again.
I say...
I say...
Try the door, you great gowk.
I don't seem to be able...
Can't you get in, my dear?
- Nanny?
- No, I don't seem...
Never mind, my dear.
You just follow me.
I could do that when I was younger.
I don't remember all the dust, though.
Oh, hello, Master Duckula.
You haven't seen a bit of a stick, have you?
Yes, Nanny, I have.
Poor old Igor tried to head the blessed thing.
Oh, silly thing.
- He might have hurt himself.
- Nanny...
First he wants me to hit him with a golf club... and now he's nodding the caber.
He must be going soft in the head.
Well, I'll get back to my practice.
I think I'm getting the hang of it now.
Aye, well, close the wall behind you when you go out.
Silly.
Excuse me, but am I right for the Tower of Lond...
Don't I know your face?
Well, of course you know my face.
You asked me the same question about twelve pages ago.
Oh, dear.
No wonder I thought the landscape was familiar.
You've been going around in circles.
Yes.
I move in aristocratic circles.
Oh, I see what you mean.
You mean, I've been going round in...
- Circles.
- That's the word.
Well, better be getting along.
It's all right.
I'll show myself out.
Tut!
I do wish I'd look where you were going.
Igor.
Igor!
Are you all right?
Would you like another aspirin?
No.
The last one seems to have made my headache worse.
All I need is a little peace and...
Oh, no.
So, you snake in the grass.
- Who, me?
- You!
- I'm a duck, sonny.
- What?
Oh, you're so literal.
OK.
- So, you duck in the grass.
- Heather.
I thought your name was Rory, Heather.
No, it's Rory McDuckula, Von Goosewing.
Hey, what a coincidence.
My name is Von Goosewing, too.
I think I knew your father...
Von Goosewing the First.
It's happening again.
It's happening again.
What I mean is that I'm no in the grass.
I'm in the heather.
Oh, ja.
Stupid old me.
I start again.
OK, you duck in the heather... your reign of terror is at an end!
What's that you've got there?
This is mine supplementary hand-made blaster... und with it, you I am going to blast.
Quick, Rory, quick!
Bite his neck.
Oh, no, he's the wrong collar size.
- Rory?
!
- Too late!
Loaded with garlic is mine wampire blaster... und to let you have it I am going!
Rory?
Vampire?
Igor!
This isn't the Glen Sparrows Hotel.
Come on, let's get out of here.
To the trailer.
Oh, do stay, sir.
I'm sure...
- Igor.
- Oh, very well, sir.
I do apologize, Mr. Rory, sir.
We seem...
Come on, Igor.
We're going.
Going?
But ye have nae paid the bill.
What's happening?
You are not going to London by any chance?
Hey, quick, after them!
We'll take that balloon of yours.
We must catch Count Duckula.
He's no paid his bill.
Count Duckula?
!
Yes, indeed we must.
This way.
Do you mind if I come along, too?
Faster, Igor!
Faster!
Slow down, Master Duckula!
I'm trying to make us a nice cup of tea.
There they are.
They think they can stay with Rory McDuckula for free, do they?
Faster, Igor!
Faster!
He's after my neck!
I'm afraid going faster is the least of our problems, sir.
It's slowing down that may be difficult.
Why?
What do you mean?
The brakes have failed, milord.
Oh, no!
They're getting away.
They're getting away.
Descend.
Descend!
This is a balloon, not a jet plane.
Do you mind putting me off at the next junction?
Look, Igor, there's a lake at the bottom of this hill.
Oh, that'll be the famous Loch Ness, milord.
You were anxious to visit it, I believe.
But not drown in it, Igor!
Igor, do something!
That's more like it.
I feel sick.
Well, put your head between your knees.
Right.
You owe me four pounds, ten shillings and saxpence.
And you owe me four pounds, ten shillings and sixpence... for hire of balloon.
And what about all my equipment ruined?
And I think we've got another puncture.
Nanny, go and make us a cup of tea.
Oh, look, I've seen one...
a vampire duck.
Don't be silly.
It's a fragment of your imagination.
Good night out there, whatever you are.
If you're feeling...
Or you're kind of...
Could be you've met up with
Duckula
If your knees go...
And your teeth go...
Maybe you've bumped into
Duckula
He flies through the night
Looking for a bite
But he's back home by daylight
Duckula
If you're sort of...
Or you're a little...
It's certain you've run into
Duckula
If your heart goes...
Or your mind goes...
Man, you had a brush with
Duckula
So watch out for the...
Beware of the...
And pray you'll never meet with
Duckula
Count Duckula

A film by Kiju YOSHIDA
Holy man...
I remember you very well.
You were only a child when you left for the capital
to study the biwa lute under a lesser master.
Yes, a very little boy!
Today I have come to thank the master for his generosity.
But alas, you tell me now that he has departed from this world!
It was so long ago...
Now, this House of the West
has been abandoned by everyone.
And what has become of the master's bride?
Well?
Has she also...?
Yes.
Lady Kinu is dead.
It was so long ago.
I see it!
The Valley of the Dead.
I know a cemetery there.
Could you take me there?
There is a grave where I would like to offer prayers.
Which one?
This tomb has already been plundered!
Thieves!
Imagine coming to sac a cemetery!
Such sad times!
Who is named as the deceased?
"Kinu".
It reads "Kinu".
That is the grave I am seeking.
May her soul rest in peace.
Hey!
Why are you opening the coffin?
Wretch!
Stop!
The divine curse will fall upon you!
Silence, monkey!
You have breached this coffin.
You must die!
What happened?
He is dead!
The peddler has been slain!
If you value your lives, begone!
What did you kill him for?
Tell me.
Why?
The violation of a grave is sacrilege.
I am Onimaru, Lord of the Yamabe, he who cuts down the guilty.
Leave, before my wrath falls upon you!
Buddha have mercy on us!
Here we are, the House of the East.
The Yamabe live here, obliged to serve the Mountain of Fire.
Keep your eyes open wide.
Father, I am happy to see you again.
My little Kinu.
How big you have grown during my absence!
You have the gift you promised me?
Of course, my child.
Ichi!
Bring the chest.
So this is what you wanted,
take it.
Scoundrel!
Your place is not here!
Get out, go on!
Among the servants!
Enough!
That's enough!
My Lord, where has this child come from?
I do not know, I found him.
- Where was that?
- In the capital.
I found him dying of hunger at Gojo bridge.
It seems to me that he resembles a...
A demon, you want to say?
That's a good idea.
We will call him Onimaru, the Demoniac.
Hidemaru, Kinu, listen to me.
From this time forward, this Onimaru shall be a member of our family.
You should be kind to him.
Kinu.
Stop.
Look.
It looks like a black devil!
Pay no attention to him, I tell you.
But father told us to be kind to him.
Even so, he is only a servant.
Come!
Brother!
We must be more severe.
I am going to punish him myself.
No!
Wait!
Do you intend to kill him?
This impure being has dared to meddle with the holy offerings, he has despoiled the spirits of the Mountain!
Brother!
You'll have to kill me next!
She's passed out.
Come along.
This insolent has profaned the holy rites of the Yamabe.
You must punish him.
He's but a peasant.
No more, I told you!
Banish him from here!
Or else divine wrath will...
That's enough!
It was precisely for his boldness that I brought him from the capital.
Despite the respect I owe you, I cannot accept this.
In this decadent age, who believes in the Gods' anger?
You mean to say... that he is more worthy than I to be a Yamabe?
Quite!
Father!
Very well.
I will leave.
Farewell!
But my lord, Hidemaru is your sole heir!
My Lord!
By the way, where is Kinu?
Last night, she fell ill.
Is she resting?
Yes.
In the women's shed.
Why is that?
After falling ill last night, she had her first period...
So my little Kinu is a woman now.
Who is it?
It is your breakfast.
Leave it for me here!
Why have I been shut up?
I don't want to stay here!
Listen to me.
During their periods and childbirth, women are sequestered here
Such is the law among the Yamabe.
It is in this place that your mother brought you into the world.
Look around you.
You see the rope hanging from the beam?
Your mother clung to it as you were being born.
Note it well.
What is wrong?
I am hungry!
Is there anything to eat?
No.
But yes!
Look, Onimaru, over there!
Scram!
We have no money.
Money?
Is that all?
All right.
Wait for me here.
Onimaru!
Outlaws!
Outlaws!
Yamabe!
Of the Mountain?
Why have you come down to the village?
The law forbids it!
Come, everyone!
Listen up!
We will be cursed by the God of Fire!
It is a Yamabe girl.
Serpent's blood flows in her veins!
The harvest will fall short this year!
Not a drop of rain the entire summer!
To whom have we made our offerings?
Death?
Stone them!
Run for it!
Kinu!
Onimaru!
This is in this room where wrongdoers are held.
Your father has commanded that you stay here until tomorrow morning.
Onimaru!
Father?
Kinu...
After your next period, you must leave for the capital.
You know the fate of Yamabe women.
When they've reached adulthood, they must leave the sacred Mountain.
According to our customs, they must leave for the capital
and serve as priestesses at the Kamo sanctuary.
But I do not want to leave this House.
I know.
I do not want to become a priestess.
I would tell you to leave earlier, but I do not have the heart.
So you must leave us...
I do not want to be a priestess.
I want to live as a true woman.
You must accept your fate.
How I regret... being born a woman!
What a strange smell!
Are you eating quail?
It is forbidden to kill those animals.
Eat.
It's good!
The Lord has told me that you are leaving for the capital.
And what will you do then?
I will go with you.
If it were possible,
I would have fewer worries.
The capital is dangerous, there is fighting everywhere.
You are not going alone.
And my father?
Who will look after him?
Then you accept that we should be separated?
I did not say that.
Fate requires that Yamabe women must become priestess.
But...
There is a way to stay on the Mountain.
A way?
What is it?
Another branch of our family lives on this Mountain, in the House of the West.
Yes, but our two families hate one another.
There is a young heir there who is named Mitsuhiko.
I am told that he has not yet taken a wife.
If I were to marry him,
I would leave this House, but I would remain on the Mountain.
We both live on the sacred Mountain, and it is here that, one day, we shall die.
Nonetheless, we see one another now for the first time.
How strange.
Since our most tender youth, we were told that our families were mortal enemies.
My departed mother took pity on my fate.
It is she who has led me to you.
Out of pity for your fate?
I went to pray at her grave, since I must leave for the capital.
I walked through the Valley of the Dead to say goodbye to her.
The way you say this implies you should never return.
Indeed, I was going to the capital to serve in a sanctuary.
You will be a priestess?
Yes, that is the fate of Yamabe women.
There is no custom so cruel as that in our House of the West.
You mean to tell me that women among you are not required to renounce the world?
Though born of the same family, we are like shadows and light.
I meant to say... that in the East you are obliged to appease the anger of the Serpent God?
It is an annual rite that we perform before transplanting the rice
to obtain a good harvest.
Our rite is different, since we imprison the divine Serpent in the Mountain of Fire.
Just so.
While we belong to the same family, we are sworn enemies.
No, that's only a legend invented by those who fear the Mountain of Fire.
But the House of the East is cursed.
Each year, its men turn into serpents, and its women leave this land to become priestesses.
Kinu, don't be so sad.
You may stay here on our Mountain.
You are saying that I might avoid
going to the capital?
Once, our great-grandfather and your great-grandmother were married.
The villagers feared the vengeance of the Gods, but to the joy of all, the harvests were good.
So, brother... you are asking her to marry you?
I don't see any inconvenience in it.
And you, Kinu?
Your marriage to the man of the House of the West...
Will it be favorable or disfavorable?
Father...
Go ahead.
If this is what you desire, leave for the House of the West.
I am very happy.
Swear before the Gods that if one day you have a son, he will be the heir of the House of the East.
Swear it.
If you do not have a son, Onimaru will become the heir.
It must never leave our family.
Master!
Master!
It is terrible!
Come, come quickly!
What is happening?
Some warriors are attempting to march over the Mountain!
Onimaru has just left by horse to stop them.
Ichi!
My horse!
Father, you are too old to fight!
Listen to me, Onimaru!
I will not let you go forth alone!
I am warning all of you!
Not one armed man shall cross the sacred Mountain.
If you violate this divine law, I must punish you, since I am the guardian of this holy place.
You will be cursed!
Lady Kinu, Onimaru is here to see you.
Tell him to come in.
As of tomorrow, you shall be the master of this House.
Osato, tell him to bathe himself, and give him something to wear
so that he shall truly have the presence of an heir of the Yamabe family.
Let's go.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Kinu!
Onimaru.
Where...
Where are you?
Here in the Forbidden Chamber.
Come in quickly, and close the door.
I remember so well being shut up in this room...
It was one night, after our misadventure in the village.
I...
I was being punished.
That smell... sickening and fetid,
worse than mold...
Onimaru, sit down in front of me.
You know why I have asked you to come.
Tomorrow, I will be departing for the House of the West.
I will never again return here.
You would really leave us?
I curse you!
Yes, curse me.
Your curse is the proof that you will never cease loving me.
Show me your body.
Your naked body.
I am naked, too, beneath this wedding kimono.
It is Lord Hidemaru.
He is back.
As soon as I learned of my father's death, I came back.
Is he already buried?
Yes, in the Valley of the Dead.
Let us gather there.
In spite of the quarrel that has divided us, he was my father.
Is that your son?
What a handsome little boy.
Oh, I have forgotten to alert Lady Kinu.
What's this?
A servant stepping beyond the threshold of this room?
Come on.
Come back!
Listen to me!
Servants must mind their places!
Lady Kinu...
Welcome.
I am very happy to see you again.
This is my sister Kinu.
My name is Shino.
My husband has told me much about you.
Good.
What is this?
Ichi, go see.
Onimaru is gone.
Why didn't you stop him?
You may never see him again.
You are mistaken.
He hasn't gone.
He is still here.
Here?
Yes.
Onimaru, it's me.
I am Onimaru...
He is in me...
One more push...
Hold tight!
A woman must bear this suffering.
He is born?
- Yes, but...
- But what?
Kinu?
Your little one is born.
It is magnificient.
Your child.
And Kinu, how is she?
Don't worry.
The child was ill, but everything is fine now.
Is it a boy or a girl?
It's a girl.
See how pretty she is... the dear little one.
It's...
It's the portrait of her mother.
Kinu has just recovered her senses.
She asks you to come to her bedside.
I thank you for your help.
If it is allowable, I will leave now.
I ought to return before nightfall.
But why not stay with us?
The route is dangerous.
Don't worry yourself, Ichi is escorting me.
We're lost and we're hungry...
Have mercy upon the disabled poor!
Such misfortune to be born blind!
Ignore them.
Wait!
They are a miserable people.
They should spend the night in our House.
Hold on.
These are no beggars, they are bandits!
Help me!
Shino!
It is his fault that the harvest is bad again this year.
The guardian of the holy Mountain!
Coming to procure the women here!
He's been cursed by the Serpent god!
We must kill him to appease the Gods' wrath!
Stop, we plead, stop!
You will all be damned if you kill him!
Let us do it!
We kill him, of else we will be cursed!
Wait!
Instead of serving the Gods, he is procuring women?
There have been far worse in these troubled times.
But this is madness!
A rapist of women, a dog, a beast!
Enough!
Do you not recognize your master?
It is Onimaru, Lord of the Yamabe.
He's come from the capital...
The Shogun have appointed him to govern this territory.
Suke, take this brat away, I wish to see no more of him.
That's an order!
Take him to the servants' quarters.
Listen to me, wretch.
I am the master here.
Be gone!
Shut it!
The sun is blinding me.
Close the screens.
From what I understand,
due to your valour, you have been made the master
of the two Houses of the sacred Mountain.
I cannot deny this.
What do you want from us?
Nothing in particular, you may remain in this House.
However...
Hold on!
I know what you have come to tell me.
You want to see Kinu?
I refuse.
Take our fortune.
Inherit this House.
But you will never see my wife.
Kinu refuses to see me herself?
No more!
The Lord is bidding us farewell.
Escort him with the honor he is due.
What are you laughing about?
I am thinking of the name you bear.
You are a devil, not only in name, but to the depths of your soul.
However, you do not scare me.
You do not frighten me, because I know
how much you love Kinu.
Jealousy devours you, which only shows
that you are a human being, and not a demon.
Stop!
I must share important news with you.
Kinu has been ill for a long time.
The birth of her daughter has left her so weakened that we no longer have much hope.
You are lying.
No disease could strike Kinu.
All the same, she herself seems resigned to her fate.
If she should die,
no one in this House will escape my wrath.
You will all die.
Kinu, your mother calls for you to come quickly so she may see you.
She wants to watch you play.
Stay there where she can see you.
You've left the windows open?
She seems a little better today.
Tell me,
Onimaru has come to visit, hasn't he?
He just left.
What did he want?
He has been named Lord of the lands of the sacred Mountain.
He distinguished himself in battle in the capital.
The Shogun has rewarded him with the honor of administering our two Houses.
In that case... this House belongs to him, too?
His intention is not to bother us now.
Beware,
watch out for yourself.
Onimaru is a terribly evil man.
His evil surpasses anything you can conceive.
I know too well... what he wants.
No.
You cannot imagine...
His cruelty is without limits.
He curses men,
he curses this world.
His imprecations will stalk us into death.
I know who he is.
I know his true nature.
Very well, I understand.
Kinu, you should go back to bed.
Your face is flushed... red with fever.
I am begging you.
Pay close attention.
You must understand.
Onimaru does not belong to this world.
I have not much longer here.
When I die, he will die also.
I will take him with me into the other world.
I promise you that I will drag him into hell.
I will prevent him... from doing evil to you.
Patience, a little patience yet.
I swear to you.
Together, we will go to hell.
Onimaru and me...
Kinu.
Calm yourself.
Kinu!
It shocks you to see me dressed in this wedding attire?
It is a gift from Kinu.
Where are you going this way?
To the House of the East.
Is that so?
Yes, I am going home.
To do what?
To become the wife of Lord Onimaru.
Really?
If you marry me, there will be no more discord between our two Houses.
I'm waiting.
Go inside quickly.
From now on, you will live here.
This is the Forbidden Chamber where the outcasts stay.
"Outcasts"?
Not they alone.
We also confine unruly women here and wrongdoers of the Yamabe family.
They all die here.
I thought that you wanted to marry me?
No need.
You belong to me like everything in the House of the West.
You will live here among the servants.
Consider yourself lucky.
Do you not hear the galloping horse?
He's coming!
It's Onimaru!
Kinu...
Oh!
Listen.
The sound of footsteps.
You're dreaming.
That's the wind blowing.
No.
Onimaru is here.
He is very near.
My love.
Don't worry.
I'll take him... with me... down there into the other world.
I will drag him... to the very bottom of hell's abyss.
So I will protect you.
Calm yourself.
It's a bad dream.
Yes, I hear his horse.
That is Onimaru.
He approaches, insanely happy, but... he does not know that death awaits him.
He can no longer escape from my curse.
Onimaru...
Die...
Die with me.
Bring the little one here.
Alas,
Kinu is no more.
You are sure of that?
Open your eyes.
Your mother is dying.
Isn't she beautiful?
Remember her face.
Never forget it.
He has lost his mind.
He loved her madly, but to open up her grave!
For having desecrated the Mountain, he will be swiftly chastened by the God of Fire.
We must forgive the dead one if even she comes to haunt the master!
Here it is!
The coffin!
We have unearthed it!
Stop!
Don't touch that.
Go away.
Out of my sight!
Scram!
Some sake!
Bring me some sake!
Hurry up!
Some sake, I told you!
What has happened?
He has seen Lady Kinu.
To violate a grave, such sacrilege!
You saw her in her coffin?
Lady Kinu...
Is she still beautiful?
Wouldn't you rather have a more lively woman?
This one's not dead.
Very well.
This night is yours.
Go into the Forbidden Chamber and undress.
No.
You're only a servant.
You must obey me.
Since you have not married me, you cannot touch me.
Get into that room, girl.
Take me in your arms.
Stop it!
I am not your slave!
Worms.
Thousands of worms grubbing beneath your flesh, in your entrails.
Filthy woman!
Stop, you are crazy!
Worms!
Your face disgusts me!
Take it!
No.
I'm begging you.
Weep!
Go on, cry!
No.
I won't let you rape me... it should be Kinu, the dead woman!
Shut up!
Don't pronounce her name again!
I'll strangle you!
The guardian of the Mountain languishing in debauchery!
He buys whores with the rice we give in tribute!
And if the God of Fire scatters over us cinders and lava?
It's too much!
In every way, our world is accursed!
The Yamabe have no right to enter our village.
Those who break the law must die!
Very well.
You want to know with whom you're meddling?
The Lord Onimaru has killed thousands of warriors in the capital.
But the law is the law.
Punish him!
To the death!
Go on, make your choice.
You want money?
That buys Gods and the Buddha.
Go on.
Choose, I'm telling you!
And there's more.
It's all very well to amuse himself with village whores.
But to open the grave...
Don't touch that coffin!
Suke...
We are going to the House of the West.
What is it?
You don't see anything?
Something is going on...
Where is your daughter?
Where is she hiding?
The place where the births...
Go search for her there.
I beg you, finish me off!
I won't survive anyway.
You will not die so easily.
The more you suffer, the better.
Let me die!
I don't want my daughter to see me this way!
Since you're less than a beast, I won't finish you off.
Such cruelty!
Father!
Father!
Stay away!
It's no use, he's dead!
Father!
It was you who killed him?
You are really scaring me...
Take precautions, Lady Kinu, when you get to the House of the East.
Although your mother gave birth to you there, it belongs to Lord Onimaru.
I know.
No.
I have cared for you since your birth, but Onimaru does not want me with you.
He refuses to allow me to stay with you.
Beware.
You have become a beautiful young girl and I am sure he is scheming.
Have no fear.
My cousin, Yoshimaru, also lives in that House.
I know he will protect me.
The courage you show by hiding your sorrow...
Reminds me of your mother.
This belonged to my mother, didn't it?
Stop!
You're blinding me.
In exchange, I offer you this sword.
It is the treasure our family.
It shall slay the Serpent god.
You are very much your mother's daughter!
You have come to kill me as one slays the Serpent!
Will you take this sword?
Indeed, I am an evil Serpent, an angry God.
But it won't be so easy to slay me.
Suke!
Come over here.
You will stay in your mother's room.
No.
I prefer the servants' quarters.
Why?
I am at your service.
This is why I have come.
What a plague.
Take her away!
This is her mother through and through.
I am sure of this, even if I cannot see her here.
She will not do, not for Lord Onimaru...
Mother... help me.
Mother...
Yoshimaru.
You are well, Yoshimaru?
I am Kinu, of the House of the West.
We are cousins, you know.
United by blood.
What are you doing here?
This is the women's quarters.
Men must not enter.
There is no servant here.
So I have tidied up and changed the bed-mats.
For you.
For me?
Wait!
Yoshimaru!
You're playing games with me!
Where have you taken her?
Answer me!
The corpse of my mother?
I have hidden it.
I do not want you molesting her each night.
She would never be at peace.
Be careful, I can make you suffer!
You can menace me.
You can hate me.
But I am the daughter of she whom you loved.
Hate me then, if you wish!
Insolence!
Would you like me to remove these garments so that you may take the body
that I received from my mother?
But don't forget... that through my veins, also flows the blood of he who you hate.
So tell me then do you love me...?
...or do you hate me?
Very well.
Since you insist, undress.
Like your mother, before, in the Forbidden Chamber.
You lie!
My mother would not...
She would not have done that.
It was before dawn the day she was to marry that man, your father.
We were lovers in this room.
It is not true.
My mother could not have been with another...
Undress.
No!
Yes!
Tell me that you want it, little slut!
So look.
Since you want it, look at my body.
Am I so like my mother, she who drove you crazy?
You may look, but I forbid you to touch me.
Yoshimaru!
Come and help!
Yoshimaru, help me!
It is very serious this time.
Yoshimaru, protect me!
He struck me like a servant!
Protect me, I am begging you.
Does this man intimidate you?
Look at these bruises.
He beat me to force me to obey him.
He wanted to rape me!
I know what you want.
Yoshimaru and I, you want us to kill each other, right?
Dog!
I will not kill you.
Not now.
But...
I will do it one day.
You dare to defy me, filthy servant!
Stop, I'm begging you!
Where is your mother?
Where have you hidden her?
Speak!
In the women's hut.
She's in there.
Yoshimaru!
Take it, this sacred sword which has slain the Serpent.
It will protect you.
You see, Yoshimaru!
You know the fate... of he who meddles with the holy offerings to the Serpent god?
Die, Onimaru!
I knew that this day would come.
But I am Lord Onimaru!
I won't let myself be killed this way!
Die!
Wait!
Don't kill me.
She calls for me.
Yes, Kinu calls for me.
Look!
Kinu is there.
She calls for me to come.
You don't see her?
I am so pleased that you have returned!
Why this strange gown?
If you had not returned,
I would have given myself to death.
It is all over.
I have slaughtered Onimaru.
He is dead?
He has lost an arm.
He won't survive it.
Why didn't you finish him off?
I took pity on him.
He suffered dreadfully calling for your mother.
He was no longer the terrible Onimaru at all.
You have freed me... freed me from his curse.
You have succeeded in slaying the Serpent?
Like in the legend.
My congratulations.
You would like to share our joy?
Thanks to you, I am relieved of my master.
The capital is mine!
Yoshimaru... let us go back to the House of the West.
You shall celebrate your wedding there!
Suke, ready my horse!
Wait!
We must remove the coffin from the Forbidden Chamber.
I cannot leave my mother here.
She must be returned to her grave.
Well...
There is no one?
They have left me here all alone...
Heartless men!
What is it?
Get a hold on him!
Come back!
Who is it?
There, look!
It is Onimaru.
He is not dead.
He's summoned my mother to come and be with him.
What a demonic man!

A film by Kiju YOSHlDA
Holy man...
I remember you very well:
You were only a child when you left for the capital
to study the biwa lute under a lesser master.
Yes, a very little boy!
:
Today I have come to thank the master for his generosity.
But alas, you tell me now that he has departed from this world!
It was so long ago..:
Now, this House of the West
has been abandoned by everyone.
And what has become of the master's bride?
.
Well?
.
Has she also...?
.
Yes.
Lady Kinu is dead.
It was so long ago.
I see it!
The Valley of the Dead:
I know a cemetery there.
Could you take me there?
.
There is a grave where I would like to offer prayers:
Which one?
.
This tomb has already been plundered!
Thieves!
Imagine coming to sac a cemetery!
Such sad times!
Who is named as the deceased?
.
"Kinu".
It reads "Kinu".
That is the grave I am seeking.
May her soul rest in peace.
Hey!
Why are you opening the coffin?
.
Wretch!
Stop!
The divine curse will fall upon you!
Silence, monkey!
You have breached this coffin.
You must die!
What happened?
.
He is dead!
The peddler has been slain!
If you value your lives, begone!
What did you kill him for?
.
Tell me.
Why?
.
The violation of a grave is sacrilege.
I am Onimaru, Lord of the Yamabe, he who cuts down the guilty.
Leave, before my wrath falls upon you!
Buddha have mercy on us!
Here we are, the House of the East:
The Yamabe live here, obliged to serve the Mountain of Fire.
Keep your eyes open wide.
Father, I am happy to see you again.
My little Kinu.
How big you have grown during my absence!
.
You have the gift you promised me?
.
Of course, my child.
Ichi!
Bring the chest.
So this is what you wanted,
take it:
Scoundrel!
Your place is not here!
Get out, go on!
Among the servants!
Enough!
That's enough!
My Lord, where has this child come from?
:
I do not know, I found him.
- Where was that?
.
-ln the capital.
I found him dying of hunger at Gojo bridge.
It seems to me that he resembles a...
A demon, you want to say?
.
That's a good idea.
We will call him Onimaru, the Demoniac.
Hidemaru, Kinu, listen to me:
From this time forward, this Onimaru shall be a member of our family:
You should be kind to him.
Kinu.
Stop.
Look.
It looks like a black devil!
Pay no attention to him, I tell you.
But father told us to be kind to him.
Even so, he is only a servant.
Come!
Brother!
We must be more severe.
I am going to punish him myself.
No!
.
Wait!
Do you intend to kill him?
.
This impure being has dared to meddle with the holy offerings, he has despoiled the spirits of the Mountain!
Brother!
You'll have to kill me next!
She's passed out.
Come along.
This insolent has profaned the holy rites of the Yamabe.
You must punish him.
He's but a peasant.
No more, I told you!
Banish him from here!
Or else divine wrath will:..
That's enough!
It was precisely for his boldness that I brought him from the capital.
Despite the respect I owe you, I cannot accept this.
In this decadent age, who believes in the Gods' anger?
.
You mean to say... that he is more worthy than I to be a Yamabe?
.
Quite!
Father!
Very well.
I will leave.
Farewell!
But my lord, Hidemaru is your sole heir!
My Lord!
By the way, where is Kinu?
.
Last night, she fell ill.
Is she resting?
.
Yes.
In the women's shed.
Why is that?
.
After falling ill last night, she had her first period.:.
So my little Kinu is a woman now.
Who is it?
.
It is your breakfast.
Leave it for me here!
Why have I been shut up?
:
I don't want to stay here!
Listen to me.
During their periods and childbirth, women are sequestered here
Such is the law among the Yamabe.
It is in this place that your mother brought you into the world.
Look around you.
You see the rope hanging from the beam?
.
Your mother clung to it as you were being born.
Note it well.
What is wrong?
:
I am hungrt!
Is there anything to eat?
.
No.
But yes!
Look, Onimaru, over there!
Scram!
We have no money:
Money?
.
Is that all?
.
All right.
Wait for me here.
Onimaru!
Outlaws!
Outlaws!
Yamabe!
Of the Mountain?
.
Why have you come down to the village?
:
The law forbids it!
Come, everyone!
Listen up!
We will be cursed by the God of Fire!
It is a Yamabe girl.
Serpent's blood flows in her veins!
The harvest will fall short this year!
Not a drop of rain the entire summer!
To whom have we made our offerings?
:
Death?
.
Stone them!
Run for it!
Kinu!
Onimaru!
This is in this room where wrongdoers are held.
Your father has commanded that you stay here until tomorrow morning.
Onimaru!
Father?
.
Kinu...
After your next period, you must leave for the capital.
You know the fate of Yamabe women.
When they've reached adulthood, they must leave the sacred Mountain.
According to our customs, they must leave for the capital
and serve as priestesses at the Kamo sanctuary.
But I do not want to leave this House.
I know.
I do not want to become a priestess.
I would tell you to leave earlier, but I do not have the heart.
So you must leave us:..
I do notwant to be a priestess.
I want to live as a true woman.
You must accept your fate:
How I regret... being born a woman!
What a strange smell!
Are you eating quail?
.
It is forbidden to kill those animals.
Eat.
It's good!
The Lord has told me that you are lea\ving for the capital.
And what will you do then?
.
I will go with you.
If it were possible,
I would have fewer worries.
The capital is dangerous, there is fighting everywhere:
You are not going alone.
And my father?
.
Who will look after him?
.
Then you accept that we should be separated?
.
I did not say that.
Fate requires that Yamabe women must become priestess.
But...
There is a way to stay on the Mountain.
A way?
.
What is it?
.
Another branch of our family
lives on this Mountain, in the House of the West.
Yes, but our two families hate one another:
There is a young heir there who is named Mitsuhiko.
I am told that he has not yet taken a wife.
If I were to marry him,
I would leave this House, but I would remain on the Mountain.
We both live on the sacred Mountain, and it is here that, one day, we shall die:
Nonetheless, we see one another now for the first time.
How strange.
Since our most tender youth, we were told that our families were mortal enemies.
My departed mother took pity on my fate.
It is she who has led me to you.
Out of pity for your fate?
.
I went to pray at her grave, since I must leave for the capital.
I walked through the Valley of the Dead to say goodbye to her.
The way you say this implies you should never return.
Indeed, I was going to the capital to serve in a sanctuary.
You will be a priestess?
.
Yes, that is the fate of Yamabe women.
There is no custom so cruel as that in our House of the West.
You mean to tell me that women among you are not required to renounce the world?
.
Though born of the same family, we are like shadows and light.
I meant to say..:
that in the East you are obliged to appease the anger of the Serpent God?
.
It is an annual rite that we perform before transplanting the rice
to obtain a good harvest.
Our rite is different, since we imprison the divine Serpent in the Mountain of Fire.
Just so.
While we belong to the same family, we are sworn enemies.
No, that's only a legend invented by those who fear the Mountain of Fire.
But the House of the East is cursed.
Each year, its men turn into serpents, and its women leave this land to become priestesses.
Kinu, don't be so sad.
You may stay here on our Mountain.
You are saying that I might avoid
going to the capital?
:
Once, our great-grandfather and your great-grandmother were married:
The villagers feared the vengeance of the Gods, but to the joy of all, the harvests were good.
So, brother... you are asking her to marry you?
.
I don't see any inconvenience in it:
And you, Kinu?
.
Your marriage to the man of the House of the West...
Will it be favorable or disfavorable?
.
Father...
Go ahead.
If this is what you desire,
leave for the House of the West.
I am very happy.
Swear before the Gods that if one day you have a son, he will be the heir of the House of the East.
Swear it.
If you do not have a son, Onimaru will become the heir.
It must never leave our family.
Master!
Master!
It is terrible!
Come, come quickly!
What is happening?
:
Some warriors are attempting to march over the Mountain!
Onimaru has just left by horse to stop them.
Ichi!
My horse!
Father, you are too old to fight!
Listen to me, Onimaru!
I will not let you go forth alone!
I am warning all of you!
Not one armed man shall cross the sacred Mountain.
If you violate this divine law, I must punish you, since I am the guardian of this holy place.
You will be cursed!
Lady Kinu, Onimaru is here to see you.
Tell him to come in.
As of tomorrow, you shall be the master of this House.
Osato, tell him to bathe himself, and give him something to wear
so that he shall truly have the presence of an heir of the Yamabe family.
Let's go:
Come on!
Hurry up.
Kinu!
Onimaru:
Where:..
Where are you?
.
Here.... ..: in the Forbidden Chamber.
Come in quickly, and close the door.
I remember so well being shut up in this room..:
It was one night, after our misadventure in the village.
I...
I was being punished.
That smell.:.
sickening and fetid,
worse than mold...
Onimaru, sit down in front of me.
You know why I have asked you to come:
Tomorrow, I will be departing for the House of the West.
I will never again return here.
You would really leave us?
.
I curse you!
Yes, curse me.
Your curse is the proof that you will never cease loving me.
Show me your body.
Your naked body.
I am naked, too, beneath this wedding kimono.
It is Lord Hidemaru.
He is back.
As soon as I learned of my father's death, I came back:
Is he already buried?
.
Yes, in the Valley of the Dead.
Let us gather there.
In spite of the quarrel that has divided us, he was myfather.
Is that your son?
.
What a handsome little boy.
Oh, I have forgotten to alert Lady Kinu.
What's this?
.
A servant stepping beyond the threshold of this room?
.
Come on:
Come back!
Listen to me!
Servants must mind their places!
Lady Kinu...
Welcome.
I am very happy to see you again.
This is my sister Kinu.
My name is Shino.
My husband has told me much about you:
Good.
What is this?
.
Ichi, go see.
Onimaru is gone.
Why didn't you stop him?
.
You may never see him again.
You are mistaken.
He hasn't gone.
He is still here.
Here?
Yes.
Onimaru, it's me:
I am Onimaru...
He is in me...
One more push:..
Hold tight!
A woman must bear this suffering.
He is born?
- Yes, but...
- But what?
.
Kinu?
.
Your little one is born:
It is magnificient.
Your child.
And Kinu, how is she?
.
Don't worry.
The child was ill, but everything is fine now.
Is it a boy or a girl?
.
It's a girl.
See how pretty she is:..
the dear little one.
It's...
It's the portrait of her mother.
Kinu has just recovered her senses.
She asks you to come to her bedside.
I thank you for your help.
If it is allowable, I will leave now:
I ought to return before nightfall.
But why not stay with us?
.
The route is dangerous.
Don't worry yourself, lchi is escorting me:
We're lost and we're hungrt...
Have mercy upon the disabled poor!
Such misfortune to be born blind!
Ignore them.
Wait!
They are a miserable people.
They should spend the night in our House.
Hold on.
These are no beggars, they are bandits!
Help me!
Shino!
It is his fault that the harvest is bad again this year.
The guardian of the holy Mountain!
Coming to procure the women here!
He's been cursed by the Serpent god!
We must kill him to appease the Gods' wrath!
Stop, we plead, stop!
You will all be damned if you kill him!
Let us do it!
We kill him, of else we will be cursed!
Wait!
Instead of serving the Gods, he is procuring women?
.
There have been far worse in these troubled times:
But this is madness!
A rapist of women, a dog, a beast!
Enough!
Do you not recognize your master?
.
It is Onimaru, Lord of the Yamabe.
He's come from the capital...
The Shogun have appointed him to govern this territory:
Suke, take this brat away, I wish to see no more of him.
That's an order!
Take him to the servants' quarters:
Listen to me, wretch.
I am the master here.
Be gone!
Shut it!
The sun is blinding me.
Close the screens.
From what I understand,
due to your valour, you have been made the master
of the two Houses of the sacred Mounta in.
I cannjot deny this.
What do you want from us?
.
Nothing in pa rticular,
you may remain in th is House.
However...
Hold on!
I know what you have come to tell me.
You want to see Ki nu?
:
I refuse.
T ake ou r fortune.
Inherit this House:
But you will never see my wife.
Kinu refuses to see me herself?
No more!
The Lord is biddi ng us fa rewell:
Escort him with the honor he is due.
What are you laugh ing a bout?
.
I am thinking of the name you bear.
You are a devi I, not only in na me, but to the depths of your soul.
However, you do not scare me:
You do not frighten me, because I know
how much you love Kinu.
Jealousy devou rs you, wh ich only shows
that you a re a human being, and not a demon.
Stop!
I must share important news with you.
Kin u has been ill for a long time.
The birth of her daughter has left her so weakened that we no longer have much hope.
You are lying:
No disease could strike Kinu.
Al I the same, she herself seems resigned to her fate.
If she should die,
no one i n this House will escape my wrath.
You will all die.
Kinu, your mother calls for you to come q uickly so she may see you.
She wants to watch you play.
Stay there where she can see you.
You've left the windows open?
.
She seems a little better today.
T ell me,
Onimaru has come to visit, hasn't he?
He just left.
What d id he want?
.
He has been named Lord of the la nds of the sacred Mou ntain.
He distingu ished hi mself in battle in the capital.
The Shogun has rewarded him with the honor of ad mi nistering our two Houses:
I n that case:..
this House belongs to him, too?
.
H is i ntention is not to bother us now.
Beware,
watch out for yourself.
Oni maru is a terribly evi I man.
H is evil su rpasses anything you ca n conceive.
I know too well... what he wants.
No.
You can not imagine...
His cruelty is without limits.
He curses men,
he cu rses this world:
H is i mprecations wil I stalk us i nto death.
I knjow who he is.
I know his true natu re.
Very well, I understa nd.
Kin u, you should go back to bed.
Your face is flushed... red with fever:
I am begg ing you.
Pay close attention.
You must u nderstand.
Onimaru does not belong to this world.
I have not much longer here.
When I die, he wil I die a lso.
I wi ll take hi m with me into the other world.
I promise you that I wil I drag h im into hel l.
I wil I prevent him... from doing evi I to you.
Patience, a I ittle patience yet:
I swear to you.
T ogether, we will go to hell.
Onimaru a nd me...
Kinu.
Calm yourself.
Ki nu!
It shocks you to see me dressed in this wedding atti re?
.
It is a gift from Kinu.
Where are you going this way?
:
To the House of the East.
Is that so?
Y es, I a m going home.
T o do what?
:
T o become the wife of Lord Onima ru.
Real ly?
.
If you marry me, there wil I be no more discord between our two Houses.
I 'm waiting.
Go inside quickly.
From now on, you will I ive here:
This is the Forbidden Chamber where the outcasts stay.
"Outcasts"?
.
Not they alone:
We a lso confi ne unruly women here and wrongdoers of the Y a mabe family.
They all die here.
I thoug ht that you wanted to marry me?
.
No need.
You belong to me like everything i n the House of the West:
You will live here among the serva nts.
Consider yourself lucky.
Do you not hea r the galloping horse?
.
He's com ing!
It's Onimaru!
Kinu...
Oh!
Listen.
The sou nd of footsteps.
You're d reaming.
That's the wi nd blowi ng.
No.
Onimaru is here.
He is very near.
My love.
Don't worry.
I'll take him... with me. :.
down there i nto the other world.
I wil I drag him. :.
to the very bottom of hel l's abyss.
So I will protect you.
Calm yourself.
It's a bad dream.
Y es, I hear his horse.
That is Oni maru.
He approaches, insanely happy, but:..
he does not know that death awaits him.
He can no longer escape from my curse:
Onima ru. :.
Die...
Die with me.
Bring the I ittle one here.
Alas,
Kin u is no more.
You are sure of that?
.
Open your eyes.
Your mother is dying.
Isn't she beautiful?
Remem ber her face.
Never forget it:
He has lost his mind.
He loved her madly, but to open up her grave!
For having desecrated the Mou ntain, he wi ll be swiftly chastened by the God of Fire.
We m ust forgive the dead one if even she comes to hau nt the master!
Here it is!
The coffin!
We have unearthed it!
Stop!
Don't touch that.
Go away:
Out of my sight!
Scram!
Some sake!
Bring me some sake!
Hurry up!
Some sake, I told you!
What has happened?
.
He has seen Lady Kinu.
T o violate a grave, such sacrilege!
You saw her in her coffin?
.
Lady Kinu...
Is she still beautiful?
Would n't you rather have a more lively woman?
.
This one's not dead.
Very well.
This night is yours.
Go into the Forbidden Cham ber and u ndress.
No.
You're only a servant.
You must obey me:
Since you have not married me, you cannot touch me.
Get into that room, girl.
T ake me in your arms.
Stop it!
I am not you r slave!
Worms.
Thousands of worms grubbing beneath your flesh, in your entrails.
F.ilthy woman!
Stop, you are crazy!
Worms!
You r face d isg usts me!
T ake it!
No.
I'm begging you.
Weep!
Go on, cry!
No.
I won't let you ra pe me.. :
it should be Kin u, the dead woma n!
Shut up!
Don't pronounce her name again!
I 'l I stra ngle you!
The guardian of the Mountai n la nguishi ng in debauchery!
He buys whores with the rice we give in tribute!
And if the God o'f Fire scatters over us cinders and lava?
.
It's too much!
I n every way, our world is accursed!
The Y amabe have no right to enter our vi I lage.
Those who break the law must die!
Very well.
You want to know with whom you're meddling?
.
The Lord Oni maru has killed thousands of wa rriors i n the ca pital.
But the law is the law:
Punish him!
T o the death!
Go on, make you r choice.
You wa nt money?
.
That buys Gods and the Buddha.
Go on.
Choose, I 'm tell ing you!
And there's more.
It's all very well to am use himself with village whores.
But to open the grave....
Don't touch that coffin!
Suke:..
We are going to the House of the West.
What is it?
.
You don't see a nythi ng?
:
Somethi ng is goi ng on:..
Where is you r daug hter?
.
Where is she hiding?
.
The place where the births.. :
Go search for her there:
I beg you, fi nish me off!
I won't survive anyway.
You will not die so easi ly:
The more you suffer, the better.
Let me die!
I don't wa nt my daughter to see me th is way!
Si nce you're less than a beast, I won't finish you off.
Such cruelty!
Father!
Father!
Stay away!
It's no use, he's dead!
Father!
It was you who killed him?
You a re real ly scaring me. :.
T ake preca utions, Lady Kinu, when you get to the House of the East.
Although your mother gave birth to you there, it belongs to Lord On imaru.
I know.
No.
I have cared for you since your bi rth, but Onimaru does not wa nt me with you.
He refuses to al low me to stay with you.
Beware.
You have become a beautiful young girl and I am sure he is schemi ng.
Have no fear.
My cousin, Yosh i maru, also lives in that House.
I know he wil I protect me.
The courage you show by hiding your sorrow...
Reminds me of your mother.
This belonged to my mother, didn't it?
.
Stop!
You're blindi ng me.
I n excha nge, I offer you this sword.
It is the treasu re our family.
It shall slay the Serpent god.
You are very much you r mother's daug hter!
You have come to kill me as one slays the Serpent!
W.ill you ta ke this sword?
.
Indeed, I am an evi I Serpent, a n angry God.
But it won't be so easy to slay me.
Suke!
Come over here.
You will stay in your mother's room.
No.
I prefer the servants' quarters.
Why?
.
I a m at your service.
This is why I have come:
What a plague.
T ake her away!
This is her mother throug h and through.
I am sure of this, even if I cannot see her here.
She will not do, not for Lord Onimaru...
Mother... help me.
Mother...
Yoshi maru.
You are well, Y oshima ru?
:
I am Kinu, of the House of the West.
We are cousins, you know.
U n ited by blood.
What are you doing here?
.
This is the women's q uarters.
Men must not enter.
There is no servant here:
So I have tid led up a nd changed the bed-mats:
For you.
For me?
.
Wait!
Y oshi maru!
You're playing ga mes with me!
Where have you taken her?
.
Answer me!
The corpse of my mother?
.
I have hidden it.
I do not wa nt you molesting her each night.
She would never be at peace.
Be careful, I can make you suffer!
You can menace me.
You can hate me.
But I am the daug hter of she whom you loved:
Hate me then, if you wish!
I nsolence!
Wou ld you like me to remove these garments so that you may ta ke the body
that I received from my mother?
.
But don't forget:..
that th rough my veins, also flows the blood of he who you hate:
So tel I me then do you love me...?
.
... or do you hate me?
.
Very well.
Since you insist, u ndress.
Like your mother, before, in the Forbidden Chamber.
You I ie!
My mother would not...
She would not have done that.
It was before dawn the day she was to marry that ma n, your father.
We were lovers in this room:
It is not true.
My mother cou ld not have been with another...
Undress.
No!
Y es!
T ell me that you want it,
little slut!
So look.
Since you want it, look at my body.
Am I so like my mother, she who drove you crazy?
.
You may look, but I forbid you to touch me.
Y oshi maru!
Come and help!
Y oshima ru, help me!
It is very serious this time.
Y oshima ru, protect me!
He struck me like a servant!
Protect me, I am beggi ng you.
Does this man intimidate you?
.
Look at these bruiuses.
He beat me to force me to obey him:
He wanted to rape me!
I know what you want.
Y oshi maru a nd l, you want us to kill each other, right?
:
Dog!
I will not ki ll you.
Not now.
But...
I will do it one day.
You dare to defy me, filthy serva nt!
Stop, I'm beggi ng you!
Where is your mother?
.
Where have you hidden her?
.
Spea k!
I n the women's hut.
She's in there.
Yoshi maru!
T ake it, this sacred sword wh ich has slain the Serpent.
It will protect you.
You see, Y oshima ru!
You know the fate... of he who meddles with the holy offerings to the Serpent god?
.
Die, Onima ru!
I knew that this day wou ld come.
But I am Lord Onimaru!
I won't let myself be killed this way!
Die!
Wait!
Don't kill me.
She calls for me.
Y es, Kinu ca I Is for me.
Look!
Ki nu is there:
She calls for me to come.
You don't see her?
.
I am so pleased that you have returned!
Why this stra nge gown?
.
If you had not returned,
I would have given myself to death:
It is a ll over:
I have slaughtered On imaru.
He is dead?
.
He has lost an arm.
He won't survive it.
Why didn't you fin ish him off?
.
I took pity on him.
He suffered dreadful ly calling for your mother.
He was no longer the terri ble Onimaru at al l.
You have freed me:..
freed me from his curse.
You have succeeded in slaying the Serpent?
.
Like in the legend.
My congratulations.
You wou ld I i ke to share our joy?
.
Thanks to you, I am relieved of my master.
The capital is mine!
Yoshimaru...
let us go back to the House of the West.
You sha I I celebrate you r wedding there!
Su ke, ready my horse!
Wait!
We m ust remove the coffin from the Forbidden Chamber:
I can not leave my mother here.
She must be retu rned to her grave.
WEel I. :.
There is no one?
.
They have left me here all alone:..
Heartless menj!
What is it?
.
Get a hold on hi m!
Come back!
Who is it?
.
There, look!
It is Onimaru:
He is not dead.
He's summoned my mother to come and be with h i m.
What a demonic man!

Horse.
Noun.
Plural, horses.
Definition 1.
A male horse, a stallion or gelding.
Definition 2.
Any large solid-hoofed...
Herb... herbi... herbo...
Aw!
Forget it!
Some anthropological-type guys claim that prehistoric horses had larynx muscles in their throats.
Recent findings suggest that this gene actually had been passed down for generations.
Some primitive cultures believed that the equine was created in God's image... noble, mighty, brilliant, sublime!
It was only after he finished perfecting his masterpiece known as horse that God turned his attention to the lesser animal.
Look at this guy.
Ha ha ha!
O.K., honey.
Come on.
I don't know why we have to keep hiding like this.
Honey, your wife's been dead for two days!
I know.
But the funeral.
The funeral doesn't start for a good hour.
Oh, son of a bitch!
For God's sake!
Buenos dias, señor.
I'm not here, Carlos.
Very sorry to hear about your wife.
Right, right.
Not now, for Christ's sake.
First it was your office, then it was the motel 8.
Why can't you take me by the ocean?
I can't wait till we get married.
I don't know if I remember how to make love in a bed anymore.
Walter.
Huh?
Walter.
That horse.
What about him?
I don't know.
It's like he knows something.
Louise, come on.
Walter!
Walter.
Walter!
What?
It's that horse!
What about him, for Christ's sake?
Can't we use blinders or something?
All right.
Not me, the horse.
Hmm.
Next week... dog meat.
Hi, Carlos.
Your stepfather no here.
He's in stall 47.
Aah!
Fred.
M-m-my mother just died!
Think this is easy for me?
Aah!
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Buy 10,000 shares of cromwell from Mrs. Bucktad.
But we just sold 10,000 shares to her.
We did?
Oh, right, the commission.
Every time we buy or sell a stock, we make a commission.
Just buy the stock.
The old bitch is made of money.
She won't even notice.
Have you seen the moron?
Fred?
No.
Tell him I want to see him.
Yes, sir.
Allison.
Aah!
Sorry.
Oh!
It was my fault.
It doesn't matter.
Are you doing o.K.?
Yeah.
Well, if there's anything that I can do...
Just let me know.
I'm telling you, Jack, we never officially changed ownership of the damned business!
I just found out she left her half to him!
Well, wha... yes, reverend.
Yes.
God bless you, too, sir.
Oh, Freddy, this man...
He makes it a little easier.
I'm sorry, Freddy.
Sit down.
You know, Fred, times like these I always felt people should be close to those they love.
Yeah, right.
Freddy, what do you think of me?
Um...
I...
I...
I don't want to be rude, but, uh, I think you're, like, the lowest scumbag on the face of the earth.
Mm-hmm.
But do you like me?
Oh, that's not important.
Let me just come right to the point.
I have a copy of your mother's will.
You may or may not know this.
We kept half of the brokerage in her name for tax reasons.
Because her death was so sudden, we didn't have time to change the darn thing.
She's left all her assets... that's one horse and, uh...
Half the brokerage... to you.
So that means half the firm is... is mine?
Well, legally, yes.
That's why I think you're going to be a very happy young man.
I'm prepared to buy you out at what I think is an excellent price.
What if I don't want to sell it?
Once again, you'd be stupid.
You take this offer.
Trust me on this.
There you go.
That's cash... mostly cash.
Hi, Fred.
Walter asked me to pack your things for you.
Every dog has his day, Sawyer.
Aah!
Aah!
O.K., so where's don?
Straight ahead.
I could probably, like, sell this thoroughbred for a lot of cash, right?
Señor chaney, this is don.
Is he sick?
No.
He always looks like that.
He's all yours.
Buenos noches.
Thanks.
That Sawyer, the guy ain't...
Ahh!
He's such a...
Dick.
Ha ha ha!
Yeah.
Fred, we've got to talk.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Jesus!
Don't scream like that.
Hello.
Listen, Sawyer!
I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work!
Fred, come over here.
Come on.
Come on.
Now, listen, Fred.
Now, Fred... aah!
...talk!
Aah!
Would you calm down?
Read my lips...
we've got to talk.
There's an old truck parked out back.
I left the keys...
Uh...
Under the visor.
Let's get out of here.
This place smells!
Oh, fresh air!
Now, where was I?
I speak human, giraffe, worm, toad, whale... humpback and sperm.
You might say
I'm a four-legged Dr. Doolittle.
So, don, do all horses speak English?
What, are you kidding?
Look, all horses can understand English, but only the chosen can speak it.
What about, like, Mr. ed?
Mr. ed!
That's what I think.
Every word was dubbed!
His lips were moving.
A stagehand was shoving a carrot up his butt!
Mr. Ed.
Pffft!
I guess you're curious about my childhood.
Not particularly.
Well, I was raised on a small farm.
Oh, I was restless.
Wild, I guess you could call it... like James Dean, except I slept standing up.
My old man and I never got along.
Finally, I just split.
A few weeks later I met gideon Cole.
Oh, he was a great blues singer.
He was a blind man.
You know, for a while, I had him convinced
I was a short, hairy Italian boy from the Bronx.
Terrible, I know, but it's true.
Hey, gideon, my hoofs are killing me.
What the hell?
God, that gideon!
He had a terrific sense of rhythm, but a shitty sense of balance.
He used to stand on the edge of the boxcar.
One day the train made a sudden stop, he went flying off.
I guess he's riding that great freight train in the sky...
Or spitting out dirt.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
After that, I met up with your real father, Dave.
We were two of a kind.

You know, we saw blue Hawaii 12 times.
When he died, and your mother married Sawyer,
I stayed in the stable.
I haven't spoken to anybody in a long time.
I'm glad you came along, Fred.
You're a talking horse.
You could make a fortune.
Sure, you just get up in front of people and talk.
Ha!
Go public, do the talk shows... letterman, donahue, Carson, Geraldo Rivera.
Oprah winfrey!
It's not that easy, Freddy boy.
I wish it was.
The talking world can put an unbelievable amount of pressure on an animal, especially when you're a horse.
For example, take my brother Lou...
Please.
Ha ha ha!
You'll like Lou.
You've got a lot in common.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh!

Are you stupid!
Hello, Lou.
Woo woo woooble woo!
Certainly.
Good to see you, too.
Where's mom and pop?
Look who's back.
Pop, this is my friend.
Is it male or female?
I can't tell when they have clothes on.
It's a guy, pop.
His name is Fred.
We're having' a party!
It's a pleasure meeting you, sir.
Hey, and this is my mom.
She doesn't talk, but she understands.
Ma, I can't ask him that!
She wants to know what it's like to face somebody during sex.
Well, um...
Since you're here, come in.
¶ Meow meow meow meow ¶
¶ meow meow meow meow... ¶ he never writes, he never calls, now he brings home a human!

Look what we ended up with...
James Dean and the fourth stooge.
You know when I think Lou started to crack?
When?
When he saw the godfather.
You know, that scene...
With the horse's head.
Yeah, that was his favorite actor.
Well, um, it was a pleasure meeting you, but, um...
It's getting kind of late, and I've got to head back into town.
Good luck with Lou.
Goodbye, don.
What?
Hey, Fred, wait up.
You think I was hard on him?
What are you going to do with your half of the business, Fred?
I guess I'll sell it to Sawyer.
Do you know anything about the stock market?
Not much.
I used to work at the brokerage, but Sawyer kept me in the mail room.
Said I didn't have the right image.
It was depressing, so I quit.
You know what would burn that bozo's butt good?
What?
If you ran with your half of the business.
I couldn't do that.
I've listened to those brokers.
They don't know anything you don't know.
It would be fun to see the look on Sawyer's face if I became his partner.
Maybe that's why your mom left it to you.
Give it a shot.
Good.
We'll talk on the way home.
Home?
I'll move in with you.
Uh-uh.
You can't live with me.
Why not?
'Cause you're a horse.
"'Cause I'm a horse," is that what you said?
I knew this would come up eventually.
You stay here with your family.
Take care of Lou.
Hey, you... you're all bigots!
With your automobiles, pants, and your postal systems!

Vernie, can I get back to you?
O.K., pal.
What do you mean, work?
Well, like, you know, you and me, we're partners.
I'm into this thing 50-50 with you.
That's going to be my office.
Right down the middle of the conference room, that'll be the dividing line.
So, if you need me, just, like, hoot.
You know, hoot!
Freddy, what are you talking about?
You want me to raise the buyout offer?
No.
All right, you win.
I'll double the price.
That's fair enough.
Deal?
I've got a lot of important business stuff to do.
Freddy, you can't be a broker.
Why not?
Who in their right mind would give you their money?
You'd be quite surprised.
I would be friggin' amazed.
I don't have time now.
If I need you, I'll call.
See you later, partner.

If we don't tell him microcorp's making a takeover bid for ventura in the next hour, we'll lose lots of money.
Whoever buys ventura is going to clean up.
Hmm!

O.K. Bye.

Buy ventur...
Denise!
Get in here right away!
Please!
We need to buy something called ventura.
Sorry, my pet.
Now, where were we?
What's he doing?
He just dumped a big wad into ventura.
Ventura?
What's it going for?
Yesterday, it was a robust 21/2.

Yes, sir.
Wait a minute.
That's the company Ted was supposed to call about a takeover bid.
Ugh!

I told them to leave the piano.
I didn't know how you felt, but I think it lends a certain je ne sais quoi.
Yeah!
Um...
Yeah!
I think you'll get a kick out of this.
What is it, a little yard?
It's an atrium.
Oh, an atrium.
Yeah, I had one of these in the last place I lived.

That's really tasteful.

No.

Oh, Fred, I'm coughing.
Listen.
I need a priest.
I'm getting a vet!
No!
No vets!
Fred, before I pass on,
I want to tell you how happy I am that you've made it and you're rich and that you live in a big, beautiful, roomy, palatial... you better come upstairs and eat something.
Gee, Fred,
I wouldn't want to impose on you.
No!
I insist.
Come on.
Boy, I really appreciate this, Fred.
I don't want to inconvenience you.
I don't want to be a burden.
By the way, can I have cable?
Whoa!
Padded elevator!
Fred, you've really made it.
Makes me happy to know that I've helped.
What do you mean you helped?
You remember, Fred.
That anonymous tip about the ventura takeover.
That was you?
Walter, buy ventura!
Buy ventura!
I owe all this to a horse?
Well, Fred, I wouldn't want you to feel obligated or anything, but, uh...
You know.
Come on.
Wow!
This place reminds me of the Vatican.
Shh!
Animals aren't allowed in here.
O.K., Fred.
My lips are sealed.
Mr. Chaney?
Hey!
Watch the tail!
Ahh!
Was that a horse?
No!
My friends and myself, um, we're on our way to a costume party.
Rather authentic costume.
Well, they're real sticklers for details.
Right, fellas?
Yes, Fred.
Yo, Fred.
Si, Fred.
Man, that was close!
I'll go get you a beverage.
Yeah.
Something diet, please.
Hey, Fred!
Nice digs you got here.
Very tasteful.
This will do just fine.
Only one thing is wrong.
What, outside of a horse being in here?
It just doesn't look lived in.
It feels like there should be plastic covers on the chairs or something.
I like it just the way it is.
O.K., Fred.
You're the boss.
Yeah.
I am the boss!
There's going to be a few rules.
Stay away from the windows and the doors!
If that jerk sees you, boom!
We're out of here!
Two... these rugs, you know, they're brand-new.
No problem!
No problem at all!
I just hope you read a lot of newspapers.
Yeah, I almost got married.
I was living with this hot-blooded Arabian.
You lived with somebody?
No way!
Oh, I loved it, and I hated it.
What did you love about it?
Everything.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
What did you hate?
Everything else.
So I wake up, I'm butt-naked!
Everybody's looking at me.
That was the last time I ever drank Tequila!
Ha ha ha!
I hear you!
No explosives!
We can't risk closing off the nest.
Can we use gas?
No.
It might poison the whole city!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Classic!
Classic!
Fred, are you asleep?
Uh-huh!
Thanks for everything, Fred.
You're my kind of people.
I like you, too, don.
Good night, Fred.
¶ Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm ¶ interests rates aren't going to go up any higher, so I'm staying out of the bond market.
What do you think?
You really want to know what I think?
I think you better get a bigger scooper.
Hey, wait a second.
Here's a good spot.
Mr. Chaney, please!
It's just a horse!
Yes, I know it's a horse!
But why?
Um, it's only for a couple days!
He's like a family member.
Which side?
Please, Mr. Chaney!
¶ Da da da ¶ excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
Oh, that's very good.
Oh, sorry.
Very good.
Very good.
Huh!
I don't want to go to school.
Hello.
Fred p.
Chaney.
Can I help you?
Sorry to bother you, but business week called.
They wanted to talk to you.
They wanted to talk to me?
Yeah.
They were offering 16 weeks for 12.98.
That's 25 cents off the newsstand price, so I grabbed it.
You called to tell me that?
No.
I called because we're invited to a party on the seventh floor.
When are you coming home?
I'm bored.
When I'm done with work.
Bye, don.
3rd floor... 4th floor... 5th floor... 6th floor... 7th floor...
Single man!
Aah!
Just the man I was looking for.
For what?
For what?
Oh, you're so funny!
Ha ha ha!
I'm so glad you're here.
I've seen you in the building.
Have some dip.
Do you like anchovies?
Mm!
Aah!
I love the eighties!
A woman can walk a man home, too.
Won't you invite me in?
No!
Will you hate me in the morning?
No.
I hate you right now!
May I come in?
Good night.
Thank you.
This is nice.
Look what you've done with this place.
Ooh!
What a neat statue!
This is beautiful!
And so lifelike!
Yeah.
It's like that even after I go swimming.
What?
What did you say?
I said, even after I go swimming, toots!
Aah!
Aah!
Was it something I said?
Aah!
You pig!
Say what?
Sorry.
Hmm.
Thank you.
You saved me tonight.
Come on, pal.
She wasn't so bad.
Yes, she was bad!
She reminds me of Catherine the great.
Fred, I got a hot tip for you.
Uh, coffee.
Coffee?
Mm-hmm!
Mm-hmm!
Mm-hmm!
Trust me.
What's he buying now?
Coffee.
Coffee?
Coffee hasn't done shit in 3 years.
How could he know about coffee?
The white zone is for Fred p.
Chaney only.
Where does he get his information?
He couldn't possibly find out himself.
Maybe you're underestimating him.
You're a clever girl, Allison.
Why don't you find out?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Allison wants to go out with you?
Yeah.
Can you blame her?
Who's picking up the check?
Would you please get over there?
She'll be up here any minute.
Look at my teeth.
I hate my teeth.
They're kind of bucked.
Your teeth look fine, but you should use a waterpic.
Hey, Fred, look.
Oo ho ho ho ho!
Yeah!
I'm Elvis.
Elvis?
Get over there, will you?
I don't understand why you asked her up here.
I want her to see the place.
Yeah, you got this place for her benefit.
What do you mean?
You're living here to impress people like her.
I like living here!
You make me sick the way you're laying it on for her.
You shouldn't have to act like George Hamilton III.
People should like you just the way you are.
Thank you, Elvis.
And another thing...
What's the deal with the ponytail?
It's like you're doing an impression of me.
How about picking up your dirty underwear?
And the toilet seat!
Why can't you remember to put it down?
Two of us live here now!
Hi, Fred.
Hi!
Mind if I come in?
Yeah!
I...
I mean no.
Please, come in.
Yeah, I mean no.
Oh, please come in.
That's an... that's an atrium.
Pretty, huh?
Kind of one of the selling points of the place.
It's... it's great!
So, you like it?
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
It's great.
It's just... you don't think it's too much?
Uh, I would love to see the kitchen.
Uh, you know, jeez!
Look what time it is!
We should head to the restaurant.
Ah-choo!
Uh-oh.
Woof!
Woof!
You have a dog?
Y-yeah, yeah, um...
I got to go powder my nose!
I'll be right back, o.K.?
Please?
I'll be out in a moment!
What are you doing?
Fred?
She's not buying the dog bit?
Woof!
Woof!
Whoops!
Fred?
I'll be out in a minute!
There's a horse in here!
Uh, where?
You know, if it's not cockroaches, it's palominos.
Fred, you're living with a horse.
Like, who doesn't?
Woof!
Woof!
Woof!
Woof!
Ha ha ha ha!
I'm sure he makes a great pet, but why don't you keep him in a stable?
Uh, I like having him around.
He's kind of like my good luck charm.
Fred, everybody at work is trying to figure out where you're getting these big stock tips from.
Don.
Don.
The horse?
Yeah.
He's, um...
He's a genius.
My lingwenis is very, very good!
It's Linguini.
Asalinguini?
Ling-ui-ni.
Tastes a lot like spaghetti.
Penthouse.
The horse talks just like us.
I believe you.
I used to have an invisible friend.
No, I'm serious.
You'll see.
Talk, goddamn it!
Please, don, say something.
Honestly, he really does talk.
Normally, I can't shut him up.
Hi, Allison.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Fred is always talking about you.
Thanks for dinner, Fred.
I had a good time.
Penthouse.
It was strange, but I had a good time.
Could we do it again sometime?
Ha ha ha!
Woof!
Woof!
Did you hear that?
Aah!
Gee, whoa!
Aah!
How was your date, Romeo?
Get any?
It was just fine!
Do you mind?
This is my favorite movie.
I don't recall you being in it.
I can't believe I told her you talked.
She probably thinks I'm insane.
I don't like her.
She's phony.
She's got a terrible nose job.
That's her original nose.
You should see yourself with her.
You're pathetic.
Do you know what you are?
You're jealous.
What?
Ha!
Don't make me laugh!
You're jealous!
I've never been jealous in my life!
Come on, Fred, let's not fight.
Let's drive to the country.
Night, don!
I wonder what mom's cooking for dinner.
That's pop.
Something's wrong!
I'll be right back.
Don, it's about time you got here.
I'm dying, son.
Don't talk like that, pop.
A horse knows when his time is near.
There are signs.
Your tongue darkens, your eyes water, your mind goes.
Your tongue darkens.
Your balls shrink.
Easy, pop.
Easy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I had an Uncle named Lou.
Soitainly.
Son, before I die...
You've got to promise me that you'll pass on your special gift...
Of speech...
To an heir.
Why me, pop?
What about Lou?
Yesterday, your mother caught Lou trying to mount a Volvo station wagon.
You're our only hope.
You don't understand.
I'm a loner, a rebel.
You're a bum!
Don, you're the last of the chosen.
We need an heir.
Son, quit screwing around.
It's time you met the right girl, settle down, become a father.
Oh, promise me, boy.
O.K., pop, o.K.
I promise.
I promise.
Well, there he is, boys, top money-winning 4-year-old on the west coast.
Next month he's in the El Segundo stakes.
He'll beat any plug they put up.
Is this place ripe, or what?
There's your partner's newest thoroughbred.
Yeah.
Wait here.
I got to go pay for your feed.
Check.
Must have cost a lot.
He did indeed, but he'll make it back... first with his legs of course, and then with his...
Walter!
Walter!
She's wonderful.
I love her.
Are you happy, honey?
Yes.
Then I'm happy.
That's my satin doll.
She's escorting the lord at the stakes.
Satin doll's a dressage horse
I bought for Victoria.
Hmm.
Hmm!
Va-va-va-voom!
Whoa!
Be still, my beating heart.
Je t'aime.
What a perfect form!
Ooh!
What legs!
What a tail!
Ooo!
What a saddle!
Check out the mane on that tomato!
Whoo!
Ya!
Na-na-na-na-nan!
Baby!
Take it nice and easy.
Just be cool.
Whatever you do, don't show her your teeth.
I hope you don't think
I'm coming on too strong for you, but what can I say?
That's the kind of guy I am.
Walter, what's that horse doing with my satin doll?
Freddy, get away from my horse, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Maybe I'll see you later, huh?
She was staring at my teeth!
Hello, is this the samurai florist shop?
Good.
I'd like to order flowers for a miss satin doll at the claremont Ridge riding club.
A lovely arrangement.
You wouldn't happen to have barley, would you?
How about some clover?
Huh?
Petunias?
I don't know.
I never tried any.
Roses are out of the question.
They'll get stuck in her teeth!
Hello?
Hello.
Oh, jeez!
Fred, I've fallen in love.
What am I going to do?
Be yourself.
If it's supposed to be, it'll be.
Did you read that on a bumper sticker?
Work.
Hey, where you going?
Aw, don't go.
Call in sick.
I don't want to be alone.
We can play charades!
Sorry, don.
I've got to go to work.
Nuts!
I was doing fine until she saw my teeth.
Delivery for a Mr. Don.
Delivery for Mr. Don.
Who?
No don here.
It says a Mr. Don at this address, and this is as far as I go, ma'am.
O.K.
Thank you.
Gracias.
Aah!
Whoa!
Is anybody out there?
I'm going to jump!
Hmm!
Fred, is that you?
Thank God you're home.
Just a second.
Just a second.
Hold onto your horses.
Ha ha ha.
Huh?
Hello, um, Denise?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
What did the index finish on?
Ha ha!
The guy looks like Willie Nelson.
That's hysterical!
What?
Oh, for crying out loud.
You can't come in here.
This isn't Noah's ark.
Hmm?
What?
No ducks!
That is in the lease!
No!
No!
No!
Oh, jeez, o.K.
But remember, this isn't technically my apartment.
I share it with a human.
¶ Yeah ¶
¶ kick it ¶ come on, I told you, there's no bones in there!
Jeez!
Hey!
¶ Time for school and you don't want to go ¶
¶ You ask your mama, please ¶
¶ but she still says no ¶
¶ you missed two classes and no homework ¶
¶ but your teacher... ¶
I don't think Fred's going to like this much.
¶ You've got to fight ¶

¶ Your pop caught you smoking, man ¶
¶ he says, no way ¶
¶ that hypocrite smokes two packs a day ¶
¶ man, livin' at home, it's such a drag ¶

Fred!
What are you doing here?
This is an unbelievable coincidence.
They were looking for another horse named don.
Get out!
¶ You've got to fight ¶
¶ for your right ¶
¶ to party ¶
¶ Party ¶
I can't believe you, don!
Look at this place!
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
Hello.
Information?
I'd like the number for the Los Angeles animal pound.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
I have never tasted anything like this.
You're eating?
I'm calling the pound for you!
Mmm!
I can't help it.
Mmm!
These oats are...
Incredible!
Must be something new.
Where did you get them?
I picked them up on the way home!
If I had any money, this is what I'd invest in.
Every animal is going to go crazy over this stuff.
This is better than Chinese food.
This won't leave you hungry, either.
Sorry, I have the wrong number!
Fred, grab a bowl and dig in before it's all gone.
I'm telling you... indio oats!
You won't regret it.
Yeah, indio oats.
Little company out of Bakersfield.
Uh-huh.
It's going to be bigger than...
G.E.!
Fred.
You want to go to lunch?
Can't, babe.
I got a big deal cooking on the burner.
Uh-huh.
No.
Forget g.E.!
It's a fad!
I want indio oats!
Uh-huh.
Buy indio oats!
Indio oats!
Buy it!
Hot!
Whoo!
What is it, Osborne?
He's selling everything and buying into indio oats.
What the hell is that?
I'm going to be in the little broker's room.
Hello, Mr. Chaney's office.
Hmm.
Curious.
71/2.
8.
81/2.
Holy shit.
Maybe we should buy some of this crap.
Can't.
Fred's cornered the market.
Maybe we can get it someplace else.
Yeah.
Hello?
Frank?
Boyd Osborne here.
Hey, Boyd-o babe!
There's a new company on the exchange called indio oats.
Oh, hey, you're not buying it, are you?
I just got inside information that the f.D.A. Is going to freeze all sales...
And launch a full investigation.
You're kidding?
Animals are dropping like bricks after eating the stuff.
What a shame!
Yeah.
Avoid that shit like the plague.
Thanks, Frank.
Owe you one.
Sigma chi.
Sigma chi.
Hubba, hubba, hubba!
Indio oats, indeed!
Testing.
Is this on?
Ladies and gentlemen of wall street, it is both an honor and a privilege to receive the award of stockbroker of the year.
I'd like to thank each one of you, but I don't have enough time, so thank you.
Ow!
I jammed his phone.
This is locked.
He'll never get out in time.
That's occupied, pomeroy.
Why don't you just use this one?
This one, sir?
¶ A wop bop a loo bop ¶
¶ a lam bam boom ¶
Mr. Chaney, you have an emergency call on 21.
Mr. Chaney, you have an emergency call on 21.
Hello.
Oats contaminated.
Took time to hit me.
What are you talking about?
Those indio oats.
They're poison!
Oh!
If I hadn't taken 6 pounds of maalox,
I'd be pushing up petunias in poughkeepsie, permanently.
That means indio oats...
They're worth squat.
This horrible face on the wall isn't helping.
This number is not working in this area code.
Don!
Don!
Hello!
Hello!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Aah!
Ah!
Aah!
Ah!
Aah!
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy... ohh!
Live by the sword, die by the sword.
Let's give him, oh, say, half an hour.
That should be the end of indio oats.
Ha ha ha!
Could I show you the murcheson figures?
Sure.
Help!
Help!
Aah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Get away from me, you diseased, winged, rotten bird!
Look at Freddy's oats.
How low can you go, indio oats?
Open the window!
Help!
Help!
Open the goddamn window!
Hi, Mr. Chaney.
What are you doing out there?
Open the window!
Come back in here.
You could hurt yourself.
I brought you a tuna fish sandwich.
Sandwiches?
Aah!
Which do you want...
rye or whole wheat?
Open the goddamn window!
What?
Open the window!
Rye or whole wheat?
Rye!
Rye!
Open up the window!
Really, Mr. Chaney!
Open the window!
Aah!
Freddy?
Problem?
Little financial trouble?
Maybe we should talk.
Soon.
Come on, Fred.
You haven't lost everything.
Hey, you still got me.
Stay on your side of the road!
We could hit the road together, like those guys, the, uh...
Swengi brothers.
I need some time alone, understand?
Ha ha ha!
Sure.
Sure.
No problem.
Fred, what do you think you'll need?
A couple minutes?
Good luck, Fred!
You'll always be my best friend!
Well, maybe not my absolute very best friend, but certainly in the top 10.
My 10th best friend.
15 would be the floor.
Big promotion.
New office, expense account, perks.
I found out the geek was sinking his money into this rinky-dink outfit that was about to go under.
Ha ha ha!
Me and Sawyer didn't tell him about it.
We locked him in the bathroom while his stock was crashing!
Yeah, well, that's business.
You little bastard.
Allison!
Oh, Allison, what do you care?
Well, here's to Freddy.
Good riddance.
Good riddance.
Son of a bitch.
You set him up.
Set who up?
You and this ass-kissing idiot.
What's she talking about?
I'm talking about Fred, about the way you sold him down the river.
Business is a tough world, Allison.
He's right.
You don't know how tough yet.
I quit.
Bad day at the office, dear?
The pits.
I can't believe I'm talking to a horse.
There's nobody else here.
I feel terrible about Fred.
Well, you should.
Well, I'm sorry.
Listen up, curly.
Fred's a nice guy, and he likes you a lot.
What are we going to do?
Help him restore his self-confidence.
How?
He didn't have much before.
If we hypothetically enter a horse in the El Segundo stakes and that horse wins, then Fred will get a shitload load of money, and Sawyer will not get a shitload of money.
You see?
Fred would get the shitload!
That's a great idea, don.
But where do we find a thoroughbred?
Ahem.
Here's the beauty of my plan.
You are looking at him.
Something funny?
Sorry.
If I can pull this off, you both get rich.
I get satin doll.
You get a piece, I get a piece.
Whoa!
Mm-mm!
Happy ending!
Don, I know you've got four legs, but... hey, I'll worry about the winning.
You worry about the driving.
And would you turn off this east Indian music?
Don, you can't win a race!
Why not?
Give me one reason.
Well, look at you.
Give me another.
Ah, forget it.
I know I can't outrun those other horses.
That's the way a horse race is normally won.
No, no, no!
Freddy, listen.
Horses have hang-ups, just like people.
Maybe I can psych them out.
Some are sensitive about their mothers.
Some have envy of... ahem...
you know what.
Others have no self-esteem, just like someone else we know.
Yeah, real funny.
It's very simple, Fred.
We'll invade their psyches, analyze their subconscious, we'll use Freud and jung, and we stick it to them where the moon don't shine!
Do you want a hamburger?
No.
Do you want a people burger?
Have you talked to Mickey about this?
I like it if they know this, if they've got it at least a week ahead.
Wait a minute.
Hmm.
Didn't I see that nag on the front end of a milk truck... was it last Thursday?
Last Friday.
Freddy, heard a stupid rumor you're entering a horse in the stakes.
It's not a rumor.
This the plug?
Yeah, this is the horse.
You're kidding?
What's his name?
Don.
Don.
Just don.
Sounds like a plumber.
He doesn't need any pretentious names.
His breeding, it's in his legs.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
I don't think you have a snowball's chance in hell of finishing on that piece of shit.
Lick my nose.
We'll win this race.
Want to make a little bet?
I got nothing to bet.
You can bet this turd.
I couldn't bet my tu... horse.
Chickenshit, huh?
O.K., I'll bet this horse against what?
What do you have to bet?
Well, let's see, um...
Can you break a 20?
I'll bet my horse against your horse.
Hey, now, that's ridiculous.
Chickenshit?
Who... who are you calling chickenshit?
You.
You're a chickenshit chickenshit.
O.K., Freddy, I'll make the bet.
My horse against your horse.
All my horses against your horse!
Sweetheart, you can't do that.
You think I'm chickenshit?
That's a bet.
Including satin doll.
Including satin doll.
No!
Not my satin doll!
Darling, don't be a chickenshit.
You're on, Freddy.
Is he getting more obnoxious?
Me and my big mouth.
What a revolting development this turned out to be.
Ah cha-cha-cha!
Let me tell you something, mister.
I been riding horses all my life.
I'm the man to ride this damn horse.
Why do you say that, Mr. um...
Mr. Snake.
One shot of this, he can win Indianapolis 500.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Eh!
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Marv?
Marv?
Marv!
Great, Fred.
He's perfect.
Let me do the rest of the interviews, all right?
What makes you the man to ride me...
I mean, to ride don.
Ha ha ha!
'Cause I know how to handle these animals.
Well, what do you mean, Mike?
Well...
You got to be...
Tough on 'em.
You got to let 'em know who's...
Boss.
Some people think horses are wonderful animals.
Let me tell you...
They're the dumbest shits.
God ever put on the face of this earth!
Hey, watch what you're saying, butthead.
What did you call me?
Nothing!
I called you a butthead, butthead.
What are you going to do, butthead?
Come on, wimp, take a swing.
I dare you.
Aah!
You got a really big mouth!
Are you trying to get me killed?
Who's next, Fred?
That's it.
No one's next.
That was the last available jockey.
What?
!
What are we going to do now?
I'll think of something.
Oh, no.
What am I going to do?
I'll never win this thing.
God help me.
Quit sniveling.
Everything will be fine.
Well, that's easy for...
is that you, lord?
No, you stupid son of a bitch.
It's me.
Dad, is that you?
Of course it's me.
So much for the glamour of reincarnation.
Dad, you're a horsefly.
Oh, I'm a horsefly!
Oh, I didn't notice!
That would explain the little wings, why I've been buzzing around piles of manure all day, and leaving little fly droppings wherever I go.
Thank you for solving that mystery, Sherlock.
Pop, I'm glad to see you.
I got a real problem.
I don't stand a chance of beating those horses.
Why not?
They're all professional athletes.
I've always been more of a couch potato.
You can do it.
You're a horse, just like they are.
You all have hoofs.
You all have legs.
Oh, sure, but their legs work!
Son, you have something they don't have... a big mouth.
You can win this race!
You really think so?
Absolutely.
You're absolutely right.
I can win this race.
Now, who's going to run this race?
I am!
Who's going to win it?
I am!
That's the spirit!
No offense, but what's it like being a horsefly?
It sucks.
We're just a short time away from the start of the 75th El Segundo stakes.
Lord Kensington is the 4-year-old champion, a favorite to win today's race.
In the next stall, the long shot, number 8.
This is don... don?
Bill, is that right?
Just...
Don?
Give me a break.
Just forget about him, o.K.?
Yeah, right.
Right.
It's normal to be nervous.
Who's nervous?
Breathe deeply.
In through the nose...
Out through the mouth.
In through the nose...
Ahem.
Whew!
Uhh!
He's got to be cheating.
Jack, you better use that whole can.
Uhh!
What's this, some kind of joke?
Uhh!
Riders up!
When you break through the gate, just try and stick to the rail.
O.K., um...
Stick to the rail.
You riding that yourself?
That's right.
That figures.
This ought to be good.
Well, old boy, by this time tomorrow, you ought to be dog meat.
Ha ha ha!
You look good, Fred.
Thanks.
Wait a minute!
This horse and me, we're going out there, and we're going to beat the odds.
'Cause I'm going to get you back for everything you ever did to me and my family.
Let me tell you something about the little guy.
You can only push him around until you back him in the corner.
Like the mighty Wolverine who gnaws his leg off if caught in a trap,
I'm going to start gnawing my leg off.
My name is no longer Fred p...
What is my name?
My name is.
Fred p.
Wolverine chaney, because justice is finally going to be done.
The little guy is finally going to whip your ass.
Aah!
The track's the other way.
I got it.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is your track announcer.
If he wins this race,
I'll syndicate him for millions.
...the 75th running of the El Segundo stakes.
Number 1 is heavy rains, from the long meadow farms, and ridden by ernestine esposito.
Number 2 is curiously, ridden by Dennis riday.
Let him take an early lead before you make your move.
Early lead?
Make my move?
We'll be lucky if we don't get lost.
Good luck, you guys.
Lord Kensington, from the Sawyer stable,
There he is!
God, he's beautiful.
Honey, Jesus!
...ridden by Shelly boyle.
Number 8, out of pepperidge farm, and ridden by Fred p.
Chaney, is...
Don?
Don?
Don?
Don?
Don?
The horses are at the post.
There you go.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy.
Ho, boy.
Whoa!
Lord Kensington is delaying the start.
Come on, where's your big plan?
I'm thinking.
Get off my back.
You know what I mean.
Number 7!
Number 7, over here!
Look into my eyes.
You look very tired to me, very sleepy...
At the sound of the bell, you'll turn into a mushroom.
You are drifting into a deep, deep sleep.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
The horses are in the gate.
Here we go.
Uhh!
The flag is up...
There they go!
Heavy rains breaks on top, followed by curiously, never too early, and lord Kensington, and trailing by four horses...
Don.
Ohhh!
Hey, look!
I'm running!
Pfft!
Aah!
Pfft!
How are we doing?
Are you blind?
We're losing, come on!
I got an idea.
How about we trade places and I ride you?
Hey, Pablo's pride, wait up!
Pablo's pride, the immigration people are here.
They're waiting at the finish line.
They're checking green cards.
Yeah. ¡immigracion!
¡Immigracion!
Greena carda!
Ha ha ha!
Greena carda!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
Yeahhhh!
Pablo's pride has slowed.
Now he's turning around.
Pfft!
Whoa!
I'm warning you, Fred, stop kicking me!
Hey, fellas, wait up!
Wait up, will you?
Move over.
Oh, boy!
What a beautiful day for a race, huh?
Whoo!
I'm telling you, you guys are doing terrific out here.
Did you hear the news?
The acme mucilage people are in the stands.
They're buying up all the winners.
Mucilage.
You know, glue.
This is easier than I thought.
Don't get cocky!
Hey, Lindbergh, quit flapping your wings or we're going to take off.
Come on, don!
Come on!
Around the clubhouse turn, lord Kensington is coming up fast on the inside.
He's making his move.
...heavy rains, he's taken the lead.
And narrowing the gap is...
Don.
I think I just ate some poop!
Whip his ass, Mickey.
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.
I thought I could, I thought I could,
I thought I could.
I thought I could.
I haven't run a mile since high school.
Ohh!
I'm dying here.
Yeah, me, too.
Hey, get that piece of shit out of my way.
What did you say?
You heard me... get that piece of shit out of my way.
That's not polite or even being a good sport.
When you say that I just wanna...
Rip your goddamn arm off and feed it to that stupid horse!
Now, get outta my way!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
That's tell him, Fred!
Curiously is veering to the outside.
He's pulling off!
Hey, heavy rains!
Wait up!
Here's a good one for you.
What do you get when you got 12 donkeys on your front lawn?
Fertilizer.
Ha ha ha ha!
Heavy rains is pulling up.
But wait a minute.
Here comes Pablo's pride in the wrong direction!
Come on, you pygmy son of a bitch.
He's going to do it!
Of course.
He's a champion.
Fred, I...
I can't make it.
Talk to me like that old guy in rocky.
Do it for the American way of life.
You can do better than that.
O.K. Do this for your mom and dad.
Yeah, right.
For my mom and dad.
I told you!
I don't believe it!
Turning for home is lord Kensington, but making up ground rapidly is don!
Don?
Don?
What's this?
Into the home stretch, it's lord Kensington.
But here comes don!
Woo woo woo woo!
Do it for hot dogs!
Do it for Mary Tyler Moore!
This sentimental stuff just ain't working for me.
Do it for satin doll!
Yeah!
Yeah, right!
Keep talking!
You win this thing,
I'll have your teeth capped.
Cosmetically bonded?
Like a TV anchorperson?
Yeah!
The whole 9 yards!
Now, come on!
Go!
Yee hah!
Ohhhh!
Yes!
Yes!
Come on, baby, go.
What do you get when you have 20 donkeys on your lawn?
He's going to do it!
Come on!
Move it, lord!
Where do you think you're going with that refugee from a glue factory?
Get that piece of road kill out of my way!
Hey, Kensington, you can't win this race.
And you know why?
Come on!
Come on, baby.
Huh?
Do you know why?
Yes!
You stupid animal!
Do you know why?
Come on, mama!
I'll tell you why.
Because, uh...
Because, uh...
Because, uh...
Do it!
Come on!
¶ Because of the wonderful things I've done ¶
¶ da doodley doodley doo ¶ woo woo woo woo woo!
Huh?
Huh?
Why, mother, I'm cured.
Knyuk knyuk.
Yes!
I told you!
Ladies and gentlemen, please hold all tickets.
We have a photo finish.
Let's get to the winner's circle.
We don't know if we won.
This is great!
What's this?
Those are the horse's front teeth.
What?
Give me that.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
The result of the 7th race of the El Segundo stakes has been declared official.
The winner, by an incisor, is don!
Ohh!
We won!
We won!
You lost the race!
You lost our horses!
You lost my satin doll!
Shut up!
Let me think!
I bet a hundred bucks on don.
I just won 20 grand.
Congratulations, Osborne.
You're fired.
Fred, over here!
Smile, please.
Smile.
How does it feel to win?
Couple more, Fred.
Freddy!
Freddy, boy!
Fred, son!
You did it!
Congratulations!
You're not going to hold me to that silly bet now, are you, pal?
Partner?
Son?
I think I am...
Dad!
Happy trails, Walter.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ohh!
What awful breath!
Must be the second worst smelling breath
I've ever had in this office.
Oh, that's good.
I have horse saliva all over my hands.
Just keep the tongue still for a second.
What do you think of this, Mr. Horse?
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Hey, thanks, doc!
Now I'm perfect!
Ha ha!
O.K. No problem at all.
If there's any irritation, rinse with salt water and put on a compress.
I don't thi... bee a ba Dee a ba Dee that's all folks!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

To Jacques Brel.
who will give a circus show for me nostalgic love in the dust who will make me go "I'm scared"
the knife in the heart, in the limelight who will treat me like a tigress the whip like a caress to the music who will make me balance between balloons full of pathos sometimes I panic
who will tell me words of love that can hurt who will hold me
ITINERARY OF A SPOILED CHILD when you'll release all the stars who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore
who will still make me dream the clown or the rider who emerges from the shadow who will still bring me the artist's performance the trapeze artist's show see him fall who will still bring me the child that plays
for the performing dogs or the vampires
Don't you have a ticket?
Where's your mother?
Where?
In the bar?
Wait, I'll check.
This boy says his mother's in the bar.
Could you have a look?
Ask for the mother of the boy.
Wait a moment.
What's your name?
Sam?
What have you got there?
Can I have a look?
Is that your mother's?
Sam's three years old.
I can't keep him.
I'm desperate.
Look after him.
I beg you.
three years later
Sam, 13 years old
Sam, 16 years old
it has a silver shine the itinerary of a spoiled child is littered with broken toys
the itinerary of a spoiled child
The last time I saw him, was just before he left.
He wanted to get to know himself.
This solitary voyage was a challenge he added to all the storms in his life.
He always said: when I spend some hours with you, I want to believe.
When I spend an evening with my children, I want to believe in family.
When I'm with a woman, I want to believe in love.
That's Sam Lion for you.
You know why he was called that, don't you?
He was found near a circus and when he was registered... the circus master called him Sam Lion because he was always near the lions.
This is the best day of my life.
-Because it's beautiful here.
Where does all this water go?
-To Lake Kariba.
It's beautiful.
Rainbows come straight out of the water.
The most beautiful spot in the world.
Will we see all of that?
You and I?
Look a rainbow.
Quick.
Make a wish.
When he falls from the trapeze, he becomes a street sweeper... so he can stay with the carnival.
He wins a prize for best sweeper and gets the award from Yvette... who becomes his wife.
They have a son, Jean-Philippe.
Then the big drama happens in Singapore.
He has to raise Jean-Philippe on his own.
It takes him ten years to recover and meet Corine.
Ten years to turn his little business into an international company.
Ten years before he can smile again upon seeing a child's face.
Magnificent.
You look more and more like your mother.
-Then you must be starting to hate me.
Whose idea was it to go here?
-Mine.
I wanted to go to Venice, but Corine had already been there.
Then I realised they have even more water here.
Who decided to call me Victoria?
-Your mother.
She's sure you were conceived here.
In this area.
I'm glad it wasn't near the Niagara Falls.
You were almost called Isabelle.
Because I loved Jacques Brels song.
It's about his daughter.
But because of this spectacle, you became Victoria.
How did you get the business?
After my accident, I was responsible for keeping the circus clean.
I looked for machines to do the work.
What shall we do tonight?
American dinner, tamtam, birthday cake, champagne.
The good life.
Doesn't that give you ideas?
-Why not?
I watched them this morning.
It's great what they do.
Look, he's the best one.
Unbelievable what he does.
Imagine, autumn on the Champs-Elysées.
'Ballet with Brooms'.
When will the machines be introduced?
-In a month.
How did you get the idea?
My daughter and I saw them on our travels and we improved on them.
They say a minister is interested in buying them.
That makes sense.
It's of interest to the public.
Are you really going to buy a circus that has gone bankrupt?
I love the circus, but that's nonsense.
I only hired people who were about to be fired.
This is my secretary, by the way.
The only secretary to land safely after a death-defying leap.
Most of the time.
How did you become the biggest in your trade, in 10 years?
Step in the shit often and always clean it up.
So this machine will replace street sweepers?
This machine can clean 10 kilometres per day.
A person can do 1 kilometre.
The operator can also use the machine as a mode of transport.
But most of all, the operator doesn't make contact with the garbage anymore.
The work will get a better reputation and will also be performed by students.
So, sweepers will be unemployed.
The machine can't reach everywhere and traditional sweepers are still required.
But they should learn to use roller-skates.
Do you find this funny?
-Not at all.
I need to talk to you.
-I understand.
What do you mean?
-I'm just saying I understand.
I don't want to go to the hotel.
It's not a hotel, it's where I live.
It's also about the rest.
What?
I don't have anything.
This machine's my first moped.
What do you want?
What do I have to do to keep you?
Drive a pink Cadillac?
Wait a moment.
Wait.
Here, this is for you.
What is it?
-Have a look.
I'd like to take you there.
Near Victoria Falls.
Are you going?
Alright.
Can I keep this?
-It's a present.
Will you be roller-skating for long?
-I don't know.
Aren't you taking that thing?
-Leave it.
I'll take it tomorrow.
When will you get married?
-Ask him.
Miss, bring me the file of Albert Duvivier.
It's a machine to pick up shit with, not girls.
And how often have I told you to wear your helmet?
Can I speak to the boss?
-I'm your direct superior.
I want to speak to whoever makes the rules, not to who enforces them.
Can you swim?
-Breast stroke.
Swim into the Atlantic Ocean and you might see him.
Damn.
That's not clear.
Repeat, please.
-Your position, Victoria?
I repeat 42 North, 26 West.
Still the same.
Speak clearly, dear.
I ask him to call you.
-In an hour.
I have things to do.
End of call.
-Fine.
So that's 42 North...
That's not my position at all.
Hello, Saint-Lys.
Is there anybody at the pump?
-Céline.
I'm here.
What do I have to do?
-Help them with the crossing.
How long will that take?
-Two weeks.
Will I be washing dishes for two weeks?
Victoria Lion Starting Point
I'll summarize.
Take it easy with the pills.
What's more important...
Are you listening?
Take your boat out mornings, afternoons and evenings... and get far away from us, for at least a month.
You can't quit smoking like that either.
Want to bet?
Is it that serious?
-It's in your head.
That's good.
I'll see you at dinner.
Are you still with Martine?
-I'll tell you later.
Jean-Philippe, your father's not doing well.
I fear a nervous breakdown.
He shouldn't continue to live close to his work.
It's not good to live in a caravan, especially for him.
I'll give him a prescription, but talk to him.
We have to get through to him.
Is he doing that bad?
What is happiness then?
-You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
Well, happiness is... it's...
When there is no trouble.
And you have to keep it that way.
You must be very tired to talk like that.
What tired you out the most in life?
Your mother.
Didn't you love her a bit?
-Yes.
Or you wouldn't have been born.
And did you love Jean-Philippe's mother?
Can't we talk about something else?
-You don't want to talk about anyone.
Are you angry with me?
I'm glad you still look human.
You should see the car.
Can you explain to me why we don't get along, dad?
I've sent you to schools that were too good.
While we both run Victoria, I can't be myself.
Hold on a bit longer.
I won't stay for long.
That's not what I mean.
You sleep at Victoria, you eat it, you drink it.
You sail Victoria.
It's all you think about.
We never have time to talk.
To spend an evening together.
Do you really want to cross the ocean?
-I've been sailing for 30 years.
The bay of St. Tropez isn't the same thing.
Anything urgent?
I'm not available for anyone.
You can't do this.
Can't I go out on the ocean?
-You're abandoning 12,000 employees.
No, I'm not.
I'm selling a company.
Quite a company.
You can't.
You are the company.
Who can buy a company like that?
-What about these walls?
What will you do with the money?
-I haven't had a break for 50 years.
Two days of holiday and you'll go mad.
-I want to try.
The doctor said he won't start again.
-What should I do?
Look.
-What should I do?
Ride a bicycle.
Look at him.
He goes from one to the next.
Look.
I want to write a book.
Think I can?
-A book?
Why not?
And I want to go to the US.
-Is he American?
Unbelievable.
You always take me to the circus.
-Of course.
My two big passions in life.
When I was young, I always wanted to marry you.
And now?
-I'd be too scared you'd leave me.
But I do want someone like you.
Shall I tell you something?
I'm not a good catch.
I don't believe that.
-It's true.
What's a good catch?
-Someone who doesn't think too much.
That only leaves the idiots.
-Don't believe that.
Better late than never.
You're even late on the day of your divorce.
Especially then.
Don't they know what the party's for?
-I was waiting for you.
Is this a joke?
-Don't pull that face.
It's a party.
You should celebrate the day of escape, not the day of imprisonment.
Isn't she beautiful, my divorced wife?
You look good.
-So do you.
Will she be in time?
-I think so.
When did she decide to come back?
-The day before yesterday.
I knew she wouldn't like New-York.
She's too French.
What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Everything's fine.
Look, there she is.
What has she got in her arms?
-She'll explain later.
You explain it to me.
-He's six months old and his name's Sam.
His name's Sam, he's six months old and I'm the grandfather.
Is that right?
Where's the father?
Not here.
Of course.
Does the father know, at least?
It's better like this.
Do you want to know what I really think?
I'm the happiest man in the world.
Look, he's got my eyes.
Not because she's my daughter, but it's great.
I would love it if you could publish it.
If there's a problem, you know where to find me.
Don't tell my daughter, please.
What are you doing here?
-Your pills.
Those pills.
They're alright, it's the rest.
Everything goes wrong.
Wait.
I told you to be here before the personnel.
What's this?
Do you call this advertising?
Everything you do, I have to do again.
Did they pay?
Good, I'll call you back right away.
We'll see each other tonight.
Did you read your sister's book?
-What's it about then?
A 25 year old girl falls in love with a 50 year old man.
He's a bit like you.
-And then?
He gives everything up to go with her.
That's why it's called 'Starting Point'.
How are you?
-Excellent.
I can't hear you well.
-Excellent!
Are you coming back soon?
-Not really.
We're all coming to the harbour.
And my son?
-We haven't seen him much.
When will you be back?
-In a couple of days.
Why?
Are there problems?
Not really, but we have to make some decisions.
Well, take them.
Hello?
I can't hear you anymore.
Hello?
I can't hear anything anymore.
Finished.
Is this really it?
-Yes.
How can I reach you?
-I'll write when I get there.
It's far away, isn't it?
-Yes, it's Africa.
Where is it exactly?
-I don't know yet.
I'll find out.
What can I say?
If it fails, I'll be here.
I know.
You're always here.
Alright, dad.
Take care.
Goodbye.
It's in a hurry.

Remember what you told me last week?
-Last week I was tired.
As far as eating, drinking and fucking are concerned, animals do better than we.
You're talking like a spoiled child.
Animals die of heart attacks too.
What about priests and heart attacks?
What reunites us here is his love of others.
Many of us know that he didn't need much reason to come to our help.
I've often heard him complain about the company and talk about selling... but then he'd think of all of you and nothing changed.
Victoria and Jean-Philippe, you now have to survive this storm.
He once told me... if you love sun, rain and wind, you have to believe in God.
Let's pray for the days that he did believe.
Do you really speak French?
-If you want to talk to us, yes.
A taxi driver told me this was the place to go in Hamburg.
It's 300 marks for an hour, 1000 marks for a night... and free if you marry me.
I need false papers.
You'd have to go to granny.
She has the most contacts.
Careful, there's a lot of police here.
-I didn't do anything.
What's your speciality?
-Anything, if you pay.
Did granny explain?
I don't make papers, I find them.
-That's better.
With the Cologne Carnival approaching, it won't take very long.
Is Cologne far?
-400 kilometres.
Is it nice?
-It's special.
Want to know why I do this work?
You don't want to talk?
When you ask someone how they are, you take a big risk.
Don't you like me?
My daughter's your age.
I don't know anyone who loves the carnival this much.
Me neither.
Will you really use those 20 tickets?
-I have nothing else to do.
Well done.
Have you got work?
-Not really.
Come.
Come.
Mr Van den Berghe, architect.
50,000 dollars for one hour.
What do I have to do?
Deliver three bags at Düsseldorf Station.
Three bags?
It's only the two of them.
I'm sorry.
I always work alone.
Your passport, please.
I see you also fly to New-York.
Cancel Tokyo.
Tokyo?
-Cancel it.
Do you also fly to Papeete?
-Cancel New-York.
Give me Papeete.
Papeete.
If you tell me what you're looking for, I might be able to help.
Good question.
First, I'll go for some sun.
It's the wet season there.
Where do they go when it rains?
Papeete after all then?
I only have smoking.
I'll start smoking again then.
Are you doing that bad?
Ladies and gentlemen, we're descending towards Papeete.
It's 39 degrees.
Tighten your seatbelts.

Isn't that jacket warm?
-A bit.
Why do you wear it?
-To protect myself.
Do you believe that yourself?
It's because Yvette gave it to you in Singapore.
Where did you put the jacket, sir?
On my bag, when I bought my ticket to Papeete.
The car will come later.
This is a honeymoon.
When there won't be much of me left anymore
Stop, Yvette.
You were very sweet at the cemetery, yesterday.
I wanted to bring you flowers.
It was the first time I saw you cry.
Can I touch you?
How do you like Jean-Philippe?
-You're rather hard on him.
You didn't raise him.
Yvette.
Come back, damnit!
Where were you?
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
That happens with ghosts.
Careful, or I'll leave again.
A little kiss.
Smile.
Perfect.

Van den Berghe, Belgium.
Architect?
Are there many French here?
-The whole kitchen crew's French.
Where are you from?
-Belgium.
A Belgian beer.
With foam?
-Without.
Yes, that's better.
On holiday.
Victoria Falls?
It's beautiful.
I'll put something under the table-leg.
It's the humidity.
Where's my bungalow?
Which number?
Number 12.
I'll take you there.
You don't seem to need a guide?
-I've got a good map.
Nice to have a Frenchman here.
-A Belgian.
But you don't have a Belgian accent.
-I can produce one.
Tomorrow morning, the elephants might have breakfast with you.
Do you like animals?
-They're interesting.
This is Snow White's house.
There are lots of mosquito's here.
Will you stay for long?
Are you a cop or a barman?
I may have come across confused.
You look like an uncle of mine, but without a beard.
Here, thanks.
Dinner's at 7:30.
I'll go for a walk.
Alright.
Breakfast is at 6:30.
They're going for it.
I have nothing to eat.
Are you going with us?
Don't you have a guide?
Excuse me.
Hello.
-Hello, sir.
Early bird?
I've got the day off.
Did you take good pictures?
-Yes, you with the lions.
Any more?
-No.
What's that?
From when is this?
-It's been in the hotel for months.
Did you show it to anyone?
-No, no one.
Behind you.
Don't turn around.
It's your fault that I ended up here.
All this talk about Victoria.
I was one of the 12,000 employees.
You were looking for roller skaters and since I was good at it...
And then I got fired.
You fired me.
What's your name?
Albert Duvivier.
They call me Al.
You're not afraid of lions.
Or of you.
Journalists always exaggerate a bit.
It's a small world.
Nobody would believe me.
Who will you tell?
I'm just saying...
Good.
Don't you feel at ease?
Stop moving around I'm getting seasick.
Why did you do it?
Because I felt like it.
Wasn't business going well?
You know enough by now.
I can keep a secret.
It's more than a secret.
If you'd explain, at least I'd understand.
I left behind what I loved the most.
Do you understand that?
No.
What's your price?
No, I won't sell them, because...
Anyway, I don't have the photos anymore.
Be honest.
You wanted to blackmail me.
No, I wanted to sell them.
-And what do you call that?
Blackmail.
I changed my mind.
Why did you do that with the lion?
Do you ever toss a coin?
Do you ever play Russian roulette?
-No, I don't.
What shall I do?
Kill you or bribe you?
I'd prefer the first solution.
No, the second.
I really don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with me either.
What's your price?
I have no price.
Like with the tip.
I won't tell anyone.
I'll work with you, if you like.
Sell everything and come here to study the lions.
You've never had 12,000 employees.
Is it true what the newspapers write?
There's something wrong.
People often go missing at sea to reappear years later.
Do you know of an island without telephone?
Just say you got a mast against your head... and have been suffering from amnesia.
Are you an author or a barman?
-I said it to help you.
Have you got any family?
My father and sister.
-What do they do?
They have a hotel.
Well...
There's hotels and hotels.
I can understand you wanted to abandon 12,000 employees.
I can also understand you wanted to abandon your wife or wives.
I can understand all that.
But I can't understand how you could abandon your children.
You're driving too fast, sir.
Where are we going?
Where?
-To my children.
'It would be a pleasure to work with you if you come back to France.
I'm asking you because of your youth, your talent and your success in Canada.
And also because I can see many similarities between you and me.
Our company needs a man like you.
I hope to welcome you soon.
Sam Lion. '
So you're the last person to see my father?
At least, I'm the last person to have dined with him.
How did you get to know him?
He contacted me because I had a similar company as he.
In Canada.
Montreal.
And why did you leave Canada?
I was homesick.
France will always be France.
Of course.
The letter, the handwriting...
It affects me.
And?
Once I brought up the circus, all doors opened up.
And Jean-Philippe?
-He asked when you wrote the letter.
Just before you sailed off, I said.
We had had dinner, just like you told me.
We talked business and just before you left, you gave me the letter.
Did you tell him the way you're telling me now?
Yes, but I was...
-More at ease.
Yes, completely at ease.
Did you understand why the company's doing so bad?
I tried to find out more.
He explained things to me, but it was very technical.
I don't think I completely understood him.
He talked about debts the company had when you died.
Debts?
Go away.
I'll explain.
We have to play it very safe.
Are you ready?
What do you mean, safe?
From now on, don't do or say anything without talking to me first.
Within half a year, you'll be a captain of industry.
You'll have to wear another suit.
Pinstripe suits are out.
Tomorrow, you'll get a room in the city.
In a fancy hotel.
Four stars.
But you have to learn to say hello.
-Excuse me?
Saying hello properly is one of the most important things in life.
It's half the job.
Say hello to me.
No, with conviction.
Say hello as if I'm ill.
Again.
Now, I feel you're more interested in me than in yourself.
People prefer that you talk about them, rather than about yourself.
Say hello again.
That wasn't good.
I noticed it.
You can feel it yourself now, right?
Can I smile?
-As long as it's with compassion.
Don't smile too hard.
You'll often be confronted with things you don't know.
Pretend you know them.
The best way to suggest you know everything... is to never show surprise.
Understood?
You often show surprise.
That's your weakness.
We'll do a test.
I'll say a few things and you can't look surprised.
Understood?
Concentrate.
Did you know your father used to get it on with the petrol station attendant?
I don't want to see surprise.
-Yes, but that...
You just can't show surprise.
Imagine your father with the petrol station attendant.
There you go again.
-Another example.
It's a gripping example.
-It is.
Concentrate.
You look like Jesus.
You're doing it again.
Can't I do anything?
-No, nothing.
Look into the distance.
-Absent-minded?
Not too much.
Nothing.
Yes?
-Go on then because I...
Now I see surprise because I'm not saying anything.
I'd be surprised.
I did exactly as you said.
I like you.
I don't know if...
-That's surprising.
Is this still part of the test or...
-Of course.
But you said...
-Don't let it surprise you.
Alright.
Are you religious?
I don't know.
To my son, you're deeply religious.
To my daughter, you're an atheist.
And to you?
-I only believe in mathematics.
We get what we deserve.
Do I deserve to be here with you?
I'm starting to think so.
There he is.
Say hello.
Coffee?
Did you sleep well?
You get used to it.
Look, nice and fresh.
Do you still want to give us a hand?
-Of course.
She'll show you around.
I'm going to the pump.
What did you do in Belgium?
-I was with the circus.
I love the circus.
-I was only a bookkeeper.
Will you stay for long?
-Until I get a work permit.
Has Alex left yet?
I hope he'll be successful for once.
You have to go and buy stuff.
We're out of things.
Did it use to look like that?
-Yes, we were almost in the woods.
I'm here for Mr Jean-Philippe Lion.
Mr Duvivier for you.
My sister, Victoria.
Mr Verne, our notary.
An old friend, who'll do the talking.
In which part of Canada were you?
The factories were up north.
The office was in Montreal.
Beautiful country.
Our company's about to be taken over.
You understand we can't hire you.
I'm prepared to accept a trial period.
At no expense.
That's very friendly.
But we have more problems, that we can't talk about.
Can I say something?
When you saw dad, was he alright?
Yes, he's fine.
Was fine.
-My sister asks because... when he left, he was very tired and depressed.
We even thought of suicide.
-Not at all.
Your father's... was in good shape... both physically and mentally.
So don't worry.
You don't agree to a trial period?
We do...
-No, Victoria.
I consider that letter to be dad's last instructions.
Of course.
I'll let you talk amongst yourselves.
I'll say hello.
I mean goodbye.
I'm jetlagged.
See you soon.
I'll show you out.
How's your mother?
-Fine.
And little Sam?
-All fine.
Sorry, but it failed.
I did what I could, but they didn't want it.
Your son and daughter agreed, but... the notary was completely against it.
He said they're firing people at the moment and can't hire anyone.
Sit down.
The notary seemed to be in charge.
I did exactly what you said.
I never showed any surprise.
That notary's starting to surprise me.
Really?
I was also surprised... but I didn't show it.
What are you doing there?
I haven't been able to explain everything.
When I dined with Sam Lion in New-York, just before his departure... he gave me the letter of recommendation... and also a suitcase with important documents.
He made a last minute decision not to take it with him.
Check his face to see how he takes that information.
If he seems worried, you're on the right track.
Keep going.
One of those documents is a copy of his last will.
Some manipulation seems to have occurred between... what the document says and the beneficiaries.
When he starts thinking and becomes curious... he'll no doubt continue the conversation himself.
I'm listening.
This is my proposition...
You do everything I say... or I'll show the documents to the parties involved.
He won't speak for a long time.
Then he'll say those documents are false and you're blackmailing him... that you're a fraud.
-You want to blackmail me.
Those papers must be false.
-Perfect...
Then you stay silent even longer.
Keep looking him in the eye... without blinking and without showing any surprise.
That way you'll scare him.
It's all in the eyes, And then you'll say:
Then the children will have to choose between a blackmailer and a crook.
You'll see him regain some hope.
And he'll try something else.
A blackmailer and a crook...
may go well together.
If he wants to collaborate, that's it.
Don't say anything but look... the way Elliott Ness looked when Al Capone wanted to bribe him... and wait until he bows his head.
Maybe he'll raise his head for a moment like a floored boxer.
Look him in the eye.
And then knock him out.
He seems like a fine man.
A great man.
Your father really wanted him.
A rara avis.
If he sings as well as he looks... it would be stupid not to use him.
What do you think?
When I saw the letter, I agreed right away.
And since I wanted to slow down a bit, this is the moment.
Never hint at the notary's embezzling.
This is an impressive office.
Can I look around?
Treat Jean-Philippe very carefully.
Dad must have told you about his love of the circus.
He wanted to turn his office into a circus museum.
Not very functional.
Never go against Jean-Philippe.
He has a passion for architecture.
He told me a lot about his passion for lions.
Yes, lions were his big passion.
What I hate about this type of architecture... is that there is no separation between the workers and the board.
That's the circus, the team spirit.
My father always said: a boss has to be able to see what the personnel are doing.
and the personnel always have to know where the boss is.
He's got a point.
-But it's impractical.
Yes, you're right.
Then you'll be assigned an office.
When you're alone, call me.
If he asks where you live...
Where do you live?
-Since I came back from Canada...
I've been staying with my dad, outside of Paris.
It's quiet.
Telephone.
-I'll take it there.
Here, you do it.
Ask for the balance sheets of the past three years... with all the corresponding documents.
Or else you won't make any decision.
Bring them tonight.
It went fine with your son.
Better than with your daughter.
A list of urgent things.
Give it to my secretary.
When I call and you can't speak, cough.
Always ask for time to think.
Bring your portable phone.
You have to explain this.
-We've got all night.
Did you ask my secretary to find you a room?
-Yes.
Did you discuss your salary?
-Yes, I told them what you told me.
I keep saying to Jean-Philippe that we'll discuss it later.
About my son...
It's normal that he's nice to you.
He's always nice to young people.
By the way, tell your father not to eavesdrop.
Or ask him to help us.
Can we get some too?
Telephone.
Are you available for dinner tonight?
Such a smart computer can't be wrong.
Ask for a printed copy.
We have to be on top of this.
Take your time.
I'm busy.
That gives me an excuse not to go tonight.
I'm coming over.
Am I interrupting?
-Not at all.
Come in.
My mother wants to meet you.
She's inviting you to dinner.
I'd love to, thanks.
Is tonight alright?
Tonight's difficult, because there's a problem in South America.
I have to see him...
I have to read all the files.
I'll see if I can cancel my dinner.
Have a seat.
I'll be right back.
Anything wrong?
-No, I'm going with Jean-Philippe.
Dad's hat?
-I'm always wearing it.
How's mum?
-She's nostalgic.
That's her.
-I know.
I couldn't cancel the dinner.
So I can't tonight.
But some time next week's fine.
-We'll do that then.
I also wanted to thank you for everything you're doing for us.
It's nothing special.
Dad would be very jealous if he saw you.
I understand he liked you.
-You're impressive too.
You still dress the same way.
How do you know?
-I know all about you.
He tells me things every day.
Told me.
He told me about you each night.
You're a bit like him.
-Do you think?
Not physically... but your attitude, your boldness.
The way you greet people, how calm you are, things like that.
Have a seat.
I'll try one more time to cancel my dinner.
I'll be right back.
Do I have to continue to pretend?
-When I say no, it's no.
They keep talking about you.
You're still important in their lives.
That's why I left.
Do you still not understand?
I noticed that your daughter... is a bit like you.
You should really consider going back to them.
If I wanted that, I wouldn't go through all this trouble.
They're not biting today.
-We're not forced to fish either.
Alright, I'll go.
You spend lots of money on unnecessary things.
And you don't keep check of your expenses, That's not good.
And the way you chase the personnel.
I'm embarrassed.
Is that all?
-No.
Al's fed up with the hotel and wants to live in dad's caravan.
Can I come in?
-Make yourself at home.
This is your house now.
Not very nice, this close to work.
Didn't your dad like it?
-Yes, but he loved the circus.
Don't you?
-No, I hate it.
I'm surprised.
Your sister loves it, I believe.
Yes, she does.
Is it on tonight?
Tonight?
Oh, tonight.
I wanted to say I'm happy about how we work together.
We're a very good team.
It seems best to me to keep it strictly business.
I'm here, Jean-Philippe.
Oh, is it you?
-I wanted to know if you're alright.
This is a very luxurious caravan.
I'm very grateful.
I'll be off then.
What do you think of him?
-Strapping.
I like blacks who are really black.
He is.
We're in a very difficult situation.
Goal.
Yes, goal.
You're kidding me.
There are some bad things happening here.
You're having fun, but I'm not having fun with your computers.
This is a misunderstanding.
It's not my birthday today.
This is because you've been with us for a year.
That's nice of you.
Shall I blow the candle?
There's something else.
-Where are we going?
With a birthday comes a present.
Dad loves old-timers.
We want to give you one.
-You can't.
Choose one.
No, you can't.
-Yes.
You love those cars.
I can't accept it.
I couldn't choose anyway.
They're all beautiful.
I wouldn't know.
I'll just pick the closest one.
I'm speechless.
-Dad once put it very well:
Never give someone a present that you don't love yourself.
I'm driving a car that used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson.
Unbelievable.
I'd like to have lunch together.
I'd rather have dinner with you.
-That's alright too.
I'll introduce you to someone who might become important to me.
Since you've taken over dad's role, I want to hear your opinion.
Are you planning on getting married?
-Yes, if he agrees.
If he agrees?
Why not?
I don't know who it is.
She'll introduce me to him.
It's simple: if he's ok, you approve.
And if not, I reject him?
-Of course.
Talking about marriage.
Céline's getting married today.
A beautiful car, isn't it?
Beautiful family.
-Yes, they're nice.
Is something wrong?
Family makes you think of family.
-That's true.
But why do you say that?
I'd like to see them again.
Just once.
Once.
How did you end up here?
I was here for work and I was almost out of petrol.
I saw this petrol station attendant who looks just like your dad.
Everyone has a double.
-Exactly.
He's not a real copy of your father, of course.
That's a nice ride.
Perfect.
Where's the hole?
It's well hidden.
They don't make them like this anymore.
-It's from'57-'58.
It used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson, the boxer.
You had La Motta and Dauthuille.
I remember Dauthuille well.
Graziano was the world champion.
He never gave up.
Always attacked.
Bang, and down.
I've seen Robinson box against Big Man.
Ray was good... and he had a good left hook... but he didn't cut it.
Not enough stamina.
Striking, isn't it?
-Yes, unbelievable.
He doesn't really look like him, but it's how he acts.
And Max Schmeling... he was very fast.
The way he'd come back with a left hook.
He was younger.
But he'd look a bit like this now.
Did anyone ever tell you, you look a lot like Sam Lion?
How's that?
-Sam Lion.
What weight category?
-No, a business man.
A business man?
Me?
No, kid.
That's full again.
That's 400 francs.
Yes, it's a guzzler.
500, I have to change that.
-No, never mind.
Well, thanks.
You're as generous as Robinson.
Could you do the windscreen?
-Of course, that's part of the job.
For that money, I'd polish your shoes.
That lady has beautiful eyes.
One moment.
If you're in a hurry, do it yourself.
It's true...
strong as a bear.
I don't mean it in a bad way... but I get the impression your fiancé's not very polite.
He's always very punctual.
There are always exceptions to the rule.
He's also very special.
Wait, this is wrong.
You're influencing the jury.
I'll admit it.
I tricked you.
He's been here for a while.
He was exactly on time.
Is he in the restaurant?
At this table even.
What's that?
-He's at this table.
Do you mean that...
-Yes.
Am I dreaming or do you really want to marry me?
Only if you agree.
Careful, I might say yes.
Say yes then.
I can't.
I'd want to but...
I have to make a phone call...
right away.
I have to tell my dad.
I'm very happy.
I don't show it, because I'm surprised.
But I'm very happy.
Mr Duvivier.
-That's me.
Will you accept my daughter as your daughter-in-law?
Why do you say that?
You're son's having dinner with my daughter and she's proposing to him.
Your daughter?
-Yes.
And your son's about to call me and ask my permission.
And you want my permission?
Is your daughter a serious girl?
Your daughter was going to introduce me to her fiancé tonight.
The problem is that I'm the fiancé.
You're both adults, so do what you want.
Aren't you surprised?
-Of course, I'm surprised.
Very surprised even.
And I only have one daughter.
Alright.
Talk to you later.
Do you know where she went?
-Maybe to the ladies.
I'll close.
What are you doing here?
-And you?
That's my hat.
Are you alone?
Where's Victoria?
-I thought she'd be here.
Isn't she here?
-No.
Weren't you having dinner together?
Yes, we had started.
Didn't she ask you to marry her?
-Yes, You knew about it?
Everyone did.
-I only heard about it tonight.
It's crazy.
I've always been a bit crazy.
And you live here?
-Yes, it's a bit like a circus.
And you let me marry a clown?
Don't you like him?
-Yes.
I liked him for what you made him do.
-What he did was the hardest thing.
And you didn't make a mistake.
Did you have fun the past two years?
That's hard with so many memories.
-Why then?
I wanted to take a shortcut, but I got lost.
What do we do now?
-Find him quickly.
And call me.
Where is she?
-She left again.
Can I talk to you?
-Go ahead.
No, not here.
Not here anymore.
Was this it?
-Yes.
Are you sure?
-Yes.
Now she knows.
-Listen.
I'm not listening.
I'll get worked up when I want.
It's over.
Finished.
Now I want to say something.
You listen to me for a change.
Do you know what you are?
A spoiled child that breaks its toys.
Your wives... your children, your company.
And now you're destroying me, but you won't succeed.
You taught me to be strong.
What are you thinking?
That you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion?
Come on.
Do you think you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion?
He's learning fast.
-He's getting there.
He's doing well.
Dad, it's me.
He's not in the caravan, not in the office.
He's nowhere.
He'll be back.
In a bad mood, but he'll be back.
Call me when he arrives.
Talk to you later.
Some days, I don't understand...
Shall we have a drink?
He's still not here.
I was in the caravan all this time.
He'll be there.
-It's almost five.
Did you call him in his car?
Do that and call me back.
Don't talk to anyone.
-I promise.
Bye.
I love you, dad.
Where's that asshole?
Al, what are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm in Thoiry.
The African part.
I want to ask you a very important question.
He called.
He arrived.
Do you think we can make him come back one day?
He gave me this, just before he left.
He always carried this with him.
LOOK AFTER HIM.
I BEG YOU.
LOOK AFTER HIM.
I BEG YOU.
-He's at his final destination now.
Did your father say that?
-Yes.
Sam we're going home.
Get up, mummy.
We won't get separated anymore.
Do I have to run you over?
See you tomorrow.
when Isabel sleeps nothing moves when Isabelle sleeps in her cradle of joy
do you know that she pilfers, the little scoundrel the oases of the Sahara the golden fish of China and the gardens of the Alhambra?
when Isabelle sleeps nothing moves when Isabelle sleeps in her cradle of joy
she robs the dreams and the games of a rose and a butter cup to put them in her eyes beautiful Isabelle, when she sleeps
when Isabelle laughs nothing moves when Isabelle laughs in her cradle of joy
do you know that she robs, the little mean one the laughter of the wild cascades which serve as a purse to kings without a retinue?
when Isabelle laughs nothing moves when Isabelle laughs in her cradle of joy
she robs the windows of their gold opening onto paradise to put it into her heart beautiful Isabelle, when she laughs
when Isabelle sings nothing moves when Isabelle sings in her cradle of joy
do you know that she robs the lace spun in the heart of nightingales and the kisses which umbrellas keep from taking flight?

She robs the velvet and the silk which the guitar yields to the Infanta to put them into her voice beautiful Isabelle, when she sings
Everyone is alone and no one cares about anyone
And our pains are a deserted island...
To Jacques Brel.
who will give a circus show for me nostalgic love in the dust who will make me go "I'm scared"
the knife in the heart, in the limelight who will treat me like a tigress the whip like a caress to the music who will make me balance between balloons full of pathos sometimes I panic
who will tell me words of love that can hurt who will hold me
ITINERARY OF A SPOILED CHILD when you'll release all the stars who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore
who will still make me dream the clown or the rider who emerges from the shadow who will still bring me the artist's performance the trapeze artist's show see him fall who will still bring me the child that plays
for the performing dogs or the vampires
Don't you have a ticket?
Where's your mother?
Where?
In the bar?
Wait, I'll check.
This boy says his mother's in the bar.
Could you have a look?
Ask for the mother of the boy.
Wait a moment.
What's your name?
Sam?
What have you got there?
Can I have a look?
Is that your mother's?
Sam's three years old.
I can't keep him.
I'm desperate.
Look after him.
I beg you.
three years later
Sam, 13 years old
Sam, 16 years old
it has a silver shine the itinerary of a spoiled child is littered with broken toys
the itinerary of a spoiled child
The last time I saw him, was just before he left.
He wanted to get to know himself.
This solitary voyage was a challenge he added to all the storms in his life.
He always said: when I spend some hours with you, I want to believe.
When I spend an evening with my children, I want to believe in family.
When I'm with a woman, I want to believe in love.
That's Sam Lion for you.
You know why he was called that, don't you?
He was found near a circus and when he was registered... the circus master called him Sam Lion because he was always near the lions.
This is the best day of my life.
-Because it's beautiful here.
Where does all this water go?
-To Lake Kariba.
It's beautiful.
Rainbows come straight out of the water.
The most beautiful spot in the world.
Will we see all of that?
You and I?
Look a rainbow.
Quick.
Make a wish.
When he falls from the trapeze, he becomes a street sweeper... so he can stay with the carnival.
He wins a prize for best sweeper and gets the award from Yvette... who becomes his wife.
They have a son, Jean-Philippe.
Then the big drama happens in Singapore.
He has to raise Jean-Philippe on his own.
It takes him ten years to recover and meet Corine.
Ten years to turn his little business into an international company.
Ten years before he can smile again upon seeing a child's face.
Magnificent.
You look more and more like your mother.
-Then you must be starting to hate me.
Whose idea was it to go here?
-Mine.
I wanted to go to Venice, but Corine had already been there.
Then I realised they have even more water here.
Who decided to call me Victoria?
-Your mother.
She's sure you were conceived here.
In this area.
I'm glad it wasn't near the Niagara Falls.
You were almost called Isabelle.
Because I loved Jacques Brels song.
It's about his daughter.
But because of this spectacle, you became Victoria.
How did you get the business?
After my accident, I was responsible for keeping the circus clean.
I looked for machines to do the work.
What shall we do tonight?
American dinner, tamtam, birthday cake, champagne.
The good life.
Doesn't that give you ideas?
-Why not?
I watched them this morning.
It's great what they do.
Look, he's the best one.
Unbelievable what he does.
Imagine, autumn on the Champs-Elysées.
'Ballet with Brooms'.
When will the machines be introduced?
-In a month.
How did you get the idea?
My daughter and I saw them on our travels and we improved on them.
They say a minister is interested in buying them.
That makes sense.
It's of interest to the public.
Are you really going to buy a circus that has gone bankrupt?
I love the circus, but that's nonsense.
I only hired people who were about to be fired.
This is my secretary, by the way.
The only secretary to land safely after a death-defying leap.
Most of the time.
How did you become the biggest in your trade, in 10 years?
Step in the shit often and always clean it up.
So this machine will replace street sweepers?
This machine can clean 10 kilometres per day.
A person can do 1 kilometre.
The operator can also use the machine as a mode of transport.
But most of all, the operator doesn't make contact with the garbage anymore.
The work will get a better reputation and will also be performed by students.
So, sweepers will be unemployed.
The machine can't reach everywhere and traditional sweepers are still required.
But they should learn to use roller-skates.
Do you find this funny?
-Not at all.
I need to talk to you.
-I understand.
What do you mean?
-I'm just saying I understand.
I don't want to go to the hotel.
It's not a hotel, it's where I live.
It's also about the rest.
What?
I don't have anything.
This machine's my first moped.
What do you want?
What do I have to do to keep you?
Drive a pink Cadillac?
Wait a moment.
Wait.
Here, this is for you.
What is it?
-Have a look.
I'd like to take you there.
Near Victoria Falls.
Are you going?
Alright.
Can I keep this?
-It's a present.
Will you be roller-skating for long?
-I don't know.
Aren't you taking that thing?
-Leave it.
I'll take it tomorrow.
When will you get married?
-Ask him.
Miss, bring me the file of Albert Duvivier.
It's a machine to pick up shit with, not girls.
And how often have I told you to wear your helmet?
Can I speak to the boss?
-I'm your direct superior.
I want to speak to whoever makes the rules, not to who enforces them.
Can you swim?
-Breast stroke.
Swim into the Atlantic Ocean and you might see him.
Damn.
That's not clear.
Repeat, please.
-Your position, Victoria?
I repeat 42 North, 26 West.
Still the same.
Speak clearly, dear.
I ask him to call you.
-In an hour.
I have things to do.
End of call.
-Fine.
So that's 42 North...
That's not my position at all.
Hello, Saint-Lys.
Is there anybody at the pump?
-Céline.
I'm here.
What do I have to do?
-Help them with the crossing.
How long will that take?
-Two weeks.
Will I be washing dishes for two weeks?
Victoria Lion Starting Point
I'll summarize.
Take it easy with the pills.
What's more important...
Are you listening?
Take your boat out mornings, afternoons and evenings... and get far away from us, for at least a month.
You can't quit smoking like that either.
Want to bet?
Is it that serious?
-It's in your head.
That's good.
I'll see you at dinner.
Are you still with Martine?
-I'll tell you later.
Jean-Philippe, your father's not doing well.
I fear a nervous breakdown.
He shouldn't continue to live close to his work.
It's not good to live in a caravan, especially for him.
I'll give him a prescription, but talk to him.
We have to get through to him.
Is he doing that bad?
What is happiness then?
-You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
Well, happiness is... it's...
When there is no trouble.
And you have to keep it that way.
You must be very tired to talk like that.
What tired you out the most in life?
Your mother.
Didn't you love her a bit?
-Yes.
Or you wouldn't have been born.
And did you love Jean-Philippe's mother?
Can't we talk about something else?
-You don't want to talk about anyone.
Are you angry with me?
I'm glad you still look human.
You should see the car.
Can you explain to me why we don't get along, dad?
I've sent you to schools that were too good.
While we both run Victoria, I can't be myself.
Hold on a bit longer.
I won't stay for long.
That's not what I mean.
You sleep at Victoria, you eat it, you drink it.
You sail Victoria.
It's all you think about.
We never have time to talk.
To spend an evening together.
Do you really want to cross the ocean?
-I've been sailing for 30 years.
The bay of St. Tropez isn't the same thing.
Anything urgent?
I'm not available for anyone.
You can't do this.
Can't I go out on the ocean?
-You're abandoning 12,000 employees.
No, I'm not.
I'm selling a company.
Quite a company.
You can't.
You are the company.
Who can buy a company like that?
-What about these walls?
What will you do with the money?
-I haven't had a break for 50 years.
Two days of holiday and you'll go mad.
-I want to try.
The doctor said he won't start again.
-What should I do?
Look.
-What should I do?
Ride a bicycle.
Look at him.
He goes from one to the next.
Look.
I want to write a book.
Think I can?
-A book?
Why not?
And I want to go to the US.
-Is he American?
Unbelievable.
You always take me to the circus.
-Of course.
My two big passions in life.
When I was young, I always wanted to marry you.
And now?
-I'd be too scared you'd leave me.
But I do want someone like you.
Shall I tell you something?
I'm not a good catch.
I don't believe that.
-It's true.
What's a good catch?
-Someone who doesn't think too much.
That only leaves the idiots.
-Don't believe that.
Better late than never.
You're even late on the day of your divorce.
Especially then.
Don't they know what the party's for?
-I was waiting for you.
Is this a joke?
-Don't pull that face.
It's a party.
You should celebrate the day of escape, not the day of imprisonment.
Isn't she beautiful, my divorced wife?
You look good.
-So do you.
Will she be in time?
-I think so.
When did she decide to come back?
-The day before yesterday.
I knew she wouldn't like New-York.
She's too French.
What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Everything's fine.
Look, there she is.
What has she got in her arms?
-She'll explain later.
You explain it to me.
-He's six months old and his name's Sam.
His name's Sam, he's six months old and I'm the grandfather.
Is that right?
Where's the father?
Not here.
Of course.
Does the father know, at least?
It's better like this.
Do you want to know what I really think?
I'm the happiest man in the world.
Look, he's got my eyes.
Not because she's my daughter, but it's great.
I would love it if you could publish it.
If there's a problem, you know where to find me.
Don't tell my daughter, please.
What are you doing here?
-Your pills.
Those pills.
They're alright, it's the rest.
Everything goes wrong.
Wait.
I told you to be here before the personnel.
What's this?
Do you call this advertising?
Everything you do, I have to do again.
Did they pay?
Good, I'll call you back right away.
We'll see each other tonight.
Did you read your sister's book?
-What's it about then?
A 25 year old girl falls in love with a 50 year old man.
He's a bit like you.
-And then?
He gives everything up to go with her.
That's why it's called 'Starting Point'.
How are you?
-Excellent.
I can't hear you well.
-Excellent!
Are you coming back soon?
-Not really.
We're all coming to the harbour.
And my son?
-We haven't seen him much.
When will you be back?
-In a couple of days.
Why?
Are there problems?
Not really, but we have to make some decisions.
Well, take them.
Hello?
I can't hear you anymore.
Hello?
I can't hear anything anymore.
Finished.
Is this really it?
-Yes.
How can I reach you?
-I'll write when I get there.
It's far away, isn't it?
-Yes, it's Africa.
Where is it exactly?
-I don't know yet.
I'll find out.
What can I say?
If it fails, I'll be here.
I know.
You're always here.
Alright, dad.
Take care.
Goodbye.
It's in a hurry.
who will give a circus show for me nostalgic love in the dust
who will make me go "I'm scared"
the knife in the heart, in the limelight who will treat me like a tigress the whip like a caress to music who will make me balance between balloons full of pathos sometimes I panic
who will tell me words of love that can hurt
-Good morning.
who will hold me when you'll release all the stars
who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore
who will still make me cry the clown or the rider who emerges from the shadow who will still bring me the artist's performance the trapeze artist's show see him fall who will still bring me the child that plays
for the performing dogs or the vampires who will do the final act for me to seduce me to smile
who will tell me words of love that can hurt who will hold me when you'll release all the stars
who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore
Remember what you told me last week?
-Last week I was tired.
As far as eating, drinking and fucking are concerned, animals do better than we.
You're talking like a spoiled child.
Animals die of heart attacks too.
What about priests and heart attacks?
What reunites us here is his love of others.
Many of us know that he didn't need much reason to come to our help.
I've often heard him complain about the company and talk about selling... but then he'd think of all of you and nothing changed.
Victoria and Jean-Philippe, you now have to survive this storm.
He once told me... if you love sun, rain and wind, you have to believe in God.
Let's pray for the days that he did believe.
Do you really speak French?
-If you want to talk to us, yes.
A taxi driver told me this was the place to go in Hamburg.
It's 300 marks for an hour, 1000 marks for a night... and free if you marry me.
I need false papers.
You'd have to go to granny.
She has the most contacts.
Careful, there's a lot of police here.
-I didn't do anything.
What's your speciality?
-Anything, if you pay.
Did granny explain?
I don't make papers, I find them.
-That's better.
With the Cologne Carnival approaching, it won't take very long.
Is Cologne far?
-400 kilometres.
Is it nice?
-It's special.
Want to know why I do this work?
You don't want to talk?
When you ask someone how they are, you take a big risk.
Don't you like me?
My daughter's your age.
I don't know anyone who loves the carnival this much.
Me neither.
Will you really use those 20 tickets?
-I have nothing else to do.
Well done.
Have you got work?
-Not really.
Come.
Come.
Mr Van den Berghe, architect.
50,000 dollars for one hour.
What do I have to do?
Deliver three bags at Düsseldorf Station.
Three bags?
It's only the two of them.
I'm sorry.
I always work alone.
Your passport, please.
I see you also fly to New-York.
Cancel Tokyo.
Tokyo?
-Cancel it.
Do you also fly to Papeete?
-Cancel New-York.
Give me Papeete.
Papeete.
If you tell me what you're looking for, I might be able to help.
Good question.
First, I'll go for some sun.
It's the wet season there.
Where do they go when it rains?
Papeete after all then?
I only have smoking.
I'll start smoking again then.
Are you doing that bad?
Ladies and gentlemen, we're descending towards Papeete.
It's 39 degrees.
Tighten your seatbelts.

Isn't that jacket warm?
-A bit.
Why do you wear it?
-To protect myself.
Do you believe that yourself?
It's because Yvette gave it to you in Singapore.
Where did you put the jacket, sir?
On my bag, when I bought my ticket to Papeete.
The car will come later.
This is a honeymoon.
When there won't be much of me left anymore
Stop, Yvette.
You were very sweet at the cemetery, yesterday.
I wanted to bring you flowers.
It was the first time I saw you cry.
Can I touch you?
How do you like Jean-Philippe?
-You're rather hard on him.
You didn't raise him.
Yvette.
Come back, damnit!
Where were you?
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
That happens with ghosts.
Careful, or I'll leave again.
A little kiss.
Smile.
Perfect.

Van den Berghe, Belgium.
Architect?
Are there many French here?
-The whole kitchen crew's French.
Where are you from?
-Belgium.
A Belgian beer.
With foam?
-Without.
Yes, that's better.
On holiday.
Victoria Falls?
It's beautiful.
I'll put something under the table-leg.
It's the humidity.
Where's my bungalow?
Which number?
Number 12.
I'll take you there.
You don't seem to need a guide?
-I've got a good map.
Nice to have a Frenchman here.
-A Belgian.
But you don't have a Belgian accent.
-I can produce one.
Tomorrow morning, the elephants might have breakfast with you.
Do you like animals?
-They're interesting.
This is Snow White's house.
There are lots of mosquito's here.
Will you stay for long?
Are you a cop or a barman?
I may have come across confused.
You look like an uncle of mine, but without a beard.
Here, thanks.
Dinner's at 7:30.
I'll go for a walk.
Alright.
Breakfast is at 6:30.
They're going for it.
I have nothing to eat.
Are you going with us?
Don't you have a guide?
Excuse me.
Hello.
-Hello, sir.
Early bird?
I've got the day off.
Did you take good pictures?
-Yes, you with the lions.
Any more?
-No.
What's that?
From when is this?
-It's been in the hotel for months.
Did you show it to anyone?
-No, no one.
Behind you.
Don't turn around.
It's your fault that I ended up here.
All this talk about Victoria.
I was one of the 12,000 employees.
You were looking for roller skaters and since I was good at it...
And then I got fired.
You fired me.
What's your name?
Albert Duvivier.
They call me Al.
You're not afraid of lions.
Or of you.
Journalists always exaggerate a bit.
It's a small world.
Nobody would believe me.
Who will you tell?
I'm just saying...
Good.
Don't you feel at ease?
Stop moving around I'm getting seasick.
Why did you do it?
Because I felt like it.
Wasn't business going well?
You know enough by now.
I can keep a secret.
It's more than a secret.
If you'd explain, at least I'd understand.
I left behind what I loved the most.
Do you understand that?
No.
What's your price?
No, I won't sell them, because...
Anyway, I don't have the photos anymore.
Be honest.
You wanted to blackmail me.
No, I wanted to sell them.
-And what do you call that?
Blackmail.
I changed my mind.
Why did you do that with the lion?
Do you ever toss a coin?
Do you ever play Russian roulette?
-No, I don't.
What shall I do?
Kill you or bribe you?
I'd prefer the first solution.
No, the second.
I really don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with me either.
What's your price?
I have no price.
Like with the tip.
I won't tell anyone.
I'll work with you, if you like.
Sell everything and come here to study the lions.
You've never had 12,000 employees.
Is it true what the newspapers write?
There's something wrong.
People often go missing at sea to reappear years later.
Do you know of an island without telephone?
Just say you got a mast against your head... and have been suffering from amnesia.
Are you an author or a barman?
-I said it to help you.
Have you got any family?
My father and sister.
-What do they do?
They have a hotel.
Well...
There's hotels and hotels.
I can understand you wanted to abandon 12,000 employees.
I can also understand you wanted to abandon your wife or wives.
I can understand all that.
But I can't understand how you could abandon your children.
You're driving too fast, sir.
Where are we going?
Where?
-To my children.
'It would be a pleasure to work with you if you come back to France.
I'm asking you because of your youth, your talent and your success in Canada.
And also because I can see many similarities between you and me.
Our company needs a man like you.
I hope to welcome you soon.
Sam Lion. '
So you're the last person to see my father?
At least, I'm the last person to have dined with him.
How did you get to know him?
He contacted me because I had a similar company as he.
In Canada.
Montreal.
And why did you leave Canada?
I was homesick.
France will always be France.
Of course.
The letter, the handwriting...
It affects me.
And?
Once I brought up the circus, all doors opened up.
And Jean-Philippe?
-He asked when you wrote the letter.
Just before you sailed off, I said.
We had had dinner, just like you told me.
We talked business and just before you left, you gave me the letter.
Did you tell him the way you're telling me now?
Yes, but I was...
-More at ease.
Yes, completely at ease.
Did you understand why the company's doing so bad?
I tried to find out more.
He explained things to me, but it was very technical.
I don't think I completely understood him.
He talked about debts the company had when you died.
Debts?
Go away.
I'll explain.
We have to play it very safe.
Are you ready?
What do you mean, safe?
From now on, don't do or say anything without talking to me first.
Within half a year, you'll be a captain of industry.
You'll have to wear another suit.
Pinstripe suits are out.
Tomorrow, you'll get a room in the city.
In a fancy hotel.
Four stars.
But you have to learn to say hello.
-Excuse me?
Saying hello properly is one of the most important things in life.
It's half the job.
Say hello to me.
No, with conviction.
Say hello as if I'm ill.
Again.
Now, I feel you're more interested in me than in yourself.
People prefer that you talk about them, rather than about yourself.
Say hello again.
That wasn't good.
I noticed it.
You can feel it yourself now, right?
Can I smile?
-As long as it's with compassion.
Don't smile too hard.
You'll often be confronted with things you don't know.
Pretend you know them.
The best way to suggest you know everything... is to never show surprise.
Understood?
You often show surprise.
That's your weakness.
We'll do a test.
I'll say a few things and you can't look surprised.
Understood?
Concentrate.
Did you know your father used to get it on with the petrol station attendant?
I don't want to see surprise.
-Yes, but that...
You just can't show surprise.
Imagine your father with the petrol station attendant.
There you go again.
-Another example.
It's a gripping example.
-It is.
Concentrate.
You look like Jesus.
You're doing it again.
Can't I do anything?
-No, nothing.
Look into the distance.
-Absent-minded?
Not too much.
Nothing.
Yes?
-Go on then because I...
Now I see surprise because I'm not saying anything.
I'd be surprised.
I did exactly as you said.
I like you.
I don't know if...
-That's surprising.
Is this still part of the test or...
-Of course.
But you said...
-Don't let it surprise you.
Alright.
Are you religious?
I don't know.
To my son, you're deeply religious.
To my daughter, you're an atheist.
And to you?
-I only believe in mathematics.
We get what we deserve.
Do I deserve to be here with you?
I'm starting to think so.
There he is.
Say hello.
Coffee?
Did you sleep well?
You get used to it.
Look, nice and fresh.
Do you still want to give us a hand?
-Of course.
She'll show you around.
I'm going to the pump.
What did you do in Belgium?
-I was with the circus.
I love the circus.
-I was only a bookkeeper.
Will you stay for long?
-Until I get a work permit.
Has Alex left yet?
I hope he'll be successful for once.
You have to go and buy stuff.
We're out of things.
Did it use to look like that?
-Yes, we were almost in the woods.
I'm here for Mr Jean-Philippe Lion.
Mr Duvivier for you.
My sister, Victoria.
Mr Verne, our notary.
An old friend, who'll do the talking.
In which part of Canada were you?
The factories were up north.
The office was in Montreal.
Beautiful country.
Our company's about to be taken over.
You understand we can't hire you.
I'm prepared to accept a trial period.
At no expense.
That's very friendly.
But we have more problems, that we can't talk about.
Can I say something?
When you saw dad, was he alright?
Yes, he's fine.
Was fine.
-My sister asks because... when he left, he was very tired and depressed.
We even thought of suicide.
-Not at all.
Your father's... was in good shape... both physically and mentally.
So don't worry.
You don't agree to a trial period?
We do...
-No, Victoria.
I consider that letter to be dad's last instructions.
Of course.
I'll let you talk amongst yourselves.
I'll say hello.
I mean goodbye.
I'm jetlagged.
See you soon.
I'll show you out.
How's your mother?
-Fine.
And little Sam?
-All fine.
Sorry, but it failed.
I did what I could, but they didn't want it.
Your son and daughter agreed, but... the notary was completely against it.
He said they're firing people at the moment and can't hire anyone.
Sit down.
The notary seemed to be in charge.
I did exactly what you said.
I never showed any surprise.
That notary's starting to surprise me.
Really?
I was also surprised... but I didn't show it.
What are you doing there?
I haven't been able to explain everything.
When I dined with Sam Lion in New-York, just before his departure... he gave me the letter of recommendation... and also a suitcase with important documents.
He made a last minute decision not to take it with him.
Check his face to see how he takes that information.
If he seems worried, you're on the right track.
Keep going.
One of those documents is a copy of his last will.
Some manipulation seems to have occurred between... what the document says and the beneficiaries.
When he starts thinking and becomes curious... he'll no doubt continue the conversation himself.
I'm listening.
This is my proposition...
You do everything I say... or I'll show the documents to the parties involved.
He won't speak for a long time.
Then he'll say those documents are false and you're blackmailing him... that you're a fraud.
-You want to blackmail me.
Those papers must be false.
-Perfect...
Then you stay silent even longer.
Keep looking him in the eye... without blinking and without showing any surprise.
That way you'll scare him.
It's all in the eyes, And then you'll say:
Then the children will have to choose between a blackmailer and a crook.
You'll see him regain some hope.
And he'll try something else.
A blackmailer and a crook...
may go well together.
If he wants to collaborate, that's it.
Don't say anything but look... the way Elliott Ness looked when Al Capone wanted to bribe him... and wait until he bows his head.
Maybe he'll raise his head for a moment like a floored boxer.
Look him in the eye.
And then knock him out.
He seems like a fine man.
A great man.
Your father really wanted him.
A rara avis.
If he sings as well as he looks... it would be stupid not to use him.
What do you think?
When I saw the letter, I agreed right away.
And since I wanted to slow down a bit, this is the moment.
Never hint at the notary's embezzling.
This is an impressive office.
Can I look around?
Treat Jean-Philippe very carefully.
Dad must have told you about his love of the circus.
He wanted to turn his office into a circus museum.
Not very functional.
Never go against Jean-Philippe.
He has a passion for architecture.
He told me a lot about his passion for lions.
Yes, lions were his big passion.
What I hate about this type of architecture... is that there is no separation between the workers and the board.
That's the circus, the team spirit.
My father always said: a boss has to be able to see what the personnel are doing.
and the personnel always have to know where the boss is.
He's got a point.
-But it's impractical.
Yes, you're right.
Then you'll be assigned an office.
When you're alone, call me.
If he asks where you live...
Where do you live?
-Since I came back from Canada...
I've been staying with my dad, outside of Paris.
It's quiet.
Telephone.
-I'll take it there.
Here, you do it.
Ask for the balance sheets of the past three years... with all the corresponding documents.
Or else you won't make any decision.
Bring them tonight.
It went fine with your son.
Better than with your daughter.
A list of urgent things.
Give it to my secretary.
When I call and you can't speak, cough.
Always ask for time to think.
Bring your portable phone.
You have to explain this.
-We've got all night.
Did you ask my secretary to find you a room?
-Yes.
Did you discuss your salary?
-Yes, I told them what you told me.
I keep saying to Jean-Philippe that we'll discuss it later.
About my son...
It's normal that he's nice to you.
He's always nice to young people.
By the way, tell your father not to eavesdrop.
Or ask him to help us.
Can we get some too?
Telephone.
Are you available for dinner tonight?
Such a smart computer can't be wrong.
Ask for a printed copy.
We have to be on top of this.
Take your time.
I'm busy.
That gives me an excuse not to go tonight.
I'm coming over.
Am I interrupting?
-Not at all.
Come in.
My mother wants to meet you.
She's inviting you to dinner.
I'd love to, thanks.
Is tonight alright?
Tonight's difficult, because there's a problem in South America.
I have to see him...
I have to read all the files.
I'll see if I can cancel my dinner.
Have a seat.
I'll be right back.
Anything wrong?
-No, I'm going with Jean-Philippe.
Dad's hat?
-I'm always wearing it.
How's mum?
-She's nostalgic.
That's her.
-I know.
I couldn't cancel the dinner.
So I can't tonight.
But some time next week's fine.
-We'll do that then.
I also wanted to thank you for everything you're doing for us.
It's nothing special.
Dad would be very jealous if he saw you.
I understand he liked you.
-You're impressive too.
You still dress the same way.
How do you know?
-I know all about you.
He tells me things every day.
Told me.
He told me about you each night.
You're a bit like him.
-Do you think?
Not physically... but your attitude, your boldness.
The way you greet people, how calm you are, things like that.
Have a seat.
I'll try one more time to cancel my dinner.
I'll be right back.
Do I have to continue to pretend?
-When I say no, it's no.
They keep talking about you.
You're still important in their lives.
That's why I left.
Do you still not understand?
I noticed that your daughter... is a bit like you.
You should really consider going back to them.
If I wanted that, I wouldn't go through all this trouble.
They're not biting today.
-We're not forced to fish either.
Alright, I'll go.
You spend lots of money on unnecessary things.
And you don't keep check of your expenses, That's not good.
And the way you chase the personnel.
I'm embarrassed.
Is that all?
-No.
Al's fed up with the hotel and wants to live in dad's caravan.
Can I come in?
-Make yourself at home.
This is your house now.
Not very nice, this close to work.
Didn't your dad like it?
-Yes, but he loved the circus.
Don't you?
-No, I hate it.
I'm surprised.
Your sister loves it, I believe.
Yes, she does.
Is it on tonight?
Tonight?
Oh, tonight.
I wanted to say I'm happy about how we work together.
We're a very good team.
It seems best to me to keep it strictly business.
I'm here, Jean-Philippe.
Oh, is it you?
-I wanted to know if you're alright.
This is a very luxurious caravan.
I'm very grateful.
I'll be off then.
What do you think of him?
-Strapping.
I like blacks who are really black.
He is.
We're in a very difficult situation.
Goal.
Yes, goal.
You're kidding me.
There are some bad things happening here.
You're having fun, but I'm not having fun with your computers.
This is a misunderstanding.
It's not my birthday today.
This is because you've been with us for a year.
That's nice of you.
Shall I blow the candle?
There's something else.
-Where are we going?
With a birthday comes a present.
Dad loves old-timers.
We want to give you one.
-You can't.
Choose one.
No, you can't.
-Yes.
You love those cars.
I can't accept it.
I couldn't choose anyway.
They're all beautiful.
I wouldn't know.
I'll just pick the closest one.
I'm speechless.
-Dad once put it very well:
Never give someone a present that you don't love yourself.
I'm driving a car that used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson.
Unbelievable.
I'd like to have lunch together.
I'd rather have dinner with you.
-That's alright too.
I'll introduce you to someone who might become important to me.
Since you've taken over dad's role, I want to hear your opinion.
Are you planning on getting married?
-Yes, if he agrees.
If he agrees?
Why not?
I don't know who it is.
She'll introduce me to him.
It's simple: if he's ok, you approve.
And if not, I reject him?
-Of course.
Talking about marriage.
Céline's getting married today.
A beautiful car, isn't it?
Beautiful family.
-Yes, they're nice.
Is something wrong?
Family makes you think of family.
-That's true.
But why do you say that?
I'd like to see them again.
Just once.
Once.
How did you end up here?
I was here for work and I was almost out of petrol.
I saw this petrol station attendant who looks just like your dad.
Everyone has a double.
-Exactly.
He's not a real copy of your father, of course.
That's a nice ride.
Perfect.
Where's the hole?
It's well hidden.
They don't make them like this anymore.
-It's from'57-'58.
It used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson, the boxer.
You had La Motta and Dauthuille.
I remember Dauthuille well.
Graziano was the world champion.
He never gave up.
Always attacked.
Bang, and down.
I've seen Robinson box against Big Man.
Ray was good... and he had a good left hook... but he didn't cut it.
Not enough stamina.
Striking, isn't it?
-Yes, unbelievable.
He doesn't really look like him, but it's how he acts.
And Max Schmeling... he was very fast.
The way he'd come back with a left hook.
He was younger.
But he'd look a bit like this now.
Did anyone ever tell you, you look a lot like Sam Lion?
How's that?
-Sam Lion.
What weight category?
-No, a business man.
A business man?
Me?
No, kid.
That's full again.
That's 400 francs.
Yes, it's a guzzler.
500, I have to change that.
-No, never mind.
Well, thanks.
You're as generous as Robinson.
Could you do the windscreen?
-Of course, that's part of the job.
For that money, I'd polish your shoes.
That lady has beautiful eyes.
One moment.
If you're in a hurry, do it yourself.
It's true...
strong as a bear.
I don't mean it in a bad way... but I get the impression your fiancé's not very polite.
He's always very punctual.
There are always exceptions to the rule.
He's also very special.
Wait, this is wrong.
You're influencing the jury.
I'll admit it.
I tricked you.
He's been here for a while.
He was exactly on time.
Is he in the restaurant?
At this table even.
What's that?
-He's at this table.
Do you mean that...
-Yes.
Am I dreaming or do you really want to marry me?
Only if you agree.
Careful, I might say yes.
Say yes then.
I can't.
I'd want to but...
I have to make a phone call...
right away.
I have to tell my dad.
I'm very happy.
I don't show it, because I'm surprised.
But I'm very happy.
Mr Duvivier.
-That's me.
Will you accept my daughter as your daughter-in-law?
Why do you say that?
You're son's having dinner with my daughter and she's proposing to him.
Your daughter?
-Yes.
And your son's about to call me and ask my permission.
And you want my permission?
Is your daughter a serious girl?
Your daughter was going to introduce me to her fiancé tonight.
The problem is that I'm the fiancé.
You're both adults, so do what you want.
Aren't you surprised?
-Of course, I'm surprised.
Very surprised even.
And I only have one daughter.
Alright.
Talk to you later.
Do you know where she went?
-Maybe to the ladies.
I'll close.
What are you doing here?
-And you?
That's my hat.
Are you alone?
Where's Victoria?
-I thought she'd be here.
Isn't she here?
-No.
Weren't you having dinner together?
Yes, we had started.
Didn't she ask you to marry her?
-Yes, You knew about it?
Everyone did.
-I only heard about it tonight.
It's crazy.
I've always been a bit crazy.
And you live here?
-Yes, it's a bit like a circus.
And you let me marry a clown?
Don't you like him?
-Yes.
I liked him for what you made him do.
-What he did was the hardest thing.
And you didn't make a mistake.
Did you have fun the past two years?
That's hard with so many memories.
-Why then?
I wanted to take a shortcut, but I got lost.
What do we do now?
-Find him quickly.
And call me.
Where is she?
-She left again.
Can I talk to you?
-Go ahead.
No, not here.
Not here anymore.
Was this it?
-Yes.
Are you sure?
-Yes.
Now she knows.
-Listen.
I'm not listening.
I'll get worked up when I want.
It's over.
Finished.
Now I want to say something.
You listen to me for a change.
Do you know what you are?
A spoiled child that breaks its toys.
Your wives... your children, your company.
And now you're destroying me, but you won't succeed.
You taught me to be strong.
What are you thinking?
That you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion?
Come on.
Do you think you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion?
He's learning fast.
-He's getting there.
He's doing well.
Dad, it's me.
He's not in the caravan, not in the office.
He's nowhere.
He'll be back.
In a bad mood, but he'll be back.
Call me when he arrives.
Talk to you later.
Some days, I don't understand...
Shall we have a drink?
He's still not here.
I was in the caravan all this time.
He'll be there.
-It's almost five.
Did you call him in his car?
Do that and call me back.
Don't talk to anyone.
-I promise.
Bye.
I love you, dad.
Where's that asshole?
Al, what are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm in Thoiry.
The African part.
I want to ask you a very important question.
He called.
He arrived.
Do you think we can make him come back one day?
He gave me this, just before he left.
He always carried this with him.
LOOK AFTER HIM.
I BEG YOU.
LOOK AFTER HIM.
I BEG YOU.
-He's at his final destination now.
Did your father say that?
-Yes.
Sam we're going home.
Get up, mummy.
We won't get separated anymore.
Do I have to run you over?
See you tomorrow.
when Isabel sleeps nothing moves when Isabelle sleeps in her cradle of joy
do you know that she pilfers, the little scoundrel the oases of the Sahara the golden fish of China and the gardens of the Alhambra?
when Isabelle sleeps nothing moves when Isabelle sleeps in her cradle of joy
she robs the dreams and the games of a rose and a butter cup to put them in her eyes beautiful Isabelle, when she sleeps
when Isabelle laughs nothing moves when Isabelle laughs in her cradle of joy
do you know that she robs, the little mean one the laughter of the wild cascades which serve as a purse to kings without a retinue?
when Isabelle laughs nothing moves when Isabelle laughs in her cradle of joy
she robs the windows of their gold opening onto paradise to put it into her heart beautiful Isabelle, when she laughs
when Isabelle sings nothing moves when Isabelle sings in her cradle of joy
do you know that she robs the lace spun in the heart of nightingales and the kisses which umbrellas keep from taking flight?
when Isabelle laughs nothing moves when Isabelle laughs in her cradle of joy
She robs the velvet and the silk which the guitar yields to the Infanta to put them into her voice beautiful Isabelle, when she sings
Everyone is alone and no one cares about anyone
And our pains are a deserted island...
To Jacques Brel.
who will give a circus show for me nostalgic love in the dust who will make me go "I'm scared"
the knife in the heart, in the limelight who will treat me like a tigress the whip like a caress to the music who will make me balance between balloons full of pathos sometimes I panic
who will tell me words of love that can hurt who will hold me
ITINERARY OF A SPOILED CHILD when you'll release all the stars who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore
who will still make me dream the clown or the rider who emerges from the shadow who will still bring me the artist's performance the trapeze artist's show see him fall who will still bring me the child that plays
for the performing dogs or the vampires
Don't you have a ticket?
Where's your mother?
Where?
In the bar?
Wait, I'll check.
This boy says his mother's in the bar.
Could you have a look?
Ask for the mother of the boy.
Wait a moment.
What's your name?
Sam?
What have you got there?
Can I have a look?
Is that your mother's?
Sam's three years old.
I can't keep him.
I'm desperate.
Look after him.
I beg you.
three years later
Sam, 13 years old
Sam, 16 years old
it has a silver shine the itinerary of a spoiled child is littered with broken toys
the itinerary of a spoiled child
The last time I saw him, was just before he left.
He wanted to get to know himself.
This solitary voyage was a challenge he added to all the storms in his life.
He always said: when I spend some hours with you, I want to believe.
When I spend an evening with my children, I want to believe in family.
When I'm with a woman, I want to believe in love.
That's Sam Lion for you.
You know why he was called that, don't you?
He was found near a circus and when he was registered... the circus master called him Sam Lion because he was always near the lions.
This is the best day of my life.
-Because it's beautiful here.
Where does all this water go?
-To Lake Kariba.
It's beautiful.
Rainbows come straight out of the water.
The most beautiful spot in the world.
Will we see all of that?
You and I?
Look a rainbow.
Quick.
Make a wish.
When he falls from the trapeze, he becomes a street sweeper... so he can stay with the carnival.
He wins a prize for best sweeper and gets the award from Yvette... who becomes his wife.
They have a son, Jean-Philippe.
Then the big drama happens in Singapore.
He has to raise Jean-Philippe on his own.
It takes him ten years to recover and meet Corine.
Ten years to turn his little business into an international company.
Ten years before he can smile again upon seeing a child's face.
Magnificent.
You look more and more like your mother.
-Then you must be starting to hate me.
Whose idea was it to go here?
-Mine.
I wanted to go to Venice, but Corine had already been there.
Then I realised they have even more water here.
Who decided to call me Victoria?
-Your mother.
She's sure you were conceived here.
In this area.
I'm glad it wasn't near the Niagara Falls.
You were almost called Isabelle.
Because I loved Jacques Brels song.
It's about his daughter.
But because of this spectacle, you became Victoria.
How did you get the business?
After my accident, I was responsible for keeping the circus clean.
I looked for machines to do the work.
What shall we do tonight?
American dinner, tamtam, birthday cake, champagne.
The good life.
Doesn't that give you ideas?
-Why not?
I watched them this morning.
It's great what they do.
Look, he's the best one.
Unbelievable what he does.
Imagine, autumn on the Champs-Elysées.
'Ballet with Brooms'.
When will the machines be introduced?
-In a month.
How did you get the idea?
My daughter and I saw them on our travels and we improved on them.
They say a minister is interested in buying them.
That makes sense.
It's of interest to the public.
Are you really going to buy a circus that has gone bankrupt?
I love the circus, but that's nonsense.
I only hired people who were about to be fired.
This is my secretary, by the way.
The only secretary to land safely after a death-defying leap.
Most of the time.
How did you become the biggest in your trade, in 10 years?
Step in the shit often and always clean it up.
So this machine will replace street sweepers?
This machine can clean 10 kilometres per day.
A person can do 1 kilometre.
The operator can also use the machine as a mode of transport.
But most of all, the operator doesn't make contact with the garbage anymore.
The work will get a better reputation and will also be performed by students.
So, sweepers will be unemployed.
The machine can't reach everywhere and traditional sweepers are still required.
But they should learn to use roller-skates.
Do you find this funny?
-Not at all.
I need to talk to you.
-I understand.
What do you mean?
-I'm just saying I understand.
I don't want to go to the hotel.
It's not a hotel, it's where I live.
It's also about the rest.
What?
I don't have anything.
This machine's my first moped.
What do you want?
What do I have to do to keep you?
Drive a pink Cadillac?
Wait a moment.
Wait.
Here, this is for you.
What is it?
-Have a look.
I'd like to take you there.
Near Victoria Falls.
Are you going?
Alright.
Can I keep this?
-It's a present.
Will you be roller-skating for long?
-I don't know.
Aren't you taking that thing?
-Leave it.
I'll take it tomorrow.
When will you get married?
-Ask him.
Miss, bring me the file of Albert Duvivier.
It's a machine to pick up shit with, not girls.
And how often have I told you to wear your helmet?
Can I speak to the boss?
-I'm your direct superior.
I want to speak to whoever makes the rules, not to who enforces them.
Can you swim?
-Breast stroke.
Swim into the Atlantic Ocean and you might see him.
Damn.
That's not clear.
Repeat, please.
-Your position, Victoria?
I repeat 42 North, 26 West.
Still the same.
Speak clearly, dear.
I ask him to call you.
-In an hour.
I have things to do.
End of call.
-Fine.
So that's 42 North...
That's not my position at all.
Hello, Saint-Lys.
Is there anybody at the pump?
-Céline.
I'm here.
What do I have to do?
-Help them with the crossing.
How long will that take?
-Two weeks.
Will I be washing dishes for two weeks?
Victoria Lion Starting Point
I'll summarize.
Take it easy with the pills.
What's more important...
Are you listening?
Take your boat out mornings, afternoons and evenings... and get far away from us, for at least a month.
You can't quit smoking like that either.
Want to bet?
Is it that serious?
-It's in your head.
That's good.
I'll see you at dinner.
Are you still with Martine?
-I'll tell you later.
Jean-Philippe, your father's not doing well.
I fear a nervous breakdown.
He shouldn't continue to live close to his work.
It's not good to live in a caravan, especially for him.
I'll give him a prescription, but talk to him.
We have to get through to him.
Is he doing that bad?
What is happiness then?
-You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
Well, happiness is... it's...
When there is no trouble.
And you have to keep it that way.
You must be very tired to talk like that.
What tired you out the most in life?
Your mother.
Didn't you love her a bit?
-Yes.
Or you wouldn't have been born.
And did you love Jean-Philippe's mother?
Can't we talk about something else?
-You don't want to talk about anyone.
Are you angry with me?
I'm glad you still look human.
You should see the car.
Can you explain to me why we don't get along, dad?
I've sent you to schools that were too good.
While we both run Victoria, I can't be myself.
Hold on a bit longer.
I won't stay for long.
That's not what I mean.
You sleep at Victoria, you eat it, you drink it.
You sail Victoria.
It's all you think about.
We never have time to talk.
To spend an evening together.
Do you really want to cross the ocean?
-I've been sailing for 30 years.
The bay of St. Tropez isn't the same thing.
Anything urgent?
I'm not available for anyone.
You can't do this.
Can't I go out on the ocean?
-You're abandoning 12,000 employees.
No, I'm not.
I'm selling a company.
Quite a company.
You can't.
You are the company.
Who can buy a company like that?
-What about these walls?
What will you do with the money?
-I haven't had a break for 50 years.
Two days of holiday and you'll go mad.
-I want to try.
The doctor said he won't start again.
-What should I do?
Look.
-What should I do?
Ride a bicycle.
Look at him.
He goes from one to the next.
Look.
I want to write a book.
Think I can?
-A book?
Why not?
And I want to go to the US.
-Is he American?
Unbelievable.
You always take me to the circus.
-Of course.
My two big passions in life.
When I was young, I always wanted to marry you.
And now?
-I'd be too scared you'd leave me.
But I do want someone like you.
Shall I tell you something?
I'm not a good catch.
I don't believe that.
-It's true.
What's a good catch?
-Someone who doesn't think too much.
That only leaves the idiots.
-Don't believe that.
Better late than never.
You're even late on the day of your divorce.
Especially then.
Don't they know what the party's for?
-I was waiting for you.
Is this a joke?
-Don't pull that face.
It's a party.
You should celebrate the day of escape, not the day of imprisonment.
Isn't she beautiful, my divorced wife?
You look good.
-So do you.
Will she be in time?
-I think so.
When did she decide to come back?
-The day before yesterday.
I knew she wouldn't like New-York.
She's too French.
What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Everything's fine.
Look, there she is.
What has she got in her arms?
-She'll explain later.
You explain it to me.
-He's six months old and his name's Sam.
His name's Sam, he's six months old and I'm the grandfather.
Is that right?
Where's the father?
Not here.
Of course.
Does the father know, at least?
It's better like this.
Do you want to know what I really think?
I'm the happiest man in the world.
Look, he's got my eyes.
Not because she's my daughter, but it's great.
I would love it if you could publish it.
If there's a problem, you know where to find me.
Don't tell my daughter, please.
What are you doing here?
-Your pills.
Those pills.
They're alright, it's the rest.
Everything goes wrong.
Wait.
I told you to be here before the personnel.
What's this?
Do you call this advertising?
Everything you do, I have to do again.
Did they pay?
Good, I'll call you back right away.
We'll see each other tonight.
Did you read your sister's book?
-What's it about then?
A 25 year old girl falls in love with a 50 year old man.
He's a bit like you.
-And then?
He gives everything up to go with her.
That's why it's called 'Starting Point'.
How are you?
-Excellent.
I can't hear you well.
-Excellent!
Are you coming back soon?
-Not really.
We're all coming to the harbour.
And my son?
-We haven't seen him much.
When will you be back?
-In a couple of days.
Why?
Are there problems?
Not really, but we have to make some decisions.
Well, take them.
Hello?
I can't hear you anymore.
Hello?
I can't hear anything anymore.
Finished.
Is this really it?
-Yes.
How can I reach you?
-I'll write when I get there.
It's far away, isn't it?
-Yes, it's Africa.
Where is it exactly?
-I don't know yet.
I'll find out.
What can I say?
If it fails, I'll be here.
I know.
You're always here.
Alright, dad.
Take care.
Goodbye.
It's in a hurry.
who will give a circus show for me nostalgic love in the dust
who will make me go "I'm scared"
the knife in the heart, in the limelight who will treat me like a tigress the whip like a caress to music who will make me balance between balloons full of pathos sometimes I panic
who will tell me words of love that can hurt
-Good morning.
who will hold me when you'll release all the stars
who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore
who will still make me cry the clown or the rider who emerges from the shadow who will still bring me the artist's performance the trapeze artist's show see him fall who will still bring me the child that plays
for the performing dogs or the vampires who will do the final act for me to seduce me to smile
who will tell me words of love that can hurt who will hold me when you'll release all the stars
who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore
Remember what you told me last week?
-Last week I was tired.
As far as eating, drinking and fucking are concerned, animals do better than we.
You're talking like a spoiled child.
Animals die of heart attacks too.
What about priests and heart attacks?
What reunites us here is his love of others.
Many of us know that he didn't need much reason to come to our help.
I've often heard him complain about the company and talk about selling... but then he'd think of all of you and nothing changed.
Victoria and Jean-Philippe, you now have to survive this storm.
He once told me... if you love sun, rain and wind, you have to believe in God.
Let's pray for the days that he did believe.
Do you really speak French?
-If you want to talk to us, yes.
A taxi driver told me this was the place to go in Hamburg.
It's 300 marks for an hour, 1000 marks for a night... and free if you marry me.
I need false papers.
You'd have to go to granny.
She has the most contacts.
Careful, there's a lot of police here.
-I didn't do anything.
What's your speciality?
-Anything, if you pay.
Did granny explain?
I don't make papers, I find them.
-That's better.
With the Cologne Carnival approaching, it won't take very long.
Is Cologne far?
-400 kilometres.
Is it nice?
-It's special.
Want to know why I do this work?
You don't want to talk?
When you ask someone how they are, you take a big risk.
Don't you like me?
My daughter's your age.
I don't know anyone who loves the carnival this much.
Me neither.
Will you really use those 20 tickets?
-I have nothing else to do.
Well done.
Have you got work?
-Not really.
Come.
Come.
Mr Van den Berghe, architect.
50,000 dollars for one hour.
What do I have to do?
Deliver three bags at Düsseldorf Station.
Three bags?
It's only the two of them.
I'm sorry.
I always work alone.
Your passport, please.
I see you also fly to New-York.
Cancel Tokyo.
Tokyo?
-Cancel it.
Do you also fly to Papeete?
-Cancel New-York.
Give me Papeete.
Papeete.
If you tell me what you're looking for, I might be able to help.
Good question.
First, I'll go for some sun.
It's the wet season there.
Where do they go when it rains?
Papeete after all then?
I only have smoking.
I'll start smoking again then.
Are you doing that bad?
Ladies and gentlemen, we're descending towards Papeete.
It's 39 degrees.
Tighten your seatbelts.
an island an island off the shore of hope where men would not be afraid and soft and calm like your mirror

Isn't that jacket warm?
-A bit.
Why do you wear it?
-To protect myself.
Do you believe that yourself?
It's because Yvette gave it to you in Singapore.
Where did you put the jacket, sir?
On my bag, when I bought my ticket to Papeete.
The car will come later.
This is a honeymoon.
When there won't be much of me left anymore
Stop, Yvette.
You were very sweet at the cemetery, yesterday.
I wanted to bring you flowers.
It was the first time I saw you cry.
Can I touch you?
How do you like Jean-Philippe?
-You're rather hard on him.
You didn't raise him.
Yvette.
Come back, damnit!
Where were you?
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
That happens with ghosts.
Careful, or I'll leave again.
A little kiss.
Smile.
Perfect.
you're successful in business and lucky in love you often change secretaries

Van den Berghe, Belgium.
Architect?
Are there many French here?
-The whole kitchen crew's French.
Where are you from?
-Belgium.
A Belgian beer.
With foam?
-Without.
Yes, that's better.
On holiday.
Victoria Falls?
It's beautiful.
I'll put something under the table-leg.
It's the humidity.
Where's my bungalow?
Which number?
Number 12.
I'll take you there.
You don't seem to need a guide?
-I've got a good map.
Nice to have a Frenchman here.
-A Belgian.
But you don't have a Belgian accent.
-I can produce one.
Tomorrow morning, the elephants might have breakfast with you.
Do you like animals?
-They're interesting.
This is Snow White's house.
There are lots of mosquito's here.
Will you stay for long?
Are you a cop or a barman?
I may have come across confused.
You look like an uncle of mine, but without a beard.
Here, thanks.
Dinner's at 7:30.
I'll go for a walk.
Alright.
Breakfast is at 6:30.
They're going for it.
I have nothing to eat.
Are you going with us?
Don't you have a guide?
Excuse me.
Hello.
-Hello, sir.
Early bird?
I've got the day off.
Did you take good pictures?
-Yes, you with the lions.
Any more?
-No.
What's that?
From when is this?
-It's been in the hotel for months.
Did you show it to anyone?
-No, no one.
Behind you.
Don't turn around.
It's your fault that I ended up here.
All this talk about Victoria.
I was one of the 12,000 employees.
You were looking for roller skaters and since I was good at it...
And then I got fired.
You fired me.
What's your name?
Albert Duvivier.
They call me Al.
You're not afraid of lions.
Or of you.
Journalists always exaggerate a bit.
It's a small world.
Nobody would believe me.
Who will you tell?
I'm just saying...
Good.
Don't you feel at ease?
Stop moving around I'm getting seasick.
Why did you do it?
Because I felt like it.
Wasn't business going well?
You know enough by now.
I can keep a secret.
It's more than a secret.
If you'd explain, at least I'd understand.
I left behind what I loved the most.
Do you understand that?
No.
What's your price?
No, I won't sell them, because...
Anyway, I don't have the photos anymore.
Be honest.
You wanted to blackmail me.
No, I wanted to sell them.
-And what do you call that?
Blackmail.
I changed my mind.
Why did you do that with the lion?
Do you ever toss a coin?
Do you ever play Russian roulette?
-No, I don't.
What shall I do?
Kill you or bribe you?
I'd prefer the first solution.
No, the second.
I really don't know what to do with you.
I don't know what to do with me either.
What's your price?
I have no price.
Like with the tip.
I won't tell anyone.
I'll work with you, if you like.
Sell everything and come here to study the lions.
You've never had 12,000 employees.
Is it true what the newspapers write?
There's something wrong.
People often go missing at sea to reappear years later.
Do you know of an island without telephone?
Just say you got a mast against your head... and have been suffering from amnesia.
Are you an author or a barman?
-I said it to help you.
Have you got any family?
My father and sister.
-What do they do?
They have a hotel.
Well...
There's hotels and hotels.
I can understand you wanted to abandon 12,000 employees.
I can also understand you wanted to abandon your wife or wives.
I can understand all that.
But I can't understand how you could abandon your children.
You're driving too fast, sir.
Where are we going?
Where?
-To my children.
'It would be a pleasure to work with you if you come back to France.
I'm asking you because of your youth, your talent and your success in Canada.
And also because I can see many similarities between you and me.
Our company needs a man like you.
I hope to welcome you soon.
Sam Lion. '
So you're the last person to see my father?
At least, I'm the last person to have dined with him.
How did you get to know him?
He contacted me because I had a similar company as he.
In Canada.
Montreal.
And why did you leave Canada?
I was homesick.
France will always be France.
Of course.
The letter, the handwriting...
It affects me.
And?
Once I brought up the circus, all doors opened up.
And Jean-Philippe?
-He asked when you wrote the letter.
Just before you sailed off, I said.
We had had dinner, just like you told me.
We talked business and just before you left, you gave me the letter.
Did you tell him the way you're telling me now?
Yes, but I was...
-More at ease.
Yes, completely at ease.
Did you understand why the company's doing so bad?
I tried to find out more.
He explained things to me, but it was very technical.
I don't think I completely understood him.
He talked about debts the company had when you died.
Debts?
Go away.
I'll explain.
We have to play it very safe.
Are you ready?
What do you mean, safe?
From now on, don't do or say anything without talking to me first.
Within half a year, you'll be a captain of industry.
You'll have to wear another suit.
Pinstripe suits are out.
Tomorrow, you'll get a room in the city.
In a fancy hotel.
Four stars.
But you have to learn to say hello.
-Excuse me?
Saying hello properly is one of the most important things in life.
It's half the job.
Say hello to me.
No, with conviction.
Say hello as if I'm ill.
Again.
Now, I feel you're more interested in me than in yourself.
People prefer that you talk about them, rather than about yourself.
Say hello again.
That wasn't good.
I noticed it.
You can feel it yourself now, right?
Can I smile?
-As long as it's with compassion.
Don't smile too hard.
You'll often be confronted with things you don't know.
Pretend you know them.
The best way to suggest you know everything... is to never show surprise.
Understood?
You often show surprise.
That's your weakness.
We'll do a test.
I'll say a few things and you can't look surprised.
Understood?
Concentrate.
Did you know your father used to get it on with the petrol station attendant?
I don't want to see surprise.
-Yes, but that...
You just can't show surprise.
Imagine your father with the petrol station attendant.
There you go again.
-Another example.
It's a gripping example.
-It is.
Concentrate.
You look like Jesus.
You're doing it again.
Can't I do anything?
-No, nothing.
Look into the distance.
-Absent-minded?
Not too much.
Nothing.
Yes?
-Go on then because I...
Now I see surprise because I'm not saying anything.
I'd be surprised.
I did exactly as you said.
I like you.
I don't know if...
-That's surprising.
Is this still part of the test or...
-Of course.
But you said...
-Don't let it surprise you.
Alright.
Are you religious?
I don't know.
To my son, you're deeply religious.
To my daughter, you're an atheist.
And to you?
-I only believe in mathematics.
We get what we deserve.
Do I deserve to be here with you?
I'm starting to think so.
There he is.
Say hello.
Coffee?
Did you sleep well?
You get used to it.
Look, nice and fresh.
Do you still want to give us a hand?
-Of course.
She'll show you around.
I'm going to the pump.
What did you do in Belgium?
-I was with the circus.
I love the circus.
-I was only a bookkeeper.
Will you stay for long?
-Until I get a work permit.
Has Alex left yet?
I hope he'll be successful for once.
You have to go and buy stuff.
We're out of things.
Did it use to look like that?
-Yes, we were almost in the woods.
I'm here for Mr Jean-Philippe Lion.
Mr Duvivier for you.
My sister, Victoria.
Mr Verne, our notary.
An old friend, who'll do the talking.
In which part of Canada were you?
The factories were up north.
The office was in Montreal.
Beautiful country.
Our company's about to be taken over.
You understand we can't hire you.
I'm prepared to accept a trial period.
At no expense.
That's very friendly.
But we have more problems, that we can't talk about.
Can I say something?
When you saw dad, was he alright?
Yes, he's fine.
Was fine.
-My sister asks because... when he left, he was very tired and depressed.
We even thought of suicide.
-Not at all.
Your father's... was in good shape... both physically and mentally.
So don't worry.
You don't agree to a trial period?
We do...
-No, Victoria.
I consider that letter to be dad's last instructions.
Of course.
I'll let you talk amongst yourselves.
I'll say hello.
I mean goodbye.
I'm jetlagged.
See you soon.
I'll show you out.
How's your mother?
-Fine.
And little Sam?
-All fine.
Sorry, but it failed.
I did what I could, but they didn't want it.
Your son and daughter agreed, but... the notary was completely against it.
He said they're firing people at the moment and can't hire anyone.
Sit down.
The notary seemed to be in charge.
I did exactly what you said.
I never showed any surprise.
That notary's starting to surprise me.
Really?
I was also surprised... but I didn't show it.
What are you doing there?
I haven't been able to explain everything.
When I dined with Sam Lion in New-York, just before his departure... he gave me the letter of recommendation... and also a suitcase with important documents.
He made a last minute decision not to take it with him.
Check his face to see how he takes that information.
If he seems worried, you're on the right track.
Keep going.
One of those documents is a copy of his last will.
Some manipulation seems to have occurred between... what the document says and the beneficiaries.
When he starts thinking and becomes curious... he'll no doubt continue the conversation himself.
I'm listening.
This is my proposition...
You do everything I say... or I'll show the documents to the parties involved.
He won't speak for a long time.
Then he'll say those documents are false and you're blackmailing him... that you're a fraud.
-You want to blackmail me.
Those papers must be false.
-Perfect...
Then you stay silent even longer.
Keep looking him in the eye... without blinking and without showing any surprise.
That way you'll scare him.
It's all in the eyes, And then you'll say:
Then the children will have to choose between a blackmailer and a crook.
You'll see him regain some hope.
And he'll try something else.
A blackmailer and a crook...
may go well together.
If he wants to collaborate, that's it.
Don't say anything but look... the way Elliott Ness looked when Al Capone wanted to bribe him... and wait until he bows his head.
Maybe he'll raise his head for a moment like a floored boxer.
Look him in the eye.
And then knock him out.
He seems like a fine man.
A great man.
Your father really wanted him.
A rara avis.
If he sings as well as he looks... it would be stupid not to use him.
What do you think?
When I saw the letter, I agreed right away.
And since I wanted to slow down a bit, this is the moment.
Never hint at the notary's embezzling.
This is an impressive office.
Can I look around?
Treat Jean-Philippe very carefully.
Dad must have told you about his love of the circus.
He wanted to turn his office into a circus museum.
Not very functional.
Never go against Jean-Philippe.
He has a passion for architecture.
He told me a lot about his passion for lions.
Yes, lions were his big passion.
What I hate about this type of architecture... is that there is no separation between the workers and the board.
That's the circus, the team spirit.
My father always said: a boss has to be able to see what the personnel are doing.
and the personnel always have to know where the boss is.
He's got a point.
-But it's impractical.
Yes, you're right.
Then you'll be assigned an office.
When you're alone, call me.
If he asks where you live...
Where do you live?
-Since I came back from Canada...
I've been staying with my dad, outside of Paris.
It's quiet.
Telephone.
-I'll take it there.
Here, you do it.
Ask for the balance sheets of the past three years... with all the corresponding documents.
Or else you won't make any decision.
Bring them tonight.
It went fine with your son.
Better than with your daughter.
A list of urgent things.
Give it to my secretary.
When I call and you can't speak, cough.
Always ask for time to think.
Bring your portable phone.
You have to explain this.
-We've got all night.
Did you ask my secretary to find you a room?
-Yes.
Did you discuss your salary?
-Yes, I told them what you told me.
I keep saying to Jean-Philippe that we'll discuss it later.
About my son...
It's normal that he's nice to you.
He's always nice to young people.
By the way, tell your father not to eavesdrop.
Or ask him to help us.
Can we get some too?
Telephone.
Are you available for dinner tonight?
Such a smart computer can't be wrong.
Ask for a printed copy.
We have to be on top of this.
Take your time.
I'm busy.
That gives me an excuse not to go tonight.
I'm coming over.
Am I interrupting?
-Not at all.
Come in.
My mother wants to meet you.
She's inviting you to dinner.
I'd love to, thanks.
Is tonight alright?
Tonight's difficult, because there's a problem in South America.
I have to see him...
I have to read all the files.
I'll see if I can cancel my dinner.
Have a seat.
I'll be right back.
Anything wrong?
-No, I'm going with Jean-Philippe.
Dad's hat?
-I'm always wearing it.
How's mum?
-She's nostalgic.
That's her.
-I know.
I couldn't cancel the dinner.
So I can't tonight.
But some time next week's fine.
-We'll do that then.
I also wanted to thank you for everything you're doing for us.
It's nothing special.
Dad would be very jealous if he saw you.
I understand he liked you.
-You're impressive too.
You still dress the same way.
How do you know?
-I know all about you.
He tells me things every day.
Told me.
He told me about you each night.
You're a bit like him.
-Do you think?
Not physically... but your attitude, your boldness.
The way you greet people, how calm you are, things like that.
Have a seat.
I'll try one more time to cancel my dinner.
I'll be right back.
Do I have to continue to pretend?
-When I say no, it's no.
They keep talking about you.
You're still important in their lives.
That's why I left.
Do you still not understand?
I noticed that your daughter... is a bit like you.
You should really consider going back to them.
If I wanted that, I wouldn't go through all this trouble.
They're not biting today.
-We're not forced to fish either.
Alright, I'll go.
You spend lots of money on unnecessary things.
And you don't keep check of your expenses, That's not good.
And the way you chase the personnel.
I'm embarrassed.
Is that all?
-No.
Al's fed up with the hotel and wants to live in dad's caravan.
Can I come in?
-Make yourself at home.
This is your house now.
Not very nice, this close to work.
Didn't your dad like it?
-Yes, but he loved the circus.
Don't you?
-No, I hate it.
I'm surprised.
Your sister loves it, I believe.
Yes, she does.
Is it on tonight?
Tonight?
Oh, tonight.
I wanted to say I'm happy about how we work together.
We're a very good team.
It seems best to me to keep it strictly business.
I'm here, Jean-Philippe.
Oh, is it you?
-I wanted to know if you're alright.
This is a very luxurious caravan.
I'm very grateful.
I'll be off then.
What do you think of him?
-Strapping.
I like blacks who are really black.
He is.
We're in a very difficult situation.
Goal.
Yes, goal.
You're kidding me.
There are some bad things happening here.
You're having fun, but I'm not having fun with your computers.
This is a misunderstanding.
It's not my birthday today.
This is because you've been with us for a year.
That's nice of you.
Shall I blow the candle?
There's something else.
-Where are we going?
With a birthday comes a present.
Dad loves old-timers.
We want to give you one.
-You can't.
Choose one.
No, you can't.
-Yes.
You love those cars.
I can't accept it.
I couldn't choose anyway.
They're all beautiful.
I wouldn't know.
I'll just pick the closest one.
I'm speechless.
-Dad once put it very well:
Never give someone a present that you don't love yourself.
I'm driving a car that used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson.
Unbelievable.
I'd like to have lunch together.
I'd rather have dinner with you.
-That's alright too.
I'll introduce you to someone who might become important to me.
Since you've taken over dad's role, I want to hear your opinion.
Are you planning on getting married?
-Yes, if he agrees.
If he agrees?
Why not?
I don't know who it is.
She'll introduce me to him.
It's simple: if he's ok, you approve.
And if not, I reject him?
-Of course.
Talking about marriage.
Céline's getting married today.
A beautiful car, isn't it?
Beautiful family.
-Yes, they're nice.
Is something wrong?
Family makes you think of family.
-That's true.
But why do you say that?
I'd like to see them again.
Just once.
Once.
How did you end up here?
I was here for work and I was almost out of petrol.
I saw this petrol station attendant who looks just like your dad.
Everyone has a double.
-Exactly.
He's not a real copy of your father, of course.
That's a nice ride.
Perfect.
Where's the hole?
It's well hidden.
They don't make them like this anymore.
-It's from'57-'58.
It used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson, the boxer.
You had La Motta and Dauthuille.
I remember Dauthuille well.
Graziano was the world champion.
He never gave up.
Always attacked.
Bang, and down.
I've seen Robinson box against Big Man.
Ray was good... and he had a good left hook... but he didn't cut it.
Not enough stamina.
Striking, isn't it?
-Yes, unbelievable.
He doesn't really look like him, but it's how he acts.
And Max Schmeling... he was very fast.
The way he'd come back with a left hook.
He was younger.
But he'd look a bit like this now.
Did anyone ever tell you, you look a lot like Sam Lion?
How's that?
-Sam Lion.
What weight category?
-No, a business man.
A business man?
Me?
No, kid.
That's full again.
That's 400 francs.
Yes, it's a guzzler.
500, I have to change that.
-No, never mind.
Well, thanks.
You're as generous as Robinson.
Could you do the windscreen?
-Of course, that's part of the job.
For that money, I'd polish your shoes.
That lady has beautiful eyes.
One moment.
If you're in a hurry, do it yourself.
It's true...
strong as a bear.
I don't mean it in a bad way... but I get the impression your fiancé's not very polite.
He's always very punctual.
There are always exceptions to the rule.
He's also very special.
Wait, this is wrong.
You're influencing the jury.
I'll admit it.
I tricked you.
He's been here for a while.
He was exactly on time.
Is he in the restaurant?
At this table even.
What's that?
-He's at this table.
Do you mean that...
-Yes.
Am I dreaming or do you really want to marry me?
Only if you agree.
Careful, I might say yes.
Say yes then.
I can't.
I'd want to but...
I have to make a phone call...
right away.
I have to tell my dad.
I'm very happy.
I don't show it, because I'm surprised.
But I'm very happy.
Mr Duvivier.
-That's me.
Will you accept my daughter as your daughter-in-law?
Why do you say that?
You're son's having dinner with my daughter and she's proposing to him.
Your daughter?
-Yes.
And your son's about to call me and ask my permission.
And you want my permission?
Is your daughter a serious girl?
Your daughter was going to introduce me to her fiancé tonight.
The problem is that I'm the fiancé.
You're both adults, so do what you want.
Aren't you surprised?
-Of course, I'm surprised.
Very surprised even.
And I only have one daughter.
Alright.
Talk to you later.
Do you know where she went?
-Maybe to the ladies.
I'll close.
What are you doing here?
-And you?
That's my hat.
Are you alone?
Where's Victoria?
-I thought she'd be here.
Isn't she here?
-No.
Weren't you having dinner together?
Yes, we had started.
Didn't she ask you to marry her?
-Yes, You knew about it?
Everyone did.
-I only heard about it tonight.
It's crazy.
I've always been a bit crazy.
And you live here?
-Yes, it's a bit like a circus.
And you let me marry a clown?
Don't you like him?
-Yes.
I liked him for what you made him do.
-What he did was the hardest thing.
And you didn't make a mistake.
Did you have fun the past two years?
That's hard with so many memories.
-Why then?
I wanted to take a shortcut, but I got lost.
What do we do now?
-Find him quickly.
And call me.
Where is she?
-She left again.
Can I talk to you?
-Go ahead.
No, not here.
Not here anymore.
Was this it?
-Yes.
Are you sure?
-Yes.
Now she knows.
-Listen.
I'm not listening.
I'll get worked up when I want.
It's over.
Finished.
Now I want to say something.
You listen to me for a change.
Do you know what you are?
A spoiled child that breaks its toys.
Your wives... your children, your company.
And now you're destroying me, but you won't succeed.
You taught me to be strong.
What are you thinking?
That you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion?
Come on.
Do you think you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion?
He's learning fast.
-He's getting there.
He's doing well.
Dad, it's me.
He's not in the caravan, not in the office.
He's nowhere.
He'll be back.
In a bad mood, but he'll be back.
Call me when he arrives.
Talk to you later.
Some days, I don't understand...
Shall we have a drink?
He's still not here.
I was in the caravan all this time.
He'll be there.
-It's almost five.
Did you call him in his car?
Do that and call me back.
Don't talk to anyone.
-I promise.
Bye.
I love you, dad.
Where's that asshole?
Al, what are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm in Thoiry.
The African part.
I want to ask you a very important question.
He called.
He arrived.
Do you think we can make him come back one day?
He gave me this, just before he left.
He always carried this with him.
LOOK AFTER HIM.
I BEG YOU.
LOOK AFTER HIM.
I BEG YOU.
-He's at his final destination now.
Did your father say that?
-Yes.
Sam we're going home.
Get up, mummy.
We won't get separated anymore.
Do I have to run you over?
See you tomorrow.

- I'm lookin' for lightning.
- Got ups.
Got downs.
Got smiles.
Got frowns.
Got smoke.
Got blow.
Take you anywhere you wanna go.
I only have big bills.
That's cool.
Got plenty of change.
Could you, uh, turn off that box?
I really hate rap music.
Sure, my man.
- Thank you, man.
Car 54, 1091 Central Park West and 63rd,
Car 54.
K.
Cuff him!
Cuff him!
Where the fuck are you goin'?
I'm gonna help that young man over there.
Fuck him!
Take care of this one first!
This one's dead!
Would you get the fuckin' handcuffs off him?
Hey, fuck you, goddamn it!
Take it easy, man.
Get him to the hospital!
Police officer Patrick O'Leary was shot late last night in Central Park.
The mayor and the police commissioner expressed their outrage at a press conference at the widow's house in Queens.
O' Leary was the fourth police officer slain in the line of...
Hi.
Baby, baby, baby.
Congratulations.
Gail, you beamed me up...
you beamed me up in the middle of my ecstasy.
Do you think it's a little early in the morning for heavy metal?
Listen, Gail...
Gail, honey.
Sweetie, I love ya, I'm gonna marry ya, but you're making me feel very old.
This is not heavy metal.
This is Hendrix.
Genius, maybe.
But this is definitely not heavy metal.
Okay.
Okay?
Why don't you open your present?
Present.
Right.
What's the occasion?
Huh!
Congratulations?
For what?
On your last week with Legal Aid.
Hey.
Groovy.
Beautiful.
Why don't you wear one of the new suits Daddy's guy made for you?
Just try it.
I don't know, Gail.
I don't think the Wall Street garb'll swing with the Rikers Island crowd, you know?
They'll take me for a pimp.
What does that make me?
The best.
What are you drinking?
Orange julius, homemade.
Want some?
No.
No, thanks.
Oh, I've gotta run.
I have to be at Bumble and Bumble in 45 minutes, so try the new suit.
Yeah.
Remember to call about the apartment.
You bet.
And, Roland, about that tie...
- Yeah?
What about it?
I like this tie.
So, Dalton, you're finally gonna bag it at Legal Aid, huh, pal?
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
What about the fight for the underprivileged, the homeless and destitute?
You know what I'm talkin' about.
The good fight, pal.
Pap and drivel, bud.
Just liberal pap for the multitudes.
Right.
Okay.
Let's do it.
Okay.
These I gotta prosecute.
These I'm willing to let cop a plea.
You take the whole package, I let these go for time served.
It's beautiful.
Yeah, man.
All right.
- Groovy
- This is not a going away party, Dalton.
- I can't live with that.
- Come on, home.
It's my last week in the jungle, then I'm finito.
- Buy the next six lunches too?
- No guts, no glory.
Oh, baby.
Dalton, I never figured you for this upwardly mobile bullshit, man.
- It is a sellout.
- Hey, blood, the substance of law in America lies... in keeping the money in this country out of the hands of the widows and orphans... and in the hands of the major insurance companies, who know best...
Who know best how to manage it.
Hey Susan.
Hi, Sean.
Hi.
Hi.
From the looks of you, I'd say you found your insurance company.
Yeah, uh, Wall Street.
Next week.
You don't exactly look like chopped liver yourself.
Thanks.
Well, once again, I see thatjustice is being served... for lunch.
Here.
You forgot this one.
- just your average, crack-deaiin' cop killer.
It's no big deal.
- But I haven't interviewed him yet.
Could be innocent.
Not bloody likely.
Still, I'm impressed you still care about minor details such as that.
I'll meet you over at the pier.
You got it.
I'll see you in court.
Little history there, pal?
Yeah.
The whole world, man.
What she mean, "See you in court"?
Probably talkin' about that cop killer you got in your hand, pal.
What are you sayin'?
She's a public defender in Brooklyn.
No, she's not.
No?
- She's the new assistant D.A.
- Come on.
Is that straight?
Tag 'em and bag 'em, man.
You're dead.
Alma, what's the haps, babe?
Okay wise guy.
Through the detector.
Alma, why do you torture me with this...
Empty your pockets.
It's the watch.
It's the watch.
It's always the watch, watch.
See?
You love me.
You know it.
Statutory rape.
Possession of a deadly weapon.
Possession and sale of cocaine.
Possession and sale of crack.
Possession and sale of crack, crack, crack.
This I've gotta hear.
Hey, Boesky!
My name isn't Boesky.
You want a condom with your lunch?
- A condom?
- Yeah.
The mayor says we gotta offer every convict a condom a day... along with counseling on safe sex.
I don't want a condom.
I want a condom.
- Thank you very much.
- Michael Jones, Roland Dalton.
I'm a lawyer from Legal Aid.
I've been appointed to represent you.
You've been charged with first-degree murder of an undercover narcotics police officer.
You know, you don't look too bad for a guy who's been shot.
Shit.
That guy used a .38, man.
A .38 couldn't kill a cockroach.
That's why I use a nine-mil.
Hit somebody with a nine, they don't get up.
Oh, yeah?
You used a nine-mil on this cop?
Yeah.
What's the pitch, Michael?
Are you not gonna tell me you didn't do it?
Ofcoursel did it.
I'm in the park selling' drugs.
White dude come up to me, pull out a gun, say, "Give me your money."
- So i shot him.
Self-defense.
- Michael, you want a lawyer or you want your mother?
'Cause she's the only fool that's gonna buy that bag of shit.
Hey, man, I done a lot of bad things, but I'm not stupid.
- I don't lie to my lawyer.
- Here we go.
- That dude was a blue jean cop, man.
- Blue jean cop?
Yeah.
Blue jean cop.
What are you sayin'?
You shot him 'cause you didn't like his pants?
Dude didn't even show me no badge, man.
I didn't know he was a cop till they booked my ass.
I thought he was a vigilante.
Had to defend myself.
Well, that little mistake may very well get your ass cooked.
Shit, man.
I work for somebody who pays his bills.
Crack.
You dig?
- I dig.
- This cop must've been trying to cut hisself a piece of my man's action.
Shit.
All he had to do was say so.
I'd have handed him my green, let him and my man work it out.
I don't steal no dust between N.C. and the pigs.
Who's N.C.?
Ohh, man, I didn't say that.
Mornin', Richie.
Mornin', Billy.
Hup.
Hey, babe, I'm white and can't fight.
Well, comin' up in the world, huh?
What's, uh...
What's the mortgage on this condo?
What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doin' here, man?
I'm brushing' my fuckin' teeth.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
How did you find me?
Your old lady.
She told me to tell you if you don't get your ass home and do the right thing, she's gonna pack up all your shit and ship it back to Rope and Ride or Bump and Grind... or whatever the hell the name it is of that hick town in Texas you come from.
- What else did she say?
- She said pick up the laundry.
Right.
See what you got to look forward to, Counselor?
Hows your fiancée?
Ehh, she doesn't like Jimi Hendrix.
- Who?
- Come on.
Let's get some chow.
My treat.
- Do I smell another shakedown?
- That's verdad gringo.
Nice tie.
I knew there was a reason I liked you.
Look at this, Marks.
I don't believe all this glass, man.
What is this shit?
Empty crack containers, Counselor.
Popcorn.
If you wanna know what the latest drug craze is, check out Uncle Billy's trash can.
Junkies come and go, but Billy's trash can is always there.
Right now it's full of that shit.
Speaking of that shit, tell me something.
What's a blue jean cop?
Where'd you hear that?
From a client.
Well, I'm strictly bargain basement:
Wranglers and Levi's.
You lost me.
Guys I bust, on the other hand, wear Sergio Valentes.
Richie, you wanna run this by me in English?
All right.
Take some cop, some average guy who never had a shot at a big bust in all his life.
Just goin' along, grinding' out his 27,500 a year.
All of a sudden he ends up on a narc squad.
One mustard.
One afternoon he busts some scumbag carrying a bagful of chemicals.
That bagful of chemicals is worth more than that cop's gonna make in 10 years.
Next day he's out shoppin' for designer jeans.
Lure of easy money.
Very hard to refuse.
What about this cop who got whacked in Central Park, O'Leary?
Was that the deal with him?
Why are you workin' up such a sweat about this?
Word is you're out of the game in another week.
Call me a creature of habit.
O'Leary.
What about him?
"What about him?" Oh, great.
Thanks.
Come on, Dalton.
Even if I knew the answer to that, I'm not gonna tell you.
Fuck, man.
I gotta find out what's goin' down here.
So look around.
Oh. "Look around." Great.
What?
Look.
Who?
What?
I'm gonna tell you somethin', Dalton.
Cops don't know shit about hidin' money.
Check out his house.
His house?
Okay.
It killed you to tell me that, didn't it?
The last of the big fuckin' spenders, man.
Great.
Double or nothin', Richie.
Straight up.
How come no designer jeans for you?
I just figured they were meant for girls with cute little asses... and guys with no balls.
Besides, I'm independently wealthy.
Oh, right.
I love what you did with the condo.
This ain't high school, Dalton.
These guys got guns and money and not a fuckin' thing to lose.
I appreciate the advice.
P.S. Who's N.C.?
You just don't fuckin' get it, do ya?
Just don't get it.
Don't fuck with these people.
Richie, I don't wanna fuck with 'em.
I just wanna dance.
Uh, Mrs. O'Leary, I'm involved with the people prosecuting the man who killed your husband.
I know this may not be the most appropriate time, but I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I may.
Come in.
I was just making some tea.
Would you like some?
Or something stronger?
I'll, uh, have whatever you're having.
Okay.
Where the hell is Marks?
Why isn't he with us?
He's downtown.
He's picking up the warrants.
He's gonna take the subway up here and meet us.
It's cool.
Don't worry.
I would never take a subway to this part of town.
What?
What are you talkin' about?
He's a cop.
He's got a gun.
Patrick O'Leary was a cop.
He had a gun.
This place is worse than Beirut.
What do you want from me, huh?
If you guys wouldn't mind, could I get out of this car before we get there?
I mean, you're supposed to be undercover, but even a blind man could tell you're cops.
If someone sees me with you, I'm dead meat.
Listen, Dipshit!
If somebody sees you with us, you are dead meat.
You know, they're gonna kill you, baby.
Cut your balls off, gouge your eyes out.
But it's gonna be over soon enough.
But if the information you've given us turns out to be bullshit, we're gonna put you in a cell with Big Leroy, a 350-pound bull nigger faggot.
And when you got out in five years maybe, you'll be able to look up your asshole and see the sky.
- Don't fuck with me.
- Stevie, Stevie.
Give me another cigarette, will ya?
Buy your own.
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- I really appreciate this.
You're quite...
quite welcome.
Where are your cans?
Are they in the garage?
Yeah.
Um, no.
Well, the garage is locked.
Just put it at the bottom of the stairs.
That's it.
This okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.
Bye.
Bye.
Thanks.
Ladies, put your bags on the conveyor.
And, gentlemen, let's see your green.
Good.
Now, one at a time, walk through the detector.
Welcome to Wonderland.
- Welcome.
- Whoa.
Listen.
You think that was real?
Did you hear those screams?
You can't fake that.
I think they really cut them up.
Please.
You gotta let me have some more.
You've got to.
You know the rules.
No credit.
Cash only.
But, uh, I don't have any more on me.
I'll pay you back.
I promise.
Mr. Carr decides things like that.
But I wouldn't advise it.
Please?
Tell the man your story.
Uh...
I gave them all my money.
But I need more.
For most, there's no other way but pay.
But for you, maybe there's another.
Here's Marks.
Let's go.
Dipshit, take off.
All right.
You ready to rock 'n' roll?
Yeah.
I'm ready.
Good.
You got them fuckin' warrants?
Yeah.
Shit.
All right.
Here's the deal.
These watches here are synchronized.
At exactly 11:11, you blow out the back, we'll blow in the front.
You see anything you like?
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Everybody freeze!
Move all of them out!
Come on!
Let's go!
Go!
Go!
Faster!
Okay.
Okay.
Over to the bar.
Go!
Go!
Get on the fuckin' wall.
Get up!
Why don't you take Mr. Nicky downtown?
We'll stay here, clean up, book the evidence.
Give me the toy.
Let's see how you dance, scale.
Because of the quantity of drugs seized and the defendant's prior record,
I'm going to set cash bail at one million dollars.
Objection!
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
You're the prosecutor, and you're objecting to one million dollars cash bail?
Yes, Your Honor.
It's not enough.
Miss Cantrell, it's 11:55 on a Friday night.
That's a lot of cash to come up with at this hour.
Nicky Carr can pull that amount out of his small change purse.
It's not enough to ensure that he'll appear for trial.
Objection overruled.
Mr. Rosen, do you have anything to say?
Yes, Your Honor.
My client will make bail.
Fuck.
- Evidence room.
- Hello.
Larry?
This is Margaret O'Leary.
Someone broke into the garage last night.
I think they saw Patrick's car.
Uh, thanks.
I'll get back to you on that.
Larry, I'm worried.
Can you talk now?
No.
I'll call you...
I'll call you later.
Just checkin' to see if the Nicky Carr evidence got booked in all right.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's there.
Good.
- A lot of cash, wasn't it?
- It was a lot of cash, but it wasn't "a lot" of cash.
Yeah.
Give me two of whatever he's having.
You want a quadruple boilermaker?
Yeah, and a Pepsi.
I hope you're not planning on driving home.
I got no plans, Richie.
But speaking' of driving', there's a brand-new, bright red, Porsche Cabriolet, turbo, stuck under a tarp in the back of O'Learys garage.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yep.
I don't know.
I just don't know, Richie.
Once upon a time, all I planned to do was play the tenor sax... forever.
That's it.
Villes-ville, man.
But my dad, everybody, said I was a sap.
No money in it.
So i go to law school, and I am here now.
Gone from that other place.
But I could play the tenor sax all day and all night.
Everything was possible, and I was very certain that at any minute...
I was going to meet the love of my life.
The love of your life?
Yeah.
I met the love of my life, only I killed her dog... before I had a chance to tell her.
Man, she was everything I ever wanted.
We met at "Shakespeare in the Park."
I told her i was a lawyer.
That line seemed to work for you.
Rained like hell that day.
Had an umbrella.
We went back to her apartment.
She went to the bathroom.
I sat on the couch.
She had this great big damn dog.
The dog had a ball, so i threw it.
The dog brought it back.
I threw it again... harder.
I'll never forget the sound of that dog's paws on the newly waxed floors.
How was I supposed to know she left the window open?
That dog fell 13 stories, landed on the top of a parked car.
I went over, leaned out the window, looked down, threw up and left.
Left.
Without ever telling' her she was the one.
Happy is the fleeting hope of youth.
Who said that?
Me.
I'm gonna take this case, Richie.
Good for you, Counselor.
Me too.
Hi.
I'm lookin' for a runner.
About this high, white, 135 pounds, brown hair.
Wears a little ponytail.
He was wearing a pair of gray pants and a flashy Kind of gray sweater... and a pair of felony fliers the night of the bust.
Hey, cop, what's your problem?
This place is legal now.
You lookin' for a cut, you gotta talk to your boys down at the station.
Yeah.
Get up.
- I said get up.
- Hey, cop, stop harassing' me before I call my lawyer.
You know what this is?
It's a gun.
It's a gun.
You're a fuckin' genius.
Now, listen to this.
This gun is clean.
No serial numbers.
So after I blow out what's left of your brains and chuck it in the East River, your case is closed.
People downtown are gonna file it under D.S.A.F.
"Did Society A Favor."
You got it?
I understand.
I understand.
Now, where is he?
Stevie's on the Deuce over at the New Amsterdam.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You said you wanted to go along for the ride.
- Yeah, man.
- The bus is leavin', amigo.
Okay.
Where?
New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street.
Thirty minutes.
I'm down.
Ira!
Hey.
Nice to see ya.
Whoa.
Wait a minute, Stevie.
Yeah.
This one looks real.
You bet your ass it's real.
Hey, Bob, I want you to change the sheets in the honeymoon suite.
This is what I got, and this is what I want.
Stevie.
Which room is he in?
You know how it is, Chief.
I don't think he wants to be disturbed right now.
Honeymoon suite.
He's in the honeymoon suite.
Oh.
Huh.
Shit.
Real, live girls, gentlemen.
Real, live girls.
Look at Bobbie in booth three, Melody in booth four... and Tamara in booth five.
These are real, live women...
live flesh.
Step into a booth.
Richie, Richie, look, I don't know what kind of party we're crashing' up here, but you don't happen to have a little somethin' for me, do ya, like a bazooka?
You know how to use one of these?
Fuckin' a bubba.
I'm from New York City.
Don't shoot me in the ass.
Holy shit.
Oh, yeah.
Police officer.
Freeze!
Hands up.
Get your goddamn hands up.
Anything you say, Officer.
Grab him!
You son of a bitch!
Hey!
You drive.
I'll shoot.
Stay back, motherfucker!
That's my house, you son of a bitch!
Get off!
Where you goin', Max?
Hey, Rydell.
Too bad about Dipshit, huh?
He gave us a lot of good tips.
Yeah, I'll bet he did.
What kind of shit you carryin'?
That ain't regulation.
It's the gun I own to exercise my constitutional right to bear arms.
Hey, ain't you something?
Big John Wayne fan, huh?
.45 Magnum.
Plan on taking down an army?
I don't know yet.
Right.
Sweetheart, I'm going to bed.
Okay.
Good night.
Did you call about the apartment?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I forgot.
I forgot all about it.
I've had all this work to do.
My ass still aches from that motorcycle.
I...
Roland, you promised. lf we don't call, we lose the apartment.
I know, Gail.
I know.
I'll call about the apartment tomorrow.
I just can't believe you're spending all this time trying to get this guy set free, and you can't find five minutes to do something that's really important for us.
This guy's a crack dealer.
He's a rapist.
People like him belong in jail.
- I can't believe you want him out.
- I don't necessarily want him out.
- I just don't want him in for something he didn't do.
- Who cares if he did it?
If he didn't do this, he damn sure did something else.
Who gives a fuck if he's innocent?
- Well, I do.
I give a fuck.
- For Christ's sake, this man sells death to schoolkids.
Gail.
Hey, hey, sweetie.
What's goin' on here, huh?
Come here.
Now, what's all this about, huh?
Is this some kind of panic that I'm gonna take a left turn on your dad's offer about his law firm?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Yeah?
I just don't understand your fascination with all this.
Hey, it's all in your mind.
I'll call about the apartment.
I promise.
I'll call tomorrow.
All right?
Okay.
And you love me, right?
I...
I love you.
A lot.
A lot.
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, one thing I promise not to do in this courtroom, is to pretend to you... that I am representing Snow White for a client.
The simple fact of the matter is that all the Seven Dwarfs couldn't match his record...
- on a weekend pass in Singapore.
I'm not going to conceal this fact from you, and I apologize to my humble colleague, the district attorney, for snatching that ham bone from her plate.
However, I do promise to use every means of persuasion I can muster... to prove to you that my client, Michael Jones, did not commit the crime of first-degree murder, but that he in fact shot Officer Patrick O'Leary in self-defense.
Humorous yet restrained.
Rhetorical yet substantive.
You managed to cover everything except the will of God.
I'm saving that for my closing.
I thought so.
You cleared for miracles?
Cecil B. DeMille would be proud.
I'm glad I have a front-row seat.
Okay.
What's the deal?
No deals today, buddy.
You missed that boat.
I'm taking your boy to the max.
I'm not talking about that deal.
I'm talking about this deal.
What gives?
What do you want from me?
Do I look like I want something?
Why don't you take your mind games... and run 'em by those dorks at the A.C.L.U., 'cause I don't have time for this bullshit.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Your star is rising in the financial arena.
Correct.
- Complete with Miss Right, I hear, too.
- Hey, look, Susan.
I loved you better than anybody's ever gonna love you in your lifetime, and you left me holding the bag.
You took a hike, remember?
Now, I can't figure it, but I pull myself together, I move on, and... boom... you show up here?
Well, look, I didn't ask for it and I didn't want it, so why don't we just sort of swing on through this with a minimum of bloodshed?
In case you didn't grasp that, I was crazy about you.
Isn't that your waking state?
Look, do me a favor, will ya?
just tell me so i can quit buggin' myself about it.
Just tell me why.
You were turning cynical and judgmental and berating and mean.
Oh?
You concocted some bullshit story about how credit cards were gonna save your life.
Why didn't you tell me that then?
I did... in my own way.
You just didn't hear it.
Oh.
I miss you, Roland.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what are we gonna do now?
Gentlemen, I got $10,000... that says the Harlem Shuflle gon' kick The Crackers ass.
Anybody want a piece, see the man.
All right?
Come on, baby.
Yo, yo, yo!
Whoo!
What we gon' do?
Win!
That's right!
Yeah!
Yeah!
We're gonna win, man!
Oh, shit.
Hold this, baby.
Rydell, you know, you could fuck up a wet dream.
Come on.
We gotta talk.
This is my play time.
Can I at least watch the race?
Sure.
I ain't here to give out parking tickets.
Let's get it on!
Shit.
Tough luck, Cracker.
Hey, get my money.
Now, what can I do for you?
- Richie Marks.
- What about him?
I see.
What's in it for me?
Evidence against you... in the police department safe, disappears.
A hundred and forty-seven thousand dollars... and seven pounds of cocaine... just disappears, from the police evidence safe, huh?
Won't be the first time.
I got your message.
You the new boy at the precinct.
You'll find out I always pay my bills.
But the people I work for are just a little pissed off.
What the fuck happened in Central Park?
A one-time, small-time mistake.
Ain't gonna happen again.
Fifty "K" a month, and midtown north is yours.
Don't be worryin' about no Michael Jones.
I'm gonna clean up that mess personally.
But you... are gonna have to take care of Richie Marks.
It's a deal.
You do your thing.
I'll take care of Marks pronto.
I forgot how much I love this room.
My tree house.
I forgot how much I love listening to you.
I forgot how much I love having you here.
You like to lie in bed and chitchat, don't you?
Except you do most of the talking.
Yeah, I do.
I gotta go..
I won't be your mistress, Dalton.
Well, I just can't not show up.
Make it easier for both of us.
This time it was what it was.
If there's a next time, you have to stay the whole night.
So I just put a bow on that package and present it to my fiancee?
That's up to you, my dear.
I said, does the defense have any questions?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Yes, Your Honor, we do.
We have some questions.
Uh, Officer Varelli, when you came upon the scene, you recognized the deceased to be a police officer.
- Is that right?
- Yes, I did.
In fact, you knew him to be an undercover police officer... investigating narcotics in your area, correct?
That's correct.
When you...
When you approached Officer O'Leary, he was lying on the ground unconscious.
Objection.
Conclusion.
Sustained.
Okay, uh, Officer Varelli, his eyes were closed?
Yes.
He was not moving?
No, he wasn't.
- It was dear to you that he was not in any semblance of mind...
Objection!
Conclusion.
Sustained.
Officer Varelli, when you arrived upon the scene, were there any other police officers in the proximity, except for your partner?
No.
To the best of your knowledge, isn't it correct police procedure... when an officer is going to make a narcotics arrest on the street... to have some sort of backup presence, some sort of assistance, some sort ofsupport or protection?
Usually that's the case.
Well, in your experience, don't you find it highly unusual, if an officer's gonna be engaged in the dangerous circumstances of a narcotics arrest, to be proceeding alone?
Objection!
Your Honor, this is conjecture.
What is usual for Officer Varelli may not be for someone else.
Patrick O'Leary was an undercover policeman.
What his particular procedure was, we do not know.
Sustained.
In any event, Officer Varelli, Officer O'Leary's partner never arrived, nor did anyone else resembling a human being... who claimed to have anyworkwith him.
- True?
- That's true.
So what you saw was, you saw a man lying on the ground who was shot.
But you did not actually see anyone do the shooting, did you?
Of course not.
I already said I wasn't there.
But it's obvious what happened.
No, I submit to you that it is not obvious what happened.
It is not obvious, but it is fair to say that you assumed what happened... because you were not there, Officer Varelli, and you did not see what happened.
Right.
I already said that.
Right.
And your assumption was that Patrick O'Leary, in the middle of a narcotics arrest, was shot by Michael Jones.
But since you were not there, you could assume anything.
You could assume, as a matter of fact, that maybe Patrick O'Leary shot himself.
Or maybe you could assume, because you were not there, that Patrick O'Leary did not identify himself as a police officer because his badge was not out, and you could assume, Officer Varelli, that Patrick O'Leary pulled his gun out first and shot Michael Jones,
Objection!
planning to kill him and steal his money and his drugs!
Objection!
Could you assume that, Officer Varelli?
Bullshit!
Mr. Dalton, you will please approach the bench.
Nice moves.
Dazzling, aren't I?
But what do you got after that, though?
Hang on tight, partner.
Oh, I see.
The ride gets rougher than this.
You betcha.
That's just the way I like it.
You'd better watch out.
I can roll with anything you put out, buddy.
Yeah, you're a regular bronc buster.
That's what's called a discreet turn of the phrase, right?
You got it, cowboy.
Well, I'm gonna brand you this time, horsie, so everybody knows you're mine.
How's that grab you?
Oh, yeah?
Where's your iron?
Tell her.
Can you handle this, or is this too real for you?
Yeah, I can handle it.
Just do me a favor, will ya?
Professional or personal?
Personal.
Done.
Whisper "yippee-yi-oh" in my ear.
Roland!
- Hi!
- Oh, hi, Gail.
How are you, doll?
Mr. Feinberger.
Roland.
Can you believe it?
I told Daddy we were having lunch, and he said that he was free and he'd join us.
Can you imagine Daddy being free for lunch?
I can't.
Let's do it.
Ow!
Come on.
Come on.
Oh!
God!
Attempted murder of a police officer.
That's gonna get your friend here three years in the joint.
What you gonna do?
Gonna go along with him, or you wanna assume the position... and let me bust you for loitering or some other bullshit charge?
I know what you're thinking.
You're young and fast, and I'm old and slow.
What are you gonna do, asshole?
Dumb fuckin' question.
Police officer!
- Everybody get down!
- Get down!
Get down!
Get outta my way!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back!
Fuck you, Marks!
No, actually, asshole, it's... fuck you.
Oh, Jesus.
Better get a shovel.
Wow.
Who's writing this report?
Yeah, yeah, Sorry.
Huh?
Good morning.
Yeah.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You want something to eat?
Yes, I want something to eat.
God, I love you.
I didn't tell her.
I lied to her, told her i was going to Boston.
And she believed you?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't she?
Sure.
Don't be so sure, Dalton.
Women aren't stupid.
I wanted to tell her.
I wanted to, but then her dad showed up for lunch.
Oh, so your guts dried up in the face of Daddy Warbucks.
Now, is this gonna be some kind of female territorial doo-wop?
- You know, you really piss me off.
- Here we go.
This isn't about me.
This is about you.
Yeah, I'm a woman, and I'm jealous.
So what?
This is about you... and who you are, and who you really wanna be.
You know, you really lose the best of yourself when you're around the gold.
Now here we are, one year ago, back in the high-jive self-realization riff.
So you're gonna take 14 years of Legal Aid and chuck it out the window.
You just don't get it, do you?
I mean, you got me as some kind of retrograde Clarence Darrow or something.
You just don't get it.
You keep thinking I'm leaving Legal Aid 'cause I wanna be somewhere else.
I'm outta here, babe, because it's kicking the life out of me.
See?
Day in and day fucking out... with the scumbags and the jerk-offs and the sex creeps... and the freaks and the killers.
Goddamn it!
I can't live in it anymore.
And God forbid I get somebody, just one somebody who's innocent and I can't prove it, so instead of risking a loss...
I gotta plea-bargain his ass so he doesn't do eight years of hard time... he ends up only doing one, in Attica with the rest of the human puke.
But that doesn't matter anyway, because after one year in that nightmare, his life is over.
And so what if I want things...
Susan?
People want shit, you know.
I want things!
I know.
Life's a bitch, huh, Roland?
Why do you think it's so goddamned manifest destiny for me... to be picking shit with the chickens the rest of my life?
Because you love it.
You love it to death.
And of everything you do, it's the thing you do best.
Now, Mr. Mastrangelo, you stated that you owned and operated... a reputable, honest exotic automobile business, right?
Yes, I did.
The Casa d'Oro Custom Car Emporium.
Correct?
That's right.
Sounds like a brothel in Tangiers.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
You also stated that Officer O'Leary purchased... a customized turbo Porsche Cabriolet.
Right.
And that he paid $87,300 for it?
Right.
How did he pay for it?
Cash.
He paid cash.
And did you give him a warranty?
- No.
- Did you give him a receipt?
No.
So, in fact, there is no record of this actual transaction.
We have some records.
But we recently moved locations and, uh, they got lost in the shuffle.
So you would just have this court take your word for it that this actually occurred.
- Well, it's the truth.
- And you would tell the truth because you're an honest and reputable man.
Objection, Your Honor.
The district attorney is obviously badgering and ridiculing this witness.
Overruled.
Isn't it a fact that on February 10, 1984, you were convicted of trafficking interstate stolen automobiles?
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Sustained.
Miss Cantrell.
No more questions.
Your Honor, at this time I would like to call as my last witness... the defendant, Michael Jones.
Will the defendant please rise... and approach the witness box.
Swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
For the record, state your full name, your occupation and where you live.
Michael Ezekial Jones.
I'm a drug dealer.
I live in Rikers Island Prison.
The witness may take the stand.
Michael Jones.
Michael Ezekial Jones.
Now, Michael, would you tell us, in your own words, exactly what happened to you on Friday night, October 9, approximately 10:00 p.m... in Central Park, near the west side 61st Street pedestrian tunnel.
I was selling drugs.
A white guy came up to me, asked to buy lightning'... the stuff you call crack.
I told him I had some.
He said he only had big bills.
I said I had plenty change.
He reached into his jacket, and instead of pulling out his wallet, he pulled out a gun.
He looked at me in my eye and said,
"Good-bye, nigger."
I thought he was gonna kill me.
I didn't know he was no cop.
I...
I went for my gun.
He fired, and I fired.
I remember gettin' hit.
I don't remember no more.
I, uh...
I was one of the first two cops to come upon the O'Leary death scene.
I'm the one that booked the evidence.
The black kid's ghetto blaster, when I found it, was in the "record" position.
Did you listen to the tape?
No.
I've heard rumors.
I don't even wanna know if they're true.
Why are you telling me this now?
One of the cops that got killed in Times Square by that scale you finally got... was my brother.
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen, if I give this information to the defense attorney?
A lot of brother officers are gonna go down in the investigation this thing causes.
Yeah, this is Police Officer Marks.
I got an emergency call for defense attorney Roland Dalton.
Mr. Jones, have you ever been arrested for selling crack before?
Yeah.
And when you were arrested was the officer wearing a uniform or street clothes?
Street clothes.
And also when you were arrested, did he pull out his badge and say, "Hello, I'm a police officer"?
Or did he try to buy some drugs and make a deal...
Your Honor, excuse me.
I request a personal emergency recess.
Your Honor, I object to this transparent ploy.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
I know it seems hideously contrived, except I request an emergency personal recess.
Well, it's 10 minutes of 4:00.
This court will recess until 9:00 tomorrow morning.
Excuse me...
Gail?
Oh, wait!
Hi!
Gail...
Hi.
Richie Marks is waiting for me.
He's got something...
I gotta talk to you about something.
I gotta talk to you.
There's something very important I have to tell you...
Wait.
I'm pregnant.
Isn't that great?
God!
Really?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well...
Well...
Gail...
Listen, this is great...
I threw up this morning.
You did?
Richie Marks is waiting for me with a thing...
Oh.
Okay.
Uh, no, sweetie, we'll...
Tonight.
Bye.
Come on.
Come on.
Get your hands off me.
Come on!
I'm just gonna get some candy!
Uh, Sergeant, my name is Roland Dalton.
I'm from Legal Aid.
I got a court order here giving me access to your evidence room.
Did you hear me?
Well, can you read?
This is a court order.
Up the fucking stairs!
Thanks.
Oh, no.
I'm gettin' out of here.
Come on.
It's over.
Come here.
Come here.
Hey.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Come back here.
Mr. Christian, sit down.
Come here.
Evidence Room.
Dalton's coming up.
All right.
Thanks.
Yo, I got a court order here... that grants me access to certain evidence in the Jones-O'Leary case.
This is a court order.
Dig?
Oh, Christ.
This is a shame.
My key just broke off in the lock.
It did?
Yeah.
Well, I don't suppose between you and the putz downstairs you got a pair of bolt cutters.
Well, Maintenance does, but they knock off at, uh, 5:00.
You have to come back in the morning.
In the morning.
Yeah.
Thanks.
You know, uh...
You cops, you're the best that money can buy.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
So, what were you looking for?
True love.
Isn't that what we're all looking for?
That's cute.
That's very cute.
So, you're a tough guy, huh?
What were you looking for?
I think I wish to speak to my lawyer.
Al Fallon of Legal Aid.
Just speak to my asshole, huh?
What were you looking for?
What the fuck are you doin'?
Shut the fuck up!
Let's play again.
You got lucky last time.
The tape.
Okay, the tape.
The tape.
What tape?
The tape...
M...
Michael Jones recorded everything on the tape recorder.
The tape's in the ghetto blaster.
Play the fucking tape.
What the fuck is that?
Thank you, man.
Good-bye, nigger.
Alright, don't get nervous.
I'm going downstairs to the fire alarm box.
When the bell goes off...
shoot him.
- I shoot him?
- Yeah.
His fingerprints are all over the bolt cutter and the evidence room locker.
I haven't got a clean gun.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
There are 245,000 of those police specials floating around New York City.
By the time they figure this shit out, we'll be long gone.
This your evidence?
Here's your evidence.
Well, hurry up and go pull the goddamn thing!
Just do it.
Where's Dalton?
Third floor, interrogation room.
He's waiting for his lawyer.
Hello, baby?
Daddy's coming home real soon.
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Oh!
Goddamn!
Oh, fuck!
Richie, get that tape!
The tape!
The tape!
Goddamn it, man, they...
How you cloing'?
They had the gun...
They had the gun at my head.
Court- I gotta get to...
Listen...
Listen...
Okay?
I gotta...
Court, man...
Goddamn it, what a world.
What a fucking world.
Do I know you?
Hey!
I recognize you from TV.
You're the guy defending the cop killer.
- Alleged cop killer.
Alleged.
- What, you mean he didn't do it?
- Yeah, man, he did it, but he did it in self-defense.
- Really?
Yeah, really.
- Hey they coming after you?
- Yep.
Yep.
They're coming after me.
Why?
Well, because a bad cop lied to 'em, and I know the truth.
And if they know I know the truth, a lot of bad cops are in deep fucking trouble.
So let's go to court.
Hey, I studied the constitution.
I passed my citizenship test.
You got a right to be at the court.
I'll get you to court.
You hold on.
Yeah?
Oh yeah?
Hey, fuck you!
Bring it up!
Yahoo!
Mr. Dalton!
What in hell is going on here?
Your Honor, I have a court order.
I have evidence that...
This tape is...
Police officers, don't...
It's vital you hear the truth...
Bailiff, bring Mr. Dalton to my chambers.
- Your Honor, I have to arrest him.
- On the street, you are the law.
But on the steps of this courthouse, I am the law.
If this police officer does not lower his gun, arrest him for obstructing justice.
Go ahead, white bread.
Make my day.
Judge Maynard, there's evidence on this tape...
Mr. Dalton!
The legal ramifications that would allow you to testify... about what you heard, or maybe didn't hear, on this tape... or even if this tape is, in fact, the tape that was in Michael Jones's radio at the time of the alleged incident...
I mean, it boggles the mind!
I cannot allow it to be introduced as evidence.
Now, Miss Cantrell... will complete her cross -examination, and then both of you will give your closing arguments.
And then I will give this case to the jury.
And, Mr. Dalton, if the jury should rule against you, you can exercise your right of appeal.
And that is that.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I'd like to... give you a few words from the book of Matthew, if I may... chapter 10, verses 26 and 27.
"There is nothing covered up that shall not be uncovered;
"There is nothing hidden that shall not be known.
"Whatever I say to you in the dark you must repeat in the daylight, and whatever is whispered you must shout from the rooftops."
Now, the truth... the truth ain't always pleasant.
But the truth, however, is... always the truth.
Now, the prosecution... would have you believe that this is just some simple, straightforward case... a bad man shoots down... a decorated police officer in the line ofduty... to avoid one more in a long series of endless arrests.
However, I say... that Officer Patrick O'Leary... was not working in the line of duty Friday night, October 9, and I say that Officer Patrick O'Leary made a lot of money... stealing from drug dealers.
And I also say that Patrick O'Leary, on Friday night, October 9, didn't even bother to identify himself to my client, Michael Jones.
If he had, he'd be alive today.
You've already heard Michael Jones acknowledge to you, admit, confess time and time again under cross-examination by the district attorney, that he considered it standard operating procedure, simply the cost of doing business, to pay off cops.
But Officer Patrick O'Leary pulled out his gun... before he pulled out his badge.
And my client, Michael Jones, thought he was some kind of nut.
Hey, so would I.
Wouldn't you?
And after being shot once, point-blank, by Patrick O'Leary.
My client, drug dealer or no, pulled out his own gun and fired in self-defense.
The prosecution's case rests on two points.
One...
Gotta cut me loose.
What?
C-Can't do the time.
Won't make it...
inside this go-round.
Can't do the time.
You can't do the time.
You can't do the time, Michael?
But you can take money from these 10-year-old kids and blow holes in their lives... with that poison you push?
Now you wanna cry on my shoulder 'cause you can't do the time?
Stand up.
Hey, man, chill out.
Stand up!
I'm standing!
You stand too!
Jury's back.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
Will the defendant please rise and face the jury.
Will the foreman read the verdict.
The jury finds the defendant... not guilty.
That's great, Mike.
See you in jail.
I dig these love notes in class, Richie.
What's the haps?
Carr and Rydell are headin' for the airport.
Wanna drive, or wanna shoot?
I'll drive, you shoot!
Hey, baby.
It's not forever.
I'll be back.
Besides, Costa Rica's just a puddle hop away.
Richie, this is O'Leary's wheels.
You copped O'Leary's car.
I didn't think he'd give a shit.
Come on!
Keep going!
So long, sucker.
- Jesus Christ!
- Losing hydraulics!
The landing gear won't retract!
Tower, this is 750-Alpha-Charlie!
Flame out.
Flame out, port engine.
Shut it down!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
LaGuardia Tower, we have to land!
- Roger.
- 750-Alpha-Charlie, come in.
LaGuardia Tower, transfer...
Richie, I love ya, pal, but you are definitely new to the planet.
Roland?
I have a confession to make.
What?
The rabbit.
It never died.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want to lose you.
Everyone, there's something I need to tell you.
I lost the baby.
I'm not pregnant anymore.
Oh, Gail, I...
it's okay.
I really don't even want to talk about it.
Besides, we have loads of time for children.
And now I'm not gonna have to buy that larger wedding dress.
Uh, R-Roland.
Speaking of the wedding, your mother and I must get together.
The plaza only seats 600, and I'm afraid that with all of our friends... only some of the relatives will be able to come.
Relatives.
Well...
Excuse me.
Uh, Gail.
Mr. Feinberger, Mrs. Feinberger,
I know this is real bad timing, but...
Arrests: statutory rape, possession of concealed weapon, Yo, Dalton!
I thought you went to Wall Street.
Possession of crack, crack, crack-
This I gotta hear.
Hey, Boesky!
- I'm lookin' for lightning.
- Got ups.
Got downs.
Got smiles.
Got frowns.
Got smoke.
Got blow.
Take you anywhere you wanna go.
I only have big bills.
That's cool.
Got plenty of change.
Could you, uh, turn off that box?
I really hate rap music.
Sure, my man.
- Thank you, man.
Car 54, 1091 Central Park West and 63rd,
Car 54.
K.
Cuff him!
Cuff him!
Where the fuck are you goin'?
I'm gonna help that young man over there.
Fuck him!
Take care of this one first!
This one's dead!
Would you get the fuckin' handcuffs off him?
Hey, fuck you, goddamn it!
Take it easy, man.
Get him to the hospital!
Police officer Patrick O'Leary was shot late last night in Central Park.
The mayor and the police commissioner expressed their outrage at a press conference at the widow's house in Queens.
O' Leary was the fourth police officer slain in the line of...
Hi.
Baby, baby, baby.
Congratulations.
Gail, you beamed me up...
you beamed me up in the middle of my ecstasy.
Do you think it's a little early in the morning for heavy metal?
Listen, Gail...
Gail, honey.
Sweetie, I love ya, I'm gonna marry ya, but you're making me feel very old.
This is not heavy metal.
This is Hendrix.
Genius, maybe.
But this is definitely not heavy metal.
Okay.
Okay?
Why don't you open your present?
Present.
Right.
What's the occasion?
Huh!
Congratulations?
For what?
On your last week with Legal Aid.
Hey.
Groovy.
Beautiful.
Why don't you wear one of the new suits Daddy's guy made for you?
Just try it.
I don't know, Gail.
I don't think the Wall Street garb'll swing with the Rikers Island crowd, you know?
They'll take me for a pimp.
What does that make me?
The best.
What are you drinking?
Orange julius, homemade.
Want some?
No.
No, thanks.
Oh, I've gotta run.
I have to be at Bumble and Bumble in 45 minutes, so try the new suit.
Yeah.
Remember to call about the apartment.
You bet.
And, Roland, about that tie...
- Yeah?
What about it?
I like this tie.
So, Dalton, you're finally gonna bag it at Legal Aid, huh, pal?
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
What about the fight for the underprivileged, the homeless and destitute?
You know what I'm talkin' about.
The good fight, pal.
Pap and drivel, bud.
Just liberal pap for the multitudes.
Right.
Okay.
Let's do it.
Okay.
These I gotta prosecute.
These I'm willing to let cop a plea.
You take the whole package, I let these go for time served.
It's beautiful.
Yeah, man.
All right.
- Groovy
- This is not a going away party, Dalton.
- I can't live with that.
- Come on, home.
It's my last week in the jungle, then I'm finito.
- Buy the next six lunches too?
- No guts, no glory.
Oh, baby.
Dalton, I never figured you for this upwardly mobile bullshit, man.
- It is a sellout.
- Hey, blood, the substance of law in America lies... in keeping the money in this country out of the hands of the widows and orphans... and in the hands of the major insurance companies, who know best...
Who know best how to manage it.
Hey Susan.
Hi, Sean.
Hi.
Hi.
From the looks of you, I'd say you found your insurance company.
Yeah, uh, Wall Street.
Next week.
You don't exactly look like chopped liver yourself.
Thanks.
Well, once again, I see that justice is being served... for lunch.
Here.
You forgot this one.
- just your average, crack-deaiin' cop killer.
It's no big deal.
- But I haven't interviewed him yet.
Could be innocent.
Not bloody likely.
Still, I'm impressed you still care about minor details such as that.
I'll meet you over at the pier.
You got it.
I'll see you in court.
Little history there, pal?
Yeah.
The whole world, man.
What she mean, "See you in court"?
Probably talkin' about that cop killer you got in your hand, pal.
What are you sayin'?
She's a public defender in Brooklyn.
No, she's not.
No?
- She's the new assistant D.A.
- Come on.
Is that straight?
Tag 'em and bag 'em, man.
You're dead.
Alma, what's the haps, babe?
Okay wise guy.
Through the detector.
Alma, why do you torture me with this...
Empty your pockets.
It's the watch.
It's the watch.
It's always the watch, watch.
See?
You love me.
You know it.
Statutory rape.
Possession of a deadly weapon.
Possession and sale of cocaine.
Possession and sale of crack.
Possession and sale of crack, crack, crack.
This I've gotta hear.
Hey, Boesky!
My name isn't Boesky.
You want a condom with your lunch?
- A condom?
- Yeah.
The mayor says we gotta offer every convict a condom a day... along with counseling on safe sex.
I don't want a condom.
I want a condom.
- Thank you very much.
- Michael Jones, Roland Dalton.
I'm a lawyer from Legal Aid.
I've been appointed to represent you.
You've been charged with first-degree murder of an undercover narcotics police officer.
You know, you don't look too bad for a guy who's been shot.
Shit.
That guy used a .38, man.
A .38 couldn't kill a cockroach.
That's why I use a nine-mil.
Hit somebody with a nine, they don't get up.
Oh, yeah?
You used a nine-mil on this cop?
Yeah.
What's the pitch, Michael?
Are you not gonna tell me you didn't do it?
Of course I did it.
I'm in the park selling' drugs.
White dude come up to me, pull out a gun, say, "Give me your money."
- So I shot him.
Self-defense.
- Michael, you want a lawyer or you want your mother?
'Cause she's the only fool that's gonna buy that bag of shit.
Hey, man, I done a lot of bad things, but I'm not stupid.
- I don't lie to my lawyer.
- Here we go.
- That dude was a blue jean cop, man.
- Blue jean cop?
Yeah.
Blue jean cop.
What are you sayin'?
You shot him 'cause you didn't like his pants?
Dude didn't even show me no badge, man.
I didn't know he was a cop till they booked my ass.
I thought he was a vigilante.
Had to defend myself.
Well, that little mistake may very well get your ass cooked.
Shit, man.
I work for somebody who pays his bills.
Crack.
You dig?
- I dig.
- This cop must've been trying to cut hisself a piece of my man's action.
Shit.
All he had to do was say so.
I'd have handed him my green, let him and my man work it out.
I don't steal no dust between N.C. and the pigs.
Who's N.C.?
Ohh, man, I didn't say that.
Mornin', Richie.
Mornin', Billy.
Hup.
Hey, babe, I'm white and can't fight.
Well, comin' up in the world, huh?
What's, uh...
What's the mortgage on this condo?
What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doin' here, man?
I'm brushing' my fuckin' teeth.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
How did you find me?
Your old lady.
She told me to tell you if you don't get your ass home and do the right thing, she's gonna pack up all your shit and ship it back to Rope and Ride or Bump and Grind... or whatever the hell the name it is of that hick town in Texas you come from.
- What else did she say?
- She said pick up the laundry.
Right.
See what you got to look forward to, Counselor?
Hows your fiancée?
Ehh, she doesn't like Jimi Hendrix.
- Who?
- Come on.
Let's get some chow.
My treat.
- Do I smell another shakedown?
- That's verdad gringo.
Nice tie.
I knew there was a reason I liked you.
Look at this, Marks.
I don't believe all this glass, man.
What is this shit?
Empty crack containers, Counselor.
Popcorn.
If you wanna know what the latest drug craze is, check out Uncle Billy's trash can.
Junkies come and go, but Billy's trash can is always there.
Right now it's full of that shit.
Speaking of that shit, tell me something.
What's a blue jean cop?
Where'd you hear that?
From a client.
Well, I'm strictly bargain basement:
Wranglers and Levi's.
You lost me.
Guys I bust, on the other hand, wear Sergio Valentes.
Richie, you wanna run this by me in English?
All right.
Take some cop, some average guy who never had a shot at a big bust in all his life.
Just goin' along, grinding' out his 27,500 a year.
All of a sudden he ends up on a narc squad.
One mustard.
One afternoon he busts some scumbag carrying a bagful of chemicals.
That bagful of chemicals is worth more than that cop's gonna make in 10 years.
Next day he's out shoppin' for designer jeans.
Lure of easy money.
Very hard to refuse.
What about this cop who got whacked in Central Park, O'Leary?
Was that the deal with him?
Why are you workin' up such a sweat about this?
Word is you're out of the game in another week.
Call me a creature of habit.
O'Leary.
What about him?
"What about him?" Oh, great.
Thanks.
Come on, Dalton.
Even if I knew the answer to that, I'm not gonna tell you.
Fuck, man.
I gotta find out what's goin' down here.
So look around.
Oh. "Look around." Great.
What?
Look.
Who?
What?
I'm gonna tell you somethin', Dalton.
Cops don't know shit about hidin' money.
Check out his house.
His house?
Okay.
It killed you to tell me that, didn't it?
The last of the big fuckin' spenders, man.
Great.
Double or nothin', Richie.
Straight up.
How come no designer jeans for you?
I just figured they were meant for girls with cute little asses... and guys with no balls.
Besides, I'm independently wealthy.
Oh, right.
I love what you did with the condo.
This ain't high school, Dalton.
These guys got guns and money and not a fuckin' thing to lose.
I appreciate the advice.
P.S. Who's N.C.?
You just don't fuckin' get it, do ya?
Just don't get it.
Don't fuck with these people.
Richie, I don't wanna fuck with 'em.
I just wanna dance.
Uh, Mrs. O'Leary, I'm involved with the people prosecuting the man who killed your husband.
I know this may not be the most appropriate time, but I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I may.
Come in.
I was just making some tea.
Would you like some?
Or something stronger?
I'll, uh, have whatever you're having.
Okay.
Where the hell is Marks?
Why isn't he with us?
He's downtown.
He's picking up the warrants.
He's gonna take the subway up here and meet us.
It's cool.
Don't worry.
I would never take a subway to this part of town.
What?
What are you talkin' about?
He's a cop.
He's got a gun.
Patrick O'Leary was a cop.
He had a gun.
This place is worse than Beirut.
What do you want from me, huh?
If you guys wouldn't mind, could I get out of this car before we get there?
I mean, you're supposed to be undercover, but even a blind man could tell you're cops.
If someone sees me with you, I'm dead meat.
Listen, Dipshit!
If somebody sees you with us, you are dead meat.
You know, they're gonna kill you, baby.
Cut your balls off, gouge your eyes out.
But it's gonna be over soon enough.
But if the information you've given us turns out to be bullshit, we're gonna put you in a cell with Big Leroy, a 350-pound bull nigger faggot.
And when you got out in five years maybe, you'll be able to look up your asshole and see the sky.
- Don't fuck with me.
- Stevie, Stevie.
Give me another cigarette, will ya?
Buy your own.
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- I really appreciate this.
You're quite...
quite welcome.
Where are your cans?
Are they in the garage?
Yeah.
Um, no.
Well, the garage is locked.
Just put it at the bottom of the stairs.
That's it.
This okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.
Bye.
Bye.
Thanks.
Ladies, put your bags on the conveyor.
And, gentlemen, let's see your green.
Good.
Now, one at a time, walk through the detector.
Welcome to Wonderland.
- Welcome.
- Whoa.
Listen.
You think that was real?
Did you hear those screams?
You can't fake that.
I think they really cut them up.
Please.
You gotta let me have some more.
You've got to.
You know the rules.
No credit.
Cash only.
But, uh, I don't have any more on me.
I'll pay you back.
I promise.
Mr. Carr decides things like that.
But I wouldn't advise it.
Please?
Tell the man your story.
Uh...
I gave them all my money.
But I need more.
For most, there's no other way but pay.
But for you, maybe there's another.
Here's Marks.
Let's go.
Dipshit, take off.
All right.
You ready to rock 'n' roll?
Yeah.
I'm ready.
Good.
You got them fuckin' warrants?
Yeah.
Shit.
All right.
Here's the deal.
These watches here are synchronized.
At exactly 11:11, you blow out the back, we'll blow in the front.
You see anything you like?
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Everybody freeze!
Move all of them out!
Come on!
Let's go!
Go!
Go!
Faster!
Okay.
Okay.
Over to the bar.
Go!
Go!
Get on the fuckin' wall.
Get up!
Why don't you take Mr. Nicky downtown?
We'll stay here, clean up, book the evidence.
Give me the toy.
Let's see how you dance, scale.
Because of the quantity of drugs seized and the defendant's prior record,
I'm going to set cash bail at one million dollars.
Objection!
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
You're the prosecutor, and you're objecting to one million dollars cash bail?
Yes, Your Honor.
It's not enough.
Miss Cantrell, it's 11:55 on a Friday night.
That's a lot of cash to come up with at this hour.
Nicky Carr can pull that amount out of his small change purse.
It's not enough to ensure that he'll appear for trial.
Objection overruled.
Mr. Rosen, do you have anything to say?
Yes, Your Honor.
My client will make bail.
Fuck.
- Evidence room.
- Hello.
Larry?
This is Margaret O'Leary.
Someone broke into the garage last night.
I think they saw Patrick's car.
Uh, thanks.
I'll get back to you on that.
Larry, I'm worried.
Can you talk now?
No.
I'll call you...
I'll call you later.
Just checkin' to see if the Nicky Carr evidence got booked in all right.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's there.
Good.
- A lot of cash, wasn't it?
- It was a lot of cash, but it wasn't "a lot" of cash.
Yeah.
Give me two of whatever he's having.
You want a quadruple boilermaker?
Yeah, and a Pepsi.
I hope you're not planning on driving home.
I got no plans, Richie.
But speaking' of driving', there's a brand-new, bright red, Porsche Cabriolet, turbo, stuck under a tarp in the back of O'Learys garage.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yep.
I don't know.
I just don't know, Richie.
Once upon a time, all I planned to do was play the tenor sax... forever.
That's it.
Villes-ville, man.
But my dad, everybody, said I was a sap.
No money in it.
So I go to law school, and I am here now.
Gone from that other place.
But I could play the tenor sax all day and all night.
Everything was possible, and I was very certain that at any minute...
I was going to meet the love of my life.
The love of your life?
Yeah.
I met the love of my life, only I killed her dog... before I had a chance to tell her.
Man, she was everything I ever wanted.
We met at "Shakespeare in the Park."
I told her I was a lawyer.
That line seemed to work for you.
Rained like hell that day.
Had an umbrella.
We went back to her apartment.
She went to the bathroom.
I sat on the couch.
She had this great big damn dog.
The dog had a ball, so I threw it.
The dog brought it back.
I threw it again... harder.
I'll never forget the sound of that dog's paws on the newly waxed floors.
How was I supposed to know she left the window open?
That dog fell 13 stories, landed on the top of a parked car.
I went over, leaned out the window, looked down, threw up and left.
Left.
Without ever telling' her she was the one.
Happy is the fleeting hope of youth.
Who said that?
Me.
I'm gonna take this case, Richie.
Good for you, Counselor.
Me too.
Hi.
I'm lookin' for a runner.
About this high, white, 135 pounds, brown hair.
Wears a little ponytail.
He was wearing a pair of gray pants and a flashy Kind of gray sweater... and a pair of felony fliers the night of the bust.
Hey, cop, what's your problem?
This place is legal now.
You lookin' for a cut, you gotta talk to your boys down at the station.
Yeah.
Get up.
- I said get up.
- Hey, cop, stop harassing' me before I call my lawyer.
You know what this is?
It's a gun.
It's a gun.
You're a fuckin' genius.
Now, listen to this.
This gun is clean.
No serial numbers.
So after I blow out what's left of your brains and chuck it in the East River, your case is closed.
People downtown are gonna file it under D.S.A.F.
"Did Society A Favor."
You got it?
I understand.
I understand.
Now, where is he?
Stevie's on the Deuce over at the New Amsterdam.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You said you wanted to go along for the ride.
- Yeah, man.
- The bus is leavin', amigo.
Okay.
Where?
New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street.
Thirty minutes.
I'm down.
Ira!
Hey.
Nice to see ya.
Whoa.
Wait a minute, Stevie.
Yeah.
This one looks real.
You bet your ass it's real.
Hey, Bob, I want you to change the sheets in the honeymoon suite.
This is what I got, and this is what I want.
Stevie.
Which room is he in?
You know how it is, Chief.
I don't think he wants to be disturbed right now.
Honeymoon suite.
He's in the honeymoon suite.
Oh.
Huh.
Shit.
Real, live girls, gentlemen.
Real, live girls.
Look at Bobbie in booth three, Melody in booth four... and Tamara in booth five.
These are real, live women...
live flesh.
Step into a booth.
Richie, Richie, look, I don't know what kind of party we're crashing' up here, but you don't happen to have a little somethin' for me, do ya, like a bazooka?
You know how to use one of these?
Fuckin' a bubba.
I'm from New York City.
Don't shoot me in the ass.
Holy shit.
Oh, yeah.
Police officer.
Freeze!
Hands up.
Get your goddamn hands up.
Anything you say, Officer.
Grab him!
You son of a bitch!
Hey!
You drive.
I'll shoot.
Stay back, motherfucker!
That's my house, you son of a bitch!
Get off!
Where you goin', Max?
Hey, Rydell.
Too bad about Dipshit, huh?
He gave us a lot of good tips.
Yeah, I'll bet he did.
What kind of shit you carryin'?
That ain't regulation.
It's the gun I own to exercise my constitutional right to bear arms.
Hey, ain't you something?
Big John Wayne fan, huh?
.45 Magnum.
Plan on taking down an army?
I don't know yet.
Right.
Sweetheart, I'm going to bed.
Okay.
Good night.
Did you call about the apartment?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I forgot.
I forgot all about it.
I've had all this work to do.
My ass still aches from that motorcycle.
I...
Roland, you promised.
If we don't call, we lose the apartment.
I know, Gail.
I know.
I'll call about the apartment tomorrow.
I just can't believe you're spending all this time trying to get this guy set free, and you can't find five minutes to do something that's really important for us.
This guy's a crack dealer.
He's a rapist.
People like him belong in jail.
- I can't believe you want him out.
- I don't necessarily want him out.
- I just don't want him in for something he didn't do.
- Who cares if he did it?
If he didn't do this, he damn sure did something else.
Who gives a fuck if he's innocent?
- Well, I do.
I give a fuck.
- For Christ's sake, this man sells death to schoolkids.
Gail.
Hey, hey, sweetie.
What's goin' on here, huh?
Come here.
Now, what's all this about, huh?
Is this some kind of panic that I'm gonna take a left turn on your dad's offer about his law firm?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Yeah?
I just don't understand your fascination with all this.
Hey, it's all in your mind.
I'll call about the apartment.
I promise.
I'll call tomorrow.
All right?
Okay.
And you love me, right?
I...
I love you.
A lot.
A lot.
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, one thing I promise not to do in this courtroom, is to pretend to you... that I am representing Snow White for a client.
The simple fact of the matter is that all the Seven Dwarfs couldn't match his record...
- on a weekend pass in Singapore.
I'm not going to conceal this fact from you, and I apologize to my humble colleague, the district attorney, for snatching that ham bone from her plate.
However, I do promise to use every means of persuasion I can muster... to prove to you that my client, Michael Jones, did not commit the crime of first-degree murder, but that he in fact shot Officer Patrick O'Leary in self-defense.
Humorous yet restrained.
Rhetorical yet substantive.
You managed to cover everything except the will of God.
I'm saving that for my closing.
I thought so.
You cleared for miracles?
Cecil B. DeMille would be proud.
I'm glad I have a front-row seat.
Okay.
What's the deal?
No deals today, buddy.
You missed that boat.
I'm taking your boy to the max.
I'm not talking about that deal.
I'm talking about this deal.
What gives?
What do you want from me?
Do I look like I want something?
Why don't you take your mind games... and run 'em by those dorks at the A.C.L.U., 'cause I don't have time for this bullshit.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Your star is rising in the financial arena.
Correct.
- Complete with Miss Right, I hear, too.
- Hey, look, Susan.
I loved you better than anybody's ever gonna love you in your lifetime, and you left me holding the bag.
You took a hike, remember?
Now, I can't figure it, but I pull myself together, I move on, and... boom... you show up here?
Well, look, I didn't ask for it and I didn't want it, so why don't we just sort of swing on through this with a minimum of bloodshed?
In case you didn't grasp that, I was crazy about you.
Isn't that your waking state?
Look, do me a favor, will ya?
just tell me so I can quit buggin' myself about it.
Just tell me why.
You were turning cynical and judgmental and berating and mean.
Oh?
You concocted some bullshit story about how credit cards were gonna save your life.
Why didn't you tell me that then?
I did... in my own way.
You just didn't hear it.
Oh.
I miss you, Roland.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what are we gonna do now?
Gentlemen, I got $10,000... that says the Harlem Shuffle gon' kick The Crackers ass.
Anybody want a piece, see the man.
All right?
Come on, baby.
Yo, yo, yo!
Whoo!
What we gon' do?
Win!
That's right!
Yeah!
Yeah!
We're gonna win, man!
Oh, shit.
Hold this, baby.
Rydell, you know, you could fuck up a wet dream.
Come on.
We gotta talk.
This is my play time.
Can I at least watch the race?
Sure.
I ain't here to give out parking tickets.
Let's get it on!
Shit.
Tough luck, Cracker.
Hey, get my money.
Now, what can I do for you?
- Richie Marks.
- What about him?
I see.
What's in it for me?
Evidence against you... in the police department safe, disappears.
A hundred and forty-seven thousand dollars... and seven pounds of cocaine... just disappears, from the police evidence safe, huh?
Won't be the first time.
I got your message.
You the new boy at the precinct.
You'll find out I always pay my bills.
But the people I work for are just a little pissed off.
What the fuck happened in Central Park?
A one-time, small-time mistake.
Ain't gonna happen again.
Fifty "K" a month, and midtown north is yours.
Don't be worryin' about no Michael Jones.
I'm gonna clean up that mess personally.
But you... are gonna have to take care of Richie Marks.
It's a deal.
You do your thing.
I'll take care of Marks pronto.
I forgot how much I love this room.
My tree house.
I forgot how much I love listening to you.
I forgot how much I love having you here.
You like to lie in bed and chitchat, don't you?
Except you do most of the talking.
Yeah, I do.
I gotta go..
I won't be your mistress, Dalton.
Well, I just can't not show up.
Make it easier for both of us.
This time it was what it was.
If there's a next time, you have to stay the whole night.
So I just put a bow on that package and present it to my fiancee?
That's up to you, my dear.
I said, does the defense have any questions?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Yes, Your Honor, we do.
We have some questions.
Uh, Officer Varelli, when you came upon the scene, you recognized the deceased to be a police officer.
- Is that right?
- Yes, I did.
In fact, you knew him to be an undercover police officer... investigating narcotics in your area, correct?
That's correct.
When you...
When you approached Officer O'Leary, he was lying on the ground unconscious.
Objection.
Conclusion.
Sustained.
Okay, uh, Officer Varelli, his eyes were closed?
Yes.
He was not moving?
No, he wasn't.
- It was dear to you that he was not in any semblance of mind...
Objection!
Conclusion.
Sustained.
Officer Varelli, when you arrived upon the scene, were there any other police officers in the proximity, except for your partner?
No.
To the best of your knowledge, isn't it correct police procedure... when an officer is going to make a narcotics arrest on the street... to have some sort of backup presence, some sort of assistance, some sort of support or protection?
Usually that's the case.
Well, in your experience, don't you find it highly unusual, if an officer's gonna be engaged in the dangerous circumstances of a narcotics arrest, to be proceeding alone?
Objection!
Your Honor, this is conjecture.
What is usual for Officer Varelli may not be for someone else.
Patrick O'Leary was an undercover policeman.
What his particular procedure was, we do not know.
Sustained.
In any event, Officer Varelli, Officer O'Leary's partner never arrived, nor did anyone else resembling a human being... who claimed to have any work with him.
- True?
- That's true.
So what you saw was, you saw a man lying on the ground who was shot.
But you did not actually see anyone do the shooting, did you?
Of course not.
I already said I wasn't there.
But it's obvious what happened.
No, I submit to you that it is not obvious what happened.
It is not obvious, but it is fair to say that you assumed what happened... because you were not there, Officer Varelli, and you did not see what happened.
Right.
I already said that.
Right.
And your assumption was that Patrick O'Leary, in the middle of a narcotics arrest, was shot by Michael Jones.
But since you were not there, you could assume anything.
You could assume, as a matter of fact, that maybe Patrick O'Leary shot himself.
Or maybe you could assume, because you were not there, that Patrick O'Leary did not identify himself as a police officer because his badge was not out, and you could assume, Officer Varelli, that Patrick O'Leary pulled his gun out first and shot Michael Jones,
Objection!
planning to kill him and steal his money and his drugs!
Objection!
Could you assume that, Officer Varelli?
Bullshit!
Mr. Dalton, you will please approach the bench.
Nice moves.
Dazzling, aren't I?
But what do you got after that, though?
Hang on tight, partner.
Oh, I see.
The ride gets rougher than this.
You betcha.
That's just the way I like it.
You'd better watch out.
I can roll with anything you put out, buddy.
Yeah, you're a regular bronc buster.
That's what's called a discreet turn of the phrase, right?
You got it, cowboy.
Well, I'm gonna brand you this time, horsie, so everybody knows you're mine.
How's that grab you?
Oh, yeah?
Where's your iron?
Tell her.
Can you handle this, or is this too real for you?
Yeah, I can handle it.
Just do me a favor, will ya?
Professional or personal?
Personal.
Done.
Whisper "yippee-yi-oh" in my ear.
Roland!
- Hi!
- Oh, hi, Gail.
How are you, doll?
Mr. Feinberger.
Roland.
Can you believe it?
I told Daddy we were having lunch, and he said that he was free and he'd join us.
Can you imagine Daddy being free for lunch?
I can't.
Let's do it.
Ow!
Come on.
Come on.
Oh!
God!
Attempted murder of a police officer.
That's gonna get your friend here three years in the joint.
What you gonna do?
Gonna go along with him, or you wanna assume the position... and let me bust you for loitering or some other bullshit charge?
I know what you're thinking.
You're young and fast, and I'm old and slow.
What are you gonna do, asshole?
Dumb fuckin' question.
Police officer!
- Everybody get down!
- Get down!
Get down!
Get outta my way!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back!
Fuck you, Marks!
No, actually, asshole, it's... fuck you.
Oh, Jesus.
Better get a shovel.
Wow.
Who's writing this report?
Yeah, yeah, Sorry.
Huh?
Good morning.
Yeah.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You want something to eat?
Yes, I want something to eat.
God, I love you.
I didn't tell her.
I lied to her, told her I was going to Boston.
And she believed you?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't she?
Sure.
Don't be so sure, Dalton.
Women aren't stupid.
I wanted to tell her.
I wanted to, but then her dad showed up for lunch.
Oh, so your guts dried up in the face of Daddy Warbucks.
Now, is this gonna be some kind of female territorial doo-wop?
- You know, you really piss me off.
- Here we go.
This isn't about me.
This is about you.
Yeah, I'm a woman, and I'm jealous.
So what?
This is about you... and who you are, and who you really wanna be.
You know, you really lose the best of yourself when you're around the gold.
Now here we are, one year ago, back in the high-jive self-realization riff.
So you're gonna take 14 years of Legal Aid and chuck it out the window.
You just don't get it, do you?
I mean, you got me as some kind of retrograde Clarence Darrow or something.
You just don't get it.
You keep thinking I'm leaving Legal Aid 'cause I wanna be somewhere else.
I'm outta here, babe, because it's kicking the life out of me.
See?
Day in and day fucking out... with the scumbags and the jerk-offs and the sex creeps... and the freaks and the killers.
Goddamn it!
I can't live in it anymore.
And God forbid I get somebody, just one somebody who's innocent and I can't prove it, so instead of risking a loss...
I gotta plea-bargain his ass so he doesn't do eight years of hard time... he ends up only doing one, in Attica with the rest of the human puke.
But that doesn't matter anyway, because after one year in that nightmare, his life is over.
And so what if I want things...
Susan?
People want shit, you know.
I want things!
I know.
Life's a bitch, huh, Roland?
Why do you think it's so goddamned manifest destiny for me... to be picking shit with the chickens the rest of my life?
Because you love it.
You love it to death.
And of everything you do, it's the thing you do best.
Now, Mr. Mastrangelo, you stated that you owned and operated... a reputable, honest exotic automobile business, right?
Yes, I did.
The Casa d'Oro Custom Car Emporium.
Correct?
That's right.
Sounds like a brothel in Tangiers.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
You also stated that Officer O'Leary purchased... a customized turbo Porsche Cabriolet.
Right.
And that he paid $87,300 for it?
Right.
How did he pay for it?
Cash.
He paid cash.
And did you give him a warranty?
- No.
- Did you give him a receipt?
No.
So, in fact, there is no record of this actual transaction.
We have some records.
But we recently moved locations and, uh, they got lost in the shuffle.
So you would just have this court take your word for it that this actually occurred.
- Well, it's the truth.
- And you would tell the truth because you're an honest and reputable man.
Objection, Your Honor.
The district attorney is obviously badgering and ridiculing this witness.
Overruled.
Isn't it a fact that on February 10, 1984, you were convicted of trafficking interstate stolen automobiles?
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Sustained.
Miss Cantrell.
No more questions.
Your Honor, at this time I would like to call as my last witness... the defendant, Michael Jones.
Will the defendant please rise... and approach the witness box.
Swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
For the record, state your full name, your occupation and where you live.
Michael Ezekial Jones.
I'm a drug dealer.
I live in Rikers Island Prison.
The witness may take the stand.
Michael Jones.
Michael Ezekial Jones.
Now, Michael, would you tell us, in your own words, exactly what happened to you on Friday night, October 9, approximately 10:00 p.m... in Central Park, near the west side 61st Street pedestrian tunnel.
I was selling drugs.
A white guy came up to me, asked to buy lightning'... the stuff you call crack.
I told him I had some.
He said he only had big bills.
I said I had plenty change.
He reached into his jacket, and instead of pulling out his wallet, he pulled out a gun.
He looked at me in my eye and said,
"Good-bye, nigger."
I thought he was gonna kill me.
I didn't know he was no cop.
I...
I went for my gun.
He fired, and I fired.
I remember gettin' hit.
I don't remember no more.
I, uh...
I was one of the first two cops to come upon the O'Leary death scene.
I'm the one that booked the evidence.
The black kid's ghetto blaster, when I found it, was in the "record" position.
Did you listen to the tape?
No.
I've heard rumors.
I don't even wanna know if they're true.
Why are you telling me this now?
One of the cops that got killed in Times Square by that scale you finally got... was my brother.
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen, if I give this information to the defense attorney?
A lot of brother officers are gonna go down in the investigation this thing causes.
Yeah, this is Police Officer Marks.
I got an emergency call for defense attorney Roland Dalton.
Mr. Jones, have you ever been arrested for selling crack before?
Yeah.
And when you were arrested was the officer wearing a uniform or street clothes?
Street clothes.
And also when you were arrested, did he pull out his badge and say, "Hello, I'm a police officer"?
Or did he try to buy some drugs and make a deal...
Your Honor, excuse me.
I request a personal emergency recess.
Your Honor, I object to this transparent ploy.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
I know it seems hideously contrived, except I request an emergency personal recess.
Well, it's 10 minutes of 4:00.
This court will recess until 9:00 tomorrow morning.
Excuse me...
Gail?
Oh, wait!
Hi!
Gail...
Hi.
Richie Marks is waiting for me.
He's got something...
I gotta talk to you about something.
I gotta talk to you.
There's something very important I have to tell you...
Wait.
I'm pregnant.
Isn't that great?
God!
Really?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well...
Well...
Gail...
Listen, this is great...
I threw up this morning.
You did?
Richie Marks is waiting for me with a thing...
Oh.
Okay.
Uh, no, sweetie, we'll...
Tonight.
Bye.
Come on.
Come on.
Get your hands off me.
Come on!
I'm just gonna get some candy!
Uh, Sergeant, my name is Roland Dalton.
I'm from Legal Aid.
I got a court order here giving me access to your evidence room.
Did you hear me?
Well, can you read?
This is a court order.
Up the fucking stairs!
Thanks.
Oh, no.
I'm gettin' out of here.
Come on.
It's over.
Come here.
Come here.
Hey.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Come back here.
Mr. Christian, sit down.
Come here.
Evidence Room.
Dalton's coming up.
All right.
Thanks.
Yo, I got a court order here... that grants me access to certain evidence in the Jones-O'Leary case.
This is a court order.
Dig?
Oh, Christ.
This is a shame.
My key just broke off in the lock.
It did?
Yeah.
Well, I don't suppose between you and the putz downstairs you got a pair of bolt cutters.
Well, Maintenance does, but they knock off at, uh, 5:00.
You have to come back in the morning.
In the morning.
Yeah.
Thanks.
You know, uh...
You cops, you're the best that money can buy.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
So, what were you looking for?
True love.
Isn't that what we're all looking for?
That's cute.
That's very cute.
So, you're a tough guy, huh?
What were you looking for?
I think I wish to speak to my lawyer.
Al Fallon of Legal Aid.
Just speak to my asshole, huh?
What were you looking for?
What the fuck are you doin'?
Shut the fuck up!
Let's play again.
You got lucky last time.
The tape.
Okay, the tape.
The tape.
What tape?
The tape...
M...
Michael Jones recorded everything on the tape recorder.
The tape's in the ghetto blaster.
Play the fucking tape.
What the fuck is that?
Thank you, man.
Good-bye, nigger.
Alright, don't get nervous.
I'm going downstairs to the fire alarm box.
When the bell goes off...
shoot him.
- I shoot him?
- Yeah.
His fingerprints are all over the bolt cutter and the evidence room locker.
I haven't got a clean gun.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
There are 245,000 of those police specials floating around New York City.
By the time they figure this shit out, we'll be long gone.
This your evidence?
Here's your evidence.
Well, hurry up and go pull the goddamn thing!
Just do it.
Where's Dalton?
Third floor, interrogation room.
He's waiting for his lawyer.
Hello, baby?
Daddy's coming home real soon.
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Oh!
Goddamn!
Oh, fuck!
Richie, get that tape!
The tape!
The tape!
Goddamn it, man, they...
How you cloing'?
They had the gun...
They had the gun at my head.
Court- I gotta get to...
Listen...
Listen...
Okay?
I gotta...
Court, man...
Goddamn it, what a world.
What a fucking world.
Do I know you?
Hey!
I recognize you from TV.
You're the guy defending the cop killer.
- Alleged cop killer.
Alleged.
- What, you mean he didn't do it?
- Yeah, man, he did it, but he did it in self-defense.
- Really?
Yeah, really.
- Hey they coming after you?
- Yep.
Yep.
They're coming after me.
Why?
Well, because a bad cop lied to 'em, and I know the truth.
And if they know I know the truth, a lot of bad cops are in deep fucking trouble.
So let's go to court.
Hey, I studied the constitution.
I passed my citizenship test.
You got a right to be at the court.
I'll get you to court.
You hold on.
Yeah?
Oh yeah?
Hey, fuck you!
Bring it up!
Yahoo!
Mr. Dalton!
What in hell is going on here?
Your Honor, I have a court order.
I have evidence that...
This tape is...
Police officers, don't...
It's vital you hear the truth...
Bailiff, bring Mr. Dalton to my chambers.
- Your Honor, I have to arrest him.
- On the street, you are the law.
But on the steps of this courthouse, I am the law.
If this police officer does not lower his gun, arrest him for obstructing justice.
Go ahead, white bread.
Make my day.
Judge Maynard, there's evidence on this tape...
Mr. Dalton!
The legal ramifications that would allow you to testify... about what you heard, or maybe didn't hear, on this tape... or even if this tape is, in fact, the tape that was in Michael Jones's radio at the time of the alleged incident...
I mean, it boggles the mind!
I cannot allow it to be introduced as evidence.
Now, Miss Cantrell... will complete her cross -examination, and then both of you will give your closing arguments.
And then I will give this case to the jury.
And, Mr. Dalton, if the jury should rule against you, you can exercise your right of appeal.
And that is that.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I'd like to... give you a few words from the book of Matthew, if I may... chapter 10, verses 26 and 27.
"There is nothing covered up that shall not be uncovered;
"There is nothing hidden that shall not be known.
"Whatever I say to you in the dark you must repeat in the daylight, and whatever is whispered you must shout from the rooftops."
Now, the truth... the truth ain't always pleasant.
But the truth, however, is... always the truth.
Now, the prosecution... would have you believe that this is just some simple, straightforward case... a bad man shoots down... a decorated police officer in the line of duty... to avoid one more in a long series of endless arrests.
However, I say... that Officer Patrick O'Leary... was not working in the line of duty Friday night, October 9, and I say that Officer Patrick O'Leary made a lot of money... stealing from drug dealers.
And I also say that Patrick O'Leary, on Friday night, October 9, didn't even bother to identify himself to my client, Michael Jones.
If he had, he'd be alive today.
You've already heard Michael Jones acknowledge to you, admit, confess time and time again under cross-examination by the district attorney, that he considered it standard operating procedure, simply the cost of doing business, to pay off cops.
But Officer Patrick O'Leary pulled out his gun... before he pulled out his badge.
And my client, Michael Jones, thought he was some kind of nut.
Hey, so would I.
Wouldn't you?
And after being shot once, point-blank, by Patrick O'Leary.
My client, drug dealer or no, pulled out his own gun and fired in self-defense.
The prosecution's case rests on two points.
One...
Gotta cut me loose.
What?
C-Can't do the time.
Won't make it...
inside this go-round.
Can't do the time.
You can't do the time.
You can't do the time, Michael?
But you can take money from these 10-year-old kids and blow holes in their lives... with that poison you push?
Now you wanna cry on my shoulder 'cause you can't do the time?
Stand up.
Hey, man, chill out.
Stand up!
I'm standing!
You stand too!
Jury's back.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
Will the defendant please rise and face the jury.
Will the foreman read the verdict.
The jury finds the defendant... not guilty.
That's great, Mike.
See you in jail.
I dig these love notes in class, Richie.
What's the haps?
Carr and Rydell are headin' for the airport.
Wanna drive, or wanna shoot?
I'll drive, you shoot!
Hey, baby.
It's not forever.
I'll be back.
Besides, Costa Rica's just a puddle hop away.
Richie, this is O'Leary's wheels.
You copped O'Leary's car.
I didn't think he'd give a shit.
Come on!
Keep going!
So long, sucker.
- Jesus Christ!
- Losing hydraulics!
The landing gear won't retract!
Tower, this is 750-Alpha-Charlie!
Flame out.
Flame out, port engine.
Shut it down!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
LaGuardia Tower, we have to land!
- Roger.
- 750-Alpha-Charlie, come in.
LaGuardia Tower, transfer...
Richie, I love ya, pal, but you are definitely new to the planet.
Roland?
I have a confession to make.
What?
The rabbit.
It never died.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want to lose you.
Everyone, there's something I need to tell you.
I lost the baby.
I'm not pregnant anymore.
Oh, Gail, I...
it's okay.
I really don't even want to talk about it.
Besides, we have loads of time for children.
And now I'm not gonna have to buy that larger wedding dress.
Uh, R-Roland.
Speaking of the wedding, your mother and I must get together.
The plaza only seats 600, and I'm afraid that with all of our friends... only some of the relatives will be able to come.
Relatives.
Well...
Excuse me.
Uh, Gail.
Mr. Feinberger, Mrs. Feinberger,
I know this is real bad timing, but...
Arrests: statutory rape, possession of concealed weapon, Yo, Dalton!
I thought you went to Wall Street.
Possession of crack, crack, crack-
This I gotta hear.
Hey, Boesky!
ANGEL GUTS:
RED VERTIGO
Mayako Katsuragi
- Nami
Naoto Takenaka
- Muraki
I'm sorry.
You been out having fun with that guy?
No.
Things go wrong when you're not sleeping properly.
Sure.
Writer Director Takashi Ishii
I'll have to work over the holiday.
Nami. I promised we'd see a movie.
That's fine with me.
- Has something gone wrong?
- Huh?
It's come out fine.
Take a seat.
You haven't had a break, so you must be tired.
I'm OK, I'm OK.
Your work is what really counts.
Who's this one?
Pretty, isn't she?
Which one?
Oh, her.
She works in cabaret.
She's a dog.
A dog.
There've been a lot recently pictures of the girl.
Really?
It's all done according to what seems to be the editor's taste.
It's all part of the service.
Good photos, aren't they?
The camera shows the trust in her face.
Her faith in you.
Nami, is this the girl worrying you?
Why do you ask?
It's just a job.
Part of it involves lots of girls being around.
It's no big thing to me.
That's why I give you a hand.
I trust you.
It's cool.
Something's out of gear.
Is it down there?
Stop it.
We don't have time for that.
Nami, if you were prepared to work with me I wouldn't mind not taking pictures of the other girls.
It's not for me...
displaying myself.
But they're all Nami it's always Nami's image I'm taking.
My only thoughts are of Nami.
I'm so pleased.
Don't worry about me.
I believe in you.
Wouldn't it be nice?
- Let me take some.
- l don't want to.
Do we have time?
Looking good, Nami.
Great.
Nami, you're so good-looking.
Kenji.
What's the matter?
She's in love?
Is it 203?
I'll see to it.
You don't mind?
Get it together.
What's gone wrong?
Something something's... come adrift.
From your willie?
It feels like something wet's coming out.
I've fixed it.
It had parted at the join.
Now it won't happen again.
Good.
Relax and rest.
Sleep's your top priority.
Yes.
- If it's for me, I'm not here
- Fine.
Hello.
He didn't come by today.
Yes.
Thanks.
Same one as before?
Don't think it was.
But these last two days there've been a lot of people asking 'Is Muraki there?
'
They don't stand on ceremony.
- Is it true what they say?
- What's that?
Yesterday, you went off with money belonging to your company's investors.
It was because they fired you.
That's ridiculous.
Would I do something crazy like that?
It's alright, isn't it?
The nest egg I gave you to invest?
Have I once let you down?
Hey, let's have a little drink together.
The bar's closed.
Don't pick it up.
Sit down and have a drink.
Why not?
You wouldn't let me down.
Your glass?
I'm this bar's good luck mascot.
In a way.
But maybe not recently.
There's no reason to say that.
Isn't it the same old story.
The magic touch has disappeared.
But one more time with you things might get better.
How about an investment of 100,000.
You'll triple it in six months.
Right, that's settled.
What's with you?
It's because your wife left you, you think I...
Do you want me to play wifey to you?
You've said it.
Don't do that.
Don't do that here.
Where are you off to?
Pee pee.
Haven't you just had one?
Wait...
Mama...
I said wait.
Mama.
Mama.
Mama.
What's that?
So you're here, are you?
Don't you worry.
I'm the keystone of that company.
Ten or twenty million yen is nothing to them.
They can easily cover up for me.
Oh, I'm in pain.
Give me your hand.
You never give up, do you?
- This is Muraki speaking,
- What time do you think it is?
,We're not at home at the moment, Please leave your message, I didn't invest my 20 million yen for your pleasure.
Even if it kills you, you have to give me back that money.
Shall I burn down your house.
so you can claim on the insurance?
Just sell your wife to a pimp.
She's already gone.
Yes.
What's wrong?
I'm feeling sick.
I'll be with you.
Get a move on.
Bitch.
She's all ready...
... waiting for you.
I'm going to.
I'm going to.
I'm going to because I'm dying.
What's happening?
I thought this place was closed up.
Doctor.
Please call a doctor.
Miss Tsuchiya.
Kenji, my dear.
Help me, Kenji.
Help me.
Kenji, my dear, help me.
Wider again.
That's it.
That's really nice.
Pull your panties tight.
Pull them tight.
More.
More.
More.
Show your crotch.
Enough already.
I'm getting all wet.
OK.
Help.
Kenji.
Help me.
What are you doing?
You horny thing.
- Show me it.
- Show you what?
Silly.
No way.
What's that?
Naughty boy.
I bet you're always doing this with your wife?
I told you I'm not married.
And I don't feel like getting married either.
You're that sort of person?
That's the artists' sacrifice.
So...
What time does she get in?
We've still got four hours left.
Make me something tasty.
My stomach's empty.
I'm off home.
I've no wish to meet the other one.
Hey, what sort of person is your wife.
A nurse...?
Haven't I told you often enough, she's just some girl?
Isn't there anything I can trust you not to break?
Oi, Nami...
Who's that?
Mr Miyao?
It is, isn't it?
You're being very tough.
You shouldn't be drawing up charges and things.
Haven't I helped you in the past?
Because of what you've been saying on the phone, my wife's gone back to her hometown.
No more, please.
Hello.
Boss... sorry...
Good morning.
Yes.
Yes.
That's correct...
OK.
What's this about being fired?
So the charges...
But most of these things could happen to just about anybody.
Huh...
Why...?
Eh?
It's Muraki speaking,
We're not at home at the moment, Please leave your message,
Are you still alive, you robbing scum?
You're going to be dead.
How stupid!
The fact that I took care of three million yen won't stop me.
I just need to get it together.
I'm gonna overcome this crisis, otherwise my life will be...
Bad luck follows me around.
This time it's manslaughter.
Tsuchiya, Nami.
And these are her details.
It's no fun keeping a corpse company.
Yes?
Kangyo Finance.
Ohkawa speaking.
This is...
Muraki.
Ah.
Is the boss around?
The receptionist insists that he's away on a business trip.
You still there...
Ohkawa?
What do you think you're doing...?
Contact the police straightaway.
The scandal's putting a hard squeeze on us.
Hey, you.
My life's hit the rocks.
You've got it all wrong.
Wait.
Please wait!
Please wait!
Are you all right?
Please listen to what I've got to say.
No!
I understand.
I'm not going to do you harm.
Get away.
Don't come any closer.
Is that how you provide help?
There are good hospitals around.
Why didn't you try them?
Why?
Why are you like this?
What if I were to die?
You really hate me that much?
Don't mess with me.
I'm not gonna let it finish like this.
Do you know how much profit I made for the company?
The customers thought highly of me.
I lived a life of stress on their behalf.
Nothing else... that's how it was.
Don't take me for a fool.
Who am I...?
What do you think I am?
This is me.
This is me.
This is me.
I'm not gonna let it finish like this.
Shit!
I can't get it up.
I can't.
I can't!
Shit.
I can't.
I can't.
Maybe... I didn't want to sleep alone
I just wanted to be next to you.
Even somebody who was unconscious.
Maybe.
But that's not correct.
Maybe lt's wrong...
I wanted to have sex... I thought... if I could have sex it might end my run of bad luck.
I'm a selfish person.
I'm so sorry.
Can you forgive me?
Don't touch.
I'll take you on.
I'll publish everything you did.
It'll tear your life into little pieces.
You think of me as a thing.
What sort of things do you think people are?
Men don't feel for living creatures.
That's why I won't forgive you.
Things are hard for me.
The electricity's still on.
Maybe this is a biker's club.
Maybe this is where they put on the discos.
Good evening... this is room service.
I brought you your dinner.
What do you say?
I remembered I'd bought this.
You haven't eaten a thing since morning.
Eat something.
I found this.
You can find a lot things here around here.
There's enough of civilization here.
We could set up home...
Until they discover us.
Whatever you say, there's the blessing of not having a phone.
It's certainly raining.
It's been non-stop since our meeting this morning.
It will never stop.
My wife vanished.
People have hounded me.
Haven't they just?
I'm a stockbroker...
I sell stocks.
I was trading 100 or 200 million yen everyday, I lost all perspective about money...
When I realized, I embezzled customers' money and put it in my own account.
Before I realized it I'd accounted a big debt.
I got fired for doing this.
The customers threw stones at me they chased me and I ran away... I felt as if every single person in the world was chasing after me.
I was looking back in fear all the time.
Then I realized you were in front of me and... bang.
Sorry, it doesn't answer why I did what I did to you in the car...
When I found out that you were alive, my head was spinning... I had one thought that for the first time in my life...
Look here.
It's a cassette player.
Is it going to work?
No, it's not.
The battery's gone moldy.
Aren't you eating?
Don't you like the smell?
What's up?
Have you developed an appetite?
Once you fill up, you may feel like having a chat.
I need a pee.
You still haven't forgiven me?
I see you haven't.
After what I've done it's too much to ask.
Hey, although you were unconscious for a long time you really, really didn't see a thing.
I can take a rest from work here.
I haven't slept for 6 years.
In the end I fell into a deep sleep.
I may be wrong-headed, but I'm not a bad man.
If you would forgive me...
When we're back in Tokyo I could do something, not much, but if I could...
- I'm not going back.
- What?
There's nowhere for me to go back to.
I've been dragged through the gutter.
I don't feel right.
If I could get into a warm bath that's all I'd want.
What do you say?
That's great... should we go?
Would a motel somewhere do?
I'd wait outside.
When you look like that, you're beautiful.
In the meantime I'll buy you clothes.
OK?
Don't think I've forgiven you yet.
There aren't many around here but this might suit us.
I bought you panty hose.
Thanks.
The old man at the store gave me a strange look.
They don't normally find someone like me buying women's underwear.
Funny old man.
Once I've paid for this, I have left...
I'm going to have to use my cards.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
I'd like to wash my hair, too.
- Will you?
- There.
We may as well.
Well, that's the way things are.
Hey, why don't you tell me about yourself.
I don't know your name.
Or why early that morning you were walking along with an apron in your pocket.
Are you going to let me in on it?
You're a young wife.
You're off to buy the morning miso and tofu.
Sorry, just joking.
We didn't get married.
I'm a nurse.
I see.
My work finished early.
I was tired, on the way home.
You're telling lies.
Your old man had brought back a woman.
Not having slept, I felt dizzy.
No details remain I've forgotten everything.
Sorry... that's enough... sorry.
My patients... wanted to rape me.
And... when I got home.
The man I'd trusted the most I was wrong... I was hit by a car and then assaulted.
I was assaulted not just once or twice, but three times in one day.
Sorry.
Do you mind if I come inside you?
I don't want to go back to Tokyo.
Let's just go from place to place.
Us two going together.
Well... that's just great.
You up?
Thanks a lot.
Does it suit me?
Has something happened?
Does it look nice?
Yeah. I meant to get up before 6.
To get some cash out...
on my credit card.
I'm sorry.
You bought this to give me a present.
I've hardly...
Why not go home?
Someone who's used to playing with fortunes... can't let this get him down.
You can't give up.
Let me look after this.
Wow, I feel good.
Hey.
Hey.
Mmmm?
An air conditioned place, en suite, where you can do what you want...
where could you find a hotel like that?
What?
Is that right?
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
You dope.
How about that?
We're out of gas.
I'm sorry...
I didn't think.
Should we go home?
Get a taxi and use a cheque?
There, there.
We've still got a gas can.
Wasn't there a gas station?
Yeah, I'm sure there was.
I'll try using my legs.
Wait here.
I don't mind... going home.
What did you say?
We won't be able to get cash tomorrow.
Without a car...
I'm going.
I'll come with you.
Please, wait right here.
- Hey.
- Mmm?
Nothing.
What's wrong with that Merc?
If you get a gang of bikers coming around...
You'll come down from the sky and save me.
Just leave it to me.
Down from the sky or across the ocean in one jump.
Be quick.
No good, eh?
You've been very sympathetic.
Whereabouts is it?
A way back there.
Cheer up, I'll take you back down.
You sure?
You're a great help.
I'll get the car.
Whereabouts are we heading?
Let's see...
Turn right into the road, and then...
- Come on.
Come on.
Stop.
- Thanks.
Oi, oi, hang on a minute.
Get something and wipe this mark off.
What was that?
I told you to wipe it.
Didn't you just mark it?
You think I marked it?
I said you marked it, didn't I?
Sorry. I was in a rush.
What's going on?
What did you do?
Eh?
Get in... or stay by yourself!
Nami.
Nami.
If I go back.
I'll separate myself from him.
I'll look for an apartment.
Finally, it'll be work, work, work.
I'll give it my best shot.
He never came back, did he?
So, that's the end of that.
It works.
I'm on my own again...
Well, will it be alright?

What d'you think about those hotshot jitterbugs?

No way.

What'd you say you did for a living?
I'm a guardian of masculinity, man.
- (cop) Somebody smells good!
- Where does that put you?
- (cop) Where the fuck is my gun?
- Fuck.
We want a uniformed presence out in the street.
They're flying their colours, we're flying ours.
I want them to know who they're dealing with.
They got uzis.
They got shotguns.
They got explosives.
They got access to any weapon they want within 24 hours.
We got over 50,000 gangbangers out there.
We're bleeding from open wounds.
We're just jamming you 24 in to stop the flow.
We sound like a bunch of Tampax.
What?
You wanna tell me what you were saying?
uh...
I said we sound like a bunch of Tampax, sir.
Kid's cute.
Tampax goes someplace good.

- Give this guy to Hodges.

A little warlock, house of Blood set.
Apparently, at least two blacks drive by in a van, say "Hey, Blood." Boom.
Shit.
She saw it.
(Mrs Craig walls)
Ex cuse me.
- I ain't seen nothin'.
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Nothin'!
- Ma'am, if you saw this, you can't...
Who can't?
Just get on out of my face.
Are you gonna just close your eyes every time this happens?

- Let's go, let's go.
She has to live here.
(Mrs Craig) No, please!
(Mrs Craig) No!
He can't die!
He can't die!
D'you need anything?
Jeez, I don't know, Hodges.
Maybe some of your valuable expertise.
I doubt it.
You guys are doin' such a fine job, that's why they call us out at 2am.
Hey, why don't you flyin' CRASH guys go take a flyin' fuck?
Hey, fuck you.
- Fuck you.

There's too many bodies around here.

No!

Whether it was drugs or gang related, I don't know.
For now, let's hook and book.
Be inventive.
Find some probable cause.
Get both gangs off the street, at least for a night or two.
Let 'em calm down.
See if they'll talk.
What I need is a shot of Demerol and some clean sheets.
Whoa, whoa.
Any further questions?
- No, sir.
- All right.
Let's rock'n'roll.
- Stand up.
Keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

That ain't my job.

Nice ride, man.
I didn't make it.
- Why you sneakin' up on us like that?
- You wanna get back on the sidewalk?
- You're all buffed out.
Been to the joint?
- Just County.
Missed you for a while.
You out on good time?

Oh, this here's my Hopalong Cassidy rag.

Get some for us.
Yeah, you bet.
Hey, later on, Hodges.
Take care of yourself, homeboy.

Man!

Get lost.
Go home.

Go home!
Go on!
Bring him out here, McGavin.
Homes, what d'you think I'm gonna find when I look under that car, huh?
Huh?
You don't run from the fastest white boy on two feet.
Oh, man, you smell good, homes.
What is that?
Eau de doo-dah-day?
I saw him toss it.
What the hell were you runnin' for?
Answer me, asshole.
Answer me.
What's your name?
- What's your name?
- Clarence Brown.
- Don't lie to me.
- Clarence Brown.
- How old are you?
- 18.
How old are you?
14.
What else do they call you?
What's your name on the street?
Give me another name.
- High Top.
- Why do they call you that?
You a second-storey man, High Top?
You go down on basketball players?
What do you hang out with this loser for?
Wanna be like him?
You do, don't you?
No.
- What's your heart beatin' for?

I thought you were runnin' a marathon.

You're dead.
- You on parole or probation?
- No.
Well, I got you on my file now.
If I catch you here again, I'm gonna shove this up your ass.
How would that feel?
uncuff him.
uncuff him.
You heard me.
- I'm Hodges.
Ask around who I am.
- Yeah.
- You owe me one, OK?
- Yeah.
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.
Say it.
- I owe you one.
- OK.
Get outta here.
This alley is hot.
It's no longer yours, it's mine.
If I catch you here again, I'm gonna arrest you.
Be straight with me, I'll be straight with you.
Now, all of you, get lost.
Let's go.
Come on.
Out!
- Come on, man.
Let's go.
- Go on.
- We'll get him round the corner.
- Right on.
I'm down for that.
I'll drive.
- What the fuck was that?
- What?
I made a righteous collar back there, partner.
If I do something, I expect you to back me up and I hope you expect the same.
Oh.
You don't even know the area, yet you wanna drag him in for a pissy little rock and spend the rest of the shift doin' paperwork?
Is that a plan?
- You wanna hear a plan?
I got a plan.
- Yeah.
We get him for rock, then for somethin' else, and when he does something serious, it's not a first fuckin' offence!
(dispatcher) Male causing disturbance at parking lot, corner of 9th and Figueroa.
Shit.
OK, that's your plan.
All right.
Now you wanna hear mine?
You're full of fuckin' adrenaline, man.
You know...
You're not chasing' around Mickey Mouse crimes any more.
Now, the plan as I see it is to get to know these guys, so then when somethin' big does come along...
You wanna listen or what?
What?
You wanna look at pussy or learn about this job?
Which is it?
You heard the one about the two bulls?
Not yet.
Not yet, huh?
These two bulls are sittin' on a knoll overlooking' a herd of Guernseys, and the baby bull says "Hey, Pop, let's run down and fuck one of those cows."
But the papa bull says "No, Son."
"Let's walk down."
"Fuck 'em all."
(dispatcher) Unit 15, what is your location?
- When d'you get outta jail?
- (chuckles) What?
I could put a word in with Parole.
- What's your name?
- Louisa.

Hi, Danny.
So you get time off for good behaviour?
You ever go out with a cop?
You don't like cops, do you?
No.
- No what?
- No sale.
Let's go.
Yeah, sure.
I will be back.
I really love... your coffee, Louisa.
Bye.
Bye.
- You're jealous.
- That's right.
But I got a wife at home whom I love, and three kids.
- Yeah, well, that don't mean shit.
- That's why I'm jealous.
You don't wanna get laid, man.
It leads to kissin', and pretty soon you gotta talk to 'em.
White Fence are the oldest gang in LA.
There's three or four generations.
I don't know if you remember - they threatened that lady DA last year.
- (McGavin)?
Que pasó, homes?
- What's up?
- (McGavin) Nice ride.
- Hodges, what's happenin'?
Not much.
You still smokin' that PCP?
Make you stupid, man.
No, I don't fuck with juice.
This is weed.
Peewees smoke that shit.
I don't.
You seen any... gang members around?
Who, me?
I ain't seen any gang members.
You seen any gang members?
Check these vatos.
(police dispatcher on radio)
- 21st Street on our list?
- Nah.
Poor fuckers are professional victims.
Get their ass kicked constantly.
Kind of a mixed gang.
You got Diamond Street there, the Ville, and the projects on the west.
So they gotta fight their way in and fight their way out.
- They're fucked, huh?
- They are fucked.
- (thud)
- Jesus!
What're you gonna do?
Stand in the street and wave your fist?

Hey, get your hands outta your pockets.
Put your hands behind your neck.

Are you guys stupid or what?
Throwin' rocks at our car...
This is my office.
What are you, crazy?
Get your hands up.
Gimme your fingers, man.
Spread your legs.
Wider.
Spread your fuckin' legs, homes.
Who threw the rock?
Oh.
We can have it any way you want.
You wanna have an understanding?
Are we gonna have some kind of rapport or what?
- What's that?
- Cigarettes.
- You have any fuckin' primos in there?
- Chale, homes.
OK, get out.
What do you wanna have?
- Hodges, still with that rapport shit, huh?
- Hey.
How you doin'?
What's my little brother doin' up in that tree?
- Thinks he's a monkey vato, eh?
- Stay up there.
You heard the man.
- Little brother?
- Sí, mon.
What's your name, little brother?
- Tell him your name, homes.

OK, Larry.
Get over there.
Larry Sylvester.

What's the matter with the peewees, homes?
- What?
- They threw a rock at my brand-new car.
Who threw the rock?
Who threw it?
!
- You're a stupid fuck, you know that?
- No future in it, homie.
- So you're back in the jungles, homes?
- This ain't the jungle.
This is Disneyland.
So how we gonna teach them?
I don't know, Hodges.
I don't know, man.
I don't know about this younger generation, homes.
You come down, Felipe.
I'm gonna beat your ass.
Well, keep the homeboys in line, all right?
Yes, sir.
Have a good day.
All right, homes.
I didn't mean to jump on your case, it's just you were blowin' my deal.
Our community have kids out there who are dying over colours.
I mean, actually dying over red or blue.
And what we need is your help.
We need you to testify when you see something going on out there.
We're outnumbered, we're outgunned, we're tired.
We need your help.
You mean the cops don't have enough guns?
Shit!
- You wanna know why they pull this shit?
- Cos there ain't no jobs out there!
Hell with 'em all!
Throw all the motherfuckers in jail, huh?
I know all about bein' outgunned, all right?
I mean, I was in Vietnam.
Yeah!
It ain't about what you got in your hand.
It's about what the people want.
That's what it is, man.
You're doggone right that's what it is.
- It's what the people want.
- Wait.
Let the man talk, all right?
I used to run with a gang, all right?
Now I work with 'em.
I just wanna make a point here.
The reality on the streets is the dope dealer has the Mercedes-Benz, the money and the women.
Now, these kids have eyes.
They see what's goin' on.
And that is their socialisation.
It's the values that they respect.
We don't educate 'em.
We don't give 'em jobs.
We know all that.
Why don't you do somethin' about it?
Look, what we need is some damn protection.
- Then you've got to get involved.
- Why the fuck d'you think we're here?
We're fed up!
We're sick of this shit!
The police are never gonna get anywhere.
Shakin' people down, shining' their lights in our eyes.
Treatin' all of us like criminals cos of where we live!
- And right in front of our kids!

Fuck you!

I want to thank Miss Loretta Thomas and her choir, greet the congregation and all the rest of you who have chosen to grace our church on this special day.
What makes this day so special?
"What is so special?" you ask.
Another black boy bites the dust to which thou art returned.
I knew this boy, this Robert Craig, whose mama brought him up as best she could.
- It wasn't lack of love that killed him.
- (choir) Amen!
It was the scourge of drugs and gangs.
(congregation) That's right.
And what makes this day so special is, we have now declared war upon this plague!
Yeah!
Till we see that this scourge of gang violence is driven from our streets!
We've been bullied too long by these sawed-off gangsters.
These gangbangers, as they call themselves.
And now it is time for decent folk,...
- ...for people of God, to start bangin' back.
- Amen!
- Are we afraid of these hoodlums?
- (congregation) No.
- I said, are we afraid?
- No!
(automatic fire)
They hit, goddamn it!
We have a black and white following a black Ford LTD.

Keep this motherfucker goin'!
Fuckin' asshole!
Get outta Dodge, you motherfuckers.

says she wants to meet you.
She says, uh,...
- ...you can bring a date.
- Thanks.
- Jesus Christ!
- (Hodges chuckles)
So we had Linda, you know.
She's 18 now, right?
And then Bobby said "Well, why don't we try for a boy?"
So I thought Tommie for sure was gonna be our last one, but...
- (baby gurgles) - ...these things happen!
Well, they better not.
Oh, no.
You heard what he said?
Jumbo shrimp!
There's a contradiction.
- $14.95 a pound.
- Bobby...!
Hey, he's my partner.
What's money to two highly paid professionals of LA's best?
Right?
- Right.
- Let me go help you.
- No, honey.
Sit down.
- It's OK.
I'll just come.
Later, dear.
Prick.
Bastard.
You dog.
You better treat her right, or her Mexican mama's gonna chop it off.
- A fuckin' angel.
- I know.
Pretty fancy drivin' the other day, McGavin.
I mean, we didn't have to try and catch 'em.
Are you sayin' I wouldn't have?
Well, if I was you, a year before pension, a wife like that, a kid...
Three kids.
That's bullshit.
D'you wanna get into this now?
I don't understand you.
I really don't.
You wanna psychoanalyse me?
- Where'd you get your fuckin' hard-on?
- Ask me if I loved my mother.
I used to get jacked up cos I thought I needed that edge.
Well, maybe you don't, maybe I do.
Maybe we're just different.
What I remember most from that time is nothing but regrets.
Let me tell you something: you can't prove anything out on the streets.
What you do is a job.
You can try to be a professional - that's the best you can do.
Now in 19 years I've learned one thing.
If you try to fight every jerk on the street, you'll be one sad, sorry son of a bitch.
And you'll never last 20 years.
And God forbid if you ever get married and take it out on your wife.
She will walk.
She will fucking leave you.
So why make it worse all the time?
- Is that one thing?
- Yeah, one thing.
It's all one thing.
- The other day...
- This isn't to do with that.
- Shut up!
uh, do I get to talk?
- Talk.
I'm sorry about the car.
I fuckin' wiped out.
What can I say?
You want me to say it's not gonna happen again?
I know what you're saying and trying to do, but I didn't volunteer for CRASH to play games and be nice to these assholes.
Think you get respect?
They laugh and fuck somebody up.
I can't deal with that.
If you don't think you can deal with me, well, I understand that, too.
- Well?
- (Louisa) What?
- So tell me about him.
- Well, I will tell you later.
- Gimme the baby.
Louisa?
- No, it's all right.
I enjoy it.
How do you want me to cook those shrimp?
Oh, butterfly 'em.
What's up?
Nothin'.
You OK?
Yeah.
- (Tommie) Here I come!
- Look at your brother there.
Look.
(playful growls)
(McGavin) Now look what I got.

What the fuck you mean, what you gonna do, man?
Who the fuck sent you anyway, homes?
- Hodges.
- Hodges?
!
Yeah, he thinks maybe you're smart enough to walk away from this bullshit.
- But you're too stupid to realise it.
- What does Hodges know, man?
Huh?
Fuck Hodges, man!
Where does Hodges come from anyway, huh?
See, man, these are my homeboys, vato.
See, our homie here is all we have, man.
I love them...
They love me back, man.
Mi barrio es primero, man.
(grunts)
D'you want me to walk away from this, man?
No way.
Fuck you.
No way, man.
You can stop over there.
(clears throat)
I had a nice time.
Thank you.
Hey.

- Look over here.
Where?
Closer.
What?
Lookin' pretty good.
I like you, too.
I didn't say that.
Tough guy, huh?
You know, everybody around here is so tough that that doesn't get to me.
What does?
Be nice.
- Wanna tell me what you were thinking?
- No. uh... no!
OK.
I'm gonna go then.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll drive you down.
This is a bad area.
- I'll bring you down.
- Danny, I'm a homegirl.
This is my barrio, remember?
I'm safe.

I noticed all those gangbang assholes driving' fire extinguishers off the docks.
I couldn't figure out why they was so concerned about puttin' out a fuckin' fire.
So I'm checkin' out the fire extinguishers, and it goes off in my hands.
They put the coke in the holes, you know?
So the evidence gets destroyed.

I don't have any problem with you.
Oh, no?
You got problems with the whole fuckin' world, and I'm in it.
And I don't like it.
Why don't you just chill out a little bit and figure out which side you're on?
I would if I could.
But you're just like them, Pac-Man.

Well, thank you.
Will you just tell me what I did?
They hate you, McGavin.
McGavin?
Oh.
You see that badge?
I wear it.
That's my job.
That's what I do.
So what do you want?
The other day you caught this boy and put paint all over his face.
Well, he's my cousin.
Oh, that's funny?
I didn't know you had such a big family.
I'm sorry.
OK?
I'm sorry.
You know what he was doin'?
He was crossing out the names of East LA gang members on the wall.
You know what that means when they do that?
It means they're gonna kill someone.
So I'm sorry if I sprayed the kid's face.
Maybe I saved his life that way.
- But I swear...
- I don't care!
That's mean, Danny.
You're sadistic.
I am not with you.
I am with them, Danny.
I'm a homegirl.
Did they threaten you?
No.
No one knows I saw you.
It's you who threaten me, Danny.
You have a mean heart.
What's up?
What can I do for you?
- Thanks for comin' by.
- I called you because Felipe's got...

He ain't in no gang.
Barrio don't need him, homes.
Hodges, I'm telling you this.
You gotta get him off the computer file, homes.
Well, he's gonna have to go to Juvie Hall anyway.
Might do him some good.
Scare him a little.
Ah, he's scared.
He's scared of what I'm gonna do, homes.
Listen, get him out of the gang file.
You'll fuck up his life sure as I live, homes.
I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to him, OK?
Orale!
I know the routine, homes.
I owe you one.

I wanna apologise.
- For what?
- For a lotta shit.

I mean, I'm not the guy for that.

I have.
You do.

I'll be gettin' a new partner first of the month.
You ever have a bad relationship with a woman where you fight all the time?
Even when you love 'em.
It's like havin' two heads.
One says "red", the other's sure to say "green".
Once you had one that wasn't like that, you never go back again.
You leave it.
You don't point a finger and blame someone.
You just go your separate ways.

I lent it to my brother.
And?
Rocket took it from him at a party.
He just took the van?
My brother was afraid.
He's more afraid of Rocket than of you?

What about the woman, Officer Baines?
Was she in the line of fire?
Not to my knowledge.
She wasn't hit.
Your knowledge of our shooting policy is the question here, Officer Baines, because your judgment is certainly suspect.
You killed a man, mister - for reaching' for his pants.
Sir, I thought my life and the lives of my fellow officers were in danger.
- He appeared to be going for a weapon.
- I do understand that, Officer Baines.
But what I can't figure out is why you didn't take more time to find out who was really in that room.
Sir, we thought the 187 murder suspect was in the room.
That's why we were there.
You thought wrong, Officer Baines.
Man, this is crazy.
They think he shot him.
- It wasn't you, was it?
- No, sir.
What difference does it make?
If they think he did, he did it.
They're not gonna shoot a cop.
- Who told you this?
- I'd rather not say.
I'm not asking you to testify.
I'm not gonna give up your source.
Leo Lopez.
Call him Frog.
He's in County on a traffic warrant.
He owed me one, OK?
- Look, I believe him.
- I'm sick of these dumb assholes.
Call Metro.
Put the clamps on until we get 'em to call it off.
- Melindez, you wanna set it up?
- Yeah.
Sure.
What we gonna do with him?
Ex cuse me.
If you wanna take me off the street, that's your option.
But we shouldn't let these gangbangers dictate the way we operate.
I'll be OK.
What do you think?
I'll call Metro when I get upstairs.
In the meantime, kick back.
Relax, tú sabes?
And be careful.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
I'm back after lunch.
Fuck it, man!
They're still out there, dude, asking' about the hit on Pac-Man.
- (Crip) Say what?
- (Crip #2) No shit.
- Who said?
- I saw 'em rollin' down the street!
(Crip) Bullshit, shit!
- Y'all been talkin'?
- Hell, no!
- Is everybody here?
- No.
T-Bone, cuz. up in County, man.
Word.
- Y'all find out who that nigger with.
- T-Bone say Frog from 21st Street.
- Let's bust a cap in his ass.
- Get his hide.

Your brother paid.
I got him a job, remember?
Shit!
Well, he shouldn't have paid, homes.
- It's just money, man.
- I know, but he shouldn't have paid.
§ Went up to Miss Mousie's door

I don't know why, man.
Did you see how many people were in the car?
I didn't see anything.

You're all fired up, man.

Hey, what you gettin' moody for?

Just shut up, all right?
Listen.
There were these two, uh, bulls and they're standin' on top of a mountain.
And, uh... um they're lookin' down at a bunch of cows.
And then, uh, the older one says to the younger one...
No!
The younger one...
The younger one says...
"Hey, Pop."
"What do you say we run down and fuck one of them cows?" And, uh...
And then the older one says "No, son."
"Let's walk down and fuck 'em all."
