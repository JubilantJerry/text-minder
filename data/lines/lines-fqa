Perhaps fear made them go back instead of forward.
- And you felt no fear?
- No. I have nothing to lose.
No home ... family?
Do you have a profession?
- l live by my sword.
- You fight for pay.
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
I knew I could do it. so I did it.
Well.
Lancelot ...
you´re an unusual man.
I´ve never seen such a display of courage, skill, nerve, grace and ... stupidity.
Come.
Here, every life is precious, even the lives of strangers.
If you must die, die serving something greater than yourself.
Better still.
live ... and serve.
- The Round Table.
- Yes.
The High Council meets here.
No head. no foot.
Everyone equal ... even the King.
"ln serving each other, we become free."
That is the very heart of Camelot.
Not these stones. timbers.
towers, palaces.
Burn them all ...
and Camelot lives on.
Because it lives in us.
It´s a belief we hold in our hearts.
Well. no matter.
- Stay in Camelot. I invite you.
- l´ll be on the road again soon.
- What road?
- Wherever chance takes me.
Do you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?
- Yes.
- ln that hallway are two doors.
- How will you choose between them?
- lt won´t matter. lt´s all chance.
I hope chance leads you to the left.
It´s the only way out.
Lancelot!
Just a thought ...
A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing.
And if you love nothing, what joy is there in your life?
I may be wrong.
Peter!
Show us how she goes.
- She´s yours.
- She´s beautiful.
Peter thinks she´s not suitable for a lady.
- l would have chosen her myself.
- l know.
- How do you know?
- Remember when you joined our hunt?
- You were fearless.
- My father´s word was "reckless".
He was always sparing with praise.
Come.
- We could almost be alone here.
- Do you have secrets to tell me?
No.
No secrets.
Just a question to ask.
Do you want to marry me?
You don´t have to marry me because your father wanted it.
Camelot will protect Leonesse, whether you marry me or not.
Thank you.
You don´t know what it means to me to hear you say that.
Do you want to be released from the engagement?
No. I want to marry you.
Not your crown or your army or your golden city.
Just you.
- Just me?
- Yes. lf you love me.
- Do you remember this?
- You hurt it in the hunt.
- l didn´t think you´d get a scar.
- Just a scratch.
You wiped the blood away with a sleeve of your dress.
The sleeve still carries the stain.
I never thought until then how sweet it must be to be loved by one woman.
And for the first time in my life, I wanted ...
- What?
- What wise men say doesn´t last.
What cannot be promised, or made to linger any more than sunlight.
But I don´t want to die. without having felt its warmth on my face.
Marry the King, Guinevere, but love the man.
I only know one way to love.
And that is body ... and heart ...
and soul.
I kiss the hurt that brought me your love.
Try her.
- Shall I fetch a lady´s saddle?
- No need.
- She´s a rare beauty, sire.
- Yes. she is.
So is the mare.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, and the strength to make it endure.
As you all know, I am soon to be married.
- And about time. too.
- Hear!
We have had our share of war.
Now, I look forward to quieter days.
But first, admit our guest.
- Malagant ...
- Malagant is here at my invitation.
May I congratulate the King on his forthcoming marriage.
I see my place hasn´t been taken yet.
- l was first among your knights.
- You left of your own free will.
We each of us must follow our own road.
Where does your road take you?
To Leonesse?
Leonesse is my neighbour. I offered the lady a treaty of friendship.
- ls burning villages friendship?
- Yes, My Lady ...
Your land is becoming lawless.
Were you not just attacked?
- You know who attacked me.
- l made it my business to know.
- Justice has been done.
- You know no law above yourself!
"Armed forces to be given access to all Leonesse."
"Troops to assist in the enforcement of law ... in all Leonesse."
- Do you want to sign this?
- l´ll never sign it.
She´s very brave ...
now she´s to be married.
- Will Camelot protect Leonesse?
- ls Leonesse in need of protection?
Come.
Arthur.
I´m here to settle this business.
Leonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let´s say half each.
The lesser gives way to the greater.
What nation is greater than Camelot?
The land ofjustice.
Come ... your hand on it.
We´Il all live together as friends.
You offer me what isn´t yours to give.
You all know me.
You know I´m a man of my word.
Don´t make an enemy of me.
- l mean no harm to Camelot.
- You know the law we live by.
Where is it written.
beyond Camelot live lesser people?
People too weak to protect themselves, let them die?
Other people live by other laws.
Or does your law rule the world?
There are laws that enslave men.
and laws that set them free.
Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God. or we´re just a robber tribe.
Your words are talking you out of peace and into war.
There´s a peace you only find after war.
If that battle must come.
I will fight it!
- And I!
- And I!
The great Arthur ...
and his great dream.
No dream lasts forever.
- What is the status of the army?
- Four battalions. two in reserve.
- l´ll double the watch.
- l don´t think Malagant wants war.
Arm the reserves.
He wants war.
- He wants Leonesse as a buffer.
- He wants Camelot.
- How soon could he attack?
- His army is five days´ march away.
So much for my quieter days.
Who approaches there?
I come with a message for Lady Guinevere!
Enter.
- My Lady, it´s Jacob.
- Where?
- Coming to the north gate.
- Leonesse ...
Jacob ...
- Mind the step.
- Jacob. what is it?
They´ve taken Lady Guinevere!
Taken?
Taken where?
A boat, sire.
From the north gate into the forest.
I have scouts and dogs out already.
Give me a battalion of guards.
- Give me the men.
- No, that´s exactly what he wants.
- Take one brigade, now!
- Sire.
He´ll not harm her. sire.
She´s too valuable.
- He´ll try to trade her first.
- That´s what I´m afraid of.
I´d give my life for her.
But what if he asks for more?
Welcome to my palace ...
My Lady.
I think we can release the lady from her bonds.
If she so wishes.
What´s this?
Your dress is torn.
Ralph ... I gave orders that the lady was not to be harmed.
Your dress is quite spoiled.
You almost a queen.
ralph.
Did you do this?
- Yes, My Prince.
- You see?
This is what Arthur doesn´t understand.
Men don´t want brotherhood.
they want leadership.
Shall we?
This was once the greatest castle ever built.
Now grass grows in the halls where kings once feasted, and peasants cart away the walls to make shelters for their pigs.
- Such is glory.
- What do you mean to do with me?
Keep you till Arthur becomes reasonable.
He won´t trade Leonesse for my life.
I´d rather die.
Arthur knows that.
Self-sacrifice is very easy.
But sacrificing someone you love puts your convictions to the test.
I´m sure Arthur will come round to the merits of compromise.
This is called an oubliette.
That´s French for a place of forgetting.
Your quarters, My Lady.
No gates, no bars, no locks.
Just walls of air.
You can come out!
I´m unarmed and alone!
- Who are you?
- A messenger from the King.
- He came alone?
- Yes, My Prince.
- What is your message?
- ls Lady Guinevere unharmed?
She´s unharmed. I give you my word.
- l need to see it with my own eyes.
- My word isn´t good enough?
I´m a common man.
I don´t have much use for words.
He does have a message.
Take him to the pit, then bring him back.
- You´ve seen her.
Let´s go.
- No.
- l still have a message to deliver.
- all right.
We´ll drag you back.
Jump on!
Jump!
Come on!
Jump!
If the water can get out, so can we.
Come on.
No!
Hold on!
Shoot!
Why have we stopped?
- l´m tired.
- Never.
You battle in your dreams.
- What are you doing?
- You´ll see.
Now. drink.
Again.
- Where did you learn to do that?
- l lived most of my life outdoors.
Don´t you have a home?
No. I don´t have a home.
Not for a long time.
- That must be hard.
- Why must it be?
I´m my own master.
I go where l please.
Why build a house for the warlords to burn?
is that how it happened?
God save you from such a day.
How old were you?
Mother!
Father!
It was long ago.
- God save us all from such a day.
- He didn´t save me.
- Ah. but he did.
- For what?
It´s made you who you are.
A man who fears nothing and no one.
You can use that gift.
If not, you might as welI have died.
You don´t know how many times I´ve wished for that.
But you didn´t die.
You lived.
- Tell me what to do.
- Your life is your own.
I give it to you.
You forget I´m to be married.
If you could freely do as you pleased, would you marry Arthur?
- l am free.
As free as you are.
- Prove it.
- How?
- Forget who you are.
Let all the world go away ...
and all the people in it, but us.
Do what you want to do.
Here.
Now.
There she is!
Thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You can go.
You must have better things to do.
You have given me back my life.
I can at least give you your shirt.
- Tell me what you want. lt´s yours.
- l did what any man would do.
You risked your life for another.
There is no greater love.
You have deceived me.
But now ...
I know the truth.
You care nothing for yourself.
No wealth, no home, no goal, just the passionate spirit that drives you on.
God uses people like you.
Because your heart is open, you give all of yourself.
If you knew me better, you wouldn´t say such things.
I take the good with the bad.
I can´t love people in slices.
Now, no more protests.
Let me thank you in my own way.
They are welcoming you back.
We owe Lady Guinevere´s life to one man.
Lancelot.
I believe he comes to Camelot for a purpose, even though he doesn´t know it himself.
What I´m about to offer this man is already his.
One seat stands empty.
- You´d make him a knight, sire?
- l offer no life of privilege.
It´s a life of service.
If you want it, it´s yours.
- We don´t know anything about him.
- Perhaps we should discuss ...
Enough!
What do you say?
Will you join us?
My Lord, if I may speak?
I owe this man more than anyone here.
He deserves any honour you can give him.
But he doesn´t belong in Camelot.
He´s a man who goes his way alone.
In that freedom and solitude is his strength.
If you wish to honour him, as I do, with all my heart, -
- let´s honour him as he is.
Let him go, alone and free ...
and with our love.
Well ...
Lancelot?
Lady Guinevere understands me well.
But here, among you, l have found something that I want more than freedom.
It would break my heart to leave you.
Bravo!
Then you´ll join us?
- Yes.
- Welcome.
This is only the beginning.
Go pass this night in prayer, for tomorrow you´ll be born again, into a new life.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Please leave Camelot.
- l want to be where you are.
You must not say such things to me.
Say nothing.
I will leave Camelot now.
if you come with me.
- No.
- Then tell me you don´t love me.
I don´t love you.
Arise.
Sir Lancelot.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death ... I swear to love and serve Guinevere.
my true and rightful queen.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere.
and to protect her honour as my own.
Jacob ...
Forgive me, milady.
Black Malagant has taken Leonesse.
Leonesse ...
The gates are open.
- Make camp for the night.
- Where. sire?
There.
It´s too exposed. sire.
We could never possibly defend it.
Sire.
They´re not here.
There´s no one here!
Draw!
Loose!
Charge!
Attack!
- Archers in position, sire.
- Hold position.
- Their left wing is falling back.
- Second battalion to the left!
is our centre holding?
Charge!
- They´re breaking, sire.
- Do not give chase.
- First battalion regrouped, sire.
- Sound the advance.
- They´re running.
Do we follow?
- No.
Let them go.
On to Leonesse!
Well done.
Your sword ...
Sir Lancelot.
No!
No!
- Come out.
- They´re alive.
You´re safe.
Don´t be afraid.
We´re glad you´re safe.
There´s a step.
Be careful.
God bless you, sir.
I´m so old now ...
Can I go home now?
Can I go home now?
Yes.
Yes, you can go home now.
Bless you, milady.
Elise ... I´ve come to say goodbye, and wish you well.
It´s been a long night.
You´ve not slept.
- Where will you go?
- Wherever the road leads.
When shall we see you again?
I don´t think I´ll be coming back.
Never?
Never.
I know what I must do now.
I never believed in anything before.
But I do believe in Camelot.
And I will serve it best by leaving.
Tell the King, I´ll always remember that he saw the best in me.
And what shall I tell myself?
There was once a man who loved you too much to change you.
I´ll not forget him.
I sheltered under a tree with him once ... in the rain.
Lancelot ...
- My Queen.
- l owe you a kiss.
I´m asking you.
Why?
Why?
The King asks for you, milady.
I ask you not to lie to me, even if you think you´ll hurt me.
- Have you given yourself to him?
- No, My Lord.
Do you love him?
Yes.
- How did I fail you?
- You´ve never failed me, My Lord.
I saw your face as you kissed him.
Love has many faces. I look on you differently, but not with less love.
When a woman loves two men.
she must choose between them.
- l choose you.
- Your will chooses me.
- Your heart chooses him.
- My will is stronger than my heart.
Do you think I put so high a price on my feelings?
They´ll pass.
My will holds me to my course through life.
As mine does me, and yet, all I have to do is look at you and everything I ever believed in fades to nothing.
- All I want is your love.
- You have it.
Do I?
Then look on me as you looked on him.
I gave one moment to Lancelot.
Yes, you´re innocent.
But you love him!
Any more of this innocence and I´ll go mad.
- l´ll do whatever you tell me to.
- l don´t know what to think.
I no longer see my way ahead.
Only fools dream of the one thing they can´t have.
Forgive me.
What´s to forgive?
I dreamed the dream of you.
It was a sweet dream while it lasted.
- Unlock the door.
- Sire.
- My Lord?
- l´ll ask the questions.
Did you come to Camelot to betray me?
- No, My Lord.
- You desired her.
You pursued her.
- The Queen is innocent.
- Innocent?
I saw her in your arms.
I trusted you, and you betrayed me.
- l never meant to hurt you.
- You leave me nothing!
Nothing!
You will be charged with treason.
Defend yourself in court.
The law will judge you!
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, and the strength to make it endure.
Amen.
I was mistaken in Lancelot.
As a man, I may forgive ...
As a king, I must see justice done.
There will be a trial tomorrow.
in the great square.
- ln the great square?
- Let´s settle the matter privately.
You think the honour of Camelot is a private matter?
Am I to hide in dark corners as if I´m ashamed?
Open the gates.
I want everyone there.
Let every citizen see that the law rules in Camelot.
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, Queen of Camelot. -
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, Queen of Camelot. and Lancelot.
Knight of the High Council, are charged in their own persons, and in collusion. with dishonour to the realm.
and violation of the King´s rights.
These crimes constitute an act of treason against Camelot, and the penalty under law is death.
- Sir Lancelot may speak.
- My words are for the King alone.
My Lord.
The Queen is innocent.
But if my life, or my death, serves Camelot.
Take it.
Do what you like with me.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and death.
is it the King´s wish that the Queen be questioned?
May God forgive me.
Is it the King´s wish that the Queen be questioned?
- Who goes there?
- Who goes there?
Guards!
Close the gates!
Nobody move or Arthur dies!
My men control the city gates.
On every roof, I have men with burning torches!
I have only to lift my arm, and your golden city burns to ashes.
I am the law now!
You obeyed Arthur.
Now, obey me.
My people are unarmed, Malagant.
If it´s me you want, here I am.
Look at him!
Look at the great King Arthur of Camelot.
He´s a man waking up from a dream.
The strong rule the weak!
That´s how your God made the world.
He makes us strong only for a while, so we can help each other.
My God makes me strong so I can live my life!
Arthur says, "Serve one another." When will you live your own lives?
This is the freedom I bring you!
Freedom from his tyrannical dream!
Freedom from his tyrannical law!
Freedom from his tyrannical God!
I want your people to see you kneel before me here.
Kneel before me. or die.
Too proud, Arthur?
Do you think you serve your people better dead?
I have no pride left in me.
What I do now.
I do for my people, and for Camelot.
And may they forgive me.
This is my last act as your king.
Do not be afraid.
All things change.
I am Arthur of Camelot.
I command you now, all to fight!
Fight!
Like you´ve never fought before!
No!
- Camelot lives!
- Burn everything!
No!
Be careful!
Come on!
Sword!
Camelot will never fall to the tyranny of Malagant!
- ls there no more we can do?
- l´m sorry.
- Lancelot ...
- Yes, My Lord?
- Where´s my sword?
- Here.
My truest ... my First Knight.
Camelot is your home now.
You are the future ...
The future of Camelot.
You take care of her for me.
Take care of her.
I feel it now, my love.
The sunlight.
It´s in your eyes.
English subtitles - lft
Good.
Do you want to know how to win?
Be the only one with a sword.
Easy.
Give him a hand!
He fought well!
Well done.
John.
Winner takes all, my friends!
One more challenger and I'll leave.
Once in a lifetime, you meet a man so fearless.
No man can touch him.
While you're waiting for him, you can practice on me.
As sure as the sun will rise.
There's a man who's better than me.
He could be here.
It could be today.
Yeah!
It could be you.
- He looks strong.
Is he good?
- Try him and see!
Go on.
Mark.
But don't hurt him.
So, you're Mark, are you?
I'm Lancelot.
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.
You don't have to kill me to win.
- Got tight hold of your sword?
- Don't you worry about that!
Can I give you some advice?
Don't drop your sword.
Is this your sword?
Give him a hand!
- Well done.
Mark!
- How did you do that?
- Was that a trick?
- No.
That's the way I fight.
Could I do it?
Tell me.
I can learn.
Study your opponent, so you know what he'll do before he does it.
- I can do that.
- And wait for the critical moment.
- I can do that.
- You can't care about your life.
Come on!
Quickly!
Shut the doors!
Where's Daddy?
Burn it down.
We'll be burnt alive!
We need water!
Get water!
- No!
Wait till they've gone!
- We'll be dead by then!
Malagant.
Last night, men from this village killed three of my people.
In reprisal, I have destroyed your village.
The borderlands have been lawless long enough.
Know now.
That I am the law!
Come on!
There she is.
Mind the dog!
- Come here, milady.
- Wait.
- Milady...
- I won't be much longer.
There's been another attack.
Another border village burnt.
Anne, take my place.
- Is it Malagant again?
- Yes.
A small group got away.
- Are they being looked after?
- They want to see you first.
No, no, please.
You poor people, after such a terrible journey.
We didn't know where else to turn, milady.
They say we're outlaws.
They say we crossed the border.
I know.
It's all lies.
He means to frighten us into submission.
- Don't give in to him.
We'll fight.
- I'm not the yielding kind.
Jacob.
Take these good people in and give them food and drink.
When you've rested, we shall pray for your village and for Leonesse.
- God keep you safe, milady.
- And you.
Now, go.
- It's the third village he's burnt.
- Does he want to destroy us all?
- He wants us to sign his treaty.
- He thinks we won't challenge him.
If he doesn't get what he asks, he has the power to take it.
Oswald...
You say nothing.
- You know what I think.
Child.
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Prince Malagant must be answered.
- He will be.
I shall decide today.
Now leave me.
Oswald, stay.
- I had hoped to have more time.
- Don't you know your own heart?
I know what I want.
I want to marry.
I want to live and die in Leonesse.
But I can't have everything I want, can I?
Forgive me, but an offer of marriage from Arthur of Camelot...
Yes.
I know.
You're right, of course.
No more words.
Let it be done.
- You accept the offer?
- I shall marry Arthur of Camelot.
I was so proud to hold you in my arms at your birth.
I shall be prouder still to see you wed.
Poor Arthur.
The only dowry I bring him is a land in danger.
- But I shall love him.
Oswald.
- You should.
Child.
I could never marry a man without love.
Arthur wears his power so lightly.
He has such gentleness in his eyes.
I've never known anyone like him.
How could I love anyone more?
Halt!
It could be an ambush.
Look to the trees!
Protect the carriage!
Don't break the line.
Wait!
Wait!
Now!
Follow!
Follow!
It's all right.
They're going.
Wait!
Watch your flank!
We've got to jump!
Come on.
Elise!
Roll when you hit the ground!
Petronella.
Come on!
You have to!
Hurry!
Save yourself!
It's me they'll follow!
She must have gone to ground.
She can't be far.
There!
Don't move.
- Who are you?
- Who cares?
Kill him!
- What is it?
- There were three.
Don't even breathe.
You... drop the sword.
- Can I have her when you're done?
- You were after the woman?
Of course.
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?
- I don't know about that.
- You don't want her?
Her soft skin, sweet lips...
young, firm body.
- I have my orders.
- Who's to know?
- I should take her back.
- I'll hold her for you.
- It won't take long.
- I don't want any trouble.
This one's no trouble.
Look at her.
She wants it.
- What's she doing?
- See for yourself.
Turn her around.
Look into her eyes.
See what she's got for you.
Hello, pretty.
Now... what have you got for me?
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Why did you risk your life for me?
They could have killed you.
I'm not that easy to kill.
Do you know who I am?
Guinevere.
I'm the Lady of Leonesse.
Well?
Doesn't it please you to know you saved the life of a lady?
- I'd be happy to save a dairy maid.
- She couldn't reward you.
If she were as pretty as you, she could.
- What did I do?
- You insulted me.
Now I've insulted you.
How dare you treat me like this?
I take it you know no better.
You have done me a good service and I shall forget the matter.
- Which way?
- I've never been here before.
- How do you know where the road is?
- I'm guessing.
See the scavenger birds?
They're looking for small animals crushed by the passing wagons.
- About this reward...
- My man will pay you.
- I don't want money.
- I'm on my way to be married.
Then you're not married yet.
You're free.
- I've given my word.
- I don't want your word.
- I want you.
- I'm not to be had for the wanting.
Why not?
If you want me.
- You may impress servant girls...
- I can tell when a woman wants me.
- I can see it in her eyes.
- Not in my eyes.
- You're afraid, aren't you?
- I have nothing to hide.
Then look at me.
If there is any honour in you, promise me never to do that again.
I don't know about honour.
But I promise you...
I won't kiss you again until you ask me to.
And that I never will.
- When do you get married?
- On Midsummer's Day.
Before Midsummer's Day dawns, you'll ask me to kiss you again.
- You insult me.
Then abandon me?
- That's the road ahead.
And that, I presume, is your brave escort.
- My child...
Thank the Lord.
- Are my ladies safe?
- Were you followed, milady?
- No.
No.
There's no one there.
Your new country awaits you.
- If anything should happen...
- I'll send word.
Never fear.
Send Jacob.
I want to know at once.
Good news or bad.
Promise me.
I promise you.
I promise you.
Lady Guinevere of Leonesse.
Welcome to Camelot.
God be praised, you're safe.
Nothing shall ever harm you again.
My Lord honours me with his kindness.
Your coming brings me a happiness I had not dared hope for.
My Lord must not think too highly of me, lest he'll be disappointed.
Then I'll take you as I find you, if you'll do as much for me.
Leonesse awaits news of your safety.
John will send any message you want.
My Lord grants my wishes before I speak them.
Tell my people I'm come safe into my new country.
Tell them you saw my eyes filled with tears of joy.
Already a queen.
- Agravaine, what happened?
- Ambush.
Sire.
- Malagant?
- It has to be.
- Was Lady Guinevere in danger?
- We were all in danger, sire.
There were two separate forces.
- Lady Guinevere was in danger.
- You weren't prepared for them?
So many fell in the first strike.
How could we guess they had a second force?
Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses, so long as he wins.
- I'll not fail you again, sire.
- We both know no one is perfect.
- But I need to know everything.
- Sire.
Come.
I first climbed this hill as a boy and saw what was to become my city.
I named it Camelot.
- It's so beautiful it frightens me.
- Why do you say that?
I was brought up to set no faith in finery.
"Beauty doesn't last", my father said.
I remember the way he looked at you.
I remember him saying, "Do all fathers think their daughters are so beautiful?"
He never said that to me.
Camelot.
Good girl...
Thank you!
You saved me from a long ride.
God knows when she'd have stopped.
- She's a fine animal.
- Fit for a queen.
- I'm Peter.
King's stableman.
- Lancelot.
Which king?
The King.
Arthur of Camelot.
This beauty is a gift for his bride.
People swore he would never marry, but I knew better.
He was just waiting for the right one.
Like we all do.
There'll be some feasting today!
Come on!
The party's started!
Beat the gauntlet and meet the King!
Who's got the heart of a lion?
Be the first to get through the gauntlet, and you'll be up there drinking, as if he's your brother!
Get up here!
Get padded up and beat the gauntlet!
What about you boys out there?
Give your support to this brave, young man!
Beat the gauntlet and meet our lovely queen!
Will you give the victor a kiss, milady?
Howw's that?
Beat the gauntlet and win a kiss from Lady Guinevere, soon to be our lovely queen!
Who will it be?
Not like that.
Idiot!
Come and get padded up first!
Get down!
You're mad!
You'll kill yourself!
Go on!
Yes!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
- Extraordinary.
What's your name?
- Lancelot.
Lancelot.
We won't forget that name.
Your prize...
- Ask me.
- No.
Ask me.
Never.
I dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
I only have one heart to lose.
Come.
Well done.
- Have you run the gauntlet before?
- No.
Never.
- How did you do it?
- You have to see the danger coming.
Others have found it very hard.
You're the first one to do it.
Perhaps fear made them go back instead of forward.
- And you felt no fear?
- No.
I have nothing to lose.
No home... family?
Do you have a profession?
- I live by my sword.
- You fight for pay.
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
I knew I could do it.
So I did it.
Well.
Lancelot...
you're an unusual man.
I've never seen such a display of courage, skill, nerve, grace and... stupidity.
Come.
Here, every life is precious, even the lives of strangers.
If you must die, die serving something greater than yourself.
Better still.
Live... and serve.
- The Round Table.
- Yes.
The High Council meets here.
No head.
No foot.
Everyone equal... even the King.
"In serving each other, we become free."
That is the very heart of Camelot.
Not these stones.
Timbers.
Towers, palaces.
Burn them all...
and Camelot lives on.
Because it lives in us.
It's a belief we hold in our hearts.
Well.
No matter.
- Stay in Camelot.
I invite you.
- I'll be on the road again soon.
- What road?
- Wherever chance takes me.
Do you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?
- Yes.
- In that hallway are two doors.
- How will you choose between them?
- It won't matter.
It's all chance.
I hope chance leads you to the left.
It's the only way out.
Lancelot!
Just a thought...
A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing.
And if you love nothing, what joy is there in your life?
I may be wrong.
Peter!
Show us how she goes.
- She's yours.
- She's beautiful.
Peter thinks she's not suitable for a lady.
- I would have chosen her myself.
- I know.
- How do you know?
- Remember when you joined our hunt?
- You were fearless.
- My father's word was "reckless".
He was always sparing with praise.
Come.
- We could almost be alone here.
- Do you have secrets to tell me?
No.
No secrets.
Just a question to ask.
Do you want to marry me?
You don't have to marry me because your father wanted it.
Camelot will protect Leonesse, whether you marry me or not.
Thank you.
You don't know what it means to me to hear you say that.
Do you want to be released from the engagement?
No.
I want to marry you.
Not your crown or your army or your golden city.
Just you.
- Just me?
- Yes.
If you love me.
- Do you remember this?
- You hurt it in the hunt.
- I didn't think you'd get a scar.
- Just a scratch.
You wiped the blood away with a sleeve of your dress.
The sleeve still carries the stain.
I never thought until then how sweet it must be to be loved by one woman.
And for the first time in my life, I wanted...
- What?
- What wise men say doesn't last.
What cannot be promised, or made to linger any more than sunlight.
But I don't want to die.
Without having felt its warmth on my face.
Marry the King, Guinevere, but love the man.
I only know one way to love.
And that is body... and heart...
and soul.
I kiss the hurt that brought me your love.
Try her.
- Shall I fetch a lady's saddle?
- No need.
- She's a rare beauty, sire.
- Yes.
She is.
So is the mare.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, and the strength to make it endure.
As you all know, I am soon to be married.
- And about time.
Too.
- Hear!
We have had our share of war.
Now, I look forward to quieter days.
But first, admit our guest.
- Malagant...
- Malagant is here at my invitation.
May I congratulate the King on his forthcoming marriage.
I see my place hasn't been taken yet.
- I was first among your knights.
- You left of your own free will.
We each of us must follow our own road.
Where does your road take you?
To Leonesse?
Leonesse is my neighbour.
I offered the lady a treaty of friendship.
- Is burning villages friendship?
- Yes, My Lady...
Your land is becoming lawless.
Were you not just attacked?
- You know who attacked me.
- I made it my business to know.
- Justice has been done.
- You know no law above yourself!
"Armed forces to be given access to all Leonesse."
"Troops to assist in the enforcement of law... in all Leonesse."
- Do you want to sign this?
- I'll never sign it.
She's very brave...
now she's to be married.
- Will Camelot protect Leonesse?
- Is Leonesse in need of protection?
Come.
Arthur.
I'm here to settle this business.
Leonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let's say half each.
The lesser gives way to the greater.
What nation is greater than Camelot?
The land of justice.
Come... your hand on it.
We'II all live together as friends.
You offer me what isn't yours to give.
You all know me.
You know I'm a man of my word.
Don't make an enemy of me.
- I mean no harm to Camelot.
- You know the law we live by.
Where is it written.
Beyond Camelot live lesser people?
People too weak to protect themselves, let them die?
Other people live by other laws.
Or does your law rule the world?
There are laws that enslave men.
And laws that set them free.
Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God. or we're just a robber tribe.
Your words are talking you out of peace and into war.
There's a peace you only find after war.
If that battle must come.
I will fight it!
- And I!
- And I!
The great Arthur...
and his great dream.
No dream lasts forever.
- What is the status of the army?
- Four battalions.
Two in reserve.
- I'll double the watch.
- I don't think Malagant wants war.
Arm the reserves.
He wants war.
- He wants Leonesse as a buffer.
- He wants Camelot.
- How soon could he attack?
- His army is five days' march away.
So much for my quieter days.
Who approaches there?
I come with a message for Lady Guinevere!
Enter.
- My Lady, it's Jacob.
- Where?
- Coming to the north gate.
- Leonesse...
Jacob...
- Mind the step.
- Jacob.
What is it?
They've taken Lady Guinevere!
Taken?
Taken where?
A boat, sire.
From the north gate into the forest.
I have scouts and dogs out already.
Give me a battalion of guards.
- Give me the men.
- No, that's exactly what he wants.
- Take one brigade, now!
- Sire.
He'll not harm her.
Sire.
She's too valuable.
- He'll try to trade her first.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
I'd give my life for her.
But what if he asks for more?
Welcome to my palace...
My Lady.
I think we can release the lady from her bonds.
If she so wishes.
What's this?
Your dress is torn.
Ralph...
I gave orders that the lady was not to be harmed.
Your dress is quite spoiled.
You almost a queen.
Ralph.
Did you do this?
- Yes, My Prince.
- You see?
This is what Arthur doesn't understand.
Men don't want brotherhood.
They want leadership.
Shall we?
This was once the greatest castle ever built.
Now grass grows in the halls where kings once feasted, and peasants cart away the walls to make shelters for their pigs.
- Such is glory.
- What do you mean to do with me?
Keep you till Arthur becomes reasonable.
He won't trade Leonesse for my life.
I'd rather die.
Arthur knows that.
Self-sacrifice is very easy.
But sacrificing someone you love puts your convictions to the test.
I'm sure Arthur will come round to the merits of compromise.
This is called an oubliette.
That's French for a place of forgetting.
Your quarters, My Lady.
No gates, no bars, no locks.
Just walls of air.
You can come out!
I'm unarmed and alone!
- Who are you?
- A messenger from the King.
- He came alone?
- Yes, My Prince.
- What is your message?
- Is Lady Guinevere unharmed?
She's unharmed.
I give you my word.
- I need to see it with my own eyes.
- My word isn't good enough?
I'm a common man.
I don't have much use for words.
He does have a message.
Take him to the pit, then bring him back.
- You've seen her.
Let's go.
- No.
- I still have a message to deliver.
- All right.
We'll drag you back.
Jump on!
Jump!
Come on!
Jump!
If the water can get out, so can we.
Come on.
No!
Hold on!
Shoot!
Why have we stopped?
- I'm tired.
- Never.
You battle in your dreams.
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.
Now.
Drink.
Again.
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I lived most of my life outdoors.
Don't you have a home?
No.
I don't have a home.
Not for a long time.
- That must be hard.
- Why must it be?
I'm my own master.
I go where I please.
Why build a house for the warlords to burn?
Is that how it happened?
God save you from such a day.
How old were you?
Mother!
Father!
It was long ago.
- God save us all from such a day.
- He didn't save me.
- Ah.
But he did.
- For what?
It's made you who you are.
A man who fears nothing and no one.
You can use that gift.
If not, you might as well have died.
You don't know how many times I've wished for that.
But you didn't die.
You lived.
- Tell me what to do.
- Your life is your own.
I give it to you.
You forget I'm to be married.
If you could freely do as you pleased, would you marry Arthur?
- I am free.
As free as you are.
- Prove it.
- How?
- Forget who you are.
Let all the world go away...
and all the people in it, but us.
Do what you want to do.
Here.
Now.
There she is!
Thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You can go.
You must have better things to do.
You have given me back my life.
I can at least give you your shirt.
- Tell me what you want.
It's yours.
- I did what any man would do.
You risked your life for another.
There is no greater love.
You have deceived me.
But now...
I know the truth.
You care nothing for yourself.
No wealth, no home, no goal, just the passionate spirit that drives you on.
God uses people like you.
Because your heart is open, you give all of yourself.
If you knew me better, you wouldn't say such things.
I take the good with the bad.
I can't love people in slices.
Now, no more protests.
Let me thank you in my own way.
They are welcoming you back.
We owe Lady Guinevere's life to one man.
Lancelot.
I believe he comes to Camelot for a purpose, even though he doesn't know it himself.
What I'm about to offer this man is already his.
One seat stands empty.
- You'd make him a knight, sire?
- I offer no life of privilege.
It's a life of service.
If you want it, it's yours.
- We don't know anything about him.
- Perhaps we should discuss...
Enough!
What do you say?
Will you join us?
My Lord, if I may speak?
I owe this man more than anyone here.
He deserves any honour you can give him.
But he doesn't belong in Camelot.
He's a man who goes his way alone.
In that freedom and solitude is his strength.
If you wish to honour him, as I do, with all my heart, let's honour him as he is.
Let him go, alone and free...
and with our love.
Well...
Lancelot?
Lady Guinevere understands me well.
But here, among you, -
- I have found something that I want more than freedom.
It would break my heart to leave you.
Bravo!
Then you'll join us?
- Yes.
- Welcome.
This is only the beginning.
Go pass this night in prayer, for tomorrow you'll be born again, into a new life.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Please leave Camelot.
- I want to be where you are.
You must not say such things to me.
Say nothing.
I will leave Camelot now.
If you come with me.
- No.
- Then tell me you don't love me.
I don't love you.
Arise.
Sir Lancelot.
Brother to brother.
Yours in life and death.
Brother to brother.
Yours in life and death.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere.
My true and rightful queen.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere.
And to protect her honour as my own.
Jacob...
Forgive me, milady.
Black Malagant has taken Leonesse.
Leonesse...
The gates are open.
- Make camp for the night.
- Where.
Sire?
There.
It's too exposed.
Sire.
We could never possibly defend it.
Sire.
They're not here.
There's no one here!
Draw!
Loose!
Charge!
Attack!
- Archers in position, sire.
- Hold position.
- Their left wing is falling back.
- Second battalion to the left!
Is our centre holding?
Charge!
- They're breaking, sire.
- Do not give chase.
- First battalion regrouped, sire.
- Sound the advance.
- They're running.
Do we follow?
- No.
Let them go.
On to Leonesse!
Well done.
Your sword...
Sir Lancelot.
No!
No!
- Come out.
- They're alive.
You're safe.
Don't be afraid.
We're glad you're safe.
There's a step.
Be careful.
God bless you, sir.
I'm so old now...
Can I go home now?
Can I go home now?
Yes.
Yes, you can go home now.
Bless you, milady.
Elise...
I've come to say goodbye, and wish you well.
It's been a long night.
You've not slept.
- Where will you go?
- Wherever the road leads.
When shall we see you again?
I don't think I'll be coming back.
Never?
Never.
I know what I must do now.
I never believed in anything before.
But I do believe in Camelot.
And I will serve it best by leaving.
Tell the King, I'll always remember that he saw the best in me.
And what shall I tell myself?
There was once a man who loved you too much to change you.
I'll not forget him.
I sheltered under a tree with him once... in the rain.
Lancelot...
- My Queen.
- I owe you a kiss.
I'm asking you.
Why?
Why?
The King asks for you, milady.
I ask you not to lie to me, even if you think you'll hurt me.
- Have you given yourself to him?
- No, My Lord.
Do you love him?
Yes.
- How did I fail you?
- You've never failed me, My Lord.
I saw your face as you kissed him.
Love has many faces.
I look on you differently, but not with less love.
When a woman loves two men.
She must choose between them.
- I choose you.
- Your will chooses me.
- Your heart chooses him.
- My will is stronger than my heart.
Do you think I put so high a price on my feelings?
They'll pass.
My will holds me to my course through life.
As mine does me, and yet, all I have to do is look at you and everything I ever believed in fades to nothing.
- All I want is your love.
- You have it.
Do I?
Then look on me as you looked on him.
I gave one moment to Lancelot.
Yes, you're innocent.
But you love him!
Any more of this innocence and I'll go mad.
- I'll do whatever you tell me to.
- I don't know what to think.
I no longer see my way ahead.
Only fools dream of the one thing they can't have.
Forgive me.
What's to forgive?
I dreamed the dream of you.
It was a sweet dream while it lasted.
- Unlock the door.
- Sire.
- My Lord?
- I'll ask the questions.
Did you come to Camelot to betray me?
- No, My Lord.
- You desired her.
You pursued her.
- The Queen is innocent.
- Innocent?
I saw her in your arms.
I trusted you, and you betrayed me.
- I never meant to hurt you.
- You leave me nothing!
Nothing!
You will be charged with treason.
Defend yourself in court.
The law will judge you!
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, and the strength to make it endure.
Amen.
I was mistaken in Lancelot.
As a man, I may forgive...
As a king, I must see justice done.
There will be a trial tomorrow.
In the great square.
- In the great square?
- Let's settle the matter privately.
You think the honour of Camelot is a private matter?
Am I to hide in dark corners as if I'm ashamed?
Open the gates.
I want everyone there.
Let every citizen see that the law rules in Camelot.
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, Queen of Camelot. -
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, Queen of Camelot. and Lancelot.
Knight of the High Council, are charged in their own persons, and in collusion. with dishonour to the realm.
And violation of the King's rights.
These crimes constitute an act of treason against Camelot, and the penalty under law is death.
- Sir Lancelot may speak.
- My words are for the King alone.
My Lord.
The Queen is innocent.
But if my life, or my death, serves Camelot.
Take it.
Do what you like with me.
Brother to brother.
Yours in life and death.
Is it the King's wish that the Queen be questioned?
May God forgive me.
Is it the King's wish that the Queen be questioned?
- Who goes there?
- Who goes there?
Guards!
Close the gates!
Nobody move or Arthur dies!
My men control the city gates.
On every roof, I have men with burning torches!
I have only to lift my arm, and your golden city burns to ashes.
I am the law now!
You obeyed Arthur.
Now, obey me.
My people are unarmed, Malagant.
If it's me you want, here I am.
Look at him!
Look at the great King Arthur of Camelot.
He's a man waking up from a dream.
The strong rule the weak!
That's how your God made the world.
He makes us strong only for a while, so we can help each other.
My God makes me strong so I can live my life!
Arthur says, "Serve one another." When will you live your own lives?
This is the freedom I bring you!
Freedom from his tyrannical dream!
Freedom from his tyrannical law!
Freedom from his tyrannical God!
I want your people to see you kneel before me here.
Kneel before me.
Or die.
Too proud, Arthur?
Do you think you serve your people better dead?
I have no pride left in me.
What I do now.
I do for my people, and for Camelot.
And may they forgive me.
This is my last act as your king.
Do not be afraid.
All things change.
I am Arthur of Camelot.
I command you now, all to fight!
Fight!
Like you've never fought before!
No!
- Camelot lives!
- Burn everything!
No!
Be careful!
Come on!
Sword!
Camelot will never fall to the tyranny of Malagant!
- Is there no more we can do?
- I'm sorry.
- Lancelot...
- Yes, My Lord?
- Where's my sword?
- Here.
My truest... my First Knight.
Camelot is your home now.
You are the future...
The future of Camelot.
You take care of her for me.
Take care of her.
I feel it now, my love.
The sunlight.
It's in your eyes.
English subtitles
- IFT
Good.
Do you want to know how to win?
Be the only one with a sword.
Easy.
Give him a hand!
He fought well!
Well done, John.
Winner takes all, my friends!
One more challenger and I'll leave.
Once in a lifetime, you meet a man so fearless, no man can touch him.
While you're waiting for him, you can practice on me.
As sure as the sun will rise, there's a man who's better than me.
He could be here.
It could be today.
Yeah!
It could be you.
- He looks strong.
Is he good?
- Try him and see!
Go on, Mark.
But don't hurt him.
So, you're Mark, are you?
I'm Lancelot.
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.
You don't have to kill me to win.
- Got tight hold of your sword?
- Don't you worry about that!
Can I give you some advice?
Don't drop your sword.
Is this your sword?
Give him a hand!
- Well done, Mark!
- How did you do that?
- Was that a trick?
- No.
That's the way I fight.
Could I do it?
Tell me.
I can learn.
Study your opponent, so you know what he'll do before he does it.
- I can do that.
- And wait for the critical moment.
- I can do that.
- You can't care about your life.
Come on!
Quickly!
Shut the doors!
Where's Daddy?
Burn it down.
We'll be burnt alive!
We need water!
Get water!
- No!
Wait till they've gone!
- We'll be dead by then!
Malagant.
Last night, men from this village killed three of my people.
In reprisal, I have destroyed your village.
The borderlands have been lawless long enough.
Know now, that I am the law!
Come on!
There she is.
Mind the dog!
- Come here, milady.
- Wait.
- Milady...
- I won't be much longer.
There's been another attack.
Another border village burnt.
Anne, take my place.
- Is it Malagant again?
- Yes.
A small group got away.
- Are they being looked after?
- They want to see you first.
No, no, please.
You poor people, after such a terrible journey.
We didn't know where else to turn, milady.
They say we're outlaws.
They say we crossed the border.
I know.
It's all lies.
He means to frighten us into submission.
- Don't give in to him.
We'll fight.
- I'm not the yielding kind.
Jacob.
Take these good people in and give them food and drink.
When you've rested, we shall pray for your village and for Leonesse.
- God keep you safe, milady.
- And you.
Now, go.
- It's the third village he's burnt.
- Does he want to destroy us all?
- He wants us to sign his treaty.
- He thinks we won't challenge him.
If he doesn't get what he asks, he has the power to take it.
Oswald...
You say nothing.
- You know what I think, child.
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Prince Malagant must be answered.
- He will be.
I shall decide today.
Now leave me.
Oswald, stay.
- I had hoped to have more time.
- Don't you know your own heart?
I know what I want.
I want to marry.
I want to live and die in Leonesse.
But I can't have everything I want, can I?
Forgive me, but an offer of marriage from Arthur of Camelot...
Yes, I know.
You're right, of course.
No more words.
Let it be done.
- You accept the offer?
- I shall marry Arthur of Camelot.
I was so proud to hold you in my arms at your birth.
I shall be prouder still to see you wed.
Poor Arthur.
The only dowry I bring him is a land in danger.
- But I shall love him, Oswald.
- You should, child.
I could never marry a man without love.
Arthur wears his power so lightly.
He has such gentleness in his eyes.
I've never known anyone like him.
How could I love anyone more?
Halt!
It could be an ambush.
Look to the trees!
Protect the carriage!
Don't break the line.
Wait!
Wait!
Now!
Follow!
Follow!
It's all right.
They're going.
Wait!
Watch your flank!
We've got to jump!
Come on, Elise!
Roll when you hit the ground!
Petronella, come on!
You have to!
Hurry!
Save yourself!
It's me they'll follow!
She must have gone to ground.
She can't be far.
There!
Don't move.
- Who are you?
- Who cares?
Kill him!
- What is it?
- There were three.
Don't even breathe.
You... drop the sword.
- Can I have her when you're done?
- You were after the woman?
Of course.
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?
- I don't know about that.
- You don't want her?
Her soft skin, sweet lips...
young, firm body.
- I have my orders.
- Who's to know?
- I should take her back.
- I'll hold her for you.
- It won't take long.
- I don't want any trouble.
This one's no trouble.
Look at her.
She wants it.
- What's she doing?
- See for yourself.
Turn her around.
Look into her eyes.
See what she's got for you.
Hello, pretty.
Now... what have you got for me?
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Why did you risk your life for me?
They could have killed you.
I'm not that easy to kill.
Do you know who I am?
Guinevere.
I'm the Lady of Leonesse.
Well?
Doesn't it please you to know you saved the life of a lady?
- I'd be happy to save a dairy maid.
- She couldn't reward you.
If she were as pretty as you, she could.
- What did I do?
- You insulted me.
Now I've insulted you.
How dare you treat me like this?
I take it you know no better.
You have done me a good service and I shall forget the matter.
- Which way?
- I've never been here before.
- How do you know where the road is?
- I'm guessing.
See the scavenger birds?
They're looking for small animals crushed by the passing wagons.
- About this reward...
- My man will pay you.
- I don't want money.
- I'm on my way to be married.
Then you're not married yet.
You're free.
- I've given my word.
- I don't want your word.
- I want you.
- I'm not to be had for the wanting.
Why not?
If you want me.
- You may impress servant girls...
- I can tell when a woman wants me.
- I can see it in her eyes.
- Not in my eyes.
- You're afraid, aren't you?
- I have nothing to hide.
Then look at me.
If there is any honour in you, promise me never to do that again.
I don't know about honour.
But I promise you...
I won't kiss you again until you ask me to.
And that I never will.
- When do you get married?
- On Midsummer's Day.
Before Midsummer's Day dawns, you'll ask me to kiss you again.
- You insult me, then abandon me?
- That's the road ahead.
And that, I presume, is your brave escort.
- My child...
Thank the Lord.
- Are my ladies safe?
- Were you followed, milady?
- No.
No, there's no one there.
Your new country awaits you.
- If anything should happen...
- I'll send word.
Never fear.
Send Jacob.
I want to know at once, good news or bad.
Promise me.
I promise you.
I promise you.
Lady Guinevere of Leonesse.
Welcome to Camelot.
God be praised, you're safe.
Nothing shall ever harm you again.
My Lord honours me with his kindness.
Your coming brings me a happiness I had not dared hope for.
My Lord must not think too highly of me, lest he'll be disappointed.
Then I'll take you as I find you, if you'll do as much for me.
Leonesse awaits news of your safety.
John will send any message you want.
My Lord grants my wishes before I speak them.
Tell my people I'm come safe into my new country.
Tell them you saw my eyes filled with tears ofjoy.
Already a queen.
- Agravaine, what happened?
- Ambush, sire.
- Malagant?
- It has to be.
- Was Lady Guinevere in danger?
- We were all in danger, sire.
There were two separate forces.
- Lady Guinevere was in danger.
- You weren't prepared for them?
So many fell in the first strike.
How could we guess they had a second force?
Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses, so long as he wins.
- I'll not fail you again, sire.
- We both know no one is perfect.
- But I need to know everything.
- Sire.
Come.
I first climbed this hill as a boy and saw what was to become my city.
I named it Camelot.
- It's so beautiful it frightens me.
- Why do you say that?
I was brought up to set no faith in finery.
"Beauty doesn't last", my father said.
I remember the way he looked at you.
I remember him saying,
"Do all fathers think their daughters are so beautiful?"
He never said that to me.
Camelot.
Good girl...
Thank you!
You saved me from a long ride.
God knows when she'd have stopped.
- She's a fine animal.
- Fit for a queen.
- I'm Peter.
King's stableman.
- Lancelot.
Which king?
The King.
Arthur of Camelot.
This beauty is a gift for his bride.
People swore he would never marry, but I knew better.
He was just waiting for the right one.
Like we all do.
There'll be some feasting today!
Come on!
The party's started!
Beat the gauntlet and meet the King!
Who's got the heart of a lion?
Be the first to get through the gauntlet, and you'll be up there drinking, as if he's your brother!
Get up here!
Get padded up and beat the gauntlet!
What about you boys out there?
Give your support to this brave, young man!
Beat the gauntlet and meet our lovely queen!
Will you give the victor a kiss, milady?
How's that?
Beat the gauntlet and win a kiss from Lady Guinevere, soon to be our lovely queen!
Who will it be?
Not like that, idiot!
Come and get padded up first!
Get down!
You're mad!
You'll kill yourself!
Go on!
Yes!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
- Extraordinary.
What's your name?
- Lancelot.
Lancelot.
We won't forget that name.
Your prize...
- Ask me.
- No.
Ask me.
Never.
I dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
I only have one heart to lose.
Come.
Well done.
- Have you run the gauntlet before?
- No, never.
- How did you do it?
- You have to see the danger coming.
Others have found it very hard.
You're the first one to do it.
Perhaps fear made them go back instead of forward.
- And you felt no fear?
- No.
I have nothing to lose.
No home... family?
Do you have a profession?
- I live by my sword.
- You fight for pay.
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
I knew I could do it, so I did it.
Well, Lancelot...
you're an unusual man.
I've never seen such a display of courage, skill, nerve, grace and... stupidity.
Come.
Here, every life is precious, even the lives of strangers.
If you must die, die serving something greater than yourself.
Better still, live... and serve.
- The Round Table.
- Yes.
The High Council meets here.
No head, no foot.
Everyone equal... even the King.
"ln serving each other, we become free".
That is the very heart of Camelot.
Not these stones, timbers, towers, palaces.
Burn them all...
and Camelot lives on.
Because it lives in us.
It's a belief we hold in our hearts.
Well, no matter.
- Stay in Camelot.
I invite you.
- I'll be on the road again soon.
- What road?
- Wherever chance takes me.
Do you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?
- Yes.
- In that hallway are two doors.
- How will you choose between them?
- It won't matter.
It's all chance.
I hope chance leads you to the left.
It's the only way out.
Lancelot!
Just a thought...
A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing.
And if you love nothing, what joy is there in your life?
I may be wrong.
Peter!
Show us how she goes.
- She's yours.
- She's beautiful.
Peter thinks she's not suitable for a lady.
- I would have chosen her myself.
- I know.
- How do you know?
- Remember when you joined our hunt?
- You were fearless.
- My father's word was "reckless".
He was always sparing with praise.
Come.
- We could almost be alone here.
- Do you have secrets to tell me?
No.
No secrets.
Just a question to ask.
Do you want to marry me?
You don't have to marry me because your father wanted it.
Camelot will protect Leonesse, whether you marry me or not.
Thank you.
You don't know what it means to me to hear you say that.
Do you want to be released from the engagement?
No.
I want to marry you.
Not your crown or your army or your golden city.
Just you.
- Just me?
- Yes.
If you love me.
- Do you remember this?
- You hurt it in the hunt.
- I didn't think you'd get a scar.
- Just a scratch.
You wiped the blood away with a sleeve of your dress.
The sleeve still carries the stain.
I never thought until then how sweet it must be to be loved by one woman.
And for the first time in my life, I wanted...
- What?
- What wise men say doesn't last.
What cannot be promised, or made to linger any more than sunlight.
But I don't want to die, without having felt its warmth on my face.
Marry the King, Guinevere, but love the man.
I only know one way to love.
And that is body... and heart...
and soul.
I kiss the hurt that brought me your love.
Try her.
- Shall I fetch a lady's saddle?
- No need.
- She's a rare beauty, sire.
- Yes, she is.
So is the mare.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, and the strength to make it endure.
As you all know, I am soon to be married.
- And about time, too.
- Hear!
We have had our share of war.
Now, I look forward to quieter days.
But first, admit our guest.
- Malagant...
- Malagant is here at my invitation.
May I congratulate the King on his forthcoming marriage.
I see my place hasn't been taken yet.
- I was first among your knights.
- You left of your own free will.
We each of us must follow our own road.
Where does your road take you?
To Leonesse?
Leonesse is my neighbour.
I offered the lady a treaty of friendship.
- Is burning villages friendship?
- Yes, My Lady...
Your land is becoming lawless.
Were you not just attacked?
- You know who attacked me.
- I made it my business to know.
- Justice has been done.
- You know no law above yourself!
"Armed forces to be given access to all Leonesse".
"Troops to assist in the enforcement of law... in all Leonesse".
- Do you want to sign this?
- I'll never sign it.
She's very brave...
now she's to be married.
- Will Camelot protect Leonesse?
- Is Leonesse in need of protection?
Come, Arthur.
I'm here to settle this business.
Leonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let's say half each.
The lesser gives way to the greater.
What nation is greater than Camelot?
The land ofjustice.
Come... your hand on it.
We'll all live together as friends.
You offer me what isn't yours to give.
You all know me.
You know I'm a man of my word.
Don't make an enemy of me.
- I mean no harm to Camelot.
- You know the law we live by.
Where is it written, beyond Camelot live lesser people?
People too weak to protect themselves, let them die?
Other people live by other laws.
Or does your law rule the world?
There are laws that enslave men, and laws that set them free.
Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God, or we're just a robber tribe.
Your words are talking you out of peace and into war.
There's a peace you only find after war.
If that battle must come, I will fight it!
- And I!
- And I!
The great Arthur...
and his great dream.
No dream lasts forever.
- What is the status of the army?
- Four battalions, two in reserve.
- I'll double the watch.
- I don't think Malagant wants war.
Arm the reserves.
He wants war.
- He wants Leonesse as a buffer.
- He wants Camelot.
- How soon could he attack?
- His army is five days' march away.
So much for my quieter days.
Who approaches there?
I come with a message for Lady Guinevere!
Enter.
- My Lady, it's Jacob.
- Where?
- Coming to the north gate.
- Leonesse...
Jacob...
- Mind the step.
- Jacob, what is it?
They've taken Lady Guinevere!
Be the only one with a sword.
Easy.
Give him a hand!
He fought well!
Well done, John.
Winner takes all, my friends!
One more challenger and I'll leave.
Once in a lifetime, you meet a man so fearless, no man can touch him.
While you're waiting for him, you can practice on me.
As sure as the sun will rise, there's a man who's better than me.
He could be here.
It could be today.
Yeah!
It could be you.
- He looks strong.
Is he good?
- Try him and see!
Go on, Mark.
But don't hurt him.
So, you're Mark, are you?
I'm Lancelot.
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.
You don't have to kill me to win.
- Got tight hold of your sword?
- Don't you worry about that!
Can I give you some advice?
Don't drop your sword.
Is this your sword?
Give him a hand!
- Well done, Mark!
- How did you do that?
- Was that a trick?
- No.
That's the way I fight.
Could I do it?
Tell me.
I can learn.
Study your opponent, so you know what he'll do before he does it.
- I can do that.
- And wait for the critical moment.
- I can do that.
- You can't care about your life.
Come on!
Quickly!
Shut the doors!
Where's Daddy?
Burn it down.
We'll be burnt alive!
We need water!
Get water!
- No!
Wait till they've gone!
- We'll be dead by then!
Malagant.
Last night, men from this village killed three of my people.
In reprisal, I have destroyed your village.
The borderlands have been lawless long enough.
Know now, that I am the law!
Come on!
There she is.
Mind the dog!
- Come here, milady.
- Wait.
- Milady...
- I won't be much longer.
There's been another attack.
Another border village burnt.
Anne, take my place.
- Is it Malagant again?
- Yes.
A small group got away.
- Are they being looked after?
- They want to see you first.
No, no, please.
You poor people, after such a terrible journey.
We didn't know where else to turn, milady.
They say we're outlaws.
They say we crossed the border.
I know.
It's all lies.
He means to frighten us into submission.
- Don't give in to him.
We'll fight.
- I'm not the yielding kind.
Jacob.
Take these good people in and give them food and drink.
When you've rested, we shall pray for your village and for Leonesse.
- God keep you safe, milady.
- And you.
Now, go.
- It's the third village he's burnt.
- Does he want to destroy us all?
- He wants us to sign his treaty.
- He thinks we won't challenge him.
If he doesn't get what he asks, he has the power to take it.
Oswald...
You say nothing.
- You know what I think, child.
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Prince Malagant must be answered.
- He will be.
I shall decide today.
Now leave me.
Oswald, stay.
- I had hoped to have more time.
- Don't you know your own heart?
I know what I want.
I want to marry.
I want to live and die in Leonesse.
But I can't have everything I want, can I?
Forgive me, but an offer of marriage from Arthur of Camelot...
Yes, I know.
You're right, of course.
No more words.
Let it be done.
- You accept the offer?
- I shall marry Arthur of Camelot.
I was so proud to hold you in my arms at your birth.
I shall be prouder still to see you wed.
Poor Arthur.
The only dowry I bring him is a land in danger.
- But I shall love him, Oswald.
- You should, child.
I could never marry a man without love.
Arthur wears his power so lightly.
He has such gentleness in his eyes.
I've never known anyone like him.
How could I love anyone more?
Halt!
It could be an ambush.
Look to the trees!
Protect the carriage!
Don't break the line.
Wait!
Wait!
Now!
Follow!
Follow!
It's all right.
They're going.
Wait!
Watch your flank!
We've got to jump!
Come on, Elise!
Roll when you hit the ground!
Petronella, come on!
You have to!
Hurry!
Save yourself!
It's me they'll follow!
She must have gone to ground.
She can't be far.
There!
Don't move.
- Who are you?
- Who cares?
Kill him!
- What is it?
- There were three.
Don't even breathe.
You... drop the sword.
- Can I have her when you're done?
- You were after the woman?
Of course.
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?
- I don't know about that.
- You don't want her?
Her soft skin, sweet lips...
young, firm body.
- I have my orders.
- Who's to know?
- I should take her back.
- I'll hold her for you.
- It won't take long.
- I don't want any trouble.
This one's no trouble.
Look at her.
She wants it.
- What's she doing?
- See for yourself.
Turn her around.
Look into her eyes.
See what she's got for you.
Hello, pretty.
Now... what have you got for me?
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Why did you risk your life for me?
They could have killed you.
I'm not that easy to kill.
Do you know who I am?
Guinevere.
I'm the Lady of Leonesse.
Well?
Doesn't it please you to know you saved the life of a lady?
- I'd be happy to save a dairy maid.
- She couldn't reward you.
If she were as pretty as you, she could.
- What did I do?
- You insulted me.
Now I've insulted you.
How dare you treat me like this?
I take it you know no better.
You have done me a good service and I shall forget the matter.
- Which way?
- I've never been here before.
- How do you know where the road is?
- I'm guessing.
See the scavenger birds?
They're looking for small animals crushed by the passing wagons.
- About this reward...
- My man will pay you.
- I don't want money.
- I'm on my way to be married.
Then you're not married yet.
You're free.
- I've given my word.
- I don't want your word.
- I want you.
- I'm not to be had for the wanting.
Why not?
If you want me.
- You may impress servant girls...
- I can tell when a woman wants me.
- I can see it in her eyes.
- Not in my eyes.
- You're afraid, aren't you?
- I have nothing to hide.
Then look at me.
If there is any honour in you, promise me never to do that again.
I don't know about honour.
But I promise you...
I won't kiss you again until you ask me to.
And that I never will.
- When do you get married?
- On Midsummer's Day.
Before Midsummer's Day dawns, you'll ask me to kiss you again.
- You insult me, then abandon me?
- That's the road ahead.
And that, I presume, is your brave escort.
- My child...
Thank the Lord.
- Are my ladies safe?
- Were you followed, milady?
- No.
No, there's no one there.
Your new country awaits you.
- If anything should happen...
- I'll send word.
Never fear.
Send Jacob.
I want to know at once, good news or bad.
Promise me.
I promise you.
I promise you.
Lady Guinevere of Leonesse.
Welcome to Camelot.
God be praised, you're safe.
Nothing shall ever harm you again.
My Lord honours me with his kindness.
Your coming brings me a happiness I had not dared hope for.
My Lord must not think too highly of me, lest he'll be disappointed.
Then I'll take you as I find you, if you'll do as much for me.
Leonesse awaits news of your safety.
John will send any message you want.
My Lord grants my wishes before I speak them.
Tell my people I'm come safe into my new country.
Tell them you saw my eyes filled with tears ofjoy.
Already a queen.
- Agravaine, what happened?
- Ambush, sire.
- Malagant?
- It has to be.
- Was Lady Guinevere in danger?
- We were all in danger, sire.
There were two separate forces.
- Lady Guinevere was in danger.
- You weren't prepared for them?
So many fell in the first strike.
How could we guess they had a second force?
Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses, so long as he wins.
- I'll not fail you again, sire.
- We both know no one is perfect.
- But I need to know everything.
- Sire.
Come.
I first climbed this hill as a boy and saw what was to become my city.
I named it Camelot.
- It's so beautiful it frightens me.
- Why do you say that?
I was brought up to set no faith in finery.
"Beauty doesn't last", my father said.
I remember the way he looked at you.
I remember him saying,
"Do all fathers think their daughters are so beautiful?"
He never said that to me.
Camelot.
Good girl...
Thank you!
You saved me from a long ride.
God knows when she'd have stopped.
- She's a fine animal.
- Fit for a queen.
- I'm Peter.
King's stableman.
- Lancelot.
Which king?
The King.
Arthur of Camelot.
This beauty is a gift for his bride.
People swore he would never marry, but I knew better.
He was just waiting for the right one.
Like we all do.
There'll be some feasting today!
Come on!
The party's started!
Beat the gauntlet and meet the King!
Who's got the heart of a lion?
Be the first to get through the gauntlet, and you'll be up there drinking, as if he's your brother!
Get up here!
Get padded up and beat the gauntlet!
What about you boys out there?
Give your support to this brave, young man!
Beat the gauntlet and meet our lovely queen!
Will you give the victor a kiss, milady?
How's that?
Beat the gauntlet and win a kiss from Lady Guinevere, soon to be our lovely queen!
Who will it be?
Not like that, idiot!
Come and get padded up first!
Get down!
You're mad!
You'll kill yourself!
Go on!
Yes!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
- Extraordinary.
What's your name?
- Lancelot.
Lancelot.
We won't forget that name.
Your prize...
- Ask me.
- No.
Ask me.
Never.
I dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
I only have one heart to lose.
Come.
Well done.
- Have you run the gauntlet before?
- No, never.
- How did you do it?
- You have to see the danger coming.
Others have found it very hard.
You're the first one to do it.
Perhaps fear made them go back instead of forward.
- And you felt no fear?
- No.
I have nothing to lose.
No home... family?
Do you have a profession?
- I live by my sword.
- You fight for pay.
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
I knew I could do it, so I did it.
Well, Lancelot...
you're an unusual man.
I've never seen such a display of courage, skill, nerve, grace and... stupidity.
Come.
Here, every life is precious, even the lives of strangers.
If you must die, die serving something greater than yourself.
Better still, live... and serve.
- The Round Table.
- Yes.
The High Council meets here.
No head, no foot.
Everyone equal... even the King.
"ln serving each other, we become free".
That is the very heart of Camelot.
Not these stones, timbers, towers, palaces.
Burn them all...
and Camelot lives on.
Because it lives in us.
It's a belief we hold in our hearts.
Well, no matter.
- Stay in Camelot.
I invite you.
- I'll be on the road again soon.
- What road?
- Wherever chance takes me.
Do you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?
- Yes.
- In that hallway are two doors.
- How will you choose between them?
- It won't matter.
It's all chance.
I hope chance leads you to the left.
It's the only way out.
Lancelot!
Just a thought...
A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing.
And if you love nothing, what joy is there in your life?
I may be wrong.
Peter!
Show us how she goes.
- She's yours.
- She's beautiful.
Peter thinks she's not suitable for a lady.
- I would have chosen her myself.
- I know.
- How do you know?
- Remember when you joined our hunt?
- You were fearless.
- My father's word was "reckless".
He was always sparing with praise.
Come.
- We could almost be alone here.
- Do you have secrets to tell me?
No.
No secrets.
Just a question to ask.
Do you want to marry me?
You don't have to marry me because your father wanted it.
Camelot will protect Leonesse, whether you marry me or not.
Thank you.
You don't know what it means to me to hear you say that.
Do you want to be released from the engagement?
No.
I want to marry you.
Not your crown or your army or your golden city.
Just you.
- Just me?
- Yes.
If you love me.
- Do you remember this?
- You hurt it in the hunt.
- I didn't think you'd get a scar.
- Just a scratch.
You wiped the blood away with a sleeve of your dress.
The sleeve still carries the stain.
I never thought until then how sweet it must be to be loved by one woman.
And for the first time in my life, I wanted...
- What?
- What wise men say doesn't last.
What cannot be promised, or made to linger any more than sunlight.
But I don't want to die, without having felt its warmth on my face.
Marry the King, Guinevere, but love the man.
I only know one way to love.
And that is body... and heart...
and soul.
I kiss the hurt that brought me your love.
Try her.
- Shall I fetch a lady's saddle?
- No need.
- She's a rare beauty, sire.
- Yes, she is.
So is the mare.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, and the strength to make it endure.
As you all know, I am soon to be married.
- And about time, too.
- Hear!
We have had our share of war.
Now, I look forward to quieter days.
But first, admit our guest.
- Malagant...
- Malagant is here at my invitation.
May I congratulate the King on his forthcoming marriage.
I see my place hasn't been taken yet.
- I was first among your knights.
- You left of your own free will.
We each of us must follow our own road.
Where does your road take you?
To Leonesse?
Leonesse is my neighbour.
I offered the lady a treaty of friendship.
- Is burning villages friendship?
- Yes, My Lady...
Your land is becoming lawless.
Were you not just attacked?
- You know who attacked me.
- I made it my business to know.
- Justice has been done.
- You know no law above yourself!
"Armed forces to be given access to all Leonesse".
"Troops to assist in the enforcement of law... in all Leonesse".
- Do you want to sign this?
- I'll never sign it.
She's very brave...
now she's to be married.
- Will Camelot protect Leonesse?
- Is Leonesse in need of protection?
Come, Arthur.
I'm here to settle this business.
Leonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let's say half each.
The lesser gives way to the greater.
What nation is greater than Camelot?
The land ofjustice.
Come... your hand on it.
We'll all live together as friends.
You offer me what isn't yours to give.
You all know me.
You know I'm a man of my word.
Don't make an enemy of me.
- I mean no harm to Camelot.
- You know the law we live by.
Where is it written, beyond Camelot live lesser people?
People too weak to protect themselves, let them die?
Other people live by other laws.
Or does your law rule the world?
There are laws that enslave men, and laws that set them free.
Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God, or we're just a robber tribe.
Your words are talking you out of peace and into war.
There's a peace you only find after war.
If that battle must come, I will fight it!
- And I!
- And I!
The great Arthur...
and his great dream.
No dream lasts forever.
- What is the status of the army?
- Four battalions, two in reserve.
- I'll double the watch.
- I don't think Malagant wants war.
Arm the reserves.
He wants war.
- He wants Leonesse as a buffer.
- He wants Camelot.
- How soon could he attack?
- His army is five days' march away.
So much for my quieter days.
Who approaches there?
I come with a message for Lady Guinevere!
Enter.
- My Lady, it's Jacob.
- Where?
- Coming to the north gate.
- Leonesse...
Jacob...
- Mind the step.
- Jacob, what is it?
They've taken Lady Guinevere!
Taken?
Taken where?
A boat, sire.
From the north gate into the forest.
I have scouts and dogs out already.
Give me a battalion of guards.
- Give me the men.
- No, that's exactly what he wants.
- Take one brigade, now!
- Sire.
He'll not harm her, sire.
She's too valuable.
- He'll try to trade her first.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
I'd give my life for her.
But what if he asks for more?
Welcome to my palace...
My Lady.
I think we can release the lady from her bonds.
If she so wishes.
What's this?
Your dress is torn.
Ralph...
I gave orders that the lady was not to be harmed.
Your dress is quite spoiled.
You almost a queen.
Ralph.
Did you do this?
- Yes, My Prince.
- You see?
This is what Arthur doesn't understand.
Men don't want brotherhood, they want leadership.
Shall we?
This was once the greatest castle ever built.
Now grass grows in the halls where kings once feasted, and peasants cart away the walls to make shelters for their pigs.
- Such is glory.
- What do you mean to do with me?
Keep you till Arthur becomes reasonable.
He won't trade Leonesse for my life.
I'd rather die.
Arthur knows that.
Self-sacrifice is very easy.
But sacrificing someone you love puts your convictions to the test.
I'm sure Arthur will come round to the merits of compromise.
This is called an oubliette.
That's French for a place of forgetting.
Your quarters, My Lady.
No gates, no bars, no locks.
Just walls of air.
You can come out!
I'm unarmed and alone!
- Who are you?
- A messenger from the King.
- He came alone?
- Yes, My Prince.
- What is your message?
- Is Lady Guinevere unharmed?
She's unharmed.
I give you my word.
- I need to see it with my own eyes.
- My word isn't good enough?
I'm a common man.
I don't have much use for words.
He does have a message.
Take him to the pit, then bring him back.
- You've seen her.
Let's go.
- No.
- I still have a message to deliver.
- All right.
We'll drag you back.
Jump on!
Jump!
Come on!
Jump!
If the water can get out, so can we.
Come on.
No!
Hold on!
Shoot!
Why have we stopped?
- I'm tired.
- Never.
You battle in your dreams.
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.
Now, drink.
Again.
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I lived most of my life outdoors.
Don't you have a home?
No, I don't have a home.
Not for a long time.
- That must be hard.
- Why must it be?
I'm my own master.
I go where I please.
Why build a house for the warlords to burn?
Is that how it happened?
God save you from such a day.
How old were you?
Mother!
Father!
It was long ago.
- God save us all from such a day.
- He didn't save me.
- Ah, but he did.
- For what?
It's made you who you are.
A man who fears nothing and no one.
You can use that gift.
If not, you might as well have died.
You don't know how many times I've wished for that.
But you didn't die.
You lived.
- Tell me what to do.
- Your life is your own.
I give it to you.
You forget I'm to be married.
If you could freely do as you pleased, would you marry Arthur?
- I am free.
As free as you are.
- Prove it.
- How?
- Forget who you are.
Let all the world go away...
and all the people in it, but us.
Do what you want to do.
Here.
Now.
There she is!
Thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You can go.
You must have better things to do.
You have given me back my life.
I can at least give you your shirt.
- Tell me what you want.
It's yours.
- I did what any man would do.
You risked your life for another.
There is no greater love.
You have deceived me.
But now...
I know the truth.
You care nothing for yourself.
No wealth, no home, no goal, just the passionate spirit that drives you on.
God uses people like you.
Because your heart is open, you give all of yourself.
If you knew me better, you wouldn't say such things.
I take the good with the bad.
I can't love people in slices.
Now, no more protests.
Let me thank you in my own way.
They are welcoming you back.
We owe Lady Guinevere's life to one man.
Lancelot.
I believe he comes to Camelot for a purpose, even though he doesn't know it himself.
What I'm about to offer this man is already his.
One seat stands empty.
- You'd make him a knight, sire?
- I offer no life of privilege.
It's a life of service.
If you want it, it's yours.
- We don't know anything about him.
- Perhaps we should discuss...
Enough!
What do you say?
Will you join us?
My Lord, if I may speak?
I owe this man more than anyone here.
He deserves any honour you can give him.
But he doesn't belong in Camelot.
He's a man who goes his way alone.
In that freedom and solitude is his strength.
If you wish to honour him, as I do, with all my heart, let's honour him as he is.
Let him go, alone and free...
and with our love.
Well...
Lancelot?
Lady Guinevere understands me well.
But here, among you,
I have found something that I want more than freedom.
It would break my heart to leave you.
Bravo!
Then you'll join us?
- Yes.
- Welcome.
This is only the beginning.
Go pass this night in prayer, for tomorrow you'll be born again, into a new life.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Please leave Camelot.
- I want to be where you are.
You must not say such things to me.
Say nothing.
I will leave Camelot now, if you come with me.
- No.
- Then tell me you don't love me.
I don't love you.
Arise, Sir Lancelot.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere, my true and rightful queen.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere, and to protect her honour as my own.
Jacob...
Forgive me, milady.
Black Malagant has taken Leonesse.
Leonesse...
The gates are open.
- Make camp for the night.
- Where, sire?
There.
It's too exposed. sire.
We could never possibly defend it.
Sire.
They're not here.
There's no one here!
Draw!
Loose!
Charge!
Attack!
- Archers in position, sire.
- Hold position.
- Their left wing is falling back.
- Second battalion to the left!
Is our centre holding?
Charge!
- They're breaking, sire.
- Do not give chase.
- First battalion regrouped, sire.
- Sound the advance.
- They're running.
Do we follow?
- No.
Let them go.
On to Leonesse!
Well done.
Your sword...
Sir Lancelot.
No!
No!
- Come out.
- They're alive.
You're safe.
Don't be afraid.
We're glad you're safe.
There's a step.
Be careful.
God bless you, sir.
I'm so old now...
Can I go home now?
Can I go home now?
Yes.
Yes, you can go home now.
Bless you, milady.
Elise...
I've come to say goodbye, and wish you well.
It's been a long night.
You've not slept.
- Where will you go?
- Wherever the road leads.
When shall we see you again?
I don't think I'll be coming back.
Never?
Never.
I know what I must do now.
I never believed in anything before.
But I do believe in Camelot.
And I will serve it best by leaving.
Tell the King, I'll always remember that he saw the best in me.
And what shall I tell myself?
There was once a man who loved you too much to change you.
I'll not forget him.
I sheltered under a tree with him once... in the rain.
Lancelot...
- My Queen.
- I owe you a kiss.
I'm asking you.
Why?
Why?
The King asks for you, milady.
I ask you not to lie to me, even if you think you'll hurt me.
- Have you given yourself to him?
- No, My Lord.
Do you love him?
Yes.
- How did I fail you?
- You've never failed me, My Lord.
I saw your face as you kissed him.
Love has many faces.
I look on you differently, but not with less love.
When a woman loves two men, she must choose between them.
- I choose you.
- Your will chooses me.
- Your heart chooses him.
- My will is stronger than my heart.
Do you think I put so high a price on my feelings?
They'll pass.
My will holds me to my course through life.
As mine does me, and yet, all I have to do is look at you and everything I ever believed in fades to nothing.
- All I want is your love.
- You have it.
Do I?
Then look on me as you looked on him.
I gave one moment to Lancelot.
Yes, you're innocent.
But you love him!
Any more of this innocence and I'll go mad.
- I'll do whatever you tell me to.
- I don't know what to think.
I no longer see my way ahead.
Only fools dream of the one thing they can't have.
Forgive me.
What's to forgive?
I dreamed the dream of you.
It was a sweet dream while it lasted.
- Unlock the door.
- Sire.
- My Lord?
- I'll ask the questions.
Did you come to Camelot to betray me?
- No, My Lord.
- You desired her.
You pursued her.
- The Queen is innocent.
- Innocent?
I saw her in your arms.
I trusted you, and you betrayed me.
- I never meant to hurt you.
- You leave me nothing!
Nothing!
You will be charged with treason.
Defend yourself in court.
The law will judge you!
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, and the strength to make it endure.
Amen.
I was mistaken in Lancelot.
As a man, I may forgive...
As a king, I must see justice done.
There will be a trial tomorrow, in the great square.
- In the great square?
- Let's settle the matter privately.
You think the honour of Camelot is a private matter?
Am I to hide in dark corners as if I'm ashamed?
Open the gates.
I want everyone there.
Let every citizen see that the law rules in Camelot.
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, Queen of Camelot,
Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, Queen of Camelot, and Lancelot, Knight of the High Council, are charged in their own persons, and in collusion, with dishonour to the realm, and violation of the King's rights.
These crimes constitute an act of treason against Camelot, and the penalty under law is death.
- Sir Lancelot may speak.
- My words are for the King alone.
My Lord.
The Queen is innocent.
But if my life, or my death, serves Camelot.
Take it.
Do what you like with me.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Is it the King's wish that the Queen be questioned?
May God forgive me.
Is it the King's wish that the Queen be questioned?
- Who goes there?
- Who goes there?
Guards!
Close the gates!
Nobody move or Arthur dies!
My men control the city gates.
On every roof, I have men with burning torches!
I have only to lift my arm, and your golden city burns to ashes.
I am the law now!
You obeyed Arthur.
Now, obey me.
My people are unarmed, Malagant.
If it's me you want, here I am.
Look at him!
Look at the great King Arthur of Camelot.
He's a man waking up from a dream.
The strong rule the weak!
That's how your God made the world.
He makes us strong only for a while, so we can help each other.
My God makes me strong so I can live my life!
Arthur says, "Serve one another".
When will you live your own lives?
This is the freedom I bring you!
Freedom from his tyrannical dream!
Freedom from his tyrannical law!
Freedom from his tyrannical God!
I want your people to see you kneel before me here.
Kneel before me, or die.
Too proud, Arthur?
Do you think you serve your people better dead?
I have no pride left in me.
What I do now, I do for my people, and for Camelot.
And may they forgive me.
This is my last act as your king.
Do not be afraid.
All things change.
I am Arthur of Camelot.
I command you now, all to fight!
Fight!
Like you've never fought before!
No!
- Camelot lives!
- Burn everything!
No!
Be careful!
Come on!
Sword!
Camelot will never fall to the tyranny of Malagant!
- Is there no more we can do?
- I'm sorry.
- Lancelot...
- Yes, My Lord?
- Where's my sword?
- Here.
My truest... my First Knight.
Camelot is your home now.
You are the future...
The future of Camelot.
You take care of her for me.
Take care of her.
I feel it now, my love.
The sunlight.
It's in your eyes.
Good.
You wanna know how to win a sword fight?
How?
Be the only one with a sword.
Easy.
Give him a hand, he fought well.
Well done, John.
Winner takes all, my friends.
Winner takes all.
One more challenger and I'll be on my way.
Once in a lifetime, there comes a fighter so powerful, so fast, so fearless, that no man can touch him.
And while you're waiting for him to come along, you can practice on me.
You can take him on.
As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, somewhere there's a man who's better than me.
Could be here.
Could be today.
Go on.
Yeah.
It could be you.
- He looks strong.
Is he good?
- Try him and see.
Go on, Mark.
Only don't hurt him.
So you're Mark, are you?
That's my name.
I'm Lancelot.
You ready?
Ready.
Well, you don't have to kill me to win, you know.
Right.
Got tight hold of your sword?
Don't you worry about that.
Good.
Can I give you some advice?
What's that?
Don't drop your sword.
Is this your sword?
Well done.
Give him a hand.
Well done, Mark.
How did you do that?
How did he do that?
Was that a trick?
No, no trick.
It's the way I fight.
Could I do it?
Tell me.
I can learn.
You have to study your opponent, how he moves, so you know what he's gonna do before he does it.
I can do that.
You have to know that one moment in every fight when you win or lose, and you have to know how to wait for it.
I can do that.
And you have to not care whether you live or die.
Something's going on.
Come on, now.
Quickly.
Quickly.
- Quickly.
Hurry.
Quickly.
- Come on.
Get in.
Come on, get into the back.
Get in the back.
Shut the doors.
Shut the doors!
Faster.
Where's Daddy?
Burn it down.
We'll be burnt alive.
We need water.
Get water.
No, don't open the doors.
Wait till they've gone!
We'll all be dead by then.
Malagant.
Last night, men from this village crossed the border and killed three of my people.
In reprisal, I have destroyed your village.
The borderlands have been lawless long enough.
Know now that I am the law.
Quickly, now.
Mommy!
Come on.
Over here.
Go on, take it.
Take it.
Get it, get it.
There she is.
Mind the dog.
Over here, milady.
Come here.
Wait one moment.
Run with it, run with it!
Milady...
I know, I know.
I won't be much longer.
There's been another attack, milady.
Another border village burnt.
Anne, take my place.
Milady.
Thank you, Jacob.
Is it Malagant again?
Yes, milady.
A small group got away.
They've just arrived.
Are they being looked after?
They want to see you first, milady.
No, no, no, please.
Please, my poor people, after such a terrible journey, please.
We didn't know where else to turn, milady.
Our homes are gone.
They've destroyed everything.
They say we're outlaws.
They say we crossed the border.
Milady, we don't dare cross the border.
I know, I know.
It's lies, all lies.
He means to frighten us into submission.
Don't give in to him, milady.
We'll fight, every last one of us.
Don't worry, I'm not the yielding kind.
Jacob.
Milady?
Take these good people in and give them food and drink.
This evening, when you've rested, we shall all pray together for your village and for Lyonesse.
God keep you safe, milady.
And you.
Now go.
It is the third border village he's burned in a week.
What is it he wants, to destroy the whole world and be king of a graveyard?
He wants us to sign his treaty.
He thinks because my father's dead that no one will stand up to him.
Milady, even if your father were alive...
If Prince Malagant doesn't get what he asks, he has the power to take it.
Well, Oswald?
You say nothing.
You know what I think, child.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Prince Malagant must be answered, milady.
He will be.
I shall decide today.
Now leave me.
Oswald, stay.
It's all come so quickly.
I had hoped to have more time.
How much time does it take to know your own heart?
I know what I want.
I want to marry, and I want to live and die in Lyonesse.
But I can't have everything I want, can I?
Forgive me, child, but an offer of marriage from Arthur of Camelot...
Yes, I know.
You're right, of course.
So no more words.
Let it be done.
You accept the offer?
I shall marry Arthur of Camelot.
My dear child,
I was so proud to hold you in my arms at the hour of your birth.
I shall be prouder still to see you wed.
Poor Arthur.
The only dowry I bring him is a land in danger.
But I shall love him, Oswald.
You should, child.
I could never marry a man without love.
I've always known that.
Arthur wears his power so lightly, has such gentleness in his eyes.
I've never known anyone like him, Oswald.
How could I love anyone more?
Hyah!
Halt!
Halt!
It could be an ambush.
Look to the trees.
Look to the trees.
Knights take position.
Watch all sides.
Knights to positions.
- Protect the carriage.
- Move to the left.
Surround the carriage.
Circle in.
Don't break the line.
Wait.
Wait.
Now!
Follow!
Follow!
It's all right.
It's all right.
They're going.
Steady now.
Wait.
Watch your flank.
We've got to jump.
Come on, Elise.
Get up there.
Roll when you hit the ground.
Petronella, come on.
Come on, you have to.
No, I can't.
Hurry.
Save yourself.
It's me they'll follow.
No, I can't.
She must have gone to ground.
She can't be far.
There!
Don't move.
- Who are you?
- Who cares?
Kill him.
Shh.
What is it?
There were three.
Don't even breathe.
You, drop the sword.
All right.
But can I have her when you're finished with her?
You were after the woman?
Of course.
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in your whole life?
I don't know about that.
Don't tell me you don't want her.
Her soft skin, sweet lips, young firm body.
I have my orders.
So?
Who's to know?
No.
I should take her back.
How about I hold her for you, you hold her for me?
It won't take long.
I don't want any trouble.
This one's no trouble.
Look at her.
She wants it, all right.
What's she doing?
See for yourself.
Turn her around.
Look into her eyes.
See what she's got for you.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Now, what have you got for me, then?
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Why did you risk your life for me?
I didn't.
They could have killed you.
I'm not that easy to kill.
Do you know who I am?
Who are you?
Guinevere.
I'm the lady of Lyonesse.
Well?
Well what?
Doesn't it please you to know you saved the life of a lady?
I'd be just as pleased if you were a dairy maid.
A dairy maid couldn't reward you as I can.
If she was as pretty as you, she could give me all the reward I wanted.
What did I do?
Insulted me.
Now I've insulted you.
How dare you?
How dare you treat me like this?
I take it you know no better.
You have done me a good service today and I shall forget the matter.
Which way?
Don't know.
I've never been in this forest before.
Then how do you know it's leading to the road?
I'm guessing.
Guessing?
See the scavenger birds?
They're looking for small animals crushed by the passing wagons.
It's not far now.
About this reward...
My man will pay you when we find my escort.
I don't want money.
I think you should know I'm on my way to be married.
If you're on your way to be married, you're not married yet.
Not married yet, you're free.
I've given my word.
I don't want your word.
I want you.
I'm not to be had for the wanting, sir.
Why not?
If I want you, you want me...
You may find this childish arrogance impresses servant girls...
I can tell when a woman wants me.
I can see it in her eyes.
Not in my eyes.
You're afraid, aren't you?
I have nothing to hide.
Then look at me.
If there is any honor in you, promise me never to do that again.
I don't know about honor... but I promise you
I won't kiss you again until you ask me to.
And that I never will.
When do you get married?
On Midsummer's Day.
Before Midsummer's Day dawns, you'll ask me to kiss you again.
You insult me, and then you abandon me?
That's the road ahead.
And that, I presume, is your brave escort.
My child.
Thank the dear Lord.
Are my ladies safe?
Yes, yes.
Were you followed, milady?
No.
No, there's no one there.
Your new country awaits you, child.
If anything should happen at home...
I'll send word.
Never fear.
Send Jacob.
I want to know at once, good news or bad.
Promise me.
I promise you.
Lady Guinevere of Lyonesse.
Welcome to Camelot.
God be praised, you're safe.
Nothing shall ever harm you again.
My lord honors me with his kindness.
Your coming brings me a happiness I had not dared hope for.
My lord mustn't think too highly of me else I'm afraid he'll be disappointed.
You feel that too?
Then I shall just take you as I find you, if you'll do as much for me.
Well, Lyonesse will want to know if you've arrived safety.
John here will take any message you care to send.
My lord grants my wishes even before I speak them.
Tell my people I'm come safe into my new country.
Tell them you saw my eyes filled with tears of joy.
Already a queen.
Up!
Agravaine, what happened?
Ambush, sire.
Malagant?
Has to be.
Was Lady Guinevere in danger?
We were all in danger, sire.
It was a well-planned attack.
Two separate forces.
Lady Guinevere was in danger, sir, yes, in the course of the second...
You weren't prepared for the second attack?
They'd lost so many men in the first strike, sire, how could we guess they had a second force standing by, just watching their comrades die?
Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses, so long as he wins.
I'll not fail you again, sire.
We fought enough battles together to know that no one is perfect, but I need to know everything.
Sire.
Come.
I was still a boy when I first climbed this hill and saw what was to become my city.
I named it Camelot.
It's so beautiful it almost frightens me.
Why do you say that?
I was brought up to set no faith in finery.
"Beauty doesn't last," my father always said.
Well, yes, but I remember the way he looked at you, and I remember him saying:
"Do all fathers think their daughters are so beautiful?"
He never said that to me.
Camelot.
Welcome, Guinevere!
Lady Guinevere!
Ho!
Hey, good girl.
Good girl.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You saved me from a long ride.
God knows where she would have stopped.
She's a fine animal.
Fit for a queen, if she wants her wild.
I'm Peter.
King's stableman.
Lancelot.
Which king?
Which king?
The king.
Arthur of Camelot.
This beauty's supposed to be a gift for his new bride.
After all these years, there's those that swore he would never marry, but I knew better.
He was just waiting for the right one.
Like we all do.
There'll be some feasting today, I can tell you.
Come on.
The party's started.
Ready?
Come on, beat the gauntlet and meet the king.
Which one of you out there's got the heart of a lion?
Be the first to get right away through the gauntlet,
Come here, Robert.
And you'll be up there drinking ale as if he's your brother.
Come on.
Get up here.
Get padded up and beat the gauntlet.
What about you boys out there?
Yes.
Give your support to this brave young man.
God save the king.
Beat the gauntlet and meet our lovely queen.
Will you give the victor a kiss, milady?
How's that, boys?
Beat the gauntlet and you win a kiss from the Lady Guinevere, soon to be our lovely queen.
Who will it be?
Look at that.
Not like that, idiot.
No.
Come and get padded up first.
Get down.
You're mad!
You'll kill yourself.
Look at that.
Go on.
Yes.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Kiss.
Extraordinary.
Unbelievable.
What's your name?
Lancelot.
Lancelot.
We won't forget that name.
Your prize.
Ask me.
No.
Ask me.
Never.
I dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
I only have one heart to lose.
Come.
Well done.
Had you ever run the gauntlet before?
No, never.
So how did you do it?
It's not hard to know where danger is if you watch it coming.
Well, others have found it hard enough.
You're the first one to do it.
Perhaps fear made them go back when they should have gone forward.
And you felt no fear?
No.
I have nothing to lose, so, what have I to fear?
No home, family?
No.
Do you have a profession?
I live by my sword.
You fight for pay.
Yes.
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
I knew I could do it, so I did it.
Well, Lancelot, you're an unusual man.
I don't believe I've ever seen such a display of courage, skill, nerve, grace and stupidity.
Come.
Here we believe that every life is precious, even the lives of strangers.
If you must die, die serving something greater than yourself.
Better still, live and serve.
The Round Table.
Yes.
This is where the high council of Camelot meets.
No head, no foot.
Everyone equal, even the king.
"In serving each other, we become free."
That is the very heart of Camelot.
Not these stones, timbers, towers, palaces.
Burn them all and Camelot lives on.
Because it lives in us.
It's a belief we hold in our hearts.
Well, no matter.
Stay in Camelot.
I invite you.
Thank you, but I'll be on the road again soon.
What road?
Wherever a chance takes me.
I have no plans.
So you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?
Yes.
At the end of that hallway, there are two doors, one to the left, and one to the right.
How will you decide which door to take?
Left or right, it makes no difference.
It's all chance.
Then I hope chance leads you to the left, because it's the only way out.
Lancelot.
Just a thought.
A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing.
And if you love nothing, what joy is there in your life?
I may be wrong.
Peter.
Show us how she goes.
She's yours.
She's beautiful.
Peter thinks she's not suitable for a lady.
She's just the horse I would've chosen for myself.
I know.
How do you know?
Remember last spring at Lyonesse, when you joined your father and me on the hunt?
You were fearless.
My father's word was "reckless."
Yes, well, he was always sparing with his praise.
Come.
So much space, we could almost be alone.
Do you have secrets to tell me?
No.
No secrets.
Just a question to ask.
Do you want to marry me?
My lord?
You don't have to marry me because your father wanted it, or because your country needs it.
Camelot will protect Lyonesse whether you marry me or not.
Thank you.
You don't know what it means to me to hear you say that.
So you want to be released from the engagement?
No.
I want to marry you.
Not your crown or your army or your golden city.
Just you.
Just me?
Yes.
If you love me.
Do you remember this?
Of course.
You hurt it on the thorn bush in the hunt.
Hadn't thought it would leave such a scar.
Just a scratch, and it bled like a war wound.
I remember.
You took my hand in yours, and you wiped the blood away with the sleeve of your dress.
The sleeve still carries the stain.
I never thought until that moment how sweet it must be to be loved by one woman.
And for the first time in my life, I wanted...
What?
What all wise men say doesn't last.
What cannot be promised or made to linger any more than sunlight, but I don't want to die... without having felt its warmth on my face.
Marry the king, Guinevere, but love the man.
I only know one way to love, my lord.
And that is body and heart and soul.
I kiss the hurt that brought me your love.
Try her.
Shall I fetch her lady's saddle?
No need.
She's a rare beauty, sire.
Yes, she is.
So is the mare.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, the will to choose it, and the strength to make it endure.
Amen.
Amen.
My friends, as you all know, I am soon to be married.
- And about time too.
- Hear, hear.
We have had our share of war.
Now I look forward to quieter days.
But first, admit our guest.
Malagant.
Prince Malagant is here at my invitation.
May I congratulate the king on his forthcoming marriage.
I see my place hasn't been taken yet.
To think that I was once first among your knights.
You left this council of your own free will.
We each of us must follow our own road, my lord, and mine had further to go.
And where does your road take you, Malagant?
To Lyonesse?
Lyonesse is my neighbor.
I've offered the lady a treaty of friendship.
I still await an answer.
You call burning villages an act of friendship?
Well, yes, milady.
Since your honored father's death, our land has been more lawless by the day.
Were you yourself not attacked on the road here?
You know who attacked me.
I made it my business to know.
The bandits have been hunted down.
Justice has been done.
What justice?
You know no law higher than yourself.
"Armed forces to be given access to all Lyonesse."
"Troops to assist in the enforcement of law in all Lyonesse."
Do you want to sign this?
I'll never sign it.
There's your answer.
She says no.
She's very brave... now she's to be married.
So is Lyonesse to come under the protection of Camelot?
Is Lyonesse in need of protection?
Come, Arthur.
I'm here to settle this business.
We both know Lyonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let's say half each.
The lesser gives way to the greater, and what nation could be greater than Camelot, the land of justice and the hope of mankind?
Come, your hand on it.
We'll all live together as friends.
You offer me what isn't yours to give.
You all know me.
You know I'm a man of my word.
Don't make an enemy of me.
I mean no harm to Camelot.
You know the law we live by.
And where is it written "Beyond Camelot live lesser people, people too weak to protect themselves, let them die"?
Other people live by other laws, Arthur.
Or is the law of Camelot to rule the entire world?
There are laws that enslave men, and laws that set them free.
Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God, or we're just another robber tribe.
Your fine words are talking you out of peace and into war.
There's a peace that's only to be found on the other side of war.
If that battle must come, I will fight it.
And I. And I.
And I.
The great Arthur and his great dream.
No dream lasts forever.
What is the status of the army?
We have battalions under arms, two in reserve, sire.
I'll double the watch on all gates, sire.
Sire, I don't believe Malagant wants war with Camelot.
Arm the reserves.
He wants war, Mador, and he thinks he can win.
He wants Lyonesse as a buffer.
He wants Camelot.
He always has.
How soon could he attack?
There's no army within five days' march of Camelot.
So much for my quieter days.
Who approaches there?
I come from Lyonesse with a message for Lady Guinevere.
Enter.
Milady, it's Jacob.
Jacob?
Where?
Coming to the north gate.
Lyonesse...
Jacob?
Mind the step, milady.
Jacob, what is it?
What's happened?
Sound the alarm!
They've taken Lady Guinevere!
Get on it.
Go!
Go!
Let's go!
Taken?
Taken where?
What happened?
A boat, sire.
The north gate.
In which direction was she taken?
Into the forest, sire.
I have scouts out already, sire, and dogs.
Give me a battalion of guards.
No.
Give me the men and I'll get her back.
No, that's exactly what he wants.
Take one brigade, now.
Sire.
He'll not harm her, sire.
She's too valuable.
He'll try to trade her to get what he wants.
That's what I'm afraid of, Agravaine.
I'd give my life for her, but what if he asks for more than I can give?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Welcome to my palace... milady.
I think we can release the lady from her bonds... if she so wishes.
What's this?
Your dress is torn.
Ralf.
Yes, my prince?
I gave orders that the lady was not to be harmed.
But, my prince, I didn't...
Your dress is quite spoiled, milady.
You... almost... a queen.
Ralf.
My prince?
Did you do this?
Yes, my prince.
You see?
This is what Arthur doesn't understand.
Men don't want brotherhood, they want leadership.
Ho!
Shall we?
They say this was once the greatest castle ever built.
Now grass grows in the halls where kings once feasted, and peasants cart away the mighty walls, stone by stone, to make shelters for their pigs.
Ha!
Such is glory.
What do you mean to do with me?
I mean to keep you here until Arthur becomes more reasonable.
He'll not trade Lyonesse for my life.
I'd rather die, and Arthur knows that.
Of course, self-sacrifice is very easy.
It's having to sacrifice someone you love that puts your convictions to the test.
I'm sure you'll find Arthur will come round to the merits of compromise.
This is what's called an "oubliette."
That's French for "a place of forgetting."
Your quarters, milady.
No gates, no bars, no locks.
Just walls of air.
You can come out.
I'm unarmed and I'm alone.
Who are you?
A messenger from the king.
He came alone?
Yes, my prince.
So, what is your message?
I need to know that Lady Guinevere is unharmed first.
She's unharmed.
I give you my word.
I need to see with my own eyes.
My word isn't good enough for you?
I'm a common man, sir.
I don't have much use for words.
He does have a message for me.
Take him down to the pit, then bring him back here.
Give me a chance to finish my food.
All right, you've seen her.
Let's go.
No.
You have orders to kill me before I've delivered my message?
All right.
We'll drag you back.
Jump on.
Jump.
Down here.
Get him.
Come on.
Jump.
Jump!
If the water can get out, so can we.
Come on.
No.
Hold on.
Come on.
They're getting away!
Shoot.
Why have we stopped?
I'm tired.
Never.
You battle in your dreams.
What are you doing?
You'll see.
Now drink.
Again.
Where did you learn to do that?
Well, I've lived most of my life out in the open.
Don't you have a home?
No, I don't have a home.
Not for a long time.
That must be hard.
Why?
Why must it be?
I'm my own master.
I go where I please.
I've nothing to lose.
Why build a house for the warlords to burn?
Is that how it happened?
God save you from such a day.
How old were you?
No!
Mother!
No.
Father!
No.
It was long ago.
God save us all from such a day.
He didn't save me.
But he did.
For what?
It's made you who you are.
A man who fears nothing and no one.
You can use that gift for some good purpose.
If not, you might as well have died in the church with the others.
You don't know how many times I've wished for that.
But you didn't die.
You lived.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
Your life is your own.
I give it to you.
You forget I'm to be married.
If you were free to do as you pleased, would you marry Arthur?
I am free.
As free as you are.
Prove it.
How?
Forget who you are.
Let all the world go away, and all the people in it but you and me.
Do what you want to do.
Here.
Now.
On the other side.
You two, split up.
There she is!
Thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You can go.
I'm sure you have better things to do than dress me.
You have given me back my life itself.
The least I can do is give you your shirt.
My lord.
Tell me what you want and it's yours.
I did what any man would have done.
No, no.
You risked your life for another.
There is no greater love.
You have deceived me, but now I know the truth.
The truth is you care nothing for yourself.
Well, look at you.
No wealth, no home, no goal, just the passionate spirit that drives you on.
God uses people like you, Lancelot, because your heart is open.
You hold nothing back, you give all of yourself.
If you knew me better, you wouldn't say such things.
Come on.
I take the good with the bad, together.
I can't love people in slices.
Now, no more protests.
Let me thank you in my own way.
They're welcoming you back.
We owe Lady Guinevere's life to one man.
Lancelot.
And I believe he comes to Camelot for a purpose, even though he doesn't know it himself.
And what I'm about to offer this man is already his.
One seat stands empty.
You'd make him a knight, sire?
What I offer is no life of privilege, but a life of service.
And if you want it, it's yours, with all my heart.
Sire, we don't know anything about him.
They say he fights for money.
Sire, perhaps we should discuss...
Enough.
What do you say?
Will you join us?
Milord, if I may speak?
I owe this man more than anyone here, and he deserves any honor you can give him.
But he doesn't belong in Camelot.
Lancelot's a man who goes his way alone, and in that freedom and solitude is his strength.
If you wish to honor him, as I do, from the bottom of my heart, then let's honor him as he is and not as we would make him.
Let him go, alone and free, and with our love.
Well, Lancelot?
Lady Guinevere understands me well.
But here, among you,
I have found something that I want more than freedom.
I no longer know what life I am to live, only that it would break my heart to leave you.
Bravo.
Then you'll join us?
Yes.
Welcome.
This is only the beginning.
Go pass this night in prayer, for tomorrow at sunrise you'll be born again into a new life.
Why?
You know why.
Please leave Camelot.
I want to be wherever you are.
You must not say such things to me.
Well, what am I to say?
Nothing.
I will leave Camelot now if you come with me.
No.
Then tell me you don't love me.
I don't love you.
Arise, Sir Lancelot.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life...
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Amen.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere, my true and rightful queen, and to protect her honor as my own.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere, my true and rightful queen, and to protect her honor as my own.
Jacob.
Forgive me, milady, but Malagant has taken Lyonesse.
Halt!
Lyonesse.
The gates are open.
Make camp for the night.
Where, sire?
There.
It's too exposed, sire.
We could never possibly defend...
Sire.
It's straw.
They're not here.
There's no one here.
Draw!
Loose!
Charge!
Attack.
Attack!
Archers in position, sire.
We hold position.
Their left wing's falling back, sire.
Second battalion into the left flank.
Attack.
- Is our center holding?
- Yes, sire.
Charge.
They're breaking, sire.
Do not give chase.
Hold your ranks.
First battalion regrouped, sire.
Sound the advance.
They're running, sire.
Do we follow?
No, no.
Let them go.
On to Lyonesse!
Well done.
Your sword, Sir Lancelot.
No!
No!
- Come out.
- Come on.
- Lucky they're still alive.
- Hold my arm.
Hold my arm.
You're safe.
Don't be afraid.
Come along, miss.
Take my arm.
I love you, milady.
- Yes, we're glad you're safe.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
Food and water for you all.
There's a step.
Be careful.
Child, all the bad men are gone now.
Take my arm, child.
It's all right, it's safe now.
God bless you, sir.
God bless you.
It's all right now, Father.
We're free, we're free.
- So old now.
- Yes, we have water.
Can I go home now?
Can I go home now?
Yes.
Yes, you can go home now.
- Go to your mother.
- Bless you, milady.
Bless you.
Elise...
I've come to say goodbye and wish you well.
It's been a long night.
You've not slept.
Where will you go?
Don't know.
Wherever the road leads.
And when shall we expect to see you again?
I don't think I'll be coming back.
Never?
Never.
See, I know what I must do now.
I never believed in anything before.
But I do believe in Camelot.
And I will serve it best by leaving.
Tell the king I'll always remember that he saw the best in me.
And what shall I tell myself?
That there was once a man who loved you too much to change you.
I'll not forget him.
I sheltered under a tree with him once... in the rain.
Lancelot.
My queen.
I owe you a kiss.
I'm asking you.
Why?
Why?
The king asks for you, milady.
I ask you not to lie to me, even if you think you'll hurt me.
Have you given yourself to him?
No, my lord.
Do you love him?
Yes.
How did I fail you?
You've never failed me, my lord.
I saw your face as you kissed him.
Love has many faces.
I may look on you differently, but not with less love.
When a woman loves two men, she must choose between them.
I choose you.
Your will chooses me.
Your heart chooses him.
Then you have the best of it.
My will is stronger than my heart.
Do you think I put so high a price on my feelings?
Feelings left for a moment and the moment passes.
My will holds me steady to my course through life.
As mine does me, and yet all I have to do is look at you, and everything I ever believed in fades to nothing.
And all I want is your love.
You have it.
Do I?
Do I?
Then look on me as you looked on him.
I gave one moment to Lancelot.
Yes, you're innocent.
But you love him!
Any more of this innocence and I'll go mad.
I'll do whatever you tell me to.
I don't know what to think or feel anymore.
I no longer see my way ahead.
Only fools dream of the one thing they can't have.
Forgive me.
What's to forgive?
I dreamed the dream of you.
It was a sweet dream... while it lasted.
Unlock the door.
Sire.
My lord?
I'll ask the questions.
Did you come to Camelot to betray me?
No, my lord.
You desired her.
You pursued her.
The queen is innocent.
Innocent?
I saw her in your arms.
I trusted you, loved you, and you betrayed me.
I never meant to hurt you.
You leave me nothing.
Nothing!
My lord...
No!
You will be charged with treason under our laws.
Defend yourself in court.
The law will judge you.
May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, the will to choose it, and the strength to make it endure.
Amen.
Amen.
I was mistaken in Lancelot.
As a man, I may forgive.
As a king, I must see justice done.
There will be a public trial tomorrow at noon in the great square.
Sire, the queen...
In the great square?
Better to settle the matter in private, sire.
You think the honor of Camelot is a private matter?
Am I to hide in dark corners as if I'm ashamed?
Open the city gates.
I want everyone there.
The people will know the truth.
Let every citizen see that the law rules in Camelot.
Guinevere, lady of Lyonesse, queen of Camelot,
Guinevere, lady of Lyonesse, queen of Camelot, and Lancelot, knight of the high council, are charged in their own persons, and in collusion, one with the other, with dishonor to the realm and violation of the king's rights under law.
These crimes constitute an act of treason against the kingdom of Camelot, and the penalty under law is death.
Sir Lancelot may speak to the charges.
What I have to say is for the king alone.
My lord... the queen is innocent.
But if my life or my death
serves Camelot... take it.
Do what you like with me.
Brother to brother, yours in life and death.
Is it the king's wish that the queen be questioned by this court?
May God forgive me.
Is it the king's wish that the queen should be questioned by this court?
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
- You on the roof, who goes there?
- Guards!
Close the gates.
Close the city gates!
Get back.
Come on, now.
Get back there.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Nobody move or Arthur dies.
My men control the city gates and every exit from this square.
On every roof, I have men with burning torches.
I have only to lift my arm and your golden city burns to ashes.
I am the law now.
You obeyed Arthur, and now you'll obey me.
My people are unarmed, Malagant.
If it's me you want, here I am.
Look at him.
Look at the great King Arthur of Camelot.
Ha!
He's a man waking up from a dream.
The strong rule the weak.
That's how your God made the world.
God makes us strong only for a while, so that we can help each other.
My God makes me strong so I can live my life.
Arthur says to you, "Serve one another."
Well, when are you gonna start living for yourselves?
Now, this is the freedom I bring you.
Freedom from Arthur's tyrannical dream, freedom from Arthur's tyrannical law, freedom from Arthur's tyrannical god.
I want your people to see you kneel before me here.
No.
No.
Kneel before me or die.
Too proud, Arthur?
You think you can better serve your people better dead?
I have no pride left in me.
What I do now I do for my people and for Camelot.
And may they forgive me.
This is my last act as your king.
Do not be afraid.
All things change.
I am Arthur of Camelot.
And I command you now, all... to fight!
Fight like you've never fought before!
Never surrender!
Never surrender!
Fight like you've never...
No!
Camelot lives.
Burn it.
Burn everything.
Go!
Get him inside.
Careful.
Go on!
Fight for Camelot!
Come on.
Fight for King Arthur!
Fight for Camelot!
Sword.
Please, no!
You fool!
Camelot will never fall to the tyranny of Malagant!
Is there no more we can do?
I'm sorry.
Lancelot.
Yes, my lord?
Where's my sword?
Here.
My truest, my first knight.
Camelot is your home now.
You are the future...
The future of Camelot.
You take care of her for me.
Take care of her.
I feel it now, my love.
The sunlight.
It's in your eyes.
Oh, Tess.
I'll never get tired of seeing the sunrise.
Neither do I, baby.
It's always good to get up with the sun.
It's a wonder more people don't get up to see the dawn.
It's not the sunrise he's up for.
Some people can't stand the silence of the night.
The nighttime has its own special beauty.
Not for him.
James Mackey.
He just gets up with the sun to start running again.
MONICA:
He looks like quite an athlete.
Well, he is a good runner.
But that's not the kind of running I'm talking about.
Did you ever hear the story about the man who was afraid of the lions?
Well, he was so scared, he ran, and he ran, and he ran, and he kept looking behind him to see if a lion was catching up to him.
And he looked over his shoulder so much he didn't see where he was going, and one day, guess what he ran smack dab into?
A lion.

JAMES:
Oh, yes, sir.
He's a terrific kid.
A letter from you sure would shake the walls down.
Oh, yes, sir.
Your name is still real good around these parts.
WOMAN:
I'll call you from the car later then.
Hello.
I'm here to see Sheriff Mackey.
Jim!
The college boards are coming up so we have to know pretty soon, sir.
Right.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that, sir.
Thank you.
All right.
All right!
What did he say?
I want you to call Matt's school and have them fax a copy of his grades over to Congressman Atwater right away.
He's going to do it?
He likes what he sees, he's going to write the letter of recommendation to Annapolis.
I'm on it.
I'm so proud of that boy,
I don't know what to do.
Oh, Jim, this is...
Hello.
I'm Monica.
Hello, Monica.
What brings you to Tapford?
I'm doing a story for theglobe.
Reporter down from the capital, huh?
We have them for breakfast, don't we, Vicky?
Well, don't hold it against me.
I'm just a freelancer.
What can I do for you?
I'm doing a profile on local heroes.
Oh?
Well, you were given the Governor's Medal of Valor.
Well, that was three years ago.
Why do you want to do an article on that now?
Well, this is just a follow-up story, a "where are they now" sort of thing.
I'll tell you where he is.
He's on cloud nine.
His kid's going to get into Annapolis.
That would make a great angle.
Father and son, yesterday's hero, tomorrow's hero?
Yeah, but that just seems like old news to me.
Not the way I'm going to write it.
You go on, let Monica ride with you.
Please.
I won't be any trouble.
All right.
I can't fight off both of you.
I'll get my hat.
So when my wife died, something about big city life didn't work anymore.
I took Matthew, packed a few things and moved to Tapford.
It certainly is a wonderful place to bring up a boy.
WOMAN:
Hi, Sheriff.
Sure is.
We got fishing down at the lake, meadows for track runs, great local schools.
Pretty much everything we need is right here on Main Street.
It's lovely.
Mm-hmm.
Is that the bank that earned you your medal?
Yeah, that's it.
Tell me, Sheriff Mackey, what's it like to be a hero?
My partner, Nick Hansen, died in that holdup.
I know.
This kid was cleaning the bank out.
He had everybody on the floor ready to execute half the town.
He had one woman by the throat with a pistol to her head.
Nick and I went in together.
The kid shot Nick.
And you shot the boy?
He couldn't have been more than 19.
Next thing I know, they're pinning a medal on me.
Calling me a hero.
It's not your fault that your partner died.
You risked your life to save him and think of all the others that you saved.
Yeah...
Yeah.
What the...?
Be right back, Monica.
Come on, man.
Pass it back out.
Dad.
I'm driving down the street thinking my son's in the library, and what do I see?
He's spending the last few hours of his study time out here in a damn basketball game.
Listen, dad, I was just...
I was taking a break.
No, there are no breaks, Matthew.
The boards are tomorrow.
You got that?
Tomorrow.
You're fresh out of time.
There are no breaks.
Jim, Jim.
He has studied enough.
If anybody is ready for the boards, it's Matthew.
Mike, I know you're a good man and you mean well, but you stay out of my business.
Jim, I'm sorry, but I've got to say it, you are too hard on your son.
Are you telling me how to raise my boy?
No...
You telling me what's best for my son?
No, I just think you...
Don't think.
They don't pay you to do that.
They pay you to coach, so you stick to what you do best and leave my son to me, huh?
Excuse me for interrupting, but I think there's been a wee bit of a misunderstanding.
You see, the sheriff here was given some very exciting news about his son today.
Hello, Matthew.
And in his eagerness to share it,
I think he got a little worked up.
I was out of line, Mike.
I apologize.
It's all right, Jim.
Good.
So now are you going to tell Matthew the news?
Congressman Atwater came through for us.
You got the recommendation, Matthew.
That's great, Dad.
What, no jumping up and down?
No whooping and hollering?
Matthew, we're talking Annapolis here, the Naval Academy.
That's top of the line, son.
Boy, I'm so proud of you I could bust.
Now, look, you gather up your stuff and get on back to the library.
I'm sorry for the trouble.
You boys get on back to your game.
Man, your dad's hard-core.
I guess if they tell you you're a hero, you can get away with anything.
Shut up, man.
He knows what he's doing.
You know, I try to keep a lid on my temper, but hell, when it comes to Matthew, there's nothing that makes my blood boil more than some joker trying to tell me what's right for my son.
He seems like a very special boy.
Yeah.
A shrine to the son, so little about the father.
Well, the son's a lot more interesting than the old man ever was.
Excellence in track, football, math, English.
You're right, he is quite a boy.
You know, people like Mike on the basketball court, they say I'm too hard on him.
But I know what hard is, and I know what discipline is.
The two of them are interchangeable.
If you want your son to be successful, you've got to give him discipline.
The only way to do that is to be hard.
So discipline is Sheriff Mackey's secret weapon for success, huh?
Well, look at me.
I'm up every morning by 4:00, jogging on the road by 5:00, in at work by 6:00.
Efficient but exhausting.
When do you sleep?
Sleep?
I don't believe in sleep.
Sleep is eight wasted hours of hot-air ballooning.
Nothing gets done.
Where I come from, people don't always have to be busy.
Sometimes they just sit back and enjoy the peace.
We come from two different places, Monica.
All of the places I've been don't know the first thing about peace.
In fact, you show me someone who claims they live in peace,
I'll show you a liar.
Yeah, I miss him every day.
(door opening)
Matt?
Is that you?
Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
Oh, you remember Monica.
Hello.
I heard wonderful things about you.
Well, I hope you didn't believe them.
JAMES:
Monica here is a reporter.
They sent her down here to do a story on your old man.
Oh.
That's great.
Well, I got dinner burning.
Dad?
Is it all right if I eat in my room tonight?
Matt, we got company.
Oh, don't mind me.
I'm kind of nervous about tomorrow.
I was hoping maybe I could cram a few more hours.
Well, get cracking.
Good luck tomorrow.
I look at that boy and everything else
I've done in my life hardly seems to matter.
Can I quote you?
You're damn straight.
TESS:
Any boy that studies that much is looking for answers that he cannot find in a book.
He's so quiet and well-behaved.
But there's something else too-- a sadness.
TESS:
He's so caught up in what his father wants him to be, that he hasn't had time to find out who he really is.
MONICA:
His father is so proud of him.
TESS:
Honey, there is nothing more dangerous than a man taking pride in the wrong thing.
Hey, Mackey.
You got them, man?
It's a done deal.
Mackey?
One thing I don't get.
You could take this test in Chinese and still come out making A's.
Why buy the answers?
This one's too important.
There's no room for mistakes.
(bell rings)
(cooing)
Matthew?
Will you please put your pencil down and join me outside in the hall?
(cooing)
Matthew, you are a good student.
I don't know why you felt you had to cheat.
I'm sorry.
It's too late for that.
I have to disqualify you.
The honors board meets Friday morning.
I want you to be there.
(bell rings)
And bring your father.
May I have your attention?
Would everyone please take their seats?
This is a time when all of you face big decisions.
Now, you took the boards this morning.
And while you wait for your scores, trying to figure out what college to attend, what career path to follow, and what an uncertain future holds for you.
Now, you may be asking yourself "Do I have what it takes?
Do I have what it takes to make it in the real world?"
Well, today I've provided a very special speaker to talk to you about those hard choices.
He's a man who has understanding because he has been there.
He's made his choices and he has made them well.
Please help me welcome someone that we all know and respect,
Sheriff James Mackey.
(applause)
Thank you and good afternoon.
Principal Richards asked me here today to give you a motivational speech.
I can't do that.
I can't give any of you anything.
Motivation, direction, inspiration, those are all things that only you can give yourselves.
You've got to have a vision for yourself and then you've got to put in the hard time.
Because when you do, when you use self-discipline, you don't just achieve excellence, you get the rewards that come with it.
Now take as an example one of your own classmates,
Matthew Mackey.
I grant you, he's my son, and I won't stand here for one minute and say
I'm not proud of him.
But he put in the hard time.
And now it's paying off.
His grades have earned him a recommendation from a congressman, and now we're talking Annapolis.
The bottom line is, do the hard work and the doors will swing open.
(whispers):
Want to bet?
Now this isn't just happening because Matthew sat around for four years on his hands.
It's happening because he's a young man who knew what he wanted and he went for it.
He's the one who finally got the dream.
And I'm here to tell you, when you get the dream, the dream gives back to you.
Hey, Mackey.
Wait up.
Hey!
Hey, what did you tell Randall?
I didn't tell her anything.
How did you say you got the answers?
I didn't say anything, man.
Yeah, well, as far as anybody's concerned, you stole those answers all by yourself.
Got it?
Hey, just remember.
Whatever your father can do to you,
I can do worse.
I read that you're speaking at the Chamber of Commerce tomorrow afternoon.
Thank you.
No, you can't come.
Oh, come on.
I'm telling you, it's gonna be pretty boring.
Thank you.
I'd love to.
I'll have the chairman put you at my table.
You can sit with Matthew.
You know, you certainly do make an awful lot of speeches.
Well, I'm the local hero.
I guess that dubious honor comes with a price, huh?
It seems like an awfully high price.
And it puts you under an awful lot of pressure to always do the right thing and be the right thing.
Well, after Nick died,
I wanted to find a way to give his death some meaning.
What about Matthew?
What about him?
It must be so hard for him to live in your shadow.
Nah, he's got a whole future of his own to live.
Yeah, but it seems to be putting him under a lot of pressure, too.
You know, I'm worried about him.
Look, he's waiting for the results on the college boards, he's thinking about Annapolis.
His whole life is changing right under his feet.
College is a wonderful goal, but he's still a boy, you know.
He needs to be able to play basketball and see a movie.
He needs to relax.
Monica, trust me on this, all right?
That kid is at the top of his game-- class valedictorian, captain of the football team and the basketball team.
I know, but he's exhausted.
You know, he spends so much time trying to please you, that he never takes the time to think what it means to please himself.
Don't tell me about my son, all right?
I know him like the back of my hand.
If he's feeling any pressure at all right now, he can handle it.
Okay?
Sure.
Let me grab my stuff for the dry cleaners and we'll head right back to the office, huh?
Okay.
It's here.
Hot dog, it's here!
(chuckles)
Yeah, this is it.
Congressman Atwater not only wrote the letter of recommendation, he wrote it with honors.
(door opens)
That's Matt.
Come on.
(door closes)
Hey, son.
How could you do that to me today, Dad?
What?
Come on, Dad,
I haven't even been accepted into Annapolis and you're telling everybody that I'm in.
I mean, what am I supposed to do if I don't make it?
Did you ever think of that?
Matt, I apologize if I embarrassed you.
Son, it's just that I'm so proud of you that it's hard to keep it in.
Here, maybe this will cheer you up.
You're in, Matthew.
You made it.
I told you, you could do it, son, and you did.
You did it, Matthew.
I don't believe you.
You opened my mail.
But, Matt, I...
Dad, you don't give me any privacy.
You don't let me have anything that's mine.
Don't you use that tone with me, not after all I've done for you, boy.
You don't get it, do you?
No, what I get, Matthew, is that this, this recommendation is going to change your life, give you opportunities that most kids would sell their souls for.
I can't talk to you.
What's gotten into that boy?
(door closes)
Maybe you should go up and talk to him.
No, he's just tired.
Let him sleep it off.
(fire crackling)
(coos)
(coos)
(gunshot)
Okay, let's go.
Move it!
Okay, watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out.
Okay, heads up, folks.
We need labs, stat.
Yes, sir.
James?
Monica.
I was, uh...
I was trying to sleep and I heard this gunshot.
I went down in the basement and I found him...
Well, what happened?
I don't know.
He had my gun.
What the hell was he doing down there in the middle of the night with my gun?
Tom?
Jim, I'll let you know as soon as I do.
What have we got?
17-year-old male, gunshot wound to the left temporal area, probably self-inflicted.
Unresponsive at scene, stable vitals on route.
Okay, send off a crit, electrolytes, ABG, type and cross for two.
Ready?
One, two, three.
He's got one at a cubical line.
Okay, we need two 16-gauge lines.
Let's hook him up and hyperventilate him.
I'm on it.
Can I have someone help me with his head, please?
Patrick, that's you.
Cut that.
Cut that.
Okay.
Let's hit him up with 75 of Mannitol.
I also need a new set of vitals and a SAT.
BP 100/60, heart rate 54,
SAT 92.
I feel a skull fracture.
It looks non-penetrating.
Come on, here we go.
There are medals out there waiting for you, and bright skies and loving friends and a life so full, you can't even begin to imagine.
Oh, Matthew, God loves you so much.
Now fight.
Fight for yourself.
Pupils are reacting bilaterally.
Call radiology.
We need a stat head CT.
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Parrish to CICU.
(phone rings)
Tom.
How's my boy doing?
He'll make it.
Oh, thank God.
Thank you, Tom, thank you.
Jim, he'll make it, but I'm not gonna lie to you, it's gonna be a hard road back.
All right.
Please.
The force of the bullet caused an injury to the brain.
There's a contusion.
It's like a small blood clot that's centered right at the speech area.
Matthew's speech is severely impaired.
Now, whether that impairment is permanent or temporary can only be determined over time, but we're gonna get him right into therapy and rehab, okay?
We'll get him back.
He'll make it back-- he's-he's gonna be fine, Tom.
That's the attitude we need.
Yeah.
Tom, when can I bring him home?
Well, Jim... the boy's been shot in the head, and... even if he's out of the woods with that, he's still gonna have to spend some time up in psychiatric.
What?
It's hospital policy whenever there's a suicide attempt.
Suicide?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.
Oh, no, no, that's not possible.
Jim, I know it's hard to hear that.
No.
No son of mine would try to commit suicide.
But, Jim, the only thing that matters is Matthew needs help.
Now, we can give him the psychiatric attention he needs right now, but you, you are gonna have to follow up on your own.
Now, I'm gonna give you the name of a very good family therapist, and I want the both of you to go together.
Listen to me.
The more involved you are in Matthew's recovery, the better.
Where's the note?
What note?
Well, if you're gonna stand there and tell me my son tried to commit suicide, then you damn well better produce a suicide note.
Don't do this.
Come on, you're a cop.
You know there isn't always a note.
Look... you either produce the suicide note or you stop slandering my son's name, you got that?
(over P.A.):
Dr. Levy, please call extension 434.
Dr. Levy, please call extension 434.
(steady beeping)
Hello, Matthew.
Oh, no.
Matthew, you can't think that.
We couldn't let you die.
No, you don't.
You have so much to live for.
It's okay.
I'm an angel.
I can hear you.
Nothing I do is good enough.
Good enough for your father?
He's not happy unless I'm the best.
And I can't be all the time.
I mean, if I'm on the team, he won't just let me play, he wants me to be team captain.
And if I win an award, he wants it to be first place.
And the boards, if I get a 1,500, it's not good enough.
He wants a 1,600.
Is that why you cheated on your test?
Does he know?
Not yet.
But you should tell him yourself.
I can't.
He'll kill me.
Is that why you tried to get there first?
Maybe.
Oh, Matthew, it's not as bad as it seems.
You and your father, you can work this through.
(door opens)
Yes, I do know your father, and I know you, and I believe in you both.
What do you think?
Well, his head is going to be all right-- it's his heart I'm worried about.
Well, the sins of the father have definitely been visited upon the son.
And the father has to heal before the son can.
And it had better be fast, because that boy will try again.
It seems so unfair.
How can he expect Matthew to live up to him?
Oh, it's deeper than that.
He expects that boy to redeem him.
(knocking)
(sighs)

Monica.
He needs to see you.
What good would that do?
When are you going to look past your own pain to see that your son is suffering so much it's killing him?
Matthew had an accident;
we all have accidents.
Matthew tried to kill himself.
No, he didn't!
(sighs)
You claim to be a hero, and yet you can't find the courage to save your own son?
I know my son.
My son would never try to kill himself.
I found this in the basement.
It's addressed to you.
James, Matthew is in that hospital bed because he was caught cheating on the college boards.
His teacher disqualified him.
He was about to lose everything.
He couldn't talk to you, and... he thought there was no other way out.
But I don't understand this.
He-he doesn't have to cheat.
No, of course he doesn't.
But you made him feel that being good wasn't good enough, and he was afraid that he wouldn't live up to your expectations.
He wanted to die because he was too ashamed to come to you with the truth.
(crying):
Oh, God.
Matthew needs you to forgive him, and he needs to know that you love him-- not because he's the best, but because he's your son.
I can't.
I...
I can't.
I love my son more than I love my own life, but I'm the last person in the world that can help him.
(gasps)
(fire crackling)
Monica?
So you don't get up at night out of discipline, do you?
No.
Come with me.
What the...?
I know what's been haunting you, James.
If you hide the lie for long enough, you start to think that it's the truth.
Who are you?
I'm an angel.
A what?
An angel.
An angel.
Boy, that's great.
That, that's just great.
I don't know whether to fall on my knees or take you in and book you.
I'm not kidding and you know it.
You've been running and running, looking over your shoulder, waiting for this moment for a long time.
Secrets are such dangerous things.
The closer you hold on to them, the farther away you push everyone else to keep them safe.
But do you know what, James?
There are no such things as secrets.
MAN:
Back off!
Get down!
You, over there!
Shut up!
Back off!
Stay down!
Don't move!
(door opens)
(shouts)
(cocks gun)
Most people will never know what really happened that night.
But no matter how hard you try to hide it, the truth is still the truth.
And God knows what the truth is.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
God knows that.
But now it's time to tell your son.
WOMAN (over PA):
Resident on call to ER.
Resident on call to ER.
Matthew, when your mother died,
I promised her I would give you the best.
I knew it was going to be hard raising you on my own, but I never doubted I could do it because I knew how much I loved you, son.
And I do.
I love you more than anything in my life.
Is that it, Matt?
You...
You didn't think you were good enough?
Son, the reason I push you so hard is because I don't want you to be anything, anything like me.
I know you... you think you let me down.
I'm the one who let you down.
Matthew, uh...
Nick died in that holdup because of me, not in spite of me.
I froze.
Yes, son.
I-I was scared.
I let Nick take that bullet for me and I lied about what really happened.
People saw me holding Nick's gun and assumed that I shot that kid.
I didn't.
Nick shot him.
Nick's the hero.
Yeah, I know, Matt,
I should have come forward and told the truth, but after all the commotion died down, they were already calling me a hero.
I couldn't bear to...
to tell them... the truth-- how much of a coward I really was.
Son...
I should have died in that holdup.
And knowing that the only way I could live was to think about you.
I thought the reason God kept me alive... was because you needed me.
Oh, Matt.
(sighs)
It's funny, isn't it, how sometimes you have to be silent before you can communicate.
(sniffling)
I am not crying.
Okay.
This is the name of a good family counselor.
Just tell him I sent you.
Tom?
Thanks for everything.
Hey, I'm here if you need me.
Monica.
How's Matthew?
I told him the truth.
I think he heard me.
And you?
I still have another speech to give.
So many speeches.
This is the last one.
I know it will be a good one.
When Hank told me the Chamber of Commerce wanted me to speak at this, the annual luncheon, I was honored.
At events like this,
I'm usually asked to speak about courage and heroism.
Today I need to speak about the truth.
Yesterday, I almost lost my son.
He was in trouble, and I was so busy taking care of myself, that I couldn't see how much he needed me.
But his pain is...
It made me see that it is time to come forward.
It's time for me to be courageous and to tell the truth.
I'd like to set the record straight.
I am not the hero you think I am.
The real hero died in a bank robbery three years ago.
He was a good cop.
A respected member of this community and the best friend I ever had.
He's a man who truly deserves this medal of valor.
My partner...
Nick Hansen.
Are you all right?
(voice breaking):
I will be.
Now don't you go getting emotional on me.
You can't go around crying over every job.
Oh!
You're a fine one to talk.
Save one for me.

# As time goes by #
Do you know something?
I feel redundant.
- Feel what?
- Redundant.
- I'm only reading the paper.
- No, not here, I mean at the office.
I feel it more and more.
I think of something to do only to find Judy or Sandy have already done it.
That's good.
They're showing initiative.
I wish they wouldn't show so much.
You don't think they're trying to tell me something?
I don't think they're plotting to overthrow you.
You don't think they're trying to tell me I'm yesterday's woman?
- Isn't that rather excessive?
- I don't know.
- Perhaps I am.
- I think of you as my child bride.
- Oh, do you?
- Well, not really, of course.
But I certainly don't think of you as yesterday's woman.
- It's you coming back into my life.
- Are you saying I've aged you?
I'm saying that before, you see...
I'm not saying that work was everything I had in my life.
- No, of course not.
- But it was everything I had in my life.
Now...
Why don't you retire?
- Retire?
- It's not a dirty word.
To do what, take up crochet or sequence dancing?
You're being excessive again.
For a start, we could spend more time together.
Have you retired, then?
- I'm not sure, really.
- What if your miniseries is a success?
- Fat chance.
- Never mind fat chance.
What if it is and they ask you to write something else?
- The money's good.
- Exactly.
You could be away working and I'd be stuck back here doing my crochet.
Crochet is your invention, and why am I suddenly away working?
- I work at home.
- You don't like being interrupted at work.
No, but I'd still be here, wouldn't I?
This sofa would be here.
I don't look on it as great company.
I probably won't ever be asked to write anything again.
- That's a probably.
- Life's made up of probablys.
That's one of those words.
Say it a few times and it ceases to be a real word.
- Probably, probably, probably.
- You've gone right off the track.
I'm not sure there ever was a track.
All I said was that I felt a bit redundant at the office.
Which is where we came in.
Don't get me wrong, I like being married.
I'm very pleased to hear it.
But I'm not a little-wifey sort of person.
I'm not really sure that I'm a little-hubby sort of person.
Meaning you'd like to go on working.
- If a miracle turns up, yes.
- But you'd like me to retire.
It was only a suggestion.
- You started this.
I was reading the paper.
- What were you reading?
- An article about crochet, actually.
- Oh!
Don't!
Hello, love.
How was the film?
Oh, it was sad, you know, a bit of a weepie.
- Did you enjoy the film, Sandy?
- Oh, very much.
Funniest thing I've seen in ages.
- You did see the same film?
- I just said it was a bit of a weepie.
- Clang!
- I don't have to know where you were.
All right.
We didn't go and see a film.
It's just we get so sick and tired of going to see flats and coming back and saying how awful they were.
So you saw a flat.
And?
It was awful.
Garden flat, it said.
You should've seen the garden.
Six square feet of concrete with a shrub in a tub.
- A dead shrub.
- It was like a tiny prison exercise yard.
- Hello, you two.
How was the film?
- They've been to see a flat.
- My memory must be going.
- No, we fibbed.
- I see.
- Aren't you going to ask us why?
No, I don't think I will.
- So, what was the flat like?
- Ideally suited... to manic depressives.
- Well, I think you should give up looking.
- Yes, that's what I said.
Lionel has got used to living with a monstrous regiment of women.
I'll ignore that.
The fact is that we may not be here much longer.
You're not talking about dying?
I'm talking about Rocky and Madge's house.
Well, my house soon.
Jean and I might be moving down there.
- Permanently?
- I don't see why not.
- Your mother's thinking of retiring.
- Retiring?
- Are you really?
- Don't let your supper get cold.
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.
I'd like one of those planes that tows a big banner behind it.
- I'm not supposed to understand that, am I?
- Big red letters. "Jean is retiring."
Perhaps you'd like to announce it on Radio 2.
Two people I mentioned it to.
Two people.
I didn't say retiring.
I said "is thinking of retiring".
- Who says I am?
- You did.
No, I did not.
All I said was I felt a bit redundant at the office.
Suddenly, I find you issuing official statements.
Where are you going?
To retract the official statement which I never made.
Look, we don't want Jean to agonise about which one of us gets her job.
We could run the office between us.
Yeah, of course we could.
Which one of us gets her desk?
Forget everything I said.
Jean has absolutely no intention of retiring.
Oh.
But I am thinking about it.
- We're off to the shops.
- Oh, right.
You won't forget...
- Lionel's custards tarts?
No.
- They're top of the list.
Right, bye, then.
Well?
- Look, Mum, we don't want you to retire.
- No, of course we don't.
We don't want you to feel any pressure from either of us.
Just because we're young, vibrant, ambitious.
- We'd miss you.
- Professionally?
- Of course we would.
- A lot.
- That came out very quickly, didn't it?
- All right.
If you want an honest answer, I suppose we could get by without you.
- Oh!
- That doesn't mean to say we want to.
It wouldn't be the same.
Less bullying.
- But it wouldn't be the same.
- Oh, go shopping!
I'll go.
Truly, Mum.
We really don't want you to retire.
I know.
But Lionel does.
Oh, go on.
Hi, Li.
Are we in business, or are we in business?
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Hello, Alistair.
- Hey, hey.
- We're going shopping.
Something soft and sexy, I hope.
Depends on how you feel about custard tarts.
Bye.
Bye.
- Now, was that called for?
- Yes, it was, actually.
Go through.
- Hello, Alistair.
- He's asking questions I don't understand.
All I said was, "Are we in business, or are we in business?"
That's a debatable point at the moment.
- What do you know that I don't know?
- I'm just thinking of something else.
- I assume you mean the filming?
- Do I mean the filming?
- Well, do you or don't you?
- Yes, Li.
Everything's going so... hey...
And the people, everyone's so... you know.
There were no adjectives in that sentence.
How about superb, wonderful, brilliant?
- How about telling the truth?
- Would I lie...
Li?
Listen, Mike Barbosa is so thrilled that he's invited you to your father's house tomorrow to see the filming.
Lionel doesn't have to be invited to his own father's house.
Particularly by an American television executive only just out of short trousers.
And in case the child has forgotten, Lionel's the author.
Can we cease fire, hmm?
I thought you'd be thrilled.
This is your chance to see your words coming off the page.
Assuming any of my words are left on the page.
You can be very cynical sometimes, Li.
Now, you will both come, won't you?
- I suppose I have to see it sometime.
- Not the most enthusiastic yes.
- It's the best I can do.
- I suppose it could be quite funny.
Funny?
Seeing somebody else pretending to be us.
Perhaps odd is a better word.
Yeah, that's a thought.
Who are pretending to be us?
Wait for this.
Jake Paris and Beverley Branch.
- Never heard of them.
- Can they act?
Can they act?
Can they act?
OK, they may not be household names yet but Beverley Branch is a budding actress.
Believe me, they are going to be big.
- What, Beverley Branch?
- Jake Paris?
Here's an idea.
Why not ask Judy and Sandy down as well?
- I expect they'd like that.
- Great!
So I'll pick you all up about ten, OK?
- Thanks, Alistair.
- I'll see myself out.
- This Jake Paris...
- Think of him as a young...
William Lundigan.
Ciao.
- Who the hell's William Lundigan?
- Goodness knows.
But he must've looked a bit like Jake Paris.
I wonder what Beverley Branch looks like.
I shouldn't.
None of it's going to look like us.
I doubt if it'll bear much resemblance to what I wrote at all.
I probably shan't end up going to Korea.
I shall probably trot off with Wellington to Waterloo.
- Prettier uniforms.
- And you won't be a nurse.
You'll probably end up as a camp follower.
- Hope I'm one of the better-class ones.
- You're taking this all very lightly.
So should you.
You told me you'd reached a stage where you didn't care.
I know, but I've been thinking.
If this epic turns out to be the shambles I think it's going to be, nobody's ever going to ask me to write anything again.
That wouldn't be the end of the world, would it?
- No, I suppose not.
- And if it did happen... you could always retire.
Hey, you guys, terrific to see you.
Really terrific.
Come and say hello to some of the crew.
A really great crew, I might add.
This is Nigel, Chris, Peter, Kevin,
Mandy and Pam, and over here we have
Ben, Shorty...
No, that's not Shorty.
That's Curly.
And there's Marianne.
- Did you get all that?
- Oh, yes.
And this... this is our director Moses Crispiani.
- Hello.
- Why do we do it?
You tell me.
Why do we do it?
- He's a cheerful soul, isn't he?
- Do we have a problem, Moses?
- We're waiting for the light.
- A religious conversion of some sort?
Moses, this is Lionel Hardcastle and his wife, Jean.
- Lionel is the writer.
- How do you do?
Right.
Great script.
Great script.
Why doesn't that cloud go away?
I would have thought with a name like Moses, he could have fixed that.
- It's moving now.
- That's because Alistair's arrived.
Al's right.
The cloud is moving.
OK, listen up, everybody.
The cloud is moving.
Stand by.
Come on, let's go.
Some time today, Nigel.
Shorty, take both chairs.
Excitable lot, aren't they?
OK, everybody, let's go for it.
- Quiet!
- Which bit are they doing?
When Lionel's saying goodbye to his father.
- The father comes through the door...
- Quiet!
Action!
Cut!
Cut!
Cut!
Why is he in hunting pink?
- Why the cut, Moses?
- Am I the only one with eyes around here?
There's something moving in the window behind him.
I think Madge must be at home.
Stay cool.
Stay cool.
I'll sort it out.
- I told you, we could have shot this in LA!
- OK, I'll sort it out.
Excuse me, ladies.
I thought that would stop them.
- You're being a damn nuisance.
- I sincerely hope so.
That's the spirit.
Give me a break.
Please.
You're costing us money.
I do not give a fig.
- Rocky?
- There's no budging her.
She's anti-hunting, and that's it.
- But there is no hunting scene.
- Sorry, I'm simply not having it.
Put him in some other clothes or I persist with my placard.
And I shall make one of my own.
I'll have a word with Moses.
What did you say, young man?
- What is it, Mrs Bale?
- Mr and Mrs Hardcastle Junior.
You don't have to announce them, you silly old trout.
- Hello, you young people.
- Hello, dears.
- Lovely to see you both.
- We thought it was you.
- I say, you've got Mike in a bit of a tizz.
- He can tizz away to his heart's content.
- I didn't write you in hunting pink.
- No, no, that was Solomon's idea.
- Moses.
- That's it...
- That's the fellow.
- He's not in too good a mood either.
He's a sullen cove at the best of times.
I have to say, I feel responsible for that crowd being here.
Oh, don't worry, it's rather fun, really.
I must say, Rocky's taken rather a shine to those little make-up girls.
What about you, my girl?
Giggling away all the time with that best man.
- Are you sure you mean best man?
- He means best boy.
I've seen that on film credits.
What does he actually do?
I don't know exactly but he's very personable.
I could've told them about the clouds when I listened to the shipping forecast.
Why didn't you, Mrs Bale?
Because I've heard that Moses person describe me as "domestic".
- Enough said.
- I hope these are suitably explosive.
They should be.
They're called Tahitian volcanoes.
I shall be serving a buffet luncheon at 1:23.
Unless any of us intend to sneak out to that charabanc.
- Did she say charabanc?
- Yes, it's a sort of bus, dear.
- Where all the film people eat.
- We have sneaked off there a few times.
- It's jolly good grub.
- OK, you win.
The hunting suit is out.
More important, the sun is out.
Come on, Jean, Lionel, let's go see a movie.
- I've just got comfortable.
- Oh, come on.
Oh, all right.
Oh, Mike.
I've been meaning to ask, what exactly is your role in all this?
Co-executive deputy supervising associate producer.
Well, you did ask.
So come on, straight.
Are you really finished with Alistair or not?
No comment.
It's not the press you're talking to, it's me.
I don't know, Sandy.
I do like him but it was like going out with a jumping cracker.
He's all over the place.
Yes, but, you know, when you're around, he doesn't have eyes for anybody else at all.
- Are you sure?
- Honestly.
- Well, perhaps if we...
- What?
Oh...
He wants to play doctors and nurses.
Hey, you two!
Come and say hi to Beverley Branch.
She's playing your mother, Judy.
OK, let's have quiet everywhere.
Hey, I said everywhere.
Action!
Move it, son.
England expects, and all that rot.
- What?
- Coming, Dad.
Oh, there we are.
Where did they come from?
Cut!
Cut!
What the hell are you people doing?
- A stroll before lunch.
- You're in the shot.
- Is there anything you'd like us to do?
- Yes.
Get the hell out of my shot.
Your manners, young man, leave a great deal to be desired.
- I feel almost sorry for Moses.
- I don't.
- "And all that rot, what?"
- Tiny change, Li.
OK, we're going again.
Quiet!
- Action!
- Move it, son.
England expects, and all that rot.
What?
Did you say goodbye to Mama?
Sure.
And the staff.
Poor old Nanny Lightfoot's blubbing in the nursery.
Ah, jeez, that's sad.
Well, what time is your train to London station?
- A quarter of 12.
- You best be hopping it, then.
It's a shame Jean couldn't stop by to say cheer-ho.
I guess a nurse's job...
Just a blooming tick!
- Who's that?
- It's Jean.
Lionel!
- Jean!
- Lionel!
- Jean...
- Lionel...
Cut!
That's right.
Terrific, I smell Emmy.
Doesn't it just tear at the heart strings?
I never wore a skirt like that.
It looks like something out of a Carry On film.
I looked like something out of a comic opera.
How are you supposed to have got down to Hampshire?
There wasn't even a car.
I ran all the way from the Middlesex Hospital.
London station.
I mean, London station?
Minor alterations to the script, they said.
The only word I remember writing in that scene is "Dad".
There's no chance that it could be a joke?
- Every chance.
- No, a joke as in prank.
Does Moses strike you as the sort of man who plays pranks?
- I'm just whistling in the wind.
- Hi, everybody.
You didn't like it, did you?
Well, any of it?
Yes, I liked the bit where Madge and Rocky and Mrs Bale walked through the shot.
- "You're in shot!" - "Is there anything you'd like us to do?"
"Yes, get the hell out of shot."
"Your manners leave a lot to be desired, young man."
And all that going on with poor old Nanny Lightfoot, who never even existed, blubbing her eyes out in the nursery!
- Hey!
You've lightened up.
- Yeah...
Well, we have to treat it as a joke or I'll go out and shoot myself.
I didn't know it had got so far away from the original.
Really, I didn't.
The script I've got is only the fourth revision.
What revision are they working from now?
The 12th, actually.
I assume that you had a hand in casting Beverley Branch?
I had nothing to do with that.
Really, I didn't.
- If you have to look like someone on film...
- Oh, true.
I can claim she looked the spitting image of me as a girl.
Hey, what are all you guys doing in here?
- Hiding, originally.
- Then we decided to have a laugh.
Oh, great.
What about?
That travesty we've just watched out there.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I had no idea those people were gonna cross shot.
Not them!
The scene.
- Travesty?
- Farce.
- Mess.
- Twaddle.
Alistair?
I have to say this, Mike.
I really, really hope you know what you're doing.
- Trust me.
- That's what I kept telling Lionel.
- The only problem is that you're British.
- We don't find that a problem.
Let me finish.
You have to remember that this show is aimed at a US market.
- Say you were a potato farmer from Idaho.
- That's a stretch of the imagination.
But say you were.
You'd have to have a picture of England you could relate to.
- Peculiar people in Idaho.
- OK, Mary Poppins.
She doesn't fly in at the end of the film, does she?
Lionel, please.
Do you remember Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent in Mary Poppins?
- I'd sooner not, really.
- That's because you're British.
To that potato farmer in Idaho, that was cockney.
- You know, that makes a lot of sense.
- Let's just hang on to that thought.
What I...
Excuse me.
Sorry, I have to go.
Those people just crossed shot again.
Are you sure you're not coming out again?
They're doing the scene where you come home from Korea.
Yes, there was talk of you losing an arm.
Really?
- You didn't bat an eyelid then.
- I don't think I have an eyelid left to bat.
Well, Sandy and I are going.
After all, it's not dull, is it?
We'll let you know about the arm.
- Ready, Madge?
- Oh, absolutely.
I know there was something I wanted to tell you.
It's about you getting the house.
- You've changed your minds?
- Stuff and nonsense, of course not.
Madge and I will be leaving in two weeks' time.
- Oh, I see.
- You can always change your minds.
Oh, no, we can't wait to go!
You won't mind if we take the pin table, will you?
I don't think I'd use it a lot.
You said you were going to Lithuania.
No, we're putting that on hold for a bit.
We've actually found a travel agency that does tours to Mongolia.
- We thought we might give that a crack.
- Mongolia?
- Inner or Outer?
- Oh, both, hopefully.
Rock on.
Remember what I said, my boy, don't feel you're obliged to move in.
Just use it as a retreat, if you like.
I mean, it's all very nice down here but it can get a bit on the dull side.
- See you later.
- You won't walk through the shot again?
Only if the mood takes us.
- I wonder if I do lose an arm.
- You probably lose your whole body.
All that comes back from Korea is your head.
- You'd carry me about in a cardboard box.
- Be careful not to leave you anywhere.
Do you think the Korean scenes are going to be filmed in Korea?
I heard Wales mentioned.
Well, I hope that potato farmer in Idaho likes it.
He's becoming crucially important, that man.
- I'd thought you'd like some coffee.
- You're a treasure, Mrs Bale.
One does one's best.
But if I am to stay on as housekeeper, there is something I think you ought to know.
- What's that?
- I am over 40.
- Good gracious.
- I mean, if you'd prefer someone younger.
Don't be silly, of course we wouldn't, would we?
No!
Anyway, we shall probably only be down here at weekends.
- I just thought it should be said.
- Well, we appreciate it.
We'll probably only be down here at weekends?
- I've been thinking.
- You don't want to retire, do you?
No.
I mean, it's lovely down here, but what would we do with ourselves?
I don't know.
Just take it easy, I suppose.
- Sit in our rocking chairs?
- I didn't mention rocking chairs.
What, then?
Well... we could stroll down to the village sometimes.
Yes.
Then we could stroll back.
Obviously.
Sometimes, when we've strolled down to the village, we could stroll round the village before we stroll back.
All right, you've made your point.
No, but really, it's important.
Why?
Because I love you.
If you think you're going to get round me that way, you are.
But it's just as well, isn't it?
- I suppose it is.
- You see...
I think that loving someone is being your best for them.
I know I get fed up with the office sometimes and I know I get ratty when I come home sometimes but I never get bored.
I think if I got bored, then I'd get boring.
- What about you?
- Oh, not much of a problem.
I'm boring all the time.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not an Alistair sort of person, am I?
I couldn't deal with an Alistair.
I'd crack up.
No, I meant by "What about you?", what do you think?
I think you're right.
I think I'll just enjoy as much as I can of you in London and all of you down here at the weekends.
Oh, I like that bit.
- What about the girls?
- I don't want them here every weekend.
I mean, what about them living with us in London?
Well, I've almost got used to it.
But don't tell them.
They'll think I've gone soft.
No, well, we wouldn't want that.
Where are you going?
Well, against my better judgement,
I do want to know if I come back from Korea with two arms.
- Do you?
- I don't know.
They're just milling about.
It's all they seem to do most of the time.
Oh, I'm sorry they've ruined your story, Lionel.
It's our story.
And nobody can ruin it.
Of course, the first bit, when we were young, and this bit, when we were... well, slightly older...
they're rather good, really, aren't they?
No, they're very good.
Oh, look, somebody's waving at us.
Oh, it's Moses.
Hello.
I don't think it's that sort of wave.
- Can we be of any assistance?
- You're in shot!
You're in the shot!
Well, hard luck!
Oh, let's leave them to it.
I know somewhere we won't be in shot.
# You must remember this
# A kiss is still a kiss
# A sigh is just a sigh
# The fundamental things apply
# As time goes by
# And when two lovers woo
# They still say I love you
# On that you can rely
# The world will always welcome lovers
# As time goes by #
# You must remember this
# A kiss is still a kiss
# A sigh is just a sigh
# The fundamental things apply
# As time goes by #
Do you know something?
I feel redundant.
- Feel what?
- Redundant.
- I'm only reading the paper.
- No, not here, I mean at the office.
I feel it more and more.
I think of something to do only to find Judy or Sandy have already done it.
That's good.
They're showing initiative.
I wish they wouldn't show so much.
You don't think they're trying to tell me something?
I don't think they're plotting to overthrow you.
You don't think they're trying to tell me I'm yesterday's woman?
- Isn't that rather excessive?
- I don't know.
- Perhaps I am.
- I think of you as my child bride.
- Oh, do you?
- Well, not really, of course.
But I certainly don't think of you as yesterday's woman.
- It's you coming back into my life.
- Are you saying I've aged you?
I'm saying that before, you see...
I'm not saying that work was everything I had in my life.
- No, of course not.
- But it was everything I had in my life.
Now...
Why don't you retire?
- Retire?
- It's not a dirty word.
To do what, take up crochet or sequence dancing?
You're being excessive again.
For a start, we could spend more time together.
Have you retired, then?
- I'm not sure, really.
- What if your miniseries is a success?
- Fat chance.
- Never mind fat chance.
What if it is and they ask you to write something else?
- The money's good.
- Exactly.
You could be away working and I'd be stuck back here doing my crochet.
Crochet is your invention, and why am I suddenly away working?
- I work at home.
- You don't like being interrupted at work.
No, but I'd still be here, wouldn't I?
This sofa would be here.
I don't look on it as great company.
I probably won't ever be asked to write anything again.
- That's a probably.
- Life's made up of probablys.
That's one of those words.
Say it a few times and it ceases to be a real word.
- Probably, probably, probably.
- You've gone right off the track.
I'm not sure there ever was a track.
All I said was that I felt a bit redundant at the office.
Which is where we came in.
Don't get me wrong, I like being married.
I'm very pleased to hear it.
But I'm not a little-wifey sort of person.
I'm not really sure that I'm a little-hubby sort of person.
Meaning you'd like to go on working.
- If a miracle turns up, yes.
- But you'd like me to retire.
It was only a suggestion.
- You started this.
I was reading the paper.
- What were you reading?
- An article about crochet, actually.
- Oh!
Don't!
Hello, love.
How was the film?
Oh, it was sad, you know, a bit of a weepie.
- Did you enjoy the film, Sandy?
- Oh, very much.
Funniest thing I've seen in ages.
- You did see the same film?
- I just said it was a bit of a weepie.
- Clang!
- I don't have to know where you were.
All right.
We didn't go and see a film.
It's just we get so sick and tired of going to see flats and coming back and saying how awful they were.
So you saw a flat.
And?
It was awful.
Garden flat, it said.
You should've seen the garden.
Six square feet of concrete with a shrub in a tub.
- A dead shrub.
- It was like a tiny prison exercise yard.
- Hello, you two.
How was the film?
- They've been to see a flat.
- My memory must be going.
- No, we fibbed.
- I see.
- Aren't you going to ask us why?
No, I don't think I will.
- So, what was the flat like?
- Ideally suited... to manic depressives.
- Well, I think you should give up looking.
- Yes, that's what I said.
Lionel has got used to living with a monstrous regiment of women.
I'll ignore that.
The fact is that we may not be here much longer.
You're not talking about dying?
I'm talking about Rocky and Madge's house.
Well, my house soon.
Jean and I might be moving down there.
- Permanently?
- I don't see why not.
- Your mother's thinking of retiring.
- Retiring?
- Are you really?
- Don't let your supper get cold.
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.
I'd like one of those planes that tows a big banner behind it.
- I'm not supposed to understand that, am I?
- Big red letters. "Jean is retiring."
Perhaps you'd like to announce it on Radio 2.
Two people I mentioned it to.
Two people.
I didn't say retiring.
I said "is thinking of retiring".
- Who says I am?
- You did.
No, I did not.
All I said was I felt a bit redundant at the office.
Suddenly, I find you issuing official statements.
Where are you going?
To retract the official statement which I never made.
Look, we don't want Jean to agonise about which one of us gets her job.
We could run the office between us.
Yeah, of course we could.
Which one of us gets her desk?
Forget everything I said.
Jean has absolutely no intention of retiring.
Oh.
But I am thinking about it.
- We're off to the shops.
- Oh, right.
You won't forget...
- Lionel's custards tarts?
No.
- They're top of the list.
Right, bye, then.
Well?
- Look, Mum, we don't want you to retire.
- No, of course we don't.
We don't want you to feel any pressure from either of us.
Just because we're young, vibrant, ambitious.
- We'd miss you.
- Professionally?
- Of course we would.
- A lot.
- That came out very quickly, didn't it?
- All right.
If you want an honest answer, I suppose we could get by without you.
- Oh!
- That doesn't mean to say we want to.
It wouldn't be the same.
Less bullying.
- But it wouldn't be the same.
- Oh, go shopping!
- (Doorbell) - (Lionel) I'll go.
Truly, Mum.
We really don't want you to retire.
I know.
But Lionel does.
Oh, go on.
Hi, Li.
Are we in business, or are we in business?
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Hello, Alistair.
- Hey, hey.
- We're going shopping.
Something soft and sexy, I hope.
Depends on how you feel about custard tarts.
Bye.
Bye.
- Now, was that called for?
- Yes, it was, actually.
Go through.
- Hello, Alistair.
- He's asking questions I don't understand.
All I said was, "Are we in business, or are we in business?"
That's a debatable point at the moment.
- What do you know that I don't know?
- I'm just thinking of something else.
- I assume you mean the filming?
- Do I mean the filming?
- Well, do you or don't you?
- Yes, Li.
Everything's going so... hey...
And the people, everyone's so... you know.
There were no adjectives in that sentence.
How about superb, wonderful, brilliant?
- How about telling the truth?
- Would I lie...
Li?
Listen, Mike Barbosa is so thrilled that he's invited you to your father's house tomorrow to see the filming.
Lionel doesn't have to be invited to his own father's house.
Particularly by an American television executive only just out of short trousers.
And in case the child has forgotten, Lionel's the author.
Can we cease fire, hmm?
I thought you'd be thrilled.
This is your chance to see your words coming off the page.
Assuming any of my words are left on the page.
You can be very cynical sometimes, Li.
Now, you will both come, won't you?
- I suppose I have to see it sometime.
- Not the most enthusiastic yes.
- It's the best I can do.
- I suppose it could be quite funny.
Funny?
Seeing somebody else pretending to be us.
Perhaps odd is a better word.
Yeah, that's a thought.
Who are pretending to be us?
Wait for this.
Jake Paris and Beverley Branch.
- Never heard of them.
- Can they act?
Can they act?
Can they act?
OK, they may not be household names yet but Beverley Branch is a budding actress.
Believe me, they are going to be big.
- What, Beverley Branch?
- Jake Paris?
Here's an idea.
Why not ask Judy and Sandy down as well?
- I expect they'd like that.
- Great!
So I'll pick you all up about ten, OK?
- Thanks, Alistair.
- I'll see myself out.
- This Jake Paris...
- Think of him as a young...
William Lundigan.
Ciao.
- Who the hell's William Lundigan?
- Goodness knows.
But he must've looked a bit like Jake Paris.
I wonder what Beverley Branch looks like.
I shouldn't.
None of it's going to look like us.
I doubt if it'll bear much resemblance to what I wrote at all.
I probably shan't end up going to Korea.
I shall probably trot off with Wellington to Waterloo.
- Prettier uniforms.
- And you won't be a nurse.
You'll probably end up as a camp follower.
- Hope I'm one of the better-class ones.
- You're taking this all very lightly.
So should you.
You told me you'd reached a stage where you didn't care.
I know, but I've been thinking.
If this epic turns out to be the shambles I think it's going to be, nobody's ever going to ask me to write anything again.
That wouldn't be the end of the world, would it?
- No, I suppose not.
- And if it did happen... you could always retire.
Hey, you guys, terrific to see you.
Really terrific.
Come and say hello to some of the crew.
A really great crew, I might add.
This is Nigel, Chris, Peter, Kevin,
Mandy and Pam, and over here we have
Ben, Shorty...
No, that's not Shorty.
That's Curly.
And there's Marianne.
- Did you get all that?
- Oh, yes.
And this... this is our director Moses Crispiani.
- Hello.
- Why do we do it?
You tell me.
Why do we do it?
- He's a cheerful soul, isn't he?
- Do we have a problem, Moses?
- We're waiting for the light.
- A religious conversion of some sort?
Moses, this is Lionel Hardcastle and his wife, Jean.
- Lionel is the writer.
- How do you do?
Right.
Great script.
Great script.
Why doesn't that cloud go away?
I would have thought with a name like Moses, he could have fixed that.
- It's moving now.
- That's because Alistair's arrived.
Al's right.
The cloud is moving.
OK, listen up, everybody.
The cloud is moving.
Stand by.
Come on, let's go.
Some time today, Nigel.
Shorty, take both chairs.
Excitable lot, aren't they?
OK, everybody, let's go for it.
- Quiet!
- Which bit are they doing?
When Lionel's saying goodbye to his father.
- The father comes through the door...
- Quiet!
Action!
Cut!
Cut!
Cut!
Why is he in hunting pink?
- Why the cut, Moses?
- Am I the only one with eyes around here?
There's something moving in the window behind him.
I think Madge must be at home.
Stay cool.
Stay cool.
I'll sort it out.
- I told you, we could have shot this in LA!
- OK, I'll sort it out.
Excuse me, ladies.
I thought that would stop them.
- You're being a damn nuisance.
- I sincerely hope so.
That's the spirit.
Give me a break.
Please.
You're costing us money.
I do not give a fig.
- Rocky?
- There's no budging her.
She's anti-hunting, and that's it.
- But there is no hunting scene.
- Sorry, I'm simply not having it.
Put him in some other clothes or I persist with my placard.
And I shall make one of my own.
I'll have a word with Moses.
What did you say, young man?
- What is it, Mrs Bale?
- Mr and Mrs Hardcastle Junior.
You don't have to announce them, you silly old trout.
- Hello, you young people.
- Hello, dears.
- Lovely to see you both.
- We thought it was you.
- I say, you've got Mike in a bit of a tizz.
- He can tizz away to his heart's content.
- I didn't write you in hunting pink.
- No, no, that was Solomon's idea.
- Moses.
- That's it...
- That's the fellow.
- He's not in too good a mood either.
He's a sullen cove at the best of times.
I have to say, I feel responsible for that crowd being here.
Oh, don't worry, it's rather fun, really.
I must say, Rocky's taken rather a shine to those little make-up girls.
What about you, my girl?
Giggling away all the time with that best man.
- Are you sure you mean best man?
- He means best boy.
I've seen that on film credits.
What does he actually do?
I don't know exactly but he's very personable.
I could've told them about the clouds when I listened to the shipping forecast.
Why didn't you, Mrs Bale?
Because I've heard that Moses person describe me as "domestic".
- Enough said.
- I hope these are suitably explosive.
They should be.
They're called Tahitian volcanoes.
I shall be serving a buffet luncheon at 1:23.
Unless any of us intend to sneak out to that charabanc.
- Did she say charabanc?
- Yes, it's a sort of bus, dear.
- Where all the film people eat.
- We have sneaked off there a few times.
- It's jolly good grub.
- OK, you win.
The hunting suit is out.
More important, the sun is out.
Come on, Jean, Lionel, let's go see a movie.
- I've just got comfortable.
- Oh, come on.
Oh, all right.
Oh, Mike.
I've been meaning to ask, what exactly is your role in all this?
Co-executive deputy supervising associate producer.
Well, you did ask.
So come on, straight.
Are you really finished with Alistair or not?
No comment.
It's not the press you're talking to, it's me.
I don't know, Sandy.
I do like him but it was like going out with a jumping cracker.
He's all over the place.
Yes, but, you know, when you're around, he doesn't have eyes for anybody else at all.
- Are you sure?
- Honestly.
- Well, perhaps if we...
- What?
Oh...
He wants to play doctors and nurses.
Hey, you two!
Come and say hi to Beverley Branch.
She's playing your mother, Judy.
OK, let's have quiet everywhere.
Hey, I said everywhere.
Action!
Move it, son.
England expects, and all that rot.
- What?
- Coming, Dad.
(Rocky) Oh, there we are.
Where did they come from?
Cut!
Cut!
What the hell are you people doing?
- A stroll before lunch.
- You're in the shot.
- Is there anything you'd like us to do?
- Yes.
Get the hell out of my shot.
Your manners, young man, leave a great deal to be desired.
- I feel almost sorry for Moses.
- I don't.
- "And all that rot, what?"
- Tiny change, Li.
OK, we're going again.
Quiet!
- Action!
- Move it, son.
England expects, and all that rot.
What?
Did you say goodbye to Mama?
Sure.
And the staff.
Poor old Nanny Lightfoot's blubbing in the nursery.
Ah, jeez, that's sad.
Well, what time is your train to London station?
- A quarter of 12.
- You best be hopping it, then.
It's a shame Jean couldn't stop by to say cheer-ho.
I guess a nurse's job...
Just a blooming tick!
- Who's that?
- It's Jean.
Lionel!
- Jean!
- Lionel!
- Jean...
- Lionel...
Cut!
That's right.
Terrific, I smell Emmy.
Doesn't it just tear at the heart strings?
I never wore a skirt like that.
It looks like something out of a Carry On film.
I looked like something out of a comic opera.
How are you supposed to have got down to Hampshire?
There wasn't even a car.
I ran all the way from the Middlesex Hospital.
London station.
I mean, London station?
Minor alterations to the script, they said.
The only word I remember writing in that scene is "Dad".
There's no chance that it could be a joke?
- Every chance.
- No, a joke as in prank.
Does Moses strike you as the sort of man who plays pranks?
- I'm just whistling in the wind.
- Hi, everybody.
You didn't like it, did you?
Well, any of it?
Yes, I liked the bit where Madge and Rocky and Mrs Bale walked through the shot.
- "You're in shot!" - "Is there anything you'd like us to do?"
"Yes, get the hell out of shot."
"Your manners leave a lot to be desired, young man."
And all that going on with poor old Nanny Lightfoot, who never even existed, blubbing her eyes out in the nursery!
- Hey!
You've lightened up.
- Yeah...
Well, we have to treat it as a joke or I'll go out and shoot myself.
I didn't know it had got so far away from the original.
Really, I didn't.
The script I've got is only the fourth revision.
What revision are they working from now?
The 12th, actually.
I assume that you had a hand in casting Beverley Branch?
I had nothing to do with that.
Really, I didn't.
- If you have to look like someone on film...
- Oh, true.
I can claim she looked the spitting image of me as a girl.
Hey, what are all you guys doing in here?
- Hiding, originally.
- Then we decided to have a laugh.
Oh, great.
What about?
That travesty we've just watched out there.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I had no idea those people were gonna cross shot.
Not them!
The scene.
- Travesty?
- Farce.
- Mess.
- Twaddle.
Alistair?
I have to say this, Mike.
I really, really hope you know what you're doing.
- Trust me.
- That's what I kept telling Lionel.
- The only problem is that you're British.
- We don't find that a problem.
Let me finish.
You have to remember that this show is aimed at a US market.
- Say you were a potato farmer from Idaho.
- That's a stretch of the imagination.
But say you were.
You'd have to have a picture of England you could relate to.
- Peculiar people in Idaho.
- OK, Mary Poppins.
She doesn't fly in at the end of the film, does she?
Lionel, please.
Do you remember Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent in Mary Poppins?
- I'd sooner not, really.
- That's because you're British.
To that potato farmer in Idaho, that was cockney.
- You know, that makes a lot of sense.
- Let's just hang on to that thought.
What I...
Excuse me.
Sorry, I have to go.
Those people just crossed shot again.
Are you sure you're not coming out again?
They're doing the scene where you come home from Korea.
Yes, there was talk of you losing an arm.
Really?
- You didn't bat an eyelid then.
- I don't think I have an eyelid left to bat.
Well, Sandy and I are going.
After all, it's not dull, is it?
We'll let you know about the arm.
- Ready, Madge?
- Oh, absolutely.
I know there was something I wanted to tell you.
It's about you getting the house.
- You've changed your minds?
- Stuff and nonsense, of course not.
Madge and I will be leaving in two weeks' time.
- Oh, I see.
- You can always change your minds.
Oh, no, we can't wait to go!
You won't mind if we take the pin table, will you?
I don't think I'd use it a lot.
You said you were going to Lithuania.
No, we're putting that on hold for a bit.
We've actually found a travel agency that does tours to Mongolia.
- We thought we might give that a crack.
- Mongolia?
- Inner or Outer?
- Oh, both, hopefully.
Rock on.
Remember what I said, my boy, don't feel you're obliged to move in.
Just use it as a retreat, if you like.
I mean, it's all very nice down here but it can get a bit on the dull side.
- See you later.
- You won't walk through the shot again?
Only if the mood takes us.
- I wonder if I do lose an arm.
- You probably lose your whole body.
All that comes back from Korea is your head.
- You'd carry me about in a cardboard box.
- Be careful not to leave you anywhere.
Do you think the Korean scenes are going to be filmed in Korea?
I heard Wales mentioned.
Well, I hope that potato farmer in Idaho likes it.
He's becoming crucially important, that man.
- I'd thought you'd like some coffee.
- You're a treasure, Mrs Bale.
One does one's best.
But if I am to stay on as housekeeper, there is something I think you ought to know.
- What's that?
- I am over 40.
- Good gracious.
- I mean, if you'd prefer someone younger.
Don't be silly, of course we wouldn't, would we?
No!
Anyway, we shall probably only be down here at weekends.
- I just thought it should be said.
- Well, we appreciate it.
We'll probably only be down here at weekends?
- I've been thinking.
- You don't want to retire, do you?
No.
I mean, it's lovely down here, but what would we do with ourselves?
I don't know.
Just take it easy, I suppose.
- Sit in our rocking chairs?
- I didn't mention rocking chairs.
What, then?
Well... we could stroll down to the village sometimes.
Yes.
Then we could stroll back.
Obviously.
Sometimes, when we've strolled down to the village, we could stroll round the village before we stroll back.
All right, you've made your point.
No, but really, it's important.
Why?
Because I love you.
If you think you're going to get round me that way, you are.
But it's just as well, isn't it?
- I suppose it is.
- You see...
I think that loving someone is being your best for them.
I know I get fed up with the office sometimes and I know I get ratty when I come home sometimes but I never get bored.
I think if I got bored, then I'd get boring.
- What about you?
- Oh, not much of a problem.
I'm boring all the time.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not an Alistair sort of person, am I?
I couldn't deal with an Alistair.
I'd crack up.
No, I meant by "What about you?", what do you think?
I think you're right.
I think I'll just enjoy as much as I can of you in London and all of you down here at the weekends.
Oh, I like that bit.
- What about the girls?
- I don't want them here every weekend.
I mean, what about them living with us in London?
Well, I've almost got used to it.
But don't tell them.
They'll think I've gone soft.
No, well, we wouldn't want that.
Where are you going?
Well, against my better judgement,
I do want to know if I come back from Korea with two arms.
- Do you?
- I don't know.
They're just milling about.
It's all they seem to do most of the time.
Oh, I'm sorry they've ruined your story, Lionel.
It's our story.
And nobody can ruin it.
Of course, the first bit, when we were young, and this bit, when we were... well, slightly older...
they're rather good, really, aren't they?
No, they're very good.
Oh, look, somebody's waving at us.
Oh, it's Moses.
Hello.
I don't think it's that sort of wave.
- Can we be of any assistance?
- You're in shot!
You're in the shot!
Well, hard luck!
Oh, let's leave them to it.
I know somewhere we won't be in shot.
# You must remember this

"A TRICK OF THE LIGHT"
In 1894, I was still little, only five.
A lot of things were already happening in Berlin.
There were no automobiles yet.
And cinema hadn't been invented yet.
But it was in the air, my daddy said.
His name was Max Skladanowsky.
Back then, we had to earn our money on the fairgrounds.
with so called "nebula pictures."
This is Uncle Eugen.
He tells stories about that.
I found the show to be rather boring... but the audience was trilled.
No wonder, since they were all children.
Behind the curtain, Uncle Emil was whirling around... all by himself.
I thought it didn't look real, because it just didn't move right.
The nicest part was at the end, when Uncle Eugen started to juggle.
All the tricks he could to do!
I loved my Uncle Eugen like no one else!
we lived in Pankow, near Berlin.
Our apartment actually was more of a shop.
After work, I was allowed to watch the zoetrope with my friends.
At night we usually stayed up late.
I played with my uncles, so dad could work undisturbed.
He was working on his invention.
It was supposed to become a "bioscope."
Others were interested in creating such a presentation machine.
But no one was to steal our idea.
That's why my dad hid behind the curtain.
In the fall, something else was going on.
I could smell it.
They tried to confess something to me.
we were going into financial ruin.
For weeks, we were eating potatoes.
But on this night, my uncle and my dad didn't want to eat at all.
They brought it to me gently.
Uncle Eugen had to go on tour the next day.
He had an engagement at the circus.
I was against it and presented mostly factual arguments.
That evening, the mail man brought the long-awaited package:
"roll film" for dad's invention.
This film was supposed to put dancing Uncle Eugen into our camera.
And dad's bioscope would then bring him back to life.
This sounded too good to be true.
It was on my mind for several nights.
Now, uncle Eugen was supposed to go on film.
we had to go on the roof, because dad said... that we needed a lot of light for our photographic pictures.
Man, were we excited!
Oh!
That was scary!
Thank God Uncle Emil saved the exposure.
It wasn't enough for me.
I wanted to put the clouds into that box.
The second roll film was exclusively for Uncle Eugen.
And then he had to go.
I begged him to stay.
But dad insisted in all seriousness that there were now two uncles... and one of them was hiding in the camera.
A doppelganger of Uncle Eugen in the camera?
That was a bit scary to me.
I had to check right away.
what a letdown!
But I took the fraud rather calmly.
Only dad and Uncle Emil said in all earnest... that I had chased away the second Eugen.
But thankfully we had captured him twice.
when they finally showed him to me... he was as small as the "Dancing Lilly" in the zoetrope!
And he did the same thing over and over.
No, I wasn't going to be brushed off with something like that.
Dad knew that I wouldn't let go.
I wanted to see my Uncle Eugen.
He promised, and I had to insist.
Then they came up with another invention:
the flip-book!
what a joke!
As if they didn't know what size my Uncle Eugen was!
That's the way he moved!
I had to have a serious word with them.
Since I kept insisting... dad all of a sudden understood how this thing had to be built.
we worked like slaves... until the sweat was on our brow.
I kept us up to speed.
The bioscope had to be ready... before someone else came up with the idea, or stole ours!
Spy!
Finally the time came!
we solved the discontinuous film transport problem... with a double projector system.
But to explain this would go too far now.
That's only for experts.
That was the way I had pictured it.
Suddenly everything on the wall was like it really was on the roof.
The three of us were quite excited!
Uncle Emil didn't stop talking about the birth of the cinema... and called the bioscope the invention of the century.
well, now you know who really was the driving force behind all this.
Me!
HERE LIVED AND WORKED MAX SKLADANOWSKY
INVENTOR OF THE BIOSCOPE CO-FOUNDER OF CINEMATOGRAPHY
These are the original photos... and only ones preserved.
Here, this is a picture of dad in 1 895.
Should I say his full name?
-Yes.
-Yes.
This is my father, Max Skladanowsky... born on April 30, 1863.
This picture was taken in 1 895... at the time of the Wintergarten presentation.
These are the three Skladanowsky Brothers.
My father on the left, Uncle Emil in the middle... and Uncle Eugen, the older brother, on the right.
These so-called Hohenzollern coats were very elegant... they had a fur lining.
And for fun... they let themselves be photographed from behind.
we all grew up together here in this house.
Dad bought it in 1907... and I still live in the same house.
This picture was taken by my father's friend, Willi Fenz.
It shows my oldest sister Gertrud, my brother Erich... and the one standing in the front, that's me when I was four years old.
I was very proud of my white dress with red pattern... white-red checkered socks and red shoes.
It was very modern at the time.
I was the only one of the siblings that was blonde.
Did you get that, Jürgen?
Yes, and this is my oldest sister Gertrud.
It was sold as "Doll Cook."
Here.
These weren't sold like this.
They came in small cardboard cases... and on the outside it would say what it was.
"The Doll Cook" or "The Skat Game"...
"The Kaffeeklatsch", "The Lovers", and things like that.
These books were manufactured and sold by the thousands.
They made dad a lot of money, more than the film.
The clock strikes.
It was actually the film... which he cut into pieces and patched together.
It was for a "Liebig-Extract" commercial.
Something you put in your soup to spice it up.
They later made stock cubes.
And now they say my sister was the first child star in the world.
That's right.
Grandpa often had these nebula picture shows... and they were such success... that one day a teacher said that he should show them in schools.
Then the demand grew... and he rented big halls and showed them in those halls.
These nebula pictures, the first ones were so bad... and then dad learned glass painting and painted the pictures himself.
This was elaborate, since they were enlarged from a small format... to up to 6.5 feet, so every brush stroke had to be perfect... otherwise you would have seen every mistake in the close-up.
There was the "wonderland of Pyramids"...
"Air Conquest", "Journey to the North Pole"... and other different, individual things... moving things that dad came up with.
"Fire in the chalet":
first you had the chalet... then, with a second device, clouds on glass were pushed over it... and then it started to rain.
Then other things were added and taken off with other glass.
It burned, lightning would strike.
All of these things were painted on these glass slides... which were inserted... so lightning flashed, and the chalet started to burn.
The last image was the moonshine hanging above the clouds.
The moon and the burned out chalet.
It was almost like a film, but it was all painted.
And then in '92 he had the idea... to create a film with real life photography.
Mrs. Skladanowsky... your dad had a camera, but no projector, right?
It didn't exist yet.
He had to invent it.
The first takes... where Uncle Emil is on the roof of the Schönhauer Alice... were already made in '92.
-with the same camera?
-Yes, with the same camera.
And he had to create a projecting device, the bioscope.
There was a technical problem...
Dad had two films... and the picture was constantly moved over to one side... and that's how the movement was created.
This was the so-called intermitted mechanism.
That's what it said on the patent.
And one picture was always dark and the other light?
Gertrud was born 13 years before you... and lived with your father and the two uncles, right?
well, she was only a child then.
He used to say that there had been no films then... and that he had ordered celluloid plates from a British company... which he cut into pieces, and then glued them together to make film... that's what he told me.
Glued together or using shoe grommets, I heard.
Yes, because during the show the film was constantly breaking.
This projector was run by hand and sometimes it wasn't on firm ground.
So without grommets, the film would constantly tear.
The movies for the Wintergarten program were shot before.
In...
Pankow.
In the former "Feldschlösschen."
This was a garden restaurant people liked to visit.
It had a big dance hall... and he could show the things he shot right there.
It was very laborious... because there was no electricity yet, no lights.
It had to be shot when there was good light... so June and July were the perfect time.
-Outside?
-Yes, everything outside.
And all the artists did it for free... because it was free advertising for them.
The most intricate was the boxing kangaroo.
-Dad!
-Was it, little one?
Dad, people from the movies are here!
-Yes, and?
-Don't you want to tell it yourself?
Gertrud, this is long in the past!
Who would possibly want to know about this?
They came because of us!
It's great advertising.
You think so?
Well, if you really want me to.
Well, all right.
This is how it was.
1895 was the year... when the first moving images were presented.
All over the world inventors were working on this.
Cinema was in the air... whether it was in our Berlin air or the Parisian air.
In December 1 895... we were in the Grand Café on the Boulevard des Capucines... and watched what the French had to offer.
The Lumière Brothers... with their so-called "Cinematograph"...
"Graphomates," or something like that.
what the Cinematograph had to offer was great.
Our "Bioscope" couldn't compete with that.
Our dream burst like a bubble.
But for you to really empathize...
I have to tell you the whole story, step by step.
In late summer we scraped together our last six... so we could do the presentation.
It took place in the garden of the Feldschlösschen restaurant.
My brothers helped me in various functions.
But when I asked Emil to dress up as a boxing kangaroo...
I was crossing the line.
The best artists that were visiting the city at the time, however... didn't think twice about presenting their talent to us.
Brother Emil was always popular with the ladies.
But now, being in front of the camera, he was even more popular.
And with Josephine, to our dismay... he was struck... completely.
Now we were ready to present... our program to the public.
But before we could present... our invention to the proper establishments, we had visitors.
Dorn and Baron.
The highly regarded directors of the renowned Wintergarten Vaudeville.
Because they heard rumors about our "moving images."
They wanted to see with their own eyes what this was about.
All the way to Pankow they came... when all the artists would stand in line outside their talent agencies.
They had the biggest curiosities and tricks in the program.
"Bears on the High wire", "King of the Man Eaters"... even singing sea lions were under contract!
"Moving images"!
They had never seen anything like that.
They were very excited, because they didn't know this.
Pictures moving on their own... without anything else being there, other than... light.
They hired us on the spot.
Emil and Eugen had never seen so much money in their life before.
Even in the worst dumps... hobbyists were trying to get pictures to fidget.
But their projectors were downright hazardous.
Our worries went up in smoke!
All of Berlin had to know about the world premiere of our bioscope.
Eugen and Gertrud posted thousands of bills themselves... and repeatedly saw the announcements... for the famed "Serpentine Dance" of Madame Fulla.
She was the biggest sensation at the time in Paris and London.
"The Serpentine Dance" was exactly the act that was missing for us.
The results of the shots were exquisite.
Those were unforgettable days for me... when all of us put together the Wintergarten program.
Eugen composed the accompanying music.
Emil glued the loops together like no one else.
Even Gertrud had to pitch in until deep into the night... so everything was ready by November 1st.
The film material didn't have any perforation yet.
we punched it ourselves... with shoe grommets.
we downright cobbled them together these first loops.
The whole thing was only possible because everyone participated.
Eugen...
Emil... the little one... and I.
I'm tearing it all apart, right?
Otherwise it's still the original format... films were cut, pieces were cut out and these are the leftovers.
Since the whole thing was done in secret... we couldn't allow any curious onlookers... much to the chagrin of Emil, who wanted to impress his Josephine.
My advice to Emil was to keep away from women... but it fell on deaf ears.
I only know about the drama from hear-say.
If I had known that Emil was head over heels for this curious woman...
I never would've hung these film loops... on the laundry line to dry.
No one knew about it, aside from Gertrud, who was playing guard... that Emil shot the Serpentine Dance with Josephine in the crack of dawn.
And even the milk man, gutsy Wilhelm, did not say a word to me.
Berliners were filled with excitement... about this new world sensation.
The bioscope was the talk of the town.
Yes, and then November 1st came around.
while the legs of the Cancan troupe were whirling through the air... we were very nervous behind the screen.
Tension was rising in the hall.
And then came the act right before ours:
the "levitating virgin" cut in two in the middle.
In the Wintergarten we had "Juggler"...
"Boxing Kangaroo", "Children's Dance"...
"Tscherpanoffs", "Grunato Family"... and "The wrestling Match." Six films altogether.
Those were ready by August... but the directors of the Wintergarten... wouldn't show them until November 1st.
Five years we had worked for this moment... and now my fingers were trembling so much...
I couldn't get the filmstrip into the darn projector!
Especially when Emil already showed the title of the first film... and things were about to start.
ITALIAN PEASANT DANCE But that darn bioscope... wasn't working.
It just wasn't willing to show even one glimpse.
No wonder.
The bulb had burned out.
we had to buy some time.
Gertrud once again had the life-saving idea... and sent Eugen into combat.
The Dorn and the Baron...
well, they were very upset!
They made a great, big fuss and threatened to sue us... said they wanted their money back... if things didn't start happening "immediately."
Yes, and then it started.
JUGGLER
One other mishap occurred.
Instead of the kangaroo, I put in the wrong loop.
These were scraps that were not meant for viewing.
So, in the premiere, of all things, we showed not a boxing kangaroo... but a scared marsupial that absolutely did not want to box... trying to escape the ring several times!
ACROBATIC POTPOURRI
KAMMARINTZKY TRIO
WRESTLING MATCH
SERPENTINE DANCE
All's well that ends well.
During all this commotion, even I didn't detect the swindle... and did not see the difference between Mademoiselle and Josephine.
Before November 1st, 1895...
APOTHEOSIS it didn't exist.
while Emil whispered sweet nothings to Josephine in the audience... and I cranked the bioscope until my arm fell off...
Emil and I stood on stage as our own look-alikes... and accepted the thunderous applause.
All this exaltation brought a tear to my eye behind the screen.
This is the new era!
This is cinema!
Two months later we would have had our engagement in Paris.
It was supposed to be the crowning event of the whole thing.
Our bioscope in the "Folies Bergères"!
But as you can see, it didn't happen.
we were uninvited at the last moment.
They paid our fee in its entirety... but we weren't allowed to have our presentation.
Instead we now celebrate the triumph of August and Louis Lumière.
Their "Cinematograph" is far superior to my bioscope.
Hats off!
The French just had the better patent... which guarantied better picture quality and movement... than my old double projector system.
That's all water under the bridge now.
The Lumières did not just show a bunch of patched together loops... but long, real-life strips... of almost a minute long!
That is a real world sensation!
Keep your head up, Emil!
There is still plenty to do.
This is just the beginning of cinema!
we have to solve the problem of color film... and "3-D photography" for which I have gathered a few ideas.
Our premiere happened eight weeks earlier!
Nobody can take that away from us.
The money and the fame for the cinema goes to someone else... but we were the first... and now you know that too!
Dad always started something new, once one thing was gone.
If one thing didn't work anymore... when the vivid pictures were no more... he came up with the Plastograph... and then the Mignon Stereo, and later slides.
Could you tell us something about that too?
-Excuse me?
-About this here.
This here, yes.
This is a P.F.A. Film, "Projection For All".
why did he call it "projection for all"?
Yes.
Because he later released the glass images... that were projected to the screen.
So a projection for all!
The slide series.
There were 92 series.
You can say that I have colored, well, thousands of images.
Each page had 24 pictures.
The most I did one day was 1 44 pictures.
That took a lot out of me.
when it came to drawing, I was the best in school.
I got that from dad.
Not so my sisters.
They didn't have an artistic vein in their body.
So my dad always said.
I had a lot of fun.
There was a stand, below was a mirror... then a piece of frosted glass on which the picture was laid.
It was lit from below, and you would use brush and palette to fill it up.
Each series came with a lecture book... in which each image was described in 1 O to 1 2 lines.
So, when someone was to give a lecture they could simply read that.
My dad wrote these lecture books himself.
These are all enlarged photos of him.
You had to look at them with green-red glasses... so the plastics would become visible.
And this photo is as old as I am, 91 years.
These pictures are all from my dad.
They were delivered in albums and in the front was a pocket... which held the glasses, they came with it.
This is also over 80 years old and survived two wars.
This wasn't your only profession.
You did other things too.
Yes, yes.
I went... to the Reimann art school... and I studied drawing for fashion and advertising.
Anything else?
we have found another photo of you.
Yes, this picture here, that's me.
I designed and sewed that dress myself.
It was white organdy... which was in fashion in '38.
I made it for a summer party.
I prefer that fashion to the one of today.
Beautiful.
I have something else here on the table, what is this?
This is... what dad had a patent for.
Color photography, photography with artificial colors.
This is a yellow, a blue and a red plate... which were put on top of one another... and then produced a natural color picture.
And the patent was for the emulsion that was in it...
There should be three colors.
One seems to be missing.
So... he got the patent.
The emulsion was mixed with additives... so different colors would be produced.
Color...
This is the blue... the yellow and the red... and on each one is the bouquet... and one on top of the other produced the picture.
For this, dad had a patent.
Most people didn't know that.
where did your father spend his last years?
Here, in this house.
I took care of him.
Dad died of colon cancer, but never spent a day in the hospital.
I took care of him until the very end.
And it didn't start until October, so it was a very short time.
From September... until November 30th... when he died.
Before that, he would still run around.
He just collapsed all of a sudden when the war started.
when my brother was drafted, that took a big toll on him.
He simply collapsed and never recovered.
Do you remember Uncle Emil and Uncle Eugen?
when my grandfather died, the siblings no longer talked to Emil... because of the inheritance.
I didn't meet Uncle Emil until 1 935... when the sign was put up at the Wintergarten.
Uncle Eugen always said he was a bon vivant.
He spent a lot of time at the race track and things like that.
He was different from the other two brothers.
They were more solid.
This is Uncle Eugen!
This is the best picture of Uncle Eugen as a clown.
There he was a clown, Eugen.
This must be from...
This is from the movie...
"The Nightly Suitor."
It was a short.
And from the "Virgin of Orleans."
This is Uncle Eugen, dressed as a virgin... and here too.
This is the parade of admirers.
And those were all working in our company.
This one here, I remember him.
His name was Max Büttner, and he was our butler.
They did it with enthusiasm.
Dad never sold a patent.
He said that, if he couldn't use it, no one else would be able to either.
He was stubborn, and I believe I also inherited that.
This was shot was at the Schlosspark Niederschönhausen.
One of the last photos of my father.
DEDICATED TO THE MANY FORGOTTEN PIONEERS OF FILM
we saw the very first film ever that had sound.
It was shot in the chicken run.
The chicken run, the chickens cluck, nothing else.
-Cut!
-Keep going.
-Come on, keep going!
-It's all right.
Dad!
Dad!
There are some people here from the film!
No, kids, no!
The Lumière Brothers with their so-called Cinematograph...
Graphomat or something.
-Is this Uncle Emil, the other?
-Yes.
He had his hair cut really short.
You didn't see that?
well, something like that.
-This is supposed to be dad?
-Yes.
-This is supposed to be dad?
-On the bioscope.
well, you should have asked before.
He never wore glasses.
It's not historically correct.
He looks even smarter with glasses, doesn't he?
what am I doing here?
Is it okay, if I lean back this far?
Okay.
One, 13C, take one.
SPECIAL THANKS THE POTSDAM FILM MUSEUM,
WHOSE LARGE FILM STOCK WE WERE ALLOWED TO SHOOT.
How did you like our movie?
well... the love story of Uncle Emil... that was...
How do you call that?
Artistic liberty during the shoot.
The rest was pretty authentic.
THE END ...UNLESS THEY WANT TO WATCH SOME MORE
So, son, you bored yet?
Dad...
Hmm...
Getting a little choppy.
Dad, did you see that?
Nope.
The city sleeps uneasily tonight as unconfirmed reports trickle in.
Apparently, there have been several sightings, once again, unconfirmed, of the spidery steel mobile home belonging to the 20th century's most notorious supervillain,
The Terror.
The Terror, pictured here with infamous Soviet dictator, Joseph Stalin, burst upon the supervillain scene early in the summer of 103 in a legendary fight, with then President, Theodore Roosevelt.
This began an unparalleled career of epic wrongdoings.
Paris, Lima, Deertown.
No corner of the globe is safe from The Terror's reign of...
Terror.
Last sighted in 176,
The Terror, still holding a grudge, tried to punch out Mount Rushmore.
Could The Terror be back?
Tonight, a terrifie city cringes in its collective pajamas.
More, as it evelops.
Mmm...
Yes, destiny has her hand on my back, and she's pushing.
Face to face with the legendary Terror.
Oh, come on.
The guy's gotta be, what, 115?
Evil, chum, is ever green.
Besides, these are just unconfirmed reports.
Unconfirmed?
What are the odds?
We've got to upgrade the apparatus.
We've got to get cool new superhero stuff to battle this all-encompassing evil.
And who's gonna pay for all this cool new stuff?
That's not the point.
Step one.
We must choose battle cries.
The cries we emit just before leaping into battle.
Oh, you mean like, "Not in the face, not in the face"?
Hmm...
Lacks force, chum.
No, more like, uh... spoon!
- Mmm...
I don't get it.
- Spoon!
Look, I'm just a sidekick.
I don't know, Dot, it's some kind of crime-busting tower.
We're upgrading our apparatus.
It's been going on like this all week.
Swinging!
I just...
I just don't know if I can afford it.
The Tick doesn't make any money.
He's a superhero.
Whoa.
Well, "I told you so" doesn't help.
It works, Arthur!
Dot, you're my sister.
Try to be a little supportive.
Arthur, is that your fine sister on the phone?
Tell her we need her car.
We've got to deliver something to city hall.
Welcome, supervillains.
I have gathered you here to form the most beautifully unbalanced engine of evil in history.
Now, then, you all know me...
The Terror.
But let me introduce your new colleagues in crime.
On my left, Tuun-La Not of this Earth.
The human race is an inferior species.
I will destroy you all.
Yes, yes.
And next to Tuun-La, my old buddy, Joseph Stalin.
And, across the table from Joe, fresh from America's dairy land,
The Man-Eating Cow.
And, finally, weighing in at 2000 pounds of pure evil,
The Human Ton.
And his little friend, Handy.
Hi, everybody.
OK, now for openers, we take over the city!
What?
Where have you been?
The city's protected by the Tick now.
Yes, I've heard he's quite dangerous.
What are you afraid of?
We've got Stalin.
Oh, uh, excuse me, but I am not actually Stalin.
I'm Stalingrad, a former graduate student in Russian Studies turned supervillain.
I base my work on the works on Joseph Stalin.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you look like Stalin to me.
It's an homage, you jerk!
You're losing it!
You're out of the loop!
Yeah, out of the loop.
In fact, I think this group could use a new leader.
I nominate... me.
Hands up, who wants me?
Hey, you can't have two votes.
Soon, I will annihilate your planet.
But, in the meantime, I vote for The Terror.
That's it, sweetheart, 23 skiddoo.
I nominate myself.
Hey, hey, hey!
I lead this.
You hear that?
The Man-Eating Cow votes for me.
And so, Mayor Blank, to even better protect this city,
Arthur and I wish to present you with this.
The Tick Signal.
In the event of a city emergency, you have but to aim this beam at a conveniently passing cluster of clouds, and we will speed to the scene dispensing justice left and right.
- You know, we have your phone number.
- Also useful.
The thing is, boys, we've got a lot of these gizmos and I gotta tell ya, they just don't work.
Every time we flash the Die Fledermaus signal, he disconnects his phone and leaves town.
How much did you pay for that?
But you still haven't told me how much all this stuff is costing.
Nothing, chum.
I put it on your credit cards.
- What?
- Oh, Arthur, you're such an accountant.
Come over here and look at this, it's great.
It's our new secret message cannon.
Go ahead, go ahead, ask me how it works.
OK, I'll tell you.
First, write a secret message.
Then, place the message into the secret message shell.
Load.
Select target.
And fire.
That ought to wake up the boys at the diner.
Hmm. "You are a kind and generous person.
Your lucky numbers are three, seven and 42."
This is the Pendecker Series pneumatic grappling hook with full body harness and power winch.
Tick, I'm serious.
We can't afford this.
We've got to take some of this stuff back.
Oh, but wait till you see it work.
Oh.
Good morning, Arthur, sleep well?
What's all this?
This morning I went out and picked up some more equipment.
You what?
!
I would've gotten more, but they cut up your credit cards.
My...
Yes, but look what I got.
A crime lab!
Arthur, we've got a crime lab now.
All kinds of crime chemicals!
Look, I can make this red liquid turn totally clear.
Get out!
Get out of my apartment!
- What?
- Get out of my apartment!
No.
No.
Get out of my life!
Say, does that look like Joseph Stalin to you?
Oh, yeah, Stalin, definitely Stalin.
You told him to get out of your life?
Oh, Arthur.
I just don't know what to do.
He's been up in that crime tower of his for almost a week.
He's not going on patrol, he's not fighting evil.
He's not being a superhero anymore.
Well, Arthur, you know the Tick isn't my favorite person, but he is your best friend.
- Was.
- And let's face it, you haven't had a lot of friends.
Thank you, Dot.
I really think you should just go talk to him.
Try to work this out.
I can't.
You talk to him.
Hmm...
- OK, I will.
- You will?
So Arthur really kicked The Tick out of his apartment?
Yeah, they say he went insane and blew the place up with chemicals.
- Ooh, chemicals.
- Uh-huh, yeah, that's right.
And now he's just sitting up there in his crime tower and won't talk to anyone.
But this is bad, isn't it?
What if The Terror attacks the city?
Oh, what if it rains?
Very bad.
?
When no one unerstans you
?
Or the little things you o
?
When estiny, she strans you
?
Or wears you like a shoe
?
That's when you know it's over
?
Man, that's when you know it's through
?
I never thought I' be
?
So big
?
An blue?
The Tick has put himself out of commission.
The city is ours.
Ha-cha!
We're in like Flynn.
Yeah!
Even now, he sulks like Achilles in his tent.
Achilles.
It's The Ilia.
It's Homer!
Read a book!
Here we go!
Hang on to your hats.
Tick?
Tick, why don't you come down and talk to Arthur?
Arthur?
Arthur.
Hmm...
Oh, yes.
I used to have a sidekick named Arthur.
But he sidekicked me out of the apartment.
Tick, you're being very immature about this.
- Am not!
- Arthur, this is hopeless.
- Are too!
- Dot.
Well, he started it.
Hey, Arthur.
How are things going?
Hi, American Maid.
The boys are fighting.
?
When no one unerstans you
?
Or the little things you o
Feeling pretty sorry for ourselves up here, aren't we?
The world just isn't what I want it to be anymore.
Well, that's just great.
And suppose The Terror decides to attack the city?
- I don't care.
- I don't believe that's true.
You always love and protect the city.
It's who you are.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Forget it, the guy is nuts.
Let's just hope he snaps out of it before anything serious happens here.
Resistance is futile, human worm.
We have the mayor!
The city is ours!
One small problem, Comrade Handy, the police have us surrounded.
Oh, don't sweat it, Joe.
When you've been in the business as long as I have, you get hip.
Dig this, cats.
Attention, coppers!
This is The Terror.
Hi.
Listen, if you want to see your mayor again, then hit the road.
We own this burgh, see?
You know, you'll never get away with this.
Ha!
They always say that.
And I always get away with it.
We've got to save the mayor.
Well, if the Tick was here, he...
I'd have to think of something.
OK, you grab the mayor and I'll create a diversion.
Are you sure you want to do that?
No.
My name is Arthur and this is my diversion.
The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Up came the sun and dried up all the rain.
And the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again.
- Is he finished?
- Oh, yeah.
He's finished.
Not in the face, not in the face!
Hang on, mayor.
We've got to jump.
I don't think so, miss.
Mayor Blank, please.
Oh, destiny, destiny!
What would you have of me?
Just give me a sign.
Anything.
Oh, that's not bad.
Your Tick won't come, he sulking in his tent like a guy from Chile.
Don't you mean Achilles?
You're making us look like jerks!
I told you, read a book!
Spoon!
Spoon!
Spoon!
Oh, it's just the wind.
Don't be such a nervous Nellie.
Whoa!
So this is the mighty Tick.
You've got that right, weirdo.
Villains, I say to you, stop your evil ways!
Get him!
Get up, you big oaf, get up!
Tick, you're back!
All right!
Who's next?
I've always loved you.
Joseph Stalin, grab onto my armored muumuu.
Together we will leave this foul Earth behind.
Eew.
Joe, you rat!
Who needs you?
American Maid, catch that Terror.
Arthur, grab that bad cow.
I'll handle the monster downstairs.
OK, just take it easy.
That rotten old coot!
I'm...
Don't just stand there, eat his head!
See, he's eating your head and I can still talk.
He's eating, I'm speaking.
He's eating, I'm speaking.
How do we do it?
I'll deal with you later.
Hey, leave him alone!
You want a piece of me?
Come and get it, moth boy.
I still got the moxie.
OK, old man.
I'm putting an end to your century of terror.
Oh, it's a woman.
I'm so scared.
Times have changed, pops.
Way to chew!
Finish him off!
Handy?
Yes!
No!
I don't think that puppet's going to give us any more trouble, chum.
Well, Arthur, it looks like we've done it again.
And even though it's been a terrible week for me and harsh words have passed between us,
I forgive you.
What?
You can't forgive me.
- I forgive you.
- Well, OK, then.
An I' like to thank the Tick, Arthur an American Mai for coming through when their city neee them most.
Thank you, Mayor Blank.
We all enjoye saving your life.
You know, evil comes in many forms.
Be it a man-eating cow or Joseph Stalin.
But you can't let the package hie the puing.
Evil is just plain ba.
You on't cotton to it.
You've got to smack it in the nose with the rolle up newspaper of gooness.
Ba og!
Ba og!
An you on't o it for money.
No.
You o it for love.
You know, I learne something this past week.
On justice an on frienship, there is no price.
But there are establishe creit limits.
Well, kids, that's all you get.
That's it.
Read a book!

[Lowing]
The Tick has put himself out of commission.
The city is ours.
Ha-cha!
We're in like Flynn.
[Laughing, coughing]
[Laughs] Yeah!
Even now, he sulks like Achilles in his tent.
Achilles.
It's The Ilia.
[Humming]
It's Homer!
Read a book!
[Chuckling] Here we go!
Hang on to your hats.
[All grunting]
[Cackling]
[Coughing]
[Dot] Tick?
Tick, why don't you come down and talk to Arthur?
[Tick] Arthur?
Arthur.
Hmm...
Oh, yes.
I used to have a sidekick named Arthur.
But he sidekicked me out of the apartment.
Tick, you're being very immature about this.
- [Tick] Am not!
- Arthur, this is hopeless.
- Are too!
- Dot.
Well, he started it.
Hey, Arthur.
How are things going?
Hi, American Maid.
The boys are fighting.
[Tick]?
When no one unerstans you
?
Or the little things you o
Feeling pretty sorry for ourselves up here, aren't we?
The world just isn't what I want it to be anymore.
Well, that's just great.
And suppose The Terror decides to attack the city?
- I don't care.
- I don't believe that's true.
You always love and protect the city.
It's who you are.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Forget it, the guy is nuts.
Let's just hope he snaps out of it before anything serious happens here.
[Sirens wailing]
[Blank straining]
Resistance is futile, human worm.
We have the mayor!
The city is ours!
One small problem, Comrade Handy, the police have us surrounded.
Oh, don't sweat it, Joe.
When you've been in the business as long as I have, you get hip.
Dig this, cats.
[Over PA] Attention, coppers!
This is The Terror.
Hi.
Listen, if you want to see your mayor again, then hit the road.
We own this burgh, see?
[cackling]
[Coughing]
You know, you'll never get away with this.
Ha!
They always say that.
And I always get away with it.
[All laughing]
We've got to save the mayor.
Well, if the Tick was here, he I'd have to think of something.
OK, you grab the mayor and I'll create a diversion.
Are you sure you want to do that?
No.
[Clears throat] My name is Arthur and this is my diversion.
The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Up came the sun and dried up all the rain.
And the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again.
- Is he finished?
- Oh, yeah.
He's finished.
Not in the face, not in the face!
[Grunts]
Hang on, mayor.
We've got to jump.
I don't think so, miss.
Mayor Blank, please.
[Both straining]
Oh, destiny, destiny!
What would you have of me?
Just give me a sign.
Anything.
Oh, that's not bad.
[Laughing] Your Tick won't come, he sulking in his tent like a guy from Chile.
Don't you mean Achilles?
You're making us look like jerks!
I told you, read a book!
[Tick] Spoon!
Spoon!
[Thunder crashes]
Spoon!
[Lowing]
Oh, it's just the wind.
Don't be such a nervous Nellie.
Whoa!
So this is the mighty Tick.
You've got that right, weirdo.
Villains, I say to you, stop your evil ways!
- Get him!
- [Growling]
[Grunting]
Get up, you big oaf, get up!
Tick, you're back!
All right!
Who's next?
I've always loved you.
Joseph Stalin, grab onto my armored muumuu.
Together we will leave this foul Earth behind.
Eew.
Joe, you rat!
Who needs you?
American Maid, catch that Terror.
Arthur, grab that bad cow.
I'll handle the monster downstairs.
[Clang]
OK, just take it easy.
[Growling, slurping]
That rotten old coot!
I'm... [mumbling]
Don't just stand there, eat his head!
OK.
[Groaning]
See, he's eating your head and I can still talk.
He's eating, I'm speaking.
He's eating, I'm speaking.
How do we do it?
I'll deal with you later.
Hey, leave him alone!
You want a piece of me?
Come and get it, moth boy.
[Grunting]
[Groaning]
[Chuckling] I still got the moxie.
[Cackling]
OK, old man.
I'm putting an end to your century of terror.
Oh, it's a woman.
I'm so scared.
[Grunting]
Times have changed, pops.
[Laughing] Way to chew!
Finish him off!
Handy?
[Screaming]
Yes!
No!
I don't think that puppet's going to give us any more trouble, chum.
Well, Arthur, it looks like we've done it again.
And even though it's been a terrible week for me and harsh words have passed between us,
I forgive you.
What?
You can't forgive me.
- I forgive you.
- Well, OK, then.
An I' like to thank the Tick, Arthur an American Mai for coming through when their city neee them most.
Thank you, Mayor Blank.
We all enjoye saving your life.
You know, evil comes in many forms.
Be it a man-eating cow or Joseph Stalin.
But you can't let the package hie the puing.
Evil is just plain ba.
You on't cotton to it.
You've got to smack it in the nose with the rolle up newspaper of gooness.
Ba og!
Ba og!
An you on't o it for money.
No.
You o it for love.
You know, I learne something this past week.
On justice an on frienship, there is no price.
But there are establishe creit limits.
Well, kids, that's all you get.
That's it.
Read a book!
Wait till y'all see this, this is huge.
If you xeroxed your butt again, I'm not interested.
Uncle Phil, wait till you see this bill.
Lisa spent $1200 on a bed.
I hope it comes with a canopy because at that price, it's the only roof we'll have over our heads.
Well, get used to it, Will.
You're about to marry and you know how women are.
No, Philip, how are we?
Fine.
And you?
I'm telling you, it's not like Lisa to spend this kind of money.
I'm telling you, she's possessed.
It's like some evil force has taken over her mind.
Something not of this Earth.
Hi, everyone.
Is Lisa here yet?
We're going shopping again today.
Ah!
Excuse me.
Hey, what's up, bro?
How you doing?
Looking for my cousin, she works on the next set.
She's the host of the Hilary Banks Show.
What's her name?
Cleopatra Jones.
Cleopatra Jones.
Brother, look, she's tall, light-skinned sister.
She drives a red Maserati.
Oh, dag, that's your cousin?
She's fine.
She's right over there.
Thank you.
Hey, tell Cleopatra Reggie said, "What's up?"
MAN [ON PA]:
Cameras and audio, stand by, please.
Hey, Hil, what's up?
Look, I'm in a little bit of a bind here.
Now, I found Lisa's engagement ring, but I don't get paid until Thursday.
I was wondering, could you lend me a couple of hundred for the deposit?
HILARY:
I think I'm gonna faint.
[HILARY GIGGLES]
All right, but while you're down, can I get some dough out your wallet?
Hi.
Hilary Banks, right?
[HILARY GIGGLES]
I'm pretty sure he's talking to you.
I see you around here a lot.
You like our show?
I can't take my eyes off it.
Can I touch it?
INA:
Places, everybody.
JERRY:
People, work like you're being paid.
One more scene and we're home.
What a fabulous butt.
You know, it gets me around.
INA:
Please, and we're counting in five, four, three, two...
The police think I killed Carlos.
But on the night he was killed, you were here with me, painting my portrait.
You can give me an alibi.
I'll go to the police now.
All right, but be careful.
The roads are so icy.
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Royce I owe you my life.
INA:
We're clear.
Get rid of that kid, Jerry.
I think he's a pretty good actor.
Well, who cares?
I'm the star, and I say replace him.
Hey, you can't treat an actor like that.
What do you think he is, a writer?
WILL:
Okay, please.
Hil, I gotta be honest, I kind of agree with her.
I mean, come on, man, the dude's a brother and he ain't supposed to be like, "I'm looking for a Julius Caesar salad. "
I mean, come on, man, you know, he got to be down here, you know.
Hey, look, baby, you need the cops, we don't need to go down the station.
All I got to do is walk out your front door carrying your TV, you know, okay, man.
Who in the hell is this?
Our new Royce.
Hire him, Jerry.
Now.
Huh?
You're not gonna believe what happened.
I've got some great news.
You're moving out?
- Even better.
- I'm moving out?
VIVIAN:
I can't wait to hear your great news, honey.
- Listen...
- I'm gonna have to.
Troy and I are working late on our book tonight.
- Troy?
- Mm-hm.
Professor T. Johnson is a Troy?
- What did you think the T stood for?
- I was hoping Thelma.
Bye-bye, everybody.
- Bye, Mom.
- Love you, Mom.
Can we get back to moi, please?
I got a part on that soap opera, Now and Forever.
Oh, please.
They hired you somebody who's never acted in his life, to star in a network TV show.
Pppt.
Well, it happens.
Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, my money troubles are over.
I need you to check out my contract.
Man, I ain't seen so many zeros since Carlton's square dance recital.
Hardy har, hello.
What a sense of humor.
And you don't think this guy has talent.
You know, you're going to the top, Will.
But you're overlooking one small thing.
What?
You mean beside that little chocolate Tic Tac you call your head?
Ha, ha.
Killing me.
He's killing me.
Ha, ha.
But, seriously, Will, you know, you're going to need management.
- Someone to look out for you.
Someone to...
- Take 10 percent.
Why, I'd love to.
Will, aren't you nervous about acting?
I mean, that show's done live.
Nervous?
What are you talking about?
I'm a natural.
I can do this part in my sleep.
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
Do I play a convincing coma victim or what?
Well, you're no Sunny Von Bulow.
Ha, ha, ha.
Look, laugh if you want to but tomorrow, I'm coming out of my coma.
- You're actually gonna speak?
- Right, I called all my boys in Philly.
They're gonna watch it on a big-screen TV.
I just hope that Sears lets them stay for the whole show.
You still want me to help you learn your lines?
Oh, yeah, and I'll help you into the kitchen.
Oh, you know, ever since I bought her this big old ring...
[WILL GRUNTING] ...she have a hard time walking without falling over.
Come on, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.
- Wanna see Will's show?
We have it on tape.
- No, soap operas don't interest me.
Oh, this one's hot, Daddy.
See, Joan was having an affair with Carlos right behind her husband's back.
Not that they were in the same room or anything.
Joan lied, told her husband she'd been working late at the office writing her memoirs.
That reminds me, Mrs. Banks called to say she'll be working late again with Professor Johnson at her office writing her book.
Jody, I can't believe my eyes.
Please, come closer.
Oh, Royce, I'll never leave you again.
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
Hey!
What you doing?
That wasn't in my script.
Well, that kiss wasn't in mine.
Oh, well, come on, baby.
That was a ad-lib.
All us good actors do it.
That ain't personal.
I might as well be kissing Flavor Flav, gold teeth and all.
Will, the only person I want you kissing on is me.
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, now, come on, baby, be fair.
The only reason I even took this job was to put that ring on your finger and to make you happy.
So if I have to crawl into bed with 10 beautiful woman that's just a sacrifice I'm gonna have to make.
INA:
All right, people, places.
Coming back from commercial in 10 seconds.
Excuse me, but I can't flush the commode.
C, it's a prop.
Nice seeing you again, Joan.
JERRY:
I need show energy, people.
Okay, stand by, Ina, and counting.
INA [ON SPEAKERS]:
Coming in five, four, three, two...
Oh, Royce, thank God you're conscious.
Now you can confirm my alibi.
But first, there's someone here who can't wait another moment to see you.
Not...
- Not...
- That's right.
Jody.
Hello, sleepyhead.
I'll leave you two alone.
You have a lot of catching up to do.
No, wait.
Jody I can't believe my eyes.
Please, come closer.
Royce...
Royce, tell me you love me.
I love you.
Royce, I don't blame you for being angry with me, I don't.
But I promise, I'll never leave you alone again.
[MAKES SQUEAKY NOISE]
I can't tell you how that makes me feel.
PHILIP:
Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.
I don't believe it.
Vivian's working late with the professor again.
Do you realize she has missed dinner every night this week?
And yet, inexplicably, we've had no leftovers.
Can I ask you a question?
If you were a woman would you find me attractive?
Nope.
Well, now, I know this is gonna sound absurd but I think Vivian and the professor are having...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Oh, sir, surely not.
The two of them have absolutely nothing in common.
Why, he's 15 years her junior.
Whatever would they do together?
Hey, baby, you know, I've been thinking.
You know, I'm gonna quit.
I know how uncomfortable the love scenes make you.
They don't make me uncomfortable.
Oh, sure they do.
[MUMBLING]
Will, that was before you explained it to me.
I believe you said, and I quote:
"I might as well be kissing Flavor Flav. "
But, of course, that was when Flavor Flav was a woman.
Hey, look here, man.
That ain't got nothing to do with it.
Besides, ain't you got something to do?
No, sadly, this is the high point of my day.
That and coming up with names for my Chia Pet.
What do you think of Larry?
La-la-la Larry.
Larry.
[LISA LAUGHS]
Look, babe, the truth is, I'm just not that good an actor.
Well, you seem like you're doing a pretty good job to me right now.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Don't worry, you're gonna do just fine.
You know what?
You're right, I am.
Thanks a lot, babe, I feel a whole lot better.
I'm gonna go out there and knock them dead.
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.
Carlton, please get me off the show.
Are you insane?
If you quit, you don't get paid.
But what's most important is, I don't get paid.
Look, the only way you can leave and still get the money is if they fire you.
Carlton, sometimes, man, I just wanna hug you.
Oh...
But this ain't one of them times.
MAN [ON TV]:
Now and Forever will be right back after these messages.
Master William's scene is next.
I must say, it is exciting watching him on the telly.
I guess, but it's true what they say, being on TV does add 10 pounds.
So does watching it.
Will, isn't this rewrite great?
- Oh, I haven't read it yet.
- Will, are you crazy?
Do you realize you're live on air in 60 seconds?
Oh, yep, yep.
INA:
Places, people.
JERRY:
Okay, people, one more scene and we're on the freeway.
Oh, my God.
Ina, get that damn midget manager off my set.
Doesn't he know those stairs go nowhere?
- Get ready to count.
- In five, four, three, two...
To freedom.
I'll drink to that.
Royce, if it wasn't for you, I'd be in prison right now.
I should be the happiest woman alive.
[WHIMPERS]
You still miss Carlos, don't you?
More than I can say.
I know how you feel.
I know you do.
You love Jody so very much.
Actually, uh...
We...
We broke up.
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
She's a pro, she'll get the kid back.
Uh, don't you mean that you, uh...?
That you, uh...
You thought about breaking up, but decided against it and now your love is stronger than ever?
No, no, like I told you, we broke up.
You wanna dance?
Come on.
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
Any minute, my husband's gonna come through that door.
- Now can we panic?
- Cue dough boy.
I don't care if he's not ready, get him in there now, now, now!
I said, any minute now my husband is going to walk through that door and say...
Where are we?
Derek, darling, what a surprise.
What are you doing here so early?
I don't know.
Sure you do.
You came here to give her something.
Remember?
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry it had to end this way, my dear.
If only my little plot to frame you had worked.
You mean, you killed Carlos?
No, that was me.
That's right, I shot Carlos.
And that's not all.
I'm the one who shot J.R. too.
And I shot the sheriff.
But I did not shoot the deputy.
Do you ever wanna work in this town again?
Painting portraits?
No.
But you see, I'm young and I'm restless.
I only got one life to live so I got to follow my guiding light and search for tomorrow.
Follow him, camera four.
I don't care if he goes to the commissary.
Hey, who knows if I'll wind up living out the days of my life in a mansion in Dallas on the comer of Melrose Place drinking Falcon Crest out of a brown paper bag.
Royce, don't you care about anybody but yourself?
Sure I do.
I care about you.
It's not because of those expensive clothes or your fancy jewelry.
That big Zsa Zsa wig you've be wearing.
I love you for who you are.
Who you really are.
The bald and the beautiful.
Isn't this great?
I told Daddy the soaps aren't predictable.
Got that right.
[JOAN SHRIEKING]
MAN:
Tune in tomorrow for another episode of Now and Forever.
INA:
We're clear.
What the hell do you think you were doing?
I want him fired, Jerry.
Fired!
Now, wait a minute, hey.
If I get fired, you still got to give me mine.
- Ain't that right, C?
CARLTON:
That's right.
I demand you give my client what's coming to him.
Oh, I'd be glad to.
[THUMP]
Sir, this is a letter to Mrs. Banks from him.
Oh, just go for it, sir.
I'll swear it came that way.
- "Dear Vivian... "
- Good Lord.
Oh, I can't believe it either.
He called her "dear. "
- Philip, are you reading my mail?
PHILIP:
Hm?
It didn't come this way.
So now you know.
Philip, I didn't want you to find out this way.
What were you gonna do?
Throw me a surprise party?
No, but I wanted to be with you when you read it.
"To the most important person in my life my beloved husband, Philip whose support and patience have made this book possible.
I love you always, Vivian. "
You dedicated your book to me.
Of course, sweetheart.
Who else was I going to dedicate it to?
Professor Johnson?
That noodle-neck kid stomps on my last nerve.
- I love you.
- Aw.
WILL:
Hey, hey, Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv.
Get a room.
Interesting performance, Master William.
I haven't seen such a disaster on the telly since they cancelled Manimal.
Well, I got paid, didn't I?
I'm gonna just sob all the way to the bank.
You know what I'm saying?
[WILL CARLTON FEIGNS CRYING]
Oh, Will, it's too bad you won't get a chance to work with Halle Barry.
Please tell me you meant Chuck Berry.
Well, it's all here in Soap Opera News.
Apparently you or whatever lucky devil will be playing Royce...
According to this, Royce is moving in with Miss Berry next week.
- Didn't you get your script?
- Ah!
I knew there was something I forgot.
Head start, coming in five, four, three, two...

C, it's a prop.
Nice seeing you again, Joan.
JERRY:
I need show energy, people.
Okay, stand by, Ina, and counting.
INA [ON SPEAKERS]:
Coming in five, four, three, two...
Oh, Royce, thank God you're conscious.
Now you can confirm my alibi.
But first, there's someone here who can't wait another moment to see you.
Not...
- Not...
- That's right.
Jody.
Hello, sleepyhead.
I'll leave you two alone.
You have a lot of catching up to do.
No, wait.
Jody I can't believe my eyes.
Please, come closer.
Royce...
Royce, tell me you love me.
I love you.
Royce, I don't blame you for being angry with me, I don't.
But I promise, I'll never leave you alone again.
[MAKES SQUEAKY NOISE]
I can't tell you how that makes me feel.
PHILIP:
Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.
I don't believe it.
Vivian's working late with the professor again.
Do you realize she has missed dinner every night this week?
And yet, inexplicably, we've had no leftovers.
Can I ask you a question?
If you were a woman would you find me attractive?
Nope.
Well, now, I know this is gonna sound absurd but I think Vivian and the professor are having...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Oh, sir, surely not.
The two of them have absolutely nothing in common.
Why, he's 15 years her junior.
Whatever would they do together?
Hey, baby, you know, I've been thinking.
You know, I'm gonna quit.
I know how uncomfortable the love scenes make you.
They don't make me uncomfortable.
Oh, sure they do.
[MUMBLING]
Will, that was before you explained it to me.
I believe you said, and I quote:
"I might as well be kissing Flavor Flav. "
But, of course, that was when Flavor Flav was a woman.
Hey, look here, man.
That ain't got nothing to do with it.
Besides, ain't you got something to do?
No, sadly, this is the high point of my day.
That and coming up with names for my Chia Pet.
What do you think of Larry?
La-la-la Larry.
Larry.
[LISA LAUGHS]
Look, babe, the truth is, I'm just not that good an actor.
Well, you seem like you're doing a pretty good job to me right now.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Don't worry, you're gonna do just fine.
You know what?
You're right, I am.
Thanks a lot, babe, I feel a whole lot better.
I'm gonna go out there and knock them dead.
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.
Carlton, please get me off the show.
Are you insane?
If you quit, you don't get paid.
But what's most important is, I don't get paid.
Look, the only way you can leave and still get the money is if they fire you.
Carlton, sometimes, man, I just wanna hug you.
Oh...
But this ain't one of them times.
MAN [ON TV]:
Now and Forever will be right back after these messages.
Master William's scene is next.
I must say, it is exciting watching him on the telly.
I guess, but it's true what they say, being on TV does add 10 pounds.
So does watching it.
Will, isn't this rewrite great?
- Oh, I haven't read it yet.
- Will, are you crazy?
Do you realize you're live on air in 60 seconds?
Oh, yep, yep.
INA:
Places, people.
JERRY:
Okay, people, one more scene and we're on the freeway.
Oh, my God.
Ina, get that damn midget manager off my set.
Doesn't he know those stairs go nowhere?
- Get ready to count.
- In five, four, three, two...
To freedom.
I'll drink to that.
Royce, if it wasn't for you, I'd be in prison right now.
I should be the happiest woman alive.
[WHIMPERS]
You still miss Carlos, don't you?
More than I can say.
I know how you feel.
I know you do.
You love Jody so very much.
Actually, uh...
We...
We broke up.
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
She's a pro, she'll get the kid back.
Uh, don't you mean that you, uh...?
That you, uh...
You thought about breaking up, but decided against it and now your love is stronger than ever?
No, no, like I told you, we broke up.
You wanna dance?
Come on.
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
Any minute, my husband's gonna come through that door.
- Now can we panic?
- Cue dough boy.
I don't care if he's not ready, get him in there now, now, now!
I said, any minute now my husband is going to walk through that door and say...
Where are we?
Derek, darling, what a surprise.
What are you doing here so early?
I don't know.
Sure you do.
You came here to give her something.
Remember?
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry it had to end this way, my dear.
If only my little plot to frame you had worked.
You mean, you killed Carlos?
No, that was me.
That's right, I shot Carlos.
And that's not all.
I'm the one who shot J.R. too.
And I shot the sheriff.
But I did not shoot the deputy.
Do you ever wanna work in this town again?
Painting portraits?
No.
But you see, I'm young and I'm restless.
I only got one life to live so I got to follow my guiding light and search for tomorrow.
Follow him, camera four.
I don't care if he goes to the commissary.
Hey, who knows if I'll wind up living out the days of my life in a mansion in Dallas on the comer of Melrose Place drinking Falcon Crest out of a brown paper bag.
Royce, don't you care about anybody but yourself?
Sure I do.
I care about you.
It's not because of those expensive clothes or your fancy jewelry.
That big Zsa Zsa wig you've be wearing.
I love you for who you are.
Who you really are.
The bald and the beautiful.
Isn't this great?
I told Daddy the soaps aren't predictable.
Got that right.
[JOAN SHRIEKING]
MAN:
Tune in tomorrow for another episode of Now and Forever.
INA:
We're clear.
What the hell do you think you were doing?
I want him fired, Jerry.
Fired!
Now, wait a minute, hey.
If I get fired, you still got to give me mine.
- Ain't that right, C?
CARLTON:
That's right.
I demand you give my client what's coming to him.
Oh, I'd be glad to.
[THUMP]
Sir, this is a letter to Mrs. Banks from him.
Oh, just go for it, sir.
I'll swear it came that way.
- "Dear Vivian... "
- Good Lord.
Oh, I can't believe it either.
He called her "dear. "
- Philip, are you reading my mail?
PHILIP:
Hm?
It didn't come this way.
So now you know.
Philip, I didn't want you to find out this way.
What were you gonna do?
Throw me a surprise party?
No, but I wanted to be with you when you read it.
"To the most important person in my life my beloved husband, Philip whose support and patience have made this book possible.
I love you always, Vivian. "
You dedicated your book to me.
Of course, sweetheart.
Who else was I going to dedicate it to?
Professor Johnson?
That noodle-neck kid stomps on my last nerve.
- I love you.
- Aw.
WILL:
Hey, hey, Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv.
Get a room.
Interesting performance, Master William.
I haven't seen such a disaster on the telly since they cancelled Manimal.
Well, I got paid, didn't I?
I'm gonna just sob all the way to the bank.
You know what I'm saying?
[WILL CARLTON FEIGNS CRYING]
Oh, Will, it's too bad you won't get a chance to work with Halle Barry.
Please tell me you meant Chuck Berry.
Well, it's all here in Soap Opera News.
Apparently you or whatever lucky devil will be playing Royce...
According to this, Royce is moving in with Miss Berry next week.
- Didn't you get your script?
- Ah!
I knew there was something I forgot.
Head start, coming in five, four, three, two...
[WILL SCREAMING]
Don't forget, lab reports by the end of the day.
No extensions, no exceptions.
Any sad stories, you can try.
I'm always up for a laugh.
- Did you do your paper?
- No.
You?
I didn't even know there was one.
- So what do we tell Sorrell?
- The truth.
- That aliens abducted us.
- And ate our papers.
Good.
We've got our stories straight.
No, no, no, no, Tommy.
When I said "no exceptions" I didn't mean you.
You rest that touchdown-throwing arm of yours.
Turn your paper in by the end of football season.
I play basketball, too.
Well, then, just forget about it.
- Hey, Dr. Sorrell...
- No.
You know what?
Why don't I handle this?
Because Dr. Sorrell and I have the kind of close-knit relationship that goes way beyond student-teacher.
I mean, we are very tight.
He didn't even know my name.
- What are you so upset about?
- Oh, I don't know.
Could it be staying up all night to finish my paper?
Could it be breaking into school so my paper's not late?
Or could it be losing half my pants on the barbed wire?
I don't know why you didn't just walk through the gate like I did.
It was too easy.
It looked like a trap.
Come on, let's look over here.
You know what bugs me the most?
Tommy the football hero gets a free ride for throwing a stupid lucky touchdown.
Cory, let me tell you something about breaking and entering.
You usually don't hang around and vent while you're doing it.
He's only fooling himself if he thinks this hero stuff's gonna carry him through life, though.
Oh, yeah.
Troy Aikman's really hurting.
I'm a felon, Hunter.
Don't push me.
All I'm saying is, he's heading for a fall if he believes his own hype.
Come on.
Let's just put our papers on the desk and get out of here.
We are home free.
- Uh-oh.
- Check the batteries.
OK, OK.
But I need a flashlight.
We need matches now.
All right, we're in a chem lab.
There's gotta be matches around here somewhere, right?
Ta-da!
Matches.
As some famous guy once said, "Let there be light."
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Backdraft!
- Oh, my God!
- Was the fire out when you left?
- It's a trash-can fire.
It'll go out by itself.
Or tomorrow, when they take out the trash.
Shawn, Shawn.
It's a chemistry lab.
Chemicals explode.
- Oh, no, this is bad.
- That's what I'm saying.
No, no, no, no.
I ended my paper, "In conclusion, chemicals don't explode."
- Hey, where you going?
- To save the school.
Hey, while you're in there, can you change the ending on my paper?
- (Cory) Shawn, I'm still scared.
- Cory, relax.
We got away with it.
We pulled the alarm, the school didn't burn down, we got our papers in.
And the beauty?
Nobody knows.
Hey, you two.
I know.
- What do you know?
- I know what you did last night.
- You, Curly.
Come with me.
- Shawn?
Quick, rub off your DNA.
This is the guy.
After the fire alarm rang, I saw him running down the hall.
Mr Matthews, is this true?
Well, if he says he saw me, then I guess he saw me.
- All right, Matthews.
Attaboy.
- Attaboy?
You betcha.
I was asleep in my office.
Well, closet.
The alarm woke me up and saved my life.
If it wasn't for your courageous action, today some other janitor would be sweeping me up.
Sounds to me like the little feller's a hero.
Yeah.
It does sound that way, doesn't it, Cory?
Irony.
Well, how fortunate for us that you were passing by the school at that moment.
- Yeah, it was.
- What exactly were you doing out there?
Oh, I don't know.
Just one of those right places at the right time things.
And am I glad he was.
Anybody who saves my life is OK in my book.
You know, Shawn, I'm a little uncomfortable with the whole school thinking I'm a hero.
- You are a hero.
- I don't think so.
Well, whoever laid down this carpet for you sure thinks you are.
Yeah, how do you know they laid it for me?
It leads directly to your locker.
It does.
Ooh.
Plush.
Cory Matthews.
- You know me?
- Do I know you?
Who doesn't?
I graded your paper this morning.
A-plus.
But, sir, it's all burned.
The only thing left is my name and the date.
I saw where you were going.
Keep up the good work.
Oh, and, Hunter?
D.
Chemicals do explode.
- I got an A, Shawn.
- Wow.
A D.
- I'm riding your coattails.
- You know, this doesn't feel right.
Cory, this is exactly what you were talking about yesterday.
Your free ride.
Tommy got lucky with his touchdown and you got lucky with the fire.
- The one I started?
- Nobody knows that.
Come on, you're always saying how you want to be somebody.
Now you are.
- You're a hero.
- I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty.
Go ahead.
Press it.
It's a Locker Genie.
You like it?
And here's an extra clicker for your wife.
- Shawn, do you see this?
- Yeah.
The perks of herodom.
You know, I could get used to this.
You deserve it, Cory.
You saved a man's life.
I did, didn't I?
Click.
And you know what?
I'm glad I did.
Nice guy, that Janitor Bud.
- He deserved to have me save his life.
- You're a hero, aren't you?
You see a burned-down school anywhere?
Hero.
Shawn, there you are.
We gotta meet Cory.
- Where?
- The rally in the caff?
Oh, right.
For the football teams?
No, I hate that stuff.
You know, jocks, guys with tubas.
Cheerleaders.
Come on.
A lot of people think I'm a big deal around here because I throw touchdown passes.
And I am.
But I wouldn't have a field to do it on if it wasn't for this guy.
So this Saturday, we're dedicating our big game to our inspiration, Cory Matthews.
So here to introduce the man of the hour is his brother Eric...
- What's your last name?
- It's Matthews.
- Wow, same as your brother's.
- It's weird, huh?
OK, I'd like to start off with a megabig Patriots hello to all my fellow students.
Specially you, Christine Wingate.
I see you looking at me.
Cory Matthews.
Cory Matthews,
Cory Matthews.
Now, what can I say, except, well...
Last week Stephanie and I broke up, so I am currently single and available.
Call me.
Cory Matthews, a hero.
(chanting) Cory, Cory, Cory.
Thank you, Eric.
Thank you, Tommy.
My fellow heroes.
I've been asked to tell my story, to give the football team a little shot in the arm.
Excuse me, I still have some smoke in my lungs.
Now, you guys are playing this weekend, and you're scared, because the other guys are bigger than you.
Well, last night, my friends, those flames were a lot bigger than me.
- All right!
- Yeah!
- But did I run away?
- (all) No.
That's right, my friends.
Because if you're gonna succeed in business, or on the gridiron, you have got to believe you can do it.
Remember, there's a little Cory Matthews inside each and every one of you.
It's a metaphor.
(chanting) Cory, Cory.
Isn't it great what's happening to Cory?
Everyone loves him.
(chanting) Cory, Cory, Cory, Cory!
This was the greatest day of my life.
Do you think the student council can really do it, Shawn?
- What?
- Get the school named after me.
Cory Adams High.
Look, Cory, I'm glad you're having a free ride and all, but...
What, Shawn?
What?
Well, I just want to make sure you still have your feet on the ground.
You know, it sounds like you're trying to rain on my parade.
Which I believe is on Tuesday.
I'm just saying what you said.
You know, don't buy into your own hype.
Shawn, this is different, all right?
I'm just letting people think what they want to think.
It's not like I'm gonna walk in this door and lie to my parents.
Surprise!
- For me?
- Yes.
There's the man that saved the school.
- Eric told you?
- I didn't have to.
Hey, everybody told us.
That phone hasn't stopped ringing all day.
Well, then, why didn't you just answer it?
So, Cory, tell us everything.
Well, Mom, Dad, I don't know what you guys have exactly heard, but...
Here's what really happened.
I was walking back from Chubbie's when I saw the flames.
I didn't have time to think.
The next thing I know, I'm running into the building... (karate noise)
Shawn, you didn't stay for dinner last night.
Yeah, I wasn't hungry.
Look, I know you're mad at me, and I didn't want to lie to my parents, but I just figured that if I'd told them the truth it would have made things a lot worse, you know?
Sure you're not just getting off on this whole thing?
Shawn, I'm just giving people what they want.
- I mean, I don't want to disappoint them.
- Disappoint them?
Listen to my morning.
Listen to this.
Photo shoot with the homecoming queen.
Sushi with Dr. Sorrell.
Then I gotta fight traffic to greet the new exchange students at the airport.
- I don't know how to make it stop.
- You could just tell them no.
- Well, I'm afraid to do that.
- Why?
'Cause I don't want to go back to being the same old Cory Matthews.
What was wrong with him?
Shawn, I've been at this school for two years, and people still call me Eric's brother, Shawn's friend, or my favorite, "Hey, kid, move."
Cory, aren't you afraid this whole hero thing's getting out of control?
Look, I lied to my school, I lied to my folks.
How much worse can it get, right?
Matthews.
How would you like to tell the rest of Philadelphia what a hero you are?
There's your answer.
Eli called some of his buddies, arranged for an appearance on Philadelphia Tonight.
They want me on TV?
Not just you, they want your whole family.
They'll be at your house tonight.
- Huh?
How great is that?
- Excuse me.
Famous people.
They're all weird.
Come on, Eli.
He's just nervous.
I mean, he can save a guy from a burning building, but he's scared of a little TV camera.
It's almost cute.
That's it, Shawn.
I've reached my limit.
I can't go through with this.
Can't go through with what, Mr. Matthews?
Cory's gonna be on TV.
What on earth for?
They just want him to tell the whole story about the fire.
Oh, wonderful.
I've also been waiting for him to tell the whole story.
Well, Mr. Feeny, I think you pretty much know everything.
Perhaps you're right.
- What did he mean by that?
- Oh, it's Feeny.
Three years and I still don't understand a word he says.
(woman's voice) Hello, you're on the air with Dr. Sharon.
- Hi, Dr. Sharon.
First-time caller.
- And your name is?
Gomez.
And why are you calling this afternoon?
Well, I needed somebody to talk to.
Talk to me, Gomez.
Gomez?
Oh, right.
That's me.
Well, Dr. Sharon, I'm in kind of a bad situation.
See, uh, people think I'm something I'm not, and I want to come clean.
But...
Well, I'm afraid the truth is only gonna make things worse.
So what I'm hearing is, you're in need of a little courage?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
But where do I find that?
I suggest you look deep inside yourself.
I've been on hold for 45 minutes, that's the best you can do?
I have another suggestion.
This evening at 7:30, tune in to "Philadelphia Tonight."
They're doing an inspirational story about a brave boy named Cory Matthews.
Ah, what the heck do you know, lady?
Well, there's no turning back now.
The news van has pulled up.
They're bringing in cameras, cables, lights.
- Ooh.
- What?
Bagels.
You know what, Shawn?
I'm glad you're here with me for this.
Where else would I be, Gomez?
I mean, I'm partly to blame.
I'm the one who told you to ride this whole thing.
So you're gonna go on TV with me?
And lie to the entire city?
What kind of idiot would do something like that?
Half hour to our debut, boys.
Our debut?
Eric, what are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
Rich Herrera.
What?
Rich Herrera.
He's the weather guy on Philly Tonight.
He is such a lame-o.
But when the TV audience gets a load of me, Herrera's out, Matthews is in.
Bet you that's not in his five-day forecast, huh?
Everybody loves Rich Herrera.
Hey, he is nothing but a head of hair and a winning smile.
So.
How do I look?
Head of hair, winning smile.
Yes!
I am so the new weatherman.
Eric, what if this TV thing didn't happen tonight?
What are you saying?
Well, what if I told you that I'm not really a hero?
That I'm the one who started the fire, and this whole thing kinda snowballed.
You're protecting Herrera, aren't you?
Shawn, this is the low point of my life.
I mean, after this I am going straight to hell.
- And you know what the worst part is?
- What?
They'll expect me to put out the fire.
OK, guys.
This is how it's gonna work, OK?
In 30 seconds they're gonna throw it to us, OK?
And then I'm gonna pop you a couple question marks.
You know, we'll talk.
You know, "We love him, we love him, we love him."
OK?
Now, don't hold back on me.
Tears if you got 'em.
OK?
We'll do a commercial, we'll march out the hero, he'll tell his story, flames, flames, flames, flames, flames.
We load up the van and we're drinking by nine.
Well, not the young ones, of course.
- Did you work for her?
- Before she mellowed.
Hello, Connie.
As seen on TV.
Oh, and who is this handsome young man?
Hi, I'm Eric Matthews.
The pleasure's all mine.
Have you been outside today?
With the wind chill factor it's like minus 17 degrees out there.
Brr!
Put on those parkas, Philadelphia.
Oh, yeah, OK.
OK, guys.
Three things to remember.
I want you to smile, have fun, and don't you dare talk over me.
In five, four, three, two...
That's right, Charlie.
We are indeed in the home of Cory Matthews, the courageous young man who saved his school.
- Psst.
- (Connie) And, in the process,
- Hey, you.
Here's what we do.
- ...pulled so-called Janitor Bud...
We switch shirts, you do the interview and I'll hold your sound stick.
It'll be a gas.
Uh, excuse me.
Are you part of this?
Uh, excuse me, yeah.
I helped Cory start the fire.
Later in the program, Cory himself.
But first, his family.
- You must be very proud.
- Oh, yes, we are.
Yeah, he's... he's... he's a great kid.
And how does it feel, knowing that you've raised such a great kid?
It...
Well, Connie, you know, it... it... it's funny.
You, uh, bring this little wrinkled thing home from the hospital, and you never expect that one day...
Uh, you know, Connie, if I may protrude?
Uh, yes.
Eric, the brother.
I like to look at Cory as a coastal eddy.
See, he comes home from school heading east, having gathered strength over the ocean...
Thank you.
I'm going to get right to the point here.
Has being a hero changed Cory?
Well, you know, Connie, I've also got some birthday wishes.
Gorgeous Edna Stein is a hundred years young today.
Happy birthday, Edna.
- Eric, go to your room.
- Uh, Dad, this is live TV.
- I don't care.
- Uh, back to you, Connie.
- Go.
- Ah, those kids.
- He's going.
- You know, you asked, um, if Cory has changed now that he's a hero, and, you know, I don't think so.
- I don't think so.
- That's what's so great about Cory.
He's still the same sweet, wonderful kid he always was.
Well, you have to understand, Connie, that Cory didn't do this to be a hero.
He did this because it... it...
it had to be done.
I mean, for Cory, doing the right thing...
That's what makes him special.
And we'll be right back with Cory Matthews himself, after this weather update from our own Rich Herrera.
(Eric screams)
Hey.
You see these azaleas?
They thrive on sunshine and water.
Not coaxial cables.
And take your generator off my bramble bush.
Ah, Mr. Matthews.
The eyes of Philadelphia are upon you tonight.
- Mr. Feeny, I don't feel so good.
- Preshow jitters?
No, I'm just not comfortable going on TV and being this...
- Hero.
- Hero.
What is that, anyway?
Well, different things to different people, I suppose.
A firefighter can be a hero.
I knew a man who worked in a factory for 30 years at a job he hated.
It was the only way he could support his family.
- I felt that he was a hero.
- Sounds like one to me.
But, to me, a real hero is someone who does the right thing, when the right thing isn't the easy thing to do.
You know, Mr. Feeny, don't you?
You've known all along.
Mr. Matthews, I don't have enough facts to make trouble for anyone, if that's what you mean.
You have an interview to do.
- Cory.
Hey, what are you doing out here?
- They're ready for you.
- Mom, Dad, I don't want to do this.
- Don't want to do what?
Go on lying to you.
Boy, this is hard.
You know that fire I put out?
I also kind of started that fire.
Cory, what are you talking about?
Well, I broke into the chem lab one night to turn in a late paper.
I mean I'm no hero, I'm just bad with matches.
- You started that fire?
- It was an accident.
And you went on letting people assume you were a hero?
What were you thinking?
I was thinking I wanted to be somebody I wasn't.
And I know, I know that was a mistake.
But the bigger mistake was not telling you guys the truth.
Well, Cory, you've made a lot of mistakes here.
Well, I just kept on hoping it would go away, so that I wouldn't get in trouble.
Well, it didn't, and you are.
So now what?
Now we go inside and we tell Connie that you're not going on TV.
And by "we," I mean "you."
- She's gonna freak on me.
- Well, she'll just have to get in line.
Mr. Matthews?
Well done.
Your story confirmed what I suspected all along.
So you did know.
No, no.
No.
I just knew the character of the young man.
The character?
Heroic.
Oh, by the way, I'll see you at school tomorrow.
- But tomorrow's Saturday.
- Yes, I know.
Bring old clothes.
You'll be painting.
Janitor Bud, how can you take away his Locker Genie?
- I mean, he still saved your life.
- OK.
I owe you my life.
But Feeny signs the checks.
Clicker.
Mrs. Fraud?
Well, so much for the perks.
Come on, Cory.
Would you rather go back to being a hero again?
Nah.
I'm happy just being plain old Cory.
I mean, look.
I got my best friend, I got my girlfriend...
Hey, kid.
Move.
And I got my old name back.
Hey, Dr. Sorrell.
I got practice tomorrow, and do you think...
Oh, sure, Tommy.
Miss the lab.
Take all the time you need.
Oh, Dr. Sorrell.
Hey.
Um, listen.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow, and here's a note from my mom.
Tell someone who cares.
It's good to be me.
Captain's Log, Stardate 48532.4.
We're on our way to a rogue planetoid which Mr. Neelix tells us is an extremely rich source of raw dilithium.
If he's right, this could go a long way toward easing our power shortage.
Assuming we do find dilithium on this planetoid, we're going to need a refining facility on the ship to process it.
Lieutenant Torres has already asked permission to start modifications to the auxiliary impulse reactor.
It could be converted into a crude dilithium refinery.
The impulse reactor?
Sometimes I think B'Elanna goes out of her way to find solutions that ignore Starfleet procedures.
Her arguments are quite convincing.
She thinks it can be done safely.
I'm sure it can.
Tell her I want regular reports on her progress every step of the way.
Are you sure you won't join me for breakfast?
I was thinking of having eggs Benedict with asparagus, strawberries and cream... I said I was thinking about it.
I'm actually having ration pack #5-- stewed tomatoes with dehydrated eggs.
Mmm, sounds delicious, but I've already had my vacuum-packed oatmeal this morning.
I'll see you on the Bridge.
Here you are.
Hope you enjoy it.
What is going on here?
Captain, you caught me by surprise.
I could say the same thing.
What are you doing?
I know how you and the other, uh, senior officers have been-- excuse me-- disappointed with the rations lately, so I thought I'd use a few of the vegetables from the hydroponics bay and whip up a... ooh, a little breakfast.
You have turned this into a Galley?
It wasn't easy.
I had to completely reroute the Mess Hall power conduits and scrounge a lot of supplies from all over the ship, but that's my specialty-- making something out of nothing.
I know it doesn't look like much now, but in a few days, you'll swear there'd been a Galley here for years.
Careful.
That one is a little spicy.
Neelix... who approved this?
Uh, well... no one.
Well, you might have asked me first.
This used to be my private dining room.
Your, your dining room?
If you had checked the ship's directory, you'd have noticed that Cabin 125-Alpha, Deck 2, is designated as the Captain's Private Dining Room.
Oh... oh, ah, then I guess that you'll be wanting me to move all of this stuff out of your way?
Bridge to Captain Janeway.
Go ahead.
We're approaching the rogue planetoid, Captain.
On my way.
I want you to come with me.
We will deal with this later.
Ensign Parsons, would you mind keeping an eye on things until I get back... and, uh, rotate the darvot fritters every ten minutes until they turn a deep chartreuse.
And remember-- one, one to a customer.
What have you found?
We're picking up definite dilithium signatures, Captain.
The strongest readings are originating from ten to 20 kilometers inside the planetoid.
It also looks like there's a series of subterranean caves with an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
Class-M.
It'll make mining a lot easier if we can go in there without environmental suits.
How much dilithium are we talking about?
It's hard to get a precise reading.
It could be anywhere from 500 to... 1,000 metric tons.
Just as I said.
I bet there are few Yallitian engineers who'd give all three of their spinal columns to know where this planet is.
Commander, take an away team down into those caves and do a preliminary geological analysis.
Lieutenant, you'd better get your dilithium refinery on line.
It'll be ready to go in three days.
Ensign Kim.
Where are you going?
With you.
I've been studying my Tricorder Operations Manual.
Lieutenant Torres has brought me up-to-date on dilithium geophysics.
I've been preparing for this mission all week.
Very well, Mr. Neelix.
I think you'll find me extremely helpful, Commander.
I remember the first time that I flew past this planet.
It was about three years ago...
Deck 4.
Looks like there are several large deposits in this general vicinity.
Let's split up and begin taking geological scans.
Keep your com channels open at all times and don't wander too far.
Stay within a 50-meter radius of this position.
Chakotay to Kim.
Go ahead.
I'm still picking up dilithium signatures... but there are no dilithium formations here.
Have you found anything yet?
I'm running a geo-stratal analysis of the rock in this vicinity.
But so far, there's no indication of any dilithium.
Keep looking.
Neelix to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead.
I think I found something-- a large cavern approximately 20 meters from my position.
I'm reading a huge dilithium formation there.
Don't go any further, Neelix.
Stay within the search radius.
I'll be with you in a minute.
But it's right here!
I'm in the cavern now, Commander, but... I don't understand this.
Let me guess-- nothing there?
Not so much as a sliver of dilithium.
And yet, according to my readings, I should be surrounded by it.
All right, I've had enough of this.
Kim, Neelix, we're heading back to the ship.
Rendezvous with the...
Wait a minute.
I'm getting unusual readings from this rock face.
Traces of organic energy.
Looks like a bioelectrical signature.
I think there's something alive down here.
It's about... two meters into this rock face.
Neelix, I said get back here.
Neelix, did you hear what I said?
Just one minute, Commander.
Hello?
is there someone there?
Hello?
I know there's somebody...
Neelix, what's wrong?
Neelix!
Kim!
I'm on my way, sir.
I can't be sure, but I think he's going into shock.
Chakotay to Voyager-- medical emergency.
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.
Get the blood-gas infuser.
The what?
Equipment Storage Unit 2, second shelf on the left, now.
Hold him still.
What's happening, Doctor?
He's going into a coma.
The infuser will keep his oxygen level stable for the next hour or so, but after that, he'll die.
His lungs have been removed.
By the time we got to him, he was unconscious.
How could anyone remove his organs so quickly?
The doctor says whoever did this used some kind of transporter to beam the lungs directly out of his body.
What happened?
It appears that Neelix was attacked.
We don't know how it happened, but someone has surgically removed his lungs.
Did you find any evidence of the life sign that Neelix reported?
No.
Captain, I've analyzed the sensor logs from Neelix's tricorder.
The bio-scanner picked up a single class-3 humanoid organism.
The blood-gas infuser will keep him alive for another 47 minutes.
The only chance for his survival I see at the moment is to get his own lungs back.
Can't we fit him with a pair of artificial lungs?
His respiratory system is directly linked to multiple points along his spinal column.
It's too complex to replicate.
I may be able to surgically reattach the organs if we get them back.
In the meantime, I'll have to search for other options.
Commander, I'm taking an away team back to the planet.
You're in charge until we return.
Inform Mr. Tuvok I want three armed security detachments to accompany us.
Issue type-3 phasers.
Mr. Paris, did they teach you how to run a respiratory series in your biochemistry classes at the Academy?
No, I'm afraid they didn't.
Fine. I'll run it myself.
Get me a pulmonary scanner.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I'm not leaving.
All right, just keep out of the way.
Here it is.
This is where Neelix was standing when he was attacked.
According to his tricorder log, he was scanning this rock face when he detected the life sign.
Neelix said there was a life sign two meters behind this wall, but my tricorder says there's nothing but solid rock for another 15 meters.
It sounds like our tricorders aren't giving us the real picture behind what's going on here.
Wait a minute.
The rock is warmer here.
You're right, Captain.
There's a two-degree differential in this section of the wall.
There are no natural geological phenomena that could be creating this heat source.
Let's make a little heat of our own.
There was a highly sophisticated force field in place.
There's a chamber down this corridor.
Doc, I think his cellular toxicity level is rising.
It's up to 32 percent.
Let's see if we can stabilize those levels.
Get me a cytoplasmic stimulator.
Ah, we don't have one.
Then replicate one.
Yeah.
The design schematics are in the ship's medical data base.
Right.
The man drives a 700,000-ton starship so somebody thinks he'd make a good medic.
I can survive with one lung, can't I?
What if I donated a lung to Neelix?
A transplant is not an option.
No one aboard is a compatible match for a Talaxian.
We're going to need a completely new way to oxygenate his blood supply and relay neuro-electrical impulses.
Our replicators can't produce compatible artificial organs for him, but maybe there's a way to mimic their functions and give us direct control of his respiratory system.
Computer, is there an identification matrix on Mr. Neelix from the last time he used the transporter?
Affirmative.
Transfer it to console 4.
What are you doing?
I'm using the transporter matrix to get exact specifications for Neelix's lungs.
I thought you just said we can't replicate his lungs.
We can't, but if I can reconfigure my emitter array, I might be able to create a pair of holographic lungs for Mr. Neelix.
Holographic lungs?
If it's successful, we can precisely control his pulmonary functions to allow normal breathing.
But a hologram is just a projection of light held in a magnetic containment field.
There's no real matter involved.
Now... you hit me.
The magnetic containment field that creates the illusion of my body can be modulated to allow matter to pass through it or... be stopped.
I might be able to modulate the holographic lungs in the same way, allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass from the lungs to the bloodstream.
I want to know what this means.
What are you going to do to him?
There's no time to explain the exact procedure to you right now.
Oh, well, make the time, because I'm not going to let you perform any experimental surgery on Neelix until I know exactly what you're doing and what the risks are.
The risk is that it won't work.
And if it doesn't, he'll die.
But it is his only immediate chance for survival.
If he does survive, he'll have to be held motionless in an isotropic restraint.
The lungs need to be perfectly aligned to his internal physiology.
The computer won't be able to compensate for any body movement whatsoever.
How long will he have to stay like that?
For the rest of his life, unless the holo-lungs can be replaced by his original organs, and he will never be able to leave the holographic environment of this room.
The holo-lungs would disappear the moment he went out the door.
Kes, I know it sounds pretty grim, but it's better than losing him completely.
This way, he'll still be alive.
And maybe we can find a better solution somewhere down the road.
What do you think Neelix would want?
I'm not sure.
But I do know that I want him to live.
This room is the source of the dilithium signature we detected earlier.
The power systems here are running on an unusual dilithium matrix.
So there are actually no dilithium deposits on this planet?
It would appear not.
Are these organs?
This looks like some kind of storage facility.
I would say you are correct, Captain.
This appears to be a biological repository.
Any sign of Neelix's lungs?
Negative.
There is, however, a Kazon liver, and although I cannot identify the other organs on display here, I would say they bear a striking similarity to pulmonary organs, epidermal tissue, ocular nerve fiber...
Save the cataloging for later, Tuvok.
According to my tricorder, there was a life form in this room less than ten minutes ago.
Captain.
Open it.
One life sign 20 meters ahead.
Let's go.
They've erected a force field with a rotating phase modulation.
We will not be able to disrupt it.
Voyager to Captain Janeway.
Go ahead.
We've just picked up an alien ship leaving the planet.
Tractor them, Commander.
Sorry, Captain.
They went into warp too quickly.
Beam us back.
As soon as we're aboard, lay in a course for pursuit, maximum warp.
Aye, Captain.
Okay... the isotropic restraint is activated.
He won't be able to move more than two microns in any direction.
One micron would be preferable, but I suppose it'll have to do.
lnitiating the holographic emitter array.
His cellular toxicity is rising.
82 percent.
86 percent.
Computer, activate program Neelix-1.
Deactivate the infuser.
It's off-line.
Here we go.
90 percent.
95 percent.
Toxicity returning to normal.
Captain's Log, supplemental.
We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon.
They are not responding to hails, and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed.
Holographic lungs?
Yes.
And they're working perfectly, if I do say so myself.
Try to breathe normally.
How long can I live like this?
I don't know.
This is an unprecedented medical procedure.
We will be closely monitoring your condition.
When do I get out of this restraint?
Unless Captain Janeway is successful in retrieving your original lungs, you'll have to stay in the isotropic restraint indefinitely.
indefinitely?
You mean I... I could be in here the rest of my life?
Yes.
But we're trying to find the aliens that did this to you.
The Captain is doing everything she can.
Well... if I'm going to be in here a while, now's as good a time as any to tell you.
Your ceiling is hideous.
I didn't design the room.
I just work here.
Something with a bit of color would help.
Maybe a nice tapestry or a painting.
Uh, could you dim the lights a little?
I'm a doctor, Mr. Neelix, not a decorator.
Perhaps you would be willing to accommodate his... aesthetic needs.
And some music would be nice.
Or better yet, are you programmed to sing?
Janeway to Paris.
Please report to the Bridge.
I'm on my way, Captain.
You know where l am if you need me.
Thanks for everything.
Oh, fine.
I have a little accident, I lose a pair of lungs, and the next thing I know
Paris is swooping in like a Rectilian vulture.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you hear the way that he said that?
"l'll be on the Bridge if you need me."
"lf you need me."
Neelix...
Why doesn't he just pull the plug on the holographic emitter, and get it over with, get me out of the way, so he can have you all to himself?
Neelix, you're overreacting.
Tom's been very supportive.
Ah, so it's "Tom" now, is it?
You really have nothing to worry about.
We're friends, that's all.
It's not you I'm worried about.
It's him.
He's just... one big hormone walking around the ship.
Don't you see the way that he looks at you?
This is ridiculous.
I am not going to argue with you about something that exists only in your imagination.
I know you, Neelix.
And I know you're afraid.
I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I'll be here with you.
Ke...
Kes... I could be in here a very long time.
You need to go on with your life.
Don't worry about me.
Neelix...
You should just let me die.
Stop that.
We're going to get through this together.
Visiting hours are over.
He needs rest.
When can I come back?
1700 hours, not a minute before.
I'll see you then.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kiss you.
I'm only adjusting the restraint.
I'll try to contain my disappointment.
Captain, we've completed our diagnostic on the alien device.
It appears to be more than a weapon.
It's also a very sophisticated medical scanner and surgical instrument.
From what we can tell, lt uses a neural resonator to stun the victim while a quantum imaging scanner begins a microcellular analysis of the entire body.
The amount of information this thing can gather puts a tricorder to shame.
You fire this at someone, you learn everything about their anatomy, right down to their DNA sequencing.
So it sounds like we're dealing with aliens who've developed a technology specifically designed to locate and extract organs from other beings.
Why?
Captain.
The alien ship has dropped out of warp.
It's approaching a large asteroid.
On screen.
It's entered the asteroid, Captain.
Hold position here.
Mr. Kim?
I can't scan the interior.
The surface stratum is made up of some sort of neutronium alloy.
It doesn't look like a natural formation.
Are you saying someone built this asteroid?
It's possible.
Any sign of weapons or defense systems?
Negative.
I think I've located where the alien ship entered.
There's an open crater on the limb of the asteroid.
Let's see it.
The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside.
How large is that crater?
200 meters in diameter.
Captain, may I suggest you consider carefully what you are about to do.
How do you know what I'm about to do?
I could describe to you in detail the psychological observations I've made about you over the past four years, which lead me to conclude you're about to take this ship inside the asteroid, but suffice it to say
I know you quite well.
One of these days, I'm going to surprise you, Tuvok, but not today.
I've already considered other options.
If Neelix has any chance of surviving, we have to act fast.
Red Alert.
Mr. Paris, lay in a course.
Aye, Captain.
Mr. Tuvok, maximum shields.
Phasers at the ready.
Captain, I'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only.
This passageway is getting a little too narrow for my taste.
Use your discretion, Mr. Paris.
Any sign of the vessel, Lieutenant?
We're still following the ion trail, but electromagnetic interference is limiting our sensor range.
I'm only able to scan 500 meters ahead of us.
Are there any indications we're being scanned or probed, Mr. Kim?
Not yet.
Doctor?
Doctor, I require your assistance.
What is it, Mr. Neelix?
Please, it's urgent.
Yes?
I have an itch.
An itch?
Just above my left eyebrow.
A little higher.
Oh, thank you.
You're quite welcome.
Doctor, wait, don't leave.
I'm not leaving, Mr. Neelix.
I'm simply going back to work.
I can't see you over there.
I...
I feel like I'm all alone.
You are all alone.
I'm a holographic projection-- a projection with a lot of work to do, I might add.
That's very amusing, Doctor.
But... um... I'm really starting to feel a little, uh... trapped in here.
A little claustrophobic maybe.
I'm not sure what to do.
There's nothing you can do except lie there and be quiet.
I'm going to lie here for the rest of my life, aren't I?
Just staring up at the ceiling.
I'm not sure I can take that.
I really need to get out of this restraint.
Doctor, I want you to let me out of this thing right now.
You know that's impossible.
I'm the patient.
I know what my rights are.
I want to be released from this restraint immediately.
lmmediately!
Mr. Neelix, you are alive, you are breathing and for the moment, your condition is stable.
That is more than most people can say in your situation.
Now, it is critical to your recovery that you not subject yourself to any additional stress.
Try to calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You're not the one trapped in a restraining field with holo-lungs.
I don't think they're working.
I can't...
I can't get enough oxygen.
There's something wrong.
You're hyperventilating.
Try to take slow, natural breaths.
I can't.
I'm dying.
Let me out of here.
Will you help me?
Help me.
Help me!
You're doing just fine, Mr. Paris.
Just fine.
Thanks, Captain.
Sensors detect a large chamber ahead.
What the hell?
We appear to be seeing Voyager and the alien ship reflecting off the walls of the chamber.
Can you determine which ship is the real one?
No, Captain.
The walls are emanating severe electromagnetic interference.
I cannot scan them directly.
It's like trying to move through a hall of mirrors.
You never know when you're going to walk into the glass.
I'm still picking up the alien's ion trail.
Maybe we should follow that.
They might have left a fake ion trail to lure us in here.
It could lead us right into one of those walls.
That's a chance we're going to have to take.
Tuvok, extend the deflectors to maximum range.
If we do run into something, it'll give us an extra margin of error.
Follow the ion trail, Mr. Paris, slowly.
Mr. Kim, continuous scans.
Aye, Captain.
I'll do what I can to reassure him, Doctor.
Good. lf you don't mind, I'd like you to remain in Sick Bay, so you're here when he wakes up.
Of course.
Are you all right?
Me?
You seem agitated about something.
Of course I'm agitated.
This entire situation is getting out of control.
You mean Neelix.
First they tell me there's no doctor, so I have to be on call 24 hours a day.
And then they tell me there are no nurses, so I have no one to assist me.
I thought Tom Paris was assigned to you.
Like I said, no one to assist me, and now I have a patient with severe and possibly long-term emotional problems and there's no Counselor on board.
I am an emergency medical supplement-- a supplement, that's all.
I wasn't programmed for any of this.
It's just... unacceptable.
I don't know anything about holographic engineering, but if you want my opinion, you haven't been acceptable.
You've been remarkable.
I've only done what the program allows me to.
Give yourself some credit.
You saved his life.
You did-- not some program.
It may seem that way to you.
That's exactly how it seems.
You're very... kind.
How does a real doctor learn to deal with patients' emotional problems, anyway?
They learn from experience.
Aren't you capable of learning?
I have the capacity to accumulate and process data, yes.
Then I guess you'll just have to learn... like the rest of us.
Have you ever considered a career in medicine?
Neelix is starting to regain consciousness.
Lieutenant, I'm picking up a minor power fluctuation in the warp core.
Compensate with the KLS stabilizer.
No effect.
In fact, the power loss is starting to accelerate.
Janeway to Torres.
What's going on down there?
Some kind of power drain.
I can't localize it, but... we're losing power at a rate of seven percent per minute.
The power drain is coming from somewhere in this chamber, Captain.
Some kind of dampening field.
It's bleeding energy directly from the warp nacelles.
B'Elanna, shut down the warp core.
Go to emergency power.
No effect, Captain.
Keep me informed.
Bridge out.
Can you pinpoint the source of the dampening field?
It appears to be coming from 217 mark 015.
Distance 547 meters.
Tuvok.
What would happen if we locked phasers and fired at the source?
The walls of this chamber reflect directed energy.
The phaser beam would ricochet along an unpredictable path, possibly impacting our ship in the process.
All right.
We won't try that.
Well, maybe we should.
Tuvok, what would happen if we reduced the phaser power level to a minimum setting and sent out a continuous beam?
The phaser would continue to reflect off the bulkheads until it encountered a nonreflective material.
Until it encountered a nonreflective material-- like the real alien ship.
So we could use the phasers like a searchlight... scan the interior of the station until we find the ship.
Exactly.
Do it.
Adjusting phaser azimuth to 15 degrees.
Wait a minute.
I think I've found the real ship.
On screen.
Mr. Paris, bring us within transporter range of that ship.
Aye, Captain.
I'm picking up two life signs.
They're powering engines.
Bridge to Transporter Room 3.
Lock on to those two life signs and beam them aboard.
Security, meet me in Transporter Room 3.
Aye, sir.
You're on the Starship Voyager.
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the United Federation of Planets.
I am Dereth... of the Vidiian Sodality.
You attacked one of our crew members and you lured us into this asteroid.
Why?
We are gathering replacement organs and suitable biomatter.
It is the only way we have to fight the phage.
A virus?
Some kind of disease?
Yes.
It attacked our people over two millennia ago.
It consumes our bodies destroys our genetic codes and cellular structures.
So you harvest the bodies of other beings to replace your own tissues as they're consumed by this... phage?
Our immunotechnology cannot keep up.
The phage adapts.
It resists all attempts to destroy it.
Our society has been ravaged.
Thousands die each day.
There is no other way for us to survive.
I have a great... sympathy for what your race has endured.
But I cannot allow you to keep the organs you removed from one of our crew members.
We need them back immediately.
I'm afraid that isn't possible.
I have already biochemically altered the air-breathing organs and grafted them into Motura's body.
They are a part of him now.
He is my honatta.
His task is to find the organs I need for survival.
We... we try to extract them from the dead...
But sometimes, when the need is immediate more aggressive actions are required.
So now I am left with the same choice you made-- whether to commit murder to save a life, or to allow my own crewman to die while you breathe air through his lungs.
It must be impossible for you to understand how any civilized people could come to... this.
Before the phage began, we were known as educators and explorers-- a people whose greatest achievements were artistic.
I, myself, am a sculptor of note on my world.
All I can say is that when your entire existence is at stake...
You don't have to explain yourself, Motura.
If the consequence of this act is a death sentence, so be it.
At least it will put an end to my suffering.
I can't begin to understand what your people have gone through.
They may have found a way to ignore the moral implications of what you're doing, but I have no such luxury.
I don't have the freedom to kill you to save another.
My culture finds that to be a reprehensible and entirely unacceptable act.
If we were closer to home, I would lock you up and turn you over to my authorities for trial but I don't even have that ability here, and I am not prepared to carry you forever in our brig.
So I see no other alternative... but to let you go.
Take a message to your people.
If I ever encounter your kind again, I will do whatever is necessary to protect my people from this...
harvesting of yours.
Any aggressive actions against this ship or its crew will be met by the deadliest force.
is that clear?
Uh... quite.
Wait.
I want to see this crewman of yours.
That can serve no useful purpose.
Maybe it can.
Our medical technologies may be superior to theirs.
I can tell you, from what we've observed of them, that they are considerably superior.
She spared my life-- our lives.
We owe it to them to see if there's anything we can do to help him.
I'll take you to him.
His simulated organs are primitive.
It's amazing he is still alive.
This is set to scan only.
Proceed... carefully.
Strange.
According to my readings, you are not here.
Believe me, I wish I weren't.
The rest of you are healthy.
You are compatible for organ transplant.
Wait a minute.
We've already considered this.
Talaxian physiology is different from that of anyone else on this ship.
His immune system would reject their lungs immediately.
Your surgical knowledge is inferior.
We will simply adapt his immunogenicity.
It won't be a problem.
Which of you will donate a lung?
Me.
No!
Absolutely not.
It's too dangerous.
Let someone else do it.
No, I want to do it, Neelix.
I'm willing to take the risk.
Besides, you've done so much for me.
Let me give you something once.
Just for once.
All right.
I look forward to sampling your cooking, Mr. Neelix.
You mean I can keep my kitchen?
Well, at least until we get the replicators back on line.
Thank you, Captain.
And, Captain... I'll see you at breakfast.
Captain's Log, supplemental.
The aliens have successfully transplanted one of Kes's lungs into Neelix.
The dampening field has been deactivated, and I have allowed them to beam back to their vessel.
We are resuming a course home.
It's all right.
The operation was a success.
Neelix is asleep and breathing on his own now... with your lung.
I feel a little light-headed.
That will pass.
You'll soon adapt to diminished lung capacity.
I spoke to the Captain about you.
She's given me permission to begin training you as a medical assistant.
You'll be a backup for Mr. Paris or, possibly, a replacement.
That is, assuming you're interested.
Of course I'm interested.
When do we start?
We'll begin your lessons as soon as you've fully recovered.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
You've... given me a lot to think about.
Captain's Log, Stardate 48532.4.
We're on our way to a rogue planetoid which Mr. Neelix tells us is an extremely rich source of raw dilithium.
If he's right, this could go a long way toward easing our power shortage.
Assuming we do find dilithium on this planetoid, we're going to need a refining facility on the ship to process it.
Lieutenant Torres has already asked permission to start modifications to the auxiliary impulse reactor.
It could be converted into a crude dilithium refinery.
The impulse reactor?
Sometimes I think B'Elanna goes out of her way to find solutions that ignore Starfleet procedures.
Her arguments are quite convincing.
She thinks it can be done safely.
I'm sure it can.
Tell her I want regular reports on her progress every step of the way.
Are you sure you won't join me for breakfast?
I was thinking of having eggs Benedict with asparagus, strawberries and cream... I said I was thinking about it.
I'm actually having ration pack #5-- stewed tomatoes with dehydrated eggs.
Mmm, sounds delicious, but I've already had my vacuum-packed oatmeal this morning.
I'll see you on the Bridge.
Here you are.
Hope you enjoy it.
What is going on here?
Captain, you caught me by surprise.
I could say the same thing.
What are you doing?
I know how you and the other, uh, senior officers have been-- excuse me-- disappointed with the rations lately, so I thought I'd use a few of the vegetables from the hydroponics bay and whip up a... ooh, a little breakfast.
You have turned this into a Galley?
It wasn't easy.
I had to completely reroute the Mess Hall power conduits and scrounge a lot of supplies from all over the ship, but that's my specialty-- making something out of nothing.
I know it doesn't look like much now, but in a few days, you'll swear there'd been a Galley here for years.
Careful.
That one is a little spicy.
Neelix... who approved this?
Uh, well... no one.
Well, you might have asked me first.
This used to be my private dining room.
Your, your dining room?
If you had checked the ship's directory, you'd have noticed that Cabin 125-Alpha, Deck 2, is designated as the Captain's Private Dining Room.
Oh... oh, ah, then I guess that you'll be wanting me to move all of this stuff out of your way?
Bridge to Captain Janeway.
Go ahead.
We're approaching the rogue planetoid, Captain.
On my way.
I want you to come with me.
We will deal with this later.
Ensign Parsons, would you mind keeping an eye on things until I get back... and, uh, rotate the darvot fritters every ten minutes until they turn a deep chartreuse.
And remember-- one, one to a customer.
What have you found?
We're picking up definite dilithium signatures, Captain.
The strongest readings are originating from ten to 20 kilometers inside the planetoid.
It also looks like there's a series of subterranean caves with an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
Class-M.
It'll make mining a lot easier if we can go in there without environmental suits.
How much dilithium are we talking about?
It's hard to get a precise reading.
It could be anywhere from 500 to... 1,000 metric tons.
Just as I said.
I bet there are few Yallitian engineers who'd give all three of their spinal columns to know where this planet is.
Commander, take an away team down into those caves and do a preliminary geological analysis.
Lieutenant, you'd better get your dilithium refinery on line.
It'll be ready to go in three days.
Ensign Kim.
Where are you going?
With you.
I've been studying my Tricorder Operations Manual.
Lieutenant Torres has brought me up-to-date on dilithium geophysics.
I've been preparing for this mission all week.
Very well, Mr. Neelix.
I think you'll find me extremely helpful, Commander.
I remember the first time that I flew past this planet.
It was about three years ago...
Deck 4.
Looks like there are several large deposits in this general vicinity.
Let's split up and begin taking geological scans.
Keep your com channels open at all times and don't wander too far.
Stay within a 50-meter radius of this position.
Chakotay to Kim.
Go ahead.
I'm still picking up dilithium signatures... but there are no dilithium formations here.
Have you found anything yet?
I'm running a geo-stratal analysis of the rock in this vicinity.
But so far, there's no indication of any dilithium.
Keep looking.
Neelix to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead.
I think I found something-- a large cavern approximately 20 meters from my position.
I'm reading a huge dilithium formation there.
Don't go any further, Neelix.
Stay within the search radius.
I'll be with you in a minute.
But it's right here!
I'm in the cavern now, Commander, but... I don't understand this.
Let me guess-- nothing there?
Not so much as a sliver of dilithium.
And yet, according to my readings, I should be surrounded by it.
All right, I've had enough of this.
Kim, Neelix, we're heading back to the ship.
Rendezvous with the...
Wait a minute.
I'm getting unusual readings from this rock face.
Traces of organic energy.
Looks like a bioelectrical signature.
I think there's something alive down here.
It's about... two meters into this rock face.
Neelix, I said get back here.
Neelix, did you hear what I said?
Just one minute, Commander.
Hello?
is there someone there?
Hello?
I know there's somebody...
Neelix, what's wrong?
Neelix!
Kim!
I'm on my way, sir.
I can't be sure, but I think he's going into shock.
Chakotay to Voyager-- medical emergency.
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.
Get the blood-gas infuser.
The what?
Equipment Storage Unit 2, second shelf on the left, now.
Hold him still.
What's happening, Doctor?
He's going into a coma.
The infuser will keep his oxygen level stable for the next hour or so, but after that, he'll die.
His lungs have been removed.
By the time we got to him, he was unconscious.
How could anyone remove his organs so quickly?
The doctor says whoever did this used some kind of transporter to beam the lungs directly out of his body.
What happened?
It appears that Neelix was attacked.
We don't know how it happened, but someone has surgically removed his lungs.
Did you find any evidence of the life sign that Neelix reported?
No.
Captain, I've analyzed the sensor logs from Neelix's tricorder.
The bio-scanner picked up a single class-3 humanoid organism.
The blood-gas infuser will keep him alive for another 47 minutes.
The only chance for his survival I see at the moment is to get his own lungs back.
Can't we fit him with a pair of artificial lungs?
His respiratory system is directly linked to multiple points along his spinal column.
It's too complex to replicate.
I may be able to surgically reattach the organs if we get them back.
In the meantime, I'll have to search for other options.
Commander, I'm taking an away team back to the planet.
You're in charge until we return.
Inform Mr. Tuvok I want three armed security detachments to accompany us.
Issue type-3 phasers.
Mr. Paris, did they teach you how to run a respiratory series in your biochemistry classes at the Academy?
No, I'm afraid they didn't.
Fine. I'll run it myself.
Get me a pulmonary scanner.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I'm not leaving.
All right, just keep out of the way.
Here it is.
This is where Neelix was standing when he was attacked.
According to his tricorder log, he was scanning this rock face when he detected the life sign.
Neelix said there was a life sign two meters behind this wall, but my tricorder says there's nothing but solid rock for another 15 meters.
It sounds like our tricorders aren't giving us the real picture behind what's going on here.
Wait a minute.
The rock is warmer here.
You're right, Captain.
There's a two-degree differential in this section of the wall.
There are no natural geological phenomena that could be creating this heat source.
Let's make a little heat of our own.
There was a highly sophisticated force field in place.
There's a chamber down this corridor.
Doc, I think his cellular toxicity level is rising.
It's up to 32 percent.
Let's see if we can stabilize those levels.
Get me a cytoplasmic stimulator.
Ah, we don't have one.
Then replicate one.
Yeah.
The design schematics are in the ship's medical data base.
Right.
The man drives a 700,000-ton starship so somebody thinks he'd make a good medic.
I can survive with one lung, can't I?
What if I donated a lung to Neelix?
A transplant is not an option.
No one aboard is a compatible match for a Talaxian.
We're going to need a completely new way to oxygenate his blood supply and relay neuro-electrical impulses.
Our replicators can't produce compatible artificial organs for him, but maybe there's a way to mimic their functions and give us direct control of his respiratory system.
Computer, is there an identification matrix on Mr. Neelix from the last time he used the transporter?
Affirmative.
Transfer it to console 4.
What are you doing?
I'm using the transporter matrix to get exact specifications for Neelix's lungs.
I thought you just said we can't replicate his lungs.
We can't, but if I can reconfigure my emitter array, I might be able to create a pair of holographic lungs for Mr. Neelix.
Holographic lungs?
If it's successful, we can precisely control his pulmonary functions to allow normal breathing.
But a hologram is just a projection of light held in a magnetic containment field.
There's no real matter involved.
Now... you hit me.
The magnetic containment field that creates the illusion of my body can be modulated to allow matter to pass through it or... be stopped.
I might be able to modulate the holographic lungs in the same way, allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass from the lungs to the bloodstream.
I want to know what this means.
What are you going to do to him?
There's no time to explain the exact procedure to you right now.
Oh, well, make the time, because I'm not going to let you perform any experimental surgery on Neelix until I know exactly what you're doing and what the risks are.
The risk is that it won't work.
And if it doesn't, he'll die.
But it is his only immediate chance for survival.
If he does survive, he'll have to be held motionless in an isotropic restraint.
The lungs need to be perfectly aligned to his internal physiology.
The computer won't be able to compensate for any body movement whatsoever.
How long will he have to stay like that?
For the rest of his life, unless the holo-lungs can be replaced by his original organs, and he will never be able to leave the holographic environment of this room.
The holo-lungs would disappear the moment he went out the door.
Kes, I know it sounds pretty grim, but it's better than losing him completely.
This way, he'll still be alive.
And maybe we can find a better solution somewhere down the road.
What do you think Neelix would want?
I'm not sure.
But I do know that I want him to live.
This room is the source of the dilithium signature we detected earlier.
The power systems here are running on an unusual dilithium matrix.
So there are actually no dilithium deposits on this planet?
It would appear not.
Are these organs?
This looks like some kind of storage facility.
I would say you are correct, Captain.
This appears to be a biological repository.
Any sign of Neelix's lungs?
Negative.
There is, however, a Kazon liver, and although I cannot identify the other organs on display here, I would say they bear a striking similarity to pulmonary organs, epidermal tissue, ocular nerve fiber...
Save the cataloging for later, Tuvok.
According to my tricorder, there was a life form in this room less than ten minutes ago.
Captain.
Open it.
One life sign 20 meters ahead.
Let's go.
They've erected a force field with a rotating phase modulation.
We will not be able to disrupt it.
Voyager to Captain Janeway.
Go ahead.
We've just picked up an alien ship leaving the planet.
Tractor them, Commander.
Sorry, Captain.
They went into warp too quickly.
Beam us back.
As soon as we're aboard, lay in a course for pursuit, maximum warp.
Aye, Captain.
Okay... the isotropic restraint is activated.
He won't be able to move more than two microns in any direction.
One micron would be preferable, but I suppose it'll have to do.
lnitiating the holographic emitter array.
His cellular toxicity is rising.
82 percent.
86 percent.
Computer, activate program Neelix-1.
Deactivate the infuser.
It's off-line.
Here we go.
90 percent.
95 percent.
Toxicity returning to normal.
Captain's Log, supplemental.
We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon.
They are not responding to hails, and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed.
Holographic lungs?
Yes.
And they're working perfectly, if I do say so myself.
Try to breathe normally.
How long can I live like this?
I don't know.
This is an unprecedented medical procedure.
We will be closely monitoring your condition.
When do I get out of this restraint?
Unless Captain Janeway is successful in retrieving your original lungs, you'll have to stay in the isotropic restraint indefinitely.
indefinitely?
You mean I... I could be in here the rest of my life?
Yes.
But we're trying to find the aliens that did this to you.
The Captain is doing everything she can.
Well... if I'm going to be in here a while, now's as good a time as any to tell you.
Your ceiling is hideous.
I didn't design the room.
I just work here.
Something with a bit of color would help.
Maybe a nice tapestry or a painting.
Uh, could you dim the lights a little?
I'm a doctor, Mr. Neelix, not a decorator.
Perhaps you would be willing to accommodate his... aesthetic needs.
And some music would be nice.
Or better yet, are you programmed to sing?
Janeway to Paris.
Please report to the Bridge.
I'm on my way, Captain.
You know where l am if you need me.
Thanks for everything.
Oh, fine.
I have a little accident, I lose a pair of lungs, and the next thing I know
Paris is swooping in like a Rectilian vulture.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you hear the way that he said that?
"l'll be on the Bridge if you need me."
"lf you need me."
Neelix...
Why doesn't he just pull the plug on the holographic emitter, and get it over with, get me out of the way, so he can have you all to himself?
Neelix, you're overreacting.
Tom's been very supportive.
Ah, so it's "Tom" now, is it?
You really have nothing to worry about.
We're friends, that's all.
It's not you I'm worried about.
It's him.
He's just... one big hormone walking around the ship.
Don't you see the way that he looks at you?
This is ridiculous.
I am not going to argue with you about something that exists only in your imagination.
I know you, Neelix.
And I know you're afraid.
I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I'll be here with you.
Ke...
Kes... I could be in here a very long time.
You need to go on with your life.
Don't worry about me.
Neelix...
You should just let me die.
Stop that.
We're going to get through this together.
Visiting hours are over.
He needs rest.
When can I come back?
1700 hours, not a minute before.
I'll see you then.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kiss you.
I'm only adjusting the restraint.
I'll try to contain my disappointment.
Captain, we've completed our diagnostic on the alien device.
It appears to be more than a weapon.
It's also a very sophisticated medical scanner and surgical instrument.
From what we can tell, lt uses a neural resonator to stun the victim while a quantum imaging scanner begins a microcellular analysis of the entire body.
The amount of information this thing can gather puts a tricorder to shame.
You fire this at someone, you learn everything about their anatomy, right down to their DNA sequencing.
So it sounds like we're dealing with aliens who've developed a technology specifically designed to locate and extract organs from other beings.
Why?
Captain.
The alien ship has dropped out of warp.
It's approaching a large asteroid.
On screen.
It's entered the asteroid, Captain.
Hold position here.
Mr. Kim?
I can't scan the interior.
The surface stratum is made up of some sort of neutronium alloy.
It doesn't look like a natural formation.
Are you saying someone built this asteroid?
It's possible.
Any sign of weapons or defense systems?
Negative.
I think I've located where the alien ship entered.
There's an open crater on the limb of the asteroid.
Let's see it.
The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside.
How large is that crater?
200 meters in diameter.
Captain, may I suggest you consider carefully what you are about to do.
How do you know what I'm about to do?
I could describe to you in detail the psychological observations I've made about you over the past four years, which lead me to conclude you're about to take this ship inside the asteroid, but suffice it to say
I know you quite well.
One of these days, I'm going to surprise you, Tuvok, but not today.
I've already considered other options.
If Neelix has any chance of surviving, we have to act fast.
Red Alert.
Mr. Paris, lay in a course.
Aye, Captain.
Mr. Tuvok, maximum shields.
Phasers at the ready.
Captain, I'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only.
This passageway is getting a little too narrow for my taste.
Use your discretion, Mr. Paris.
Any sign of the vessel, Lieutenant?
We're still following the ion trail, but electromagnetic interference is limiting our sensor range.
I'm only able to scan 500 meters ahead of us.
Are there any indications we're being scanned or probed, Mr. Kim?
Not yet.
Doctor?
Doctor, I require your assistance.
What is it, Mr. Neelix?
Please, it's urgent.
Yes?
I have an itch.
An itch?
Just above my left eyebrow.
A little higher.
Oh, thank you.
You're quite welcome.
Doctor, wait, don't leave.
I'm not leaving, Mr. Neelix.
I'm simply going back to work.
I can't see you over there.
I...
I feel like I'm all alone.
You are all alone.
I'm a holographic projection-- a projection with a lot of work to do, I might add.
That's very amusing, Doctor.
But... um... I'm really starting to feel a little, uh... trapped in here.
A little claustrophobic maybe.
I'm not sure what to do.
There's nothing you can do except lie there and be quiet.
I'm going to lie here for the rest of my life, aren't I?
Just staring up at the ceiling.
I'm not sure I can take that.
I really need to get out of this restraint.
Doctor, I want you to let me out of this thing right now.
You know that's impossible.
I'm the patient.
I know what my rights are.
I want to be released from this restraint immediately.
lmmediately!
Mr. Neelix, you are alive, you are breathing and for the moment, your condition is stable.
That is more than most people can say in your situation.
Now, it is critical to your recovery that you not subject yourself to any additional stress.
Try to calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You're not the one trapped in a restraining field with holo-lungs.
I don't think they're working.
I can't...
I can't get enough oxygen.
There's something wrong.
You're hyperventilating.
Try to take slow, natural breaths.
I can't.
I'm dying.
Let me out of here.
Will you help me?
Help me.
Help me!
You're doing just fine, Mr. Paris.
Just fine.
Thanks, Captain.
Sensors detect a large chamber ahead.
What the hell?
We appear to be seeing Voyager and the alien ship reflecting off the walls of the chamber.
Can you determine which ship is the real one?
No, Captain.
The walls are emanating severe electromagnetic interference.
I cannot scan them directly.
It's like trying to move through a hall of mirrors.
You never know when you're going to walk into the glass.
I'm still picking up the alien's ion trail.
Maybe we should follow that.
They might have left a fake ion trail to lure us in here.
It could lead us right into one of those walls.
That's a chance we're going to have to take.
Tuvok, extend the deflectors to maximum range.
If we do run into something, it'll give us an extra margin of error.
Follow the ion trail, Mr. Paris, slowly.
Mr. Kim, continuous scans.
Aye, Captain.
I'll do what I can to reassure him, Doctor.
Good. lf you don't mind, I'd like you to remain in Sick Bay, so you're here when he wakes up.
Of course.
Are you all right?
Me?
You seem agitated about something.
Of course I'm agitated.
This entire situation is getting out of control.
You mean Neelix.
First they tell me there's no doctor, so I have to be on call 24 hours a day.
And then they tell me there are no nurses, so I have no one to assist me.
I thought Tom Paris was assigned to you.
Like I said, no one to assist me, and now I have a patient with severe and possibly long-term emotional problems and there's no Counselor on board.
I am an emergency medical supplement-- a supplement, that's all.
I wasn't programmed for any of this.
It's just... unacceptable.
I don't know anything about holographic engineering, but if you want my opinion, you haven't been acceptable.
You've been remarkable.
I've only done what the program allows me to.
Give yourself some credit.
You saved his life.
You did-- not some program.
It may seem that way to you.
That's exactly how it seems.
You're very... kind.
How does a real doctor learn to deal with patients' emotional problems, anyway?
They learn from experience.
Aren't you capable of learning?
I have the capacity to accumulate and process data, yes.
Then I guess you'll just have to learn... like the rest of us.
Have you ever considered a career in medicine?
Neelix is starting to regain consciousness.
Lieutenant, I'm picking up a minor power fluctuation in the warp core.
Compensate with the KLS stabilizer.
No effect.
In fact, the power loss is starting to accelerate.
Janeway to Torres.
What's going on down there?
Some kind of power drain.
I can't localize it, but... we're losing power at a rate of seven percent per minute.
The power drain is coming from somewhere in this chamber, Captain.
Some kind of dampening field.
It's bleeding energy directly from the warp nacelles.
B'Elanna, shut down the warp core.
Go to emergency power.
No effect, Captain.
Keep me informed.
Bridge out.
Can you pinpoint the source of the dampening field?
It appears to be coming from 217 mark 015.
Distance 547 meters.
Tuvok.
What would happen if we locked phasers and fired at the source?
The walls of this chamber reflect directed energy.
The phaser beam would ricochet along an unpredictable path, possibly impacting our ship in the process.
All right.
We won't try that.
Well, maybe we should.
Tuvok, what would happen if we reduced the phaser power level to a minimum setting and sent out a continuous beam?
The phaser would continue to reflect off the bulkheads until it encountered a nonreflective material.
Until it encountered a nonreflective material-- like the real alien ship.
So we could use the phasers like a searchlight... scan the interior of the station until we find the ship.
Exactly.
Do it.
Adjusting phaser azimuth to 15 degrees.
Wait a minute.
I think I've found the real ship.
On screen.
Mr. Paris, bring us within transporter range of that ship.
Aye, Captain.
I'm picking up two life signs.
They're powering engines.
Bridge to Transporter Room 3.
Lock on to those two life signs and beam them aboard.
Security, meet me in Transporter Room 3.
Aye, sir.
You're on the Starship Voyager.
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the United Federation of Planets.
I am Dereth... of the Vidiian Sodality.
You attacked one of our crew members and you lured us into this asteroid.
Why?
We are gathering replacement organs and suitable biomatter.
It is the only way we have to fight the phage.
A virus?
Some kind of disease?
Yes.
It attacked our people over two millennia ago.
It consumes our bodies destroys our genetic codes and cellular structures.
So you harvest the bodies of other beings to replace your own tissues as they're consumed by this... phage?
Our immunotechnology cannot keep up.
The phage adapts.
It resists all attempts to destroy it.
Our society has been ravaged.
Thousands die each day.
There is no other way for us to survive.
I have a great... sympathy for what your race has endured.
But I cannot allow you to keep the organs you removed from one of our crew members.
We need them back immediately.
I'm afraid that isn't possible.
I have already biochemically altered the air-breathing organs and grafted them into Motura's body.
They are a part of him now.
He is my honatta.
His task is to find the organs I need for survival.
We... we try to extract them from the dead...
But sometimes, when the need is immediate more aggressive actions are required.
So now I am left with the same choice you made-- whether to commit murder to save a life, or to allow my own crewman to die while you breathe air through his lungs.
It must be impossible for you to understand how any civilized people could come to... this.
Before the phage began, we were known as educators and explorers-- a people whose greatest achievements were artistic.
I, myself, am a sculptor of note on my world.
All I can say is that when your entire existence is at stake...
You don't have to explain yourself, Motura.
If the consequence of this act is a death sentence, so be it.
At least it will put an end to my suffering.
I can't begin to understand what your people have gone through.
They may have found a way to ignore the moral implications of what you're doing, but I have no such luxury.
I don't have the freedom to kill you to save another.
My culture finds that to be a reprehensible and entirely unacceptable act.
If we were closer to home, I would lock you up and turn you over to my authorities for trial but I don't even have that ability here, and I am not prepared to carry you forever in our brig.
So I see no other alternative... but to let you go.
Take a message to your people.
If I ever encounter your kind again, I will do whatever is necessary to protect my people from this...
harvesting of yours.
Any aggressive actions against this ship or its crew will be met by the deadliest force.
is that clear?
Uh... quite.
Wait.
I want to see this crewman of yours.
That can serve no useful purpose.
Maybe it can.
Our medical technologies may be superior to theirs.
I can tell you, from what we've observed of them, that they are considerably superior.
She spared my life-- our lives.
We owe it to them to see if there's anything we can do to help him.
I'll take you to him.
His simulated organs are primitive.
It's amazing he is still alive.
This is set to scan only.
Proceed... carefully.
Strange.
According to my readings, you are not here.
Believe me, I wish I weren't.
The rest of you are healthy.
You are compatible for organ transplant.
Wait a minute.
We've already considered this.
Talaxian physiology is different from that of anyone else on this ship.
His immune system would reject their lungs immediately.
Your surgical knowledge is inferior.
We will simply adapt his immunogenicity.
It won't be a problem.
Which of you will donate a lung?
Me.
No!
Absolutely not.
It's too dangerous.
Let someone else do it.
No, I want to do it, Neelix.
I'm willing to take the risk.
Besides, you've done so much for me.
Let me give you something once.
Just for once.
All right.
I look forward to sampling your cooking, Mr. Neelix.
You mean I can keep my kitchen?
Well, at least until we get the replicators back on line.
Thank you, Captain.
And, Captain... I'll see you at breakfast.
Captain's Log, supplemental.
The aliens have successfully transplanted one of Kes's lungs into Neelix.
The dampening field has been deactivated, and I have allowed them to beam back to their vessel.
We are resuming a course home.
It's all right.
The operation was a success.
Neelix is asleep and breathing on his own now... with your lung.
I feel a little light-headed.
That will pass.
You'll soon adapt to diminished lung capacity.
I spoke to the Captain about you.
She's given me permission to begin training you as a medical assistant.
You'll be a backup for Mr. Paris or, possibly, a replacement.
That is, assuming you're interested.
Of course I'm interested.
When do we start?
We'll begin your lessons as soon as you've fully recovered.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
You've... given me a lot to think about.
Captain's log, stardate 48532.4.
We're on our way to a rogue planetoid which is a rich source of dilithium.
This could go a long way toward easing our power shortage.
If we do find dilithium on this planetoid, we'll need a refining facility.
Lieutenant Torres wants to modify the auxiliary impulse reactor.
It could be converted into a crude dilithium refinery.
The impulse reactor?
B'Elanna tries to find solutions that ignore Starfleet procedures.
- She thinks it can be done safely.
- I'm sure it can.
I want reports on her progress every step of the way.
You won't join me for breakfast?
I was thinking of having eggs Benedict with asparagus, strawberries and cream...
I said I was thinking about it.
I'm actually having stewed tomatoes with dehydrated eggs.
Sounds delicious but I've already had my vacuum-packed oatmeal.
I'll see you on the bridge.
- Enjoy it.
- What is going on?
- Captain, you caught me by surprise.
- What are you doing?
I know you and the other senior officers have been disappointed with the rations so I'm using a few vegetables from the hydroponics bay to whip up a little breakfast.
You've turned this into a galley?
I had to reroute the mess hall power conduits and scrounge supplies from all over.
But my specialty is making something out of nothing.
In a few days you'll swear there's been a galley here for years.
Careful.
That one is spicy.
- Who approved this?
- Well... no one.
You might have asked me first.
This used to be my private dining room.
Yours?
If you had checked the directory you'd have noticed that this is the Captain's private dining room.
Then I'll guess you'll want me to move all this stuff out of your way.
Bridge to Captain Janeway.
We're approaching the rogue planetoid.
On my way.
Come with me.
We will deal with this later.
Ensign Parsons, would you keep an eye on things?
Rotate the darvot fritters until they turn a deep chartreuse.
Remember, one to a customer.
- What have you found?
- Definite dilithium signatures.
The strongest readings are from 20 kilometres inside the planetoid.
There are subterranean caves with an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
It'll be easier if we can go in without environmental suits.
- How much dilithium is there?
- It's hard to get a precise reading.
It could be anywhere from 500 to 1,000 metric tons.
Just as I said.
I bet there are a few dilithium engineers who'd give their spinal columns to know where this planet is.
Take an away team and do a preliminary geological analysis.
Get your dilithium refinery on-line.
- It'll be ready to go in three days.
- Ensign Kim?
- Where are you going?
- With you.
I've been studying tricorder operations.
I'm up-to-date on dilithium geophysics.
I've been preparing for this mission all week.
- Very well, Mr Neelix.
- I think you'll find me extremely helpful.
The first time I flew past this planet...
Deck 4.
There are several large deposits in this vicinity.
Let's split up and take geological scans.
Keep your com channels open and don't wander too far.
Stay within 50 metres of this position.
- Chakotay to Kim.
- Go ahead.
I'm still picking up dilithium signatures but there are no dilithium formations.
- Have you found anything?
- I'm analysing the rock here.
- There's no indication of dilithium.
- Keep looking.
- Neelix to Commander Chakotay.
- Go ahead.
I think I've found something - a large cavern approximately 20 metres from my position.
- I'm reading a huge dilithium formation.
- Don't go any further.
Stay within the search radius.
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- But it's right here.
I'm in the cavern now, Commander.
But...
I don't understand this.
Let me guess.
Nothing there.
Not so much as a sliver of dilithium, yet I should be surrounded by it.
I've had enough of this.
We're heading back to the ship.
- Rendezvous at the...
- Wait a minute.
I'm getting unusual readings from this rock face.
Traces of organic energy.
Looks like a bioelectrical signature.
I think there's something alive down here.
It's about two metres into this rock face.
Neelix, I said get back here.
- Neelix, did you hear me?
- Just one minute, Commander.
Hello?
Is there someone there?
Hello?
I know there's somebody.
Neelix, what's wrong?
Neelix!
- Kim!
- I'm on my way, sir.
I think he's in shock.
Chakotay to Voyager.
Beam us directly to sickbay.
- Get the blood-gas infuser.
- The what?
Equipment storage unit 2, second shelf on the left.
Now!
Hold him still.
- What's happening?
- He's going into a coma.
This will keep his oxygen levels stable for an hour, then he'll die.
His lungs have been removed.
- Then he was unconscious.
- How could organs be removed so fast?
They used some kind of transporter to beam the lungs out of his body.
- What happened?
- Neelix was attacked.
We don't know how it happened, but someone has removed his lungs.
- Did you find the lifesign he reported?
- No.
I've analysed Neelix's sensor logs.
There was a single class-3 humanoid organism.
The infuser will keep him alive for another 47 minutes.
The only chance for survival is to get his own lungs back.
Can't we fit artificial lungs?
His respiratory system is linked to points along his spine.
It's too complex.
I may be able to reattach the organs if we get them back.
For now I'll have to search for other options.
I'm taking an away team back to the planet.
You're in charge.
I want three armed security detachments to come with us.
Issue type-3 phasers.
Did they teach you how to run a respiratory series at the Academy?
- No, I'm afraid they didn't.
- Fine.
I'll run it myself.
Get me a pulmonary scanner.
I have to ask you to leave.
- I'm not leaving.
- OK.
Just keep out of the way.
This is where Neelix was when he was attacked.
He was scanning this rock face when he detected the lifesign.
He said there was a lifesign two metres behind this wall.
But my tricorder says there's nothing but solid rock for 15 metres.
Our tricorders aren't giving us the real picture.
Wait a minute.
The rock is warmer here.
There's a two-degree differential.
No natural geological phenomena could create this heat.
Let's make some heat of our own.
- There was a force field in place.
- There's a chamber down here.
Doc, I think his cellular toxicity level is rising.
Let's see if we can stabilise those levels.
Get me a cytoplasmic stimulator.
- We don't have one.
- Then replicate one.
The design schematics are in the ship's medical database.
The man drives a starship so someone thinks he'd make a good medic.
Can I survive with one lung?
What if I donated one to Neelix?
No one aboard is a compatible match for a Talaxian.
We need a completely new way to oxygenate his blood supply and relay neuro-electrical impulses.
We can't produce compatible artificial organs but maybe there's a way to mimic their functions and give us control of his respiratory system.
Computer, is there an identification matrix on Neelix?
- Affirmative.
- Transfer it to console 4.
- What are you doing?
- Getting specifications for his lungs.
- You said we can't replicate them.
- We can't.
But if I can reconfigure my emitter array,
I might be able to create a pair of holographic lungs.
Holographic lungs?
We could control his pulmonary functions to allow normal breathing.
But a hologram is just a projection of light.
There's no real matter involved.
Now...
You hit me.
The containment field that creates my body can allow matter to pass through it or... be stopped.
I can modulate the lungs that way, allowing oxygen to pass to the bloodstream.
What does this mean?
What are you going to do to him?
- There's no time to explain.
- Well, make the time.
I won't let you perform any experimental surgery on him until I know what you're doing and what the risks are.
The risk is that it won't work, and if it doesn't, he'll die.
But it is his only chance for survival.
If he does survive he'll have to be held motionless.
The lungs need to be perfectly aligned.
There can't be any body movement whatsoever.
- For how long?
- The rest of his life.
Unless we are able to retrieve his original organs.
He will never be able to leave this room.
The holo-lungs would disappear.
Kes...
I know it sounds pretty grim, but it's better than losing him completely.
This way, he'll still be alive.
Maybe we can find a better solution later.
- What do you think Neelix would want?
- I'm not sure.
But I do know that I want him to live.
This room is the source of the dilithium signature.
The power systems are running on a dilithium matrix.
- So there are no dilithium deposits here.
- It would appear not.
Are these organs?
This looks like a storage facility.
Yes.
This appears to be a biological repository.
- Any sign of Neelix's lungs?
- Negative.
But there is a Kazon liver.
I cannot identify the other organs here, but they look like pulmonary organs, epidermal tissue, nerve fibre...
Save the cataloguing.
There was a life-form in here ten minutes ago.
Open it.
One lifesign 20 metres ahead.
Let's go.
They have erected a force field.
We will not be able to disrupt it.
Voyager to Captain Janeway.
An alien ship just left the planet.
- Tractor them.
- They went into warp too quickly.
Beam us back then lay in a course for pursuit.
Maximum warp.
OK.
The restraint is activated.
He won't be able to move more than two microns.
One micron would be preferable but it'll have to do.
Initiating the holographic emitter array.
His cellular toxicity is rising.
82%... 86%.
Computer, activate programme Neelix-1.
Deactivate the infuser.
- It's off-line.
- Here we go.
90%... 95%.
Toxicity returning to normal.
Captain's log, supplemental.
We are pursuing the alien ship.
They are not responding to hails.
Our two ships are evenly matched for speed.
Holographic lungs?
Yes.
And they're working perfectly, if I do say so myself.
Try to breathe normally.
- How long can I live like this?
- I don't know.
This is an unprecedented procedure.
We will closely monitor your condition.
When do I get out of this restraint?
Unless Captain Janeway retrieves your lungs, you'll have to stay in the restraint indefinitely.
Indefinitely?
You mean I could be in here the rest of my life?
Yes.
But we're trying to find the aliens that did this.
The Captain's doing everything she can.
Well, if I'm gonna be in here a while... now is as good a time as any to tell you.
Your ceiling is hideous.
- I didn't design the room.
- A bit of colour would help.
Maybe a nice tapestry or a painting.
- Could you dim the lights a little?
- I'm a doctor, not a decorator.
Perhaps you would be willing to accommodate his aesthetic needs.
Some music would be nice.
Or better yet, are you programmed to sing?
Janeway to Paris.
Please report to the bridge.
I'm on my way.
- You know where I am if you need me.
- Thanks for everything.
Oh, fine.
I have a little accident and lose a pair of lungs.
And the next thing I know, Paris is swooping in like a Rectilian vulture.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear the way he spoke?
"I'll be on the bridge if you need me."
- If you need me.
- Neelix...
Why doesn't he pull the plug on the holographic emitter?
He could have you all to himself.
You're overreacting.
Tom's been very supportive.
Ah, so it's "Tom" now, is it?
You have nothing to worry about.
We're just friends.
It's not you I'm worried about.
It's him.
He's just one big hormone walking around the ship.
Don't you see the way that he looks at you?
This is ridiculous.
I'm not going to argue with you about something that exists only in your imagination.
I know you, Neelix.
And I know you're afraid.
I just want you to know that whatever happens, I'll be here with you.
Kes, I could be in here a very long time.
You need to go on with your life.
Don't worry about me.
Neelix...
- You should just let me die.
- Stop that!
- We'll get through this together.
- Visiting hours are over.
He needs rest.
- When can I come back?
- 1700 hours.
Not a minute before.
I'll see you then.
I'm not going to kiss you.
I'm only adjusting the restraint.
I'll try to contain my disappointment.
We've completed our diagnostic on the alien device.
It's more than a weapon.
It's a medical scanner and surgical instrument.
It uses a neural resonator to stun the victim while it begins a micro-cellular analysis of the body.
This thing puts a tricorder to shame.
This teaches you all about someone's anatomy, right down to their DNA sequencing.
So these aliens have developed a technology to locate and extract organs from other beings.
- Why?
- Captain.
The alien ship is approaching a large asteroid.
- On screen.
- It's entered the asteroid.
- Hold position.
Mr Kim?
- I can't scan the interior.
The surface stratum is made up of a neutronium alloy.
- It doesn't look like a natural formation.
- Someone built it?
- It's possible.
- Any sign of defence systems?
- Negative.
- I've found where the ship entered.
- There's an open crater on the rim.
- Let's see it.
The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside.
- How large is that crater?
- 200 metres in diameter.
Captain, consider carefully what you're about to do.
- How do you know what that is?
- I could describe to you in detail the psychological observations I've made about you which lead me to think you will take us inside the asteroid.
But suffice it to say, I know you quite well.
One of these days I'm going to surprise you.
But not today.
I've considered other options.
If Neelix has any chance of surviving, we have to act fast.
- Red Alert.
Mr Paris, lay in a course.
- Aye, Captain.
Mr Tuvok, maximum shields.
Phasers at the ready.
Captain, I'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only.
This passageway is getting a little too narrow.
Use your discretion, Mr Paris.
Any sign of the vessel?
We're following the ion trail but our sensor range is limited.
I'm only able to scan 500 metres ahead of us.
Are we being scanned or probed?
Not yet.
Doctor?
- Doctor, I require your assistance.
- What is it?
- Please!
It's urgent!
- Yes?
- I have an itch.
- An itch.
Just above my left eyebrow.
A little higher.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're quite welcome.
- Don't leave!
- I'm not leaving.
- I'm simply going back to work.
- I can't see you over there.
- I feel alone.
- You are alone.
I'm a holographic projection.
One with a lot of work to do.
That's very amusing, Doctor.
But I'm really starting to feel a little trapped in here.
A little claustrophobic maybe.
- I'm not sure what to do.
- Just lie there and be quiet.
I'm going to lie here for the rest of my life, aren't I?
Just staring up at the ceiling.
I'm not sure I can take that.
I really need to get out of this restraint.
Doctor, I want you to let me out of this thing right now.
- You know that's impossible.
- I know what my rights are.
I want to be released from this restraint immediately.
Immediately!
Mr Neelix, you are alive.
You are breathing.
That is more than most people can say in your situation.
It is critical that you not subject yourself to any additional stress.
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!
You're not the one trapped in a restraining field with holo... holo-lungs.
I don't think they're working.
I can't... can't get enough oxygen.
- There's something wrong.
- You're hyperventilating.
Try to take slow, natural breaths.
I can't...
I'm dying.
Let me out of here.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
- You're doing just fine, Mr Paris.
- Thanks, Captain.
Sensors detect a large chamber ahead.
What the hell...?
We're seeing Voyager and the alien ship reflecting off the walls.
Which ship is the real one?
I don't know.
The walls are emanating interference.
- I cannot scan them.
- It's like a hall of mirrors.
You never know when you'll hit the glass.
I'm still picking up the alien's ion trail.
Maybe we should follow that.
They might have left a fake trail to lure us in.
- It could lead us into a wall.
- That's a chance we'll have to take.
Extend the deflectors to maximum range.
That will give us a margin of error.
Follow the ion train, Mr Paris.
Slowly.
- Mr Kim, continue with scans.
- Aye, Captain.
- I'll try to reassure him.
- Good.
I'd like you to remain in sickbay so you're here when he wakes up.
Of course.
- Are you all right?
- Me?
- You seem agitated.
- This situation is getting out of control.
You mean Neelix?
First there's no doctor so I have to be on call 24 hours a day.
Then there are no nurses so I have no assistance.
I thought Tom Paris was assigned to you.
Like I said, no one to assist me.
And now I have a patient with severe emotional problems and there's no counsellor on board.
I am an Emergency Medical supplement.
A supplement.
That's all.
I wasn't programmed for any of this.
It's just... unacceptable.
I don't know anything about holograms, but you haven't been acceptable, you've been remarkable.
I've only done what the program allows me to.
Give yourself some credit.
You saved his life.
You did.
Not some program.
- It may seem that way...
- That's exactly how it seems.
You're very... kind.
How does a real doctor learn to deal with patients' emotions?
- From experience.
- Aren't you capable of learning?
I can accumulate and process data, yes.
Then I guess you'll just have to learn.
Like the rest of us.
Have you considered a career in medicine?
Neelix is regaining consciousness.
There's a minor fluctuation in the warp core.
Compensate with the KLS stabiliser.
No effect.
The power loss is accelerating.
- What's going on?
- Some kind of power drain.
I can't localise it but we're losing power at a rate of 7% per minute.
The power drain is in this chamber.
Some kind of dampening field.
- It's bleeding energy from the nacelles.
- Shut down the warp core.
Go to emergency power.
- No effect.
- Keep me informed.
Bridge out.
What's the source of the field?
It appears to be coming from 217, mark 015.
Distance, 547 metres.
What would happen if we fired at the source?
The walls of this chamber reflect energy.
The phaser beam would ricochet, possibly impacting our ship.
- We won't try that.
- Maybe we should.
What would happen if we reduced the power level to a minimum setting and sent out a continuous beam?
The phaser would reflect until it encountered a non-reflective material.
A non-reflective material.
Like the real alien ship.
We could use the phasers like a searchlight, scan until we find the ship.
- Exactly.
- Do it.
- Adjusting phaser azimuth.
- I think I've found the real ship.
On screen.
Bring us within transporter range of that ship.
- Two lifesigns.
- They're powering engines.
Transporter room 3, beam them aboard.
Security, meet me in transporter room 3.
You're on the starship Voyager.
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the United Federation of Planets.
I'm Dereth of the Vidiian Sodality.
You attacked one of our crew members and you've lured us here.
Why?
We're gathering replacement organs and suitable bio matter.
It is the only way we have to fight the phage.
A virus?
Some kind of disease?
Yes.
It attacked our people over two millennia ago.
It consumes our bodies, destroys our genetic codes and cellular structures.
So you harvest the bodies of other beings to replace your own tissues as they're consumed by this phage?
Our immuno-technology cannot keep up.
The phage adapts.
It resists all attempts to destroy it.
Our society has been ravaged.
Thousands die each day.
There is no other way for us to survive.
I have a great... sympathy for what your race has endured.
But you cannot keep the organs you removed from my crew member.
We need them back immediately.
I'm afraid that isn't possible.
I have already biochemically altered the air-breathing organs, and grafted them into Motura's body.
They are a part of him now.
He is my honatta.
His task is to find the organs I need for survival.
We... we try to extract them from the dead...
But sometimes, when the need is immediate, more aggressive actions are required.
So now I'm left with the same choice you made - whether to commit murder to save a life, or to allow my own crewman to die, while you breathe air through his lungs.
It must be impossible for you to understand how any civilised people could come to this.
Before the phage began, we were known as educators and explorers, a people whose greatest achievements were artistic.
I myself am a sculptor of note on my world.
All I can say is that when your entire existence is at stake...
You don't have to explain yourself, Motura.
If the consequence of this act is a death sentence... so be it.
At least it will put an end to my suffering.
I can't begin to understand what your people have gone through.
They can ignore the moral implications of this, but I have no such luxury.
I don't have the freedom to kill you to save another.
My culture finds that to be a reprehensible, unacceptable act.
If we were closer to home, I'd turn you over to my authorities.
But I don't even have that ability, and I won't carry you forever in our brig.
So I see no other alternative... but to let you go.
And take a message to your people.
If I ever encounter your kind again,
I will do whatever is necessary to protect my people from your harvesting.
Any aggressive actions against this ship or its crew will be met by the deadliest force.
Is that clear?
Quite.
Wait.
I want to see this crewman of yours.
- That can serve no useful purpose.
- Maybe it can.
Our technology may be superior to theirs.
From what we've observed, they are considerably superior.
She spared my life.
Our lives.
We must see if there's anything we can do to help him.
I'll take you to him.
His simulated organs are primitive.
It's amazing he is still alive.
This is set to scan only.
Proceed.
Carefully.
Strange.
According to my readings, you are not here.
Believe me, I wish I weren't.
The rest of you are healthy.
You are compatible for organ transplant.
Wait.
We've already considered this.
Talaxian physiology is different from anyone else's.
His immune system would reject their lungs.
Your surgical knowledge is inferior.
We will simply adapt his immunogenicity.
It won't be a problem.
Which of you will donate a lung?
- Me.
- No.
It's too dangerous.
Let someone else do it.
I want to do it, Neelix.
I'm willing to take the risk.
You've done so much for me.
Let me give you something.
Just for once.
All right.
I'll look forward to sampling your cooking.
You mean I can keep my kitchen?
Well, at least until we get the replicators back on-line.
Thank you, Captain.
And Captain?
I'll see you at breakfast.
Captain's log, supplemental.
The aliens have transplanted one of Kes's lungs into Neelix.
I have allowed them to beam back to their vessel.
We are resuming a course home.
It's all right.
The operation was a success.
Neelix is asleep and breathing on his own.
With your lung.
- I feel a little light-headed.
- That will pass.
You'll adapt to diminished lung capacity.
The Captain has given me permission to train you as a medical assistant.
You'll be a back-up for Mr Paris.
Or possibly a replacement.
- That is, assuming you're interested.
- Of course I'm interested.
- When do we start?
- As soon as you've fully recovered.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
You've given me a lot to think about.
Captain's Log, Stardate 48532.4.
We're on our way to a rogue planetoid which Mr. Neelix tells us is an extremely rich source of raw dilithium.
If he's right, this could go a long way toward easing our power shortage.
Assuming we do find dilithium on this planetoid, we're going to need a refining facility on the ship to process it.
Lieutenant Torres has already asked permission to start modifications to the auxiliary impulse reactor.
It could be converted into a crude dilithium refinery.
The impulse reactor?
Sometimes I think B'Elanna goes out of her way to find solutions that ignore Starfleet procedures.
Her arguments are quite convincing.
She thinks it can be done safely.
I'm sure it can.
Tell her I want regular reports on her progress every step of the way.
Are you sure you won't join me for breakfast?
I was thinking of having eggs Benedict with asparagus, strawberries and cream... I said I was thinking about it.
I'm actually having ration pack #5-- stewed tomatoes with dehydrated eggs.
Mmm, sounds delicious, but I've already had my vacuum-packed oatmeal this morning.
I'll see you on the Bridge.
Here you are.
Hope you enjoy it.
What is going on here?
Captain, you caught me by surprise.
I could say the same thing.
What are you doing?
I know how you and the other, uh, senior officers have been-- excuse me-- disappointed with the rations lately, so I thought I'd use a few of the vegetables from the hydroponics bay and whip up a... ooh, a little breakfast.
You have turned this into a Galley?
It wasn't easy.
I had to completely reroute the Mess Hall power conduits and scrounge a lot of supplies from all over the ship, but that's my specialty-- making something out of nothing.
I know it doesn't look like much now, but in a few days, you'll swear there'd been a Galley here for years.
Careful.
That one is a little spicy.
Neelix... who approved this?
Uh, well... no one.
Well, you might have asked me first.
This used to be my private dining room.
Your, your dining room?
If you had checked the ship's directory, you'd have noticed that Cabin 125-Alpha, Deck 2, is designated as the Captain's Private Dining Room.
Oh... oh, ah, then I guess that you'll be wanting me to move all of this stuff out of your way?
Bridge to Captain Janeway.
Go ahead.
We're approaching the rogue planetoid, Captain.
On my way.
I want you to come with me.
We will deal with this later.
Ensign Parsons, would you mind keeping an eye on things until I get back... and, uh, rotate the darvot fritters every ten minutes until they turn a deep chartreuse.
And remember-- one, one to a customer.
What have you found?
We're picking up definite dilithium signatures, Captain.
The strongest readings are originating from ten to 20 kilometers inside the planetoid.
It also looks like there's a series of subterranean caves with an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
Class-M.
It'll make mining a lot easier if we can go in there without environmental suits.
How much dilithium are we talking about?
It's hard to get a precise reading.
It could be anywhere from 500 to... 1,000 metric tons.
Just as I said.
I bet there are few Yallitian engineers who'd give all three of their spinal columns to know where this planet is.
Commander, take an away team down into those caves and do a preliminary geological analysis.
Lieutenant, you'd better get your dilithium refinery on line.
It'll be ready to go in three days.
Ensign Kim.
Where are you going?
With you.
I've been studying my Tricorder Operations Manual.
Lieutenant Torres has brought me up-to-date on dilithium geophysics.
I've been preparing for this mission all week.
Very well, Mr. Neelix.
I think you'll find me extremely helpful, Commander.
I remember the first time that I flew past this planet.
It was about three years ago...
Deck 4.
Looks like there are several large deposits in this general vicinity.
Let's split up and begin taking geological scans.
Keep your com channels open at all times and don't wander too far.
Stay within a 50-meter radius of this position.
Chakotay to Kim.
Go ahead.
I'm still picking up dilithium signatures... but there are no dilithium formations here.
Have you found anything yet?
I'm running a geo-stratal analysis of the rock in this vicinity.
But so far, there's no indication of any dilithium.
Keep looking.
Neelix to Commander Chakotay.
Go ahead.
I think I found something-- a large cavern approximately 20 meters from my position.
I'm reading a huge dilithium formation there.
Don't go any further, Neelix.
Stay within the search radius.
I'll be with you in a minute.
But it's right here!
I'm in the cavern now, Commander, but... I don't understand this.
Let me guess-- nothing there?
Not so much as a sliver of dilithium.
And yet, according to my readings, I should be surrounded by it.
All right, I've had enough of this.
Kim, Neelix, we're heading back to the ship.
Rendezvous with the...
Wait a minute.
I'm getting unusual readings from this rock face.
Traces of organic energy.
Looks like a bioelectrical signature.
I think there's something alive down here.
It's about... two meters into this rock face.
Neelix, I said get back here.
Neelix, did you hear what I said?
Just one minute, Commander.
Hello?
is there someone there?
Hello?
I know there's somebody...
Neelix, what's wrong?
Neelix!
Kim!
I'm on my way, sir.
I can't be sure, but I think he's going into shock.
Chakotay to Voyager-- medical emergency.
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.
Get the blood-gas infuser.
The what?
Equipment Storage Unit 2, second shelf on the left, now.
Hold him still.
What's happening, Doctor?
He's going into a coma.
The infuser will keep his oxygen level stable for the next hour or so, but after that, he'll die.
His lungs have been removed.
By the time we got to him, he was unconscious.
How could anyone remove his organs so quickly?
The doctor says whoever did this used some kind of transporter to beam the lungs directly out of his body.
What happened?
It appears that Neelix was attacked.
We don't know how it happened, but someone has surgically removed his lungs.
Did you find any evidence of the life sign that Neelix reported?
No.
Captain, I've analyzed the sensor logs from Neelix's tricorder.
The bio-scanner picked up a single class-3 humanoid organism.
The blood-gas infuser will keep him alive for another 47 minutes.
The only chance for his survival I see at the moment is to get his own lungs back.
Can't we fit him with a pair of artificial lungs?
His respiratory system is directly linked to multiple points along his spinal column.
It's too complex to replicate.
I may be able to surgically reattach the organs if we get them back.
In the meantime, I'll have to search for other options.
Commander, I'm taking an away team back to the planet.
You're in charge until we return.
Inform Mr. Tuvok I want three armed security detachments to accompany us.
Issue type-3 phasers.
Mr. Paris, did they teach you how to run a respiratory series in your biochemistry classes at the Academy?
No, I'm afraid they didn't.
Fine. I'll run it myself.
Get me a pulmonary scanner.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I'm not leaving.
All right, just keep out of the way.
Here it is.
This is where Neelix was standing when he was attacked.
According to his tricorder log, he was scanning this rock face when he detected the life sign.
Neelix said there was a life sign two meters behind this wall, but my tricorder says there's nothing but solid rock for another 15 meters.
It sounds like our tricorders aren't giving us the real picture behind what's going on here.
Wait a minute.
The rock is warmer here.
You're right, Captain.
There's a two-degree differential in this section of the wall.
There are no natural geological phenomena that could be creating this heat source.
Let's make a little heat of our own.
There was a highly sophisticated force field in place.
There's a chamber down this corridor.
Doc, I think his cellular toxicity level is rising.
It's up to 32 percent.
Let's see if we can stabilize those levels.
Get me a cytoplasmic stimulator.
Ah, we don't have one.
Then replicate one.
Yeah.
The design schematics are in the ship's medical data base.
Right.
The man drives a 700,000-ton starship so somebody thinks he'd make a good medic.
I can survive with one lung, can't I?
What if I donated a lung to Neelix?
A transplant is not an option.
No one aboard is a compatible match for a Talaxian.
We're going to need a completely new way to oxygenate his blood supply and relay neuro-electrical impulses.
Our replicators can't produce compatible artificial organs for him, but maybe there's a way to mimic their functions and give us direct control of his respiratory system.
Computer, is there an identification matrix on Mr. Neelix from the last time he used the transporter?
Affirmative.
Transfer it to console 4.
What are you doing?
I'm using the transporter matrix to get exact specifications for Neelix's lungs.
I thought you just said we can't replicate his lungs.
We can't, but if I can reconfigure my emitter array, I might be able to create a pair of holographic lungs for Mr. Neelix.
Holographic lungs?
If it's successful, we can precisely control his pulmonary functions to allow normal breathing.
But a hologram is just a projection of light held in a magnetic containment field.
There's no real matter involved.
Now... you hit me.
The magnetic containment field that creates the illusion of my body can be modulated to allow matter to pass through it or... be stopped.
I might be able to modulate the holographic lungs in the same way, allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass from the lungs to the bloodstream.
I want to know what this means.
What are you going to do to him?
There's no time to explain the exact procedure to you right now.
Oh, well, make the time, because I'm not going to let you perform any experimental surgery on Neelix until I know exactly what you're doing and what the risks are.
The risk is that it won't work.
And if it doesn't, he'll die.
But it is his only immediate chance for survival.
If he does survive, he'll have to be held motionless in an isotropic restraint.
The lungs need to be perfectly aligned to his internal physiology.
The computer won't be able to compensate for any body movement whatsoever.
How long will he have to stay like that?
For the rest of his life, unless the holo-lungs can be replaced by his original organs, and he will never be able to leave the holographic environment of this room.
The holo-lungs would disappear the moment he went out the door.
Kes, I know it sounds pretty grim, but it's better than losing him completely.
This way, he'll still be alive.
And maybe we can find a better solution somewhere down the road.
What do you think Neelix would want?
I'm not sure.
But I do know that I want him to live.
This room is the source of the dilithium signature we detected earlier.
The power systems here are running on an unusual dilithium matrix.
So there are actually no dilithium deposits on this planet?
It would appear not.
Are these organs?
This looks like some kind of storage facility.
I would say you are correct, Captain.
This appears to be a biological repository.
Any sign of Neelix's lungs?
Negative.
There is, however, a Kazon liver, and although I cannot identify the other organs on display here, I would say they bear a striking similarity to pulmonary organs, epidermal tissue, ocular nerve fiber...
Save the cataloging for later, Tuvok.
According to my tricorder, there was a life form in this room less than ten minutes ago.
Captain.
Open it.
One life sign 20 meters ahead.
Let's go.
They've erected a force field with a rotating phase modulation.
We will not be able to disrupt it.
Voyager to Captain Janeway.
Go ahead.
We've just picked up an alien ship leaving the planet.
Tractor them, Commander.
Sorry, Captain.
They went into warp too quickly.
Beam us back.
As soon as we're aboard, lay in a course for pursuit, maximum warp.
Aye, Captain.
Okay... the isotropic restraint is activated.
He won't be able to move more than two microns in any direction.
One micron would be preferable, but I suppose it'll have to do.
lnitiating the holographic emitter array.
His cellular toxicity is rising.
82 percent.
86 percent.
Computer, activate program Neelix-1.
Deactivate the infuser.
It's off-line.
Here we go.
90 percent.
95 percent.
Toxicity returning to normal.
Captain's Log, supplemental.
We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon.
They are not responding to hails, and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed.
Holographic lungs?
Yes.
And they're working perfectly, if I do say so myself.
Try to breathe normally.
How long can I live like this?
I don't know.
This is an unprecedented medical procedure.
We will be closely monitoring your condition.
When do I get out of this restraint?
Unless Captain Janeway is successful in retrieving your original lungs, you'll have to stay in the isotropic restraint indefinitely.
indefinitely?
You mean I... I could be in here the rest of my life?
Yes.
But we're trying to find the aliens that did this to you.
The Captain is doing everything she can.
Well... if I'm going to be in here a while, now's as good a time as any to tell you.
Your ceiling is hideous.
I didn't design the room.
I just work here.
Something with a bit of color would help.
Maybe a nice tapestry or a painting.
Uh, could you dim the lights a little?
I'm a doctor, Mr. Neelix, not a decorator.
Perhaps you would be willing to accommodate his... aesthetic needs.
And some music would be nice.
Or better yet, are you programmed to sing?
Janeway to Paris.
Please report to the Bridge.
I'm on my way, Captain.
You know where l am if you need me.
Thanks for everything.
Oh, fine.
I have a little accident, I lose a pair of lungs, and the next thing I know
Paris is swooping in like a Rectilian vulture.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you hear the way that he said that?
"l'll be on the Bridge if you need me."
"lf you need me."
Neelix...
Why doesn't he just pull the plug on the holographic emitter, and get it over with, get me out of the way, so he can have you all to himself?
Neelix, you're overreacting.
Tom's been very supportive.
Ah, so it's "Tom" now, is it?
You really have nothing to worry about.
We're friends, that's all.
It's not you I'm worried about.
It's him.
He's just... one big hormone walking around the ship.
Don't you see the way that he looks at you?
This is ridiculous.
I am not going to argue with you about something that exists only in your imagination.
I know you, Neelix.
And I know you're afraid.
I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I'll be here with you.
Ke...
Kes... I could be in here a very long time.
You need to go on with your life.
Don't worry about me.
Neelix...
You should just let me die.
Stop that.
We're going to get through this together.
Visiting hours are over.
He needs rest.
When can I come back?
1700 hours, not a minute before.
I'll see you then.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kiss you.
I'm only adjusting the restraint.
I'll try to contain my disappointment.
Captain, we've completed our diagnostic on the alien device.
It appears to be more than a weapon.
It's also a very sophisticated medical scanner and surgical instrument.
From what we can tell, lt uses a neural resonator to stun the victim while a quantum imaging scanner begins a microcellular analysis of the entire body.
The amount of information this thing can gather puts a tricorder to shame.
You fire this at someone, you learn everything about their anatomy, right down to their DNA sequencing.
So it sounds like we're dealing with aliens who've developed a technology specifically designed to locate and extract organs from other beings.
Why?
Captain.
The alien ship has dropped out of warp.
It's approaching a large asteroid.
On screen.
It's entered the asteroid, Captain.
Hold position here.
Mr. Kim?
I can't scan the interior.
The surface stratum is made up of some sort of neutronium alloy.
It doesn't look like a natural formation.
Are you saying someone built this asteroid?
It's possible.
Any sign of weapons or defense systems?
Negative.
I think I've located where the alien ship entered.
There's an open crater on the limb of the asteroid.
Let's see it.
The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside.
How large is that crater?
200 meters in diameter.
Captain, may I suggest you consider carefully what you are about to do.
How do you know what I'm about to do?
I could describe to you in detail the psychological observations I've made about you over the past four years, which lead me to conclude you're about to take this ship inside the asteroid, but suffice it to say
I know you quite well.
One of these days, I'm going to surprise you, Tuvok, but not today.
I've already considered other options.
If Neelix has any chance of surviving, we have to act fast.
Red Alert.
Mr. Paris, lay in a course.
Aye, Captain.
Mr. Tuvok, maximum shields.
Phasers at the ready.
Captain, I'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only.
This passageway is getting a little too narrow for my taste.
Use your discretion, Mr. Paris.
Any sign of the vessel, Lieutenant?
We're still following the ion trail, but electromagnetic interference is limiting our sensor range.
I'm only able to scan 500 meters ahead of us.
Are there any indications we're being scanned or probed, Mr. Kim?
Not yet.
Doctor?
Doctor, I require your assistance.
What is it, Mr. Neelix?
Please, it's urgent.
Yes?
I have an itch.
An itch?
Just above my left eyebrow.
A little higher.
Oh, thank you.
You're quite welcome.
Doctor, wait, don't leave.
I'm not leaving, Mr. Neelix.
I'm simply going back to work.
I can't see you over there.
I...
I feel like I'm all alone.
You are all alone.
I'm a holographic projection-- a projection with a lot of work to do, I might add.
That's very amusing, Doctor.
But... um... I'm really starting to feel a little, uh... trapped in here.
A little claustrophobic maybe.
I'm not sure what to do.
There's nothing you can do except lie there and be quiet.
I'm going to lie here for the rest of my life, aren't I?
Just staring up at the ceiling.
I'm not sure I can take that.
I really need to get out of this restraint.
Doctor, I want you to let me out of this thing right now.
You know that's impossible.
I'm the patient.
I know what my rights are.
I want to be released from this restraint immediately.
lmmediately!
Mr. Neelix, you are alive, you are breathing and for the moment, your condition is stable.
That is more than most people can say in your situation.
Now, it is critical to your recovery that you not subject yourself to any additional stress.
Try to calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You're not the one trapped in a restraining field with holo-lungs.
I don't think they're working.
I can't...
I can't get enough oxygen.
There's something wrong.
You're hyperventilating.
Try to take slow, natural breaths.
I can't.
I'm dying.
Let me out of here.
Will you help me?
Help me.
Help me!
You're doing just fine, Mr. Paris.
Just fine.
Thanks, Captain.
Sensors detect a large chamber ahead.
What the hell?
We appear to be seeing Voyager and the alien ship reflecting off the walls of the chamber.
Can you determine which ship is the real one?
No, Captain.
The walls are emanating severe electromagnetic interference.
I cannot scan them directly.
It's like trying to move through a hall of mirrors.
You never know when you're going to walk into the glass.
I'm still picking up the alien's ion trail.
Maybe we should follow that.
They might have left a fake ion trail to lure us in here.
It could lead us right into one of those walls.
That's a chance we're going to have to take.
Tuvok, extend the deflectors to maximum range.
If we do run into something, it'll give us an extra margin of error.
Follow the ion trail, Mr. Paris, slowly.
Mr. Kim, continuous scans.
Aye, Captain.
I'll do what I can to reassure him, Doctor.
Good. lf you don't mind, I'd like you to remain in Sick Bay, so you're here when he wakes up.
Of course.
Are you all right?
Me?
You seem agitated about something.
Of course I'm agitated.
This entire situation is getting out of control.
You mean Neelix.
First they tell me there's no doctor, so I have to be on call 24 hours a day.
And then they tell me there are no nurses, so I have no one to assist me.
I thought Tom Paris was assigned to you.
Like I said, no one to assist me, and now I have a patient with severe and possibly long-term emotional problems and there's no Counselor on board.
I am an emergency medical supplement-- a supplement, that's all.
I wasn't programmed for any of this.
It's just... unacceptable.
I don't know anything about holographic engineering, but if you want my opinion, you haven't been acceptable.
You've been remarkable.
I've only done what the program allows me to.
Give yourself some credit.
You saved his life.
You did-- not some program.
It may seem that way to you.
That's exactly how it seems.
You're very... kind.
How does a real doctor learn to deal with patients' emotional problems, anyway?
They learn from experience.
Aren't you capable of learning?
I have the capacity to accumulate and process data, yes.
Then I guess you'll just have to learn... like the rest of us.
Have you ever considered a career in medicine?
Neelix is starting to regain consciousness.
Lieutenant, I'm picking up a minor power fluctuation in the warp core.
Compensate with the KLS stabilizer.
No effect.
In fact, the power loss is starting to accelerate.
Janeway to Torres.
What's going on down there?
Some kind of power drain.
I can't localize it, but... we're losing power at a rate of seven percent per minute.
The power drain is coming from somewhere in this chamber, Captain.
Some kind of dampening field.
It's bleeding energy directly from the warp nacelles.
B'Elanna, shut down the warp core.
Go to emergency power.
No effect, Captain.
Keep me informed.
Bridge out.
Can you pinpoint the source of the dampening field?
It appears to be coming from 217 mark 015.
Distance 547 meters.
Tuvok.
What would happen if we locked phasers and fired at the source?
The walls of this chamber reflect directed energy.
The phaser beam would ricochet along an unpredictable path, possibly impacting our ship in the process.
All right.
We won't try that.
Well, maybe we should.
Tuvok, what would happen if we reduced the phaser power level to a minimum setting and sent out a continuous beam?
The phaser would continue to reflect off the bulkheads until it encountered a nonreflective material.
Until it encountered a nonreflective material-- like the real alien ship.
So we could use the phasers like a searchlight... scan the interior of the station until we find the ship.
Exactly.
Do it.
Adjusting phaser azimuth to 15 degrees.
Wait a minute.
I think I've found the real ship.
On screen.
Mr. Paris, bring us within transporter range of that ship.
Aye, Captain.
I'm picking up two life signs.
They're powering engines.
Bridge to Transporter Room 3.
Lock on to those two life signs and beam them aboard.
Security, meet me in Transporter Room 3.
Aye, sir.
You're on the Starship Voyager.
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the United Federation of Planets.
I am Dereth... of the Vidiian Sodality.
You attacked one of our crew members and you lured us into this asteroid.
Why?
We are gathering replacement organs and suitable biomatter.
It is the only way we have to fight the phage.
A virus?
Some kind of disease?
Yes.
It attacked our people over two millennia ago.
It consumes our bodies destroys our genetic codes and cellular structures.
So you harvest the bodies of other beings to replace your own tissues as they're consumed by this... phage?
Our immunotechnology cannot keep up.
The phage adapts.
It resists all attempts to destroy it.
Our society has been ravaged.
Thousands die each day.
There is no other way for us to survive.
I have a great... sympathy for what your race has endured.
But I cannot allow you to keep the organs you removed from one of our crew members.
We need them back immediately.
I'm afraid that isn't possible.
I have already biochemically altered the air-breathing organs and grafted them into Motura's body.
They are a part of him now.
He is my honatta.
His task is to find the organs I need for survival.
We... we try to extract them from the dead...
But sometimes, when the need is immediate more aggressive actions are required.
So now I am left with the same choice you made-- whether to commit murder to save a life, or to allow my own crewman to die while you breathe air through his lungs.
It must be impossible for you to understand how any civilized people could come to... this.
Before the phage began, we were known as educators and explorers-- a people whose greatest achievements were artistic.
I, myself, am a sculptor of note on my world.
All I can say is that when your entire existence is at stake...
You don't have to explain yourself, Motura.
If the consequence of this act is a death sentence, so be it.
At least it will put an end to my suffering.
I can't begin to understand what your people have gone through.
They may have found a way to ignore the moral implications of what you're doing, but I have no such luxury.
I don't have the freedom to kill you to save another.
My culture finds that to be a reprehensible and entirely unacceptable act.
If we were closer to home, I would lock you up and turn you over to my authorities for trial but I don't even have that ability here, and I am not prepared to carry you forever in our brig.
So I see no other alternative... but to let you go.
Take a message to your people.
If I ever encounter your kind again, I will do whatever is necessary to protect my people from this...
harvesting of yours.
Any aggressive actions against this ship or its crew will be met by the deadliest force.
is that clear?
Uh... quite.
Wait.
I want to see this crewman of yours.
That can serve no useful purpose.
Maybe it can.
Our medical technologies may be superior to theirs.
I can tell you, from what we've observed of them, that they are considerably superior.
She spared my life-- our lives.
We owe it to them to see if there's anything we can do to help him.
I'll take you to him.
His simulated organs are primitive.
It's amazing he is still alive.
This is set to scan only.
Proceed... carefully.
Strange.
According to my readings, you are not here.
Believe me, I wish I weren't.
The rest of you are healthy.
You are compatible for organ transplant.
Wait a minute.
We've already considered this.
Talaxian physiology is different from that of anyone else on this ship.
His immune system would reject their lungs immediately.
Your surgical knowledge is inferior.
We will simply adapt his immunogenicity.
It won't be a problem.
Which of you will donate a lung?
Me.
No!
Absolutely not.
It's too dangerous.
Let someone else do it.
No, I want to do it, Neelix.
I'm willing to take the risk.
Besides, you've done so much for me.
Let me give you something once.
Just for once.
All right.
I look forward to sampling your cooking, Mr. Neelix.
You mean I can keep my kitchen?
Well, at least until we get the replicators back on line.
Thank you, Captain.
And, Captain... I'll see you at breakfast.
Captain's Log, supplemental.
The aliens have successfully transplanted one of Kes's lungs into Neelix.
The dampening field has been deactivated, and I have allowed them to beam back to their vessel.
We are resuming a course home.
It's all right.
The operation was a success.
Neelix is asleep and breathing on his own now... with your lung.
I feel a little light-headed.
That will pass.
You'll soon adapt to diminished lung capacity.
I spoke to the Captain about you.
She's given me permission to begin training you as a medical assistant.
You'll be a backup for Mr. Paris or, possibly, a replacement.
That is, assuming you're interested.
Of course I'm interested.
When do we start?
We'll begin your lessons as soon as you've fully recovered.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
You've... given me a lot to think about.
Previously on Lois Clark:
Excuse me, is one of you Clark Kent?
Mayson Drake, deputy DA.
No matter what happens, I'll never lose Clark.
I love you.
You're not the only case I'm working on.
Mayson!
No!
Resurrection.
Oh, my God.
Life is but a journey.
The road may be long the road may be short.
In the case of Mayson Drake, it was tragically short.
Let us pray.
"Into your hands, Oh, Lord, we commend thy faithful servant, Mayson Drake.
Receive her into the arms of thy mercy and to the blessed rest of everlasting peace.
Amen."
You realize that getting rid of Mayson Drake solves only half our problems.
If that pill she got her hands on is found by the wrong people...
- We're looking for it, sir.
- I don't want looking, I want finding.
Are you okay?
The last thing she said to me was "resurrection."
What was she trying to tell me?
Maybe you'd like a few minutes alone.
I'll meet you at the car.
Clark!
Clark!
Sorry, Mr. Gables.
- A little mistake with the original dosage.
- "A little mistake"?
If Resurrection is to succeed I can't afford any more dead friends waking up.
Now that's good.
Watch out.
- Shut her down.
- Hey!
Wait.
Stop.
- You got a problem, lady?
- That body you just buried, it's still alive.
It opened its eyes and it looked at me.
No, I know what I saw.
Stop!
Lady, they don't pay me enough for this aggravation.
- It's still alive.
- Look I got a work order to plant this guy in 29-B.
Now, unless I get a court order telling me not to, I'm planting him.
- But, Clark!
- Lois.
Lois, come on.
You probably just imagined it.
Come on, think about this.
We've all been under a lot of stress lately.
So let's just go back to the office, okay?
Come on, come on.
After death, it's not uncommon for a body to have involuntary movements, Lois.
Fine.
Never happened.
Lois my car is in the shop.
Could I borrow your car tonight?
I met this incredible girl this morning...
This morning?
At Mayson's funeral?
That's so tacky.
It didn't start out that way.
Honest.
It just happened.
I thought Angela was the love of your life?
- Yesterday's news.
- Well, that didn't take long.
I'm young.
I'm single.
I gotta keep my options open, Lois.
She left me for a guy with a Ferrari.
Are you happy?
Can I borrow the car, please?
Tell you what.
I'll lend you my car if you call Perpetual Pines and find out who they just buried in plot 29-B.
Deal.
29-B?
How are you doing, son?
Clark?
Okay, I guess.
- How's the story coming?
- Slow.
I can't seem to get a handle on it.
I don't know what's wrong.
You need a couple of days off, you let me know.
Okay?
Oh, there's a federal DEA agent coming down here this afternoon.
He's looking into Mayson's death.
Maybe he can help you with your investigation.
Why's the DEA involved?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe they think it's Mob-related.
You know, Mayson had a lot of enemies in the Intergang.
I could get in her office, look at her files...
No, the police have got it cordoned off.
Well, but then when has a little police tape ever stopped you two, huh?
This shouldn't take long.
I could get into any door in this city.
I know, and that worries me.
Find some connection to Intergang, or what she meant by "resurrection." It would be something she was working on recently.
Well, here's something she received the day before she died.
It's a file on somebody named Stanley Gables.
Anything on Intergang or resurrection?
- No.
- Well, keep looking.
Well, how's this for recent?
It's still warm.
A meatball sandwich?
Molanaro's.
Best in the city.
Go ahead, take a bite.
They've got peppers that'll knock your socks off.
- Who are you?
- The cleaning man.
Who are you?
The cleaning woman.
How's that for a coincidence?
We're all cleaners.
Guess the agency overbooked.
You know I'm a very sensitive guy.
I just hate it when people lie to me.
But you don't mind lying yourself.
Touché.
But I've got the gun, so my lie takes precedence.
Unless you're Superman, I wouldn't recommend it.
Please, don't get the wrong impression.
I really am a fun guy.
You should see me at parties.
You know, you have the most incredible eyes.
Well, it's been real.
And don't forget, check out Molanaro's, when you're not so tied up.
Guess he was never a Boy Scout.
His eyes were beady.
Beady and shifty.
I wouldn't say shifty exactly.
They were soft and warm.
They were beady.
Thin lips, hard-set jaw.
I don't think hard.
I think chiseled and his lips, they did this cute little thing where they curled up when he smiled.
Who's that supposed to be, Pinocchio?
Hey, I'm an editorial cartoonist.
You want a portrait, get a camera.
Lois.
Clark.
In my office now.
Agent Scardino, this is Lois Lane and Clark Kent.
- You?
- You?
- Small world.
- You all know each other?
Agent Scardino?
Oh, please.
Call me Daniel.
- Do you always leave by the window?
- I left my macaroni salad on the roof.
Why didn't you identify yourself?
What, and spoil all our fun?
I don't remember you or Miss Lane here whipping out any press credentials either.
Obviously, I've missed something here.
Is there a problem?
There is if Agent Scardino is Washington's idea of solving Mayson's murder.
Washington had nothing to do with this.
In fact, they suggested I keep my distance.
They have this crazy idea I'm some kind of loose cannon.
I wonder where they would get such a crazy idea like that.
If you're not here officially, why are you here?
Because I know who designed the bomb that killed Mayson Drake.
A con by the name of Sean Macarthy.
That guy who was responsible for that series of drug-related bombings in '89?
The same.
I lost someone very close to me in one of those bombings.
I thought Macarthy died in prison three weeks ago.
So they say.
Hit on the DA says otherwise.
I know Macarthy's m.o. Like the back of my hand.
I was the one that put him in prison.
Somehow, he's out there again.
So your idea of solving Mayson's murder is looking for a dead man?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
So if you come across any information that might help I'd appreciate you letting me know.
I'm staying at the Bristol.
Please, don't take this the wrong way, but are those eyelashes real?
Of course they're real.
Boy, they're pretty.
Agent Scardino, let me show you the way out over here.
Just show him to a window, chief.
I'm sure he'll climb out.
Can you believe that guy?
Who does he think he is, Mel Gibson?
- I don't know.
I think he's kind of cute.
- Give me a break.
So, what are you looking for?
Sean Macarthy's obituary, since he's the only lead we have.
Here it is.
He died of natural causes.
He's survived by his mother Colleen Macarthy.
That's a picture of Sean when he was 10.
We took that the day before he blew up the garage.
Look at those dimples.
He was such a cute little boy.
You know, Sean was actually responsible for me taking up needlepoint.
When he went to prison, I had to figure out some way to support myself.
Now I sell these at swap meets.
Now, that's the last picture ever taken of Sean two weeks before he died.
Isn't he adorable?
Mrs. Macarthy, did Sean have any friends?
Only one that I know of.
They were pen pals.
- They wrote to each other?
- Heavens, no.
They met in the pen.
You know, I think that he might've mentioned him in one of these letters that he wrote me from prison.
Tea's ready.
I'll be right back.
Have a look.
This one was sent the day before he died.
"This is probably the last letter I will be writing you from prison.
If you don't hear from me, don't worry, just know that I'm in a far better place."
Sounds like a man who knew he was gonna die.
Lois, I'm gonna go wash up real quick.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna wash up.
Superman, what happened?
I was in the area when I spotted this.
It would've burned this entire house down.
Oh, my.
We're very grateful to you, Superman.
Would you like a cookie?
No, thank you, ma'am.
I'm watching my calories.
Bye-bye, now.
My, he's quite a big boy.
- What happened?
- Somebody tried to burn down the house.
But that sexy Superman fella was in the area and he saved us.
I'm a bit weak in the knees.
I think I better go lie down for a while.
Would you mind if we kept these for a few days?
Be my guest.
They'd be safer with you.
How's your seaweed, sir?
Disgusting.
Oh, I know, sir.
But you do need your iodine and B6.
Listen to this, Albie.
"Brilliant scientist invents new diet pill."
I suppose STAR Labs will give him, what, a blue ribbon and a new car?
All they gave me was a pink slip.
- For one little mistake.
- Hey, I didn't make a mistake, they did.
Oh, absolutely, sir.
It's just that you did mention to me that STAR Labs hadn't authorized the experiment you were working on.
You don't achieve greatness by playing by the rules!
With all due respect, sir, I don't know if the four technicians who died of the Alpha virus would feel the same.
What about my pain, huh?
Every day, this virus eats away another piece of me.
So don't think I don't know about sacrifice.
Mr. Gables, I don't wish to upset you any further but we did run into a little snag with the letters.
Tell me they were destroyed.
No.
Superman showed up.
- I'm hyperventilating, Albie.
- Please, Mr. Gables the stress is very bad for you.
Why don't we just rethink the whole idea.
I tried the legal system and it failed me.
The people of Metropolis have spoken and now they're gonna suffer the same way I am.
I thought that it was STAR Labs that you wanted to hurt.
You mean, you want to kill everybody in Metropolis?
If I just wanted to destroy STAR Labs, Albie I would've burned it to the ground.
I wouldn't have invented the Resurrection pill and gathered the three best criminals in the world.
Which reminds me, we have work to do.
- You needed something, Mr. Gables?
- Yes, Mr. Macarthy, I do.
- Lois?
- It's open, Clark.
I picked up some books from the library.
Bartlett's Quotations, Jung's Collective Unconscious, Tolstoy.
Anything with any reference to resurrection.
- Hope you're hungry.
- Get anything from the letters?
No, not yet.
But I'm only halfway through them.
You probably haven't eaten all day.
Here, I made these.
Too much curry.
I knew it.
Do you want some wine?
Lois, is there any reason why we're not getting down to work here?
Actually, there is.
I wanted to ask you something.
I need to know if I'm yesterday's news.
- What?
- You know.
Stale, old.
I mean, it's been a week since our first date and our first kiss.
You haven't said a word about it.
It's like it never happened.
Lois, I'm sorry if it feels like I've been ignoring you lately, but...
Just a second.
- Hi.
- Agent Scardino.
- Call me Daniel.
May I come in?
- Well...
Sorry to drop in like this, but I was thinking maybe if we start working together...
Look who's here.
If it isn't the man with the smoldering eyes.
What are you talking about?
Mayson's diary.
Pretty steamy stuff.
Read like an Emily Brontë novel.
You read Emily Brontë?
Well, what can I say.
I'm a hopeless romantic.
Rumaki.
My favorite.
Too much curry.
It's perfect.
I like it spicy.
Anyway, Kent.
She wrote some really passionate purple prose, mainly about you.
And you said you were just friends.
You holding out on me, Kent?
Well, Clark was probably the only person in Metropolis that didn't know that Mayson was madly in love with him.
Who's holding out on who, Scardino?
You took the diary.
I'm willing to share.
You work with me, I'll work with you.
Now, what have you got for me?
Well, the last word Mayson said before she died was, "Resurrection."
The last entry in her diary was:
"Resurrection equals Macarthy" with a question mark.
- Daily Planet, how may I direct your call?
- Hi, Clark.
- Where you been?
- Checking on Wild Man Scardino.
Turns out that he's been on probation more than any other DEA agent.
Anything else?
Yeah, he's also their most decorated agent.
- Still reading Macarthy's letters?
- Yeah.
I've been thinking about this last letter he wrote about being in a better place.
What if he wasn't talking about the hereafter.
What if he was just talking about a better place outside the prison walls.
So you're saying you think he faked his own death?
- Dan says that the bomb...
- Wait.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
Now it's "Dan"?
What is with you?
What is so bad about him?
What is so good about him?
A lot of things.
Okay, he's a little different.
Anyway, he said that the bomb that killed Mayson could only have been built by Macarthy.
- Lf that's true...
- Okay, I'll play along.
So maybe we should pay Macarthy's pen pal a visit.
I already made an appointment.
The guy's name is Big Buster Williams.
You'd better take a look at these.
The camera at the police impound caught this guy, poking around the remains of Mayson's car.
He ran off before they could catch him, though.
This is the guy I saw buried alive at Mayson's funeral.
It does look like him.
I mean, how you described him to look.
But we saw the coffin buried.
I don't get it.
I don't either.
But if he's interested in Mayson's car, so am I.
Officer Highland to the Police Impound Office.
What do you think we're looking for?
I don't know.
Officer Caplan, bay three.
Lois, could you hand me a nail file?
Why do men always assume that women have nail files with them?
I'm sorry.
But do you have a nail file?
Actually, I do.
But only because it's part of my pocket knife.
Officer Frank, please call squad commander.
Sergeant Lever, report to bay two.
Hey, what made you think to look in there?
The French Connection.
It was Mayson's favorite movie.
Really?
Nice work.
See the basement?
STAR Labs has a subzero chamber there.
That's where they store the virus.
So how do we get to it?
There's an air vent that leads directly to the chamber.
Exactly what makes this virus so special?
It's airborne.
It's lethal.
And there's no cure.
Anyone who comes in contact with it will die a very painful death.
Except for us, of course.
Of course.
You'll be wearing protective masks.
This air vent is pretty narrow.
- Nobody in this room is gonna fit.
- That's right.
We're still missing one member of our team.
Your old cellmate.
You mean Buster?
Albie's gonna take a little trip today.
Sir, are you sure there isn't any other way we can get even with Metropolis?
Getting cold feet, Albie?
No.
No, no, sir.
No.
It's just...
Well, exposing everyone to a lethal virus seems I don't know, a little severe.
Nobody cared about my life!
I did.
Oh, yes.
Yes, you did.
Big deal.
Did Professor Hamilton say how long it's gonna take to analyze that pill?
We should have the results sometime this afternoon.
How do I look?
Appropriately cheap.
Just let me do most of the talking.
You usually do.
Excuse me.
We're here to see Buster Williams.
Hey, Buster, you got another visitor.
That's Big Buster Williams.
Hey, Buster.
Macarthy was right.
You're the best-looking guy in the joint.
Hi, I'm Angel.
Macarthy's old lady.
This is my brother, Spike.
That's some killer outfit.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Macarthy never told me he had a doll.
Well, you know him.
He never talked much.
You kidding?
Motor Mouth Macarthy?
So did he send you to fill me in on the job?
The job?
You want a glass of water or something?
No thanks, Spike.
I'm okay.
He's dead.
I guess that really is a killer outfit.
Oh, my God.
Lois.
I got that info you want on that guy buried in plot 29-B.
Diego Martinez, serving 20 years for bank robbery.
He's an expert at getting past security systems, except the last time.
It says that he was in good health and died suddenly.
Cause unknown.
There wasn't an autopsy.
The prison infirmary says they send the bodies directly out to the cemeteries.
What's that?
The report on that pill we found in Mayson's car.
It's a form of synthetic barbiturate that can:
"Induce a temporary state of suspended animation."
Why would somebody wanna kill Mayson over this?
Clark, this is gonna sound kind of out there.
But what if Mayson found out somebody was using this pill to get criminals out of prison by making it appear as if they died.
That is out there but it's also a great way to break out.
Who would look for you if you were dead?
But the cemetery would have to be in on it.
I'm feeling a sudden urge to plan a funeral.
Who would want to spend eternity in that?
Someone who had their eyes closed.
So sorry to keep you waiting.
I am Mr. Sunshine.
Please, accept my condolences at this difficult time.
Was the dear departed a relative?
- My uncle.
- My aunt.
He...
He was a cross-dresser.
At the time of his death, we weren't sure what he...
She was.
I see.
We have questions.
Could we go to your office?
I carry my office with me.
This way we don't waste any valuable ground.
When you're a cemetery, use of space is very important.
Now, I have only three words to say:
Location, location, location.
The plot is everything.
I see.
Well, actually, I was interested in caskets.
Could you show me that one?
Well, those are the economy models but if you insist.
Quite frankly, they offer very little moisture protection.
They're just slightly better than a sandwich bag.
What about that one?
Ah, our Happy Trails model.
An excellent choice.
One-hundred-percent moisture-proof and silk-lined.
Cotton tends to wrinkle so.
Don't you agree?
I think we have to talk it over, but thank you very much.
Of course.
Check around, kick a few handles.
And when you're ready to buy, we'll be here.
Looky-loos.
All three of the prisoner's funerals were paid for by a man named Albie Swinson.
I'll call Jimmy, see what he can find out.
I'll meet you at 29-B.
If somebody is digging these guys up, maybe I can find evidence.
Lois, you okay?
Yeah, thanks to Agent Scardino.
Please, call me Daniel.
Lucky you were nearby.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, how did you know?
That you'd be here?
I don't know.
I guess we just think alike.
Well, I guess you don't need me.
Funny, I thought he'd be friendlier than that.
Yeah, I wonder what's with him.
Anyway, I should probably go find Clark.
Hold it.
Someone just tried to kill you.
I think you've had enough cemeteries for a while, young lady.
"Young lady"?
Haven't been called that since I went to the prom and I didn't bring the car home.
I just saw Superman fly off.
Are you okay?
I am perfectly fine.
Talk some sense into your partner.
Someone tried to run her down.
She needs protection.
- Do you want me to take you home?
- No offense, but as a federal agent I'm more qualified to offer protection.
- Scardino, no offense, but as her partner...
- Hold it, both of you.
I am perfectly capable of protecting myself.
Now I am going home alone.
Way to go, Kent.
Wait, wait, wait!
- Wait, wait!
- Scardino?
Please call me Daniel.
What do you mean, breaking into my house?
Lois, as much as I fantasized about being in this position with you you're crushing my legs.
Look, I'm sorry.
I rang the bell, you didn't answer.
I was drying my hair.
I just got out of the shower.
Yeah, I can see that.
I cannot believe I defended you to Clark.
He was right.
You are crazy.
I don't answer the doorbell, so you come from the roof?
I was worried about you, okay?
Sean Macarthy is an animal.
For all I know he was trying to kill you.
Just what do the words, "I do not need you to protect me," mean to you?
Look, I already lost one woman I cared about to Macarthy.
It is not gonna happen again.
You got it?
Who was she?
My partner, Jenna.
She was bright, sensitive.
A little mouthy sometimes, but then I'm not exactly a monk.
And Macarthy was the bomber?
Excuse me.
Clark?
What are you doing here?
I know it's late.
But I found out Albie Swinson works for a man named Stanley Gables.
Ring a bell?
Gables.
Yeah, that was the name on the file on Mayson's desk.
Oh, there's more.
According to the prison sign-in sheet, Albie visited Big Buster, Martinez and Macarthy on the days that each one of them "died."
- What do you think of that?
- Fascinating.
And well told too.
Of course, you're a writer, so you're good with words.
Agent Scardino just dropped by to chat about the case.
That must have been some chat for you to need to shower.
- See you later.
- Clark.
I think you better go.
Okay.
But I'm not going far.
- Hello?
- Miss Lane?
My name is Albie Swinson.
You've gotta help me.
Albie Swinson?
Please, the toxins in his body are poisoning his mind.
He's going to kill innocent people.
Who, Gables?
I can't say any more on the telephone.
Meet me at Perpetual Pines, plot 29-B, in half an hour.
Oh, Albie, Albie.
You disappoint me.
Hi, this is Clark.
I'm not home.
Please leave a message and I will call you as soon as I can.
Thanks.
Clark, where are you at 5 a.m.?
Okay, I don't have time to explain.
Just meet me at Perpetual Pines.
Clark!
I thought I was the only one who came in with the roosters.
I had a lot of research to do on a guy named Stanley Gables, chief.
We think he might be tied in to Mayson's death.
Gables?
Gables.
I know that name.
Wasn't that the fellow that used to work for STAR Labs?
One of their top chemists.
He created something called the Alpha virus.
Right.
He had an accident in his lab, and that virus killed four people.
Yeah, apparently it wasn't authorized, so they fired him.
Then he sued, blaming STAR Labs for the accident.
Oh, yeah.
I remember.
Jury didn't buy it.
In fact, we ran an editorial praising the verdict.
You know, this guy just wouldn't take responsibility for his own mistakes.
- Something wrong?
- I wanted to tell Lois to meet me at Gables' house, but she's not answering.
Where could she be at this hour?
- Where's Albie?
- Albie couldn't make it.
Guess I'll just have to go jogging alone this morning.
I don't think so.
Sorry.
Yeah.
All right, there it is.
All right.
Come on, let's do it.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Ready?
Easy.
- Put it down easy, in these brackets.
- Looks good.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, I'm alive in here!
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
I must have really died because, Angel, this is heaven.
Casket transport in progress.
Gentlemen, I believe Buster is about to arrive.
Casket transport complete.
Man, this is heavy.
I thought you said Buster was a little guy.
Now, what are you doing in there?
Would you honestly believe anything I say?
No.
Miss Lane, I presume?
My man in the cemetery was baffled at your disappearance.
It was a unique escape plan, I give you that.
I could return the compliment.
Mr. Macarthy.
I believe love seats were made for two.
Well, gentlemen, our team is now complete.
- Hello, Kent.
- Where's Lois?
She's in bed, like any normal person at 6 in the morning.
Hey, did you bring me a doughnut?
She's gone.
And what are you doing here, anyway?
I slept on the fire escape.
You know, in case she needed me.
She must have snuck out when I went down to the gas station to use the...
Yeah, that fine.
What do you know about Stanley Gables?
Just what you said about him last night.
You don't think that Lois went down to see him by herself?
One thing you should know.
She's very...
Bold.
Headstrong.
Unpredictable.
- To say the least.
- Woman after my own heart.
Check camera two right there, will you?
Bad news.
You got bugs.
Got to spray.
Looks pretty quiet to me.
Why don't you go around back, see if you can find an open door.
This one's open.
After you.
Security systems are down.
- Put the bomb right on the freezer lock.
- Gotcha.
You're sure you know how to get to the subzero chamber?
Just be on the roof in five minutes.
- Where's Gables?
- STAR Labs.
He's going to release the Alpha virus into the atmosphere.
I'm gonna try to find a phone and call the police.
Buster always delivers.
Everybody loves a good Stephen King novel.
Now the city's got to live one.
I don't usually hurt people on purpose, but for the killer of Mayson Drake I might make an exception.
Don't go far.
There's nothing more you can do to me beyond what STAR Labs has already done.
Justice will be served.
It's not justice when innocent people are made to suffer for your mistakes.
Yes, it is.
Get away from me!
No!
No.
You should've died with your partner, Scardino.
Please, call him Daniel.
Quite a story, kids.
I'd give my set of gold-plated Elvis spoons to know what makes a guy like Gables tick.
Well, that's the way it is today.
Everybody sees themself as a victim.
It's like nobody takes responsibility for their actions anymore.
Well, I, for one, take responsibility for mine.
Right now, I got a paper to put to bed so I can get out of here in time to have a little candlelight dinner with Alice.
Night, Perry.
- Night.
- Night, chief.
So, Lois, you wanna go see a movie or something?
Yeah.
That sounds nice.
Something funny.
Okay, I'll call and see what's playing.
Hi.
Hi.
I just came by to thank you for what you did.
Oh, that's okay.
And also to ask you a question.
What would you say if I asked you out sometime?
Are you asking me out?
I didn't say that.
I said, "What would you say if I did?"
I don't know.
Tell you what.
The agency is keeping me around Metropolis for a while.
Why don't you think about what you might say and we'll talk.
Well looks like you have some choices to make.
Previously on Lois Clark:
Excuse me, is one of you Clark Kent?
Mayson Drake, deputy DA.
No matter what happens, I'll never lose Clark.
I love you.
You're not the only case I'm working on.
Mayson!
No!
Resurrection.
Oh, my God.
Life is but a journey.
The road may be long the road may be short.
In the case of Mayson Drake, it was tragically short.
Let us pray.
"Into your hands, Oh, Lord we commend thy faithful servant, Mayson Drake.
Receive her into the arms of thy mercy and to the blessed rest of everlasting peace.
Amen. "
You realize that getting rid of Mayson Drake solves only half our problems.
If that pill she got her hands on is found by the wrong people...
- We're looking for it, sir.
- I don't want looking, I want finding.
Are you okay?
The last thing she said to me was "resurrection. "
What was she trying to tell me?
Maybe you'd like a few minutes alone.
I'll meet you at the car.
Clark!
Clark!
Sorry, Mr. Gables.
- A little mistake with the original dosage.
- "A little mistake"?
If Resurrection is to succeed I can't afford any more dead friends waking up.
Now that's good.
Watch out.
- Shut her down.
- Hey!
Wait.
Stop.
- You got a problem, lady?
- That body you just buried, it's still alive.
It opened its eyes and it looked at me.
No, I know what I saw.
Stop!
They don't pay me enough for this aggravation.
- It's still alive.
- Look I got a work order to plant this guy in 29-B.
Now, unless I get a court order telling me not to, I'm planting him.
- But, Clark!
- Lois.
Lois, come on.
You probably just imagined it.
Come on, think about this.
We've all been under a lot of stress lately.
So let's just go back to the office, okay?
Come on, come on.
After death, it's not uncommon for a body to have involuntary movements.
Fine.
Never happened.
Lois my car is in the shop.
Could I borrow your car tonight?
I met this incredible girl this morning...
This morning?
At Mayson's funeral?
That's so tacky.
It didn't start out that way.
Honest.
It just happened.
I thought Angela was the love of your life?
- Yesterday's news.
- Well, that didn't take long.
I'm young.
I'm single.
I gotta keep my options open, Lois.
She left me for a guy with a Ferrari.
Are you happy?
Can I borrow the car, please?
Tell you what.
I'll lend you my car if you call Perpetual Pines and find out who they just buried in plot 29-B.
Deal.
29-B?
How are you doing, son?
Clark?
Okay, I guess.
- How's the story coming?
- Slow.
I can't seem to get a handle on it.
I don't know what's wrong.
You need a couple of days off, you let me know.
Okay?
Oh, there's a federal DEA agent coming down here this afternoon.
He's looking into Mayson's death.
Maybe he can help you with your investigation.
Why's the DEA involved?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe they think it's Mob-related.
You know, Mayson had a lot of enemies in the Intergang.
I could get in her office, look at her files...
No, the police have got it cordoned off.
Well, but then when has a little police tape ever stopped you two, huh?
This shouldn't take long.
I could get into any door in this city.
I know, and that worries me.
Find some connection to Intergang, or what she meant by "resurrection. "
It would be something she was working on recently.
Well, here's something she received the day before she died.
It's a file on somebody named Stanley Gables.
Anything on Intergang or resurrection?
- No.
- Well, keep looking.
Well, how's this for recent?
It's still warm.
A meatball sandwich?
Molanaro's.
Best in the city.
Go ahead, take a bite.
They've got peppers that'll knock your socks off.
- Who are you?
- The cleaning man.
Who are you?
The cleaning woman.
How's that for a coincidence?
We're all cleaners.
Guess the agency overbooked.
You know I'm a very sensitive guy.
I just hate it when people lie to me.
But you don't mind lying yourself.
Touché.
But I've got the gun, so my lie takes precedence.
Unless you're Superman, I wouldn't recommend it.
Please, don't get the wrong impression.
I really am a fun guy.
You should see me at parties.
You know, you have the most incredible eyes.
Well, it's been real.
And don't forget, check out Molanaro's, when you're not so tied up.
Guess he was never a Boy Scout.
His eyes were beady.
Beady and shifty.
I wouldn't say shifty exactly.
They were soft and warm.
They were beady.
Thin lips, hard-set jaw.
I don't think hard.
I think chiseled and his lips, they did this cute thing where they curled up when he smiled.
Who's that supposed to be, Pinocchio?
Hey, I'm an editorial cartoonist.
You want a portrait, get a camera.
Lois.
Clark.
In my office now.
Agent Scardino, this is Lois Lane and Clark Kent.
- You?
- You?
- Small world.
- You all know each other?
Agent Scardino?
Oh, please.
Call me Daniel.
- Do you always leave by the window?
- I left my macaroni salad on the roof.
Why didn't you identify yourself?
What, and spoil all our fun?
I don't remember you or Miss Lane here whipping out any credentials either.
Obviously, I've missed something here.
Is there a problem?
There is if Scardino is Washington's idea of solving Mayson's murder.
Washington had nothing to do with this.
In fact, they suggested I keep my distance.
They have this crazy idea I'm some kind of loose cannon.
I wonder where they would get such a crazy idea like that.
If you're not here officially, why are you here?
Because I know who designed the bomb that killed Mayson Drake.
A con by the name of Sean Macarthy.
That guy who was responsible for that series of drug-related bombings in '89?
The same.
I lost someone very close to me in one of those bombings.
I thought Macarthy died in prison three weeks ago.
So they say.
Hit on the DA says otherwise.
I know Macarthy's m.o. like the back of my hand.
I was the one that put him in prison.
Somehow, he's out there again.
So your idea of solving Mayson's murder is looking for a dead man?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
So if you come across any information that might help I'd appreciate you letting me know.
I'm staying at the Bristol.
Please, don't take this the wrong way, but are those eyelashes real?
Of course they're real.
Boy, they're pretty.
Agent Scardino, let me show you the way out over here.
Just show him to a window, chief.
I'm sure he'll climb out.
Can you believe that guy?
Who does he think he is, Mel Gibson?
- I don't know.
I think he's kind of cute.
- Give me a break.
So, what are you looking for?
Sean Macarthy's obituary, since he's the only lead we have.
Here it is.
He died of natural causes.
He's survived by his mother Colleen Macarthy.
That's a picture of Sean when he was 10.
We took that the day before he blew up the garage.
Look at those dimples.
He was such a cute little boy.
You know, Sean was actually responsible for me taking up needlepoint.
When he went to prison, I had to figure out some way to support myself.
Now I sell these at swap meets.
Now, that's the last picture ever taken of Sean two weeks before he died.
Isn't he adorable?
Mrs. Macarthy, did Sean have any friends?
Only one that I know of.
They were pen pals.
- They wrote to each other?
- Heavens, no.
They met in the pen.
You know, I think that he might've mentioned him in one of these letters that he wrote me from prison.
Tea's ready.
I'll be right back.
Have a look.
This one was sent the day before he died.
"This is probably the last letter I will be writing you from prison.
If you don't hear from me, don't worry, just know that I'm in a far better place. "
Sounds like a man who knew he was gonna die.
Lois, I'm gonna go wash up real quick.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna wash up.
Superman, what happened?
I was in the area when I spotted this.
It would've burned this entire house down.
Oh, my.
We're very grateful to you, Superman.
Would you like a cookie?
No, thank you, ma'am.
I'm watching my calories.
Bye-bye, now.
My, he's quite a big boy.
- What happened?
- Somebody tried to burn the house.
But that sexy Superman fella was in the area and he saved us.
I'm a bit weak in the knees.
I think I better go lie down for a while.
Would you mind if we kept these for a few days?
Be my guest.
They'd be safer with you.
How's your seaweed, sir?
Disgusting.
Oh, I know, sir.
But you do need your iodine and B6.
Listen to this, Albie.
"Brilliant scientist invents new diet pill. "
I suppose STAR Labs will give him, what, a blue ribbon and a new car?
All they gave me was a pink slip.
- For one little mistake.
- Hey, I didn't make a mistake, they did.
Oh, absolutely, sir.
It's just that you did mention to me that STAR Labs hadn't authorized the experiment you were working on.
You don't achieve greatness by playing by the rules!
With all due respect, sir, I don't know if the four technicians who died of the Alpha virus would feel the same.
What about my pain, huh?
Every day, this virus eats away another piece of me.
So don't think I don't know about sacrifice.
Mr. Gables, I don't wish to upset you any further but we did run into a little snag with the letters.
Tell me they were destroyed.
No.
Superman showed up.
- I'm hyperventilating, Albie.
- Please, Mr. Gables the stress is very bad for you.
Why don't we just rethink the whole idea.
I tried the legal system and it failed me.
The people of Metropolis have spoken and now they're gonna suffer the same way I am.
I thought that it was STAR Labs that you wanted to hurt.
You mean, you want to kill everybody in Metropolis?
If I just wanted to destroy STAR Labs, Albie I would've burned it to the ground.
I wouldn't have invented the Resurrection pill and gathered the three best criminals in the world.
Which reminds me, we have work to do.
- You needed something, Mr. Gables?
- Yes, Mr. Macarthy, I do.
- Lois?
- It's open, Clark.
I picked up some books from the library.
Bartlett's Quotations, Jung's Collective Unconscious, Tolstoy.
Anything with any reference to resurrection.
- Hope you're hungry.
- Get anything from the letters?
No, not yet.
But I'm only halfway through them.
You probably haven't eaten all day.
Here, I made these.
Too much curry.
I knew it.
Do you want some wine?
Lois, is there any reason why we're not getting down to work here?
Actually, there is.
I wanted to ask you something.
I need to know if I'm yesterday's news.
- What?
- You know.
Stale, old.
I mean, it's been a week since our first date and our first kiss.
You haven't said a word about it.
It's like it never happened.
Lois, I'm sorry if it feels like I've been ignoring you lately, but...
Just a second.
- Hi.
- Agent Scardino.
- Call me Daniel.
May I come in?
- Well...
Sorry to drop in like this, but I was thinking maybe if we start working together...
Look who's here.
If it isn't the man with the smoldering eyes.
What are you talking about?
Mayson's diary.
Pretty steamy stuff.
Read like an Emily Brontë novel.
You read Emily Brontë?
Well, what can I say.
I'm a hopeless romantic.
Rumaki.
My favorite.
Too much curry.
It's perfect.
I like it spicy.
Kent.
She wrote some really passionate purple prose, mainly about you.
And you said you were just friends.
You holding out on me, Kent?
Well, Clark was probably the only person in Metropolis that didn't know that Mayson was madly in love with him.
Who's holding out on who, Scardino?
You took the diary.
I'm willing to share.
You work with me, I'll work with you.
Now, what have you got for me?
Well, the last word Mayson said before she died was, "Resurrection. "
The last entry in her diary was:
"Resurrection equals Macarthy" with a question mark.
- Daily Planet, how may I direct your call?
- Hi, Clark.
- Where you been?
- Checking on Wild Man Scardino.
Turns out that he's been on probation more than any other DEA agent.
Anything else?
Yeah, he's also their most decorated agent.
- Still reading Macarthy's letters?
- Yeah.
I've been thinking about this last letter he wrote about being in a better place.
What if he wasn't talking about the hereafter.
What if he was just talking about a better place outside the prison walls.
So you're saying you think he faked his own death?
- Dan says that the bomb...
- Wait.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
Now it's "Dan"?
What is with you?
What is so bad about him?
What is so good about him?
A lot of things.
Okay, he's a little different.
Anyway, he said that the bomb that killed Mayson could only have been built by Macarthy.
- If that's true...
- Okay, I'll play along.
So maybe we should pay Macarthy's pen pal a visit.
I already made an appointment.
The guy's name is Big Buster Williams.
You'd better take a look at these.
The camera at the police impound caught this guy, poking around the remains of Mayson's car.
He ran off before they could catch him, though.
This is the guy I saw buried alive at Mayson's funeral.
It does look like him.
I mean, how you described him to look.
We saw the coffin buried.
I don't get it.
I don't either.
But if he's interested in Mayson's car, so am I.
Officer Highland to the Police Impound Office.
What do you think we're looking for?
I don't know.
Officer Caplan, bay three.
Lois, could you hand me a nail file?
Why do men always assume that women have nail files with them?
I'm sorry.
But do you have a nail file?
Actually, I do.
But only because it's part of my pocket knife.
Officer Frank, please call squad commander.
Sergeant Lever, report to bay two.
Hey, what made you think to look in there?
The French Connection.
It was Mayson's favorite movie.
Really?
Nice work.
See the basement?
STAR Labs has a subzero chamber there.
That's where they store the virus.
So how do we get to it?
There's an air vent that leads directly to the chamber.
Exactly what makes this virus so special?
It's airborne.
It's lethal.
And there's no cure.
Anyone who comes in contact with it will die a very painful death.
Except for us, of course.
Of course.
You'll be wearing protective masks.
This air vent is pretty narrow.
- Nobody in this room is gonna fit.
- That's right.
We're still missing one member of our team.
Your old cellmate.
You mean Buster?
Albie's gonna take a little trip today.
Are you sure there isn't any other way we can get even with Metropolis?
Getting cold feet, Albie?
No.
No, no, sir.
No.
It's just...
Well, exposing everyone to a lethal virus seems I don't know, a little severe.
Nobody cared about my life!
I did.
Oh, yes.
Yes, you did.
Big deal.
Did Professor Hamilton say how long it's gonna take to analyze that pill?
We should have the results sometime this afternoon.
How do I look?
Appropriately cheap.
Just let me do most of the talking.
You usually do.
Excuse me.
We're here to see Buster Williams.
Hey, Buster, you got another visitor.
That's Big Buster Williams.
Hey, Buster.
Macarthy was right.
You're the best-looking guy in the joint.
Hi, I'm Angel.
Macarthy's old lady.
This is my brother, Spike.
That's some killer outfit.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Macarthy never told me he had a doll.
Well, you know him.
He never talked much.
You kidding?
Motor Mouth Macarthy?
So did he send you to fill me in on the job?
The job?
You want a glass of water or something?
No thanks, Spike.
I'm okay.
He's dead.
I guess that really is a killer outfit.
Oh, my God.
Lois.
I got that info you want on that guy buried in plot 29-B.
Diego Martinez, serving 20 years for bank robbery.
He's an expert at getting past security systems, except the last time.
It says that he was in good health and died suddenly.
Cause unknown.
There wasn't an autopsy.
The prison infirmary says they send the bodies directly out to the cemeteries.
What's that?
The report on that pill we found in Mayson's car.
It's a form of synthetic barbiturate that can:
"Induce a temporary state of suspended animation. "
Why would somebody wanna kill Mayson over this?
Clark, this is gonna sound kind of out there.
But what if Mayson found out somebody was using this pill to get criminals out of prison by making it appear as if they died.
That is out there but it's also a great way to break out.
Who would look for you if you were dead?
But the cemetery would have to be in on it.
I'm feeling a sudden urge to plan a funeral.
Who would want to spend eternity in that?
Someone who had their eyes closed.
So sorry to keep you waiting.
I am Mr. Sunshine.
Please, accept my condolences at this difficult time.
Was the dear departed a relative?
- My uncle.
- My aunt.
He...
He was a cross-dresser.
At the time of his death, we weren't sure what he...
She was.
I see.
We have questions.
Could we go to your office?
I carry my office with me.
This way we don't waste any valuable ground.
When you're a cemetery, use of space is very important.
Now, I have only three words to say:
location, location, location.
The plot is everything.
I see.
Well, actually, I was interested in caskets.
Could you show me that one?
Well, those are the economy models but if you insist.
Quite frankly, they offer very little moisture protection.
They're just slightly better than a sandwich bag.
What about that one?
Ah, our Happy Trails model.
An excellent choice.
One-hundred-percent moisture-proof and silk-lined.
Cotton tends to wrinkle so.
Don't you agree?
I think we have to talk it over, but thank you very much.
Of course.
Check around, kick a few handles.
And when you're ready to buy, we'll be here.
Looky-loos.
All three of the prisoner's funerals were paid for by a man named Albie Swinson.
I'll call Jimmy, see what he can find out.
Meet you at 29-B.
If somebody is digging these guys up, I can find evidence.
Lois, you okay?
Yeah, thanks to Agent Scardino.
Please, call me Daniel.
Lucky you were nearby.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, how did you know?
That you'd be here?
I don't know.
I guess we just think alike.
Well, I guess you don't need me.
Funny, I thought he'd be friendlier than that.
Yeah, I wonder what's with him.
Anyway, I should probably go find Clark.
Hold it.
Someone just tried to kill you.
I think you've had enough cemeteries for a while, young lady.
"Young lady"?
Haven't been called that since I went to the prom and I didn't bring the car home.
I just saw Superman fly off.
Are you okay?
I am perfectly fine.
Talk some sense into her.
Someone tried to run her down.
She needs protection.
- Do you want me to take you home?
- No offense, but as a federal agent I'm more qualified to offer protection.
- No offense, but as her partner...
- Hold it, both of you.
I am perfectly capable of protecting myself.
Now I am going home alone.
Way to go, Kent.
Wait, wait, wait!
- Wait, wait!
- Scardino?
Please call me Daniel.
What do you mean, breaking into my house?
Lois, as much as I fantasized about being in this position with you you're crushing my legs.
Look, I'm sorry.
I rang the bell, you didn't answer.
I was drying my hair.
I just got out of the shower.
Yeah, I can see that.
I cannot believe I defended you to Clark.
He was right.
You are crazy.
I don't answer the doorbell, so you come from the roof?
I was worried about you, okay?
Sean Macarthy is an animal.
For all I know he was trying to kill you.
Just what do the words, "I do not need you to protect me," mean to you?
Look, I already lost one woman I cared about to Macarthy.
It is not gonna happen again.
You got it?
Who was she?
My partner, Jenna.
She was bright, sensitive.
A little mouthy sometimes, but then I'm not exactly a monk.
And Macarthy was the bomber?
Excuse me.
Clark?
What are you doing here?
I know it's late.
But I found out Albie Swinson works for a man named Stanley Gables.
Ring a bell?
Gables.
Yeah, that was the name on the file on Mayson's desk.
There's more.
According to the prison sign-in sheet, Albie visited Big Buster, Martinez and Macarthy on the days that each one of them "died. "
- What do you think of that?
- Fascinating.
And well told too.
Of course, you're a writer, so you're good with words.
Agent Scardino just dropped by to chat about the case.
That must have been some chat for you to need to shower.
- See you later.
- Clark.
I think you better go.
Okay.
But I'm not going far.
- Hello?
- Miss Lane?
My name is Albie Swinson.
You've gotta help me.
Albie Swinson?
Please, the toxins in his body are poisoning his mind.
He's going to kill innocent people.
Who, Gables?
I can 't say any more on the telephone.
Meet me at Perpetual Pines, plot 29-B, in half an hour.
Oh, Albie, Albie.
You disappoint me.
Hi, this is Clark.
I'm not home.
Please leave a message and I will call you as soon as I can.
Thanks.
Clark, where are you at 5 a.m.?
Okay, I don't have time to explain.
Just meet me at Perpetual Pines.
Clark!
I thought I was the only one who came in with the roosters.
I had a lot of research to do on a guy named Stanley Gables, chief.
We think he might be tied in to Mayson's death.
Gables?
Gables.
I know that name.
Wasn't that the fellow that used to work for STAR Labs?
One of their top chemists.
He created something called the Alpha virus.
Right.
He had an accident in his lab, and that virus killed four people.
Yeah, apparently it wasn't authorized, so they fired him.
Then he sued, blaming STAR Labs for the accident.
Oh, yeah.
I remember.
Jury didn't buy it.
In fact, we ran an editorial praising the verdict.
You know, this guy just wouldn't take responsibility for his own mistakes.
- Something wrong?
- I wanted to tell Lois to meet me at Gables' house, but she's not answering.
Where could she be at this hour?
- Where's Albie?
- Albie couldn't make it.
Guess I'll just have to go jogging alone this morning.
I don't think so.
Sorry.
Yeah.
All right, there it is.
All right.
Come on, let's do it.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Ready?
Easy.
- Put it down easy, in these brackets.
- Looks good.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, I'm alive in here!
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
I must have really died because, Angel, this is heaven.
Casket transport in progress.
Gentlemen, I believe Buster is about to arrive.
Casket transport complete.
Man, this is heavy.
I thought you said Buster was a little guy.
Now, what are you doing in there?
Would you honestly believe anything I say?
No.
Miss Lane, I presume?
My man in the cemetery was baffled at your disappearance.
It was a unique escape plan, I give you that.
I could return the compliment.
Mr. Macarthy.
I believe love seats were made for two.
Well, gentlemen, our team is now complete.
- Hello, Kent.
- Where's Lois?
She's in bed, like any normal person at 6 in the morning.
Hey, did you bring me a doughnut?
She's gone.
And what are you doing here, anyway?
I slept on the fire escape.
You know, in case she needed me.
She must have snuck out when I went down to the gas station to use the...
Yeah, that fine.
What do you know about Stanley Gables?
Just what you said about him last night.
You don't think that Lois went down to see him by herself?
One thing you should know.
She's very...
Bold.
Headstrong.
Unpredictable.
- To say the least.
- Woman after my own heart.
Check camera two right there, will you?
Bad news.
You got bugs.
Got to spray.
Looks pretty quiet to me.
Why don't you go around back, see if you can find an open door.
This one's open.
After you.
Security systems are down.
- Put the bomb right on the freezer lock.
- Gotcha.
You're sure you know how to get to the subzero chamber?
Just be on the roof in five minutes.
- Where's Gables?
- STAR Labs.
He's going to release the Alpha virus into the atmosphere.
I'm gonna try to find a phone and call the police.
Buster always delivers.
Everybody loves a good Stephen King novel.
Now the city's got to live one.
I don't usually hurt people on purpose, but for the killer of Mayson Drake I might make an exception.
Don't go far.
There's nothing you can do to me beyond what STAR Labs has already done.
Justice will be served.
It's not justice when innocent people are made to suffer for your mistakes.
Yes, it is.
Get away from me!
No!
No.
You should've died with your partner, Scardino.
Please, call him Daniel.
Quite a story, kids.
I'd give my set of gold-plated Elvis spoons to know what makes a guy like Gables tick.
Well, that's the way it is today.
Everybody sees themself as a victim.
It's like nobody takes responsibility for their actions anymore.
I, for one, take responsibility for mine.
Right now, I got a paper to put to bed so I can get out of here in time to have a little candlelight dinner with Alice.
Night, Perry.
- Night.
- Night, chief.
So, Lois, you wanna go see a movie or something?
Yeah.
That sounds nice.
Something funny.
Okay, I'll call and see what's playing.
Hi.
Hi.
I just came by to thank you for what you did.
Oh, that's okay.
And also to ask you a question.
What would you say if I asked you out sometime?
Are you asking me out?
I didn't say that.
I said, "What would you say if I did?"
I don't know.
Tell you what.
The agency is keeping me around Metropolis for a while.
Why don't you think about what you might say and we'll talk.
Well looks like you have some choices to make.
Subtitulos por Loysriono para Tusseries-cifirip
Previously on Lois Clark:
Excuse me, is one of you Clark Kent?
Mayson Drake, deputy DA.
No matter what happens, I'll never lose Clark.
I love you.
You're not the only case I'm working on.
Mayson!
No!
Resurrection.
Oh, my God.
Life is but a journey.
The road may be long the road may be short.
In the case of Mayson Drake, it was tragically short.
Let us pray.
"Into your hands, Oh, Lord, we commend thy faithful servant, Mayson Drake.
Receive her into the arms of thy mercy and to the blessed rest of everlasting peace.
Amen."
You realize that getting rid of Mayson Drake solves only half our problems.
If that pill she got her hands on is found by the wrong people...
- We're looking for it, sir.
- I don't want looking, I want finding.
Are you okay?
The last thing she said to me was resurrection."
What was she trying to tell me?
Maybe you'd like a few minutes alone.
I'll meet you at the car.
Clark!
Clark!
Sorry, Mr. Gables.
- A little mistake with the original dosage.
- "A little mistake"?
If Resurrection is to succeed I can't afford any more dead friends waking up.
Now that's good.
Watch out.
- Shut her down.
- Hey!
Wait.
Stop.
- You got a problem, lady?
- That body you just buried, it's still alive.
It opened its eyes and it looked at me.
No, I know what I saw.
Stop!
Lady, they don't pay me enough for this aggravation.
- It's still alive.
- Look I got a work order to plant this guy in 29-B.
Now, unless I get a court order telling me not to, I'm planting him.
- But, Clark!
- Lois.
Lois, come on.
You probably just imagined it.
Come on, think about this.
We've all been under a lot of stress lately.
So let's just go back to the office, okay?
Come on, come on.
After death, it's not uncommon for a body to have involuntary movements, Lois.
Fine.
Never happened.
Lois my car is in the shop.
Could I borrow your car tonight?
I met this incredible girl this morning...
This morning?
At Mayson's funeral?
That's so tacky.
It didn't start out that way.
Honest.
It just happened.
I thought Angela was the love of your life?
- Yesterday's news.
- Well, that didn't take long.
I'm young.
I'm single.
I gotta keep my options open, Lois.
She left me for a guy with a Ferrari.
Are you happy?
Can I borrow the car, please?
Tell you what.
I'll lend you my car if you call Perpetual Pines and find out who they just buried in plot 29-B.
Deal.
29-B?
How are you doing, son?
Clark?
Okay, I guess.
- How's the story coming?
- Slow.
I can't seem to get a handle on it.
I don't know what's wrong.
You need a couple of days off, you let me know.
Okay?
There's a federal DEA agent coming down here this afternoon.
He's looking into Mayson's death.
Maybe he can help you with your investigation.
Why's the DEA involved?
I don't know.
Maybe they think it's Mob-related.
You know, Mayson had a lot of enemies in the Intergang.
I could get in her office, look at her files...
No, the police have got it cordoned off.
Well, but then when has a little police tape ever stopped you two?
This shouldn't take long.
I could get into any door in this city.
I know, and that worries me.
Find some connection to Intergang, or what she meant by "resurrection." It would be something she was working on recently.
Well, here's something she received the day before she died.
It's a file on somebody named Stanley Gables.
Anything on Intergang or resurrection?
- No.
- Well, keep looking.
Well, how's this for recent?
It's still warm.
A meatball sandwich?
Molanaro's.
Best in the city.
Go ahead, take a bite.
They've got peppers that'll knock your socks off.
- Who are you?
- The cleaning man.
Who are you?
The cleaning woman.
How's that for a coincidence?
We're all cleaners.
Guess the agency overbooked.
You know I'm a very sensitive guy.
I just hate it when people lie to me.
But you don't mind lying yourself.
Touché.
But I've got the gun, so my lie takes precedence.
Unless you're Superman, I wouldn't recommend it.
Please, don't get the wrong impression.
I really am a fun guy.
You should see me at parties.
You know, you have the most incredible eyes.
Well, it's been real.
And don't forget, check out Molanaro's, when you're not so tied up.
Guess he was never a Boy Scout.
His eyes were beady.
Beady and shifty.
I wouldn't say shifty exactly.
They were soft and warm.
They were beady.
Thin lips, hard-set jaw.
I don't think hard.
I think chiseled and his lips, they did this cute little thing where they curled up when he smiled.
Who's that supposed to be, Pinocchio?
Hey, I'm an editorial cartoonist.
You want a portrait, get a camera.
Lois.
Clark.
In my office now.
Agent Scardino, this is Lois Lane and Clark Kent.
- You?
- You?
- Small world.
- You all know each other?
Agent Scardino?
Please.
Call me Daniel.
- Do you always leave by the window?
- I left my macaroni salad on the roof.
Why didn't you identify yourself?
What, and spoil all our fun?
I don't remember you or Miss Lane here whipping out any press credentials either.
Obviously, I've missed something here.
Is there a problem?
There is if Agent Scardino is Washington's idea of solving Mayson's murder.
Washington had nothing to do with this.
In fact, they suggested I keep my distance.
They have this crazy idea I'm some kind of loose cannon.
I wonder where they would get such a crazy idea like that.
If you're not here officially, why are you here?
Because I know who designed the bomb that killed Mayson Drake.
A con by the name of Sean Macarthy.
That guy who was responsible for that series of drug-related bombings in '89?
The same.
I lost someone very close to me in one of those bombings.
I thought Macarthy died in prison three weeks ago.
So they say.
Hit on the DA says otherwise.
I know Macarthy's m.o. like the back of my hand.
I was the one that put him in prison.
Somehow, he's out there again.
So your idea of solving Mayson's murder is looking for a dead man?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
So if you come across any information that might help I'd appreciate you letting me know.
I'm staying at the Bristol.
Please, don't take this the wrong way, but are those eyelashes real?
Of course they're real.
Boy, they're pretty.
Agent Scardino, let me show you the way out over here.
Just show him to a window, Chief.
I'm sure he'll climb out.
Can you believe that guy?
Who does he think he is, Mel Gibson?
- I don't know.
I think he's kind of cute.
- Give me a break.
So, what are you looking for?
Sean Macarthy's obituary, since he's the only lead we have.
Here it is.
He died of natural causes.
He's survived by his mother Colleen Macarthy.
That's a picture of Sean when he was 10.
We took that the day before he blew up the garage.
Look at those dimples.
He was such a cute little boy.
You know, Sean was actually responsible for me taking up needlepoint.
When he went to prison, I had to figure out some way to support myself.
Now I sell these at swap meets.
Now, that's the last picture ever taken of Sean two weeks before he died.
Isn't he adorable?
Mrs. Macarthy, did Sean have any friends?
Only one that I know of.
They were pen pals.
- They wrote to each other?
- Heavens, no.
They met in the pen.
You know, I think that he might've mentioned him in one of these letters that he wrote me from prison.
Tea's ready.
I'll be right back.
Have a look.
This one was sent the day before he died.
"This is probably the last letter I will be writing you from prison.
If you don't hear from me, don't worry, just know that I'm in a far better place."
Sounds like a man who knew he was gonna die.
Lois, I'm gonna go wash up real quick.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna wash up.
Superman, what happened?
I was in the area when I spotted this.
It would've burned this entire house down.
Oh, my.
We're very grateful to you, Superman.
Would you like a cookie?
No, thank you, ma'am.
I'm watching my calories.
Bye-bye, now.
My, he's quite a big boy.
- What happened?
- Somebody tried to burn down the house.
But that sexy Superman fella was in the area and he saved us.
I'm a bit weak in the knees.
I think I better go lie down for a while.
Would you mind if we kept these for a few days?
Be my guest.
They'd be safer with you.
How's your seaweed, sir?
Disgusting.
I know, sir.
But you do need your iodine and B6.
Listen to this, Albie.
"Brilliant scientist invents new diet pill."
I suppose STAR Labs will give him, what, a blue ribbon and a new car?
All they gave me was a pink slip.
- For one little mistake.
- Hey, I didn't make a mistake, they did.
Absolutely, sir.
It's just that you did mention to me that STAR Labs hadn't authorized the experiment you were working on.
You don't achieve greatness by playing by the rules!
With all due respect, sir, I don't know if the four technicians who died of the Alpha virus would feel the same.
What about my pain?
Every day, this virus eats away another piece of me.
So don't think I don't know about sacrifice.
Mr. Gables, I don't wish to upset you any further but we did run into a little snag with the letters.
Tell me they were destroyed.
No.
Superman showed up.
- I'm hyperventilating, Albie.
- Please, Mr. Gables the stress is very bad for you.
Why don't we just rethink the whole idea.
I tried the legal system and it failed me.
The people of Metropolis have spoken and now they're gonna suffer the same way I am.
I thought that it was STAR Labs that you wanted to hurt.
You mean, you want to kill everybody in Metropolis?
If I just wanted to destroy STAR Labs, Albie I would've burned it to the ground.
I wouldn't have invented the Resurrection pill and gathered the three best criminals in the world.
Which reminds me, we have work to do.
- You needed something, Mr. Gables?
- Yes, Mr. Macarthy, I do.
- Lois?
- It's open, Clark.
I picked up some books from the library.
Bartlett's Quotations, Jung's Collective Unconscious, Tolstoy.
Anything with any reference to resurrection.
- Hope you're hungry.
- Get anything from the letters?
No, not yet.
But I'm only halfway through them.
You probably haven't eaten all day.
Here, I made these.
Too much curry.
I knew it.
Do you want some wine?
Lois, is there any reason why we're not getting down to work here?
Actually, there is.
I wanted to ask you something.
I need to know if I'm yesterday's news.
- What?
- You know.
Stale, old.
I mean, it's been a week since our first date and our first kiss.
You haven't said a word about it.
It's like it never happened.
Lois, I'm sorry if it feels like I've been ignoring you lately, but...
Just a second.
- Hi.
- Agent Scardino.
- Call me Daniel.
May I come in?
- Well...
Sorry to drop in like this, but I was thinking maybe if we start working together...
Look who's here.
If it isn't the man with the smoldering eyes.
What are you talking about?
Mayson's diary.
Pretty steamy stuff.
Read like an Emily Brontë novel.
You read Emily Brontë?
Well, what can I say.
I'm a hopeless romantic.
Rumaki.
My favorite.
Too much curry.
It's perfect.
I like it spicy.
Anyway, Kent.
She wrote some really passionate purple prose, mainly about you.
And you said you were just friends.
You holding out on me, Kent?
Well, Clark was probably the only person in Metropolis that didn't know that Mayson was madly in love with him.
Who's holding out on who, Scardino?
You took the diary.
I'm willing to share.
You work with me, I'll work with you.
Now, what have you got for me?
Well, the last word Mayson said before she died was, "Resurrection."
The last entry in her diary was:
"Resurrection equals Macarthy" with a question mark.
- Daily Planet, how may I direct your call?
- Hi, Clark.
- Where you been?
- Checking on Wild Man Scardino.
Turns out that he's been on probation more than any other DEA agent.
Anything else?
Yeah, he's also their most decorated agent.
- Still reading Macarthy's letters?
- Yeah.
I've been thinking about this last letter he wrote about being in a better place.
What if he wasn't talking about the hereafter.
What if he was just talking about a better place outside the prison walls.
So you're saying you think he faked his own death?
- Dan says that the bomb...
- Wait.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
Now it's "Dan"?
What is with you?
What is so bad about him?
What is so good about him?
A lot of things.
Okay, he's a little different.
Anyway, he said that the bomb that killed Mayson could only have been built by Macarthy.
- If that's true...
- Okay, I'll play along.
So maybe we should pay Macarthy's pen pal a visit.
I already made an appointment.
The guy's name is Big Buster Williams.
You'd better take a look at these.
The camera at the police impound caught this guy, poking around the remains of Mayson's car.
He ran off before they could catch him, though.
This is the guy I saw buried alive at Mayson's funeral.
It does look like him.
I mean, how you described him to look.
But we saw the coffin buried.
I don't get it.
I don't either.
But if he's interested in Mayson's car, so am I.
Officer Highland to the Police Impound Office.
What do you think we're looking for?
I don't know.
Officer Caplan, bay three.
Lois, could you hand me a nail file?
Why do men always assume that women have nail files with them?
I'm sorry.
But do you have a nail file?
Actually, I do.
But only because it's part of my pocket knife.
Officer Frank, please call squad commander.
Sergeant Lever, report to bay two.
Hey, what made you think to look in there?
The French Connection.
It was Mayson's favorite movie.
Really?
Nice work.
See the basement?
STAR Labs has a subzero chamber there.
That's where they store the virus.
So how do we get to it?
There's an air vent that leads directly to the chamber.
Exactly what makes this virus so special?
It's airborne.
It's lethal.
And there's no cure.
Anyone who comes in contact with it will die a very painful death.
Except for us, of course.
Of course.
You'll be wearing protective masks.
This air vent is pretty narrow.
- Nobody in this room is gonna fit.
- That's right.
We're still missing one member of our team.
Your old cellmate.
You mean Buster?
Albie's gonna take a little trip today.
Sir, are you sure there isn't any other way we can get even with Metropolis?
Getting cold feet, Albie?
No.
No, no, sir.
No.
It's just...
Well, exposing everyone to a lethal virus seems I don't know, a little severe.
Nobody cared about my life!
I did.
Yes.
Yes, you did.
Big deal.
Did Professor Hamilton say how long it's gonna take to analyze that pill?
We should have the results sometime this afternoon.
How do I look?
Appropriately cheap.
Just let me do most of the talking.
You usually do.
Excuse me.
We're here to see Buster Williams.
Hey, Buster, you got another visitor.
That's Big Buster Williams.
Hey, Buster.
Macarthy was right.
You're the best-looking guy in the joint.
Hi, I'm Angel.
Macarthy's old lady.
This is my brother, Spike.
That's some killer outfit.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Macarthy never told me he had a doll.
Well, you know him.
He never talked much.
You kidding?
Motor Mouth Macarthy?
So did he send you to fill me in on the job?
The job?
You want a glass of water or something?
No thanks, Spike.
I'm okay.
He's dead.
I guess that really is a killer outfit.
Oh, my God.
Lois.
I got that info you want on that guy buried in plot 29-B.
Diego Martinez, serving 20 years for bank robbery.
He's an expert at getting past security systems, except the last time.
It says that he was in good health and died suddenly.
Cause unknown.
There wasn't an autopsy.
The prison infirmary says they send the bodies directly out to the cemeteries.
What's that?
The report on that pill we found in Mayson's car.
It's a form of synthetic barbiturate that can:
"Induce a temporary state of suspended animation."
Why would somebody wanna kill Mayson over this?
Clark, this is gonna sound kind of out there.
But what if Mayson found out somebody was using this pill to get criminals out of prison by making it appear as if they died.
That is out there but it's also a great way to break out.
Who would look for you if you were dead?
But the cemetery would have to be in on it.
I'm feeling a sudden urge to plan a funeral.
Who would want to spend eternity in that?
Someone who had their eyes closed.
So sorry to keep you waiting.
I am Mr. Sunshine.
Please, accept my condolences at this difficult time.
Was the dear departed a relative?
- My uncle.
- My aunt.
He...
He was a cross-dresser.
At the time of his death, we weren't sure what he...
She was.
I see.
We have questions.
Could we go to your office?
I carry my office with me.
This way we don't waste any valuable ground.
When you're a cemetery, use of space is very important.
Now, I have only three words to say:
Location, location, location.
The plot is everything.
I see.
Well, actually, I was interested in caskets.
Could you show me that one?
Well, those are the economy models but if you insist.
Quite frankly, they offer very little moisture protection.
They're just slightly better than a sandwich bag.
What about that one?
Our Happy Trails model.
An excellent choice.
One-hundred-percent moisture-proof and silk-lined.
Cotton tends to wrinkle so.
Don't you agree?
I think we have to talk it over, but thank you very much.
Of course.
Check around, kick a few handles.
And when you're ready to buy, we'll be here.
Looky-loos.
All three of the prisoner's funerals were paid for by a man named Albie Swinson.
I'll call Jimmy, see what he can find out.
I'll meet you at 29-B.
If somebody is digging these guys up, maybe I can find evidence.
Lois, you okay?
Yeah, thanks to Agent Scardino.
Please, call me Daniel.
Lucky you were nearby.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, how did you know?
That you'd be here?
I don't know.
I guess we just think alike.
Well, I guess you don't need me.
Funny, I thought he'd be friendlier than that.
Yeah, I wonder what's with him.
Anyway, I should probably go find Clark.
Hold it.
Someone just tried to kill you.
I think you've had enough cemeteries for a while, young lady.
"Young lady"?
Haven't been called that since I went to the prom and I didn't bring the car home.
I just saw Superman fly off.
Are you okay?
I am perfectly fine.
Talk some sense into your partner.
Someone tried to run her down.
She needs protection.
- Do you want me to take you home?
- No offense, but as a federal agent I'm more qualified to offer protection.
- Scardino, no offense, but as her partner...
- Hold it, both of you.
I am perfectly capable of protecting myself.
Now I am going home alone.
Way to go, Kent.
Wait, wait, wait!
- Wait, wait!
- Scardino?
Please call me Daniel.
What do you mean, breaking into my house?
Lois, as much as I fantasized about being in this position with you you're crushing my legs.
Look, I'm sorry.
I rang the bell, you didn't answer.
I was drying my hair.
I just got out of the shower.
Yeah, I can see that.
I cannot believe I defended you to Clark.
He was right.
You are crazy.
I don't answer the doorbell, so you come from the roof?
I was worried about you, okay?
Sean Macarthy is an animal.
For all I know he was trying to kill you.
Just what do the words, "I do not need you to protect me," mean to you?
Look, I already lost one woman I cared about to Macarthy.
It is not gonna happen again.
You got it?
Who was she?
My partner, Jenna.
She was bright, sensitive.
A little mouthy sometimes, but then I'm not exactly a monk.
And Macarthy was the bomber?
Excuse me.
Clark?
What are you doing here?
I know it's late.
But I found out Albie Swinson works for a man named Stanley Gables.
Ring a bell?
Gables.
Yeah, that was the name on the file on Mayson's desk.
There's more.
According to the prison sign-in sheet, Albie visited Big Buster, Martinez and Macarthy on the days that each one of them "died."
- What do you think of that?
- Fascinating.
And well told too.
Of course, you're a writer, so you're good with words.
Agent Scardino just dropped by to chat about the case.
That must have been some chat for you to need to shower.
- See you later.
- Clark.
I think you better go.
Okay.
But I'm not going far.
- Hello?
- Miss Lane?
My name is Albie Swinson.
You've gotta help me.
Albie Swinson?
Please, the toxins in his body are poisoning his mind.
He's going to kill innocent people.
Who, Gables?
I can't say any more on the telephone.
Meet me at Perpetual Pines, plot 29-B, in half an hour.
Albie, Albie.
You disappoint me.
Hi, this is Clark.
I'm not home.
Please leave a message and I will call you as soon as I can.
Thanks.
Clark, where are you at 5 a.m.?
Okay, I don't have time to explain.
Just meet me at Perpetual Pines.
Clark!
I thought I was the only one who came in with the roosters.
I had a lot of research to do on a guy named Stanley Gables, Chief.
We think he might be tied in to Mayson's death.
Gables?
Gables.
I know that name.
Wasn't that the fellow that used to work for STAR Labs?
One of their top chemists.
He created something called the Alpha virus.
Right.
He had an accident in his lab, and that virus killed four people.
Yeah, apparently it wasn't authorized, so they fired him.
Then he sued, blaming STAR Labs for the accident.
Yeah.
I remember.
Jury didn't buy it.
In fact, we ran an editorial praising the verdict.
You know, this guy just wouldn't take responsibility for his own mistakes.
- Something wrong?
- I wanted to tell Lois to meet me at Gables' house, but she's not answering.
Where could she be at this hour?
- Where's Albie?
- Albie couldn't make it.
Guess I'll just have to go jogging alone this morning.
I don't think so.
Sorry.
Yeah.
All right, there it is.
All right.
Come on, let's do it.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Ready?
Easy.
- Put it down easy, in these brackets.
- Looks good.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, I'm alive in here!
No!
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
I must have really died because, Angel, this is heaven.
Casket transport in progress.
Gentlemen, I believe Buster is about to arrive.
Casket transport complete.
Man, this is heavy.
I thought you said Buster was a little guy.
Now, what are you doing in there?
Would you honestly believe anything I say?
No.
Miss Lane, I presume?
My man in the cemetery was baffled at your disappearance.
It was a unique escape plan, I give you that.
I could return the compliment.
Mr. Macarthy.
I believe love seats were made for two.
Well, gentlemen, our team is now complete.
- Hello, Kent.
- Where's Lois?
She's in bed, like any normal person at 6 in the morning.
Hey, did you bring me a doughnut?
She's gone.
And what are you doing here, anyway?
I slept on the fire escape.
You know, in case she needed me.
She must have snuck out when I went down to the gas station to use the...
Yeah, that fine.
What do you know about Stanley Gables?
Just what you said about him last night.
You don't think that Lois went down to see him by herself?
One thing you should know.
She's very...
Bold.
Headstrong.
Unpredictable.
- To say the least.
- Woman after my own heart.
Check camera two right there, will you?
Bad news.
You got bugs.
Got to spray.
Looks pretty quiet to me.
Why don't you go around back, see if you can find an open door.
This one's open.
After you.
Security systems are down.
- Put the bomb right on the freezer lock.
- Gotcha.
You're sure you know how to get to the subzero chamber?
Just be on the roof in five minutes.
- Where's Gables?
- STAR Labs.
He's going to release the Alpha virus into the atmosphere.
I'm gonna try to find a phone and call the police.
Buster always delivers.
Everybody loves a good Stephen King novel.
Now the city's got to live one.
I don't usually hurt people on purpose, but for the killer of Mayson Drake I might make an exception.
Don't go far.
There's nothing more you can do to me beyond what STAR Labs has already done.
Justice will be served.
It's not justice when innocent people are made to suffer for your mistakes.
Yes, it is.
Get away from me!
No!
No.
You should've died with your partner, Scardino.
Please, call him Daniel.
Quite a story, kids.
I'd give my set of gold-plated Elvis spoons to know what makes a guy like Gables tick.
Well, that's the way it is today.
Everybody sees themself as a victim.
It's like nobody takes responsibility for their actions anymore.
Well, I, for one, take responsibility for mine.
Right now, I got a paper to put to bed so I can get out of here in time to have a little candlelight dinner with Alice.
Night, Perry.
- Night.
- Night, Chief.
So, Lois, you wanna go see a movie or something?
Yeah.
That sounds nice.
Something funny.
Okay, I'll call and see what's playing.
Hi.
Hi.
I just came by to thank you for what you did.
That's okay.
And also to ask you a question.
What would you say if I asked you out sometime?
Are you asking me out?
I didn't say that.
I said, "What would you say if I did?"
I don't know.
Tell you what.
The agency is keeping me around Metropolis for a while.
Why don't you think about what you might say and we'll talk.
Well looks like you have some choices to make.
- Steady her up there.
Steady her up, sir.
- Look at this, sir.
- What is it?
I don't know, sir.
But it's big, real big.
Captain, it's the lookout, sir.
What is it, lookout?
On the port bow.
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, my golly.
Hey, you guys in there.
You wanna watch my show?
Do we have a choice?
Huh?
Aah!
Oh.
It's you.
Mr. Sulu from Star Trek.
George Takei.
Wow, I'm Fan Boy.
Everyone calls me that, even my folks.
Oh, you're my favorite character.
Right after Kirk, Spock, Bones, Chekov and Uhura.
Hey, have you noticed when you shake hands for a long time your hands get super sweaty?
Oh, you know what?
Oh, darn, I just remembered something.
Hey!
I want you to know right now that I'm not one of those weirdoes.
I always respect the boundaries set between a creative person and their audience.
Sulu!
I'm walking with Sulu!
Hey!
Oh.
Wait!
Come back!
Oh.
All I wanted was to make friends.
But every time I meet one of my heroes they run away like I'm some kind of a nut case.
We interrupt this program for the following special report.
I'm Christina Shiniqua Sanchez Toyota O'Mally reporting live from downtown, where in another incident gone freaky Freakazoid has helped police apprehend the notorious criminal, Milkman.
This was the scene not 10 minutes ago as Freakazoid and his newest sidekick, Expendable Lad slugged it out with the lethally lactic Milkman.
Though Freakazoid eventually won the battle tragedy struck when Expendable Lad was severely milked.
And now the big question is who will be Freakazoid's next sidekick in his ongoing fight against crime?
Yeah, then everybody would respect me.
Keep them coming, Mike.
Expendable Lad, we hardly knew ye.
Hey, Mike, enough with the bells.
Sorry, I'm giving angels their wings.
- Well, cut it out and give me another one.
- Hey, slow down, Mr. F.
It's not like Expendable Lad's dead or anything.
He's just in the hospital with a bruised clavicle.
I said, give me another one, curse your tiny paper hat.
If I wanna blitz myself into some papaya-induced hallucination that's my business.
Hello.
Wait, wait.
- Ooh, yummy.
- I'm Fan Boy.
I'm gonna be your new sidekick.
Sorry, pal.
No more sidekicks.
I can't stand the guilt.
Ugh.
Or the hot dogs.
But I've studied everything about you.
For instance, you always drown your sorrows in papaya juice after you lose a sidekick.
That's because I'm allergic to cranapple.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It's been a kick.
Gotta fly.
Pretty nifty gizmo, huh, kids?
Well, here's the announcer to tell you how you can have your very own.
That's right, kids.
New this season, it's the Freak Mobile.
Now with this nifty boot-kicking attachment.
It moves back and forth and even comes with this small, chubby little Fan Boy, suitable for kicking.
Wow, what fun.
It's the toy we think you should buy.
Freakazoid Freak Mobile comes with boot-kicking attachment and chubby little Fan Boy.
Fingers not included.
Batteries sold separately.
"Song of the Volga Boatmen" not available.
We thought this would be funny.
This has been a fake commercial.
Continue enjoying our fine programming.
Please, let me be your sidekick.
I've memorized all your adventures.
Huh?
Wha...?
Like the time you defeated Gargoyle Gal by showing her a mouthful of chewed-up coleslaw.
Enh.
I'm sorry, it was tuna salad.
Then there was the time you tricked the Pummeler into dropping his guard by swallowing his dog.
Unh.
- You really have no life, do you?
- No, sir.
All right, kid.
You wanna be my new sidekick, you gotta pass the initiation test.
Challenge me.
Mr. Camera Guy, zip pan to the next scene.
No!
The other scene!
Am I working alone here?
Thank you.
Wow.
Where are we?
My Freakalair.
- I didn't know you had one of these.
- Well, in this episode anyway.
You know, we're trying a lot of stuff out, seeing what sticks.
Ah, my mute butler, Ingmar.
Prepare the initiation test and holler when ready.
What's taking my mute butler so long?
Ah, good.
Thank you, Ingmar.
Go have a treat.
He's mute, you know.
Let the initiation test begin.
First, we put you in the special virtual-reality helmet then stick you in a simulated action scenario.
Now, count to 900 and don't get sick.
I'm free!
I'm free!
Hmm.
You know, I think this might be the perfect time to have a conversation with my inner child.
Billy?
Billy?
Hello, I've grown quite large.
I've brought you shorts.
Good.
I can't come out because of my girth.
I brought you a diet book as well.
Okay.
I think we've gone as far as we can go.
Scratch one sycophant.
Ah, I hate to tell you, but you already used that trick to escape the Venusian Moon Goons in the "Heck-Bent for Sparky" episode.
Look, little guy.
Get this through your Clearasil-soaked head:
I don't need another sidekick.
But every hero needs a sidekick to assist in the battle against crime to uphold the truth and most important, to handle the overflow babes.
Ruff.
Yowza.
Hee.
Hey you, Freak!
Thanks.
Help me!
I can't let that happen.
Now, kid, look.
You're weird, you're kooky, you're everything.
But I don't need another sidekick.
Now, beat it.
No!
Wait, I'm going with you.
Wow.
That was terrific.
I can't wait to go on adventures with you all the time.
Please, please, leave me alone.
I'll give you anything.
Anything you want, if you'll just go away.
How about the just-written script to Batman 4?
Plucked it off the Internet last night.
An autographed photo of Stan Lee?
- Who's that?
- No idea.
- How about your very own Harlan Ellison?
- You can't buy me off.
No matter what happens, I'll always be your Fan Boy.
Huh?
Yes.
Look, it's Mark Hamill.
Oh, no.
I'm not falling for that trick again.
Honest.
Aah.
Oh, Mark Hamill.
Why settle for being a mere sidekick when Jedi knighthood awaits?
Yes, the Force is strong in this one.
- Luke, join me.
- Come again?
Join me and together we can end this destructive conflict and rule the galaxy as Fan Boy and son.
No, I'll never join you.
It is your destiny.
No!
No, wait.
Come back.
Come back, I won't hurt you.
Kids, if we've learned anything today, it's that your parents are right.
Comic books really will rot your mind.
And now we present the Lawn Gnomes.
I, Baffeardin, chronicle the tales of my people as we help mankind fight wrongdoing.
But this was not always so.
For we are an elder race, old as rock, born in a time before time.
We are wise and cunning.
We stole man's fire and tried to hide it in our pockets.
That was painful and dumb.
So we became even more cunning.
We became a shadow people, following man throughout history.
We became really annoying.
And virtually unemployable.
I'm hungry.
Can we eat that crow?
No.
Be quiet.
Maybe later.
We are despised by mankind.
Unjustly thought to be no better than beasts.
Can we eat those Vikings?
They may have had a point.
We are Lawn Gnomes.
Not now, we're on the job.
Vikings, I'm home.
Hi, Eric.
Cease!
Help!
Gnomes!
You miserable gnomes are the scourge of all Daneland.
- Big deal.
- You'll pay for insulting Eric the Large.
Maybe you should change your name to Eric-the-Large-Guy-Without-Any-Pants.
My older brother is a powerful wizard.
He'll put a whopping great curse on you for this.
- You'll see.
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- I'm shaking.
Write if you get trousers.
Jovial little buggers, ain't they?
And so, we spent our last evening before the great change.
Great-uncle Huska?
No, they're all mine.
Get away.
That wasn't it.
I wanna know why humans don't like us.
Humans are prejudiced.
They think we all carry knives or something.
That's why they don't like us.
Boy, is that a bunch of bull hooky.
The Great Mystic Gnome.
You bet your tall hat I am.
Humans dislike you because you steal their trousers pour slop on them from atop buildings, then run away and giggle.
- Thanks.
- Appreciate it.
- Just doing our best.
- That wasn't a compliment.
Even by gnome standards, you are shifty, low, and disgusting.
You are rats with hats.
But what shall we do?
You must change your ways and begin to fight wrongdoing instead of causing it.
How come?
- It's a good thing.
So do it or I'll have you roughed up.
Change your ways this very night.
Now, farewell.
Try not to foul up.
Hey, what gives?
We have been given a sign.
We must change our ways.
Yes, change is fat with risk, but risk is the stuff of life.
Henceforth, let us go forward and help people.
Who is with me?
Hurrah.
I'm taking notes on this show.
Thus, with new resolve, we began our last morning having decided to alter our old ways, in about a week or so.
Fatty on the ground.
Gnomes, I should've guessed.
Is there any chance you could just untie me and let me go?
Oh, no.
It would set a bad precedent.
Fine.
Did I mention that I am Rathgar the Wizard?
Not to boast.
Ah.
My brother used to have a helmet like that.
Perhaps you know him?
Eric the Large?
A Viking?
A large man?
A large Viking man?
Ah, yes, yes, I know him.
Don't count us out yet, Rathgar.
Now you'll learn what cornered gnomes are capable of.
- Ready?
Ready!
Prepare to grovel for mercy.
Ew.
You're disgusting.
I feel unclean.
- Then you'll let us go?
- No.
Please, please.
Silence.
I said, silence, you horrid gnomes.
Prepare to receive a horrible, twisting curse that will last 4000 years.
I've got a full day ahead, so let's go.
- I'm going to apologize.
- What for?
We've tried everything else.
Hold your curse, Rathgar.
Mugging you and your brother was wrong.
For my deeds, I wish to say I'm...
- Sorry.
My goodness.
A gnome actually apologized.
And the rest of you?
Your willingness to change has so impressed me that I will effect a different curse.
Can you make slow, overweight birds appear out of thin air?
Yes, but I won't.
Since you used the day for mischief henceforth the sunlight will transform you into statues.
Only during the night will you know life.
You will live like this until you mend your ways and serve mankind without profit or gain.
The sooner you change, the sooner the curse is over.
So there, you're cursed.
Goodbye.
That's not so bad.
We'll have this curse beat in a couple of weeks.
Piece of cake.
Still, time does have a way of slipping by as we continue to skillfully aid mankind in battling evil.
We are Lawn Gnomes.
Well, that's all from the Lawn Gnomes.
Let's learn how to speak French because it's time for "Frenching with Freakazoid. "
Who cut the cheese?
Who cut the cheese?
This has been "Frenching with Freakazoid. "
- Steady her up there.
PILOT:
Steady her up, sir.
- Look at this, sir.
- What is it?
I don't know, sir.
But it's big, real big.
FIRST OFFICER:
Captain, it's the lookout, sir.
What is it, lookout?
LOOKOUT [O VER PHONE]:
On the port bow.
I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, my golly.
Hey, you guys in there.
You wanna watch my show?
Do we have a choice?
Huh?
Aah!
Oh.
It's you.
Mr. Sulu from Star Trek.
George Takei.
Wow, I'm Fan Boy.
Everyone calls me that, even my folks.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, you're my favorite character.
Right after Kirk, Spock, Bones, Chekov and Uhura.
Hey, have you noticed when you shake hands for a long time your hands get super sweaty?
Oh, you know what?
Oh, darn, I just remembered something.
Hey!
I want you to know right now that I'm not one of those weirdoes.
I always respect the boundaries set between a creative person and their audience.
Sulu!
I'm walking with Sulu!
[YELLING]
Hey!
Oh.
Wait!
Come back!
Oh.
All I wanted was to make friends.
But every time I meet one of my heroes they run away like I'm some kind of a nut case.
MAN [ON TV]:
We interrupt this program for the following special report.
I'm Christina Shiniqua Sanchez Toyota O'Mally reporting live from downtown, where in another incident gone freaky Freakazoid has helped police apprehend the notorious criminal, Milkman.
CHRISTINA:
This was the scene not 10 minutes ago as Freakazoid and his newest sidekick, Expendable Lad slugged it out with the lethally lactic Milkman.
Though Freakazoid eventually won the battle tragedy struck when Expendable Lad was severely milked.
[GRUNTS]
And now the big question is who will be Freakazoid's next sidekick in his ongoing fight against crime?
Yeah, then everybody would respect me.
Keep them coming, Mike.
Expendable Lad, we hardly knew ye.
[CASH REGISTER BELL RINGING]
Hey, Mike, enough with the bells.
Sorry, I'm giving angels their wings.
- Well, cut it out and give me another one.
- Hey, slow down, Mr. F.
It's not like Expendable Lad's dead or anything.
He's just in the hospital with a bruised clavicle.
I said, give me another one, curse your tiny paper hat.
If I wanna blitz myself into some papaya-induced hallucination that's my business.
Hello.
Wait, wait.
- Ooh, yummy.
- I'm Fan Boy.
I'm gonna be your new sidekick.
Sorry, pal.
No more sidekicks.
I can't stand the guilt.
Ugh.
[BELCHES]
Or the hot dogs.
FAN BO Y:
But I've studied everything about you.
For instance, you always drown your sorrows in papaya juice after you lose a sidekick.
That's because I'm allergic to cranapple.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It's been a kick.
Gotta fly.
Pretty nifty gizmo, huh, kids?
Well, here's the announcer to tell you how you can have your very own.
NARRATOR:
That's right, kids.
New this season, it's the Freak Mobile.
Now with this nifty boot-kicking attachment.
It moves back and forth and even comes with this small, chubby little Fan Boy, suitable for kicking.
Wow, what fun.
It's the toy we think you should buy.
Freakazoid Freak Mobile comes with boot-kicking attachment and chubby little Fan Boy.
Fingers not included.
Batteries sold separately.
"Song of the Volga Boatmen" not available.
We thought this would be funny.
This has been a fake commercial.
Continue enjoying our fine programming.
FAN BO Y:
Please, let me be your sidekick.
I've memorized all your adventures.
Huh?
Wha...?
Like the time you defeated Gargoyle Gal by showing her a mouthful of chewed-up coleslaw.
Enh.
I'm sorry, it was tuna salad.
[FAN BO Y YELLING THEN GRUNTING]
Then there was the time you tricked the Pummeler into dropping his guard by swallowing his dog.
Unh.
- You really have no life, do you?
- No, sir.
[YELLING]
[FAN BO Y GRUNTING]
All right, kid.
You wanna be my new sidekick, you gotta pass the initiation test.
Challenge me.
Mr. Camera Guy, zip pan to the next scene.
FREAKAZOID:
No!
The other scene!
Am I working alone here?
Thank you.
FAN BO Y:
Wow.
Where are we?
FREAKAZOID:
My Freakalair.
- I didn't know you had one of these.
- Well, in this episode anyway.
You know, we're trying a lot of stuff out, seeing what sticks.
Ah, my mute butler, Ingmar.
Prepare the initiation test and holler when ready.
What's taking my mute butler so long?
[SHOUTING SILENTLY]
Ah, good.
Thank you, Ingmar.
Go have a treat.
He's mute, you know.
Let the initiation test begin.
First, we put you in the special virtual-reality helmet then stick you in a simulated action scenario.
Now, count to 900 and don't get sick.
I'm free!
I'm free!
Hmm.
You know, I think this might be the perfect time to have a conversation with my inner child.
FREAKAZOID:
Billy?
Billy?
BILLY:
Hello, I've grown quite large.
FREAKAZOID:
I've brought you shorts.
BILLY:
Good.
I can't come out because of my girth.
FREAKAZOID:
I brought you a diet book as well.
BILLY:
Okay.
I think we've gone as far as we can go.
Scratch one sycophant.
FAN BO Y:
Ah, I hate to tell you, but you already used that trick to escape the Venusian Moon Goons in the "Heck-Bent for Sparky" episode.
Look, little guy.
Get this through your Clearasil-soaked head:
I don't need another sidekick.
But every hero needs a sidekick to assist in the battle against crime to uphold the truth and most important, to handle the overflow babes.
Ruff.
Yowza.
Hee.
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]
FAN BO Y:
Hey you, Freak!
Thanks.
[SCREAMING] Help me!
I can't let that happen.
Now, kid, look.
You're weird, you're kooky, you're everything.
But I don't need another sidekick.
Now, beat it.
No!
Wait, I'm going with you.
[FREAKAZOID GRUNTING]
[BOTH YELLING]
[BOTH GRUNT]
Wow.
That was terrific.
I can't wait to go on adventures with you all the time.
Please, please, leave me alone.
I'll give you anything.
Anything you want, if you'll just go away.
How about the just-written script to Batman 4?
Plucked it off the Internet last night.
An autographed photo of Stan Lee?
- Who's that?
- No idea.
[MAN GRUNTS]
- How about your very own Harlan Ellison?
- You can't buy me off.
No matter what happens, I'll always be your Fan Boy.
Huh?
Yes.
Look, it's Mark Hamill.
Oh, no.
I'm not falling for that trick again.
FREAKAZOID:
Honest.
FAN BO Y:
Aah.
Oh, Mark Hamill.
Why settle for being a mere sidekick when Jedi knighthood awaits?
Yes, the Force is strong in this one.
- Luke, join me.
- Come again?
Join me and together we can end this destructive conflict and rule the galaxy as Fan Boy and son.
No, I'll never join you.
It is your destiny.
[YELLING] No!
No, wait.
Come back.
Come back, I won't hurt you.
[CHUCKLING]
Kids, if we've learned anything today, it's that your parents are right.
Comic books really will rot your mind.
[LAUGHING]

THREE COLOURS BLUE
Come on, Anne.
Get in.
Are you able to talk?
During the...
Were you conscious?
I'm sorry to have to inform you...
Do you know?
Your husband died in the accident.
But you weren't conscious all that time.
Anne?
Yes, your daughter too.
Is someone there?
Who did it?
Mr. Leroy?
Please call the guards.
Somebody broke a window on the 1st floor.
I'll look in the garden.
I can't do that.
- I broke the window.
- Don't worry.
We'll replace it.
- I am sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Is it today?
- This afternoon.
At 17.00.
Can I do anything for you?
We gathered to pay respects to the memory of the man and composer, known as one of the most outstanding in the world.
Nobody can accept that he is gone.
We also mourn his 5 year-old daughter.
Who died by his side.
Patrice, millions of men and women awaited the music you composed for the Unification of Europe, which we all hope to celebrate soon.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- I know you don't want to see me.
- Right.
- Can I come in?
- No.
Julie, I don't want an interview.
- What then?
- I'm writing an article about your husband.
- I need to know something.
- About what?
The concert for the Unification of Europe.
- It doesn't exist.
- You've changed.
- You were not so rude before.
- Haven't you heard?
I lost in my daughter and husband in an accident.
Is it true you wrote your husband's music?
Good morning.
Bernard!
- Good morning madam.
- Did you do what I asked?
- Did you clear the blue room?
- Everything.
Madam, we're all deeply sorry.
Marie?
Why are you crying?
Because you're not.
I keep thinking about them.
I remember everything.
How can I forget?
- no thanks.
- Lets sit down.
This could take a while.
- I'll be right back.
Nobody must know about it.
You will pay for my mother's rest home for the rest of her life.
You will take care of Marie and the gardener.
You will sell all our property and pay all the money in one account.
- 27-0641-196?
- Yes.
May I ask why?
No.
Would you excuse me.
- But what will you have left?
- My own account.
I haven't started yet.
- I put it aside...
- The day I left?
- Yes
Here it is.
I was waiting to hear from you.
You were right.
A lot of corrections.
No more than usual.
It's beautiful.
I love this chorus.
It's Julie.
Do you love me?
- Yes.
- Since when?
Since I started working with Patrice.
- Do you think of me?
- Yes.
Come if you want to.
- Now?
- Yes. now.
Right away.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Olivier?
- I fell.
- Please take it off.
The rest too.
They took everything.
Only the matress is left.
I appreciate what you did for me.
But you see I'm like others.
I sweat, cough.
I have cavities.
You won't miss me.
You understand that now.
Shut the door when you leave.
Julie!
I don't want any children in the building.
Let me ask you something.
It may help.
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
- I mean, for a living?
- Nothing.
I have what you are looking for.
But the apartment needs repairing.
It may take a while.
- Can I live there now?
- Sure.
It needs a quick paint.
- Can I look see it now?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Julie de Courcy, with a "Y".
Sorry, Julie Vignon.I am going back to my maiden name.
- Coffee and ice cream?
- As usual.
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?
- I'm sorry for the noise.
I've almost finished
- I haven't heard anything.
Can I come in?
I heard you got locked out last week.
Your husband lent me a blanket.
I spent the night in the stairwell.
I wanted you to sign this.
- What is it?
- Everyone has signed already.
We don't want loose women in our building.
The young woman downstairs...
- I don't want to get involved.
- She is a whore.
I don't care.
You are in perfect health.
Everything is fine.
You are in good spirits.
- Hello, it's Antoine.
- It is for you.
My name is Antoine.
You don't know me...
No I don't.
Excuse me.
- Who is it?
- Some boy.
He has been looking for you.
I said he could call.
- Lets meet.
It's important.
- Nothing is important.
- It is about an object.
- What?
A necklace with a cross.
I'd forgotten about it.
I found it near the car.
I couldn't keep it.
That's stealing.
If you want to ask me something, I got there just after...
No.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to return the necklace...
- I wanted to ask you something too.
- Yes?
When I opened the door...
your husband was still alive.
He said...
I don't understand.
He said "Now try coughing."
He was telling us a joke.
It's about a woman who can't stop coughing.
She sees a doctor.
He examined her and gave her a pill.
She swallowed it.
And asked "What was it?"
"The most powerful laxative".
"A laxative for a cough?"
"Yes.
Try coughing now."
It made us laugh.
Then the car crashed.
My husband always liked to repeat the punch line.
You returned it.
It is yours.
Are you sick?
Are you ok?
- You always gotta hold onto something.
- What did you say?
Thank you.
- For what?
- I'm staying.
In order to throw me away, they had to collect signatures of all occupants.
Your place is nice.
When I was a little girl, I had a lamp like this.
I'd stand under it and stretch out my hand.
I wanted to jump and touch it.
I forgot all about it.
Where did you find it?
I found it.
Souvenir?
Do you live here alone?
Yes.
I could never spend a night alone.
Something must have happened.
You are not the type someone dumps.
Forgive me, I talk too much.
Poor guy.
- Who?
- He was asleep there last night.
He's gone now but left the flute.
Julie?
A coffee.
I searched everywhere.
And I found you.
Nobody knows where I live.
It took a few months.
Then I got lucky.
My cleaning lady's daughter saw you in the area.
- I've come here ever since.
- Do you spy me?
I miss you.
Did you run away?
From me?
Do you hear what he is playing?
- It sounds like...
- Yes.
I've seen you.
Maybe that will do for now.
I'll try.
- How do you know this music?
- I invent lots of things.
I like to play.
Just a second.
A problem with your place?
No.
I would like another one like this.
- I can manage that but it will take time.
- How long?
2-3 months.
You cut yourself.
My cat scratched me.
Mom?
Marie-France.
It's me.
Julie.
Come to me.
I've heard you are dead.
You seem fine.
Very young.
You were always younger, you look 30 now.
I'm not your sister, but daughter.
I'm 33.
I know.
I was kidding.
I have everything here.
The TV...
I see the entire world.
- Do you watch too?
- No.
Tell me about your house, husband... children...
- Or about you?
- Mom...
My husband and daughter are dead.
I have no home anymore.
I heard about it.
I was happy before.
I loved them and they loved me.
Mom, are you listening to me?
I am listening to, Marie-France.
Now I have only one thing left to do:
Nothing.
I don't want anymore friends, belongings, love.
Those are all traps.
Do you have money, my child?
To get by?
- Yes I have enough.
- That's important.
You can't give up everything.
- Mom?
- Yes?
Was I afraid of mice during my child days?
You weren't.
Julie was afraid.
I'm afraid now.
Thank you.
- Nice to see you.
Come in.
- Can I ask you something?
- My wife is out.
Please come in.
- Can you lend me your cat?
- Excuse me?
- Cat.
For a few days.
It is not castrated.
It can be aggressive.
I am not sure it likes you.
- What are you doing here?
- I saw you from the bus.
You were running like crazy.
Are you crying?
It is the water.
- You don't wear underwear?
- Never.
I borrowed the cat from the neighbour, to kill the mice.
It had babies.
It's normal, Julie.
Are you afraid to go back?
I'll go clean up.
I'll see you at my place.
It's Lucille.
Take a taxi here.
I will pay you back.
- Now?
It is late.
- 23.30.
You have 25 minutes.
It's important.
I can't.
I beg you.
I never asked you for anything.
Please come.
Where?
Cita de Midi 3.
Near Pigalle.
First door on the left.
There's a buzzer.
Say it's for me.
You'll come?
I am here for Lucille.
You came.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
- Are you angry?
- No.
We are on in 5 minutes.
Get me ready.
After I changed, I came here for a drink.
I looked around the audience, for no reason.
In the middle... of the first row, I saw my father.
He seemed tired.
And sleepy.
But he was starring a girl's ass.
the shithead who let you in wouldn't make him leave.
He told me, that if he pays, he has a right to watch.
I didn't know who I could count on.
I was desperate.
I didn't know who to talk to.
- That's why I phoned you.
- And your father?
10 minutes ago, he looked at his watch and left.
At 23.45 is the last train to Montpellier.
Why do you do this?
Because I like to.
I think everybody likes to.
- You saved my life.
- I didn't do anything.
- I asked you to come and you did.
- No.
Julie...
Isn't that you?
Lucille, we are on.
It's me.
European Council proposes you to finish the composition of Patrice De Courcy.
I agreed.
I am working on it now.
I'm trying to understand Patrice.
It's not easy.
Can you tell something about this score, shown here for the very first time?
It's the first part of the concert Patrice composed, commisssioned by the European Council.
The concert was to be played just once by twelve symphonic orchestras in the 12 EU cities.
Patrice was a secretive man.
Only his wife, Julie, would understand him.
I tried asking her to participate in this program, but she refused.
I assume that these documents are from your archives.
No, they are not archives.
Who can predict...?
They are photos and documents which I found in his desk at the Conservatory.
His wife didn't want them.
I am not sure I should show them.
He was a great man.
One of the most important composers of our time.
People like him belong to everybody.
I'll be five minutes.
Where did I put it?
A green calling card.
- Did you watch TV today?
- No.
I found it.
Her number at home and at work.
Why do you need this?
Today, on TV, she showed the scores I took from you.
After the accident, when nothing was sure, I made a copy.
When you picked it up, I knew you'd destroy it.
- I kept the copy and sent it to Strasbourg.
- Why did you do that?
The music is so beautiful.
You can't destroy things like that.
Olivier!
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
- I heard you're finishing Patrice's concert.
- I thought I could try...
You can't.
You have no right.
It won't be the same.
I said I'd try.
I don't know if I'll finish.
I'll tell you why.
It was a way...
that's what I thought, to make you cry, run.
The only way of making you say, "I want" or "I don't want".
- It's not fair.
- You didn't leave me any choice.
- You have no right to.
- You want to see what I've done?
I'm not sure I understood.
If I could play for you...
Do you know what the chorus sings?
I thought Patrice had told you.
In Greek, the rhythm is different.
- Who was that girl?
- What girl?
In the photos on the program.
She was with Patrice.
Didn't you know?
Just tell me, were they together?
Yes.
Since when?
Several years.
- Where does she live?
- Near Montparnasse.
They often met at the courts.
She is a lawyer.
Or she works for one.
What do you want to do?
Meet her.
Excuse me.
What about equality?
Is it because I don't speak French that the court won't hear my case?
Excuse me.
Yes?
- You were my husband's mistress?
- Yes.
I didn't know.
I just found out.
It's a shame.
Now you'll hate him, and me too.
I don't know...
Of course you will.
It is his child?
Yes.
But he didn't know.
I found out after the accident.
I didn't want a child but it happened.
Now I want to keep it.
Do you have a cigarette?
You shouldn't.
Do you want to know when and where?
No.
- You want to know if he loved me?
- Yes, that was my question.
Why ask, I know he loved you.
Yes.
He loved me.
Julie...
Will you hate me now?
Come in.
What happened?
You met her?
Once you asked me to take Patrice's papers.
- You didn't want to.
- No, but if I had...
- The photos were among them?
- Yes.
If I had taken them, I'd have known.
And if I had burned them, I'd never have known.
That's right.
Maybe it's better this way.
Can you show me what you've composed?
- These are violins?
- The altos.
And now...
Wait a second.
Lighter, without the percussions.
Lets remove the trumpets.
- Instead of a piano...
- A Flute?
Flute...
Start back here.
That's as far as I got.
- And the finale?
- I don't know.
There was a paper.
The counterpoint was supposed to come back.
He told me, it is memento.
Try weaving it back in.
Van den Budenmayer?
He wanted to allude to him at the end.
You know how much he loved him.
- Are you still in touch with our lawyer?
- Sometimes.
- Did he sell the house yet?
- I don't know.
- I doubt it.
He'd have called.
- Tell him not to.
If you can handle all this, will you show me?
Yes.
There was a mattress inside.
Mr Olivier bought it.
- I didn't think you would need it.
- That's fine.
Good morning.
Have you been here before?
No.
Never.
Upstairs are the bedrooms and the office.
I'll show you them later.
This is the Kitchen.
It's always been like this.
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Boy.
Have you chosen a name?
Yes.
I thought... he should have his name and his house.
- Do you still need me?
- No, you can go home.
Thank you.
- I knew it.
- What?
- Patrice told me a lot about you.
- Really?
like what?
That you are good.
That's what you want to be.
People can always count on you.
Even me.
I'm sorry.
It's me.
I finished.
Come pick it up tomorrow.
Or now, if you're not too tired.
I'm not tired.
But I will not come for the score.
What?
I won't pick it up.
I've been thinking it for a week.
This music can be mine.
A little heavy and awkward, but mine.
Or yours, but everyone would have to know.
Are you there?
Yes.
You're right.
It's me.
I wanted to ask you.
You really sleep on the mattress?
Yes.
- You never told me.
- No I didn't.
Do you still love me?
I love you.
Are you alone?
Of course I'm alone.
I am coming.
If I can talk like angel,
And I have no love,
I will be a copper ringing.
If I can prophesy
And if I have no love
I will be nothing.
Love is patient.
Love is kind.
It bears all things.
And knows everything.
Love never ends.
Prophecy - gone.
If languages - silent.
Knowledge - nothing.
Prophecy - gone.
Languages - silent.
And only stays
Faith, hope and love
But the biggest one from this three
is love.
Excuse me sir, i know you've been waiting for an answer from the states.
Mr. David sloan has unwisely declined your generous offer.
Just what did he say?
He was inclined not to want to cooperate.
What did he say?
Sir, he said it would bra cold day on mars before he would ever kiss your ass and that you could kiss his.
How unfortunate for mr.
Sloan to misunderstand the business policies of the negaal federation.
You have 48 hours in which to eliminate mr.
Sloan and enlist the new american kickboxing champion.
Of course.
1, 2, 3, 4!
5!
6!
7!
8!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Flower.
Excellent.
Enough.
That's it for today.
Attention.
Movement without spirit is nothing.
Movement without spirit is nothing.
That's right.
See you on tuesday.
Practice.
Hey, chalky.
Hey, matt, did you read the paper today?
No.
Why?
Look at this.
David sloan was murdered last night.
What happened?
Well, i don't know.
It says here it wasn't robbery;
he still had his wallet.
Could i see that?
Matt, anything you want me to do?
Send flowers to his family?
Yeah.
Please.
Thanks.
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event... you listening?
Hey, you listening?
Yeah, yeah.
I want you to pace yourself, you got it?
Hey, matt.
Hey, close the door, will ya?
There's a draft.
You want to freeze the kid?
What's up, gus?
Hey, matt, you're here, man.
This is great.
Of course i'm here.
I just hope you're not wasting my time.
You kidding?
I give him 2 rounds.
6 years, matt.
You know, you said it would take 10 before i won the belt.
Johnny, you haven't won yet.
I won't let you down.
I know.
Hey, hey, do you mind?
We got a fight to get ready for.
Sorry, gus.
Now you just watch his right heel kick, all right?
All right.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Mike.
Hey, matt?
Sorry about david sloan.
Yeah, me, too.
He was a good guy.
Hey, you keep your hands up, all right?
This one's for david!
Keep your hands up!
Stay strong, stay strong!
Hands up... matty, glad you could make it.
Hello, max.
I wish it was you in there.
Boy, you brought in the bucks.
Don't get me wrong.
I think what you're doing is very noble, sharing your impeccable skills with your students.
It's new blood.
But, damn it, you could have made a lot of bread.
There's no money in kickboxing, max, at least not for the fighters.
Hey, your kid gonna win?
And does it really matter?
You make money either way.
As long as it's bloody.
Good-bye, max.
Come on, johnny.
Get up.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
Aah!
Yeah!
Go, johnny!
There you go!
There you go!
Yes!
Strong, johnny!
There you go!
Yaah!
He's out, he's out.
Johnny styles.
Whew!
All right.
Good job, man.
Good job.
Oh, man, you had me scared in the first round.
I wasn't worried at all.
I'm telling you, i wasn't worried.
See the fear in his eyes?
- Oh, yeah, i did.
Johnny styles.
I have something of the utmost importance for you.
It's an invitation to join the negaal kickboxing federation and a first-class ticket to johannesburg, south africa to meet with mr.
Negaal.
Negaal kickboxing federation?
Never heard of it.
It's new.
But everybody's joining it.
Wow, matt.
Africa.
Let me see that.
Mr. Negaal formed the organization to bring order out of chaos.
One organization, one set of rules, one leader.
Every fighter must join.
"Federation rules: wins by non signatory fighters
"will be regarded as universally unofficial and therefore void from record."
What does it mean?
It means if you don't join, your win tonight doesn't count.
What, can they do that?
No.
Don't worry about it.
It's toilet paper.
We'd like to have a meeting with you later on tonight, johnny, at the penthouse in the mid wilshire hotel... to discuss your meeting with mr.
Negaal.
Well, it doesn't cost anything to check it out, right?
I suppose not.
Ok, cool.
I'll see you tonight then.
Good.
Oh, johnny, this is serious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Protect this car with your life.
Yes, sir.
Nice car.
Thanks.
How lovely.
Hi.
Matt, could i talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, sure, chalky.
Come on in.
Are you hungry?
Nah.
You know those guys that you said were talking to johnny?
This, uh, negaal something or other?
Yeah?
Well, word is, those guys also had a talk to david sloan about joining up.
Oh, you know david, he's not one to put up with anybody's shit.
Well, this was just 2 days before they found him dead.
Johnny.
Hey, matt!
If i sign this, i give negaal control over everything... commercials, public appearances, endorsements.
I'd need his permission to go to the bathroom.
11 international champions have already joined the negaal kickboxing federation, johnny.
They can do what they want, but like my trainer matt says, this is toilet paper.
Well, then... if you'll excuse me, mr.
Styles.
Gentlemen, i'll leave you to it.
Mr. Styles, mr.
Negaal makes an offer once and only once.
This opportunity won't be repeated.
Yeah, well, no one's gonna make me sign a piece of paper to keep my belt.
I won it with these, and that's the way i plan to keep it.
And that's your final answer?
Yeah, 'fraid so.
Our apologies if we offended you, mr.
Styles.
Maybe some other time, huh, perhaps?
Whoa!
What the... reeves.
Man.
Johnny!
Whoa!
Reeves.
Come on, come on.
Go.
Come on, my boy.
I've got something for you.
Come on.
Aah!
Jeez.
Pinto.
Ohh...
- bull!
Get in the car!
Now!
Let's get out of here!
What about him?
Just drive!
Johnny?
What happened, man?
You were right.
You were right.
It was toilet paper.
Get 'em, matt.
Promise.
Promise you'll stop them.
Johnny?
We've got to get to a hospital!
I ain't driving around with this guy all over my roof.
Shut up, both of you!
Hey!
This thing doesn't work!
Yeah?
Try talking to the guy with the antenna up his ass.
Oh, bull, you've really screwed up big-league this time.
Ok.
Pull over!
We've got to get pinto to a hospital.
Shut up.
Hello?
Long-distance.
Yeah.
Get me johannesburg.
He fell on my car.
Yeah, south africa!
Double-1, double-8-0,2, triple 6.
All right, gentlemen, if that concludes the day's reports.
There is one small problem.
This kickboxing federation of yours is meeting resistance.
All resistance is being taken care of.
By killing them?
You don't approve of my methods, jack?
We're making a fortune with gambling, drugs, and prostitution.
Why screw it up with the kickboxing federation?
It's los angeles, sir.
Tell them to hold.
I'm busy.
We can take all that cash and put it.
Into parking corporations in the states.
Do you realize how much money we could launder?
With that in mind, kickboxing just doesn't make sense.
Doesn't make sense?
The world kickboxing council accused me of unsportsmanlike conduct when i killed a dutch champion in the ring.
And just so you know it, jack, it was a legitimate strike.
Hmm.
I formed the negaal kickboxing federation to protect the art and the sport against small minds, and now you have a problem with this?
What doesn't make sense?
No, i... i was just... i'm gonna break the world kickboxing council.
You got that?
Mr. Negaal, i'm only trying to serve your interests.
Arguing with me doesn't serve my interests, jack.
Gentlemen... please excuse me.
I... have an important call.
Yes, what is it?
Gentlemen, shall we?
Johnny styles... has met an unfortunate end.
What?
Matt reeves?
A job well done, moon.
Idiot.
We'll take care of it from here.
Get back immediately.
Bull?
We've been called back to jo-burg.
Negaal, voice-over: we have a situation on our hands.
I want matt reeves eliminated.
You can't touch him.
Everyone knows him.
He was undefeated in his weight class.
I don't care who he is.
He's a witness.
I want him eliminated.
You have a problem with that, jack?
I didn't think so.
You know, boss, we have the perfect guy for the job in los angeles.
Isn't he in jail?
We can get him out.
We have a judge on the payroll.
I though this confinement to maximum security suited you.
Yeah, i was a handsome man before he did this to me... but i wouldn't mind seeing him again.
He made a fool of you the last time you fought.
Yeah.
You're lucky to be alive.
Ha ha ha!
Yeah!
Hey, let's go check him out.
There's a gang war coming down.
You're either with us or against us.
Doing my own time my way.
Don't want any trouble.
Man, maybe trouble wants you.
I don't fight anymore.
What's the matter, croft?
You lost your balls?
Yeah, so go find someone else.
Who says we're giving you a choice in this, man?
Aah!
I told you i don't fight.
But when a dog bites... that's afrikaans for "rest in peace."
Croft!
Let him go.
Warden wants to see you.
Just sign there.
What's this?
It was with your things.
You're talking about organized crime based overseas.
These murders aren't just impossible to prove, they're impossible to do anything about without getting interpol involved.
For that, you need evidence, and all you've got, kid, is speculation.
Mr. Reeves.
I'm sorry about your friends.
Thanks.
All right.
Chalky?
I've been sent to kill you.
Well, here i am.
If i were gonna kill you, you'd already be dead.
And when he finds out i didn't, he'll send someone else.
And he'll keep on sending people until you are dead.
You came here to tell me that?
Who are you?
Your emotions have taken over.
You're vulnerable.
He likes that.
Who killed my friends?
You know who killed them.
Negaal.
Well, where are you going?
I'm going home.
You sure you want to do this, kid?
I mean, those sons of bitches are the real thing.
Just like in the old days.
They're killers, matt.
Chalky... they were my friends.
I'm going.
Matt... you come home alive, kid.
I will.
Woman, over p.a. system: good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard flight 297, offering nonstop service to johannesburg.
The captain has turned on the seat belt sign, so if you could please take your seats, we can prepare for takeoff.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'd like to change my seat.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
The flight is full, but if you'll take your seat, i'll see what i can do after takeoff.
So why you?
I was convenient.
Just out of curiosity, what's the going rate to bump me off?
Plane ticket?
You were gonna waste me for a lousy plane ride?
It's first-class.
Well, now that you've disobeyed orders, what's gonna happen to you?
And why go back to johannesburg?
South africa is my home.
Nobody's gonna keep me away.
Oh, i see.
And you're gonna slip right back into negaal's backyard and live a nice, quiet life, right?
I'd worry about your own ass if i were you.
Why?
He doesn't even know i'm coming.
Well, moon, at least you got the belt.
I want you to pick up croft from the airport.
Of course, sir.
And, moon?
Don't break the other leg.
Too much lime.
Sorry, sir.
It's time for you to get lost.
Excuse me?
You're looking well.
Why the welcoming party?
I wanted to welcome you personally.
Mr. Negaal will, of course, be expecting a full report.
Well, you'd better start thinking about what you're gonna tell him.
Unh!
Get him!
Watch it!
Excuse me!
Coming through!
Coming through!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hey!
Which way did they go?
That way.
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.
Back.
Stay back.
Aargh!
Ooh!
Hey!
Aah!
You again!
Hello.
Reeves!
Aah!
Aah!
You can't take all 3 of us... at the same time.
Come on.
Get up, croft.
Let's go.
Let's get them.
Ohh!
Now they know i'm here.
And alive.
How do you think you're gonna find negaal?
I've got his letter to my friend johnny.
There's an address in downtown johannesburg i'm gonna check out.
You're looking for a way to get yourself killed.
I'm looking for a way to live.
Yeah?
Well, then, i guess this is where we part company.
I guess so.
Thanks for your help back at the airport.
Thanks for not killing me.
Good luck.
You, too.
See you around.
Good help is so difficult to find these days.
This guy reeves is different.
He's far more dangerous than the others.
Tito, what does that sound like to you?
It sounds like an excuse.
Matt reeves has made a fool of you yet again, moon.
And, bollen, croft was your idea.
Now he's betrayed me, and now we have two problems.
Excuse me, sir.
There is a mr.
Rochambeau to see you.
Ah, yes.
The french champion.
I'll just be a moment.
Sir.
The undefeated matt reeves in south africa.
I wonder.
Put out the word.
Have him found.
Have him killed.
Mr. Bollen.
Mr. Moon.
How do i feel about excuses?
You hate them, boss.
And how do i deal with them?
Try him?
Severely?
No!
I deal with them lethally.
Now, don't fail me again.
Mr. Rochambeau.
You are negaal?
I am.
I have heard so much about you.
All good, i hope.
Unfortunately, no.
An honest man.
I like that.
As long as you've come to sign with my federation.
I have heard of the, uh, misfortune of those who refuse.
You haven't answered my question.
I would be honored if your federation would endorse my title and represent me.
No, it would be my honor.
Take care of our guest.
See that he has everything he needs till his return to paris.
I'll have a contract brought to you.
That makes 15 champions.
You see, tito, they're all falling into line like sheep.
There you go.
Thanks.
Enjoy your stay in johannesburg, mr.
Reeves.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
And a thousand.
And nobody's fool in the fifth.
I've got to go now.
Bye.
Good morning, sir.
May i help you?
Morning.
How you doing?
Aha.
An american.
West coast.
Am i right?
You're very good.
I'm fantastic with accent.
Yes, you are.
I'm a little confused.
I thought this was where to find the negaal kickboxing federation.
Do i have the right address?
May i see that?
Sure.
What is it that you need?
I have some business with mr.
Negaal.
Oh, well, maybe i can help you.
All right.
Where can i find mr.
Negaal?
Oh.
Well, i'm afraid mr.
Negaal has just found you.
Heh!
And your plan is to take me to him, right?
Yeah.
I got a car waiting for us outside.
No thanks.
I think i'll find my own ride.
Oh, really?
Ooh!
Get him!
Outside!
He took off out the back.
Find him.
And when you do, hurt him!
Now i've got you.
Damn it!
Unh!
Aah!
Yah!
Ohh!
I thought you were on your way home.
So i took the scenic route.
Stand your ground, you pathetic wimps!
There's only two of them!
Bollen!
Croft.
Unh!
Get them!
Kill them!
Aah!
Unh!
Unh!
I can't... hey!
Hey!
Help me!
Help me!
Ohh.
Freeze!
Hands on the car.
Get your hands on the car.
Spread your feet.
Come on, now!
Are these the men?
Yes, sir.
They beat me up, and they robbed me.
Oh, he's lying.
He and his goons attacked me and my friend.
Are these the same men who robbed your shop?
Don't be afraid to tell the truth.
You shut up.
Well, not exactly.
Not exactly?
That's not what you told us.
There was a big fight, you see, and there was a lot of damage in my shop, and... are these the men who started the trouble or not?
Yes.
What?
Wait a second.
Come, let's go.
Take them in.
I don't believe this.
Thanks, sir.
You have a good day, now, huh?
You did well.
So what happens to us?
Are there charges?
A telephone call, maybe?
After your transfer.
Transfer?
Hey!
What transfer?
This jail is full.
Tomorrow morning, the most serious offenders will be taken to a mobile prison.
Prison?
And what do you mean, "serious offenders"?
I can't learn to mind my own business.
Hey, we didn't do anything, all right?
We were just defending ourselves.
I just spent 3 years behind bars.
I don't need this.
Don't worry.
We'll get out.
Ohh.
We just need a chance to tell our side of the story.
I should have taken the deal and murdered you when i had the chance.
Thank you, croft.
That's very nice of you.
Gentlemen, please.
In a small space like this, we have no choice but to get along.
I'm joseph mabuza.
So what are you in for, joseph?
A small misunderstanding with a customs inspector.
A few pounds of baby powder i purchased turned out to be, well, not exactly baby powder.
An innocent mistake but one with drastic consequences.
Joseph.
Here's that copy of "the hard times" that you wanted.
Thanks, peter.
I knew i could count on you.
Enjoy your book.
Bonded irish whiskey.
Mmm.
Nothing like it.
Can i offer you gentlemen a drink?
No thanks.
We're sitting ducks in here.
We've got to find a way out.
Then how do you plan to pay for the special service?
We'll owe you.
Hey.
Don't insult my intelligence.
Mabuza... you ever hear of a man named negaal?
Who in south africa hasn't?
He's a butcher, a madman.
His charm and intelligence make him more dangerous than a cobra.
Yeah, well... he wants to kill us.
Well, you're practically dead already.
Negaal knows we're here.
We'll be lucky if we live until morning.
And since you are in this cell with us... ohh.
I see.
I guess i'd better make the arrangements.
And i need to contact somebody on the outside.
Peter.
You don't like the book?
Message service, please.
This must be delivered immediately.
There's an extra charge for express services.
Fine.
Just do it.
Are reeves and croft dead?
Not exactly.
Not exactly?
What does that mean?
Well, i have some good news.
They're as good as dead.
Nothing's as good as dead.
What are we gonna tell him?
Nothing.
They're in jail.
I've got someone on the inside.
I know that whistle.
It's busi.
That means there's gonna bra cocktail party.
It's one of negaal's men.
Hi, joseph.
Still awake?
You can't sleep?
It's a hot night.
Oh, well.
It's gonna get hotter.
Hey, shut up.
Shut up.
I said, shut up.
A waste of wonderful whiskey, but it was worth it.
At least you're safe from mr.
Negaal.
Yeah, for a couple hours.
Wake him up.
Croft.
Well, joseph, i hope we didn't cause you too much trouble.
I have enemies in the mobile prison.
My transfer there would have been, shall we say, hazardous to my health.
Thanks, joseph.
Sure.
I wouldn't stay here too long if i were you, gentlemen.
Good luck, and godspeed.
Come on!
Let's get them!
Come on!
We've got them!
This way.
Look there!
There she is.
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go!
Hi, paul.
Heh!
It's been a while.
So who's your friend?
Just drive.
Beautiful animal.
Gentlemen?
It wasn't our fault this time.
Stupid prison guard screwed up.
I assigned all 3 of you to croft and reeves, and now they're running around the country like they own it!
We'll get them next time, mr.
Negaal, sir.
I'll stake my life on it.
Do you have nothing more valuable, moon?
Mr. Bull told me how you mishandled the situation at the airport.
But croft was bollen's idea!
Don't blame me.
You should have killed reeves in the first place!
Someone has to pay for these absurd mistakes.
Boss.
Jeez.
But it was moon who messed up.
I need moon.
Bull was just muscle.
Think about that, mr.
Bollen.
Get this useless sack out of here.
You want to tell me where we're headed?
Home.
Why?
What's there?
Safety.
Pull over!
Please.
Haven't you figured it out yet?
I don't want safety.
I want negaal.
So do you, croft.
You want negaal as bad as i do, but you're afraid of him, of getting involved.
You think he's just gonna forget about you?
You screwed him over.
He'll hunt you down, and after he's killed you and your family, he'll find someone else to murder.
We have to stop him.
If we don't and another person dies, it's our fault.
What is going on?
Who is this guy?
God damn pain in the ass, that's who he is.
Matt, wait!
Wait!
Do you even know where you are?
You're in a foreign country.
You got no money.
We got the police after us with dogs.
You're in the middle of a god damn spinach patch.
You think you're gonna find negaal out here?
All right.
I'll help you, but you don't know negaal.
I do.
Let's go back to my home and get ourselves together.
Then we'll come up with a plan.
All right.
All right.
Angie, this is matt reeves.
He'll be staying with us for a couple of days.
Hi, angie.
Hi.
Are you negaal?
I understand you don't approve of my title.
The federation doesn't recognize you until you recognize the federation.
Well, i hardly think you have anything to say in the matter.
Well, perhaps you'd like to prove how good you are.
How good i am?
Against whom?
Oh, i don't know.
Me.
You?
Ha ha ha!
Heh heh heh.
Well, perhaps it might provide a minute or two of amusement and teach you some respect for your superiors.
Well, it's a lovely day out there.
Perhaps you'd like to give me this lesson on the lawn?
On the lawn?
Ha!
Ja.
Gut.
On the lawn.
Ohh!
Ha ha ha!
Huh?
You want to fight?
Huh?
Ha ha ha!
Huh?
You want some more?
Unh!
Ohh!
I concede.
You're a great fighter.
I acknowledge your superiority.
The opportunity for that was earlier.
A challenge to me is a challenge to the death.
What?
Are you insane?
Come.
Come.
Come!
You are joking.
Haah!
I represent the new, higher standard of world kickboxing.
You represent the old.
Hey, gents.
You must watch this.
The tiger claw.
It's good, it's good.
He'll crush his throat.
Ohh!
Good fight, boss.
Good fight!
Not too much lime this time, sir?
Better.
Gentlemen, good afternoon.
I'm going for a swim.
And, uh, please don't forget, my place tomorrow night.
We're celebrating the formation of our new empire, the negaal federation.
Champagne, gambling, entertainment.
It's all on me.
Well, gentlemen.
Ahem.
So much for art in the park.
Who knows what dinner will bring?
Shall we?
Ahem.
So how long have you two been together?
Since birth.
He's my brother.
You know, i really thought that you two were... look.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
What is going on?
And this time, i want an answer.
Do you know of a man named negaal?
I know he's the reason paul hasn't been home for the past 5 years.
Well, he murdered two of my friends, and the police can't touch him.
And just what are you gonna do about it?
Stop him... and carry out a promise i made to a friend.
And you're going with him?
I have to.
Dad would beery proud of you, paul.
Look.
I'm sorry, matt, but i love my brother, and i'm grateful he's home, but i can't let you pull him back into that world.
Angie, i'm not pulling him back.
It's his decision.
Our father died while his only son was in prison.
You know, maybe you need to have some faith.
Your brother is a good man.
You know you can't go up against negaal and bollen.
Bollen hates you for what you did to him.
They'll kill you if you get in their way.
Please, paul, just leave them alone.
I'm already in their way, angie.
Negaal's put the word out to have matt and me killed.
Paul, no.
This isn't just gonna go away.
For all the terrible things i've done in my life, now's the chance for me to redeem myself.
I've got to help him.
By going after negaal?
Yes.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thanks.
Pleasure.
Angie, he will be back.
I know he'll be back.
I'm going with you.
Hyah!
Moon has secured the area, and there's tito with the investors.
This is a very important evening, bollen.
There are a lot of influential people here.
Don't worry, sir.
Everything's been arranged.
You better be right.
Ha ha ha!
Tito.
Welcome, gentlemen.welcome.
A couple of pictures.
Yes, sir, mr.
Negaal.
One for each of my guests.
Gentlemen, shall we?
Gonna have some fun tonight.
Let's go around the back.
All right.
Angie, i'm sorry.
You're gonna have to wait outside.
Paul, you said that i could... we need you out herewith the engine running.
If we're not back in half an hour, go home.
Matt, wait... angie, we'll be all right.
Yeah, right.
Gentlemen, a game of roulette.
Some chips for my guests.
Eagle eyes, buttie.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
How can we help you?
Ah, yes.
We're here for the party.
This is a private event.
Engraved invitations only.
Don't worry.
Mr. Negaal will be pleasantly surprised.
He's been looking all over town for us.
Thanks.
No invitation, no admission.
Besides, you're violating the dress code.
You have to wear a tux.
Oh.
Oh.
Dress code.
Dress code.
Beautiful animal.
Yeah.
Hey, sammy, george.
Munjani.
Is that him?
The one and only.
And there's your old friend bollen.
I don't know about you, but i think i'll try my luck.
Excuse me.
May i use this?
Yes, sir.
Money plays.
Reeves is here.
What?
Negaal is gonna kill me.
I'll get the others.
And zero wins.
Oh, that's ok.
Let it ride.
Yes, sir.
Betting again, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Hey, bollen.
Oh, croft.
I've been waiting a long time for this, buttie.
Your head looks good.
Thought i ripped that ear off.
You know, somebody threw it back into the ring after you left.
I spent 3 years in prison because of you, bollen.
You set me up!
Yeah?
Well, you would have been helpful to the organization had you killed reeves.
Now you're both dead.
Ain't not exactly hurting yet.
What a shame, huh?
How's the pain, buttie?
The gentleman wins again.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Well done.
Beginner's luck.
Can i, um, buy you a drink?
I'd love one, but it might not be such a good idea.
Why don't you let me worry about that?
Excuse me.
Who is this guy?
Good evening.
Why don't you pick a number, your favorite number?
35.
All right.
What about... all of it on 35?
Just who the hell are you?
Just another dude from the valley.
Of course.
You must be matt reeves.
You're not what i expected.
You're just a kid.
Well, you're exactly what i expected, a butt face.
You're a dead man, bollen.
Get up!
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
Please don't.
Ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, please?
I would just like to take this moment to congratulate mr.
Negaal and his newly founded negaal kickboxing federation.
The federation was formed because mr.
Negaal, a former kickboxer himself, was kicked out and banned from competition for using an illegal move and killing his opponent.
He now has his own organization... we need to get him out of here, tito.
Should they refuse, well, he kills them, too.
Two of my friends are dead because of this man.
At least they fought and died with dignity, which is more than most men do.
You're a gangster, a murderer, and a psychopath.
Anyone who's willing to be seen with you is dirt.
What you lack in intelligence you make up for in passion.
I like that.
Unfortunately, your friend johnny suffered the same dilemma.
To the house, tito.
I don't wish to be part of this undignified brawl.
If he's worthy of me, he'll come.
Hyah!
Again with spirit.
Hyah!
Aah!
Get him in close.
Come on.
Croft!
I'm going after negaal.
Call the cops.
I think it's time we found ourselves another job, huh?
Yeah.
Well, that party was a glittering success.
You can wave your empire good-bye.
Oh, really?
And why is that, tito.
Those international businessmen who were going to fund our worldwide expansion find your enthusiasm for martial arts a little... well, how shall i put it... dangerous.
I don't need them.
Do you think famous champions can disappear off the face of the earth and nobody will bloody notice?
It happens all the time.
Missing persons.
Oh, right.
Except they either got on a plane for south africa to join the negaal kickboxing federation or they received your letter on your letterhead inviting them to.
Enough!
We can discuss this some other time, tito.
Right now, i'm expecting someone.
Oh, yes.
Someone worthy.
You killed my friends.
You're right.
I did.
What do you think?
My collection of championship belts.
Isn't that something?
You're never gonna kill or hurt anyone again.
Dying to fight, are we?
Our time, mr.
Reeves, has come!
Aah!
No, reeves.
Not the belts.
They're mine.
I earned them.
Never have them.
You can't have them.
My... my... the police are on their way.
Let's wait outside.
Excuse me sir, i know you've been waiting for an answer from the states.
Mr. David sloan has unwisely declined your generous offer.
Just what did he say?
He was inclined not to want to cooperate.
What did he say?
Sir, he said it would bra cold day on mars before he would ever kiss your ass and that you could kiss his.
How unfortunate for mr.
Sloan to misunderstand the business policies of the negaal federation.
You have 48 hours in which to eliminate mr.
Sloan and enlist the new american kickboxing champion.
Of course.
[Man chuckling] [roaring]
man: 1, 2, 3, 4!
5!
6!
7!
8!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Flower.
Excellent.
Enough.
That's it for today.
Attention.
All: movement without spirit is nothing.
Movement without spirit is nothing.
That's right.
See you on tuesday.
Practice.
Hey, chalky.
Hey, matt, did you read the paper today?
No.
Why?
Look at this.
David sloan was murdered last night.
What happened?
Well, i don't know.
It says here it wasn't robbery;
he still had his wallet.
Could i see that?
Matt, anything you want me to do?
Send flowers to his family?
Yeah.
Please.
Thanks.
[Crowd cheering] [bell rings] all right.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event... you listening?
Hey, you listening?
Yeah, yeah.
I want you to pace yourself, you got it?
Hey, matt.
Hey, close the door, will ya?
There's a draft.
You want to freeze the kid?
What's up, gus?
Hey, matt, you're here, man.
This is great.
Of course i'm here.
I just hope you're not wasting my time.
You kidding?
I give him 2 rounds.
6 years, matt.
You know, you said it would take 10 before i won the belt.
Johnny, you haven't won yet.
I won't let you down.
I know.
Hey, hey, do you mind?
We got a fight to get ready for.
Sorry, gus.
Now you just watch his right heel kick, all right?
All right.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Mike.
Johnny: hey, matt?
Sorry about david sloan.
Yeah, me, too.
He was a good guy.
Hey, you keep your hands up, all right?
This one's for david!
[Bell rings] [both grunting] [crowd cheering]
keep your hands up!
Stay strong, stay strong!
Hands up... matty, glad you could make it.
Hello, max.
I wish it was you in there.
Boy, you brought in the bucks.
Don't get me wrong.
I think what you're doing is very noble, sharing your impeccable skills with your students.
It's new blood.
But, damn it, you could have made a lot of bread.
There's no money in kickboxing, max, at least not for the fighters.
Hey, your kid gonna win?
And does it really matter?
You make money either way.
As long as it's bloody.
Good-bye, max.
[Groaning] come on, johnny.
Get up.
Referee: 3.
4.
5.
[No audio] 6.
7.
8.
9.
Aah!
Yeah!
Go, johnny!
There you go!
[Crowd cheering]
matt: there you go!
Yes!
Strong, johnny!
There you go!
Yaah!
He's out, he's out.
[Ringing]
johnny styles.
Johnny: whew!
All right.
Good job, man.
Good job.
Oh, man, you had me scared in the first round.
Johnny: i wasn't worried at all.
I'm telling you, i wasn't worried.
See the fear in his eyes?
Matt: oh, yeah, i did.
Man: johnny styles.
I have something of the utmost importance for you.
It's an invitation to join the negaal kickboxing federation and a first-class ticket to johannesburg, south africa to meet with mr.
Negaal.
Negaal kickboxing federation?
Never heard of it.
It's new.
But everybody's joining it.
Wow, matt.
Africa.
Let me see that.
Mr. Negaal formed the organization to bring order out of chaos.
One organization, one set of rules, one leader.
Every fighter must join.
"Federation rules: wins by non signatory fighters
"will be regarded as universally unofficial and therefore void from record."
What does it mean?
Matt: it means if you don't join, your win tonight doesn't count.
What, can they do that?
No.
Don't worry about it.
Matt: it's toilet paper.
We'd like to have a meeting with you later on tonight, johnny, at the penthouse in the mid wilshire hotel... [chuckling] to discuss your meeting with mr.
Negaal.
Well, it doesn't cost anything to check it out, right?
I suppose not.
Ok, cool.
I'll see you tonight then.
Good.
Oh, johnny, this is serious.
Yeah.
[Mimicking] yeah.
Protect this car with your life.
Yes, sir.
Nice car.
Thanks.
[Elevator bell dings] johnny: how lovely.
Hi.
[Women giggling]
[knock knock knock] matt, could i talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, sure, chalky.
Come on in.
Are you hungry?
Nah.
You know those guys that you said were talking to johnny?
This, uh, negaal something or other?
Yeah?
Well, word is, those guys also had a talk to david sloan about joining up.
Oh, you know david, he's not one to put up with anybody's shit.
Well, this was just 2 days before they found him dead.
[Sighs] johnny.
Hey, matt!
[Sighs]
johnny: if i sign this, i give negaal control over everything... commercials, public appearances, endorsements.
I'd need his permission to go to the bathroom.
11 international champions have already joined the negaal kickboxing federation, johnny.
They can do what they want, but like my trainer matt says, this is toilet paper.
Well, then... if you'll excuse me, mr.
Styles.
Gentlemen, i'll leave you to it.
Mr. Styles, mr.
Negaal makes an offer once and only once.
This opportunity won't be repeated.
Yeah, well, no one's gonna make me sign a piece of paper to keep my belt.
I won it with these, and that's the way i plan to keep it.
And that's your final answer?
Yeah, 'fraid so.
Our apologies if we offended you, mr.
Styles.
Maybe some other time, huh, perhaps?
Johnny: whoa!
[Motorcycle approaching]
what the... reeves.
Man.
Johnny!
Whoa!
[Crunch]
reeves.
Come on, come on.
Go.
Come on, my boy.
I've got something for you.
Come on.
[Whimpering] aah!
Jeez.
Pinto.
Ohh...
man: bull!
Get in the car!
Now!
Let's get out of here!
Driver: what about him?
Just drive!
Johnny?
What happened, man?
You were right.
You were right.
It was toilet paper.
Get 'em, matt.
Promise.
Promise you'll stop them.
Johnny?
Bull: we've got to get to a hospital!
Driver: i ain't driving around with this guy all over my roof.
Shut up, both of you!
Hey!
This thing doesn't work!
Yeah?
Try talking to the guy with the antenna up his ass.
Oh, bull, you've really screwed up big-league this time.
Ok.
Pull over!
We've got to get pinto to a hospital.
Shut up.
Hello?
Long-distance.
Yeah.
Get me johannesburg.
He fell on my car.
Yeah, south africa!
Double-1, double-8-0,2, triple 6.
All right, gentlemen, if that concludes the day's reports.
There is one small problem.
This kickboxing federation of yours is meeting resistance.
All resistance is being taken care of.
By killing them?
You don't approve of my methods, jack?
We're making a fortune with gambling, drugs, and prostitution.
Why screw it up with the kickboxing federation?
Man: it's los angeles, sir.
Tell them to hold.
Negaal: i'm busy.
Jack: we can take all that cash and put it.
Into parking corporations in the states.
Do you realize how much money we could launder?
With that in mind, kickboxing just doesn't make sense.
Doesn't make sense?
The world kickboxing council accused me of unsportsmanlike conduct when i killed a dutch champion in the ring.
And just so you know it, jack, it was a legitimate strike.
Hmm.
I formed the negaal kickboxing federation to protect the art and the sport against small minds, and now you have a problem with this?
What doesn't make sense?
No, i... i was just... i'm gonna break the world kickboxing council.
You got that?
Jack: mr.
Negaal, i'm only trying to serve your interests.
Arguing with me doesn't serve my interests, jack.
[Breathlessly] gentlemen... please excuse me.
I... have an important call.
[Phone beeps] yes, what is it?
Gentlemen, shall we?
Johnny styles... has met an unfortunate end.
What?
Matt reeves?
[Scoffs] a job well done, moon.
Idiot.
We'll take care of it from here.
Get back immediately.
Moon: bull?
We've been called back to jo-burg.
Negaal, voice-over: we have a situation on our hands.
I want matt reeves eliminated.
You can't touch him.
Everyone knows him.
He was undefeated in his weight class.
I don't care who he is.
He's a witness.
I want him eliminated.
You have a problem with that, jack?
I didn't think so.
You know, boss, we have the perfect guy for the job in los angeles.
Isn't he in jail?
We can get him out.
We have a judge on the payroll.
I though this confinement to maximum security suited you.
Yeah, i was a handsome man before he did this to me... but i wouldn't mind seeing him again.
He made a fool of you the last time you fought.
Yeah.
Negaal: you're lucky to be alive.
Man: ha ha ha!
Yeah!
Hey, let's go check him out.
There's a gang war coming down.
You're either with us or against us.
Doing my own time my way.
Don't want any trouble.
Man, maybe trouble wants you.
I don't fight anymore.
What's the matter, croft?
You lost your balls?
Yeah, so go find someone else.
Who says we're giving you a choice in this, man?
Aah!
I told you i don't fight.
But when a dog bites... [speaking afrikaans] that's afrikaans for "rest in peace."
Man: croft!
[High-pitched whistle] let him go.
Warden wants to see you.
Just sign there.
What's this?
It was with your things.
You're talking about organized crime based overseas.
These murders aren't just impossible to prove, they're impossible to do anything about without getting interpol involved.
For that, you need evidence, and all you've got, kid, is speculation.
Mr. Reeves.
I'm sorry about your friends.
Thanks.
[Exclaims] [panting]
all right.
Matt: chalky?
[Yelling] i've been sent to kill you.
Well, here i am.
If i were gonna kill you, you'd already be dead.
And when he finds out i didn't, he'll send someone else.
And he'll keep on sending people until you are dead.
You came here to tell me that?
Who are you?
Your emotions have taken over.
You're vulnerable.
He likes that.
Who killed my friends?
You know who killed them.
Negaal.
Well, where are you going?
I'm going home.
[Door opens]
you sure you want to do this, kid?
I mean, those sons of bitches are the real thing.
Just like in the old days.
They're killers, matt.
Chalky... they were my friends.
[Zipper zipping] i'm going.
Matt... you come home alive, kid.
I will.
[Door opens, closes] woman, over p.a. system: good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard flight 297, offering nonstop service to johannesburg.
The captain has turned on the seat belt sign, so if you could please take your seats, we can prepare for takeoff.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'd like to change my seat.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
The flight is full, but if you'll take your seat, i'll see what i can do after takeoff.
So why you?
I was convenient.
Just out of curiosity, what's the going rate to bump me off?
Plane ticket?
You were gonna waste me for a lousy plane ride?
It's first-class.
Well, now that you've disobeyed orders, what's gonna happen to you?
And why go back to johannesburg?
South africa is my home.
Nobody's gonna keep me away.
Oh, i see.
And you're gonna slip right back into negaal's backyard and live a nice, quiet life, right?
I'd worry about your own ass if i were you.
Why?
He doesn't even know i'm coming.
Well, moon, at least you got the belt.
Negaal: i want you to pick up croft from the airport.
Of course, sir.
And, moon?
Don't break the other leg.
Too much lime.
Sorry, sir.
It's time for you to get lost.
Excuse me?
[Banging on door]
[woman speaking indistinctly on p.a.]
you're looking well.
Why the welcoming party?
I wanted to welcome you personally.
Mr. Negaal will, of course, be expecting a full report.
Well, you'd better start thinking about what you're gonna tell him.
Unh!
Get him!
Watch it!
Paul: excuse me!
Coming through!
Coming through!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hey!
[People murmuring] which way did they go?
That way.
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.
Back.
Stay back.
Aargh!
[Grunting] ooh!
Hey!
Aah!
You again!
Hello.
[Both grunting]
reeves!
Aah!
Aah!
You can't take all 3 of us... at the same time.
[Shouting]
come on.
Get up, croft.
Let's go.
Let's get them.
Ohh!
Now they know i'm here.
And alive.
Paul: how do you think you're gonna find negaal?
I've got his letter to my friend johnny.
There's an address in downtown johannesburg i'm gonna check out.
You're looking for a way to get yourself killed.
I'm looking for a way to live.
Yeah?
Well, then, i guess this is where we part company.
I guess so.
Thanks for your help back at the airport.
Thanks for not killing me.
Good luck.
You, too.
See you around.
Negaal: good help is so difficult to find these days.
This guy reeves is different.
He's far more dangerous than the others.
Tito, what does that sound like to you?
It sounds like an excuse.
Matt reeves has made a fool of you yet again, moon.
And, bollen, croft was your idea.
Now he's betrayed me, and now we have two problems.
Man: excuse me, sir.
There is a mr.
Rochambeau to see you.
Ah, yes.
The french champion.
I'll just be a moment.
Sir.
The undefeated matt reeves in south africa.
I wonder.
Put out the word.
Have him found.
Have him killed.
Mr. Bollen.
Mr. Moon.
How do i feel about excuses?
You hate them, boss.
And how do i deal with them?
Try him?
Severely?
No!
I deal with them lethally.
Now, don't fail me again.
Mr. Rochambeau.
You are negaal?
I am.
I have heard so much about you.
All good, i hope.
Unfortunately, no.
An honest man.
I like that.
As long as you've come to sign with my federation.
I have heard of the, uh, misfortune of those who refuse.
You haven't answered my question.
I would be honored if your federation would endorse my title and represent me.
No, it would be my honor.
Take care of our guest.
See that he has everything he needs till his return to paris.
I'll have a contract brought to you.
That makes 15 champions.
You see, tito, they're all falling into line like sheep.
There you go.
Thanks.
Enjoy your stay in johannesburg, mr.
Reeves.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
[Drumming] [rooster crows]
[bell ringing]
[man speaking foreign language]
[bell rings] woman: and a thousand.
And nobody's fool in the fifth.
I've got to go now.
Bye.
Good morning, sir.
May i help you?
Morning.
How you doing?
Aha.
An american.
West coast.
Am i right?
You're very good.
I'm fantastic with accent.
Yes, you are.
I'm a little confused.
I thought this was where to find the negaal kickboxing federation.
Do i have the right address?
May i see that?
Sure.
What is it that you need?
I have some business with mr.
Negaal.
Oh, well, maybe i can help you.
[Chuckle] all right.
Where can i find mr.
Negaal?
Oh.
Well, i'm afraid mr.
Negaal has just found you.
Heh!
And your plan is to take me to him, right?
Yeah.
I got a car waiting for us outside.
No thanks.
I think i'll find my own ride.
Oh, really?
Ooh!
Get him!
Outside!
He took off out the back.
Find him.
And when you do, hurt him!
[Grunting]
now i've got you.
[Shouting indistinctly] damn it!
Unh!
Aah!
Yah!
[Crunch]
[crunch]
[groaning]
ohh!
I thought you were on your way home.
So i took the scenic route.
Bollen: stand your ground, you pathetic wimps!
There's only two of them!
Bollen!
Croft.
Unh!
Get them!
Kill them!
[Grunting]
aah!
Unh!
Unh!
[Shouting]
[grunting] i can't... hey!
Hey!
Help me!
Help me!
Ohh.
[Siren] freeze!
Hands on the car.
Get your hands on the car.
Spread your feet.
Come on, now!
Are these the men?
Yes, sir.
They beat me up, and they robbed me.
Oh, he's lying.
He and his goons attacked me and my friend.
Are these the same men who robbed your shop?
Don't be afraid to tell the truth.
You shut up.
Well, not exactly.
Not exactly?
That's not what you told us.
There was a big fight, you see, and there was a lot of damage in my shop, and... are these the men who started the trouble or not?
Yes.
What?
Wait a second.
Come, let's go.
Take them in.
I don't believe this.
Thanks, sir.
You have a good day, now, huh?
You did well.
[Siren]
so what happens to us?
Are there charges?
A telephone call, maybe?
After your transfer.
Transfer?
Hey!
What transfer?
This jail is full.
Tomorrow morning, the most serious offenders will be taken to a mobile prison.
Prison?
And what do you mean, "serious offenders"?
I can't learn to mind my own business.
Hey, we didn't do anything, all right?
We were just defending ourselves.
I just spent 3 years behind bars.
I don't need this.
Don't worry.
We'll get out.
Ohh.
We just need a chance to tell our side of the story.
I should have taken the deal and murdered you when i had the chance.
Thank you, croft.
That's very nice of you.
Gentlemen, please.
In a small space like this, we have no choice but to get along.
I'm joseph mabuza.
So what are you in for, joseph?
A small misunderstanding with a customs inspector.
A few pounds of baby powder i purchased turned out to be, well, not exactly baby powder.
An innocent mistake but one with drastic consequences.
Joseph.
Here's that copy of "the hard times" that you wanted.
Thanks, peter.
I knew i could count on you.
Enjoy your book.
Bonded irish whiskey.
Mmm.
Nothing like it.
Can i offer you gentlemen a drink?
No thanks.
We're sitting ducks in here.
We've got to find a way out.
Then how do you plan to pay for the special service?
We'll owe you.
Hey.
Don't insult my intelligence.
Mabuza... you ever hear of a man named negaal?
Who in south africa hasn't?
He's a butcher, a madman.
His charm and intelligence make him more dangerous than a cobra.
Yeah, well... he wants to kill us.
Well, you're practically dead already.
Negaal knows we're here.
We'll be lucky if we live until morning.
And since you are in this cell with us... ohh.
I see.
I guess i'd better make the arrangements.
And i need to contact somebody on the outside.
Joseph: peter.
You don't like the book?
Message service, please.
This must be delivered immediately.
There's an extra charge for express services.
Fine.
Just do it.
[Grunting]
[whispering] are reeves and croft dead?
Not exactly.
Not exactly?
What does that mean?
Well, i have some good news.
They're as good as dead.
Nothing's as good as dead.
What are we gonna tell him?
Nothing.
They're in jail.
I've got someone on the inside.
[Man whistling]
i know that whistle.
It's busi.
That means there's gonna bra cocktail party.
Paul: it's one of negaal's men.
Hi, joseph.
Still awake?
You can't sleep?
It's a hot night.
Oh, well.
It's gonna get hotter.
[Screaming] [inmates shouting]
hey, shut up.
Shut up.
I said, shut up.
A waste of wonderful whiskey, but it was worth it.
At least you're safe from mr.
Negaal.
Yeah, for a couple hours.
[Footsteps]
wake him up.
Croft.
Well, joseph, i hope we didn't cause you too much trouble.
I have enemies in the mobile prison.
My transfer there would have been, shall we say, hazardous to my health.
Thanks, joseph.
Sure.
I wouldn't stay here too long if i were you, gentlemen.
Good luck, and godspeed.
[Siren]
[barking]
[men yelling]
come on!
Let's get them!
Come on!
We've got them!
[Shouting continues]
this way.
Look there!
There she is.
Come on.
[Revs engine]
go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go!
Hi, paul.
Heh!
It's been a while.
So who's your friend?
Just drive.
[Gunshot] beautiful animal.
[Ejects shell] gentlemen?
It wasn't our fault this time.
Stupid prison guard screwed up.
I assigned all 3 of you to croft and reeves, and now they're running around the country like they own it!
We'll get them next time, mr.
Negaal, sir.
I'll stake my life on it.
Do you have nothing more valuable, moon?
Mr. Bull told me how you mishandled the situation at the airport.
But croft was bollen's idea!
Don't blame me.
You should have killed reeves in the first place!
Someone has to pay for these absurd mistakes.
Boss.
Jeez.
But it was moon who messed up.
I need moon.
Bull was just muscle.
Think about that, mr.
Bollen.
Get this useless sack out of here.
[Snort]
you want to tell me where we're headed?
Home.
Why?
What's there?
Safety.
Pull over!
Please.
Haven't you figured it out yet?
I don't want safety.
I want negaal.
So do you, croft.
You want negaal as bad as i do, but you're afraid of him, of getting involved.
You think he's just gonna forget about you?
You screwed him over.
He'll hunt you down, and after he's killed you and your family, he'll find someone else to murder.
We have to stop him.
If we don't and another person dies, it's our fault.
What is going on?
Who is this guy?
God damn pain in the ass, that's who he is.
Matt, wait!
Wait!
Do you even know where you are?
You're in a foreign country.
You got no money.
We got the police after us with dogs.
You're in the middle of a god damn spinach patch.
You think you're gonna find negaal out here?
All right.
I'll help you, but you don't know negaal.
I do.
Let's go back to my home and get ourselves together.
Then we'll come up with a plan.
All right.
All right.
Angie, this is matt reeves.
He'll be staying with us for a couple of days.
Hi, angie.
Hi.
Are you negaal?
I understand you don't approve of my title.
The federation doesn't recognize you until you recognize the federation.
Well, i hardly think you have anything to say in the matter.
Well, perhaps you'd like to prove how good you are.
How good i am?
Against whom?
Oh, i don't know.
Me.
You?
Ha ha ha!
Heh heh heh.
Well, perhaps it might provide a minute or two of amusement and teach you some respect for your superiors.
Well, it's a lovely day out there.
Perhaps you'd like to give me this lesson on the lawn?
On the lawn?
Ha!
Ja.
Gut.
On the lawn.
Ohh!
Ha ha ha!
Huh?
You want to fight?
Huh?
Ha ha ha!
Huh?
You want some more?
Unh!
Ohh!
I concede.
You're a great fighter.
I acknowledge your superiority.
The opportunity for that was earlier.
A challenge to me is a challenge to the death.
What?
Are you insane?
Come.
Come.
Come!
You are joking.
Haah!
I represent the new, higher standard of world kickboxing.
You represent the old.
Bollen: hey, gents.
You must watch this.
The tiger claw.
It's good, it's good.
He'll crush his throat.
Ohh!
Good fight, boss.
Good fight!
Not too much lime this time, sir?
Better.
Gentlemen, good afternoon.
I'm going for a swim.
And, uh, please don't forget, my place tomorrow night.
We're celebrating the formation of our new empire, the negaal federation.
Champagne, gambling, entertainment.
It's all on me.
Well, gentlemen.
Ahem.
So much for art in the park.
Who knows what dinner will bring?
Shall we?
Ahem.
So how long have you two been together?
Since birth.
He's my brother.
You know, i really thought that you two were... look.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
What is going on?
And this time, i want an answer.
Do you know of a man named negaal?
I know he's the reason paul hasn't been home for the past 5 years.
Well, he murdered two of my friends, and the police can't touch him.
And just what are you gonna do about it?
Stop him... and carry out a promise i made to a friend.
And you're going with him?
I have to.
Dad would beery proud of you, paul.
Look.
I'm sorry, matt, but i love my brother, and i'm grateful he's home, but i can't let you pull him back into that world.
Angie, i'm not pulling him back.
It's his decision.
Our father died while his only son was in prison.
You know, maybe you need to have some faith.
Your brother is a good man.
Angie: you know you can't go up against negaal and bollen.
Bollen hates you for what you did to him.
They'll kill you if you get in their way.
Please, paul, just leave them alone.
I'm already in their way, angie.
Negaal's put the word out to have matt and me killed.
Paul, no.
This isn't just gonna go away.
For all the terrible things i've done in my life, now's the chance for me to redeem myself.
I've got to help him.
By going after negaal?
Yes.
[Sheep bleating]
good morning.
Morning.
Thanks.
Pleasure.
Angie, he will be back.
I know he'll be back.
I'm going with you.
Hyah!
Moon has secured the area, and there's tito with the investors.
This is a very important evening, bollen.
There are a lot of influential people here.
Don't worry, sir.
Everything's been arranged.
You better be right.
Ha ha ha!
Tito.
Welcome, gentlemen.welcome.
A couple of pictures.
Yes, sir, mr.
Negaal.
One for each of my guests.
Gentlemen, shall we?
Bollen: gonna have some fun tonight.
Let's go around the back.
All right.
Angie, i'm sorry.
You're gonna have to wait outside.
Paul, you said that i could... we need you out herewith the engine running.
If we're not back in half an hour, go home.
Matt, wait... angie, we'll be all right.
Yeah, right.
Gentlemen, a game of roulette.
Some chips for my guests.
Eagle eyes, buttie.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
How can we help you?
Ah, yes.
We're here for the party.
This is a private event.
Engraved invitations only.
Don't worry.
Mr. Negaal will be pleasantly surprised.
He's been looking all over town for us.
Thanks.
No invitation, no admission.
Besides, you're violating the dress code.
You have to wear a tux.
Oh.
Oh.
Dress code.
Dress code.
Beautiful animal.
Yeah.
Hey, sammy, george.
[Speaking native language] munjani.
[Speaks native language]
is that him?
The one and only.
And there's your old friend bollen.
I don't know about you, but i think i'll try my luck.
Excuse me.
May i use this?
Yes, sir.
Money plays.
Reeves is here.
What?
Negaal is gonna kill me.
I'll get the others.
Dealer: and zero wins.
Matt: oh, that's ok.
Let it ride.
Yes, sir.
Betting again, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Hey, bollen.
Oh, croft.
I've been waiting a long time for this, buttie.
Your head looks good.
Thought i ripped that ear off.
You know, somebody threw it back into the ring after you left.
I spent 3 years in prison because of you, bollen.
You set me up!
Yeah?
Well, you would have been helpful to the organization had you killed reeves.
Now you're both dead.
Ain't not exactly hurting yet.
What a shame, huh?
How's the pain, buttie?
Dealer: the gentleman wins again.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Well done.
Beginner's luck.
Can i, um, buy you a drink?
I'd love one, but it might not be such a good idea.
Why don't you let me worry about that?
Excuse me.
Who is this guy?
Good evening.
Why don't you pick a number, your favorite number?
35.
All right.
What about... all of it on 35?
Negaal: just who the hell are you?
Just another dude from the valley.
Of course.
You must be matt reeves.
You're not what i expected.
You're just a kid.
Well, you're exactly what i expected, a butt face.
Paul:
you're a dead man, bollen.
Get up!
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
Please don't.
Matt:
ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, please?
I would just like to take this moment to congratulate mr.
Negaal and his newly founded negaal kickboxing federation.
[Applause] the federation was formed because mr.
Negaal, a former kickboxer himself, was kicked out and banned from competition for using an illegal move and killing his opponent.
He now has his own organization... we need to get him out of here, tito.
Should they refuse, well, he kills them, too.
Two of my friends are dead because of this man.
At least they fought and died with dignity, which is more than most men do.
You're a gangster, a murderer, and a psychopath.
Anyone who's willing to be seen with you is dirt.
What you lack in intelligence you make up for in passion.
I like that.
Unfortunately, your friend johnny suffered the same dilemma.
To the house, tito.
I don't wish to be part of this undignified brawl.
If he's worthy of me, he'll come.
Hyah!
Again with spirit.
Hyah!
[Crack] aah!
Get him in close.
Come on.
Croft!
I'm going after negaal.
Call the cops.
I think it's time we found ourselves another job, huh?
Yeah.
Well, that party was a glittering success.
You can wave your empire good-bye.
Oh, really?
And why is that, tito.
Those international businessmen who were going to fund our worldwide expansion find your enthusiasm for martial arts a little... well, how shall i put it... dangerous.
I don't need them.
Do you think famous champions can disappear off the face of the earth and nobody will bloody notice?
It happens all the time.
Missing persons.
Oh, right.
Except they either got on a plane for south africa to join the negaal kickboxing federation or they received your letter on your letterhead inviting them to.
Enough!
We can discuss this some other time, tito.
Right now, i'm expecting someone.
[Footsteps] tito: oh, yes.
Someone worthy.
You killed my friends.
You're right.
I did.
What do you think?
My collection of championship belts.
Isn't that something?
You're never gonna kill or hurt anyone again.
Dying to fight, are we?
Our time, mr.
Reeves, has come!
Aah!
[Gasping] [coughing]
no, reeves.
Not the belts.
They're mine.
I earned them.
Never have them.
You can't have them.
My... my... [clattering]
angie:
the police are on their way.
Let's wait outside.
Suspicious car on the seafront Ostia.
We are going to stop it.
Do you have identity-card?
No.
Name?
Pelosi.
I said name, not surname.
Pino.
Pino is a nick-name.
Giuseppe.
When you talk to me, raise your head, Giuseppe Pelosi.
What happened to your head?
It hurts.
You've already seen a doctor;
but it was nothing.
Do you mean that you've hurt yourself?
Yes.
Good!
Include this in the statement because it is possible to say it was us.
Sergeant!
Look at this!
Pier Paolo Pasolini.
Do you know you've robbed someone famous?
I lost a ring, I think in the car.
What ring?
And the cigarettes and the car?
Not that!
That's enough!
You stay there.
Sorry, there has been a robbery and since we couldn't phone you, ...We had to come here.
Come in, please!
They stole a car Alfa Romeo GT 2000 K69996 Roma enrollment.
Yes, is that Pier Paolo.
And you are ...?
Her cousin.
Wait, I'm going to call.
Do not make noise, because his mother is sleeping.
Let me first untie it.
Where is the bag, Dad?
It's there.
- It's not!
"Look good, at the behind.
What a dirty and disgusting people!
You know where they come from!
They're all ...
My God!
My God!
Alfredo, come here!
I killed someone.
Who?
Pasolini.
Pasolini.
The famous one?
Where did they find it?
Where?
Out!
Out!
Clear The area!
Clear the area!
Whose is this ball?
Whose is this ball?
What are you waiting for?
Clear this area!
Get these people out of here!
It seems that they have used a plank out of this fence.
When I came here I saw that it was not a garbage, but a corpse.
Mr. Moravia, excuse, Your statement?
I am very confused.
My last name is spelled with two "t":
Salvitti.
What is you name?
I work for "La Stampa".
My name is Furio Colombo.
"La Stampa", the Agnellis newspaper!
- Yes, from Agnelli.
- Write that it is disgusting.
That it was a gang.
They have killed that poor wretch!
He has spent half an hour crying "Mama, Mama, Mama!"
They were about four or five.
Have you told the police?
Do I look like an idiot?
Is it you who has told police you lost a ring?
Yes, it is me.
Why?
Come with me!
We'll go to the judge.
- Why do I have to see the judge now?
- What kind of ring was it?
- Of gold, a fine stone.
And I had something engraved.
- What?
Something in English.
Only failed to tune in your signature.
Can I go?
Do you understand?
This was beside the body.
I should not be here.
I'm not a juvenile judge.
Do you know why you have been called?
Because if you are a minor and have been with other grownups...
- Which grownups?
-...
The case is not going to juvenile judge, but to an ordinary court.
Which means you will be judged by a court that will not have all the attention and understanding that they have with the children.
You'll be judged as an adult, as a true criminal.
Were you alone or were there others with you?
I was alone.
Then, Pasolini came to the Stazione Termini with Alfa.
First he spoke with your friends and then he called you, ... you were next to the kiosk corner of the Plaza Esedra.
How much money did he gave you for you to go with him?
He did not talked about money.
Just said he would give me a nice gift.
Just that.
A beautiful gift.
But when you came up to the car, he said what he wanted from you.
He asked only if I had eaten.
But you recognized him?
Did you know who he was?
It is not possible.
Such a famous man, in all the newspapers and television!
I never watch TV.
But there in the restaurant, as a customer ...was he not welcomed and was he not called by any name.
Paolo.
They called him Paolo.
We stopped outside of the plot of Idroscalo.
He wanted to get a blowjob but we failed to finish it.
Then I got off the car, to have a look.
I went to a fence and I saw him coming after me.
He began to caress and tried to get my pants.
With a crazy face and said:
"I kill you." "I'll kill you"
I fought back because we did not I agreed to have sex.
Then he got angry and tried to get a stick up in to my ass.
And he began to give me sticks, beatings, punches.
I could not take it anymore.
While we were rolling on the ground, I found a wooden And hit him in the head with all the strength I had:
... In the face, neck;
everywhere.
I stopped first when I saw that he did not move anymore.
I could not think of anything.
His face and hands were full of blood.
I got into the car and I left.
Everything went well.
The only thing I can say is that this case does not belong to me.
Today I will transfer all of it to the Juvenile Court.
- But Pelosi was alone?
- Was there no one else in the Idroscalo?
Eh!
Let's move!
I have already finished.
I will reveal them.
All right.
You, just undress!
No, throw it down.
We'll pick it later.
The truth is that after such a fight you didn't have dirty on you.
Almost nothing.
I stopped at a fountain to wash hands, shoes and clothing.
The fact is that water does not remove bloodstains.
Watch this!
Where there had to be a stain There is not a sign.
Come on, hurry!
Do I have to take off my socks?
Yes, even socks.
Tell me!
- Well?
- Are you Antonio Pelosi?
Yes, I am.
What do you want?
Have you received a call from the police tonight?
Yes, I have.
- Been told that your son Pino has been arrested?
-
Yes, I've been told.
A prisoner in the Prison for Minors.
Not an evil shall come upon him.
It is not the first time.
It is a misfortune to have a thief as a child.
- Your son is charged with murder.
The house where he lived Pier Paolo Pasolini is located in the EUR.
Inside, next to the old mother and Pasolini's cousin, ...is a young university-student and some friends.
Seems that the mother, Mrs. Susanna with whom the director was very close, ...and he played the role of the Virgin Mary in his film "The Gospel according to Matthew" she has been brave...
- Friends, we wouldn't have want to bring out this chronicle live broadcast.
This way personalities of culture and the world of cinema to pass away.
But what do they want from me?
It is not the right time.
Sorry!
Not yet.
Last night they were together in a restaurant?
In Pommidoro.
But Pier Paolo went alone, by himself.
Everyone went by himself.
Paolo to his home and I to mine.
You have worked a lot with Pasolini.
As one of his actors.
Give us a brief portrait of Who was Pier Paolo Pasolini.
He was a person who ... but see, I have no words!
A great, greatest person!
And above all, a person who was too good for the world.
Advocate!
Advocate!
Advocate, from Telediario!
Nino, finally!
Who are they?
I don't know.
Inspectors, police asked to see the documents of Pier Paolo.
They wanted to know if he had an appointment with someone last night.
- No, you can't do that.
-Nino, wait.
Speak softly.
Susanna is with Laura, who still knows nothing.
I disconnected the radio and TV.
I can not tell it to her.
What can we do to make her to authorize it?
If I sign this, I will not able to do anything.
We'll find a way.
But not now, not now.
Where?
She says nothing, does not ask anything.
It is as if she knew.
I can only say that Pier Paolo was uncomfortable in this society...
-...and so he has been removed.
- What else?
- I have a notes on Pelosi.
Natural Guidonia.
Height 1.71 m.
I would say he is quite athletic .
A nerd could not still have killed Pasolini.
Have you already found those graphics?
Damn!
Why did this idiot have to get killed precisely on Sunday?
Have you seen the interview with Davoli?
As he says, Pelosi has not been able to act alone.
And do we care about Ninetto Davoli!
Is he a judge or police?
...tears over the corpse, Aquiles and Patroclo, Niso and Euríalo.
Director!
- What is this?
- The hearing of Pelosi, word by word.
Congratulations!
Very good!
This is better than Ninetto who cries.
Youngster admitted killing Pasolini after a quarrel with the writer, ...who first, "said Pelosi," he hit his head with a stick,
The young man had arrived to Rome afternoon, he met some friends.
Do you have to hear!
-Shut up!
Let me hear!
Then a car came up to me Alfa Metallic, driven by a man...
At first, "he added I hardly recognized him.
And he himself confirmed to me that he was Pasolini.
But are you crazy?
Why did you say that you knew?
Have not you heard that he said that we also were on the station?
And if we are called to police station What shall we say?
The truth: that we were at the station!
What if they ask about the car?
Pelosi told that Pasolini escorted him to a restaurant,
The youngster said also that on the road to Ostia, they stopped at a gas station
Acar-driver,whowas there, confirmed this detail.
Is this story true about the driver?
He is called De Angelis and is working in a bar.
He says there was no one else besides Alfa.
Neither car nor bike.
Does that surprise you?
Pasolini wanted to have lowered on the seat with him.
The youngster have argued about the writer wanted to have sex with him, and he did't.
I asked the friends who were with Pelosi at the station and also the owner of the bar.
Perhaps they might have heard.
After you make a good raid by Piazza Cinquecento, something serious.
Some, under pressure, might speak out.
But what do you want do, Pigna?
We have terrorists here who make attacks.
The fascists who shoot, as the other day in San Lorenzo.
Robberies, kidnappings, drug trafficking, and you are concerned with that Pasolini.
This boy has a history.
He could have gotten into something very ugly.
Previously?
A stolen bike?
What the fuck is this investigation for if it has already confessed?
It is a history of homosexuals and nothing else!
But you see?
Television broadcasts only give the version of the accused, without any controlling.
Thus, fifty million Italians believe that everything happened as Pelosi said.
I understand that.
You're right, but ...
You must immediately send a statement on violation of sub judice.
-It's not the press, who is the judge.
- Advocate, please!
Such a statement would mean a threat to freedom of expression.
Notice that I can not do that.
You are one of the largest judicial authorities.
What I can do in this case is recommend maximum of discretion.
I guarantee that this episode will not be repeated.
You have my word.
- What happened to your arm?
- I broke it when I fell off my bike.
Wasn't that when you fought Pasolini the other night, in the Idroscalo?
No way!
Who says so!
I broke it a month ago.
Look, here I have the paper.
I haven't have anything to do with Pasolini.
- And how did you get to the Stazione Termini?
- By bus.
When Pasolini's car came Did you recognize him right away or not?
Sure!
Salvatore even grabbed his arm and asked for a role in his next film.
- And I said, "Look, I..."
- Did you tell Pelosi, who he was?
You bet!
When I saw him getting into the car, I said:
"Be careful, that Pasolini is capable of anything. "
Are you sure you said: "Pasolini"?
I think I did, more or less ...
That is strange!
Pino had said that he knew, right?
What do you know?
- It said so on TV.
- Television is wrong!
- How can it be?
- Is it Pelosi or you who is lying.
Maybe by a second thought, I didn't tell him when he came first in the car, but when he returned half an hour later.
- Why did he come back?
- Because I had to give the car keys.
What Car?
- Didn't you come by bus?
- I meant He wanted the keys to his house that I had, ... because his jacket did not have pockets.
- Then he said that he was going to Idroscalo.
- No, he didn't say anything.
And then what happened?
Nothing.
He went away.
But this time Pasolini did not return.
Do you think that if he killed someone, he would take the car from the dead and he would go around 160 kms.
per hour like an idiot?
Who told it went that fast?
They have only said that they arrested him, don't make things up.
With a car like that, and not going to run away?
I don't think, that he has killed anyone.
You must be aware that this Pino "frog" is not capable to do that.
I say he only stole the car and that's it.
It was someone else who killed him.
- Unless they were drugged.
- Drugged with what?
With anything.
Ask Braciola, who understand these things.
Which could mean they both work as a pharmacist.
Go to hell!
And what do you think?
What happened between Pelosi and Pasolini?
What happened, happened and me, I don't care.
Good morning!
I am a journalist.
I would like to talk to the person who is called:
Ennio Salvitti.
- What Salvitti, the fisherman?
- Where can I find him?
The fisherman's gone!
This morning, at least four of you has come.
He has denied everything.
He didn't tell anything to your colleague.
See the article is signed Giulio Colombo.
It was invented!
They only failed to write that we helped that poor Pelosi.
Poor?
He killed him.
I would give a rose to that poor kid.
Do you know what Pasolini wanted from that boy?
Would you like it to be happen to your son or your brother?
He must have got it hot.
Go now, go away!
Why did he have to die here?
Couldn't he die somewhere else?
Leave Now Go!
A little to the right
I was close to Pier Paolo when he was very young.
He introduced me to poetry and film.
I was his assistants in their first movie, "Accattone".
And I think that this is not a crime that is against a person or against a brother, ...but a crime against culture, intelligence and poetry.
I don't know who his murderers were, and neither I know what they did, ...but anyway, they Pier Paolo have kept talking.
Now they have shut his mouth forever.
And around this, you can capture something horrible and monstrous.
Pass the Press Office.
It was a decision to silence him forever.
And that deeply impressed us.
InmycapacityasSecretaryofthe group Social House ...consider it my duty to denounce aberrant space, ...that the newscast has been dedicated to turbid Pier Paolo Pasolini's murder. (Dot)
It is scandalous to say that her murder is a crime against culture. (Upper)
We, and with us certainly millions of Italians, do not feel represented by the culture of Pier Paolo Pasolini.
Immaturity, immaturity argue.
You should not worry.
And will be nothing.
It was in self defense.
What would you do you, if you are the attacked?
It remains now that the judges protect queers!
Quiet!
Between the immaturity and self- defense, will leave in a few months.
But if you start to talk, you'll out, but with the feet first.
Is it true that you are the defendor of that Pelosi?
Why?
What do you know about that?
Nothing, apart from frequent the same environment.
He ended pretty badly, poor Pier Paolo.
Why?
Did you know Pasolini?
How would I not have known?
Of view, of course, not personally.
Always hanging around with the same car.
And dear, when you get old ...
Whether you are famous or not, time happens to everyone.
And that night I saw him in his car going round and round.
Then I met a friend and I didn't pay attention.
Did you see Pelosi, there at Stazione?
Maybe, I remember ...
A handsome guy!
But he did not kill Pasolini.
Everyone knows that.
So...
So who killed him were those who has the control there.
They are like beasts.
For some time they had sworn to Pasolini.
- Why?
- He was asking too many questions and was always about the balls.
He had been warned twice already.
How many?
A car followed him for an ambush.
Would you tell all this to the judge?
Listen for a moment!
We protest strongly because we have the right to see Pelosi.
- We have been appointed regularly.
- Sorry, dear Vincenzo.
- He is Vincenzo, I am Tommaso!
- Please forgive me.
I meant Tommaso.
In any case, no one can see or talk with your client now.
Perone, but why not?
I prefer that no-one speaks with him before I have questioned him.
Hello!
- Have you heard what the lawyers say about Pelosi?
- No, what?
They say his confession is unconvincing and that he will be aligned with the civil, represented by Marazzita.
"That Saturday night, must Giuseppe Pelosi have others. "
You see, it is strange!
Obviously they think that he is covering somebody.
Perhaps out of fear.
If I had to defend myself and I was convinced that there were other perpetrators ...do the same.
Show that he was just a simple accessory.
So, why does Pelosi insist that he was alone?
Because it aspires to that legitim is declared mainly defense and, for being minor.
He knows that if the judge considers minor age, the case will end quickly.
- Have you studied law, Perosi?
- No, it is simple experience.
The past year he has gotten rid of a charge of robbery, only to be minor.
Anyway, as I understand Pier Paolo have jumped on the fascists.
I'm not mean physically, but fascism and the air around us and the horror we breathe every day.
Or, perhaps, it have been themselves, even physically.
Listen!
I have no intention to a political process.
- No?
- No.
- Why?
- Because it is a political process
You'll see!
The first has a history of carrying weapons and so forth.
The second is a beginner, but the other day he attacked a passerby.
This, attempted murder and robbery.
Released after a time.
And this is the worst.
Me.
They are all junkies.
People with cold turkey are able to kill their own parents to steal a watch.
Yes, everything is fine.
But What to do with Pelosi?
Two of them have been seen in the bar Pelosi usually goes.
Well?
What do they have to do with Pasolini ?
What do they have to do with Pasolini?
Haven't you seen the pamflets they distribute?
Take!
I kept one as a souvenir.
Cute, right?
Remember what I said.
I do not want to call a guard.
I thought they were the lawyers.
What lawyers!
Did you hear what they are saying?
They say that maybe you were not alone.
You know that if you were not alone, if there was someone else they will give you a life sentence?
Never
You have not slept, right?
How am I going to sleep!
Watch out!
You're hurting me.
Like those two.
You must change lawyers.
Yes, indeed.
He agreed to carry Pelosi's defense and I haven't wasted your time.
What is this?
Books by Pasolini.
I read, to learn.
First, because it is not my usual habit to demonize anyone.
And secondly, because maybe these books contain the mystery of his disease.
An erotic paranoia, which, that night at the Idroscalo, led to tragedy.
Strange things happen these days.
The communists, who want equality ...asking for special treatment for obscenity Pasolini, only because he was an accomplished artist.
That's easy!
The poor Pelosi struck to defend.
To defend his honor.
An absolute tragic gesture, course.
But this gesture of despair holds symbolic revolt of the proletariat, ...who rebels against exploitation a pseudo-libertarian culture.
It is very comfortable, gentlemen, to go hunting by driving an Alfa Romeo GT 2000!
This process will basically make clearance for cultural terrorism and who Pier Paolo Pasolini truly was.
May his soul rest in peace!
Come on, pull the car of Pasolini Quick!
Come quick!
Look what you do!
You have to make the autopsy.
It's too important and I do not trust anyone else.
Sorry, Nino, but you can't ask me to do that.
Yes, because you're the only one that can help.
Court Administration experts have been unable examine the body at the crime scene.
They could only see it in the Morgue.
The Judge has not yet questioned Pelosi's friends ...local residents, or the regular users of the station.
They have not even made at least one Car expert analysis of Pier Paolo's vehicle.
You know that in a process for children, the instructor has only 40 days.
- We have nothing!
- What you waiting from me?
I can not do miracles.
Tomorrow, at the funeral, it will be buried for ever:
...body, investigation and attention of the public opinion and the words of Pelosi will stay as the only truth.
And according to you, what is the truth?
So far I have some impressions based only at the first hearing of the boy.
The impressions also count.
Do you think Pelosi is telling the truth or not?
No!
I don't think so.
It seems too good to have been happened exactly like this.
- How do you see it?
- I'm learning.
- We will not publish any of this.
- Why?
Too violent and tragic.
No-one would not believe that the idiot Pelosi made it by himself.
Anyway it is better that we keep us ahead of our competitors.
Okay, let's begin.
Two large skin abrasions at the front and side.
Bruising on the cheekbone and left jaw.
Jaw fracture two points.
Transverse lesion outer ear, left atrium.
Right ear injury with the ear nearly torn off.
Some finger-edge fractures left hand and a deep cut on thumb.
Fracture of the sixth and seventh right rib.
On the left side, fracture the sixth, seventh, eighth and the ninth rib.
In summary, ten fractures all together.
Capsular wounds are discovered in the liver.
Was this all figured in the Report to the Court expert?
I don't think they had read it.
We've lost first and foremost a poet...
and in the world there are not so many poets.
born only three or four every century.
the end of this century, is Pasolini among the very few poets remembered.
The poet should be something sacred.
The cause of death was fracture in the heart caused by the push of a car.
We are done, Paolo.
"Dear Pelosino I received your mail.
I've been to Inacasa, but Johnny was not there.
"As soon as I see him, I'll tell him to write to you".
Who is this Johnny?
Is he that friend of yours:
Johnny, the Gypsy?
What do you care is it important?
"Now you're in jail, do not give up and think about what you've done.
You have to pretend that nothing happened.
"Just think one day you will be free and that day is near.
"Goodbye.
Your friend, Braciola".
Who the hell is Braciola?
The son of Jack the Ripper?
This comes from Germany.
Do you know anyone there?
There are four poor fellows who migrated there ten years ago.
Have taken up a collection.
With all these fans we are going to get much money.
There is another version of the death of Pasolini.
They killed two motorcyclists
What story is that from mysterious witness?
Who has told Fallaci there were other perpetrators?
Is it possible that you don't know anything?
Even in a newspaper article do we appear like idiots!
How is it possible?
What have we done so far?
Where are the expert reports of Pasolini's car?
Where are the interviews of those in the Idroscalo?
Why hasn't it been made a raid in the bar of the Station?
They had to be here!
We know them one by one!
Can you tell me why you haven't done anything ?
How come were on the street at this hour?
Didn't you have rheumatism?
- What about you?
- Yes, of course.
I was there by chance;
looking for a pharmacy.
- Did you know Pasolini?
- Who doesn't?
He was a great director.
No...
I mean, had you seen him before?
Sure, on TV and the movies!
I mean if you saw him there at the Stazione Termini, where you were.
Listen:
I told you I I was looking for a pharmacy.
Stop being a fool, idiot!
You had already seen him at the Station?
Perhaps one of those times that you were looking for pharmacy!
No.
I never saw him there.
Good morning.
We are of the Mobile Brigade police.
Do you live here?
Yes.
- Have you been questioned?
- No, nobody has been here.
The worst job always comes to us, eh, Professor?
Pigna!
There is amount of tracks here where the car was.
Why wasn't the place sealed?
As soon as I arrived, I sealed it.
But I was not the first to arrive.
But how to do the research?
How can we distinguish the tracks?
Look here!
And here!
And here!
And here!
It looks like an act of lunatics!
Are you trying to cover up for someone?
I'll pretend I did not hear that.
Goodbye, professor!
Again?
I have already told the story twenty times.
I'm sick of it!
- How did you come to the Stazione?
- In my car, a 850.
Not true.
Your friends have said that night you went to the Stazione by bus.
So who are you?
I'm only going to answer the judge.
I'm the attorney for the family of Pasolini.
You're going to have to answer my questions.
- Is it true?
- It's true!
Maybe my friends, as I don't have the card, have thought it was a stolen car.
However, my colleague, the 850 was acquired correctly.
- Here's the bill for the acquisition.
- Sure!
It took a lot of money.
Where did the money go?
That's my business.
I'm here to talk about Pasolini, not my car.
Let's go on!
You didn't realize that he was injured by the surface of the car?
You did not even think that he could have been alive?
So why did you say to your cell-partner that you had killed Pasolini?
I said Pasolini, because when the police stopped me, I was told that the car was his.
No, I did not asked that.
I asked: why did you say: "I've killed?
Because I thought that after that beating and blood and time that had happened ...
Then you know you gave such a beating that he could already be dead!
I don't know!
I don't know!
What kind of way is that against the defendant?
- Are we in the KGB?
- Come on, calm lawyer!
Then, I will return to you and formulate the question
When you left the place, what did you think?
I thought only of escape.
I did not think of Pasolini, if he was alive or dead only escape.
I wanted to escape and nothing else.
- When did the letter from Braciole arrive?
- Sunday.
- Can you make a copy here?
- Yes, down in the office.
I have never supported homosexuals.
They are worse than others.
in this world those who treat us badly we also treat them badly.
Homosexuals, thieves and murderers are unnecessary.
Pasolini, only because he was someone to write wise, it felt important.
and we and the media are still giving him much importance.
Yesterday I saw the funeral of Pasolini on television.
There were many people, like the President of the Republic.
I say it's not fair.
The State should punish criminals, thieves...
Then, why to honor the homosensuals?
Homosexuals!
Sit!
- Do you agree?
- Sure, he asked for it!
He could have stayed in the North and not come to Rome to molest young people.
- He liked sissies.
- No, the hard ones!
This is one of his poem on Rome.
Listen!
"City great and miserable
"... who showed me how happy men and the wild are teaching children.
"Those little things, in which reveals the greatness of life.
"I walk fast and secure by the crowded streets ...
"...and go to another man without making a tremble!
"Not be ashamed to see how with the fingers counting his money ...
"...the worker is sweaty
"...with his weathered face has the color of a perpetual summer.
"City great and miserable
"...you made me to discover a life unknown to me,
"...until I discovered that each person was a world. "
This was Pasolini and this was what I thought you.
Braciola, Calabrone and Johnny, all friends of Pelosi.
Keep an eye on them, who they are and what they do.
I know Braciola.
He is related to Monarchist Union.
Johnny calls him "the gypsy" and his parents own a carousel.
He left Marmo Jail recently.
Small things: stealing a bike.
Was he in jail at the day of the homicide?
No, he was out.
Why do you want to know?
Forget it.
Sit!
Sit!
Well, ...what is so important?
Within ten minutes I have a meeting.
What about the report?
For months I have had my eye on that bar.
The roman bums use to gather there.
But earlier this year, when the kidnappings and assaults began, ...it was the french that begun to appear:
Marseille.
Here is one of the important ones.
He is called Gilles Marcel.
His two main vices are dressed as women and they sell drugs.
Inside this bag is a kilo of heroin.
We arrested them an hour ago ....
The Nacional Vanguard is: a Black Terrorist, suspected for bombing.
Continue!
National Vanguard and New Order which is the same as saying that the fascists are using bombs, have joined and now call themselves "Popular Struggle."
They are financed by kidnapping, robbery and drug trafficking.
And the evidence?
Where are they?
This one here called Luigi Mariano, a banker in Brindisi was kidnapped several months ago.
Who is behind all of this is Concutelli, military commander of the Black Terrorists.
The conclusion is that Rome is like Chicago, right?
No.
The conclusion is that the fascists and the underworld are allied.
And now they do the assaults, kidnappings and drug trafficking together.
Shortly, if the fascists were before recruiting people for beating;
...they are asking now another thing:
to kill, make bombs and worse ...like murdering Pasolini.
I do not make silly faces, just because you have fixed ideas about the fascists and and all that crap without any evidence, you have nothing.
Is this a report?
So you work here?
It seems that one is reading "L'Unita".
That is to leftish.
Now, draw a picture of yourself.
Did you forget your hands.
Didn't they teach you to draw on the College?
Sorry, wait a minute.
Let him at least finish.
What did you mean when you said?
That he is a savage, a beast?
That everybody already knows.
He is a monster, right?
And you, how do you judge your child's behavior?
And how should I?
Don't you understand you have to survive?
- You mean that Pino did well doing that?
- Whoever did wrong was Pasolini.
He should have stayed writing poetry.
Because I stay in my house, when I return at night, dead tired.
To me these things things have never happened.
- What do you think of what he says about your father?
- What do I have to think about?
Does it seem normal what you have done?
Well, I do not know!
In short, of everything that happened, is there anything you wish wouldn't have happened?
- Yes, of course!
- What?
The newspapers indicate to them, but they had nothing to do with it.
- It is not their fault that I'm what I am.
- Like what?
Now you understand me.
- Is there anything else that you dislike?
- They me call "frog".
I've got this nickname in the newspapers.
Do I have a frog face?
There are guys who have seen me on TV and they say that they dream with me, not a frog.
Death.
Say it with another word.
To finish everything.
What about birth?
I can not think of anything.
- Well?
- Still I have to work harder.
Work, Luigi?
The truth is that I would have preferred see you tomorrow ..
Why tomorrow?
We have no time to lose.
Give me this.
Listen, Nino.
Sorry to give bad news but I think, his conscience, is immature.
- What? "Immature?
- Immature!
What do you mean, if he have killed a man?
Even a five year old child knows that taking someone's life is something that ...
Yes, I know.
But he ... no ...
doesn't even know that ...
He has no moral.
Conditions where he has lived so far ...
Stop with the psychology!
For you even Cain would be innocent!
You realize that if the Court will judge him as immature, he will be free the next day.
Yes, I know.
If you want, you can always avoid the file form an expert report.
Of course I wouldn't submit it.
Andreotti, Fanfani, Rumor and at least one dozen other powerful Democrats should be taken to the bench of the prisoners.
And being processed by a particular number of crimes:
agreements with oil, industrial and bankers, ...collaboration with the CIA, illegal use of secret information, ...responsibility in the massacres of (not to punish the perpetrators) ...Milán, Brescia and Bologna by landscape destruction and urban Italy,
...for their role in the anthropological degradation of the italians, ...and by the wild explosion of mass-culture and media ...and for their role in the stupidity of the Television criminality.
Without a criminal proceeding they are futile to expect you can do anything in our country.
And it seems clear that the respectability of Some Democrats (Moro, Zaccagnini) or the morals of the Communists has been good for nothing.
August 28, 1975 Pier Paolo Pasolini
Pasolini wanted to prosecute all.
And you know why?
Because he wanted revenge on all criminal proceedings initiated against him.
Pasolini!
How persecuted he was?
What kind of a victim or a monster built by Press!
Where, people, are the facts.
October 15, 1949, signed for the first time Casarsa Police corruption of minors.
January 1, 1951, Chioggia:
arrested for drunkenness.
July 21, 1955: processing by Judicial Council of Milan ...for pornographical contents in his book "Young Life".
- Doctor, your toga.
- All right, put it in bed and try not to wrinkle.
Today we'll have all of the TV-stations and must should look good.
You can go, Gara!
February 9, 1960: arrested for the sad facts of Via di Panico.
July 16, 1960, Anzio: report for corruption of minors.
November 18, 1961: report for assault with a deadly weapon.
More than 30 processes has the man had man and he's always come out innocent!
Everything is gone in smoke.
But, gentlemen, where there's smoke there's fire.
1976 and on the 2d of February, ...The Juvenile Court compound of the Gentlemen
Dr. Alfredo Carlo Moro, President, Dr. Giuseppe Psalm, Judge
Dr. Matteo Guarino, court fees, Dr. Maria Grazia Milone, Honorary Judge.
With intervention of the Public Ministry, represented by the prosecutor, Dr. Giuseppe Santarsiero and with the assistance of the Subscribed Chancellor, Dr. Roberto Carnevali, meets the Board of Hearing, to discuss the criminal case
...of the preliminary investigation against Giuseppe Pelosi, accused in the proceedings.
The defendant is assisted by Attorney Rocco Mangia.
The civil court, Susanna Pasolini, has already been established and represented by their lawyers, Antonio Marazzita and Guido Calvi.
Being a minor, the case will take place behind closed doors.
I confirm everything I said and I have nothing to add.
Better it couldn't been said.
...but I'd like to make some questions.
Ah, yes!
Sorry, president, could ...
The defendant requests that his mother leaves the room during questioning.
The Court accepts this request.
Please, ma'am.
The will call you, as soon as possible.
When you went to Piazza, to the kiosk, did you know that there were men, who...?
Yes, I knew.
And that night, were you prepared to leave with any of these men?
Yes.
- Have you had done it before?
- No, never.
That night would be the last one.
It was because of necessity.
Heavy needs, I guess.
I wanted to pay the car: a 850.
Did you have another reason to explain your behavior?
Some want to do as women;
but I wanted to do as a male.
I wanted to see if doing so with a Man, would disgust me.
And that reaction came when you were asked for oral sex?
- I resisted a little.
- But this is absurd!
Then why did you accept to leave with a man, in a place like the Idroscalo?
And why do you say so now and not in previous hearings?
Mr President, that's not possible!
He is trying to intimidate the defendant.
Attorney Mangia, I assure you, if that happens I wouldn't allow it.
Please sit down!
Do you understand the question?
Why do you say now that you offered resistance?
What's wrong if I I agree first now?
After what I did, as I said in my statement, I thought it was over.
Climbed into his car, only to see what it was.
He also came up and started to touch me
I told him to stop because I did not want to a woman.
He had a wood in his hand and wanted to use it with me.
I said to him: "Are you crazy?"
Then he started to beat me with that stick.
I kicked him and tried to escape.
He ran after me and jumped on me.
He kept on beating with the bat, until I got it and started beating him.
But then the stick broke.
Then I grabbed a wooden beam and I gave him in the head with all my strength.
I was in shock, with face and hands covered with blood.
I could not see anything.
So I got in the car and ran away.
If you were together at a restaurant You must have spoken, right?
- He was speaking.
- About what?
What do I know?
If he worked, where he lived;
which school he was gone and things like that.
- Was it nice?
- Yes, it was.
It was nice at that time.
But later, when you left, when you came the Idroscalo, what's happened?
In your previous interviews, you said that he seemed to have crazy eyes.
How is it possible?
- I repeat the question.
- I understood the question.
So what?
- Have you heard?
You know what they've done these idiots?
- If I know what?
After the meeting the other day, have raid the bar where I was researching.
And, of course, have arrested ten people who had nothing to do with it.
They spoiled six months of my job!
Yes, because ...
Because they're idiots and knuckleheads.
Now, who finds the fascists and those from Marseille?
Quiet!
They cleared the case to me.
I have been transferred.
We call this promotion!
I'm sorry, because I had achieved a picture of Braciola, the friend of Pelosi.
It is this that is stated here.
But you'll have to find it yourself.
It could be a good clue.
Why do you do that?
I do not handle the case either.
I too have been "upgraded".
Why haven't you told all of this?
This is only a hypothesis.
Perhaps, but because no one would have said it, it had to be me.
Do you think that perhaps some training of extreme right, linked to the bad life, would have...?
Dear lawyer, I do not believe anything!
I have given the information there is.
You are the one who has to think.
Are you saying that they have hindered the research?
I have to go.
Goodbye, lawyer.
Good luck.
No, Pier Paolo never removed the glasses.
Not even at home, not for a moment.
It is necessary to exclude that he had left his car without wearing them.
Do you recognize this jersey and these templates?
No, the jersey is not Pier Paolos.
I don't know to whom it belongs.
Could not they have been in the car for a longer time?
I washed the car the day before.
That same afternoon, Pier Paolo came back.
I'm sure that they were not there.
- Maybe they were in the trunk.
- Absolutely not.
I also cleaned the trunk and there was no jersey or a template.
But do they belong to the boy?
No, not to him.
We've checked.
I did not want to kill him.
It was he who has forced me to.
I did not want to kill him!
It was an accident.
Silence!
Do you recall where you found exactly this jersey?
In the back seat I think.
But the investigating experts say they found in the trunk.
It is possible that during the analysis, someone has moved it.
Please try to be as accurate as possible.
Does it change much if the thing was in the trunk or back seat.
In the trunk, it could be a simple cloth.
But in the back seat, since it belonged not to the victim or to the accused, we would think that in the car there was a third person.
- It was in the back seat.
- Thanks.
You can go.
- Who are you:
Pugliese?
- And you, who are you?
- We had an appointment.
- I don't think so.
Didn't you have an appointment with Braciole?
- Is it you?
- Sure!
And he is my brother, Bracioletta.
- Go to hell!
- No, You go to hell!
What's all this?
I said that I have a job to be done and I need two dudes.
And they sent two amateurs!
- Amateur you!
Do you understand?
- Do not worry.
- Listen, let's leave it.
- Wait!
Don't hurry.
How much money are we talking?
Ten grand a head for both partners.
But it only serves me if you can work with this.
Do I hear the fear?
Good afternoon!
You can come back when you are a little older.
But who do you think you are talking to?
You are before the ones who killed Pasolini!
What do you mean?
If you ask me to kill someone like Pasolini, you need a motherfucker
- And who would call you two?
- And why the fuck do you care?
What the hell do I care?
What are you doing, dammit!
Hey, low down the gun!
I knew he was a spy.
Clearly it was a cop!
Signed "Braciola".
Was it you who wrote this?
Why?
Is it forbidden to write to a friend in jail?
- So you know Pelosi well.
- So what?
Here you talk about a mutual friend a certain Johnny, the gipsy.
So what?
He killed a to steal a watch.
He himself has confessed.
Johnny is not bad.
It's just that that night he was a little stoned.
Perhaps it was too high when he lent a hand to Pelosi.
- I told you that everything is a lie!
So why did you say to the police, that you killed Pasolini at Idroscalo that night?
I do not know, because.
What do you mean "because?"
I did nothing, only said for, well, to feel important.
And now why did you retract everything?
Mom, go away from here.
I do not want you go out in the newspapers.
Take a photo of me.
I am more handsome than Pino "frog"!
There is nothing so far that differs even slightly from the version given by Pino Pelosi.
Neither version of the three friends who were with the Stazione, only that they lied about coming to the site with the car just because they thought it was a stolen car.
Or media revelations that only created confusion.
Neither this latest farce of the two brothers have criminalised themselves just to be important to their fellow adventurers.
May I ask, Mr. President, Can we now go to what really matters?
Let us establish this for once and for all whether or not it was a homicide.
Let's point to see if Pelosi is immature Or we'll continue wasting our time?
Indeed, Mr. President, in this purpose, ...here is the psychiatric report of the civil court.
I ask the Court who consists in act.
Secondly our expert, Pelosi must be regarded as immature.
I know.
We could have stopped to let this report out.
But, look, Mr. President, we believe that the greatest lesson of Pier Paolo was his passionate love and unbiased for the truth, whatever.
We would be unfaithful to her memory, if we settled otherwise.
We disagree with evaluating our expert but we are ashamed if we not submit that report.
The Alfa Romeo 2000 GT was standing here next to the football field fence.
This is the area of the altercation.
A wide area, As you can see.
At this point, about 70 meters away, the body was found.
But it was here, next to the car where The first attack took place.
And it was here where his shirt was found.
In this first phase, is Pasolini violently beaten on the head and the wounds begin to bleed abundantly.
Indisputable proof that ...gives us a lot of blood found on the shirt.
Look at this: it is not torn anywhere.
We can deduce that Pasolini himself took it off during a break in the attack, ...likely to clog blood from wounds.
But what could cause a blood-loss of this magnitude?
If we stick to what Pelosi self said, this plank, ...which is written:
Buttinelli, ...indicating the name of the owner of this house ...exactly at the point in which the body was found.
Moreover, Pelosi has himself admitted that this plank comes into play only in the end of aggression.
The only other heavy object He admits to having used it before... is this.
As can be seen well: a fragile stick ...that after the first strike should have been destroyed, as it happened.
But how a stick of this size can cause such serious injury?
It is impossible!
Therefore, even accepting the explanation Pelosi, it is logical at this first phase, the presence of other heavy blows and other aggressors.
The type of wounds found on Pasolini's head, ...as everyone knows, is an area largely supplied by the capillaries, ...usually give rise to hemorrhage called capillary ...in which blood gushes violently outwards ...every time the heart the pumps.
So at the end of what Pelosi's own words was called man-to-man-fight ...Pasolini's body was completely covered with blood and mud.
Pino Pelosi, however, the time of his arrest had a spot of blood, proved to be Pasolinis ...in his left fist on his wool sweater.
He also had a spot of his own blood on the edge of his shirt... and some blood stains of Pasolini in the right leg of his pants.
- Nothing else.
- But if I had a cut here!
Yes, indeed, ...the boy had a small head injury, but attention that lesion was a clean cut ...without causing abrasion or bruising.
A wound that I would not say it was produced by a stick or wooden board.
- And then?
- It's easy!
Persecuted by the police-car, Pelosi was forced to stop sharply.
At impact, he hit his head against the hood, ...that indeed was found stained with his blood.
- But what are you saying?
- Silence!
The accused is not allowed to intervene.
You may only speak when asked.
Go on, professor!
Pelosi's version seems therefore unlikely.
How is it possible to leave Pasolini in that state, with plain rotted wood?
How is it possible that after this dramatic man-to-man-fight, as he has described he was not covered in blood and mud?
I went to wash at the source!
If it had gone like this, at the time of detention he would have been soaked, ...which does not appear in the verbal report of the police.
This is outrage!
It was like I said.
We have already heard your statement.
If you insist interrupting, you will be forced to leave the room.
I apologize, Mr. Chairman, it will not recur.
As stated so far it seems possible for us to outline, ...at this point, a reconstruction of the facts.
Shortly after midnight,
Pier Paolo Pasolini and Pino Pelosi Idroscalo arrive by car.
The car stops at the port of the football field.
They start talking.
The writer takes off his glasses and leaves them on the dashboard of the car, ...which will then be found.
Pelosi also places there a pack of cigarettes and lighter.
But these, inexplicably, will not be found.
And it is when they incomplete oral sex.
Later, Pelosi affirms to have left the car and have been followed by the writer;
...well, "just to have a look."
To see what?
The darkness is total.
And Pasolini remains without going to put on the glasses?
Which, according to his cousin Graziella Chiarcossi, says ...he never took off.
Everything indicates that the writer did not leave the car by his own choice, ...but was thrown by force and with extreme violence.
Pasolini is wounded and bleeding heavily.
But he is still alive and yet in a position to remove the sleeve to buffer their wounds.
If they wanted to give him just a lesson That would have enough.
But this was only the beginning of a massacre.
I found, at autopsy, Pasolini received a violent trauma of bruised testicles.
Well, if that trauma had occurred in the first phase, as Pelosi claimed ...it would have prevented Pasolini of any reaction.
Not allowing him therefore to get up, take off his shirt and walk about 70 meters.
I ask you now to put your attention on this photo.
My colleagues who did the autopsy didn't even had in consideration this photo.
I leave to others the valuation of the reasons for this incredible behavior.
I can only say ...that this bias of the expert report has led my colleagues to believe acceptable... that Pelosi didn't realize what happened the body of Pasolini with the car.
If we instead had studied this photo ...they would have realized that Pelosi's statement not respond to the truth, in any way.
Look carefully at this.
These are self-evident marks of the left tire ...clearly show what happened to the poet's body.
And for the avoidance of doubt, I asked an analysis of the tire.
As you can see ...they match.
Therefore,...it was not as the car ran over Pasolini.
It didn't follow this track, ...it could even have been accidental.
Instead it continued.
And what necessity did the car have to make this absurd curve ...if not because the driver wanted voluntarily crush the body?
I do not know if that was the will of Pino Pelosi.
I do not know if he was driving the car at the time of the collision, ...but the murder was consummated definitely.
Certainly Pelosi was there and his participation is certain somehow.
He says he had to stop at a fountain to wash their hands stained with blood.
Why then the steering wheel of the car has not been fouled?
He said that the blood spots of Pasolini found on the hood of the car were left by his bloody hands.
But perhaps he forgot that the spots were found in the passenger side and not the drivers.
Only two scenarios are possible.
Either Pelosi's hands were stained of Blood and raised up on the passengers side while someone else was driving.
Or his accomplice, with bloody hands sat in the passenger seat ...while Pelosi, whose hands were not bloodied, sat on the driver's seat.
In either case ...it seems clear that, along with Pelosi, someone else got in to the car, ...that he had participated in aggression.
- Not true!
Not true!
- My son!
- Quiet or you'll leave the court!
I maintain that a thorough examination of all the tests:
...the club, table, clothes of Pasolini and injuries, ...on the one hand invalidate Pelosi's story, on the dynamics of everything what happened.
On the other hand we have to portray the basis for the hypothesis that Pasolini was the victim of aggression of several people.
It's a conspiracy!
A conspiracy!
They have invented everything!
Everything!
This is outrageous!
A farce!
I'll never know how to thank all for what you have done and you're going to continue doing so.
But, since it lacks, ...I do not know how to explain,
...I feel much less strong and much less intelligent.
It also happen to us.
We all have lost something priceless.
Indeed, Guido:
something incalculable.
What it the process requests of the civil trial?
They calculated the damages.
And how much value was the life of Pier Paolo?
What do you do, Graziella?
I do not want anything from Pelosi.
I feel like this.
- Because Pier Paolo would have been horrified.
- We can ask for a lira.
A symbolic thing, allowing us to continue the process.
Graziella is right.
We have given the Court all the evidence that were needed
And now it makes no sense to ask a compensation, not even a symbolic one.
Do not ask anything, or we'll have to explain our decision.
- This is important!
- But it is a huge risk.
If we retreat now, we can not be present in the successive phases of trial.
Nor can we turn, in the case of an unjust sentence.
Wait a minute!
Yes, sure.
We will not participate any longer, nor be able to make our voice heard.
But it's a risk we must take.
Be the voice of Pier Paolo:
...his books, his ideas.
Try to do what he had done.
Is this what you meant?
We want Pelosi convicted.
But the penalty he will get will be somewhat insignificant and impossible to evaluate ...because Pelosi is someone who is subjected to this process and to this Court.
While Pasolinis memory belongs to all of us, because it belongs to another reality.
With these words, Mr. President, The family of Pasolini informs ...intends to withdraw its participation of the civil court and doesn't ask any compensation.
In our view, voluntariness of the murder and the plurality of the executing have been widely demonstrated.
But we can not, ...from the moment we decide to abandon this process,
...but to remember what we all lost the night of November 2, 1975.
That night, in which the heart of Pier Paolo Pasolini stopped beating;
...his eyes to reveal and his conscience to judge.
Do you have fire?
Pasolini has been defined many times as a provocateur.
Perhaps because in recent times he had intensified progressively his interventions, ...acting more decidedly against his opponents,
...incresing his list of friends ...but above all, those who were his enemies.
And I will read here what Pier Paolo wrote on November 14, 1974.
"I know the name of the responsible for tragedy in Milan...
"...the December 12, 1969.
"I know the names of those who are responsible for tragedies in Brescia and Bologna,the first months of 1974
"I know the names of those among certain Mass have given orders...
"for the generals, young neo-fascist and finally, common criminals.
"I know all the names and all the facts and all the attacks against the institutions for which they were guilty.
"I know, but I have no evidence".
In the same way we know who are those who are behind the frames:
...those who ordered and executed Pasolini's murder.
As the crowd knew and dismissed him with pain and anger, in his funeral.
That crowd being so heterogeneous knew and knows it.
But like us, it doesn't have evidence.
The Court!
Today, April 26, 1976, ...accepted the fact that Pelosi actually made the crimes he was charged, this Court, based on articles 483 and 488 of the Penal Code, declares Giuseppe Pelosi, with voluntary homicide together with others unknown and of other crimes of which he was accused.
And considering it mature and therefore fully attributable, ...convicted and sentenced to 9 years 7 months and 10 days in jail.
9 years?
Are you crazy?
THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR DOES NOT ACCEPT "TOGETHER WITH OTHERS UNKNOWN" AND OPPOSES THE SENTENCE IMMEDIATELY.
This is an extremely serious fact and it changes everything.
The prosecution does not oppose the verdict, only in "with others unknown."
That is precisely the point.
The boy is in nobody's interest.
What is not acceptable is precisely the participation of others.
The Attorney General is entitled to oppose a nonconvincing sentence.
But if it it haven't been published!
No one would be expected to know the reasons!
Why the rush?
- What can I explain?
- The explanation is simple.
The Tribunal was so convinced of the presence of others they have changed the original charges.
Pelosi is not only guilty of murder, but of collaboration with strangers.
But how?
This is something that involves opening new research...
It seems clear that they do not want make further inquiries!
- And why would we be so bad?
- Because the version of Pelosi, ...the poor boy who kills to get rid of a degenerate, it suits many.
Who are they?
Look, I do not know who killed Pasolini.
They could have all kinds hypothesis:
robbers, kidnappers, ...fascists who wanted to give a lesson or maybe some of those who had been charged.
All the powerful and well known corrupt politicians, whom he accused!
Advocate, don't be childish!
Do you really think someone from the top would be able to order Pasolini's death?
It was not necessary.
There are crimes that have impunity.
There is such a hostility around the victim, ...that it is able to escape unpunished.
Then, there is no doubt and there is a plot of power, to silence the voice of an opponent.
Quite the contrary.
I do not have any truth.
You are the ones who have any doubts
So you are convinced that there can appear things so greasy, that challenges the sentence to avoid further investigations.
You think that it may involve fascist Secret Service or someone even higher.
It is not me who thinks so, you are.
THE CONVICTION OF PELOSI WAS CONFIRMED IN APPEAL AND ABROGATION.
THE PRESENCE OF UNKNOWN WAS CONSIDERED "IMPROBABLE".
NEVER MADE NEW RESEARCH.
"Intelligence will never have weight ever,
"...for the trial of this public opinion.
"Even on the blood of concentration camps, you get...
"...one of the millions of souls our nation...
"...a fair trial, full indignation.
"Every idea is unrealistic and every passion is unreal,
"...to this separated nation For centuries,
"...whose mild wisdom lets them to live, but never be released.
"To show my face and my fragility, ...or raise my voice only, childish, no longer makes sense.
"Cowardice has accustomed us to see others to die in the most terrible way,
"...with a strange indifference.
"I'm dying and it hurts me".

PASOLINI
- AN ITALIAN CRIME-
Ostia Seafront, 2 November 1975, 1.30 AM.
Suspicious car racing on Ostia.
We are going to stop it.
Received.
Do you have I.D. ?
No.
Name?
Pelosi.
I said name, not surname.
Pino.
Pino is a nick-name.
Giuseppe.
Look at me when you talk to me, Giuseppe Pelosi.
What happened to your head?
It hurts.
You've already seen a doctor;
but it was nothing.
Do you mean that you've hurt yourself?
Yes.
Good.
Include this in the statement, so he won't say it was us.
Sergeant.
Look at this.
Pier Paolo Pasolini.
Do you know you've robbed someone famous?
I lost a ring, I think it's in the car.
What ring?
Did you find my cigarettes?
That's enough for you to keep me here?
Sorry, there has been a robbery and since we couldn't phone you, ...we had to visit.
Come in, please.
A car was stolen.
An Alfa Romeo GT 2000 with a Rome number plate.
Yes, this is Pier Paolo's.
And you are...?
His cousin.
Wait here, Ill get him.
Don't make any noise.
His mother is sleeping.
Let me untie it first.
Where is the bag, Dad?
It's there.
It's not.
- Look in the boot.
Dirty and disgusting people.
Where do they come from.
They're all...
Oh, my God.
My God.
My God.
Alfredo, come here.
I killed someone.
Who?
Pasolini.
Pasolini.
The famous one?
Where did they find him?
Where?
Out.
Out.
Clear the area.
Clear the area.
Whose' ball is this?
What are you waiting for?
Clear this area.
Get these people out of here.
It seems they've used a plank from this fence.
As soon as I came here, I realised it was not garbage, but a corpse.
Mr. Moravia, can you make a statement?
Not yet.
My last name is spelled with two 't':
Salvitti.
What's your's?
I'm Furio Colombo.
I work for 'La Stampa'....
'La Stampa', the Agnellis newspaper.
Yes, from Agnelli.
- Write that this is disgusting.
That it was a gang.
They have killed that poor wretch.
He was crying for half an hour:
'Mama, Mama, Mama.'
They were about 4 or 5 of them.
Have you told the police?
Do I look like an idiot?
Did you tell police you lost a ring?
Yes.
Why?
Come with me.
We'll go to the judge.
Why do I have to see the judge now?
- What kind of ring was it?
Gold with a stone.
And I had something engraved.
Something in English.
Only failed to tune in your signature.
Can I go?
Do you understand?
This was found beside the body.
This case should not be here.
I'm not a juvenile judge
Do you know why you have been brought here?
Because if you are a minor and have been with other grown-ups...
Which grown-ups?
- ...this is tried at an ordinary court.
Which means you will be judged by a court for adults and without child protection.
You'll be judged as an adult, as a true criminal.
Were you alone or were there others with you?
I was alone.
Then, Pasolini came to the Stazione Termini with Alfa.
First he spoke with your friends and then he called you, ... you were next to the kiosk at Plaza Esedra.
How much money did he offer you to go with him?
He didn't talked about money.
He just said he would give me a nice gift.
Just that.
A beautiful gift.
But when you came up to the car, did he say what he wanted from you.
He only asked me if I had eaten.
So, he took me to a restaurant next to the Basilica of San Paolo:
...called 'Trattoria al dente'.
But you recognized him?
Did you know who he was?
It is not possible.
Such a famous man.
He's in all newspapers and TV.
I never watch TV.
But there in the restaurant, as a customer was he not welcomed and was he not called by his name.
Paolo.
They called him Paolo.
We stopped outside of Idroscalo.
He wanted a blowjob but I didn't do it.
Then I got out off the car.
I walked to the fence and I saw him coming after me..
He began to touch me and tried to get into my pants.
With this crazy look in his face he said:
'I'll kill you', 'I'll kill you'.
I fought him back because I did not want to have sex with him.
Then he got angry and tried to get his dick up my ass.
And he began to beat and punch me.
When we were rolling on the ground, I grabbed a wooden stick and hit him with all my strength on his head, in his face and neck, everywhere.
I stopped when I saw that he didn't move anymore.
I didn't know what to do.
His face and hands were full of blood.
I got into the car and I drove off.
That's all.
This case doesn't belong here.
I will transfer it to the Juvenile Court.
But was Pelosi alone?
- Was there no-one else in Idroscalo?
You can move now.
I have finished here.
I'll make the prints.
All right.
You, take your clothes off.
No, just on the floor.
We'll pick them up later.
It's amazing that after such a fight you don't have any mud on you.
I stopped at a fountain to wash my hands and clothes.
Water wouldn't remove any bloodstains.
Look here.
There has to be a stain but there's no sign.
Come on, hurry.
Do I have to take off my socks?
Yes, even your socks.
What do you want?
Well?
- Are you Antonio Pelosi?
Yes, I am.
What do you want?
Have you received a call from the police tonight?
Yes, I have.
Been told that your son Pino has been arrested?
Yes, I've been told.
A prisoner in the Juvenile Detention.
Nothing will happen to him.
It's not the first time.
It's bad luck to have a thief as a son.
Your son is charged with murder.
Pier Paolo Pasolini lived in a house in Via Eofrae next to his mother and cousin, with a young university-student and some other friends.
He was very close to his mother, Mrs. Susanna Pasolini and she also played the role of the Virgin Mary... ..in his film 'The Gospel According to St. Matthew'...
Friends say, we wouldn't have want to bring out this chronicle live broadcast...
This way personalities... of culture and the world of cinema to pass away.
What do you want from me?
It's not a good time.
Sorry.
Not now.
Last night you were together in a restaurant?
In Pommidoro.
But Pier Paolo went home alone, by himself.
We both went home.
Paolo to his home and I to mine.
You have worked a lot with Pasolini, as one of his actors.
Can you give us a brief portrait.
Who was Pier Paolo Pasolini.
He was a person who... you see, I have no words.
A great... the greatest person.
And above all, a person who was too good for this world.
Advocate.
Advocate.
Advocate, I'm from Telediario.
Nino, finally.
Who are they?
I don't know.
From the Police.
They want to see Pier Paolo's diary.
They wanted to find out if he had an appointment with someone last night.
No, you can't do that.
- Nino, wait.
Calm down.
Susanna is with Laura.
She still doesn't know.
I disconnected radio and TV.
I can't tell her.
How can we tell her?
If I sign this, I will not be able to do anything.
We'll find a way.
But not now.
When then?
She doesn't speak or ask anything.
It is as if she knows.
I can only say that Pier Paolo was uncomfortable for this society and so he has been removed.
What else?
- I have nothing on Pelosi.
Originally from Guidonia.
Height 1.71 metre.
I would say he is quite athletic.
A nerd couldn't have killed Pasolini.
Have you already found those photos?
Damn.
Why did this idiot have to get killed on a Sunday?
Have you seen the interview with Davoli?
He says, Pelosi would not have been able to do it alone.
What do we care about Ninetto Davoli?
Is he a judge or police?
Is he investigating the corpse?
Boss.
What is this?
The script of Pelosi's hearing.
Congratulations.
Very good.
This is better than crying Ninetto.
A youngster admitted killing Pasolini after a quarrel with the writer,
Pelosi said, he first hit his head with a stick,
The young man had arrived in Rome the afternoon, to meet some friends.
Do you have to listen to this?
- Shut up.
Let me hear.
Then a car came up to me, driven by a man...
At first I didn't recognized him.
He told me that he was Pasolini.
Is he crazy?
Why did he say he knew him?
Did you heard?
He also said that we were at the station?
If the police calls, What shall we say?
The truth.
That we were at the station.
What if they ask about the car?
Pelosi said that Pasolini escorted him to a restaurant.
The youngster also said they stopped on the road to Ostia.
Another driver in the area confirmed this.
Is this story true about the driver?
He is called De Angelis and works in a bar.
He says there was no one else.
Only the Alfa.
No other car.
Does that surprise you?
Pasolini wanted the boy to go with him.
Then, Pasolini and the boy argued about having sex.
I would talk to his friends who were with Pelosi and the owner of the bar.
Perhaps they have some information.
Maybe a raid at Piazza Cinquecento, will reveal something.
Under pressure, some might speak out.
But what do you want me to do, Pigna?
We have terrorist attacks here.
The fascists just shoot, as they did the other day in San Lorenzo.
Robberies, kidnappings, drug trafficking, and you are concerned with that Pasolini.
This boy has a history.
He could have gotten into something quiet ugly.
Previously?
A stolen bike?
What the fuck is this investigation for?
It's just about a gay guy and a hustler and nothing else.
You see?
TV only broadcast... the version of the accused, without any balance.
Thus, fifty million Italians... believe everything Pelosi said.
I understand that.
You're right, but...
You must immediately make a statement.
The press can't be the judge here.
- Advocate, please.
Such a statement would mean a threat to freedom of expression.
I can not do that.
You are one of the largest judicial authorities.
All I can do in this case is recommend maximum discretion.
I guarantee that this will not happen again.
You have my word.
What happened to your arm?
- I broke it when I fell off my bike.
Wasn't that when you fought Pasolini the other night, in the Idroscalo?
No.
As I said, I broke it a month ago.
Look, here I have the evidence.
This hasn't had anything to do with Pasolini.
And how did you get to the Stazione Termini?
By bus.
When Pasolini's car approached, did you recognize him right away?
Sure.
Salvatore even grabbed his arm and asked for a role in his next movie.
And I said, 'Look, I...'
- Did you tell Pelosi, who he was?
You bet.
When I saw him getting into the car, I said:
'Be careful, that Pasolini is capable of anything.'
Are you sure you said: 'Pasolini'?
I think I did,...
That's strange.
Pino said that he knew, right?
How do you know that?
It said so on TV.
- Television is wrong.
How can it be?
- Is it Pelosi or you who is lying.
Perhaps on second thought, Maybe I didn't tell him straight away... but when he returned half an hour later...
Why did he come back?
- Because I had to give him the car keys.
What Car?
Didn't you come by bus?
- I meant I had the keys to his house, ... because his jacket didn't have pockets.
Then he said that he was going to Idroscalo.
No, he didn't say anything.
And then what happened?
Nothing.
He went away.
But this time Pasolini did not come back.
Do you think after killing someone, he'd take the car from the dead and drive around 160 kilometres per hour like an idiot?
Who said he went that fast?
They only said they arrested him.
So, don't make things up.
With a car like that, and not going to drive fast?
I don't think, that he has killed anyone.
Pino 'the frog' is not capable of that.
I say he only stole the car.
Someone else killed him.
Unless they were on drugs.
- What drugs?
Anything.
Ask Braciola, he knows about these things.
What do you mean?
He's a pharmacist?
Go to hell.
And what do you think?
What happened between Pelosi and Pasolini?
What happened?
I don't care.
Good morning.
I am a journalist.
I would like to talk to Ennio Salvitti.
What Salvitti, the fisherman?
- Where can I find him?
The fisherman's gone.
At least four of your type came this morning.
He has denied everything.
He didn't tell your colleagues anything.
Here, the article is signed Giulio Colombo.
They failed to write that we only tried helped that poor Pelosi.
Poor?
He killed him.
I would give a medal to that poor kid.
Do you know what Pasolini wanted from the boy?
Would you like that to happen to your son or your brother?
He got what he deserved.
Go now, go away.
Why did he have to die here?
Couldn't he've died somewhere else?
Leave now, go.
A little to the right
I was close to Pier Paolo when he was very young.
He introduced me to poetry and film.
I was his assistant in his first movie, 'Accattone'.
I think that this is not a crime against a person or against a brother, but a crime against Art, intelligence and poetry.
I don't know his murderers, and neither what they did, but anyway Pier Paolo was telling the truth.
Now they have shut him up forever.
This is something horrible and monstrous.
The Press Office, please.
They took the decision to silence him forever.
And that deeply disturbs us.
As the Secretary of the group 'Social House' consider it my duty to denounce speculations, that the News have been dedicated to help Pier Paolo Pasolini's murder.
It is scandalous to say that this murder is a crime against Art.
We, and with us, millions of Italians, do not feel represented by the work of Pier Paolo Pasolini.
They have only weak arguments.
Don't take it too seriously.
It will be nothing.
It was self defence.
What are you supposed to do, when you are attacked?
Are the Judges protecting queers?
Exactly.
Self-defence will give you only a few months.
But if you start to talk, you'll be out of here with your feet first.
Are you Pelosi's Attorney?
Why?
Do you know anything?
No.
Only what I've heard around.
He ended pretty badly, poor Pier Paolo.
Why?
Did you know Pasolini?
How couldn't I have?
Not personally, of course.
Always hanging around with the same car.
Then getting old.
Whether you are famous or not, it happens to all of us.
And that night I saw him in his car going round and round.
Then I met a friend and I didn't pay any more attention.
Did you see Pelosi, there at Stazione?
Maybe, I remember...
a handsome guy.
But he did not kill Pasolini.
Everyone knows that.
Yes?
The people in control there killed him.
They are like a mafia.
For some time they had targeted Pasolini.
Why?
- He asked too many questions.
He had been warned twice already.
How many?
A car followed him for an ambush.
Would you tell a Judge all this?
Listen to me, please.
We protest strongly.
We have a right to see Pelosi.
We have been appointed.
- Sorry, dear Vincenzo.
He is Vincenzo, I am Tommaso.
- Please forgive me.
I meant Tommaso.
In any case, no one can see or talk with your client now.
Perone, but why not?
I prefer that no-one speaks with him before I have questioned him.
Hello.
Have you heard what the lawyers say about Pelosi?
- No, what?
They say his confession is unconvincing and that he will be tied as a civil case, represented by Marazzita.
'That Saturday night, Giuseppe Pelosi must have had other helpers.'
You see, this is strange.
Obviously, they think that he is covering for somebody.
Perhaps out of fear.
If I had to defend myself and I was... convinced that there were other perpetrators I'd do the same.
Show that he was just a simple accessory.
So, why does Pelosi insist that he was alone?
Because it enables him... to be tried as a minor.
He knows that if the judge accepts him as a minor, the case will end quickly.
Have you studied Law, Perosi?
- No, it is simple experience.
The past year he has gotten rid of a charge of robbery, only to be minor.
Anyway, as I understand Pier Paolo has hunted the fascists.
I don't mean physically, but fascism and the air around us and the horror we breathe in every day.
Or, perhaps, he hunted them even physically.
Listen.
I have no intention starting a political process.
No?
- No.
Why?
- Because it is political.
You'll see.
The first has a history of carrying weapons and so forth.
The second is a beginner, but the other day he attacked a passerby.
This, attempted murder and robbery.
Released after a time.
And this is the worst.
Me.
They're all junkies.
People who go cold turkey will kill their own parents to steal a watch.
Yes, everything is fine.
But what to do with Pelosi?
Two of them have been seen in the bar Pelosi usually goes to.
Well?
What do they have to do with Pasolini ?
What do they have to do with Pasolini?
Haven't you seen the pamphlets?
I kept one as a souvenir.
Cute, right?
Remember what I said.
I do not want to call a guard.
I thought this were the lawyers.
What lawyers.
Did you hear what they are saying?
They say that maybe you were not alone.
You know that if you were not alone, if there was... someone else they will give you a life sentence.
Never.
You haven't slept, right?
How am I going to sleep.
Watch out.
You're hurting me.
Like those two.
You must change lawyers.
Yes, indeed.
He agreed to carry Pelosi's defence and I haven't wasted your time.
What is this?
Books by Pasolini.
I read, to learn.
First, because it is not my usual habit to demonise anyone.
And secondly, because maybe these books contain the mystery of his disease.
An erotic paranoia, which, that night at the Idroscalo, led to tragedy.
Strange things happen these days.
The communists, who want equality asking for special treatment for...
Pasolini, only because he was an accomplished artist.
The case is clear.
Pelosi struck to defend himself.
To defend his honour.
An absolute tragic outcome, of course.
But this desperate outcome is symbolic of the proletariat revolt, the rebels against exploitation a pseudo-libertarian culture.
It is very comfortable to go hunting... by driving an Alfa Romeo GT 2000.
This process will clear the way for cultural terrorism and show who Pier Paolo Pasolini truly was.
May his soul rest in peace.
Come on, pull Pasolini's car in.
Quick.
Come quick.
Look what you do.
You have to make the autopsy.
It's too important and I don't trust anyone else.
Sorry, Nino, you can't ask me to do that.
Yes, because you're the only one that can do it.
Court Administration experts have been unable... to examine the body at the crime scene.
They could only see it in the Morgue.
The Judge has not yet questioned Pelosi's friends local residents, or the regular users of the station.
They have not even made at least one Car expert analysis of Pier Paolo's vehicle.
You know that in a trial for minors, the prosecution has only 40 days.
We have nothing.
- What do you expect from me?
I can't do miracles.
Tomorrow, at the funeral, all evidence will be buried for ever:
...body, investigation and attention of the public opinion... and the words of Pelosi will stay as the only truth.
And according to you, what is the truth?
So far I have some impressions based only at the first hearing of the boy.
The impressions also count.
Do you think Pelosi is telling the truth or not?
No.
I don't think so.
It seems too unreal to have happened exactly like this.
How do you see this case?
- I'm learning.
We will not publish any of this.
- Why?
Too violent and tragic.
No-one would believe that the idiot Pelosi did this by himself.
Anyway it is better that we keep ahead of our competitors.
Okay, let's begin.
Two large skin abrasions at the front and side.
Bruising on the cheekbone and left jaw.
Jaw fracture at two points.
Transverse lesion outer ear, left atrium.
Right ear injury with the ear nearly torn off.
Some finger-edge fractures left hand and a deep cut on thumb.
Fracture of the sixth and seventh right rib.
On the left side, fracture of the sixth, seventh, eighth and the ninth rib.
In summary, ten fractures all together.
Capsular wounds in the liver.
Was this all featured in the Report to the Court expert?
I don't think they had read it.
We've lost first and foremost a poet... and in the world there are not so many poets.
Only three or four are born every century.
At the end of this century, Pasolini is among the very few poets remembered.
A poet should be something sacred.
The cause of death was fracture in the heart caused by the push of a car.
We are done, Paolo.
'Dear Pelosino I received your mail.
I've been to Inacasa, but Johnny was not there.
'As soon as I see him, I'll tell him to write to you'.
Who is this Johnny?
Is he that friend of yours:
Johnny, the Gypsy?
What do you care?
Is it important?
Now you're in jail, do not give up and think about what you've done.
You have to pretend that nothing happened.
Just think one day you will be free and that day is near.
Goodbye.
Your friend, Braciola.
Who the hell is Braciola?
The son of Jack the Ripper?
This comes from Germany.
Do you know anyone there?
Four poor fellows who migrated there ten years ago, have made a collection.
With all these fans we are going to get rich.
There is another version of the death of Pasolini.
They killed two motorcyclists.
What story is that?
Mysterious witness?
Who has told Fallaci there were other perpetrators?
Is it possible that you are total idiots?
Even in a newspaper article we look like idiots.
How is this possible?
What have we done so far?
Where are the expert reports of Pasolini's car?
Where are the interviews of those in the Idroscalo?
Why hasn't the bar of the Station raided?
They had to be here.
We know them one by one.
Can you tell me why you haven't done any of this ?
Why were you on the streets at this hour?
Didn't you have rheumatism?
What about you?
- Yes, of course.
I was there by chance, looking for a pharmacy.
Did you know Pasolini?
Who doesn't?
He was a great director.
No...
I mean, had you seen him before?
Sure, on TV and the movies.
I mean if you saw him there at the Stazione Termini, where you were.
Listen:
I told you I was looking for a pharmacy.
Stop being a fool, idiot.
Have you seen him at the Station?
Perhaps one of those other times that you were 'looking for pharmacy'.
No.
I never saw him there.
Good morning, Police.
Do you live here?
Yes.
Have you been questioned?
- No, nobody was here.
The worst job always comes to us, eh, Professor?
Pigna.
There are tracks here where the car was.
Why wasn't the place sealed?
As soon as I arrived, I sealed it.
But I was not the first to arrive.
But how can we do the research?
How can we distinguish the tracks?
Look here.
And here.
And here.
And here.
It looks like an act of a lunatic.
Are you trying to cover up for someone?
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Goodbye, professor.
I've told you the story twenty times.
I'm sick of it.
How did you come to the Stazione?
- In my car.
Not true.
Your friends have said that night you went to the Stazione by bus.
So who are you?
I'm only going to answer to the judge.
I'm the attorney for the family of Pasolini.
You're going to have to answer my questions.
Is it true?
- It's true.
Maybe my friends, as I don't have the card, have thought it was a stolen car.
However, my colleague, the 850 was acquired legitimate.
Here's the bill for the acquisition.
- Sure.
It cost a lot of money.
Where did you get the money from?
That's my business.
I'm here to talk about Pasolini, not my car.
Let's go on.
You didn't realize that he was injured by the surface of the car?
You did not even think that he could have been alive?
So why did you say to your cell-partner that you had killed Pasolini?
I said Pasolini, because when the police stopped me, I was told that the car was his.
No, I did not asked that.
I asked: why did you say: 'I've killed?
Because I thought that after that beating and blood and time that had happened...
Then you say you gave him... such a beating that he could have been dead.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What kind of questioning is that against the defendant?
Are we in the KGB?
Come on, calm lawyer.
Then, I will formulate the question for you.
When you left the place, what did you think?
I thought only of getting away.
I did not think of Pasolini.
I wanted to get away, nothing else.
When did the letter from Braciole come?
- Sunday.
Can you make a copy?
- Yes, in the office.
I have never supported homosexuals.
They are worse than others.
In this world, those who treat us badly, we also treat badly.
Homosexuals, thieves and murderers are scam.
Pasolini, only because he was someone to wrote something, us and the media give him importance.
Yesterday I saw the funeral of Pasolini on TV.
There were many people, like the President of the Republic.
I say it's not fair.
The State punishes criminals and thieves.
Why then do they honour homosexuals?
Homosexuals.
Sit.
Do you agree?
- Sure, he asked for it.
He could have stayed in the North and not come to Rome to molest young people.
He liked sissies.
- No, the hard ones.
This is one of his poem on Rome.
Listen.
'City great and miserable... '... who showed me how happy men and the wild are teaching children.
'Those little things, which reveal the greatness of life.
'I walk fast and secure in the crowded streets... '...and go to another man without a tremble.
'Not be ashamed to see how the fingers counting money... '...the worker is sweaty... '...with his weathered face in the colour of a perpetual summer.
'City great and miserable... '...you made me to discover a life unknown to me, '...until I discovered that each person was a world.'
This was Pasolini and this is what I taught you.
Braciola, Calabrone and Johnny, all friends of Pelosi.
Keep an eye on them, who they are and what they do.
I know Braciola.
They are related to the Monarchist Union.
Johnny calls him 'The Gypsy' and his parents own a carousel.
He left Marmo Jail recently.
For a small crime, stealing a bike.
Was he in jail at the day of the homicide?
No, he was out.
Why do you want to know?
Forget it.
Sit.
Sit.
Well, ...what is so important?
I have a meeting in 10 minutes.
What about the report?
I've had my eye on that bar for months.
The Romans use to gather there.
But earlier this year, when the kidnappings and assaults began, the french begun to appear.
Here is an important one.
His name is Gilles Marcel.
His two main activities are dressing as a women and selling drugs.
Inside his bag, a kilo of heroin.
We arrested him an hour ago.
The National Vanguard is:
Black Terrorist, suspected for bombing.
Continue.
National Vanguard and New Order which is the same as saying that the fascists... are using bombs, have joined and now call themselves 'Popular Struggle.'
They are financed by kidnapping, robbery and drug trafficking.
And the evidence?
Where are they?
This one here called Luigi Mariano, a banker... in Brindisi was kidnapped several months ago.
And behind all of this is Concutelli, military commander of the Black Terrorists.
The conclusion is that Rome is like Chicago, right?
No.
The conclusion is that the fascists and the underworld are allied.
And now they do the assaults, kidnappings and drug trafficking together.
Before the fascists only recruited people for beatings,
Now they ask for other things, like killing, making bombs and worse like murdering Pasolini.
I do not make silly arrests, just because you have... some ideas about the fascists and and all that crap without any evidence.
You have nothing.
Is this a report?
So you work here?
It seems that one is reading 'L'Unita'.
That is to childish.
Now, draw a picture of yourself.
Did you forget your hands.
Didn't they teach you to draw on the College?
Sorry, wait a minute.
Let him at least finish.
What did you mean when you said?
That he is a savage, a beast?
That everybody already knows.
He is a monster, right?
And you, how do you judge your child's behaviour?
And how should I?
Don't you understand you have to survive?
You mean that Pino did well doing that?
- Whoever did wrong was Pasolini.
He should have stayed writing poetry.
Because I stay in my house, when I return at night, dead tired.
To me these things have never happened.
How do you feel about what your father says?
What do you mean, feel about?
Does it seem normal to you what you have done?
I don't know.
In short, of everything that happened, is there anything... you wish wouldn't have happened?
Yes, of course.
- What?
The newspapers wrote it is their fault.
It is not their fault that I'm what I am.
- Like what?
You know....
Is there anything else that you dislike?
- They call me 'Frog'.
I've got this nickname in the newspapers.
Do I have a frog face?
There are guys who have seen me on TV and... they say that they dream of me, not a frog.
Death.
Say another word for it.
To finish everything.
And birth?
I can't think of anything.
Well?
- More work.
Work, Luigi?
I would have preferred to see you tomorrow.
Why tomorrow?
We have no time to lose.
Give me this.
Listen, Nino.
Sorry to bring bad news but I think, he is immature.
What?
Immature?
- Immature.
What do you mean, he has killed a man.
Even a five year old child knows, that taking someone's life is something that...
Yes, I know.
But he... no...
doesn't even know that...
He has no moral.
Conditions where he has lived so far...
Stop with this psychological bullshit.
For you even Cain would be innocent.
You realize that if the Court accepts him as immature, he'll be free the next day.
Yes, I know.
If you want, you can always ignore... the expert report.
Of course.
I won't submit this.
Andreotti, Fanfani, Rumour and at least one dozen other powerful Democrats should be taken prisoners.
And being processed for a number of crimes:
bribes about oil with industry and bankers, ...collaboration with the CIA, illegal use of secret information, responsibility in the massacres of Milan, Brescia and Bologna by landscape destruction and urban Italy,
...for their role in the anthropological degradation of the Italians, ...and by the wild explosion of mass-culture and media and for their role in TV criminality.
Without criminal proceedings they come to believe... you can do anything in our country.
And it seems clear that the respectability of some Democrats or the morals of the Communists has been good for nothing.
August 28, 1975 Pier Paolo Pasolini
Pasolini wanted to prosecute all.
And you know why?
Because he wanted revenge on all criminal proceedings initiated against him.
Pasolini.
How persecuted was he?
What kind of a victim or a monster built by the Press.
Where are the facts?
October 15, 1949, arrested for the first time for corruption of minors.
January 1, 1951, Chioggia:
arrested for drunkenness.
July 21, 1955:
Taken to Court by Judicial Council of Milan for pornographic contents in his book 'Young Life'.
Doctor, your toga.
All right, put it on the bed and try not to wrinkle it.
Today we'll have all of the TV-stations and must look good.
You can go, Gara.
February 9, 1960: arrested for the sad facts of Via di Panico.
July 16, 1960, Anzio: reported for corruption of minors.
November 18, 1961: reported for assault with a deadly weapon.
Over 30 cases has the man had against him and he always came out innocent.
Everything went up in smoke.
But, gentlemen, where there's smoke, there's fire.
On the 2nd of February 1976, ...the Juvenile Court composed of
Dr. Alfredo Carlo Moro, President, Dr. Giuseppe Psalm, Judge
Dr. Matteo Guarino, court fees, Dr. Maria Grazia Milone, Honorary Judge.
With intervention of the Public Ministry, represented by... the prosecutor, Dr. Giuseppe Santarsiero and with the assistance of the Subscribed Chancellor, Dr. Roberto Carnevali, meets the Board of Hearing, to discuss the criminal case of the preliminary investigation against
Giuseppe Pelosi, accused.
The defendant is assisted by Attorney Rocco Mangia.
The civil Court, Susanna Pasolini, has already been established and represented by their lawyers, Antonio Marazzita and Guido Calvi.
Being a minor, the case will take place behind closed doors.
I confirm everything I said and I have nothing to add.
It couldn't been said better.
...but I have some questions.
Ah, yes.
Sorry, president, could I...
The defendant requests that his mother leaves... the room during questioning.
The Court accepts this request.
Please, ma'am.
The will call you, as soon as possible.
When you went to the Piazza, to the kiosk, did you know that there were men, who...?
Yes, I knew.
And that night, had you planned to go with any of these men?
Yes.
Have you had done it before?
- No, never.
That night was the first time.
Because I needed the money.
Important needs, I guess.
I needed it for a car.
Was there any other reason to behave in this way?
Some guys do it as a women, but I wanted to do it as a man.
I wanted to see if doing it with a man would disgust me.
And your reaction came when you were asked for oral sex?
I resisted at first.
- But this is absurd.
Then why did you go with the man?
And why did you not say this in previous hearings?
Mr President, he is trying to intimidate the defendant.
Attorney Mangia, I assure you that
I wouldn't allow this.
Please sit down.
Do you understand the question?
Why do you say now that you resisted?
What's wrong if I agree first and then change my mind?
I left the car and I thought it was over.
I only got into his car, to see what it was like.
He came after me and started to touch me.
I told him to stop because I did not want to do it as a woman.
He picked up a piece of wood and wanted to... use it on me.
I said: 'Are you crazy?
'
Then he started to beat me with that stick.
I kicked him and tried to run away.
He ran after me and jumped on top of me.
He kept beating me, I grabbed the stick and started to hit him.
But then the stick broke.
I pulled some wood off the fence and hit him on the head with force.
I was in shock, with my face and hands covered with blood.
I could not see anything.
So I got into his car and drove off.
If you were together at a restaurant, you must have talked, right?
He was speaking.
- About what?
I don't know?
Where he worked, where he lived;... which school he went to and things like that.
Was it nice?
- Yes, it was.
It was nice at that time.
But later, when you left the Idroscalo, what happened then?
In your previous interviews, you said that he seemed to have crazy eyes.
What did you mean by that?
I repeat the question.
- I understood the question.
I don't know?
Have you heard?
You know what they've done these idiots?
What?
After the meeting the other day, they raided the bar where I was researching.
Arrested ten people who had nothing to do with it.
They spoiled six months of my work.
Yes, because...
Because they're idiots and Fuckheads.
Who finds the fascists and those from Marseille now?
Calm down.
They took me off the case.
I have been transferred.
They call it a promotion.
Because I found a picture of Braciola, the friend of Pelosi.
He's on here.
But you'll have to find him yourself.
It could be a good clue.
Why do you do that?
I don't handle this case any longer.
I too have been 'upgraded'.
Why have you told of this?
This is only a hypothesis.
Perhaps.
No one else would have said it.
It had to be me.
Do you think that perhaps some of... the extreme right, linked to the underground, would have...?
I do not believe anything.
I have given the information as is.
You have to do the thinking.
Are you saying they interfered with the research?
I have to go.
Goodbye.
Good luck.
No, Pier Paolo never removed his glasses.
Not even at home.
Not for a moment.
You can assume that he wouldn't have left his car without wearing them.
Do you recognize this jersey and these in-soles?
No, the jersey is not Pier Paolos.
I don't know to whom it belongs.
Could they not have been in the car for a longer time?
I washed the car the day before.
That same afternoon, Pier Paolo came back.
I'm sure that they were not there.
Maybe they were in the trunk.
- Absolutely not.
I also cleaned the trunk and there was no jersey or in-soles.
But do they belong to the boy?
No, not to him.
We've checked.
I did not want to kill him.
He forced me to.
I did not want to kill him.
It was an accident.
Silence.
Can you tell us where exactly you found this jersey?
On the back seat, I think.
But the investigating experts say they found it in the trunk.
It is possible that someone has moved it.
Please try to be as accurate as possible.
It does matter if the thing was in the trunk or back seat.
In the trunk, it could be simply cloth.
But in the back seat, since it didn't belonged to the victim... or the accused, we could assume that, Maybe there was... a third person in the car.
It was on the back seat.
- Thanks.
You can go.
Are you Pugliese?
- And who are you?
We have an appointment.
- I don't think so.
Don't you have an appointment with Braciole?
Is it you?
- Sure.
And my brother, Bracioletta.
Go to hell.
- You go to hell.
What's all this?
I have a job to be done and I need 2 guys.
And they sent two amateurs.
You are amateur.
Do you understand?
- Do not worry.
Listen, let's leave it.
- Wait.
Not so fast.
How much money are we talking?
Ten grand a head.
But only if you can work this.
Do you think I'm afraid?
Bye.
Come back when you're a little older.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You are talking to the Pasolini killers.
What do you mean?
If you want someone like Pasolini killed, you need me Motherfucker.
Who would call you?
- And why the fuck do you care?
What the hell do I care?
What are you doing, dammit.
Hey, put the gun down.
I knew he was an under-cover cop.
Signed 'Braciola'.
Did you write this?
Why?
Is it forbidden to write a friend in jail?
So you know Pelosi well.
- So what?
Here you talk about a mutual friend a certain Johnny, 'The Gipsy'.
What about Jonny?
He killed to steal a watch.
He has confessed to it.
Johnny is not bad.
It's just, that night he was a little stoned.
Perhaps he was too high when he lent a hand to Pelosi.
I told you everything is a lie.
So why did you tell the police, that you killed Pasolini that night?
I don't know.
Because...
What do you mean 'because?
'
I did nothing.
I only said it for, well, to be important.
And now?
Why did you retract everything?
Mom, go away.
I don't want you to be in the newspapers.
Take a photo of me.
I am more handsome than Pino.
Nothing so far differs... even slightly from Pino Pelosi's version.
None of the three friends' versions... differ from Stazione's, only that they lied about arriving in a car they thought was stolen.
Media revelations only created confusion.
This latest farce of the two brothers to criminalised themselves... is just as important to their fellow adventurers.
May I ask, Mr. President, can we now go to what really matters?
Let us establish for once and for all... whether or not it was homicide.
Let's see if Pelosi is immature, or are we wasting our time?
Indeed, Mr. President, for this purpose, ...here is the psychiatric report of the civil court.
I submit this to this Court.
According to our expert, Pelosi must be regarded as immature.
We could have stopped to let this report out.
But, look, Mr. President, we believe what we can learn from Pier Paolo was his passionate love for truth.
We would be of disservice to his memory, if we settled for less.
We disagree with the evaluation of our expert... but we would be wrong if we did not submit that report.
The Alfa Romeo 2000 GT was standing next to the fence by the football field.
This is the area of the incident.
A wide open area, as you can see.
Here at this point, about 70 meters away, Pasolini's body was found.
But it was here, next to the car, where the first attack took place.
And it was here where his shirt was found.
In the first phase, Pasolini was violently beaten on the head and the wounds begin to bleed abundantly.
This is proofed by the blood found on the shirt.
Look at it.
It's not torn anywhere.
If Pasolini himself took the shirt off during the attack.
We would have found clogged blood.
What could have caused a blood-loss of this magnitude?
If we believe Pelosi's testimony, that this plank, which is marked 'Buttinelli', ...giving us the name of the owner of this house came from the exact point where the body was found.
Pelosi himself admitted that this plank... was only used at the end of fight.
The only other heavy object he admits to having used... is this.
A fragile stick which would have been destroyed after the first strike.
So how can a stick of this size cause such serious injury?
It is impossible.
Therefore, it is logical at the first phase, another heavy object... or another aggressor had to be present to carry out those blows.
The wounds found on Pasolini's head, ...are in an area largely supplied by capillaries, ... and would usually cause a haemorrhage, ...in which blood gushes violently outwards every time the heart pumps.
So at the end of what Pelosi calls man-to-man fight Pasolini's body was completely covered with blood and mud.
Pino Pelosi, however, at the time of his arrest didn't have a trace of Pasolini's blood on him,
There was only blood on this sweater.
He had traces of his own blood on his shirt... and some stains of Pasolini's blood on the right leg of his pants.
Nothing else.
- But I had a cut here.
Yes, indeed, ...the boy had a small head injury, but this injury was a clean cut without abrasion or bruising.
A wound, which could not have been produced by a stick or wooden board.
And now?
- Very simple.
When chased by the police car,...
Pelosi was forced to stop abruptly.
During the impact, he hit his head against the roof, ...which indeed was found stained with his blood.
So, what are you saying?
- Silence.
The accused is not allowed to interrupt.
You may only speak when asked.
Go on, professor.
Pelosi's version of events seem therefore unlikely true.
How is it possible to cause Pasolini's injuries with a plank of rotted wood?
How is it possible that after this dramatic man-to-man fight, he described he was not covered in blood and mud?
I had a wash at the fountain.
If this was true, then at the time of arrest, he would have been soaked.
There is no mention of that in the police report.
This is outrages.
It was like I said.
We have already heard your statement.
If you continue to interrupt, I will remove you from this Court.
I apologise, Mr. Chairman, it will not happen again.
So far it seems possible for us to outline, ...a reconstruction on those facts.
Shortly after midnight,
Pier Paolo Pasolini and Pino Pelosi arrive at Idroscalo by car.
The car stops at the bottom of the football field.
They start talking.
The writer takes off his glasses and puts them down in the car, ...which we later found there.
Pelosi also places a pack of cigarettes and lighter there.
But these, inexplicably, were not found.
It is then when oral sex took place.
Then, Pelosi says he left the car and was followed by Pasolini.
...He says: 'just to have a look.'
For what?
It is total darkness and Pasolini didn't put his glasses back on, which, according to his cousin Graziella Chiarcossi, he never took off.
Everything indicates that the writer did not leave the car by his own choice, ...but was pulled out by force and with extreme violence.
Pasolini is wounded and bleeding heavily.
But he is still alive and in a position to remove his shirt to protect his wounds.
If they only wanted to teach him a lesson, this would have been enough.
But this was only the beginning of a massacre.
The autopsy revealed, Pasolini testicles were violently traumatised and bruised.
If this trauma had occurred in the first phase, as Pelosi claimed it would have prevented Pasolini from any defence reaction.
Not allowing him therefore to get up, take off his shirt and walk about 70 meters.
I ask you now to put your attention on this photo.
This photo was not available to my colleagues who did a previous autopsy.
I leave it up to you to decide on the reasons... for this incredible omission.
I can only say that the omission of this photo... has led my colleagues to miss out... on the injuries inflicted by the car.
If they had studied this photo they would have realised that Pelosi's statement... did not respond to the truth.
Look carefully at this.
These marks of the left tire clearly show what happened to the poet's body.
And to clear any doubt, I asked a car tyre expert.
As you can see they match.
Therefore, the car ran over Pasolini.
It didn't follow this track, ...then it could have been accidental.
Instead it continued here.
And why did the car make this absurd curve?
Because the driver wanted to crush the body?
I do not know if that was what Pino Pelosi wanted.
I do not know if he was driving the car at the time of the collision, ...but the murderer was.
Pelosi was there and his participation is certain.
He says he stopped at a fountain to wash the blood off his hands.
Why then, hasn't the steering wheel of the car been stained?
He said that Pasolini's blood on the roof of the car were left by his bloody hands.
But he forgot that the stains were found in the passenger's and not the driver's side.
Only two scenarios are possible.
Either Pelosi's hands were stained... with blood from the passengers side while someone else was driving.
Or an accomplice with bloody hands sat in the passenger's seat while Pelosi, whose hands were not blood-stained, was driving the car.
In either case it seems clear that someone else, who had participated in the aggression, ....must have got into the car with Pelosi.
Not true.
Not true.
- Quiet or you'll leave the court.
I maintain that the thorough examination of all evidence, ...the club, table, clothes and Pasolini's injuries, ...invalidate Pelosi's story, and show what really happened.
We have to conclude this case on the basis that Pasolini was the victim of a crime involving several persons.
It's a conspiracy.
A conspiracy.
They have invented everything.
Everything.
This is outrageous.
A farce.
I don't know how to thank you for all you've done and going to continue to do.
But, I don't know how to explain, ...I feel such a loss and much less strong.
It happened to all of us.
We all have lost something priceless.
Indeed Guido, something priceless.
What if the Court requests a Civil trial?
They will calculated the damages.
And how much was Pier Paolo's life worth?
What do you do, Graziella?
I don't want anything from Pelosi.
That's how I feel.
Pier Paolo would have been horrified.
We can ask for 1 lira.
Just symbolic, to allowing us to continue the case.
Graziella is right.
We have given the Court all the evidence needed.
And it makes no sense to ask for compensation.
Do not ask anything.
We don't have to explain our decision.
This is important.
- But it is a huge risk.
If we retreat now, we can't be present in later phases of trial.
Nor can we appeal, in case the sentence is unjust.
Wait a minute.
Yes, sure.
We don't participate any longer or make our voice heard.
That's a risk we must take.
Instead be the voice of Pier Paolo:
...his books, his ideas.
Try to do what he had done.
Is this what you meant?
We want Pelosi convicted.
But his penalty will be insignificant and it is impossible to evaluate because Pelosi is subjected to this Juvenile Court.
While Pasolinis memory belongs to all of us, because it belongs to another reality.
With these words, Mr. President, the family of Pasolini like to inform of their intends to withdraw their participation of the... civil court and doesn't ask for any compensation.
In our view, execution of the murder and the plurality of the executing have been demonstrated.
But we can, ...from the moment we decide to abandon this process, ...remember what we all lost the night of November 2, 1975.
That night, in which the heart of Pier Paolo Pasolini stopped beating;
...his eyes to reveal and his conscience to judge.
Do you have a light?
Pasolini has been defined many times as a provocateur.
Perhaps because in recent times he had intensified his interventions, ...acting more decidedly against his opponents, ...increasing his list of friends but above all, those who were his enemies.
And I will read here what Pier Paolo wrote on November 14, 1974.
I know the name of the responsible for the tragedy in Milan the December 12, 1969.
I know the names of those who are responsible for the tragedies... in Brescia and Bologna in 1974...
I know the names of those who have given the orders... to the generals, the young neo-fascist and the common criminals.
I know all names and all facts and all attacks... against the aforementioned.
I know, but I have no evidence.
In the same way we know all who are behind this crime, ...those who ordered and executed Pasolini's murder.
As the crowd said Goodbye to him with pain and anger, at his funeral.
That crowd knew and knows it.
But like us, they don't have any evidence.
The Court.
Today, on April 26, 1976, ...the Court accepted the fact that Pelosi actually made... the crimes he was charged with.
I accordance with articles 483 and 488, the Court declares Giuseppe Pelosi, guilty for voluntary manslaughter, together with others unknown.
And considering him mature and therefore fully liable, ...convicted and sentenced to 9 years 7 months and 10 days in jail.
9 years?
Are you crazy?
THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR DOES NOT ACCEPT...
'TOGETHER WITH OTHERS UNKNOWN'
This is an extremely serious fact and it changes everything.
The prosecution does not oppose the verdict, only 'with others unknown.'
That is precisely the point.
The boy is of nobody's interest.
What is not acceptable is the participation of others.
The Attorney General is entitled to oppose a non-convincing sentence.
But if it hadn't been published... no-one would be expected to know the reasons.
Why the rush?
There's no explanation?
- The explanation is simple.
The Tribunal was so convinced of the presence of... others they have changed the original charges.
Pelosi is not only guilty of murder, but of collaboration with strangers.
But how?
This is something that involves opening new research.
It seems clear that they do not want to make further inquiries.
And why would that be so bad?
- Because the version of Pelosi, ...the poor boy who kills a degenerate, suits many.
Who are they?
Look, I do not know who killed Pasolini.
There could have been all kinds:
robbers, kidnappers, ...fascists who wanted to teach a lesson or maybe some of those who had been charged.
All the powerful and well known corrupt politicians, whom he accused.
Advocate, don't be childish.
Do you really think someone from the top would be able to order Pasolini's death?
It was not necessary.
There are crimes that have impunity.
There is such a hostility around the victim, ...that one is able to escape unpunished.
Then, there is no doubt and there is a plot... to silence the voice of an opponent.
Quite the contrary.
I do not have any truth.
You are the ones who have doubts.
So you are convinced that there can appear things... so greasy, that challenges the sentence... to avoid further investigations.
You think that it may involve fascist Secret Service or someone even higher.
It is not me who thinks so, you are.
THE CONVICTION OF PELOSI WAS CONFIRMED
IN APPEAL AND ABROGATION.
THE PRESENCE OF UNKNOWN WAS CONSIDERED 'IMPROBABLE'.
NEVER MADE NEW RESEARCH.
'Intelligence will never have weight ever, '...for the trial of this public opinion.
'Even on the blood of concentration camps, you get... '...one of the millions of souls our nation... '...a fair trial, full indignation.
'Every idea is unrealistic and every passion is unreal, '...to this separated nation for centuries, '...whose mild wisdom lets them to live, but never be released.
'To show my face and my fragility, ...or raise my voice only, childish, no longer makes sense.
'Cowardice has accustomed us to see others to die in the most terrible way, '...with a strange indifference.
'I'm dying and it hurts me'.
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO ELIO BALLETTI, FRANCO BORNI
AND VITTORIO MEZZOGIORNO
Agranon..., ...will you promise me that when we're old we'll still come back here and sit under these trees?
When we're old?
We'll do it every year, on the anniversary of our wedding day.
And one day we can bring our grandchildren..., ...lots of grandchildren.
Ten years ago a marriage between our families would have been impossible.
Does anyone even remember what the feud was about?
No one in my family remembers.
Whatever it was it's centuries old, and it ends when we are joined.
We'll definitely bring our grandchildren.
We can tell them that peace was finally made here.
And that one of their parents was made here.
After our wedding, maybe.
That's very strange.
Strange?
There's somebody out there.
Who is it?
Who's there?
Run!
No!
Get your hands off me!
We've got the girl!
Come on!
Agranon, help me!
You see, Xena, the way I look at it..., ...life is an adventure to be explored.
And without adventure, what's the point?
Granted with you sometimes it gets a bit too adventurous.
But that's what makes it interesting.
Who was it that said "If curiosity is the food of life then adventure is a meal."?
Sounds like something you might have said.
Oh, maybe it was me.
Speaking of a meal...
Places like this always have the best food.
And atmosphere.
Two important ingredients to fine dining.
I jest, you know?
Let's see what's on the menu.
You whistled?
Yeah, wait for me.
Lovely.
Now, this is the salt of the earth.
Well, you gotta admit, the people of Lerna might never appreciate who you are but King Gregor certainly did.
He would've lost his whole kingdom, if it weren't for you.
Ale, please.
Yep, the baby got a home.
Gregor got a son Pandora got some rest.
And the way you figured out that prophecy, well, I, for one, am still amazed.
Ok!
You win!
Did you ever notice that we never have trouble getting a table?
A mystery to me.
That's if you're for hire.
-Hey...
-Not that kind of hire, Gabrielle.
Go on.
-May I sit down?
-No.
Keep talking.
I'm not sure where to begin.
-Who did you want me to kill?
-No one unless you have to.
May I please sit down?
You're new at this, so listen up.
Anyone coming into a place like this, carrying a bag of gold is looking to live a short life with a messy death.
I don't care.
I've gotta get her back.
Her?
My fiancee.
She's been abducted and if she's not returned, there will be a war.
What?
Who kidnapped her?
The king of Beocia thinks we did it.
My own father thinks they did it to have an excuse to attack us.
-Nice legs!
-So, who do you think did it?
Sorry.
That happens sometimes.
You were saying...?
I think Jana was taken by someone else.
Someone whose livelihood would be destroyed if this marriage took place.
Does this someone have a name?
He's an arms dealer who operates from the walled city of...
Tracus.
I've heard of Mezentius.
I imagine you might have.
Tracus seems to be a crossroads for murderers and mercenaries.
No offense taken.
Sorry.
You must help us.
We're talking about two nations going to war.
I don't work for nations.
I don't work for money.
And I won't work for you.
Please!
Please...
You're right.
I don't know what I'm doing.
All I know is the woman that I love more than my own breath My Jana, I love her, and I will die for her if I have to.
Ask anything of me, and it's yours.
First, there are hungry people in this town who could use that gold.
I'll take this.
And you'll get your Jana back.
Thank you.
Can I see?
Give me that!
In the time of ancient gods..., warlords and kings, a land in turmoil cried out for a hero.
She was Xena.
A mighty princess forged in the heat of battle.
The power.
The passion.
The danger.
Her courage will change the world.
XENA
- WARRIOR PRINCESS
Why don't I like the sound of this?
You're going to a place known the world over as the den for cutthroats, thieves, and mercenaries...
-...and you're not wearing a disguise.
-Don't need a disguise.
They'll remember me.
I think I can use that to my advantage.
And besides, in a strange way, it'll be nice to see some of them again.
You're terrible at reassurance.
Did anyone ever tell you that?
I don't want you to go in there and then decide that you like it again.
It won't happen.
I'm getting in there, getting the girl, getting out.
I did what you said.
I gave out the gold to the poor.
Now what do you need me to do?
You're to stay here and keep me company while we wait.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Have a seat.
Let me tell you a story.
Go on.
You're certain these weapons will be delivered to Beocia immediately.
As soon as my people can produce them.
Kidnap your princess, did they?
Kolonus scum!
You'll get the best of my stock, believe me.
I appreciate your concern over the loss of our sweet princess.
I know what it's like to lose a loved one.
Is the princess here yet?
She was brought in this morning.
Well, tell the emissary from Kolonus that it's half the gold up front.
What do you think, Marcus?
I think you're going to be a rich man.
And Dectus, he cuts him all the way from his neck to his gullet!
He said I grabbed her.
She was asking for it, for Dionysus' sake.
Of course she was.
Oh, yeah, or speaking the language of love, was she, Dectus?
-Yeah, yeah, long live Dionysus.
-Long live who?
-Xena!
You're back!
-What happened to you?
You disappeared then there's this talk all over the place that you've been working for peasants for no profit.
All part of the cause, boys.
All part of the cause.
It's called gaining their trust.
Once you do that...
-That's our Xena!
-...you've got them right where you want them.
There's profit to be made.
-This calls for a drink!
-Yeah, right!
So, all that stuff about fighting for peasants and farmers...
Was Draco's payback for my trouncing him.
Enough already.
And why would you go after Draco?
Because he went after my mother.
You expect us to believe that?
You got something to say to me?
I got something to say about your mother.
How is your mother, Xena?
Marcus, it's been too long!
Come.
So how did you two meet?
I was out for a ride.
In the woods, I bet, on a moonlit night!
No, it was a hot summer day, and no woods.
I was getting a drink from a spring when her reflection suddenly appeared.
I thought it was a water goddess, Panope.
Then, I looked up and I saw it was someone far more beautiful.
She smiled.
From that moment on, I dedicated my life to making that smile appear as often as possible.
That is just too beautiful!
Did you tell her father this?
No.
Really?
You must.
I mean, once he hears the story he's got to believe that you would never have kidnapped her.
-Let's go.
-Gabrielle.
You don't understand.
There's no way I'd ever reach him.
I'll get you in.
I can be very persuasive when I want to be.
Come on!
Where have you been all this time?
I lost track of you after the raid on Semples.
That was a while ago.
I've been keeping busy here and there.
I don't hear much about the great Xena conquests any more.
I don't care much for popularity.
I just came from Lerna.
The king there had a baby I ransomed...
I've missed you, Xena.
I've thought about you a lot.
I've thought about you too, Marcus.
You have?
Yes, many times.
Thoughts of anger, or what we had?
Both.
I heard Beocia's going to war.
I smell profit.
I guess a baby's ransom can't support an army for long.
Not mine.
Dectus!
I'd like some words with you.
What about?
A case full of my new arrows.
A cart full of spears.
They're missing.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Of course not.
I know you stole them!
But I also know you have someone on the inside, working for you.
And the idea that anyone would betray me...
You're scared.
You're afraid of me.
That's good.
And you turned two of my men.
That's smart!
Stop by my office tomorrow, and you got a job Otherwise, get out of Tracus!
Mezentius.
He's my boss.
Did he kidnap the princess?
Let's just say he has all the angles covered.
You are so good.
Just be a moment!
I can't guarantee his mood but usually, he's pretty happy after he's killed someone.
I don't care if he's doing backflips.
I need to talk to him.
Let me give you fair warning, Xena.
This guy could charm the song out of a siren.
As I remember, I wasn't too bad at it myself.
Don't you dare bring that up?
That wasn't charm.
You tricked me!
What trick?
You said you'd do anything for me.
I just called your bluff.
Have her bathed and perfumed and taken to my chambers.
It's just as easy to kill her in the morning.
Mezentius.
Ah, Marcus!
Why didn't you tell me the girl was such a beauty?
I'm gonna have a fine time with her.
Mezentius, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine.
Yes, I know who you are.
And I know why you're here.
Guards!
The great Warrior Princess!
I'm honored.
I saw you at the tavern and I wondered...
"'What would bring Xena here?"
"What do I have that Xena could possibly want?"
The answer was obvious.
Make it more obvious.
Do you think I'm stupid?
You think I haven't heard what you did to Aescalus?
Stole his weapons and ransomed them back to him.
It was brilliant!
I take it you're not so easily fooled.
Not by you.
Not by anyone.
Are you going to kill me?
Kill you?
Far from it.
It's people like you who make people like me.
Then call off your dogs.
Then maybe we can talk business.
Business?
Business, yes.
One hour, in my office.
Marcus, don't let her out of your sight.
So, show me around.
Don't worry, we'll reason with them.
I don't know if he's gonna be in a very reasonable mood.
Listen, a sensitive guy like you would only fall in love with a very special girl.
And anyone who would raise this special girl is probably very special himself, and therefore, reasonable.
It makes sense, doesn't it?
-I think so.
-There.
Who goes there?
Let me handle this.
-Take us to the king.
-Who are you?
My name is Gabrielle.
And this is Agranon...
-...
Prince of Kolonus.
-Get his sword.
-All right, let's go.
-Perfect, we're getting into the castle.
And that's the weapons warehouse where we're assembling the shipment for the Beocian war.
Let me show you one of my favorite places in the compound.
Very nice.
Mezentius discovered this hot spring under his fortress two years ago.
Heats the whole building.
This room has its uses too.
I'll bet.
You look just as beautiful as I remember.
What do you remember?
Everything.
Every sound...
Every touch...
Every smell...
Do you remember?
No!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
I think we better get back to Mezentius.
We can talk about this later.
Mezentius, we had a meeting.
-I'm busy.
It'll wait.
-No, it won't.
We talk now.
I want to make an offer, and I want to give you some advice.
Both are worth a fortune.
Neither comes free.
I never make investments without examining the goods.
I don't intend to start now.
Very well.
Kolonus and Beocia are about to go to war.
Beocia's army is far better.
It'll be over in a month.
Poor Kolonus.
Poor arms dealers.
You'll be winding down before you finished gearing up.
I'm listening.
I can keep the war going indefinitely.
Interesting!
There might be a deal here.
Go on.
I don't care who wins.
My army will fight for one side and then the other.
I'll keep them far busy to figure out that you've got the princess.
She figured that out herself, I didn't tell her that.
I don't need you for that.
The girl will be dead by tomorrow.
Her body found by her family the apparent victim of the Kolonus barbarians.
Your offer is shallow at best.
No deal.
Which brings me to my advice.
The girl's worth far more to you alive.
When the war's over, the victor will pay his treasury to get her back.
Either as a trophy... or a daughter.
Intriguing.
What's all this gonna cost me?
Weapons for my army and half your profits from the war and ransom.
Xena.
Why stop at half?
If you push me, I won't.
I wouldn't dream of it.
Very well, a deal.
Stay away from me!
What's going on?
Up there.
Well, look at this!
Keep away from me, I'm warning you, I'll jump.
Oh, the sheep has fangs!
Good...
This is getting tedious.
-I'll bring her down.
-Wait.
Let me handle this.
Worth more alive, remember?
This Xena is a strange woman.
I like her... energy.
Yes.
I really hope I don't have to kill her.
Stay back!
I'll do it!
-I'll take my own life.
-You're gonna cut your throat and jump?
That's overdoing it a bit, don't you think?
I can still jump.
You can still jump whenever you want.
I'm not going back to that man.
I'm not gonna let him take me.
Neither am I.
Agranon sent me.
You lie.
Come down off the ledge and I'll prove it to you.
There's only one way I'm coming off this ledge and that's straight down.
Does this look familiar?
He did send you.
You're going to be all right.
-Do you know where the grotto is?
-The hot spring?
They took me there to prepare for that awful man.
Meet me there tonight.
When the moon is in the western sky.
Now, go inside.
Can you believe that?
Did I protect our investment, Mezentius?
You protected my property, yes.
Good.
Now don't ruin things by letting your passion overcome your senses.
Your friend can be quite insulting at times.
Perhaps.
But I found it best to listen when Xena speaks.
You found that, did you?
Well...
There's a reason for her success.
She know what she's doing.
Go on.
The princess loses half her ransom value if you go to her.
Now, isn't half a ransom worth a cold bath?
You seem to know a lot about this.
Well, I've dealt with this situation before.
I'll consider your advice.
Oh, and Marcus...
Don't let your passion overcome your senses or your loyalties.
-All clear there?
-Yes.
What's going on, Xena?
What happened to the guard?
I wanted to see what the inventory looked like.
If you wanted to see the weapons, all you had to do was ask me.
Now, tell me the truth.
Faith in the people I work with certainly is in short supply these days.
And what side of the coin do you fall on, Marcus?
Yours, of course.
Know your enemies, Mezentius.
Xena's army will be going up against these weapons.
I thought she should get to know the inventory.
Your weapons are impressive.
Too impressive.
I don't want my men to die needlessly.
That's your problem.
However it might appear to you do not deceive yourself that ours is an equal partnership.
I wouldn't dream of it, Mezentius.
A wise choice.
As long as it's equal pay.
You were going to steal weapons, weren't you?
I'm sure it's not the first time it's ever been done.
No.
In fact, it's still being done.
You just have to know how to juggle the inventory.
How do you get them out of the city?
This is one of four water wells in the city.
Only this one isn't quite what it seems.
A back door right out in the open.
I'm impressed.
You know, I never showed anyone this.
I never trusted anyone.
You know all that talk about you changing trying to leave all this?
-Not you too, Marcus.
-No.
I didn't think you did.
But I tried leaving once.
What happened?
I was in a raiding party.
Some old man was begging us to spare his grandson, who was crippled.
And one of my men said...
"Ok Cut the kid's head off."
You would never kill defenseless people.
I always respected that.
And I never really got it until that day.
So I walked away I thought for good.
Obviously, you came back.
I wasn't cut out for it, pure and simple.
So I said...
"Fine, not for me."
So I came back.
You know, the old Xena would have lopped my head off for a story like that.
The old Xena...
Yeah The old Xena.
You know, there is something different about you now.
I mean, before you were so determined, like you always had something to prove.
But now it's...
But now...?
It's hard to say.
It's like now you have the answer.
But I've never even found the question.
What we have here is a failure to communicate.
No one talks, that's the problem.
When I meet the king, I'll explain that this whole war thing is just a terrible misunderstanding.
We'll get through this, I'm sure of it.
-The key is to meet with him.
-Noon tomorrow.
-To meet the king?
-The executioner.
The war has begun, and you two will be the first casualties.
Oh, Marcus...
I can't do this...
Not now.
Where were you?
I'm here now.
Are you ready?
Let's go.
Who's in there?
Mezentius.
I demand to know who's in there...
Marcus said it would be all right to use the spring.
His timing could've been better.
Or perhaps it couldn't have been better.
I don't usually have an audience.
I'm not an audience.
I'm a business partner and I have something of interest for you.
Please, go ahead.
Well...?
I've just had word that Agranon, the girl's betrothed..., ...has been taken captive by Beocia.
That could be useful.
Are they going to ransom him?
Even better.
They plan to execute him and his companion tomorrow.
This war will be a bloodbath.
Great start, isn't it?
Then I better get ready to fight it after my bath.
Why don't I join you?
The last time I talked business with a handsome man in a hot spring I almost lost a war.
Now, go.
Perhaps another time.
Count on it.
There's no time to lose.
Give me one.
There you go.
Two dinars.
You heard the latest news on Xena?
No, but I'll bet you're gonna tell me.
I talked to a trader who came from Lerna.
He said she was there.
She told me.
She ransomed a baby back to King Gregor, and made a bundle.
What?
Ransomed to the king?
No, no, Marcus She rescued the baby.
She didn't kidnap it.
No.
You got it wrong.
Yeah, I'm sure you wanna believe that.
Is that supposed to mean something?
She's got you fooled, Marcus.
She's running something right now, and you're falling for it like a good, little lovesick puppet.
This guy worked for Nemos, the king's advisor!
She killed Nemos, because he wanted to grab the kid and blackmail the king.
I swear it.
I swear it!
Where's the profit?
I just don't get it.
You'll be shipped out this morning right to your father's encampment.
-I hate little places.
-You'd hate a coffin even more.
Trust me.
Hi.
Oh...
Hi.
What's in the box?
The box?
Some bows, arrows for weight.
Bows and arrows.
Arrows like this?
Of course.
I didn't think you'd seen this arrow yet.
We just developed it.
It'll go through a wood shield like a dagger through butter.
Leave a hole as big as your fist.
Let me show you.
This box will make a good target.
Marcus.
What?
Are you afraid I'm gonna hit the princess?
Please.
I have to save this girl and stop a war.
I couldn't risk telling you.
Especially when I was far more useful being your stooge with Mezentius.
You get a good laugh, Xena?
About your old buddy that couldn't make it on the outside?
It hurt.
I care for you.
You're still a part of me.
Then why the deception?
Why couldn't you just tell me the truth, and ask for my help?
I didn't know how much you cared.
Now I know.
I see it in your eyes.
Come with me now.
How many of us are left from the old days?
Most of them are dead.
Marcus, I don't want to stand by your grave.
You're not better than me, Xena.
You're right.
-What makes you think I want to?
-What made you think you wanted to?
Marcus, it is so simple.
You do one thing, one good thing for no other reason than you know it's right...
That's the first step.
I'm not that strong.
No.
It's too late, Xena.
I'm taking the girl.
Guards!
Come on.
Come on.
Up there!
What is going on?
Marcus...
Somebody find Marcus!
Move!
-You stay here.
-For how long?
As long as it takes.
Get her!
That way.
Get her!
Come on!
After her!
She's getting away!
Get her!
Xena!
Drop the sword!
You're not going to hurt her.
Don't bet on it.
She's no different than the innocent grandchild of that old man.
You're right, Xena.
I'll have my war, if I have to kill every last one of you!
No!
Marcus!
Marcus...
I could have saved her.
I know.
Was that it?
Was that the one step that you meant?
Yeah.
Marcus...
Don't make me stand by your grave.
I wish I could have met him.
I'm sorry.
He was my friend.
To be rememered like that is a good thing.
My friend My friend.

Agranon...
Will you promise me that when we're old, we'll still come back here and sit under these trees ?
When we're old ?
We'll do it every year...
On the anniversary of our wedding day.
And one day, we can bring our grandchildren... lots of grandchildren.
Ten years ago, a marriage between our families would have been impossible.
Does anyone even remember what the feud was about ?
No one in my family remembers.
Whatever it was, it's centuries old, and it ends when we are joined.
We'll definitely bring our grandchildren.
We can tell them that peace was finally made here.
And that one of their parents was made here.
After our wedding, maybe.
That's very strange.
Strange ?
There's somebody out there.
Who is it ?
Who's there ?
Run !
No !
Get your hands off me !
We've got the girl !
Come on !
Agranon, help me !
You see, Xena, the way I look at it, life is an adventure to be explored.
And without adventure, what's the point ?
Granted, with you sometimes it gets a bit too adventurous.
But that's what makes it interesting.
Who was it that said, 'If curiosity is the food of life, then adventure is a meal' ?
Sounds like something you might have said.
Maybe it was me.
Speaking of a meal...
Places like this always have the best food.
And atmosphere...
Two important ingredients to fine dining.
I jest, you know ?
Let's see what's on the menu.
- You whistled ?
- Yeah, wait for me.
Lovely.
Now, this is the salt of the earth.
Well, you gotta admit, the people of Lerna might never appreciate who you are, but King Gregor certainly did.
He would've lost his whole kingdom, if it weren't for you.
Ale, please.
Yep, the baby got a home, Gregor got a son;
Pandora got some rest, and the way you figured out that prophecy, well, I, for one, am still amazed.
OK !
You win !
Did you ever notice that we never have trouble getting a table ?
A mystery to me.
That's if you're for hire.
Hey !
Not that kind of hire, Gabrielle.
Go on.
- May I sit down ?
- No...
Keep talking.
I'm not sure where to begin.
- Who did you want me to kill ?
- No one... unless you have to.
May I please sit down ?
You're new at this, so listen up.
Anyone coming into a place like this, carrying a bag of gold, is looking to live a short life with a messy death.
I don't care.
I've gotta get her back.
Her ?
My fiancee.
She's been abducted, and if she's not returned, there will be a war.
What ?
Who kidnapped her ?
The King of Beocia thinks we did it.
My own father thinks they did it to have an excuse to attack us.
- Nice legs !
- So, who do you think did it ?
Sorry... that happens sometimes...
you were saying ?
I think Jana was taken by someone else... someone whose livelihood would be destroyed if this marriage took place.
Does this someone have a name ?
He's an arms dealer who operates from the walled city of...
Tracus...
I've heard of Mezentius.
I imagine you might have.
Tracus seems to be a crossroads for murderers and mercenaries.
No offense taken.
Sorry.
You must help us.
We're talking about two nations going to war !
I don't work for nations.
I don't work for money.
and I won't work for you.
Please !
Please, you're right.
I don't know what I'm doing.
All I know is the woman that I love more than my own breath, my Jana, I love her, and I will die for her if I have to.
Ask anything of me... and it's yours.
First, there are hungry people in this town who could use that gold.
I'll take this.
And you'll get your Jana back.
Thank you.
Can I see ?
Give me that !
In a time of ancient gods warlords and kings...
A land in turmoil cried out for a hero...
She was Xena... a mighty princess, forged in the heat of battle The power The passion The danger...
Her courage will change the world...
Why don't I like the sound of this ?
You're going to a place known the world over, as, the den for cutthroats, thieves, a nd mercenaries,
- and, you're not wearing a disguise.
- Don't need a disguise.
They'll remember me.
I think I can use that to my advantage.
And besides, in a strange way, it'll be nice to see some of them again.
You're terrible at reassurance...
did anyone ever tell you that ?
I don't want you to go in there and then...
decide that you like it again.
It won't happen...
I'm getting in there, getting the girl, getting out.
I did what you said.
I gave out the gold to the poor.
Now what do you need me to do ?
You're to stay here and keep me company, while we wait.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Have a seat.
Let me tell you a story.
Go on.
You're certain these weapons will be delivered to Beocia immediately.
As soon as my people can produce them.
Kidnap your Princess, did they ?
Kolonus scum !
You'll get the best of my stock, believe me.
I appreciate your concern over the loss of our sweet princess.
I know what it's like to lose a loved one.
Is the Princess here yet ?
She was brought in this morning.
Well, tell the emissary from Kolonus, that it's half the gold up front.
What do you think, Marcus ?
I think you're going to be a rich man.
And Dectus, he cuts him all the way from his neck to his gullet !
He said I grabbed her.
She was asking for it, for Dionysus' sake.
Of course she was.
Oh, yeah, or speaking the language of love, was she, Dectus ?
- Yeah, yeah...
Long live Dionysus !
- Long live who ?
- Xena !
You're back !
- What happened to you ?
You disappeared, then there's this talk all over the place that you've been working for peasants for no profit.
All part of the cause, boys.
All part of the cause.
It's called gaining their trust.
Once you do that,
you've got them right where you want them.
There's profit to be made.
- This calls for a drink !
- Yeah, right !
So, all that stuff about fighting for peasants and farmers-
Was Draco's payback for my trouncing him.
Enough, already.
And why would you go after Draco ?
Because he went after my mother.
You expect us to believe that ?
You got something to say to me ?
I got something to say about your mother...
How is your mother, Xena ?
Marcus, it's been too long !
Come.
So how did you two meet ?
I was out for a ride.
In the woods, I bet, on a moonlit night.
No...
It was a hot summer day, and no woods.
I was getting a drink from a spring, when her reflection suddenly appeared.
I thought it was a water goddess, Panope.
Then, I looked up, and I saw it was someone far more beautiful.
She smiled.
From that moment on, I dedicated my life to making that smile appear as often as possible.
That is just too beautiful.
Did you tell her father this ?
No.
Really ?
You must.
I mean, once he hears the story, he's got to believe that you would never have kidnapped her.
- Let's go.
- Gabrielle.
You don't understand.
There's no way I'd ever reach him.
I'll get you in.
I can be very persuasive when I want to be.
Come on !
Where have you been all this time ?
I lost track of you after the raid on Semplese.
That was a while ago.
I've been keeping busy, here and there.
I don't hear much about the great Xena conquests any more.
I don't care much for popularity.
I just came from Lerna...
the king there had a baby I ransomed.
I've missed you, Xena.
I've thought about you a lot.
I've thought about you too, Marcus.
You have ?
Yes, many times.
Thoughts of anger, or, what we had ?
Both.
I heard Beocia's going to war.
I smell profit.
I guess a baby's ransom can't support an army for long.
Not mine.
Dectus !
I'd like some words with you.
What about ?
A case full of my new arrows.
A cart full of spears.
They're missing.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Of course not.
I know you stole them.
But I also know you have someone on the inside, working for you.
And the idea that anyone would betray me...
You're scared, you're afraid of me.
That's good.
And you turned two of my men.
That's smart.
Stop by my office tomorrow, and you got a job, otherwise, get out of Tracus.
Mezentius.
He's my boss.
Did he kidnap the Princess ?
let's just say he has all the angles covered.
You are so good.
Just be a moment !
I can't guarantee his mood, but usually, he's pretty happy after he's killed someone.
I don't care if he's doing backflips.
I need to talk to him.
Let me give you fair warning, Xena.
This guy could charm the song out of a siren.
As I remember, I wasn't too bad at it myself.
Don't you dare bring that up ?
That wasn't charm.
You tricked me.
What trick ?
You said you'd do anything for me.
I just called your bluff.
Have her bathed and perfumed and taken to my chambers !
It's just as easy to kill her in the morning.
Mezentius.
Ah, Marcus.
Why didn't you tell me the girl was such a beauty ?
I'm gonna have a fine time with her.
Mezentius, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine.
Yes, I know who you are.
And, I know why you're here.
Guards !
The great Warrior Princess.
I'm honored.
I saw you at the tavern, and I wondered, 'What would bring Xena here ?
What do I have that Xena could possibly want ?
'
The answer was obvious.
Make it more obvious.
Do you think I'm stupid ?
You think I haven't heard what you did to Aescalus ?
Stole his weapons and ransomed them back to him.
It was brilliant !
I take it you're not so easily fooled.
Not by you.
Not by anyone.
Are you going to kill me ?
Kill you ?
Far from it.
It's people like you who make people like me.
Then call off your dogs.
Then, maybe we can talk business.
Business ?
Business, yes.
One hour, in my office.
Marcus, don't let her out of your sight.
So, show me around.
Don't worry, we'll reason with them.
I don't know if he's gonna be in a very reasonable mood.
Listen.
A sensitive guy like you would only fall in love with a very special girl.
And anyone who would raise this special girl is probably very special himself, and therefore, reasonable.
It makes sense, doesn't it ?
- I think so.
- Who goes there ?
Let me handle this.
- Take us to the king.
- Who are you ?
My name is Gabrielle.
And this is Agranon,
- Prince of Kolonus.
- Get his sword.
- All right, let's go.
- Perfect... we're getting into the castle.
And that's the weapons warehouse, where we're assembling the shipment for the Beocian war.
Let me show you one of my favorite places in the compound.
Very nice.
Mezentius discovered this hot spring under his fortress two years ago.
Heats the whole building.
This room has its uses, too.
I'll bet.
You look just as beautiful as I remember.
What do you remember ?
Everything.
Every sound, every touch,
every smell.
Do you remember ?
No !
Leave me alone !
Leave me alone !
I think we better get back to Mezentius.
We can talk about this later.
Mezentius, we had a meeting.
- I'm busy, it'll wait.
- No it won't... we talk now.
I want to make an offer, and I want to give you some advice.
Both are worth a fortune.
Neither comes free.
I never make investments without examining the goods.
I don't intend to start now.
Very well.
Kolonus and Beocia are about to go to war.
Beocia's army is far better.
It'll be over in a month.
Poor Kolonus.
Poor arms dealers.
You'll be winding down before you finished gearing up.
I'm listening.
I can keep the war going indefinitely.
Interesting.
There might be a deal here.
Go on.
I don't care who wins.
My army will fight for one side, and then the other.
I'll keep them far busy to figure out that you've got the princess.
She figured that out herself, I didn't tell her that.
I don't need you for that.
The girl will be dead by tomorrow... her body found by her family, the apparent victim of the Kolonus barbarians.
Your offer is shallow at best...
No deal.
Which brings me to my advice.
The girl's worth far more to you alive.
When the war's over, the victor will pay his treasury to get her back... either as a trophy or a daughter.
Intriguing.
What's all this gonna cost me ?
Weapons for my army and half your profits, from the war and ransom.
Why stop at half ?
Well if you push me, I won't.
I wouldn't dream of it.
Very well, a deal.
Stay away from me !
What's going on ?
Up there.
Well, look at this.
Keep away from me, I'm warning you...
I'll jump.
Oh !
The sheep has fangs.
Good.
This is getting tedious.
- I'll bring her down.
- Wait.
Let me handle this.
Worth more alive, remember ?
This Xena is a strange woman.
I like her... energy.
Yes.
I really hope I don't have to kill her.
Stay back !
I'll do it.
- I'll take my own life.
- You're gonna cut your throat and jump.
That's overdoing it a bit, don't you think ?
I can still jump.
You can still jump whenever you want.
I'm not going back to that man.
I'm not gonna let him take me.
Neither am I.
Agranon sent me.
You lie.
Come down off the ledge, and I'll prove it to you.
There's only one way I'm coming off this ledge, and that's straight down.
Does this look familiar ?
He did send you.
You're going to be all right.
- Do you know where the grotto is ?
- The hot spring ?
They took me there to prepare for that awful man.
Meet me there tonight...
When the moon is in the western sky.
Now, go inside.
Can you believe that ?
Did I protect our investment, Mezentius ?
You protected my property, yes.
Good.
Now don't ruin things by letting your passion overcome your senses.
Your friend can be quite insulting at times.
Perhaps.
But I found it best to listen when Xena speaks.
Oh, you found that, did you ?
Well, there's a reason for her success.
She know what she's doing.
Go on.
The princess loses half her ransom value if you go to her.
Now, isn't half a ransom worth a cold bath ?
You seem to know a lot about this.
Well, I've dealt with this situation before.
I'll consider your advice.
Oh, and Marcus, don't let your passion overcome your senses... or your loyalties.
- All clear there ?
- Yes.
What's going on, Xena ?
What happened to the guard ?
I wanted to see what the inventory looked like.
If you wanted to see the weapons, all you had to do was ask me.
Now, tell me the truth.
Faith in the people I work with certainly is in short supply these days.
And what side of the coin do you fall on, Marcus ?
Yours, of course.
Know your enemies, Mezentius.
Xena's army will be going up against these weapons.
I thought she should get to know the inventory.
Your weapons are impressive... too impressive.
I don't want my men to die needlessly.
That's your problem.
However it might appear to you, do not deceive yourself that ours is an equal partnership.
I wouldn't dream of it, Mezentius.
A wise choice.
As long as it's equal pay.
You were going to steal weapons, weren't you ?
I'm sure it's not the first time it's ever been done.
No...
In fact, it's still being done.
You just have to know how to... juggle the inventory.
How do you get them out of the city ?
This is one of four water wells in the city.
Only this one isn't quite what it seems.
A back door right out in the open.
I'm impressed.
You know, I never showed anyone this.
I never trusted anyone.
You know all that talk about you changing... trying to leave all this ?
- Not you too, Marcus.
- No, I didn't think you did.
But I tried leaving once.
What happened ?
I was in a raiding party.
Some old man was begging us to spare his grandson, who was crippled.
And one of my men said, 'OK, cut the kid's head off. '
You would never kill defenseless people.
I always respected that.
And I never really got it until that day.
So I walked away...
I thought for good.
Obviously, you came back.
I wasn't cut out for it, pure and simple.
So I said, fine, not for me.
So I came back.
You know, the old Xena would have lopped my head off for a story like that.
The old Xena.
Yeah, the old Xena.
You know, there is something different about you now.
I mean, before, you... were so determined, like you... always had something to prove.
But now, it's...
But now...
It's hard to say.
It's like, now, you have the answer.
But I've never even found the question.
What we have here is a failure to communicate.
No one talks...
that's the problem.
When I meet the king, I'll explain that... this whole war thing is just a terrible misunderstanding.
We'll get through this, I'm sure of it.
- The key is to meet with him.
- Noon, tomorrow.
- To meet the king ?
- The executioner.
The war has begun, and you two will be the first casualties.
Oh, Marcus, I can't do this.
Look, not now.
Where were you ?
I'm here now.
Are you ready ?
Let's go.
Who's in there ?
Mezentius.
I demand to know who's in there !
Marcus said it would be all right to use the spring.
His timing could've been better.
Or, perhaps, it couldn't have been better.
I don't usually have an audience.
I'm not an audience.
I'm a business partner, and I have something of interest for you.
Please, go ahead.
Well ?
I've just had word that Agranon, the girl's betrothed, has been taken captive by Beocia.
That could be useful.
Are they going to ransom him ?
Even better.
They plan to execute him and his companion tomorrow.
This war will be a bloodbath.
Great start, isn't it ?
Then I better get ready to fight it, after my bath.
Why don't I join you ?
The last time I talked business with a handsome man in a hot spring,
I almost lost a war.
Now, go.
Perhaps another time.
Count on it.
There's no time to lose.
Give me one.
There you go.
Two dinars.
You heard the latest news on Xena ?
No, but I'll bet you're gonna tell me.
I talked to a trader who came from Lerna.
He said she was there.
She told me.
She ransomed a baby back to King Gregor, and made a bundle.
What ?
Ransomed to the King ?
No, no, Marcus, she rescued the baby...
She didn't kidnap it.
No.
You got it wrong.
Yeah, I'm sure you wanna believe that.
Is that supposed to mean something ?
She's got you fooled, Marcus.
She's running something right now, and you're falling for it like a good, little lovesick puppet.
This guy worked for Nemos, the king's advisor.
She killed Nemos, because he wanted to grab the kid and blackmail the king.
I swear it !
I swear it !
Where's the profit ?
I just don't get it.
You'll be shipped out this morning, right to your father's encampment.
- I hate little places.
- You'd hate a coffin even more.
Trust me.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
What's in the box ?
The box ?
Some bows, arrows for weight.
Bows and arrows.
Arrows like this ?
Of course.
I didn't think you'd seen this arrow yet.
We just developed it.
It'll go through a wood shield like a dagger through butter.
Leave a hole as big as your fist.
Let me show you.
Ah, this box will make a good target.
Marcus.
What ?
Are you afraid I'm gonna hit the princess ?
Please.
I have to save this girl and stop a war.
I couldn't risk telling you.
Especially, when I was far more useful being your stooge with Mezentius.
You get a good laugh, Xena ?
About your old buddy that couldn't make it on the outside ?

you're still a part of me.
Then, why the deception ?
Why couldn't you just tell me the truth, and ask for my help ?
I didn't know how much you cared.
Now, I know.
I see it in your eyes.
Come with me, now.
How many of us are left from the old days ?
Most of them are dead.
Marcus, I don't want to stand by your grave.
You're not better than me, Xena.
You're right.
- What makes you think I want to ?
- What made you think you wanted to ?
Marcus, it is so simple.
You do one thing, one good thing, for no other reason than you know it's right.
That's the first step.
I'm not that strong...
No...
It's too late, Xena.
I'm taking the girl.
Guards !
Come on.
Come on.
Up there !
What is going on ?
Marcus.
Somebody find Marcus !
Move !
- You stay here.
- For how long ?
As long as it takes.
- Get her !
- That way.
- Get her !
- Come on !
- After her !
- Get her !
Drop the sword !
You're not going to hurt her.
Don't bet on it.
She's no different than the innocent grandchild of that old man.
You're right, Xena.
I'll have my war, if I have to kill every last one of you !
No !
Marcus !
I could have saved her.
I know...
Was that it ?
Was that the one step that you meant ?
Yeah.
Marcus, don't make me stand by your grave.
I wish I could have met him.
I'm sorry.
He was my friend.
To be rememered like that is a good thing.
My friend,
my friend.
This little seance isn't going to freak you girls out.
- Nah, I think it's cool.
- I like to be scared.
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on.
Good answer because Wyatt's house is really haunted.
- Yeah, right.
- It's te.
You've got your occasional chair stacking, floating beds
- walls that sweat blood.
- You, uh, learn to live with it.
Wy, you want to bring out our surprise guest?
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the Great Madam Bongovich!
[ clapping ]
The spirits, they are restless.
Many are eager to cross over.
Who do you wish me to contact?
[ screaming ]
[ eerie howling and screaming ]
There's a chance this was a bad idea.
I sense an evil presence has joined us.
I can smell the stink of its foul putrid flesh.
Speak, o stinky one!
- Bite me.
- [ screaming ] [ laughing ]
Get lost, Chett.
This is a serious seance.
Sure, you gutless wienie.
All you have to do is wrap a towel around your head and talk to a paperweight
- and hell reaches out to grab you.
- I'd be careful with that.
Cut it out.
That's dangerous.
Too bad it ain't a real crystal ball.
It could show me a member of my family with some real huevos.
Uh-oh.
- What the hell...?
- [ wailing ]
- [ snorting ] - [ all screaming ]
See you guys.
- Thanks for coming.
- [ door closes ]
What's going on?
Who's the big freak upstairs?
Chett wanted to meet someone in his family.
The crystal ball must have opened up a hole in time and sucked the big guy through.
If I'm reading this right, his name is Baldash and he's from way down... here.
12 century.
One of the first Donnellys in the clan.
We left Chett alone with him.
He could be in serious danger.
The varmint's own skin made us a grand sail.
We sewed it together hoisted it up and were carried all the way back to the home port by the breeze.
That... is the coolest.
I don't know how you got here or why.
I hope you can stick around.
- What's going on?
- You must be Wyatt.
I was just telling the tale of how we bested our enemies
- off the Coast of Gaul.
- Tell me another one, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great Uncle Baldash.
You come from a mighty line of warriors, cousins.
The Donnellys are a proud and noble family.
We fight for what is right and we twist the limbs of
- our enemies like twigs from a tree!
- All right.
But...
I've talked too much.
Tell me, how does a Donnelly from the 20th Century amuse
- himself between bloody battles?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Ha.
- Thanks a lot, Madam Bongovich.
- I didn't invite him.
Chett did.
Besides, he's your lunatic relative.
I thank you for the costume.
I believe it has aided in my scamming for babes.
Yeah, it's "No shirt, no service" in here.
Aw!
There are so few pleasures of the flesh in your time.
No, it's okay.
We have TV now.
BALDASH:
A device that brings women into your house?
- Now, that is magic.
- Well, they're not real.
- They're... pictures.
- Pictures?
But only cowards and those with weeping sores must do without the company of real women.
Yeah.
You said that.
Yeah, this black soup makes me feel like I could lay siege to a hundred castles right now!
Mochachinos are a head trip, aren't they?
A brave heart and a full bladder is a strange combination indeed.
But come, let us see more of this world.
We have many adventures before we sleep.
[ Baldash yelling ]
Here's one for you.
Aye.
Ahh...
Aye.
So, when do I call out the word "shotgun"?
Before I have drunken the ale or after?
Doesn't matter.
Either way you get pretty buzzed.
Oy, you're breaking her.
Get out of here.
Grab the pig.
He's a poor pisser.
- Prepare to meet your maker, Knave.
- Make my day, cheese-ball.
I'll make it your last, you dog-earred ruffian!
Skanky, buttheaded stink-wad!
Unmuzzled, bunchbacked maltworm!
- Scuzzbucket!
- Hedepig!
Sewer-sucking, fatheaded, momma-loving pus bag!
[ yelling ]
You're quite the wordsmith.
'Tis a family trait, you know.
They say a Donnelly's insult wounds like a dagger to the heart.
Hey, you big jerks.
- Mom always said he was adopted.
- [ boisterous laughter ]
You're both hee-laous.
Maybe it's okay to smash mailboxes trample flower gardens and spray-paint house pets in the 12th Century, but it happens to be illegal now.
Master Wyatt, I am teaching your brother the ways of your ancestors.
Would you not like to learn to be a warrior as well?
Thanks.
I'll pass.
Perhaps you're better suited to be a monk my soft-skinned fellow.
- A what?
- A monk.
One who fears battle and has a knowledge of books
- and letters and takes a vow of celibacy.
- Bingo.
It's time to lay waste to the neighboring castles.
Show me again your weapon of choice.
We call it TP and it inflicts great humiliation on its victims.
Most excelle.
Should we not dip it in oil and set it aflame as well?
Well, I tried that once and the Pattersons really freaked out.
[ boisterous laughter ]
I'm not a monk!
I go on plenty of dates and I'd like to see you play me at risk.
Then we'll see who the Ruthless Tyrant is.
Ha!
My brother is bonding with attila the hun.
Sounds like someone's jealous.
Maybe.
I've known Chett all my life and I've never gotten along with him half as well as Baldash.
He's a fun guy once you get past that wet-dog smell.
- You might learn something from him.
- Yeah.
Why not go forth and frolic your brains out just for kicks?
All right.
He can stay tonight but no more neighborhood rampages.
We're staying I. Maybe rent a movie.
A nice, quiet evening at home.
Dance contest!
[ "You Never Can Tell" by Chuck Berry playing ]
Guys, look!
Hygelac!
What brings you here?
My Lord, you must return to Donnelly Castle.
Grondin and his men are preparing to attack.
- How close are they to the gates?
- [ hiccups ]
Pretty close.
I must go at once.
Wait.
I'm going with you.
That would make me proud.
Oh, give me a break.
As usual, you have no clue what you're getting yourself into.
Yeah, and as usual, you're a wimp when it comes to doing your duty.
What do I owe some 500-years-old guy with bad breath?
He's your family.
You may not think
Uncle Baldash has good manners but he made this family.
He cares about the Donnelly name and he'll fight to defend it.
Will you?
I didn't think so.
Come.
Time is short.
I'm out of here, bro.
Duty.
Soon the cursed armies of Grondin will be upon us.
So take up your swords fix the look of death in your eyes
- and the taste of blood upon your tongue!
- [ cheering ]
Tie up your boots.
You don't want to trip.
My heart sings, Chett at the thought of you and I marching into battle side by side.
- You give me great pride.
- Thanks, Uncle B.
I can't wait to use some of those moves you taught me.
Hey, guys.
Look at me!
I'm a princess.
Trapped in the tower by an awful king and his handsome knight.
- Who will save me?
- What is this, a monk costume?
- I'm a monk?
!
- I think "Friar Wyatt" has a nice ring to it.
I wouldn't talk-- fool.
There's Chett.
There's an extra mattress in the wine cellar.
What do you say, Wench?
Me and you?
I say, call me when you get out of charm school, pig.
And I'm not a wench.
I'm a princess.
Wyatt.
You've come to fight?
- I came to bring Chett home.
- What are you, my mommie?
- Forget it.
I'm staying.
- You can't.
- If you stay, you'll die.
- Hey, I belong here, okay?
With real men.
Manly men.
Men who know the art of warfare.
Men who aren't afraid to die a slow and painful death
- at the end of bloody sword!
- [ grumbling ]
He's just excited, lads.
Don't pay him any mind.
You're not a medieval knight, Chett.
You're a slacker who lives with his parents and reads highlights magazine.
Now, come on.
Let's go.
Forget it.
- Baldash.
- Grondin, my old friend.
I will be a special pleasure tose your head on the end of my blade.
[ laughing ]
Just like a Donnelly to bray like an ass.
I'll show you what a Donnelly's capable of you scurvy little tick!
- Do your worst.
- Do the death!
Right?
Aye, very good.
- Do the death!
- Do the death!
[ yelling ]
This is insane.
They'll kill each other.
Here's an idea--
Let's get the hell out.
[ laughing ]
- Sing me a song, fool.
- Take a hike, fatso.
- I said I'd like a song.
- A song it is.
I got to stop this.
Everyone!
Throw down your weapon!
- No one is going to fight!
- Out of the way, monk.
- This is not your place, Wyatt.
- No!
You guys are about to slaughter each other and for no reason.
- It's stupid.
We have our reason.
- That's right.
This Ballbag's father brought forth his armies to wipe out the forbearers of the Donnelly clan.
After your family conquered the field of Aubergone.
Really?
Yes.
I've always wanted to but I was unable.
- Allergies.
- Aw... but somebody did!
- You must pay the price!
- Kill 'em all!
No!
Stop!
Geeze.
Try to evolve a little, will you?
Now!
We were on to something here.
Let's just keep talking.
Grondin, you go first.
- What do you remember exactly?
- Well, my grandfather told me about a man who used to make cheese in his village and I believe that was somewhere near the poppy fields of Norwich.
If I'm correct.
Yes!
I remember now.
I had sinus trouble at summer.
So, basically... you're upset because some guy a million years ago who might be related to him took a whiz in some creek that ran through land you may or may not have owned?
Well... yes.
But legend has it that the creek turned an emerald green and stank most foul for days.
I must admit my people were quite fond of asparagus.
See, if you just sit down and open an honest dialogue no one has to die.
- Then we marched here for nothing?
- Exactly.
That's no fun.
MAN:
Why don't you fight each other to the death?
- Who dares speak out of turn?
!
- Bring him forward!
We'll kill him.
Why don't you each pick a warrior to fight for you?
Your lives will be spared and you'll still get a decent fight.
There's wisdom in his words.
Great wisdom indeed.
When this hour is up we'll make our choice.
Talk amongst yourselves.
You bonehead.
They were making peace!
Forgive me for being a Al Donnelly, okay?
I don't "share my feelings" to solve every problem.
- I fight for what I believe in.
- What are you doing?
I'm getting ready.
Uncle Baldash to going to pick me.
- He said that?
- He'll pick me.
- So, dost thou cometh here often?
- You're kidding me, right?
Why wouldst I kiddeth thou?
One so lovely and fair,
- much like a princess.
- A princess?
- You really think so?
- I speaketh the truth.
Say, wouldst thou care to see the holy grail?
Get out of here.
You have the holy grail?
- The holy grail?
- Come.
Allow me to escort thee to my chamber of wonders.
# 88 bottles of beer on the wall # # 88 bottles of beer #
# One of those bottles should happen to fall... #
- Uh... 16?
- Close enough.
# 16 bottles of beer on the wall. #
The time has come.
Grondin, make your choice.
My designated warrior shall be...
Hemet.
Very well.
My designated warrior shall be...
- I'm going to get medieval on his ass.
- Don't do it.
You're going to be his lunch.
Wyatt!
What?
!
I'll be with you in just a sec.
What are you thinking?
He's a building with shoes!
I'll fight him.
I'll do it.
No.
No, Chett, my word is law.
Wyatt shall have the honor of defending the Donnelly name.
Might as well change the Donnelly name to "Dog Meat."
Enough talk!
Fight!
[ screaming ] [ yelling ]
I'm out of here.
- Why did you pick him over me?
- Have faith, Chett.
I feel the warrior within him will soon awaken.
[ yelling ]
- Lisa, help!
Lisa!
- I could be wrong.
Hey, what are you trying to pull?
This is no holy grail.
So... sueth me.
The important thing is, here we are, all alone.
Perhaps thou wouldst desire to lay with me upon yonder cot and sire a young...
That's no way to treat a princess.
- Get him, Wyatt!
Get him!
- Coward.
He truly is a Donnelly.
Okay.
Now I'm getting nervous.
Hey, Hemet!
You hear about the guy with a duck on his head?
The doctor says, "Can I help you?"
The duck says, "Yeah, get this guy off my ass."
[ laughing ] [ choking ]
Or the two peanuts walking down the street?
One of them was assaulted.
Get it? "A salted"?
[ choking ]
Finish him off.
[ gasping ]
[ roaring ]
Hang on, Wy-
- I'm coming!
Victory is ours!
[ cheering ]
Don't let the gate hit you on the way out.
- We'll be back.
- And the Donnellys will be waiting!
Wyatt.
You've shown me cunnings of a different nature.
You make me proud to be a Donnelly.
Come!
Let us partake of wine and goats!
You done good, bro.
I didn't think you could do it.
- You made me proud.
- Thanks.
You too.
- So, care to help me gut a goat?
- Sure.
- But I get the entrails.
- You always get the entrails.
# Here's a story #
# 'Bout a man named Brady #
# Who was living with three boys of his own #
# They were four men living all together #
# And they were all alone #
# Ba-da ba-da bum-bum. # [ laughing ] You're very good.
Captioned by Grant Brown
Okay, I understand, but could you please take a message for Joe?
Who is this?
Is Tiny around?
Well, can I speak to him?
You know what?
Never mind.
Thanks for nothing.
Bad phone etiquette at the jock house?
Either that or Joe's avoiding me.
Don, it's homecoming week.
It's got to be, you know, like a totally insane time for Joe with the game on Saturday and everything.
Yeah, I know.
But he made me promise to call him before I left for the Tournament House.
Well, I wouldn't make too much out of it.
It's been a weird week.
That's for sure.
On a more positive note, we haven't had a Ray Pruit sighting in days.
You're not calling again, are you?
I can't help it.
Ti-Tiny?
Hi, it's Donna.
Is Joe around?
Uh, just a second.
A.K., it's Joe's girlfriend.
This is A.K.
Hey, what's going on?
He's talking with the police.
Some guy's claming Joe pounded on him Halloween night.
On Halloween?
Oh, no.
I'll tell him you called.
I got to go.
Damn him.
Joe?
Ray.
He's not giving up.
Give me some room here, guys.
May I have your attention, please?
Listen up, Condor maniacs!
Thanks, Muntz.
A lot of you may already know me.
But for those of you who don't, I'm Steve Sanders.
I've been appointed the guardian over the Condor, Cornelius J. Condor.
I want you all to know that when our warriors take that field against those cross-town unmentionables... that Corny will be there!
Corny will be there as he is every year to watch over our warriors to ensure a victory.
- Victory!
- Victory!
Guarding Corny is no easy task.
As I speak, there are S.C.U. students conspiring to snatch him.
Uh-huh.
That's not gonna happen on my watch, folks.
At 3:00 today, Corny's gonna be crated up and transported to a secret location known only to my covert Condor patrol.
So until Saturday, let the demons of generosity be with us.
Yeah!
Our Corny...
S.C.U. will definitely be out for revenge.
Last year, a bunch of us got together and we stole their stuffed bear.
Yeah, spy versus spy.
Sounds like fun.
It is.
You know, you're part of C.U. now, Professor Robbins.
Maybe you should join the ranks.
Well, I'd only do it if you were doing it.
Well, I've already done it, sorry.
See you later.
Bye.
How'd I do, our man?
Like they say, sounds like school spirit.
Well, thanks a lot.
Hey, Silver, where's Valerie?
She was the chief architect in the great bear heist, and she's missing all this?
Beats me.
Could've sworn she'd be here.
I'm sorry.
I got here a little early, Valerie.
All right, Jonesy, what are you doing here?
Remember that favor I did for you and Dylan in old Mexico?
It's payback time.
- Yeah, yeah, right.
- Do you mind?
No, no, not at all.
So, uh... how's detective life?
Well, it's booming.
So, uh, did you hear about Dylan?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I got a, uh, blow by blow from a bud at the Bureau.
But, uh, you know, what the hell, I wish him luck.
Yeah, we all do.
Wherever he is.
You know, I could find him if you want me to.
I don't think he wants to be found.
That's good, because, uh, that's not the reason why I'm here.
You're calling in my promise.
You know, that's what I love about you.
You can dance, Valerie, you can dance to any tune.
Listen, Jonesy, just break it down for me first, okay?
I'm not the same girl I was in Mexico.
Well, I don't know about that.
I mean, from where I'm sitting, you are definitely, uh, topping out the old, uh, scorch meter.
- Whoosh!
- You were saying?
Okay, uh, this gig is like cotton candy compared to Mexico.
I need you for one night, okay?
You don't have to leave town.
And I'll tell you what, I'll throw in a very tasteful wardrobe, okay?
You owe me.
Say yes?
Come on, who's your buddy?
Who's your buddy?
Yes?
Okay, yes.
Yes!
What's going on?
I might be charged with battery for that, uh, that fight with Ray.
I'm sorry.
I had to tell Coach, and, uh, that's when he realized that I must have missed curfew Halloween night.
He checked and found out someone else had signed in for me.
And, uh, he suspended me for one game.
Yeah, but if you hadn't been there,
I don't know what would have happened to me.
Doesn't matter now.
Sports radio's suddenly reporting S.C.U.
as a heavy favorite.
This dorm is not exactly the happiest place on Earth.
Joe.
Coach said to stay away from her.
You want him to sit you out for another game?
I have to go, Donna.
I know.
Do us all a favor:
go away.
And I'll tell you what,
I'll throw in a very tasteful wardrobe, okay?
Dylan, this is Fran Irving from Lahaina Bay Realty.
Thursday.
I'm dying to show you the most fabulous piece of beachfront, but you have to call me.
808-555-0141.
Aloha.
Brandon.
I know.
I said I'd only be a second.
Well, I wouldn't care, but if I start showing up late to the staff meetings, everybody else will, too.
Sorry.
Do you know exactly what "close up the place" means?
Because it just seems kind of vague to me, and I don't know exactly where to start.
If you want to stay here, you should.
Just let me take your car, okay?
You want to take my car?
Sure.
Why?
No, that's all right.
Let's go.
Look, I know this hasn't been getting any easier for you.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah, you can cheer me up.
Well, I know something you can do.
- What's that?
- Well, you haven't written a column yet this week.
Maybe that might help you back in the swing of things.
Is that a hint, Ms. Editor?
Of course not.
Now the moment you've been waiting for.
The announcement of the seven ladies who will comprise the Royal Court.
Princess three, number 119, Cara Gannon.
Number 381, Tiffany Ramos.
It's about time.
The freeway was shut down to one lane.
Princess four, number 400, Virginia Vanover.
Donna's gonna have a fit when she sees that her mom's here.
Typical Felice.
Show up for the glory.
Hmm, not exactly.
She's probably here to gloat when Donna loses.
Mm-hmm.
Princess five, number 132, Lisa Dixon.
Number six, number 512, Neda Shokrian.
I still can't believe she got this far.
And princess seven, number 675, Donna Martin.
Well, it looks like you're going to have to tell her now.
There I am.
It is you.
I knew it was you.
Why would you lie to me?
The day after this picture was taken,
I found out I was pregnant.
What?
I was 19 years old, living at home with my parents.
Your father was in medical school.
We had to get married as quickly as we could.
I never told anyone.
Not my parents, not even my best friend.
And then, of course, I had to drop out of the competition because the tournament has rules about married girls participating.
That was 26 years ago.
What happened to the baby?
I had a miscarriage.
Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry.
No, Donna, I'm the one who's sorry.
I wanted you to quit, too.
I didn't want you to find out what a fraud your mother is.
No, you're not a fraud.
Yes, I am.
I mean, how could I preach virginity when here I was, even younger than you, engaging in free love?
What kind of a life lesson is that?
I love the lessons you've taught me.
They're the best lessons.
You don't think I'm a hypocrite?
You'd only be that if you hadn't told me the truth.
I love you so much.
I only want the very best for you.
I hope you believe that.
I do.
I love you, too, Mom.
Come on, come on.
Where do we put it?
Put it in the foyer.
You're gonna put it in there?
Why don't you just put a big sign on it that says C.U. Mascot?
By the way, it's "foy-yea."
"Foy-yea," whatever.
Listen.
Why don't you just chill and take orders, okay?
Well, if it isn't the deserter.
Valerie, where the hell have you been?
You're missing all the action.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to flake, but something came up.
Can you guys get by this year without me?
You hear that, Corny?
Valerie's deserting us.
What should I...?
Oh.
What did he say?
He said, Valerie who?
He's a fickle bird.
You guys thirsty?
- There's some beer in the fridge.
- All righty.
So, uh, you okay?
No.
Uh, something came up.
Oh, well, if it has anything to do with the club,
I'll give you a hand.
No, actually, it's personal.
Um, I'm going to have to go out later.
It's no big deal.
Do you need a ride?
No, I have to finish up some business.
Alone.
What kind of business?
Old business.
Now are you going to give me the third degree, or are you going to kiss me?
No, I'm going to give you the third degree.
I can't imagine what's so important.
Fine.
I thought you'd understand.
Understand what?
You won't even tell me what's going on.
Look, David, could I have my personal life, please?
I mean, do I have to tell you everything?
Sorry.
Hi.
Come on in the car.
So, you ready to rock and stroll, Valerie?
I'm not getting out of the car.
Of course you are.
Look, this guy likes to, uh, pick them up from the streets, all right?
That's how he gets his little rush.
Come on, here we go.
Come on.
Aah...
Step lightly, me little lassie.
Uh...
Well, um, you know what I want you to do, right?
Forget it.
I am not gonna parade around and shake my little moneymaker,
- okay?
- Oh, no, no, no.
Of course you're not.
I mean, these girls are, uh, they're too obvious.
What, what this guy wants, you know, is, uh, some attitude, right?
So, you just kind of snuggle up to the old Cadillac here, show a little.
And you look like you are P.O.'d at somebody, all right?
Great.
I can do that.
Listen, Valerie,
I got your back all the way on this, all right?
Now, with any kind of luck, this white limo's gonna be cruising by within the hour.
Look, you know me, I've done my homework.
Why?
Because I'm a total professional.
Wait, I have to get in the car with him?
Yeah.
No way!
No!
No way!
Valerie, Valerie, no, no, no, listen, listen, listen, okay?
The driver...
he's working with us.
He's gonna take you to the Bel Ami Hotel, because, uh, fun boy likes to impress the trash.
Oh, thanks for the compliment.
At-at the hotel, I've got a photographer placed there.
Catch him with his pants down.
Pop.
Pop.
Click.
Click.
We fold up the tent and on to our, uh, meaningful lives.
All right, who is this guy?
Well, that's a secret, remember?
But, uh, I don't know, we can call him the Duke.
And is there a "Duchess"?
Oh, yeah, but she's hoping to become an ex-Duchess.
Or should I say a very rich ex-Duchess?
The, uh, photos are...
well, they're for her.
What, you're working on a divorce case?
Yeah.
- How cheesy.
- Wha...
This guy's a creep.
He's a wife beater, he deserves to be put away.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What's going on?
What are you guys doing here?
Kelly, your man is our deepest cover agent.
He's been working for the cause all week.
He has?
It's no big deal.
I, uh, I oversaw the making of a counterfeit Cornelius J. Condor in the art lab.
That's about it.
- You're kidding.
- Mm-hmm.
That's a decoy sitting in the Walsh Foyer.
Huh.
So, where's the real Corny?
Hmm, I have no idea.
Oh!
Hello?
Joe?
I thought you couldn't call.
Yeah, well, the guys are over at the Coach's for a chalk talk.
Donna, why didn't you tell me that you made the court?
You heard?
Yeah, I had to watch it on TV.
You looked so pretty, so excited.
Yeah, I was.
Hey, don't worry about me.
All right, everything works out for the best.
They do?
Yeah.
You just have to keep faith.
That's what my dad always used to say, and he made a believer out of me.
I can't believe how calm you are.
Anything more happen with the police?
Yeah, uh, the city attorney reviewed Ray's complaint and pressed formal charges.
I'm really sorry.
No one's supposed to know until Monday.
That's when I'm being arraigned.
Well, is there anything
- I can do?
- Yeah.
I'm sure my lawyer would love to talk to you tomorrow.
Oh.
Okay.
Sure, um... any time.
I just have to be at the Tournament House in the afternoon.
Just tell him to call me.
Okay, I will.
Uh, his name is Bruce Paxton.
Look, I'd better get going.
I'll talk to you soon.
And, uh...
I really miss you, Donna.
I miss you, too.
You know, I don't get it.
Is it too much to ask?
Can you at least stand up?
Jonesy, my feet are killing me, okay?
Face it, the white limo is not coming.
Well, you might be right.
I should probably pull the plug.
Terrific.
Jonesy, have a great life.
Sorry it didn't work out.
No, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
You gotta trust me here.
Now this guy is a... he's a, he's a creature of habit, all right?
I think we should get one more night.
Besides, little girl, you owe me.
Sanders, I know I agreed to this little homecoming stunt, but could you please keep Muntz and company from dropping chips and beer nuts all over 953 Hillcrest Drive, huh?
Hey, chill, man.
It'll all be over tonight.
You look like you could use some fun.
Why don't you hang out with us tonight?
No.
I've got stuff to do at McKay's and a column to write.
Just don't turn my house into a frat sty.
He'll snap out of it.
Okay, well, thank you for coming in.
Whatever I can do.
Well, you're an eyewitness, Donna.
Your word carries lots of weight.
You know, I, uh, I was wondering what could happen to Joe if he's found guilty?
Well, the maximum penalty is a $2,000 fine and six months in jail.
Don't worry about that.
After hearing your side of the story,
I think we have a defense here;
Joe was protecting you.
But the thing is, after Monday's arraignment, the fact that you were abused by your ex-boyfriend is going to become a matter of public record.
So, you ready for that?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I will be as soon as I tell my parents.
Steve, anything?
Yes!
Yes!
We have liftoff.
Shh, Valerie's still sleeping.
Not anymore.
She's up.
Sort of.
Sorry, Val.
No, you're not.
What am I, invisible?
Morning, David.
Hey, you want me to get you some juice or something?
You look pretty wasted.
Oh, yeah, that would be great.
Thanks.
I guess I got in pretty late, huh?
Yeah.
Well, I, I gave up calling after 1:30.
So, how'd it go?
Listen, I don't want to talk about it.
Just don't make a big deal about it, okay?
Well, whatever it was, I'm, uh, I'm glad it's over.
I'm gonna take you out tonight, so I don't want any arguments.
David, I can't go out tonight.
This business isn't finished.
I gotta know.
Um...
Is there a... a guy involved?
Just tell me that.
Please, no questions, okay?
I mean, I'll be able to tell you someday.
I just can't tell you right now.
So there is a guy involved.
Yes, but it's not what you think.
What guy?
Are you gonna get me juice or not?
Do I know him?
Why are you acting so jealous?
I'm not jealous, all right?
I'm just upset 'cause you won't be honest with me.
You know what?
Forget about the juice.
Just forget about the good mornings.
Just leave me the hell alone, okay?
I need a shower.
It's a nice outfit.
Who'd you wear this for?
David, look, I have a headache, okay?
It's not like we're married or something.
Just give me a little space here.
I'll give you tons of space.
You're acting so childish.
I really hate that.
How else can I act?
It's not like I'm one of the guys who gets to be adult with you.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know how you keep telling me to be patient with this relationship?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I think my patience just ran out.
Lisa.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Want to grab a bite to eat?
- Oh, I'd love to, but I've got to get straight to work.
I need to talk to my boss about my schedule.
I didn't realize there was gonna be so many fittings next week.
Well, if you ever need any help with anything, just ask.
I warn you, I'm not shy.
Who's that?
That's Ray.
The Ray?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
No, no, no, I'm gonna wait right here for you.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Donna.
How'd you know I was here?
You could get the schedule for the Royal Court just by calling.
Look, I'm really happy for you.
I kind of feel like I've been there since the beginning of all this.
How can you stand there sweet-talking me when you are making my life and Joe's a living hell?
Look, I gave you fair warning, and I'm gonna give you a second chance.
- What are you talking about?
- My lawyer said there's no case against Joe if I don't testify.
So, what do you want me to do?
Dump Joe and come running back to you?
Is that so bad?
We were happy, Donna.
No!
No, we were living a lie.
And anything more between us makes that a bigger lie.
Now go ahead with your charges.
The truth will come out.
Yeah, it will.
I'll see you in court.
Hi.
Hi.
I was driving by and I saw your car.
What's in the bag?
Good eats.
In case we get hungry.
Just driving by, huh?
Okay.
I didn't think you should have to do this alone.
Shouldn't you be off guarding Cornelius J. Condor or something?
Brandon, you're not the only one who misses him.
Sorry.
It's just I've been, I've been coming here all week and checking his messages and getting his mail and...
I don't think he's ever coming back.
So, why do I bother?
Because you're his friend, and you love him.
And that's not ever gonna change for you or for me.
Well...
I'm glad you came.
Good.
Do you want some help or not?
Yes.
Fine, I want some help.
Good.
Hey.
How you doing?
Okay, I'm gonna call you, all right?
I will.
I promise.
Valerie?
Where're you going?
Don't be going anywhere.
What's the matter with you?
Look, I'm going to get some coffee.
The guy can wait.
Let's get something clear, all right?
You have a chance to share in a sizable bonus.
- So?
- "So"?
So don't forget we are playing hardball.
Come on, batter up, girl.
You know, this is all making me a little too hard.
I think I lost my boyfriend today.
Yeah, well, that might be for the best.
I mean, he's probably one of these guys who's just gonna fade when the chips are down.
You know, I can't believe I'm getting dating advice from a guy that Dylan told me travels with an inflatable doll.
See, right there, man.
Right there, right there.
Rumors, rumors, ru...
Wait a second.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Come on.
Uh-uh.
Shoo.
Shoo, shoo.
I got just the ticket for you tonight, sport.
I'm sorry.
I'm just looking for directions.
No, no.
Listen to me closely.
I can get you into paradise tonight.
Meet Heavenly.
Are you gonna leave me standing here, or can I come in?
Well, I'm not sure I understand.
Let me make this real simple, okay?
$200 an hour and she gets in your car.
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Guaranteed.
Police officer.
Hold it right there.
- Put your hands on the car.
- Ahh...
What's going on?
We're cooked.
You're under arrest for violation 647B of the Penal Code of the state of California.
You have the right to remain silent.
If you choose to give up that right, everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Do you understand those rights?
Yes.
Come on.
Easy, easy, easy!
Aw.
I hate you.
You asked for it.
Hi, Susan.
Come on in.
I am in.
- This probably looks pretty strange.
- Yeah.
Oh, please, don't, uh, stop on my account.
Really, I just brought by these brownies.
I thought you might need a little sugar rush.
No, no, don't need that.
How are you at controlling a, uh, killer plastic robot?
Oh, go ahead, really.
I don't need to play.
Oh, yes, you do, because I am late for a very important date, and I guess we got a little carried away here.
It's all my fault.
I never should've given Dylan this in the first place.
I can't believe he kept it.
Well,
I'm gonna leave while I am still undefeated.
She lies.
Hey, Kel, thanks for all your help.
I-I appreciate it.
You're welcome.
Looks like Kelly got you out of your funk.
Yeah, well, she's a good friend.
I, uh, baked them myself.
Well, you know, I-I don't really deserve one.
I haven't, uh, written my column yet.
You know, I don't care.
I want to be a good friend, too.
Actually, I want to be a lot more than a good friend.
Hello.
David.
Valerie?
I'm sleeping.
Good-bye.
Don't hang up, okay.
You're my one call.
What?
Listen, just listen to me very carefully.
I need you to bail me out.
You're in jail?
Can you get a thousand dollars in cash?
What are you in jail for?
I'm in Central Detention downtown.
I'll, uh, I'll tell you why later.
No, no, no, tell me now.
What'd they arrest you for?
Prostitution.
What?
You're serious?
It was all a mistake.
Please, just hurry, okay?
That's it, honey.
Everybody's waiting.
Here's your stuff, honey.
I'll get your walking papers.
Thank you.
Sure.
So, are you okay?
Yeah.
I guess I really disappointed you.
I guess.
Listen, David, I want to explain.
Not now.
You know, Val, I can't help thinking...
You could've phoned anyone with that one call.
I mean...
Brandon, Steve, Nat...
But you called me.
Wasn't even close.
Why?
You're the only one I can let see me like this.
I'm really embarrassed, David.
Don't be.
We'll handle it.
Oh...
Val!
Well, here we are.
I was just, uh, getting to you.
Well, you're a little late.
Listen, I am so sorry, putting you through what you had to go through, but, uh...
Oh, Val, you gotta look at the bright side of things, huh?
Well, I hope you pulled some strings.
Strings?
I pulled the whole rope.
Now, uh, all the charges have been dropped and, uh, your record is clean.
- Who is this clown?
- Clown?
- Yeah.
- Why?
Are you laughing?
David!
David, listen.
Wait.
This is Jay J. Jones.
- David?
- Yeah.
Detective, um... he's a friend of Dylan's.
And a friend of yours, Val.
So, uh... this is the, uh, new boyfriend, huh?
I've heard all about you.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't say the same.
Well, I'm sure our gal Val will fill you in.
You see, kid, we were on a mission last night, fighting for the forces of good.
But unfortunately, uh... we lost.
So I noticed.
What happened?
What happened?
Well, apparently the Duke got wind of our little sting through a friend of his wife and decided to sting us instead.
Well, it worked.
Yeah.
But I'm happy to report that I got half the money up front.
Of course, I'm sad to report that little lady won't be seeing any of the bonus.
Well, that's all right, because I already got my bonus... a guy who doesn't fade.
Thanks for agreeing to see me.
Make this quick.
We got a pregame meeting over at the field.
Okay, I can make it quick.
Look, I just don't want you or the other guys to be mad at Joe because of me.
Yeah, sure.
No problem.
See ya.
Please.
I don't think you understand, and...
I didn't understand until yesterday.
Understand what?
I don't think Joe told you the whole story about what went down Halloween night.
We heard enough.
Look, the night that Joe broke curfew, he wasn't partying.
He was protecting me from an abusive ex-boyfriend.
He was scared that I was in danger... and I was.
I'm sorry.
He really should've said something.
Yeah, well, I think he was more concerned about my reputation than anything else, and I think that's the same reason why he's such a great leader on the field.
'Cause he's more concerned about everyone else than himself.
So...
You'll have to forgive her guys.
I think she's laying it on a little thick.
I don't think so.
A.K., you're team captain.
Am I exaggerating about Joe?
No.
I think she's dead on.
All right, Condors!
Okay...
Okay, well, it's game day.
Right on.
The big question on everybody's lips other than are we gonna win is...
- Where's Corny?
!
- Where's Corny?
!
Yeah!
Where's Corny?
Exactly.
So if you'll take a look at the big screen behind me, you'll find out.
Not exactly.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
In case you may have heard that Corny was being paraded around the S.C.U. campus, well it's not true.
It's not true.
The real Corny is right here!
All right, let's give it up for my Condor Commandos!
We've got Clare Arnold.
Stand up, Clare.
We have Kelly Taylor.
We have Assistant Professor Colin Robbins and a host of others who didn't do enough to get singled out.
And Madman Muntz.
Go!
Condors!
- Go!
- Condors!
- Condors!
- Go!
- Go!
- Condors!
All right!
What a catch!
What a start to this important Pac-10 game.
That 42-yard reception leaves the Bears within breathing room of another touchdown.
It's been four minutes of football that the Condor fans would rather forget,
The whole team is definitely looking for a wake-up call that has not come.
And here go the Bears, first and goal.
The snap...
Kreuscher drifts back to pass.
Look out, there's the Condor's number 55, A.K. Carson, bearing down on him.
Kreuscher is sacked!
What a hit.
You got your column?
Yeah, you gave it to me a couple of days ago.
Really?
What's your lead?
"Friendship sucks."
You're writing about Dylan, aren't you?
Yeah.
Save a copy for him.
You never know.
Coach Lyons is sending in a play from the sidelines.
And here we go.
That's fourth and seven.
The Condors are forced to punt.
There's a snap.
The kick's away...
It looks good.
Bears take it at their own 32.
The Condors have to consider themselves lucky,
That's the truth.
The whole team looks lost without Bradley.
The Condor fans with that Joe Bradley...
Can we, uh, turn off the game for a second?
There's something I need to tell you and Mom.
Yeah, sure.
It's about why Joe isn't playing in the game today, but more than that, it's about me and Ray.
I thought I could avoid telling you guys, but I have to.
It's kind of like how you had to tell me your secret, Mom.
Okay, what is it, sweetheart?
Mom...
Dad... this is really hard for me.
There was something really terrible going on between me and Ray.
He was hurting me.
What?
You mean, physically?
Yeah.
Oh, Donna.
Look, if you don't mind,
I don't really want to get into the details.
It's just kind of humiliating.
I just wanted you guys to know that I'm okay.
Palm Springs.
You didn't fall down those stairs, did you?
No.
Here I was going on about how much he loved you.
We couldn't understand why the two of you weren't together anymore.
He seemed like such a good kid all summer long on the boat.
I never would have guessed.
Well, it didn't happen all the time, but when it did, it was kind of bad.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, Mom.
I'm sorry.
Anyway I just...
I wanted you guys to know why Joe wasn't playing today.
It's because he protected me when Ray tried to do this again.
And now he might go to jail for it.
Oh, no, we're not gonna let that happen.
Donna, we're gonna do everything we can.
We're gonna stand behind you and Joe all the way.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Sweetheart,
I don't want you ever to feel afraid to tell me anything.
Same goes for you, Mom.
Oh, you.
Nat, I need two mega burgers and an order of fried zucchini.
Done.
Oh, spread the word...
in honor of the 35 points that the Condors scored in the second half,
I'm taking 35% off of everything on the menu.
Nat, what's gotten into you?
I can remember a time, and it wasn't so long ago, that everything would be on the house.
Hey, if I did that for every C.U. victory this season, I'd be out of business.
This team's going to the Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl...!
Rose Bowl's a definite possibility now.
That was a huge win.
I knew those guys could pull it off.
Yeah, the team wouldn't quit.
Quit?
Are you kidding?
They smoked those Bears.
Maybe they play better with Mac as quarterback.
Well, I wouldn't worry.
I think it's just like your father says, things always work out for the best.
Yeah, well, I hope that applies to the case, too.
I'm so exhausted, I need a vacation.
Well, Thanksgiving will take care of that.
Oh, no, no, no, there'll be no rest for Steve on Thanksgiving.
We're having dinner at Casa Walsh.
So, book early, kids.
Count me in.
How about you, Colin?
You up for a little left-coast feast?
I meant to tell you, I'm going back to New York for the holiday.
You are?
Well, you're no fun.
You should tell that to Susan.
She's going to New York, too.
Okay, go Big Apple on us.
I think we can get along without them.
Do you think we can?
I think we can.
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl, Rose Bowl...!
You know, you haven't asked me a single question about what happened.
I uh, don't really care anymore.
You're the only one who believes in me.
And I always will.
Meimi Haneoka is 14 years old.
By day she is a happy student at St. Paulia School.
But at night, she becomes the thief St. Tail... to do good deeds for all who come asking the help of Seira... a nun in training.
Looking to capture the elusive St. Tail is an amateur detective... and Meimi's classmate, Asuka Jr.
As for Meimi... she may have more than a bit of interest in such a determined boy.
Legend of Happiness?
The Clock Tower Commotion
Did you see the ad for the Wonder Garden?
It just opened this month.
Oh, I love amusement parks!
Actually, I've already been there.
Who with?
!
If you must know...
Look, it's Tominaga from class C!
Since when?
It's a wonderful place.
The flowers are really lovely.
But the main attraction is... this!
The mechanical clock of Wonder Castle!
The dolls move and it's so beautiful.
It was built by a famous foreign doll-maker.
Every one of his creations costs a huge amount of money.
Also, it's said that if... you watch this clock with the one you love, it'll bring happiness.
And you watched it together!
Yeah.
How wonderful!
I'm jealous, I've never even been on a date.
Who do you want to date, Meimi?
Don't tell me you want to date Asuka Jr.
Don't be silly!
Who'd want to date a dinky detective like him?
!
Just who do you think you're calling "dinky"?
!
If that bugs you, why don't you go ahead... and catch St. Tail, you bungling detective!
Even if I do capture her, I'm not letting you see her!
Who cares, she's not like some beetle on display, is she?
!
Shut up!
Same to you!
Hey, Asuka!
Yeah, I'm coming.
Seira...
What is it?
Meimi, there's only one reason why I would ask you to come here.
I have a favor to ask of St. Tail.
Something that only she can do.
The doll at the amusement park?
Yes, and it's located in a very high place.
You mean that amusement park?
Yes, Wonder Garden Amusement Park.
Then, by a high place, you must mean...
The mechanical clock of Wonder Castle.
This girl tied a precious doll that she had brought with her... to the strings of her balloons.
This is the doll you want me to get?
Yes, she borrowed the doll from a friend... and must return it the next time they meet.
However...
The doll!
They contacted the amusement park... but were told to forget about the doll.
All I have to do is get the doll back.
That's easy.
Only, you have to get it back by Sunday.
Sunday... that's tomorrow.
The doll's owner is coming to the girl's house tomorrow to play.
She needs it by then.
Which means I have to do it tonight.
And the doll emerges from the clock on the hour.
So you have to get the doll before the balloon carries it away.
Okay, leave it to me.
I'm home!
Welcome back, Meimi.
What's up?
This...
You haven't gone there yet, have you?
Huh...?
No.
We were just about to go.
Do you want to come, too?
It'll complicate things if I go with them...
You want to go, don't you?
Yes.
Good.
Besides, you might find some ideas for new magic tricks.
Jeez, they always use me as an excuse.
You want to come?
But I've got work to do...
Ready yet?
Almost.
I want you to stay home and watch the house.
It's been a long time since I've been to an amusement park.
It's time for the doll to come out.
Hey, hey... what's the rush?
I have something I want to see!
There.
It's almost time.
Asuka Jr.!
Haneoka!
What brings you here?
To have fun... what else?
Yeah, that makes sense.
So that's the clock tower the girls were fussing over?
When you watch it with the one you love... it brings happiness.
Why don't they come out?
Hey there, what's going on?
Is something wrong?
It's just some malfunction.
There's a temp repairman here, if I remember correctly.
Yes, I'll get him!
They say it's just some malfunction.
See you.
Ah!
...
My balloon!
That's right.
At least I can check if the balloons are still there.
Too bad, Meimi.
I'm going to go get some ice cream.
"Employees Only"
Oh, it's a costume.
Good, it's still there.
Good work.
All I did was remove a gear.
Piece of cake.
The big job's coming up.
Identical dolls.
Why bother with all this stuff?
Why not just go ahead and steal it?
The police are on guard.
Sometimes it's better to use your brain.
Well, faking a malfunction... and switching the dolls during the repair...
I guess that's using your brain.
Which means those are all fakes!
Who's there?
!
Cool it!
It's nothing!
Okay, let's get to work.
They won't get away with this!
Bye.
Please come by.
It's an ad for Wonder Garden.
"I'm going to Wonder Garden tonight to get the doll...
St. Tail."
How dare she!
She was in that rabbit costume!
I'll return this later.
Haneoka!
What?
!
That amusement park...
That clock at Wonder Castle with the dolls that's said to...
You mean... bring happiness to couples when they view it together.
Yeah.
Is he trying to ask me to go with him?
About how much is it worth?
Excuse me?
Is it true that it's very expensive?
It's supposed to be.
Why would she do something so villainous?
!
I got it, never mind.
See you.
What's with him, anyway!
I hate him!
He's so insensitive.
Oh, look who's grouchy.
I'll take you the next time I go.
I've got to get to work.
Meimi.
Meimi?
Are you there?
Oh, no!
What's wrong?
She's not answering.
What are you doing over there?
I was thinking of going to get some juice or something.
From the window?
I thought I'd try something new.
I'll be off, then.
Going in and out of the window at night.
She's my girl, all right.
Please forgive me, for I use no gimmick or trick.
One!
Two!
Three!
May the blessings of God be with us.
That doll was specially made.
It's invaluable...
There's only one of its kind in the world.
If it were ever stolen...
Please be rest assured...
St. Tail always has some reason for stealing.
I'm sure it's the same this time.
You can't be too sure.
Dad!
If the latest artwork thefts are the work of St. Tail... then everything falls into place.
No, it can't be.
You're still green, son.
She may be called "Saint", but she's no more than a thief.
I'm done with the repairs for now.
All right, thanks.
Don't mention it.
What an idiot.
If St. Tail is going to appear... it'll be when the dolls come out.
What the...?
!
"These dolls are fake!
St. Tail"
St. Tail!
When did she...?
!
Don't tell me she switched them with fakes!
St. Tail!
Where is she?
!
Stay calm, don't leave your posts!
They still don't get it?
Talk about dense.
I won't let you get away!
She's trying to confuse us with bits of paper!
I can see right through you.
Light her face up!
Her face!
I can see right through you, too!
If you want to light up something... leave it to St. Tail!
It's Show Time!
The lights are moving by themselves!
What's going on?
We don't light up at night.
Now for the real show.
Hold it!
St. Tail!
I can't see!
Identical dolls.
These!
These are the real ones!
And there's the statue that was stolen last week.
Dad!
You're under arrest!
Ouch, you're squashing me, too!
St. Tail!
The rest of you, go after St. Tail!
Here goes.
One...
Two...
Three!
Asuka Jr!
Which one should we arrest?
!
Yikes!
What the...?
!
Do you have a St. Tail parade or something at this amusement park?
!
Of course not!
I lost her.
Fantastic, isn't it?
St. Tail's illusion parade!
There's no way to find me in all this.
No way!
Don't underestimate me.
No matter where you go...
I'll find you!
How?
You're not getting away!
Asuka Jr.!
That's dangerous!
Fool!
I won't... miss this chance!
Like I said...
I'm taking the doll with me!
The doll...
That's the doll you wanted?
If you had asked me out, it would've made me happy.
But... it turned out to be like a date, anyway!
I really enjoyed myself!
Date...?
Cut the jokes!
I'm serious, you know!
I'm serious... darn.
Thank you, Asuka Jr.
All of the dolls have been recovered, thanks to you.
Those two turned out to be the ones responsible for the art thefts.
I thought it was strange for her to do such a thing.
What?
No, it's nothing.
Don't ever tie it to a balloon again.
It brings happiness if you watch it together with the one you love.
Well, who cares...
My nights are always filled with the prospect of happiness.
Well?
Hi!
What are you doing, Haneoka?
There's going to be a contest.
A contest?
You know Miki from our class?
Yeah...
She's entering the Junior Design Contest that the city's putting on.
And I'm going to model the wedding dress!
Model?
You?
She said I'm perfect for it.
I've already gone for the fitting.
I'm just waiting to see the finished product.
And who's going to be the groom?
The Frog Prince?
Frog's Bride
How rude!
Asuka Jr., you're always making fun of me!
It's nothing, I'm just being honest.
Why you!
Miss Takamiya...
Contest in Chaos
Is there something you want from me, Miss Takamiya?
Oh, nothing.
I just happen to be going this way, too!
Don't mind me.
I see.
Darn.
She got away.
Hush, Meimi.
You must be quiet in the chapel.
I finally got away from Takamiya.
She's been following me all over the for place the past few days.
Really?
She's very persistent, isn't she?
By the way, have you seen Miki?
My wedding dress is supposed to be ready today!
She... came to see me about that, just a little while ago.
She did?
Yes.
The truth is...
What did you want to talk to me about?
Someone stole the drawing for my design.
Who'd do such a thing?
I think I know.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I have such long legs.
Miss Suzushiro...
It's Suzushiro from Group E. We're competing in the same contest.
Mami Suzushiro?
Yes.
I'm sure that's when it was stolen.
She's always thought of me as a rival.
If she uses my design in the contest, it'll put me in a difficult position... because her presentation comes before mine.
I don't know what to do.
Miki, don't lose faith.
The right will always be rewarded.
And that's what happened.
I see... and I was looking forward to the contest.
Meimi, please get her design back for her.
Alright!
Leave it to me.
At least, I wish I could.
It's Miss Takamiya.
With her following me around, I can't turn into St. Tail.
Don't give up hope.
You'll think of something, Meimi.
I'm trying!
I want to wear that wedding dress and model in the contest too!
But...
I understand.
I'll help you this time.
You will?
I'll fix you an alibi.
In the meantime, you become St. Tail and get the design.
Hold on.
What do you mean by alibi?
First, you specify the contest's date on the challenge to Asuka Jr.
Okay.
And then...
"...at the Conversational English Seminar..."
Hey, Asuka, are you listening?
Be quiet, will you?
I asked you if you wanted to know St. Tail's identity!
Are you still harping on that?
What a pest.
I told you what I think.
I don't care who she is!
I just want to arrest her!
All right then, I won't tell you.
Fine, I don't care.
Junior Design Contest.
So this is what Haneoka's been worked up about.
What's so great about it, anyway?
"Tomorrow, at the Junior Design Contest...
I will steal Mami Suzushiro's wedding dress design drawing.
-St.
Tail"
Of all the nerve!
I've been waiting for this.
I knew she'd make a move.
That St. Tail...
she's after a wedding dress this time!
I'm going to follow my own lead this time.
Good luck!
Huh, what?
!
We'll soon learn St. Tail's true identity.
Suit yourself!
You were so cute back then, Mama.
And you were a bit slimmer, Papa.
No magic will bring back the old you, huh?
Of all the...
Change back, change back, change back... or something like that... wow!
Oh, it's you, Meimi.
Shame on you.
You're a professional magician.
That shouldn't catch you off guard.
Well, I... what's up, Meimi?
There's a wedding dress contest tomorrow.
I'm one of the models.
She's going to get married one of these days, isn't she?
It's too early to start getting lonely, Papa.
Tomorrow, I have to be St. Tail and a bride.
I've got to work hard at both!
What's wrong?
You want to go with me?
I'm sorry, Ruby, you have to stay home.
Hey you, you better do a good job protecting me.
Sure, of course, to some degree.
What do you mean, 'to some degree'?
!
I mean, St. Tail is sure to appear after the contest begins.
That's why...
You're positive?
Yes, that's why you can relax until then.
So, I'll see you later.
I think they can protect themselves.
Green Room 1
What are you doing here, Miss Takamiya?
Nothing.
I was looking for a phone.
I have to call Asuka.
You there.
Me?
You're not wearing an ID tag.
Only models and contestants are allowed in here.
Please leave.
She's sticking to you like glue.
She's not moving from that spot, not for anything.
Seira, are you sure it's all right for me to participate?
You have nothing to worry about, Miki.
Right, hang in there.
Get out of the way!
You're in my way!
Is that Mami Suzushiro?
Yes.
That dress!
It's definitely the one I designed.
I won't let them get away with this.
Let's put on a good show, shall we, Kono?
Yes.
Of course.
See you later, then.
The city's Junior Design Contest will soon begin.
Final preparations are being made.
All contestants, please assemble on the stage.
I have to go.
I'll be there as soon as I change.
Don't worry, I'll help her change.
Thank you.
I'll leave it to you.
Takamiya, you're welcome to watch.
Oh, gee, thanks.
Seira, let's get going.
Okay.
She's changing.
We've got to be quiet.
Oh Lord, forgive me, for I use no gimmick or trick.
One!
Two!
Three!
Oh, dear!
Transforming into St. Tail quietly is so hard!
Meimi.
Oh Seira, you're beautiful!
Once I put on the wig and veil, everyone will think it's you.
Oh dear, and I'm supposed to be a nun.
I'm counting on you to put on a good act and keep Takamiya here.
I will, be careful too.
May the blessings of God be with us.
What are those two doing in there?
Miss...
Judging by your looks you must be one of the models.
The contest is starting.
You'd better change.
But, I'm...!
Is this your dressing room?
No.
Then it's this way.
W...
Wait a minute!
You're making a mistake!
Meimi, now's your chance.
Okay.
I thought I saw a black shadow there.
It must have been your imagination.
Oh boy.
Show's starting.
I'm so nervous.
Me, too.
Everything is going good so far.
Now for the hard part.
We will begin the judging at this time.
Entry #1.
Hey!
No!
My design!
Look!
What's that?
When is she going to turn into St. Tail, I wonder?
Hurry up, Meimi.
Haneoka, don't you have to go?
Yes, but my number is last.
Hmmm.
Oh, Meimi, please hurry!
Whoah!
Good evening!
Please, God!
We are experiencing a power failure.
For your safety, please remain seated.
St. Tail is here in the hall!
What are you doing?
!
That's impossible!
Haneoka's still here.
Meimi.
The entire hall is in an uproar, but stand by, okay?
Okay.
Takamiya?
Phew.
They're gone.
Now, I've got to get this ready.
Everyone, quiet, please.
What's going on there?
!
That's the dress.
It's Show Time!
Hey!
Wait!
What is this?
!
Sorry, you have to wear that instead.
I'm taking the design.
I'm giving this back to the real designer.
What?
!
Don't just stand there, get her!
Just hold it!
What does she mean, 'real designer'?
!
Um...!
And this is in apology for causing such a commotion here.
Wow!
Bouquets?
!
For the future brides.
Hold it!
Bouquets from St. Tail!
I want one too!
Ooh, they're beautiful!
Outta my way!
Let me through!
She got away.
And what are you doing?
!
None of your business!
Junior Designer Contest
There, it's finished.
Fly up high.
Asuka!
She's heading for the exit!
She got away again.
Where's Meimi?
Takamiya!
Now where's she going?
Green Room 1
Impossible.
What'd you come back here for?
Well, Asuka Jr., isn't she beautiful?
For goodness sake, say something.
Miki, that's enough.
Yeah, really beautiful.
Really very beautiful...
Your design that is.
Oh my, thank you.
But that's not what I meant!
So...
So that's what St. Tail was after!
He's trying to change the subject.
How typical of a man.
Asuka, let's go.
O...
Okay.
Entry #30, you're up next.
Report to the stage immediately.
Meimi, let's go.
Yes.
Hey, Takamiya, you can go without me.
Asuka, where are you going?
It's none of your business!
Bye!
And the winning entry in the Junior Designers Contest is... #30, Miki Kono's design!
Miki, you did it!
Congratulations!
Meimi!
It's not fair!
A wedding dress sure is mysterious.
It even makes Meimi seem different.
And what if she's St. Tail?
What?
I'm asking you how you'd feel if she was St. Tail?
What are you talking about?
That's a really bad joke.
It's no joke.
I'll even make a bet on it.
Stop it!
Is that why you've been following her around?
She's one of your classmates.
All right, how about this then?
If Meimi isn't St. Tail, then I'll stop following her.
You promise?
But if I'm right, you'll have to date me.
What?
Well?
You promise you'll stop following her?
All right.
There's no way... that Meimi is St. Tail.
Wouldn't be on the first floor, would it?
Ambulance!
Yeah.
Yeah, here you are, love.
In 'ere.
It's the old fella.
He's collapsed on the couch.
Let's have a look at him, eh?
This is his grand-daughter.
You were here when this happened, were you?
Yeah, I just come in and found him on the couch.
What's his name?
Dave Carr.
Dave!
Dave!
Is he gonna be all right?
Dave?
Dave?
No response there, Dave.
No response, yeah...
How's he doing, love?
He's okay at the moment so let's just keep our fingers crossed.
Does he have any other close relatives at all?
There's my mum.
She lives in Wales, so, I mean, she doesn't see him often
Her and me dad have split up.
Paul, make the hospital.
He's just gone on us, mate.
Oh, God!
Have we lost him?
Oh, God, Dot!
It's all right...

(SPANISH TROOPS REVOLT IN MOROCCO)
(THE DAILY WORKER)
(ALL INTO ACTION NOW!
DEFEND SPANISH REPUBLIC!
)
In February a coalition of socialist, republican and other left wing parties were victorious in the general election.
They proposed a series of democratic reforms.
The big landowners, industrialists, churchmen and army officers feared the growing power of the working class.
July 18th.
There was a military uprising led by the Fascist General Franco against the democratically elected government.
Government supporters formed militias to defend themselves.
Organised by trades unions and political parties, they went to fight for their democratic rights against the Fascists.
This, this is... this is the... one of the militias going to the Zaragosa front in, in Aragon.
You can see all the cars.
They've got the name of the workers' organisation... because they've all been nationalised, they've all been taken over by the workers.
That is the Union of, of the Railway workers.
This is the CNT... the anarchists' union.
As you can see... the support the whole of Barcelona is on the streets but with very few guns.
Most people haven't got guns.
You can see young, old, men, women.
These are the fascists.
The General, the defenders of privilege.
And this is what they are doing to us.
They are killed and left there... just for being trade unionists.
Every defeat for us is a defeat for you.
Every step that takes Franco closer to poser in Spain also takes the fascists closer to power here.
If Franco wins the war... it would be a major boost for fascists everywhere.
And before long, comrades... they will drag all freedom-loving people down to barbarism and, and war.
Comrades, whether Spanish or English, or American or Chinese we are one class of people with the same aspiration... the same hope for a just and equal society.
I want you to join with us... make our fight your fight.
Let's come together... let's come together...
Let's take up the slogan.
No Pasaran.
They shall not pass.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
You've got our support.
We're right behind you.
We wanna fight.
No Pasaran.
Kit...
I'm going to go to Spain.
What, just like that you're going to Spain?
Well, not just like that but...
It'll take a while to organise.
I'll go to Barcelona, sort it out from there.
Why you?
Why have you got to go?
Because I can.
I haven't got any kids or nothing.
I mean, you know... what am I doing here, Kit?
I'm on fifteen bob a week on the dole.
Y'know, there's millions of us, out of work.
I'm on, you know, demonstrations, hunger marches just...
I know.
I've been there with you.
I know.
But I want to do something.
And you can't do it here?
If we've got to do it, we've got to do it now.
We've got to stop them otherwise it's not, it's going to be too late, Kit.
We'll have no future here.
I can't spare you.
Come here.
Dear Kit... well I made it.
It was a bit tricky and the sea was rough.
I was glad to get off that ship.
But Larry, who smuggled me aboard, turned up trumps.
He got us ashore, in one piece, at Marseilles... and put us on the road to Spain.
And then I hitched a lift in a couple of lorries to the border.
It seems there's no organisation here to help volunteers like me you've just got to make your own way.
With no passport, crossing the frontier wasn't easy and I had to walk across the Pyrenees.
I must have climbed for miles.
My boots are all shot to pieces and my feet are steaming.
I was scared stiff but we made it.
Would you like to sit down?
Would you like to sit down?
Madam, could you please move the chickens?
Now I'm in Spain and everything is so bright it hurts your eyes.
I've 'copped' the train for Barcelona.
Maybe I'll see some action.
He said that they could use your feet as a weapon against Franco.
What do you do here?
Oh, I've come to fight for the Republic.
Good.
The more that come the sooner we'll win.
Do you want a drop?
Thanks.
Salud!
Gracias.
Smoke?
Smoke?
Oh, with pleasure.
My name is Bernard.
Bernard Goujon.
Pleased to meet you.
David Carr.
Bernard.
D'you smoke, lads?
Do you have papers, documentation?
Yeah, I've got my Party card.
My Com, Communist Party of Great Britain membership.
Yeah, I've got it here.
Look, it's like that.
See.
It's for a comrade of the POUM.
The what?
The POUM, P-O-U-M
Never heard of that?
No, never heard of the POUM.
It's Spanish workers' Party.
Revolutionaries.
Tickets, please.
He's with us, boss.
He's come to fight the fascists.
Welcome in Spain.
Thanks very much.
The Trade Union is controlling all the line.
Thanks.
Thanks.
So it's a present for you.
Oh, don't have to pay?
No, no, don't have to pay.
Thanks very much.
Thanks, comrade.
Gracias.
Left, right, left, right...
Alto!
Halt!
Turn to right.
Alto!
Turn to right.
Alto!
Hey, dickhead.
Make up your mind.
Shut up.
I'm in charge here.
I'm pissed off with this.
This is important pick it up immediately.
You pick it up.
I'm off.
Where are you going, love?
Don't call me "love".
Comrade, comrade...
I am going to Madrid.
Understand?
They take things seriously there.
This is vital for the revolution for both men and women.
We've got to have discipline we'll never win without it.
Where are we going going to get to with this...
This is just the beginning.
I want a gun.
You'll get to fight...
Please trust me...
Get back in the line... what are you lot gawking at?
Let's have some energy.
I've seen more life in a sick note.
Right!
Halt!
In Germany I was a pastry cook.
Pastry...
Yeah, pastry cook.
And you, Gene, what was your job?
Eleven years on the sea.
Bosun.
Bosun?
Yes.
I've just spent six days on the sea and it was not for me.
I was, went from Liverpool to Marseilles and I was sick all the time.
So...
I'm not a sailor.
I was a servant.
A cleaner.
Servant.
For an English family.
On the first day everything starts they went running to England so they left, they left me alone in Barcelona.
I'm free for the first time of my life.
Salud, camaradas.
Thank you, thank you.
You got the weapons?
Yes.
Antiques.
Antiques?
German, Mauser, 1896.
Single load.
How many?
Thirty.
Okay.
All right.
Be better using a big stick.
Okay.
Get these off and take them over there into the 'store place'.
When did you learn about guns?
Five years in French Army, I was sergeant.
Comrade.
Where you from?
Italiano.
Milano.
Italiano?
So you know fascism?
They're bastards.
Que?
Do you need some help?
No, I'll do it myself.
Vale, leona.
Aye, aye, soft ollies.
Are you taking the piss?
Want to change?
Come here!
Sit down.
Sit down, please.
Garibaldi, come here.
My name's Rafael Poccetti, Captain.
I know.
But I need Garibaldis more than I need Poccettis.
Sit down, please.
Leona, tu tambien.
Okay.
In the other side of the hill are the trenches.
Our trenches.
And beyond them is the enemy.
And the only good soldier in Franco's Army is a dead one.
My name is Vidal and I'm your Captain.
We are the POUM and we organise this section of the, of the front.
To the west of us are the anarchists.
And we fight together, comrades in arms to defeat, to destroy the fascists and make the workers' and peasants' revolution.
Understand?
Don't forget it.
You are welcome here because you are my speaking squad English.
Okay?
We are proud to have you fight with us in our side.
Hey, David...
look.
The whores are also at the front.
Yeah, but they're better looking than the ones back home.
Yeah?
Good morning, Coogan, your reinforcements are here now.
I thought it was Sunday.
Dear Kit.
Well, I'm a soldier now with the POUM Militia.
It's a People's Army.
Just ordinary men and women fighting for a cause not like the Army back home.
There's no saluting'.
We elect the officers, and everything's discussed and voted on
It's socialism in action.
I'm in a special section... it's mainly internationals but some Spainish... and the common language is English, so we get by.
An Irishman called Coogan is in charge.
We're all on the same pay ten pesetas a day which is kept for us for when we go on leave.
And we also get a packet of fags a day, which isn't bad.
It's a huge operation, about twenty thousand militia on this front alone.
I'm not in the communist brigade, but it doesn't matter cos we're all fightin' the same enemy.
Viva Franco!
Viva Espana!
Fascists bastards.
Rot in hell!
Sons of bitches!
Fascists, you've got no balls.
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse.
Hey, rich bastard, you'll die with nothing.
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse!
You must be used to this weather coming from your godforsaken town.
It never stops fuckin' raining!
You been, have you?
Yeah, five years, Manchester.
Staring at the poxy rain through prison bars.
What d'you get put down for?
Fightin' the Brits.
Murderer...
Murderer of a free nation.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
There's all sorts here...
French, German, Yanks, Spanish of course, and a Scot by the name of Jimmy.
All good lads.
The front line doesn't seem to move.
We watch the fascists, and they watch us.
Lots of hanging about waiting' for something to happen.
Digging trenches, going out on patrol, sentry duty.
But worst of all is the lice.
They're worse than the nits back home.
They send you mad.
They lay their eggs in the lining of your trousers and you can't get rid of 'em.
You're forever scratching.
The food's not great... it's usually bread and beans which gives us all a problem...
I could murder some cabbage and ribs.
The local women do the cooking.
It's strange to see women in the trenches fighting alongside the men.
But no need to worry, Kit, none of them could hold a candle to you.
Max...
You know what we said the other day when we came down... about Blanca being a whore.
You know, a prostitute.
Who?
Who?
Who?
You said that Blanca was a prostitute - a whore!
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Good one.
Good one?
Good one!
Yeah!
Yours are winding me up.
Everybody knows... except you.
Maite...?
True.
You know, David, Blanca has told me some stories... crazy ones.
Hard life...
Hard life... hard one!
In fact, Jose can tell you, you know.
He knows her very well, you konw, because...
She knows how to do it... she's good and cheap.
Good and cheap, yeah.
Leave him alone.
David, it's the right moment.
Listen, she likes you, I tell you.
Good luck!
All right?
Yeah.
Do you want a cigarette?
No, thanks.
So, I mean, I was just thinking if you're not busy later on you might want to... you know, go for a walk with me.
You know...
I don't understand you.
Maybe me and you, you know, like... with, with Coogan.
When we saw you the other day...
Coogan is my man.
D'you understand?
Yeah.
Si.
Before the war we live together.
We join in the militia together.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got...
we fight together.
Sorry about that.
Sorry.
Yeah.
I'll see you later then.
You shower of bastards!
You...
I'll have a fuckin' word with you in a minute!
Have a nice time?
Have a nice time?
Yes, I did, thank you very much.
Marcel!
David?
Look.
Uh?
Fascist prisoners.
No!
An officer as well.
How many?
Besides the officer, there's...
Lawrence, Coogan, Jimmy.
I wonder where they found them?
I dunno.
This fucking senora wants a word with you.
Him and his sons, we found them behind the lines.
Doing a recce or something.
Anyway, they were lost.
At ease.
What's your name, lad?
Jose.
Jose?
Are you hungry?
Take them and get them something to eat, Jim.
And where are you going?
I've some questions for you.
I don't have to answer.
I'm a professional soldier.
Support the government elected by the people.
It's not a real government.
Muy bien...
How many soldiers in your command?
Have you got machine-guns?
Artillery?
Do your soldiers obey you?
Of course... we're a real army.

Mail.
No.
No.
No.
Sorry.
Coogan, over here.
Oh, great.
Pigat...
Are you alright?
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Leave me alone.
I want to go home.
What's wrong?
I'm going home, okay?
Why?
I've got things to sort out.
You're crazy... you can't just leave like this.
I came here willingly and I'll leave when I feel like it, okay?
No, it's not that easy.
You can't just go when you want to.
There's a discipline here.
My woman's fucking another man.
Who'll sort it out?
You?
Vidal?
Okay.
What are you going to do?
String the son of a bitch up by his balls.
And what good would that do?
Tell me, what good would that do?
Make me feel better.
Stay here... with your companeros.
I came here for her, for my daughter, the future.
You've got a daughter?
She was two last month.
What's her name?
Lidia.
Look...
If we don't win this war there'll be no future for anybody.
Right?
Not for Lidia, not for your wife, not you, not me, not anyone.
Do you understand?
The photos'll give you some idea of how cold it was.
But what they don't show is how the rain turned everything into freezing mud.
We seemed to spend all our time searching for firewood anything that'd burn and keep us warm.
This Coogan fella's a bit of a wild one.
Ex-IRA.
He's always first on patrol and last one back.
He knows what he's doing, but he does take chances.
His girlfriend's called Blanca.
She's in our section.
She's a bit of a character an' all.
Sharp as a razor.
They're not always hanging on to one another, but everyone knows they're a couple.
The worst thing about being here is doing nothing.
It seems we're just sittin' around and talkin' and arguing' politics all the time.
I come all this way to fight fascists and I can't get to grips with them.
Still... at last things are warming up a bit, not just the weather either.
Tomorrow's a big day.
We're attacking a village held by the fascists.
Think of us.
Lots of love, David.
Take off your sacks!
Vamos alla, valientes!
David, come on!
What's going on?
No!
No!
Chuck us a cartridge.
Hey, chuck us a fucking cartridge!
There's women down there!
Danny, you can't be serious.
Give us a fucking cartridge!
Danny, you can't put their lives in danger.
Coogan!
Coogan!
Fuego!
Don't shoot!
Speak to me!
Speak to me.
Speak to me!
This is the pig that was shooting from the tower.
Quiet!
Su rifle aun esta caliente.
I'm going to ask one simple question.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
Tell me the truth.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
There's the proof.
What's this then?
Kill him!
He informed on five comrades from the Union, and they're dead now.
Yeah, kill him.
What happened?
They took my husband and shaved my head.
Why?
Why?
Because my husband was in the militia.
Y no lo pudieren coger.
Eran anarquistas.
They were young anarchists.
Somebody say to the priest in confession where they were.
He told this to the fascists.
He knew the fascists kill them.
Murderer!
We've got to kill him.
Delato a nuestros companeros!
And we'll see you in three days...
Two or three days.
I'll stay here with twenty men for three days.
Very nice indeed.
Very nice.
I'm happy you appreciate French good taste.
Hola chico!
Gracias, amiga.
Blanca...
I just want you to know how sorry I am for what happened.
I should have opened fire but I didn't and, and they got him.
That's all there is to it.
The thing is, he was a good man.
You know, he was a brave man.
We're all going to miss him.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I...
Oh, come on... come on... when I met him the first time... he was playing... how do you say...
The guitar?
No.
Yeah, the smaller one.
Banjo?
Yeah.
He was playing banjo.
In bars and cafes.
I'm sorry, Blanca, you know, it's my fault.
And I...
No.
No, I'm...
I'm responsible because...
No.
You didn't kill him.
Fascists did.
He said he just wanted, like, bullets and I said that, like, I wouldn't...
It could have happened sooner or later to any of us.
We feel a great sorrow today, but it must not halt our efforts.
Our companions have not died in vain.
Josefina, Sebastian, Teresa all of you we all fight for the same things as they did.
And we shall continue it's what they would have wanted.
They're here with us, fighting for the same cause.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many.
But we are more, we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
The struggle goes on.
They shall no pass.
We shall overcome.
Viva la revolucion!
Viva!
Muerte al fascismo!
Muerte!
Come on, sit down...
Friends...
Don Julian's house is now the house of the people.
Let's start the meeting.
Who's going to speak?
Teresa.
We must collectivise.
The men at the front have no food and the people in the village have been left with next to nothing by the fascists.
The village hasn't got enough food.
We must collectivise as soon as possible.
We must get food to feed our people and the comrades fighting for us at the front.
I'm in agreement with the collectivisation of Don Julian's lands or re-distribution in all its forms, but each to his own little bit...
no?
Wait...
Jose, speak.
I work my land my own way... it's not much, all that I have...
I started working it and... shit...
I've thrown everything into it.
Miguel.
What would you like to say?
I'd like to say to our friend here that it's very good that he wants to work his own land, but how much better it would be if we all worked it together.
When the harvest is ready, are you going to eat all the wheat and all the potatoes?
You are not to say so... we need everything to be able... to keep the revolution going.
The revolution has to be done this way.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
Jose, it's not only a question of land.
Hay que hacer una sociedad nueva!
Un momento, Miguel, que Aniceto habia...
Yo habia pedido la palabra, y a nosotros nos dejais de lado.
The revolution is like a pregnant cow, if we don't help out... the cow and its calf will be gone and the children will be left hungry.
Remember that comrades, boys, died in this battle.
We must collectivise.
Do you understand me?
The people must eat.
This struggle we've started has to continue.
There are those who are the way they are and there are those who know how to work and people who don't...
I've got what I've got because I work.
Hold on.
Paco's turn.
It's fundamental that improve our harvests... we must grow more.
Other villages have done it by working all the land as one.
With a tractor you can do five times more work in one day than you can with a mule.
Un momento.
No hablemos todos juntos.
Un momento.
Sebastian.
There's evidence from other villages that it's working.
I believe we have to take over private property.
No one's got anything.
We could pool all our resources and depending on each person's situation we could share it out.
If you need a cow, you'll get one.
We've all got four or five kids... and we've all bust a gut working, just like you.
Hey!
Momento!
Momento, companeros... we've got militia comrades here who may know what's happening elsewhere... they've helped us here.
Teresa...
Pepe's right.
Our friends from the militia will have seen what's happened in other villages.
This is an open meeting you can speak, too.
Your opinions are as welcome as any of ours.
Please speak.
It's your village.
You have to decide.
It's your decision.
Okay, this is what I think, and if anybody disagrees they should just say so right out.
Si.
Okay.
You should take this estate, this house, this land and divide it up amongst the people in the town right away.
Okay.
The decree passed by the Republican Government in October allows for that.
Okay.
It says all property owned by individuals involved in the insurrection will be confiscated.
Si, si.
The problem's different here... all the landowners help Franco.
We must collectivize all the lands.
You understand?
Todas las tierras, hay que colectivizar no solo dividir.
I understand that.
I understand that.
I'm not, I'm not a friend of the landowner.
Okay?
I'm not here to defend landowners.
Okay?
But what are you going to do when you have a guy like, what's his name, Pepe?
What are you going to do when you have a guy like Pepe who has... he's a tenant farmer and he has a couple of acres of land... or a tradesman who doesn't want to be part of your collective?
Okay?
These people are anti-fascists.
What do you do then?
It sounds really great on paper, but in reality it won't work... because it's going to pit the peasants against the anti-fascists.
Okay?
You're fighting now and it's going to endanger your food production.
Lawrence, I think that private ownership of land must be totally given up, forgotten, cancelled... because it maintains people in a capitalist mentality.
I agree.
Okay.
I agree with, I mean,
I'm not here to argue for, for private property.
I know the definition of private property.
I know what it does.
Okay, I'm not arguing that.
This is not the time for these textbook arguments on socialism or land reform.
We have to defeat fascism, that's the priority.
Are you suspecting this man to, to speak about the textbook of... socialism?
No, I'm not!
Well, I'm, I'm agreeing with him.
Okay?
I'm agreeing with the collectivisation, all right?
But these people cannot collectivise anything if they're dead.
Okay?
Well, this is, is your opinion.
My opinion!
They asked for my opinion.
No, but in my village, the people didn't wait for the government to give them the land.
They took it themselves.
Nadie espero a que les dijesen que tenian que hacer con la tierra, la cogieron ellos mismos.
I want you to think beyond this village, okay at a much bigger picture.
Okay.
I have no doubt that the Spanish people, on their own, could have 'licked' Franco.
But you're not fighting just Franco, you now have Mussolini and Hitler on your back.
Okay.
With the exception of Russia and Mexico... the rest of the world has turned its back on you.
Okay?
They refuse to sell the Republic arms.
Okay.
These are capitalists, these are capitalist countries!
They're capitalist countries, and if you want their help you have to moderate your slogans cos you're scaring them away!
I'm from Germany.
We wanted revolution and what happened?
We'd been the strongest movement in Europe... the best organised workers' movement.
There were six million of us in unions and what happened?
Hitler...
The socialists and the communists told us... to make our revolution later.
But I say make the revolution now.
When people see as the village sees that you can be in charge of your life, your land, when collectivisation becomes a reality, it'll be possible for people in Germany, Italy, to follow our example.
These people think they have, they think they have something, but they have nothing!
But we have to show to the people that, that we have... we're poor but we're alive and we've got power now, we don't have to be seized by fear.
We're alive, we'll die when our time comes, but...
All French working people are, are looking to us in Spain, probably all around the world and I think it is not the right time to fight, to fight each other but together.
Now all of us know the price of the freedom and we, we've lost a lot of friends.
Gene, your theories are very seductive but I've got one question for you.
Who are you trying to appease... foreign governments, foreign bankers?
What is a revolution?
It's nothing other than a radical change in privilege, wealth and power.
What's going to happen, what'...
the only way we'll appease, the only way we'll appease these people when the ideas are diluted and watered down till they mean absolutely nothing.
Now I think you're dead right when you say when you say that they must look beyond this village, and must look at what's happening outside.
Okay, but not only to foreign bankers and foreign governments.
What we must look to as well is that outside these windows, as we speak, on this land are two million landless peasants.
From the day they were born they had absolutely no hope other than a life of misery.
And unless we harness that energy now the ideas will be dead, there'll be no change and this will all be in vain.
Ideas are the basis of this.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, those people will be dead never mind the ideas!
If Franco comes in, you know, if Franco wins this war he'll just kill a million of those people.
They're nothing to him.
They're just a piece of shit!
That's obvious, I agree with that.
Exactly.
So, unless we win the war, there's no point in having the ideology.
The ideology does not exist in, in like, in a book.
It exists, has to exist in place.
It'd have to be real, for real people.
I say that we have to take risks.
What do we do?
Misery, hunger, hopelessness.
Franco might come back and kill us but I say it's worth it to continue collectivising and improving the quality of our lives.
Let's vote!
All those in favour of collectivisation.
All those against.
Friends, the vote is to collectivise the land.
You all right?
Want a hand?
Yeah.
I thought maybe your foot was hurtin'.
It's okay, thank you.
No problem.
Hola.
Hola.
And you talk about being poor.
Who?
You.
With Coogan that night.
We were just talking about when we were kids.
I tell you what poor is.
Two pesetas a day for agricultural labours if you're lucky.
Peasant families living in caves or sandpits that is poor.
That is why we need the revolution.
Don't laugh!
I'm not laughing.
I saw you!
I wasn't laughing!
D'you want a hand with that?
Oh, I can see you've got one.
Don't say any more!
What I'm saying, Kit, is that I'm not the man I was.
I feel like I'm standing on higher ground, if you see what I mean.
I can see further and, and I notice things I hadn't even thought of before.
Like I, I left Liverpool with a daft romantic idea but in war people get killed.
Fellas like Coogan... and the women and kids who died in this village that's all part of me now and I'll never shake it off.
Fascist planes dropped leaflets on us yesterday saying how they was winning the war.
Well, myself, it's hard to know what's going on in the rest of Spain.
But here, on the Aragon front, we're holding our own.
And if only we had decent arms.
Who knows?
Perhaps a line of Russian tanks will come rolling over the hill.
Some hope, eh?
Pigat, Garibaldi, Roca...
Listen...
Max...
Come here.
Companeros, listen please.
I have to go to the Command Post for a very important meeting with the General Staff of the Column.
And I say, very important because we are going to discuss about our integration in the new Popular Army.
There is no choice.
The government in Valencia says no more militia and say we all must become part in the new communist led Popular Army.
Okay?
So, if we refuse they continue to withhold arms.
To keep arms from us.
Do you understand?
Let's take a vote, no?
Votamos?
I have something to say, please.
Please.
Excuse me a moment, please.
This is probably the last time that we can vote on something as a militia.
All right?
Please.
Maybe we could integrate to the new Popular Army and get the weapons join together and be still in the militia too.
You're a dreamer, Pigat.
It's impossible.
Look, I think we have, we have to try to see the reality of the situation here.
Okay?
Who's ever gonna give us guns, the Russians or whomever they're not going to give them to us if they don't think that we know how to use them and that we're not properly trained.
So it makes sense that the best training is going to come from a regular disciplined army.
That's obvious.
I can't see what's wrong with that at all.
Everything is wrong.
The creation of the new army with its saluting and discipline and military hierarchy will destroy the revolutionary spirit of the people.
Okay?
And it's exactly what Stalinists expect.
What?
That makes no sense, Bernard.
Absolutely.
The Communist Party was set up for revolution.
Why would they want to suppress the revolutionary spirit?
It is no more revolutionary.
Look, the militia is the heart of the struggle.
Stalin fears us because he wants to sign treaties with the west and he already did, did it with France.
So, to sign treaties, to reach an agreement... he needs to be respectable and reassuring.
Okay?
So, if he supports us and the revolution we are making... he will lost his... respectability.
That's the reason why we are a real threat for Stalin and also for the other countries.
I don't know, Bernard, I... what you are saying might be right, I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay.
But I do know we're not going to win this war with a bunch of amateurs.
You may be an amateur, I'm not!
Jesus Christ!
We've done, we've done okay up, up to now, Gene.
We could have done better with guns.
We saved Valencia, Madrid, Barcelona... and we lost Toledo, Malaga and more... we've got to be clear about one thing here.
There's blackmail going on.
If we accept those arms, they come with conditions.
They're not interested in partners, they want stooges.
Let's vote...
Let them know what we think.
Do we support our General Stafe when they insist on keeping our own revolutionary organisations?
Si?
Everybody?
Si.
It's a clear majority.
Now watch.
Put the bullet in here.
Yes?
Understand?
That's it.
You take off the catch and it's ready for firing.
Si...
Come on then, "Mr Laurel".
Remarkable resemblance.
Remarkable.
Even down to the blank expression.
There you go.
You need to hold the rifle harder against your shoulder.
Fire.
Whey!
How's your shoulder?
You're afraid of the rifle.
Si.
Yes.
Hold it firmly like this.
You mustn't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze it like a woman's tits.
Understand?
Have you ever squeezed a woman's tits?
Yeah.
Yes?
I'll bet you have.
Hold on a minute.
Fuck!
Come quickly.
I know.
Are you okay?
Get a stick.
A stick!
Hey, hey, try to keep calm.
Is he all right?
Yeah, yeah!
I'm all right!
We must get him to the hospital.
What happened?
What happened?
Fucking rifle blew up in my face.
Jesus!
Piece of shit!
Jesus!
Are you satisfied now?
This is the shitty equipment you voted for!
Don't you have anything better to say?
Please give him some peace.
Don't you see?
Yeah, I can see.
I see a stupid idealist with a death wish.
Can't you see what's going on here?
It's over!
It's kaput!
It's finished.
Jesus, easy, easy man!
Oh fuck!
I've had it!
I cannot stay here watching people die of stupidity!
I can't do it!
I've had it!
I'm getting out of this!
Fuck it!
David, if you had any fucking brains you'd do the exact same thing!
Davey, let me see your eyes.
Are your eyes okay?
Yeah.
Oh, you daft bastard!
How's that?
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
Easy...
How far is this place?
About four miles.
They patch you up and send you to the hospital in Barcelona.
When you get out of the hospital... you'll need somewhere to rest for a while before you come back.
Yeah.
I know a place, a pension in Barcelona where the people from the POUM stay.
Would you like the address?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.
You stay there yourself, this pension?
Yeah, sometimes.
I know the old lady.
You stay there.
Tell her my name.
I will.
I'll say: "Blanca sent me.
Can you give me a nice room, please?".
Look after yourself, Blanca.
I'll see you soon.
Is this boarding house around here?
The Pension Adela?
Hello.
Do you have a room for me?
Who are you?
My friend Blanca sent me...
I like having English people, they are clean and tidy.
This is my room?
This is yours.
Si.
Hola.
Hello.
How are you?
Great.
What are you doing here?
You're not pleased to see me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just shocked.
How's your arm?
Oh, it's much better now.
I had the stitches taken out two days ago.
What are you doing here?
Bernard gave me seven days leave.
I thought I would surprise you.
You definitely have, without doubt.
I bought some wine.
It's on the table.
I'll be with you in a minute.
All right, yeah.
Help yourself.
Pour a glass for me.
Si, claro!
Please.
How's Bernard?
He's fine.
You know.
Women aren't allowed to fight any more.
New rules.
Yeah, I heard.
I can be a nurse.
I can drive a truck.
I can be a cook.
But I mustn't shoot a gun any more.
I must know my place as a woman.
Maite is going to be a cook.
No!
Yes.
She will... she will be the worst in the militia.
Well that's without doubt.
It doesn't sound at all like her.
Things are changing very quickly.
Yeah?
What did Vidal say about the whole thing?
No... please.
I don't want to talk about it.
All right.
Today I want to forget it all... bullets, trenches... politics, killings, betrayals.
I want to feel human for a change.
Salut.
Salut.
Take off your shirt.
What?
Come on.
Take off your shirt!
All right, all right.
All right.
It's got buttons, you know.
Take care.
What's going on?
The police from the old days.
And now they are back.
No guns for us at the front... and here in Barcelona the police have guns sticking out of their arse.
I'll make some coffee.
Do you have some matches?
What?
No matches.
Yeah, there's some matches in my bag.
What is this?
What?
This?
We get no uniforms like this in the militia.
Look...
I meant to tell you.
I'm not in the militia any more.
I've joined the International Brigade.
I leave for Albacete on Friday.
Stalinist!
Come on.
Come on.
You vote!
You vote to keep the militia!
Yeah, but... things are different now.
I've changed my mind.
It's because of Lawrence?
No!
He left the day after!
No, it's not because of that!
I'm a member of the Communist Party.
I've never hidden it.
But you fought with us!
With the POUM!
Yeah, I fought with the POUM.
And look at the fuck that happened to me.
I've got a big piece of metal in my arm.
But you know perfectly well why!
You know they refuse us arms!
David!
The Stalinists are betraying the revolution!
I don't believe that.
Go to La Batalla.
Talk to them there.
I haven't got to talk to La Batalla.
I've been in hospital, I was talking to others.
Our leaders have been expelled from the government.
That's politics.
That's the way politics works.
No!
They are trying to ban us.
Say we are, we are social fascists!
And you know, you know this!
You know our papers are banned, journalists arrested and here they even talk about torture chambers.
Camaras de tortura!
I don't know that, do I?
I'll wait till I see it with my own eyes.
But you don't see it!
You don't want to see it.
Why you didn't tell me yesterday?
I was going to tell you.
I meant to tell you, just...
Liar!
Come on, look.
I've tried but...
Blanca...
I came to Spain to fight for socialism, to fight for the Republic!
And the best way I can think to do that is with the International Brigades.
And if, if what you're saying is true then I'm sure there's a good reason.
There's an explanation of some sort.
Of course it's true!
And there is an explanation.
It's called Stalinism!
Look, what are you going to do now?
I go back to the front, where my real comrades are.
Oh look, come on!
Blanca!
For fucks sake, Blanca.
Listen!
Blanca!
Look after yourself, will ya?
Please.
(GERMAN EAGLES ON GUERNICA BOMBS)
So that's why I'm in Barcelona.
It's dead complicated, Kit, and difficult to explain.
The problem is the struggle seems to be falling apart in front of our eyes.
No-one trusts anyone any more.
Anarchists and POUM are pulling one way, communists in another.
It's mad.
All I can do is believe the Party.
They must know what they're doing.
JOINT PLANS TO BREAK MADRID FRONT
The city is like a powder keg waiting to go off.
Trucks of assault guards everywhere.
And now there's trouble at the telephone exchange which is run by the anarchists.
The police just took it by force.
They say the anarchists are sabotaging the war effort by interfering with government business.
There's fighting in the streets, barricades going up all over the place.
There's shootings.
Comrades against comrades.
Fascist must be laugh that, that's all.
David.
The attack of the telephone exchange is a declaration of war against the working class... what are the POUM up to?
A general strike has been called in all industries except those producing weapons...
Plants, machine shops, warehouses... are stopping work.
The barricades of liberty have risen again in every part of town!
Arm yourselves to defend the revolution!
You should be killing fascists not one another!
What are you saying?
We've got nothing to eat.
D'you hear?
We've got to put food on the table.
Please get out of the way.
Sorry, friend.
I'm sorry.
Bastards!
Hey, you, Stalin's sidekick.
What division were you in?
The Karl Marx Division.
And you?
The Third Division?
No, you bastard.
We're from the Durutti Division, the best.
You don't even know who's your enemy.
You idiots!
You idiots!
You have betrayed the revolution.
That's a lie.
You are the ones who have broken the anti-fascists front.
I've been at the front and I know.
Are you English?
Yeah.
You?
Where are you from?
Manchester.
Fucking hell, I'm from Liverpool.
What you doin' here?
Don't know.
Why aren't you over here with us?
Why aren't you over here with us?
I don't fucking know.
We can smell food, fascists.
What are you cooking, bastards?
Sausages and beans.
Are you hungry?
You bet!
Then here you are.
No more.
Never.
We're not enemies.
My friend, Martin, returned from the front dying of hunger.
It's a disaster.
Which front?
Aragon.
When it's decision time, everyone is the boss.
They say they don't even know how to load the guns.
Get away!
They say the militia women aren't killing fascists, they are fucking them instead!
They fuck them.
They do nothing.
They're crap.
They're a disaster, they take 4 totally inexperienced men.
That's a lie.
I'm from the front.
I'm in the militia.
You're in the militia?
You're in the militia?
He can't even speak properly.
What?
What are you saying?
Listen, you're a fucking kid.
You know fuck all.
Do you understand me?
Yes, a kid.
You don't know nothing.
You've seen fuck all.
What's going on?
Son of a bitch!
Quiet!
You fucking know-nothing, you little snotty-nosed little kid!
What's going on?
That's enough.
Are you mad, or what?
What do you think is going on?
If the leaders of the POUM and CNT get together, we're fucked.
That's what's happening!
They need to come from abroad to tell us that?
At least it's good that they're here.
Lazarus.
Yeah.
Back from the dead.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Gone but not forgotten, eh?
Has vuelto?
Si.
Roca!
Andres!
Que tal amigo?
Yeah.
Are you a spy of the communists?
Si.
Fucking English.
You're welcome.
Good to see you.
We have a new cook now.
Maite!
Maite!
Fucking shit, the woman's doing the cooking...
Hola, amigo!
David!
David!
Si!
What are you doing here?
I came back for something to eat.
Oh great!
I heard you'd taken over the cooking.
No, seriously, what happened?
No, seriously, what's on the menu?
Seriously...
Fucking beans!
Go to hell, Pigat.
It's terrible!
Hola.
Fine.
And you?
So so.
What are you doing here?
I'm glad to see you again.
Si, si.
Yo tambien.
The party stinks, Kit.
And I never thought the day'd come when I'd have to say that.
It's evil and corrupt.
In Barcelona I saw good comrades snatched off the streets and executed others disappeared into torture chambers, and it's still going on.
Stalin is just using the working class like pieces on a chessboard to be bartered, used and sacrificed.
Things have changed while I've been away.
Some of the old faces are missing because they couldn't stomach all the in-fighting and all-in-all we've taken a bit of a battering.
It's rumoured we're going to make a big attack soon and still no weapons, no support.
But this one we're going to win.
Despite everything, our spirits are high.
Keep cover!
Viva!
Medico!
Medico!
We have had many casualties.
They're bombing us...
Liste... where's the cover you promised?
What kind of position is this?
Nobody's come.
You don't understand anything.
Nobody's come.
We can't hold on.
Those fucking Stalinist bastards.
This should have been over hours ago, mate.
They should have fucking taken that hill hours ago.
Trust them just to make a fucking point.
They've dumped us, Davey!
Madruga.
Si...
Ammunition!
Wait...
I'm waiting!
I'm not going anywhere, am I?
See we're hemmed in here, mate.
They know where we are.
Where are they?
Where's the asaltos?
Never mind in fucking reserve!
We're fucked here... we can't hold this position any longer.
We must stay here.
No.
We can't.
We don't have any weapons.
We don't have... we must show them what we are, Bernard.
Listen, they know exactly what's happening here.
Nobody's sending arms or the army.
We will die alone, here, and you will do their game.
We are fighters.
Bernard, we are fighters!
It's an order.
We're fucked here...
This is madness.
You've got to hold on.
Yes, sir.
Retreat immediately.
Why are you giving me this order when you've just told me to hold the position?
All right?
I also want to know...
listen... why we've been risking our lives here waiting for the promised reinforcements.
All right?
Whatever you say, sir.
Madruga, Andres, come here and the rest, quickly.
Garibaldi, Roca, we're going back to our old positions.
Come on, Roca.
Bernard, to the left with Jimmy.
David, cover this flank.
Come on!
Quickly, orderly, orderly...
go with them...
Come on, David.
All of you get back.
Come on... back...
Come on...
My fucking leg!
Blanca, come here.
Orderly.
Orderly, there's a bad one, quick!
Stay with them.
Come on, Jimmy!
Be brave.
Oh, my leg!
Mira, mira, the cavalry have come.
If they've come to fight, they're a bit late for that one, aren't they?
Hey, Gene.
Gene!
Gene... what are you doing here?
Gene, what are you doing here?
Take it easy.
Bernard, keep everybody calm.
Stay where you are!
Quiet, everybody.
What the hell's going on?
Listen.
Drop your weapons on the ground, immediately.
Obey the order!
What's going on, Lawrence?
Listen.
Es una orden.
What's the meaning of this?
Can we know why?
Officer, get your men to obey.
I refuse.
Obey my orders!
From now on this unit is disbanded.
You can all go home, except for the following who are under arrest.
Quiet!
Juan Vidal
Bernard Goujon
Miguel Angel Campos
Rafael Jimenez
Ni locos... what are we accused of?
The POUM is now illegal.
Your newspaper has been banned and your leaders arrested.
What charges?
Conspiring with the fascists... collaborating with Franco!
Is this conspiracy?
Is this conspiracy, Colonel?
Jesus!
It's a lie... it's a lie... while we've been getting fucking shot...
Don't look at the ground look at me face to face.
It's not a reflection on you it's your leaders.
It's a Stalinist plot.
The fucking government's a load of bollocks!
Sietamo, what about Sietamo?
Alcubierre?
Come on, Gene, what about the people...
Lecinena?
Casetas de Quisena?
Tierz?
Navales?
They're all places liberated by the POUM.
Were they fascists who did that?
What about fucking Coogan and the others, who died?
Are we all fascists all of a sudden?
Were these places liberated by fascists, too?
It was the men of the POUM who defended Madrid.
Were these places liberated by Franco?
Quiet!
Obey my orders!
Prepare to fire!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
Quiet!
What shall we do with the wounded?
Madruga, quiet!
You're under arrest.
Do as he says.
What happened in Barcelona with our comrades?
Murderers!
They're going to shoot you...
Murderers!
Control your men, Captain.
Control your men, Captain.
Fight with us against fascism.
Fascist bastard, come here and say that face to face with us.
Come here.
Coward, coward, come here.
Blanca!
They have to do this.
Come here.
Coward, come here!
They have to do this.
You're being tricked.
You're being tricked by your own leaders!
You're being lied to!
Fight with us.
They're tricking you.
You are tricking us!
No, the leaders of the POUM are tricking you!
You are tricking us!
Lawrence, open your eyes!
Come here, coward.
They have proof.
Come here!
Come here!
Blanca...!
Silence...
You idiots.
God Almighty!
Silence...
Murderers...
Vidal... what the fuck did you do that for?
We've fought for nothing, comrades.
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
You bastards...
Murderers...
Murderers... we've fought for nothing, comrades.
Lower your guns.
Death to Stalinism!
Long live the revolution...
Open your eyes!
Long live the revolution.
Down with fascism.
Thank you very much.
We buried Blanca in collectivised land.
She would have liked that... even though the Stalinists came four weeks later and broke up the commune.
At least the earth belonged to her for a short while.
I'm trying to get home, Kit, but it won't be easy.
They have a "wanted" list ad, as a so-called deserter and supporter of the POUM, my name's on it.
There are no "safe" houses and we spend our time hiding out in building sites and living rough.
Some of the most sincere and dedicated fighters against fascism have been murdered.
But if you get this letter... understand that I regret nothing.
Revolutions are contagious, and had we succeeded here... and we could have done.
We would have changed the world.
But never mind... our day will come.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many, but we are more... we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
Can I just say something a minute?
The other day, I found this.
It was amongst, like, my grandad's papers.
And I just thought it was, like, fitting for him.
It's a poem by William Morris, and I'd just like to read it out.
"Join in the battle"
"wherein no man can fail"
"For whoso fadeth and dieth"
"Yet his deeds shall all still prevail"
Wouldn't be on the first floor, would it?
Ambulance!
Yeah.
Yeah, here you are, love.
In 'ere.
It's the old fella.
He's collapsed on the couch.
Let's have a look at him, eh?
This is his grand-daughter.
You were here when this happened, were you?
Yeah, I just come in and found him on the couch.
What's his name?
Dave Carr.
Dave!
Dave!
Is he gonna be all right?
Dave?
Dave?
No response there, Dave.
No response, yeah...
How's he doing, love?
He's okay at the moment so let's just keep our fingers crossed.
Does he have any other close relatives at all?
There's my mum.
She lives in Wales, so, I mean, she doesn't see him often
Her and me dad have split up.
Paul, make the hospital.
He's just gone on us, mate.
Oh, God!
Have we lost him?
Oh, God, Dot!
It's all right...

(SPANISH TROOPS REVOLT IN MOROCCO)
(THE DAILY WORKER)
(ALL INTO ACTION NOW!
DEFEND SPANISH REPUBLIC!
)
In February a coalition of socialist, republican and other left wing parties were victorious in the general election.
They proposed a series of democratic reforms.
The big landowners, industrialists, churchmen and army officers feared the growing power of the working class.
July 18th.
There was a military uprising led by the Fascist General Franco against the democratically elected government.
Government supporters formed militias to defend themselves.
Organised by trades unions and political parties, they went to fight for their democratic rights against the Fascists.
This, this is... this is the... one of the militias going to the Zaragosa front in, in Aragon.
You can see all the cars.
They've got the name of the workers' organisation... because they've all been nationalised, they've all been taken over by the workers.
That is the Union of, of the Railway workers.
This is the CNT... the anarchists' union.
As you can see... the support the whole of Barcelona is on the streets but with very few guns.
Most people haven't got guns.
You can see young, old, men, women.
These are the fascists.
The General, the defenders of privilege.
And this is what they are doing to us.
They are killed and left there... just for being trade unionists.
Every defeat for us is a defeat for you.
Every step that takes Franco closer to poser in Spain also takes the fascists closer to power here.
If Franco wins the war... it would be a major boost for fascists everywhere.
And before long, comrades... they will drag all freedom-loving people down to barbarism and, and war.
Comrades, whether Spanish or English, or American or Chinese we are one class of people with the same aspiration... the same hope for a just and equal society.
I want you to join with us... make our fight your fight.
Let's come together... let's come together...
Let's take up the slogan.
No Pasaran.
They shall not pass.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
You've got our support.
We're right behind you.
We wanna fight.
No Pasaran.
Kit...
I'm going to go to Spain.
What, just like that you're going to Spain?
Well, not just like that but...
It'll take a while to organise.
I'll go to Barcelona, sort it out from there.
Why you?
Why have you got to go?
Because I can.
I haven't got any kids or nothing.
I mean, you know... what am I doing here, Kit?
I'm on fifteen bob a week on the dole.
Y'know, there's millions of us, out of work.
I'm on, you know, demonstrations, hunger marches just...
I know.
I've been there with you.
I know.
But I want to do something.
And you can't do it here?
If we've got to do it, we've got to do it now.
We've got to stop them otherwise it's not, it's going to be too late, Kit.
We'll have no future here.
I can't spare you.
Come here.
Dear Kit... well I made it.
It was a bit tricky and the sea was rough.
I was glad to get off that ship.
But Larry, who smuggled me aboard, turned up trumps.
He got us ashore, in one piece, at Marseilles... and put us on the road to Spain.
And then I hitched a lift in a couple of lorries to the border.
It seems there's no organisation here to help volunteers like me you've just got to make your own way.
With no passport, crossing the frontier wasn't easy and I had to walk across the Pyrenees.
I must have climbed for miles.
My boots are all shot to pieces and my feet are steaming.
I was scared stiff but we made it.
Would you like to sit down?
Would you like to sit down?
Madam, could you please move the chickens?
Now I'm in Spain and everything is so bright it hurts your eyes.
I've 'copped' the train for Barcelona.
Maybe I'll see some action.
He said that they could use your feet as a weapon against Franco.
What do you do here?
Oh, I've come to fight for the Republic.
Good.
The more that come the sooner we'll win.
Do you want a drop?
Thanks.
Salud!
Gracias.
Smoke?
Smoke?
Oh, with pleasure.
My name is Bernard.
Bernard Goujon.
Pleased to meet you.
David Carr.
Bernard.
D'you smoke, lads?
Do you have papers, documentation?
Yeah, I've got my Party card.
My Com, Communist Party of Great Britain membership.
Yeah, I've got it here.
Look, it's like that.
See.
It's for a comrade of the POUM.
The what?
The POUM, P-O-U-M
Never heard of that?
No, never heard of the POUM.
It's Spanish workers' Party.
Revolutionaries.
Tickets, please.
He's with us, boss.
He's come to fight the fascists.
Welcome in Spain.
Thanks very much.
The Trade Union is controlling all the line.
Thanks.
Thanks.
So it's a present for you.
Oh, don't have to pay?
No, no, don't have to pay.
Thanks very much.
Thanks, comrade.
Gracias.
Left, right, left, right...
Alto!
Halt!
Turn to right.
Alto!
Turn to right.
Alto!
Hey, dickhead.
Make up your mind.
Shut up.
I'm in charge here.
I'm pissed off with this.
This is important pick it up immediately.
You pick it up.
I'm off.
Where are you going, love?
Don't call me "love".
Comrade, comrade...
I am going to Madrid.
Understand?
They take things seriously there.
This is vital for the revolution for both men and women.
We've got to have discipline we'll never win without it.
Where are we going going to get to with this...
This is just the beginning.
I want a gun.
You'll get to fight...
Please trust me...
Get back in the line... what are you lot gawking at?
Let's have some energy.
I've seen more life in a sick note.
Right!
Halt!
In Germany I was a pastry cook.
Pastry...
Yeah, pastry cook.
And you, Gene, what was your job?
Eleven years on the sea.
Bosun.
Bosun?
Yes.
I've just spent six days on the sea and it was not for me.
I was, went from Liverpool to Marseilles and I was sick all the time.
So...
I'm not a sailor.
I was a servant.
A cleaner.
Servant.
For an English family.
On the first day everything starts they went running to England so they left, they left me alone in Barcelona.
I'm free for the first time of my life.
Salud, camaradas.
Thank you, thank you.
You got the weapons?
Yes.
Antiques.
Antiques?
German, Mauser, 1896.
Single load.
How many?
Thirty.
Okay.
All right.
Be better using a big stick.
Okay.
Get these off and take them over there into the 'store place'.
When did you learn about guns?
Five years in French Army, I was sergeant.
Comrade.
Where you from?
Italiano.
Milano.
Italiano?
So you know fascism?
They're bastards.
Que?
Do you need some help?
No, I'll do it myself.
Vale, leona.
Aye, aye, soft ollies.
Are you taking the piss?
Want to change?
Come here!
Sit down.
Sit down, please.
Garibaldi, come here.
My name's Rafael Poccetti, Captain.
I know.
But I need Garibaldis more than I need Poccettis.
Sit down, please.
Leona, tu tambien.
Okay.
In the other side of the hill are the trenches.
Our trenches.
And beyond them is the enemy.
And the only good soldier in Franco's Army is a dead one.
My name is Vidal and I'm your Captain.
We are the POUM and we organise this section of the, of the front.
To the west of us are the anarchists.
And we fight together, comrades in arms to defeat, to destroy the fascists and make the workers' and peasants' revolution.
Understand?
Don't forget it.
You are welcome here because you are my speaking squad English.
Okay?
We are proud to have you fight with us in our side.
Hey, David...
look.
The whores are also at the front.
Yeah, but they're better looking than the ones back home.
Yeah?
Good morning, Coogan, your reinforcements are here now.
I thought it was Sunday.
Dear Kit.
Well, I'm a soldier now with the POUM Militia.
It's a People's Army.
Just ordinary men and women fighting for a cause not like the Army back home.
There's no saluting'.
We elect the officers, and everything's discussed and voted on
It's socialism in action.
I'm in a special section... it's mainly internationals but some Spainish... and the common language is English, so we get by.
An Irishman called Coogan is in charge.
We're all on the same pay ten pesetas a day which is kept for us for when we go on leave.
And we also get a packet of fags a day, which isn't bad.
It's a huge operation, about twenty thousand militia on this front alone.
I'm not in the communist brigade, but it doesn't matter cos we're all fightin' the same enemy.
Viva Franco!
Viva Espana!
Fascists bastards.
Rot in hell!
Sons of bitches!
Fascists, you've got no balls.
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse.
Hey, rich bastard, you'll die with nothing.
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse!
You must be used to this weather coming from your godforsaken town.
It never stops fuckin' raining!
You been, have you?
Yeah, five years, Manchester.
Staring at the poxy rain through prison bars.
What d'you get put down for?
Fightin' the Brits.
Murderer...
Murderer of a free nation.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
There's all sorts here...
French, German, Yanks, Spanish of course, and a Scot by the name of Jimmy.
All good lads.
The front line doesn't seem to move.
We watch the fascists, and they watch us.
Lots of hanging about waiting' for something to happen.
Digging trenches, going out on patrol, sentry duty.
But worst of all is the lice.
They're worse than the nits back home.
They send you mad.
They lay their eggs in the lining of your trousers and you can't get rid of 'em.
You're forever scratching.
The food's not great... it's usually bread and beans which gives us all a problem...
I could murder some cabbage and ribs.
The local women do the cooking.
It's strange to see women in the trenches fighting alongside the men.
But no need to worry, Kit, none of them could hold a candle to you.
Max...
You know what we said the other day when we came down... about Blanca being a whore.
You know, a prostitute.
Who?
Who?
Who?
You said that Blanca was a prostitute - a whore!
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Good one.
Good one?
Good one!
Yeah!
Yours are winding me up.
Everybody knows... except you.
Maite...?
True.
You know, David, Blanca has told me some stories... crazy ones.
Hard life...
Hard life... hard one!
In fact, Jose can tell you, you know.
He knows her very well, you konw, because...
She knows how to do it... she's good and cheap.
Good and cheap, yeah.
Leave him alone.
David, it's the right moment.
Listen, she likes you, I tell you.
Good luck!
All right?
Yeah.
Do you want a cigarette?
No, thanks.
So, I mean, I was just thinking if you're not busy later on you might want to... you know, go for a walk with me.
You know...
I don't understand you.
Maybe me and you, you know, like... with, with Coogan.
When we saw you the other day...
Coogan is my man.
D'you understand?
Yeah.
Si.
Before the war we live together.
We join in the militia together.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got...
we fight together.
Sorry about that.
Sorry.
Yeah.
I'll see you later then.
You shower of bastards!
You...
I'll have a fuckin' word with you in a minute!
Have a nice time?
Have a nice time?
Yes, I did, thank you very much.
Marcel!
David?
Look.
Uh?
Fascist prisoners.
No!
An officer as well.
How many?
Besides the officer, there's...
Lawrence, Coogan, Jimmy.
I wonder where they found them?
I dunno.
This fucking senora wants a word with you.
Him and his sons, we found them behind the lines.
Doing a recce or something.
Anyway, they were lost.
At ease.
What's your name, lad?
Jose.
Jose?
Are you hungry?
Take them and get them something to eat, Jim.
And where are you going?
I've some questions for you.
I don't have to answer.
I'm a professional soldier.
Support the government elected by the people.
It's not a real government.
Muy bien...
How many soldiers in your command?
Have you got machine-guns?
Artillery?
Do your soldiers obey you?
Of course... we're a real army.
(FRANCO CLAIMS MALAGA MANY KILLED AT MADRID)

Mail.
No.
No.
No.
Sorry.
Coogan, over here.
Oh, great.
Pigat...
Are you alright?
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Leave me alone.
I want to go home.
What's wrong?
I'm going home, okay?
Why?
I've got things to sort out.
You're crazy... you can't just leave like this.
I came here willingly and I'll leave when I feel like it, okay?
No, it's not that easy.
You can't just go when you want to.
There's a discipline here.
My woman's fucking another man.
Who'll sort it out?
You?
Vidal?
Okay.
What are you going to do?
String the son of a bitch up by his balls.
And what good would that do?
Tell me, what good would that do?
Make me feel better.
Stay here... with your companeros.
I came here for her, for my daughter, the future.
You've got a daughter?
She was two last month.
What's her name?
Lidia.
Look...
If we don't win this war there'll be no future for anybody.
Right?
Not for Lidia, not for your wife, not you, not me, not anyone.
Do you understand?
The photos'll give you some idea of how cold it was.
But what they don't show is how the rain turned everything into freezing mud.
We seemed to spend all our time searching for firewood anything that'd burn and keep us warm.
This Coogan fella's a bit of a wild one.
Ex-IRA.
He's always first on patrol and last one back.
He knows what he's doing, but he does take chances.
His girlfriend's called Blanca.
She's in our section.
She's a bit of a character an' all.
Sharp as a razor.
They're not always hanging on to one another, but everyone knows they're a couple.
The worst thing about being here is doing nothing.
It seems we're just sittin' around and talkin' and arguing' politics all the time.
I come all this way to fight fascists and I can't get to grips with them.
Still... at last things are warming up a bit, not just the weather either.
Tomorrow's a big day.
We're attacking a village held by the fascists.
Think of us.
Lots of love, David.
Take off your sacks!
Vamos alla, valientes!
David, come on!
What's going on?
No!
No!
Chuck us a cartridge.
Hey, chuck us a fucking cartridge!
There's women down there!
Danny, you can't be serious.
Give us a fucking cartridge!
Danny, you can't put their lives in danger.
Coogan!
Coogan!
Fuego!
Don't shoot!
Speak to me!
Speak to me.
Speak to me!
This is the pig that was shooting from the tower.
Quiet!
Su rifle aun esta caliente.
I'm going to ask one simple question.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
Tell me the truth.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
There's the proof.
What's this then?
Kill him!
He informed on five comrades from the Union, and they're dead now.
Yeah, kill him.
What happened?
They took my husband and shaved my head.
Why?
Why?
Because my husband was in the militia.
Y no lo pudieren coger.
Eran anarquistas.
They were young anarchists.
Somebody say to the priest in confession where they were.
He told this to the fascists.
He knew the fascists kill them.
Murderer!
We've got to kill him.
Delato a nuestros companeros!
And we'll see you in three days...
Two or three days.
I'll stay here with twenty men for three days.
Very nice indeed.
Very nice.
I'm happy you appreciate French good taste.
Hola chico!
Gracias, amiga.
Blanca...
I just want you to know how sorry I am for what happened.
I should have opened fire but I didn't and, and they got him.
That's all there is to it.
The thing is, he was a good man.
You know, he was a brave man.
We're all going to miss him.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I...
Oh, come on... come on... when I met him the first time... he was playing... how do you say...
The guitar?
No.
Yeah, the smaller one.
Banjo?
Yeah.
He was playing banjo.
In bars and cafes.
I'm sorry, Blanca, you know, it's my fault.
And I...
No.
No, I'm...
I'm responsible because...
No.
You didn't kill him.
Fascists did.
He said he just wanted, like, bullets and I said that, like, I wouldn't...
It could have happened sooner or later to any of us.
We feel a great sorrow today, but it must not halt our efforts.
Our companions have not died in vain.
Josefina, Sebastian, Teresa all of you we all fight for the same things as they did.
And we shall continue it's what they would have wanted.
They're here with us, fighting for the same cause.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many.
But we are more, we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
The struggle goes on.
They shall no pass.
We shall overcome.
Viva la revolucion!
Viva!
Muerte al fascismo!
Muerte!
Come on, sit down...
Friends...
Don Julian's house is now the house of the people.
Let's start the meeting.
Who's going to speak?
Teresa.
We must collectivise.
The men at the front have no food and the people in the village have been left with next to nothing by the fascists.
The village hasn't got enough food.
We must collectivise as soon as possible.
We must get food to feed our people and the comrades fighting for us at the front.
I'm in agreement with the collectivisation of Don Julian's lands or re-distribution in all its forms, but each to his own little bit...
no?
Wait...
Jose, speak.
I work my land my own way... it's not much, all that I have...
I started working it and... shit...
I've thrown everything into it.
Miguel.
What would you like to say?
I'd like to say to our friend here that it's very good that he wants to work his own land, but how much better it would be if we all worked it together.
When the harvest is ready, are you going to eat all the wheat and all the potatoes?
You are not to say so... we need everything to be able... to keep the revolution going.
The revolution has to be done this way.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
Jose, it's not only a question of land.
Hay que hacer una sociedad nueva!
Un momento, Miguel, que Aniceto habia...
Yo habia pedido la palabra, y a nosotros nos dejais de lado.
The revolution is like a pregnant cow, if we don't help out... the cow and its calf will be gone and the children will be left hungry.
Remember that comrades, boys, died in this battle.
We must collectivise.
Do you understand me?
The people must eat.
This struggle we've started has to continue.
There are those who are the way they are and there are those who know how to work and people who don't...
I've got what I've got because I work.
Hold on.
Paco's turn.
It's fundamental that improve our harvests... we must grow more.
Other villages have done it by working all the land as one.
With a tractor you can do five times more work in one day than you can with a mule.
Un momento.
No hablemos todos juntos.
Un momento.
Sebastian.
There's evidence from other villages that it's working.
I believe we have to take over private property.
No one's got anything.
We could pool all our resources and depending on each person's situation we could share it out.
If you need a cow, you'll get one.
We've all got four or five kids... and we've all bust a gut working, just like you.
Hey!
Momento!
Momento, companeros... we've got militia comrades here who may know what's happening elsewhere... they've helped us here.
Teresa...
Pepe's right.
Our friends from the militia will have seen what's happened in other villages.
This is an open meeting you can speak, too.
Your opinions are as welcome as any of ours.
Please speak.
It's your village.
You have to decide.
It's your decision.
Okay, this is what I think, and if anybody disagrees they should just say so right out.
Si.
Okay.
You should take this estate, this house, this land and divide it up amongst the people in the town right away.
Okay.
The decree passed by the Republican Government in October allows for that.
Okay.
It says all property owned by individuals involved in the insurrection will be confiscated.
Si, si.
The problem's different here... all the landowners help Franco.
We must collectivize all the lands.
You understand?
Todas las tierras, hay que colectivizar no solo dividir.
I understand that.
I understand that.
I'm not, I'm not a friend of the landowner.
Okay?
I'm not here to defend landowners.
Okay?
But what are you going to do when you have a guy like, what's his name, Pepe?
What are you going to do when you have a guy like Pepe who has... he's a tenant farmer and he has a couple of acres of land... or a tradesman who doesn't want to be part of your collective?
Okay?
These people are anti-fascists.
What do you do then?
It sounds really great on paper, but in reality it won't work... because it's going to pit the peasants against the anti-fascists.
Okay?
You're fighting now and it's going to endanger your food production.
Lawrence, I think that private ownership of land must be totally given up, forgotten, cancelled... because it maintains people in a capitalist mentality.
I agree.
Okay.
I agree with, I mean,
I'm not here to argue for, for private property.
I know the definition of private property.
I know what it does.
Okay, I'm not arguing that.
This is not the time for these textbook arguments on socialism or land reform.
We have to defeat fascism, that's the priority.
Are you suspecting this man to, to speak about the textbook of... socialism?
No, I'm not!
Well, I'm, I'm agreeing with him.
Okay?
I'm agreeing with the collectivisation, all right?
But these people cannot collectivise anything if they're dead.
Okay?
Well, this is, is your opinion.
My opinion!
They asked for my opinion.
No, but in my village, the people didn't wait for the government to give them the land.
They took it themselves.
Nadie espero a que les dijesen que tenian que hacer con la tierra, la cogieron ellos mismos.
I want you to think beyond this village, okay at a much bigger picture.
Okay.
I have no doubt that the Spanish people, on their own, could have 'licked' Franco.
But you're not fighting just Franco, you now have Mussolini and Hitler on your back.
Okay.
With the exception of Russia and Mexico... the rest of the world has turned its back on you.
Okay?
They refuse to sell the Republic arms.
Okay.
These are capitalists, these are capitalist countries!
They're capitalist countries, and if you want their help you have to moderate your slogans cos you're scaring them away!
I'm from Germany.
We wanted revolution and what happened?
We'd been the strongest movement in Europe... the best organised workers' movement.
There were six million of us in unions and what happened?
Hitler...
The socialists and the communists told us... to make our revolution later.
But I say make the revolution now.
When people see as the village sees that you can be in charge of your life, your land, when collectivisation becomes a reality, it'll be possible for people in Germany, Italy, to follow our example.
These people think they have, they think they have something, but they have nothing!
But we have to show to the people that, that we have... we're poor but we're alive and we've got power now, we don't have to be seized by fear.
We're alive, we'll die when our time comes, but...
All French working people are, are looking to us in Spain, probably all around the world and I think it is not the right time to fight, to fight each other but together.
Now all of us know the price of the freedom and we, we've lost a lot of friends.
Gene, your theories are very seductive but I've got one question for you.
Who are you trying to appease... foreign governments, foreign bankers?
What is a revolution?
It's nothing other than a radical change in privilege, wealth and power.
What's going to happen, what'...
the only way we'll appease, the only way we'll appease these people when the ideas are diluted and watered down till they mean absolutely nothing.
Now I think you're dead right when you say when you say that they must look beyond this village, and must look at what's happening outside.
Okay, but not only to foreign bankers and foreign governments.
What we must look to as well is that outside these windows, as we speak, on this land are two million landless peasants.
From the day they were born they had absolutely no hope other than a life of misery.
And unless we harness that energy now the ideas will be dead, there'll be no change and this will all be in vain.
Ideas are the basis of this.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, those people will be dead never mind the ideas!
If Franco comes in, you know, if Franco wins this war he'll just kill a million of those people.
They're nothing to him.
They're just a piece of shit!
That's obvious, I agree with that.
Exactly.
So, unless we win the war, there's no point in having the ideology.
The ideology does not exist in, in like, in a book.
It exists, has to exist in place.
It'd have to be real, for real people.
I say that we have to take risks.
What do we do?
Misery, hunger, hopelessness.
Franco might come back and kill us but I say it's worth it to continue collectivising and improving the quality of our lives.
Let's vote!
All those in favour of collectivisation.
All those against.
Friends, the vote is to collectivise the land.
You all right?
Want a hand?
Yeah.
I thought maybe your foot was hurtin'.
It's okay, thank you.
No problem.
Hola.
Hola.
And you talk about being poor.
Who?
You.
With Coogan that night.
We were just talking about when we were kids.
I tell you what poor is.
Two pesetas a day for agricultural labours if you're lucky.
Peasant families living in caves or sandpits that is poor.
That is why we need the revolution.
Don't laugh!
I'm not laughing.
I saw you!
I wasn't laughing!
D'you want a hand with that?
Oh, I can see you've got one.
Don't say any more!
What I'm saying, Kit, is that I'm not the man I was.
I feel like I'm standing on higher ground, if you see what I mean.
I can see further and, and I notice things I hadn't even thought of before.
Like I, I left Liverpool with a daft romantic idea but in war people get killed.
Fellas like Coogan... and the women and kids who died in this village that's all part of me now and I'll never shake it off.
Fascist planes dropped leaflets on us yesterday saying how they was winning the war.
Well, myself, it's hard to know what's going on in the rest of Spain.
But here, on the Aragon front, we're holding our own.
And if only we had decent arms.
Who knows?
Perhaps a line of Russian tanks will come rolling over the hill.
Some hope, eh?
Pigat, Garibaldi, Roca...
Listen...
Max...
Come here.
Companeros, listen please.
I have to go to the Command Post for a very important meeting with the General Staff of the Column.
And I say, very important because we are going to discuss about our integration in the new Popular Army.
There is no choice.
The government in Valencia says no more militia and say we all must become part in the new communist led Popular Army.
Okay?
So, if we refuse they continue to withhold arms.
To keep arms from us.
Do you understand?
Let's take a vote, no?
Votamos?
I have something to say, please.
Please.
Excuse me a moment, please.
This is probably the last time that we can vote on something as a militia.
All right?
Please.
Maybe we could integrate to the new Popular Army and get the weapons join together and be still in the militia too.
You're a dreamer, Pigat.
It's impossible.
Look, I think we have, we have to try to see the reality of the situation here.
Okay?
Who's ever gonna give us guns, the Russians or whomever they're not going to give them to us if they don't think that we know how to use them and that we're not properly trained.
So it makes sense that the best training is going to come from a regular disciplined army.
That's obvious.
I can't see what's wrong with that at all.
Everything is wrong.
The creation of the new army with its saluting and discipline and military hierarchy will destroy the revolutionary spirit of the people.
Okay?
And it's exactly what Stalinists expect.
What?
That makes no sense, Bernard.
Absolutely.
The Communist Party was set up for revolution.
Why would they want to suppress the revolutionary spirit?
It is no more revolutionary.
Look, the militia is the heart of the struggle.
Stalin fears us because he wants to sign treaties with the west and he already did, did it with France.
So, to sign treaties, to reach an agreement... he needs to be respectable and reassuring.
Okay?
So, if he supports us and the revolution we are making... he will lost his... respectability.
That's the reason why we are a real threat for Stalin and also for the other countries.
I don't know, Bernard, I... what you are saying might be right, I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay.
But I do know we're not going to win this war with a bunch of amateurs.
You may be an amateur, I'm not!
Jesus Christ!
We've done, we've done okay up, up to now, Gene.
We could have done better with guns.
We saved Valencia, Madrid, Barcelona... and we lost Toledo, Malaga and more... we've got to be clear about one thing here.
There's blackmail going on.
If we accept those arms, they come with conditions.
They're not interested in partners, they want stooges.
Let's vote...
Let them know what we think.
Do we support our General Stafe when they insist on keeping our own revolutionary organisations?
Si?
Everybody?
Si.
It's a clear majority.
Now watch.
Put the bullet in here.
Yes?
Understand?
That's it.
You take off the catch and it's ready for firing.
Si...
Come on then, "Mr Laurel".
Remarkable resemblance.
Remarkable.
Even down to the blank expression.
There you go.
You need to hold the rifle harder against your shoulder.
Fire.
Whey!
How's your shoulder?
You're afraid of the rifle.
Si.
Yes.
Hold it firmly like this.
You mustn't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze it like a woman's tits.
Understand?
Have you ever squeezed a woman's tits?
Yeah.
Yes?
I'll bet you have.
Hold on a minute.
Fuck!
Come quickly.
I know.
Are you okay?
Get a stick.
A stick!
Hey, hey, try to keep calm.
Is he all right?
Yeah, yeah!
I'm all right!
We must get him to the hospital.
What happened?
What happened?
Fucking rifle blew up in my face.
Jesus!
Piece of shit!
Jesus!
Are you satisfied now?
This is the shitty equipment you voted for!
Don't you have anything better to say?
Please give him some peace.
Don't you see?
Yeah, I can see.
I see a stupid idealist with a death wish.
Can't you see what's going on here?
It's over!
It's kaput!
It's finished.
Jesus, easy, easy man!
Oh fuck!
I've had it!
I cannot stay here watching people die of stupidity!
I can't do it!
I've had it!
I'm getting out of this!
Fuck it!
David, if you had any fucking brains you'd do the exact same thing!
Davey, let me see your eyes.
Are your eyes okay?
Yeah.
Oh, you daft bastard!
How's that?
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
Easy...
How far is this place?
About four miles.
They patch you up and send you to the hospital in Barcelona.
When you get out of the hospital... you'll need somewhere to rest for a while before you come back.
Yeah.
I know a place, a pension in Barcelona where the people from the POUM stay.
Would you like the address?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.
You stay there yourself, this pension?
Yeah, sometimes.
I know the old lady.
You stay there.
Tell her my name.
I will.
I'll say: "Blanca sent me.
Can you give me a nice room, please?".
Look after yourself, Blanca.
I'll see you soon.
Is this boarding house around here?
The Pension Adela?
Hello.
Do you have a room for me?
Who are you?
My friend Blanca sent me...
I like having English people, they are clean and tidy.
This is my room?
This is yours.
Si.
Hola.
Hello.
How are you?
Great.
What are you doing here?
You're not pleased to see me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just shocked.
How's your arm?
Oh, it's much better now.
I had the stitches taken out two days ago.
What are you doing here?
Bernard gave me seven days leave.
I thought I would surprise you.
You definitely have, without doubt.
I bought some wine.
It's on the table.
I'll be with you in a minute.
All right, yeah.
Help yourself.
Pour a glass for me.
Si, claro!
Please.
How's Bernard?
He's fine.
You know.
Women aren't allowed to fight any more.
New rules.
Yeah, I heard.
I can be a nurse.
I can drive a truck.
I can be a cook.
But I mustn't shoot a gun any more.
I must know my place as a woman.
Maite is going to be a cook.
No!
Yes.
She will... she will be the worst in the militia.
Well that's without doubt.
It doesn't sound at all like her.
Things are changing very quickly.
Yeah?
What did Vidal say about the whole thing?
No... please.
I don't want to talk about it.
All right.
Today I want to forget it all... bullets, trenches... politics, killings, betrayals.
I want to feel human for a change.
Salut.
Salut.
Take off your shirt.
What?
Come on.
Take off your shirt!
All right, all right.
All right.
It's got buttons, you know.
Take care.
What's going on?
The police from the old days.
And now they are back.
No guns for us at the front... and here in Barcelona the police have guns sticking out of their arse.
I'll make some coffee.
Do you have some matches?
What?
No matches.
Yeah, there's some matches in my bag.
What is this?
What?
This?
We get no uniforms like this in the militia.
Look...
I meant to tell you.
I'm not in the militia any more.
I've joined the International Brigade.
I leave for Albacete on Friday.
Stalinist!
Come on.
Come on.
You vote!
You vote to keep the militia!
Yeah, but... things are different now.
I've changed my mind.
It's because of Lawrence?
No!
He left the day after!
No, it's not because of that!
I'm a member of the Communist Party.
I've never hidden it.
But you fought with us!
With the POUM!
Yeah, I fought with the POUM.
And look at the fuck that happened to me.
I've got a big piece of metal in my arm.
But you know perfectly well why!
You know they refuse us arms!
David!
The Stalinists are betraying the revolution!
I don't believe that.
Go to La Batalla.
Talk to them there.
I haven't got to talk to La Batalla.
I've been in hospital, I was talking to others.
Our leaders have been expelled from the government.
That's politics.
That's the way politics works.
No!
They are trying to ban us.
Say we are, we are social fascists!
And you know, you know this!
You know our papers are banned, journalists arrested and here they even talk about torture chambers.
Camaras de tortura!
I don't know that, do I?
I'll wait till I see it with my own eyes.
But you don't see it!
You don't want to see it.
Why you didn't tell me yesterday?
I was going to tell you.
I meant to tell you, just...
Liar!
Come on, look.
I've tried but...
Blanca...
I came to Spain to fight for socialism, to fight for the Republic!
And the best way I can think to do that is with the International Brigades.
And if, if what you're saying is true then I'm sure there's a good reason.
There's an explanation of some sort.
Of course it's true!
And there is an explanation.
It's called Stalinism!
Look, what are you going to do now?
I go back to the front, where my real comrades are.
Oh look, come on!
Blanca!
For fucks sake, Blanca.
Listen!
Blanca!
Look after yourself, will ya?
Please.
(GERMAN EAGLES ON GUERNICA BOMBS)
So that's why I'm in Barcelona.
It's dead complicated, Kit, and difficult to explain.
The problem is the struggle seems to be falling apart in front of our eyes.
No-one trusts anyone any more.
Anarchists and POUM are pulling one way, communists in another.
It's mad.
All I can do is believe the Party.
They must know what they're doing.
JOINT PLANS TO BREAK MADRID FRONT
The city is like a powder keg waiting to go off.
Trucks of assault guards everywhere.
And now there's trouble at the telephone exchange which is run by the anarchists.
The police just took it by force.
They say the anarchists are sabotaging the war effort by interfering with government business.
There's fighting in the streets, barricades going up all over the place.
There's shootings.
Comrades against comrades.
Fascist must be laugh that, that's all.
David.
The attack of the telephone exchange is a declaration of war against the working class... what are the POUM up to?
A general strike has been called in all industries except those producing weapons...
Plants, machine shops, warehouses... are stopping work.
The barricades of liberty have risen again in every part of town!
Arm yourselves to defend the revolution!
You should be killing fascists not one another!
What are you saying?
We've got nothing to eat.
D'you hear?
We've got to put food on the table.
Please get out of the way.
Sorry, friend.
I'm sorry.
Bastards!
Hey, you, Stalin's sidekick.
What division were you in?
The Karl Marx Division.
And you?
The Third Division?
No, you bastard.
We're from the Durutti Division, the best.
You don't even know who's your enemy.
You idiots!
You idiots!
You have betrayed the revolution.
That's a lie.
You are the ones who have broken the anti-fascists front.
I've been at the front and I know.
Are you English?
Yeah.
You?
Where are you from?
Manchester.
Fucking hell, I'm from Liverpool.
What you doin' here?
Don't know.
Why aren't you over here with us?
Why aren't you over here with us?
I don't fucking know.
We can smell food, fascists.
What are you cooking, bastards?
Sausages and beans.
Are you hungry?
You bet!
Then here you are.
No more.
Never.
We're not enemies.
My friend, Martin, returned from the front dying of hunger.
It's a disaster.
Which front?
Aragon.
When it's decision time, everyone is the boss.
They say they don't even know how to load the guns.
Get away!
They say the militia women aren't killing fascists, they are fucking them instead!
They fuck them.
They do nothing.
They're crap.
They're a disaster, they take 4 totally inexperienced men.
That's a lie.
I'm from the front.
I'm in the militia.
You're in the militia?
You're in the militia?
He can't even speak properly.
What?
What are you saying?
Listen, you're a fucking kid.
You know fuck all.
Do you understand me?
Yes, a kid.
You don't know nothing.
You've seen fuck all.
What's going on?
Son of a bitch!
Quiet!
You fucking know-nothing, you little snotty-nosed little kid!
What's going on?
That's enough.
Are you mad, or what?
What do you think is going on?
If the leaders of the POUM and CNT get together, we're fucked.
That's what's happening!
They need to come from abroad to tell us that?
At least it's good that they're here.
Lazarus.
Yeah.
Back from the dead.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Gone but not forgotten, eh?
Has vuelto?
Si.
Roca!
Andres!
Que tal amigo?
Yeah.
Are you a spy of the communists?
Si.
Fucking English.
You're welcome.
Good to see you.
We have a new cook now.
Maite!
Maite!
Fucking shit, the woman's doing the cooking...
Hola, amigo!
David!
David!
Si!
What are you doing here?
I came back for something to eat.
Oh great!
I heard you'd taken over the cooking.
No, seriously, what happened?
No, seriously, what's on the menu?
Seriously...
Fucking beans!
Go to hell, Pigat.
It's terrible!
Hola.
Fine.
And you?
So so.
What are you doing here?
I'm glad to see you again.
Si, si.
Yo tambien.
The party stinks, Kit.
And I never thought the day'd come when I'd have to say that.
It's evil and corrupt.
In Barcelona I saw good comrades snatched off the streets and executed others disappeared into torture chambers, and it's still going on.
Stalin is just using the working class like pieces on a chessboard to be bartered, used and sacrificed.
Things have changed while I've been away.
Some of the old faces are missing because they couldn't stomach all the in-fighting and all-in-all we've taken a bit of a battering.
It's rumoured we're going to make a big attack soon and still no weapons, no support.
But this one we're going to win.
Despite everything, our spirits are high.
Keep cover!
Viva!
Medico!
Medico!
We have had many casualties.
They're bombing us...
Liste... where's the cover you promised?
What kind of position is this?
Nobody's come.
You don't understand anything.
Nobody's come.
We can't hold on.
Those fucking Stalinist bastards.
This should have been over hours ago, mate.
They should have fucking taken that hill hours ago.
Trust them just to make a fucking point.
They've dumped us, Davey!
Madruga.
Si...
Ammunition!
Wait...
I'm waiting!
I'm not going anywhere, am I?
See we're hemmed in here, mate.
They know where we are.
Where are they?
Where's the asaltos?
Never mind in fucking reserve!
We're fucked here... we can't hold this position any longer.
We must stay here.
No.
We can't.
We don't have any weapons.
We don't have... we must show them what we are, Bernard.
Listen, they know exactly what's happening here.
Nobody's sending arms or the army.
We will die alone, here, and you will do their game.
We are fighters.
Bernard, we are fighters!
It's an order.
We're fucked here...
This is madness.
You've got to hold on.
Yes, sir.
Retreat immediately.
Why are you giving me this order when you've just told me to hold the position?
All right?
I also want to know...
listen... why we've been risking our lives here waiting for the promised reinforcements.
All right?
Whatever you say, sir.
Madruga, Andres, come here and the rest, quickly.
Garibaldi, Roca, we're going back to our old positions.
Come on, Roca.
Bernard, to the left with Jimmy.
David, cover this flank.
Come on!
Quickly, orderly, orderly...
go with them...
Come on, David.
All of you get back.
Come on... back...
Come on...
My fucking leg!
Blanca, come here.
Orderly.
Orderly, there's a bad one, quick!
Stay with them.
Come on, Jimmy!
Be brave.
Oh, my leg!
Mira, mira, the cavalry have come.
If they've come to fight, they're a bit late for that one, aren't they?
Hey, Gene.
Gene!
Gene... what are you doing here?
Gene, what are you doing here?
Take it easy.
Bernard, keep everybody calm.
Stay where you are!
Quiet, everybody.
What the hell's going on?
Listen.
Drop your weapons on the ground, immediately.
Obey the order!
What's going on, Lawrence?
Listen.
Es una orden.
What's the meaning of this?
Can we know why?
Officer, get your men to obey.
I refuse.
Obey my orders!
From now on this unit is disbanded.
You can all go home, except for the following who are under arrest.
Quiet!
Juan Vidal
Bernard Goujon
Miguel Angel Campos
Rafael Jimenez
Ni locos... what are we accused of?
The POUM is now illegal.
Your newspaper has been banned and your leaders arrested.
What charges?
Conspiring with the fascists... collaborating with Franco!
Is this conspiracy?
Is this conspiracy, Colonel?
Jesus!
It's a lie... it's a lie... while we've been getting fucking shot...
Don't look at the ground look at me face to face.
It's not a reflection on you it's your leaders.
It's a Stalinist plot.
The fucking government's a load of bollocks!
Sietamo, what about Sietamo?
Alcubierre?
Come on, Gene, what about the people...
Lecinena?
Casetas de Quisena?
Tierz?
Navales?
They're all places liberated by the POUM.
Were they fascists who did that?
What about fucking Coogan and the others, who died?
Are we all fascists all of a sudden?
Were these places liberated by fascists, too?
It was the men of the POUM who defended Madrid.
Were these places liberated by Franco?
Quiet!
Obey my orders!
Prepare to fire!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
Quiet!
What shall we do with the wounded?
Madruga, quiet!
You're under arrest.
Do as he says.
What happened in Barcelona with our comrades?
Murderers!
They're going to shoot you...
Murderers!
Control your men, Captain.
Control your men, Captain.
Fight with us against fascism.
Fascist bastard, come here and say that face to face with us.
Come here.
Coward, coward, come here.
Blanca!
They have to do this.
Come here.
Coward, come here!
They have to do this.
You're being tricked.
You're being tricked by your own leaders!
You're being lied to!
Fight with us.
They're tricking you.
You are tricking us!
No, the leaders of the POUM are tricking you!
You are tricking us!
Lawrence, open your eyes!
Come here, coward.
They have proof.
Come here!
Come here!
Blanca...!
Silence...
You idiots.
God Almighty!
Silence...
Murderers...
Vidal... what the fuck did you do that for?
We've fought for nothing, comrades.
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
You bastards...
Murderers...
Murderers... we've fought for nothing, comrades.
Lower your guns.
Death to Stalinism!
Long live the revolution...
Open your eyes!
Long live the revolution.
Down with fascism.
Thank you very much.
We buried Blanca in collectivised land.
She would have liked that... even though the Stalinists came four weeks later and broke up the commune.
At least the earth belonged to her for a short while.
I'm trying to get home, Kit, but it won't be easy.
They have a "wanted" list ad, as a so-called deserter and supporter of the POUM, my name's on it.
There are no "safe" houses and we spend our time hiding out in building sites and living rough.
Some of the most sincere and dedicated fighters against fascism have been murdered.
But if you get this letter... understand that I regret nothing.
Revolutions are contagious, and had we succeeded here... and we could have done.
We would have changed the world.
But never mind... our day will come.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many, but we are more... we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
Can I just say something a minute?
The other day, I found this.
It was amongst, like, my grandad's papers.
And I just thought it was, like, fitting for him.
It's a poem by William Morris, and I'd just like to read it out.
"Join in the battle"
"wherein no man can fail"
"For whoso fadeth and dieth"
"Yet his deeds shall all still prevail"
Wouldn't be on the first floor, would it?
Ambulance!
Yeah.
Yeah, here you are, love.
In 'ere.
It's the old fella.
He's collapsed on the couch.
Let's have a look at him, eh?
This is his grand-daughter.
You were here when this happened, were you?
Yeah, I just come in and found him on the couch.
What's his name?
- Dave Carr.
- Dave!
Dave!
Is he gonna be all right?
Dave?
Dave?
No response there, Dave.
No response, yeah...
How's he doing, love?
He's okay at the moment so let's just keep our fingers crossed.
Does he have any other close relatives at all?
There's my mum.
She lives in Wales, so, I mean, she doesn't see him often.
Her and me dad have split up.
Paul, make the hospital.
He's just gone on us, mate.
Oh, God!
Have we lost him?
Oh, God, Dot!
It's all right...

In February a coalition of socialist, republican and other left wing parties were victorious in the general election.
They proposed a series of democratic reforms.
The big landowners, industrialists, churchmen and army officers feared the growing power of the working class.

There was a military uprising led by the Fascist General Franco against the democratically elected government.
Government supporters formed militias to defend themselves.
Organised by trades unions and political parties, they went to fight for their democratic rights against the Fascists.
This, this is... this is the... one of the militias going to the Zaragosa front in, in Aragon.
You can see all the cars.
They've got the name of the workers' organisation... because they've all been nationalised, they've all been taken over by the workers.
That is the Union of, of the Railway workers.
This is the CNT... the anarchists' union.
As you can see... the support the whole of Barcelona is on the streets but with very few guns.
Most people haven't got guns.
You can see young, old, men, women.
These are the fascists.
The General, the defenders of privilege.
And this is what they are doing to us.
They are killed and left there... just for being trade unionists.
Every defeat for us is a defeat for you.
Every step that takes Franco closer to power in Spain also takes the fascists closer to power here.
If Franco wins the war... it would be a major boost for fascists everywhere.
And before long, comrades... they will drag all freedom-loving people down to barbarism and, and war.
Comrades, whether Spanish or English, or American or Chinese, we are one class of people with the same aspiration... the same hope for a just and equal society.
I want you to join with us... make our fight your fight.
Let's come together... let's come together...
Let's take up the slogan.
No Pasaran.
They shall not pass.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
You've got our support.
We're right behind you.
We wanna fight.
No Pasaran.
Kit...
I'm going to go to Spain.
What, just like that you're going to Spain?
Well, not just like that but...
It'll take a while to organise.
I'll go to Barcelona, sort it out from there.
Why you?
Why have you got to go?
Because I can.
I haven't got any kids or nothing.
I mean, you know...
What am I doing here, Kit?
I'm on fifteen bob a week on the dole.
Y'know, there's millions of us, out of work.
I'm on, you know, demonstrations, hunger marches just...
I know.
I've been there with you.
I know.
But I want to do something.
And you can't do it here?
If we've got to do it, we've got to do it now.
We've got to stop them.
Otherwise it's not, it's going to be too late, Kit.
We'll have no future here.
I can't spare you.
Come here.
Dear Kit...
Well, I made it.
It was a bit tricky and the sea was rough.
I was glad to get off that ship.
But Larry, who smuggled me aboard, turned up trumps.
He got us ashore, in one piece, at Marseilles... and put us on the road to Spain.
And then I hitched a lift in a couple of lorries to the border.
It seems there's no organisation here to help volunteers like me - you've just got to make your own way.
With no passport, crossing the frontier wasn't easy and I had to walk across the Pyrenees.
I must have climbed for miles.
My boots are all shot to pieces and my feet are steaming.
I was scared stiff but we made it.
Would you like to sit down?
Would you like to sit down?
Madam, could you please move the chickens?
Now I'm in Spain and everything is so bright it hurts your eyes.
I've 'copped' the train for Barcelona.
Maybe I'll see some action.
He said that they could use your feet as a weapon against Franco.
What do you do here?
Oh, I've come to fight for the Republic.
Good.
The more that come, the sooner we'll win.
Do you want a drop?
- Thanks.
- Salud!
Gracias.
Smoke?
Smoke?
Oh, with pleasure.
My name is Bernard.
Bernard Goujon.
Pleased to meet you.
David Carr.
Bernard.
D'you smoke, lads?
Do you have papers, documentation?
Yeah, I've got my Party card.
My Com, Communist Party of Great Britain membership.
Yeah, I've got it here.
Look, it's like that.
See?
It's for a comrade of the POUM.
The what?
The POUM, P-O-U-M.
- Never heard of that?
- No, never heard of the POUM.
It's Spanish workers' Party.
Revolutionaries.
Tickets, please.
He's with us, boss.
He's come to fight the fascists.
Welcome in Spain.
Thanks very much.
The Trade Union is controlling all the line.
Thanks.
Thanks.
So it's a present for you.
Oh, don't have to pay?
No, no, don't have to pay.
Thanks very much.
Thanks, comrade.
Gracias.
Left, right, left, right...
Alto!
Halt!
Turn to right.
Alto!
Turn to right.
Alto!
Hey, dickhead.
Make up your mind.
Shut up.
I'm in charge here.
I'm pissed off with this.
This is important.
Pick it up immediately.
You pick it up.
I'm off.
Where are you going, love?
Don't call me "love".
Comrade, comrade...
I am going to Madrid.
Understand?
They take things seriously there.
This is vital for the revolution for both men and women.
We've got to have discipline.
We'll never win without it.
Where are we going going to get to with this...
This is just the beginning.
I want a gun.
You'll get to fight...
Please trust me...
Get back in the line...
What are you lot gawking at?
Let's have some energy.
I've seen more life in a sick note.
Right!
Halt!
In Germany I was a pastry cook.
Pastry...
Yeah, pastry cook.
And you, Gene, what was your job?
Eleven years on the sea.
Bosun.
Bosun?
Yes.
I've just spent six days on the sea and it was not for me.
I was, went from Liverpool to Marseilles and I was sick all the time.
So...
I'm not a sailor.
I was a servant.
A cleaner.
Servant.
For an English family.
On the first day everything starts they went running to England so they left, they left me alone in Barcelona.
I'm free for the first time of my life.
Salud, camaradas.
Thank you, thank you.
You got the weapons?
Yes.
Antiques.
Antiques?
German, Mauser, 1896.
Single load.
How many?
Thirty.
Okay.
All right.
Be better using a big stick.
Okay.
Get these off and take them over there into the 'store place'.
When did you learn about guns?
Five years in French Army, I was sergeant.
Comrade.
Where you from?
Italiano.
Milano.
Italiano?
So you know fascism?
They're bastards.
Que?
Do you need some help?
No, I'll do it myself.
Vale, leona.
Aye, aye, soft ollies.
Are you taking the piss?
Want to change?
Come here!
Sit down.
Sit down, please.
Garibaldi, come here.
My name's Rafael Poccetti, Captain.
I know.
But I need Garibaldis more than I need Poccettis.
Sit down, please.
Leona, tu tambien.
Okay.
In the other side of the hill are the trenches.
Our trenches.
And beyond them is the enemy.
And the only good soldier in Franco's Army is a dead one.
My name is Vidal and I'm your Captain.
We are the POUM and we organise this section of the, of the front.
To the west of us are the anarchists.
And we fight together, comrades in arms to defeat, to destroy the fascists and make the workers' and peasants' revolution.
Understand?
Don't forget it.
You are welcome here because you are my speaking squad English.
Okay?
We are proud to have you fight with us in our side.
Hey, David...
look.
The whores are also at the front.
Yeah, but they're better looking than the ones back home.
Yeah?
Good morning, Coogan.
Your reinforcements are here now.
I thought it was Sunday.
Dear Kit.
Well, I'm a soldier now with the POUM Militia.
It's a People's Army.
Just ordinary men and women fighting for a cause, not like the Army back home.
There's no saluting'.
We elect the officers, and everything's discussed and voted on.
It's socialism in action.
I'm in a special section.
It's mainly internationals but some Spanish... and the common language is English, so we get by.
An Irishman called Coogan is in charge.
We're all on the same pay - ten pesetas a day - which is kept for us for when we go on leave.
And we also get a packet of fags a day, which isn't bad.
It's a huge operation, about twenty thousand militia on this front alone.
I'm not in the communist brigade, but it doesn't matter cos we're all fightin' the same enemy.
Viva Franco!
Viva Espana!
Fascists bastards.
Rot in hell!
Sons of bitches!
Fascists, you've got no balls.
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse.
Hey, rich bastard, you'll die with nothing.
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse!
You must be used to this weather coming from your godforsaken town.
It never stops fuckin' raining!
You been, have you?
Yeah, five years, Manchester.
Staring at the poxy rain through prison bars.
What d'you get put down for?
Fightin' the Brits.
Murderer...
Murderer of a free nation.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
There's all sorts here:
French, German, Yanks, Spanish of course, and a Scot by the name of Jimmy.
All good lads.
The front line doesn't seem to move.
We watch the fascists, and they watch us.
Lots of hanging about waiting' for something to happen.
Digging trenches, going out on patrol, sentry duty.
But worst of all is the lice.
They're worse than the nits back home.
They send you mad.
They lay their eggs in the lining of your trousers and you can't get rid of 'em.
You're forever scratching.
The food's not great.
It's usually bread and beans which gives us all a problem...
I could murder some cabbage and ribs.
The local women do the cooking.
It's strange to see women in the trenches fighting alongside the men.
But no need to worry, Kit, none of them could hold a candle to you.
Max...
You know what we said the other day when we came down... about Blanca being a whore.
You know, a prostitute.
Who?
Who?
Who?
You said that Blanca was a prostitute - a whore!
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Good one.
Good one?
Good one!
Yeah!
You are winding me up.
Everybody knows... except you.
Maite...?
True.
You know, David, Blanca has told me some stories... crazy ones.
Hard life...
Hard life... hard one!
In fact, Jose can tell you, you know.
He knows her very well, you know, because...
She knows how to do it... she's good and cheap.
Good and cheap, yeah.
Leave him alone.
David, it's the right moment.
Listen, she likes you, I tell you.
Good luck!
All right?
Yeah.
Do you want a cigarette?
No, thanks.
So, I mean, I was just thinking, if you're not busy later on, you might want to... you know, go for a walk with me.
You know...
I don't understand you.
Maybe me and you, you know, like... with, with Coogan.
When we saw you the other day...
Coogan is my man.
D'you understand?
Yeah.
Si.
Before the war we live together.
We join in the militia together.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I got...
- We fight together.
Sorry about that.
Sorry.
Yeah.
I'll see you later then.
You shower of bastards!
You...
I'll have a fuckin' word with you in a minute!
Have a nice time?
Have a nice time?
Yes, I did, thank you very much.
Marcel!
- David?
- Look.
Uh?
Fascist prisoners.
- No!
- An officer as well.
How many?
Besides the officer, there's...
Lawrence, Coogan, Jimmy.
I wonder where they found them?
I dunno.
This fucking señora wants a word with you.
Him and his sons, we found them behind the lines.
Doing a recce or something.
Anyway, they were lost.
At ease.
What's your name, lad?
José.
José?
Are you hungry?
Take them and get them something to eat, Jim.
And where are you going?
I've some questions for you.
I don't have to answer.
I'm a professional soldier.
Support the government elected by the people.
It's not a real government.
Muy bien...
How many soldiers in your command?
Have you got machine-guns?
Artillery?
Do your soldiers obey you?
Of course... we're a real army.

Mail.
- No.
- No?
No.
Sorry.
Coogan, over here.
Oh, great.
Pigat...
Are you all right?
- Pigat!
- Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Leave me alone.
I want to go home.
What's wrong?
I'm going home, okay?
Why?
I've got things to sort out.
You're crazy...
You can't just leave like this.
I came here willingly and I'll leave when I feel like it, okay?
No, it's not that easy.
You can't just go when you want to.
There's a discipline here.
My woman's fucking another man.
Who'll sort it out?
You?
Vidal?
Okay.
What are you going to do?
String the son of a bitch up by his balls.
And what good would that do?
Tell me, what good would that do?
Make me feel better.
Stay here... with your compañeros.
I came here for her, for my daughter, the future.
You've got a daughter?
She was two last month.
What's her name?
Lidia.
Look...
If we don't win this war there'll be no future for anybody.
Right?
Not for Lidia, not for your wife, not you, not me, not anyone.
Do you understand?
The photos'll give you some idea of how cold it was.
But what they don't show is how the rain turned everything into freezing mud.
We seemed to spend all our time searching for firewood, anything that'd burn and keep us warm.
This Coogan fella's a bit of a wild one.
Ex-IRA.
He's always first on patrol and last one back.
He knows what he's doing, but he does take chances.
His girlfriend's called Blanca.
She's in our section.
She's a bit of a character an' all.
Sharp as a razor.
They're not always hanging on to one another, but everyone knows they're a couple.
The worst thing about being here is doing nothing.
It seems we're just sittin' around and talkin' and arguing' politics all the time.
I come all this way to fight fascists and I can't get to grips with them.
Still... at last things are warming up a bit, not just the weather either.
Tomorrow's a big day.
We're attacking a village held by the fascists.
Think of us.
Lots of love, David.
Take off your sacks!
Vamos alla, valientes!
David, come on!
What's going on?
No!
No!
Chuck us a cartridge.
Hey, chuck us a fucking cartridge!
There's women down there!
Danny, you can't be serious.
Give us a fucking cartridge!
Danny, you can't put their lives in danger.
Coogan!
Coogan!
Fuego!
Don't shoot!
Speak to me!
Speak to me.
Speak to me!
This is the pig that was shooting from the tower.
Quiet!
Su rifle aun esta caliente.
I'm going to ask one simple question.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
Tell me the truth.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
There's the proof.
What's this then?
Kill him!
He informed on five comrades from the Union, and they're dead now.
Yeah, kill him.
What happened?
They took my husband and shaved my head.
Why?
Why?
Because my husband was in the militia.
Y no lo pudieren coger.
Eran anarquistas.
They were young anarchists.
Somebody say to the priest in confession where they were.
He told this to the fascists.
He knew the fascists kill them.
Murderer!
We've got to kill him.
Delato a nuestros compañeros!
And we'll see you in three days...
Two or three days.
I'll stay here with twenty men for three days.
Very nice indeed.
Very nice.
I'm happy you appreciate French good taste.
Hola, chico!
Gracias, amiga.
Blanca...
I just want you to know how sorry I am for what happened.
I should have opened fire but I didn't and, and they got him.
That's all there is to it.
The thing is, he was a good man.
You know, he was a brave man.
We're all going to miss him.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I...
Oh, come on... come on...
When I met him the first time... he was playing... how do you say...
- The guitar?
- No.
Yeah, the smaller one.
- Banjo?
- Yeah.
He was playing banjo.
In bars and cafés.
I'm sorry, Blanca, you know, it's my fault.
And I...
No.
No, I'm...
I'm responsible because...
No.
You didn't kill him.
Fascists did.
He said he just wanted, like, bullets and I said that, like, I wouldn't...
It could have happened sooner or later to any of us.
We feel a great sorrow today, but it must not halt our efforts.
Our companions have not died in vain.
Josefina, Sebastian, Teresa, all of you - we all fight for the same things as they did.
And we shall continue.
It's what they would have wanted.
They're here with us, fighting for the same cause.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many.
But we are more, we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
The struggle goes on.
They shall no pass.
We shall overcome.
Viva la revolución!
Viva!
Muerte al fascismo!
Muerte!
Come on, sit down...
Friends...
Don Julian's house is now the house of the people.
Let's start the meeting.
Who's going to speak?
- Teresa.
- We must collectivise.
The men at the front have no food and the people in the village have been left with next to nothing by the fascists.
The village hasn't got enough food.
We must collectivise as soon as possible.
We must get food to feed our people and the comrades fighting for us at the front.
I'm in agreement with the collectivisation of Don Julian's lands or re-distribution in all its forms, but each to his own little bit...
no?
Wait...
José, speak.
I work my land my own way - it's not much, all that I have -
I started working it and... shit...
I've thrown everything into it.
Miguel.
What would you like to say?
I'd like to say to our friend here that it's very good that he wants to work his own land, but how much better it would be if we all worked it together.
When the harvest is ready, are you going to eat all the wheat and all the potatoes?
You are not to say so...
We need everything to be able... to keep the revolution going.
The revolution has to be done this way.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
Jose, it's not only a question of land.
Hay que hacer una sociedad nueva!
Un momento, Miguel, que Aniceto habia...
Yo habia pedido la palabra, y a nosotros nos dejais de lado.
The revolution is like a pregnant cow, if we don't help out... the cow and its calf will be gone and the children will be left hungry.
Remember that comrades, boys, died in this battle.
We must collectivise.
Do you understand me?
The people must eat.
This struggle we've started has to continue.
There are those who are the way they are and there are those who know how to work and people who don't...
I've got what I've got because I work.
Hold on.
Paco's turn.
It's fundamental that we improve our harvests...
We must grow more.
Other villages have done it by working all the land as one.
With a tractor you can do five times more work in one day than you can with a mule.
Un momento.
No hablemos todos juntos.
Un momento.
Sebastian.
There's evidence from other villages that it's working.
I believe we have to take over private property.
No one's got anything.
We could pool all our resources and depending on each person's situation we could share it out.
If you need a cow, you'll get one.
We've all got four or five kids... and we've all bust a gut working, just like you.
Hey!
Momento!
Momento, compañeros...
We've got militia comrades here who may know what's happening elsewhere...
They've helped us here.
Teresa...
Pepe's right.
Our friends from the militia will have seen what's happened in other villages.
This is an open meeting - you can speak, too.
Your opinions are as welcome as any of ours.
Please speak.
It's your village.
You have to decide.
It's your decision.
Okay, this is what I think, and if anybody disagrees they should just say so right out.
Si.
Okay.
You should take this estate, this house, this land and divide it up amongst the people in the town right away.
Okay.
The decree passed by the Republican Government in October allows for that.
Okay.
It says all property owned by individuals involved in the insurrection will be confiscated.
Si, si.
The problem's different here... all the landowners help Franco.
We must collectivize all the lands.
You understand?
Todas las tierras, hay que colectivizar no solo dividir.
I understand that.
I understand that.
I'm not, I'm not a friend of the landowner.
Okay?
I'm not here to defend landowners.
Okay?
But what are you going to do when you have a guy like, what's his name, Pepe?
What are you going to do when you have a guy like Pepe who has...
He's a tenant farmer and he has a couple of acres of land... or a tradesman who doesn't want to be part of your collective?
Okay?
These people are anti-fascists.
What do you do then?
It sounds really great on paper, but in reality it won't work... because it's going to pit the peasants against the anti-fascists.
Okay?
You're fighting now and it's going to endanger your food production.
Lawrence, I think that private ownership of land must be totally given up, forgotten, cancelled... because it maintains people in a capitalist mentality.
I agree.
Okay.
I agree with, I mean,
I'm not here to argue for, for private property.
I know the definition of private property.
I know what it does.
Okay, I'm not arguing that.
This is not the time for these textbook arguments on socialism or land reform.
We have to defeat fascism, that's the priority.
Are you suspecting this man to, to speak about the textbook of... socialism?
No, I'm not!
Well, I'm, I'm agreeing with him.
Okay?
I'm agreeing with the collectivisation, all right?
But these people cannot collectivise anything if they're dead.
Okay?
Well, this is, is your opinion.
My opinion!
They asked for my opinion.
No, but in my village, the people didn't wait for the government to give them the land.
They took it themselves.
Nadie espero a que les dijesen que tenian que hacer con la tierra, la cogieron ellos mismos.
I want you to think beyond this village, okay, at a much bigger picture.
Okay.
I have no doubt that the Spanish people, on their own, could have 'licked' Franco.
But you're not fighting just Franco, you now have Mussolini and Hitler on your back.
Okay.
With the exception of Russia and Mexico... the rest of the world has turned its back on you.
Okay?
They refuse to sell the Republic arms.
Okay.
These are capitalists, these are capitalist countries!
They're capitalist countries, and if you want their help you have to moderate your slogans cos you're scaring them away!
I'm from Germany.
We wanted revolution, and what happened?
We'd been the strongest movement in Europe, the best organised workers' movement.
There were six million of us in unions, and what happened?
Hitler...
The socialists and the communists told us... to make our revolution later.
But I say make the revolution now.
When people see as the village sees that you can be in charge of your life, your land, when collectivisation becomes a reality, it'll be possible for people in Germany, Italy, to follow our example.
These people, they think they have something, but they have nothing!
But we have to show to the people that, that we have...
We're poor but we're alive and we've got power now, we don't have to be seized by fear.
We're alive, we'll die when our time comes, but...
All French working people are, are looking to us in Spain, probably all around the world and I think it is not the right time to fight, to fight each other but together.
Now all of us know the price of the freedom and we, we've lost a lot of friends.
Gene, your theories are very seductive but I've got one question for you.
Who are you trying to appease... foreign governments, foreign bankers?
What is a revolution?
It's nothing other than a radical change in privilege, wealth and power.
What's going to happen, what...
The only way we'll appease, the only way we'll appease these people when the ideas are diluted and watered down till they mean absolutely nothing.
Now I think you're dead right when you say when you say that they must look beyond this village, and must look at what's happening outside.
Okay, but not only to foreign bankers and foreign governments.
What we must look to as well is that outside these windows, as we speak, on this land are two million landless peasants.
From the day they were born they had absolutely no hope other than a life of misery.
And unless we harness that energy now the ideas will be dead, there'll be no change and this will all be in vain.
Ideas are the basis of this.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, those people will be dead.
Never mind the ideas!
If Franco comes in, you know, if Franco wins this war he'll just kill a million of those people.
They're nothing to him.
They're just a piece of shit!
That's obvious, I agree with that.
Exactly.
So, unless we win the war, there's no point in having the ideology.
The ideology does not exist in, in like, in a book.
It exists, has to exist in place.
It'd have to be real, for real people.
I say that we have to take risks.
What do we do?
Misery, hunger, hopelessness.
Franco might come back and kill us but I say it's worth it to continue collectivising and improving the quality of our lives.
Let's vote!
All those in favour of collectivisation.
All those against.
Friends, the vote is to collectivise the land.
You all right?
Want a hand?
Yeah.
I thought maybe your foot was hurtin'.
It's okay, thank you.
No problem.
Hola.
Hola.
And you talk about being poor.
Who?
You.
With Coogan that night.
We were just talking about when we were kids.
I tell you what poor is.
Two pesetas a day for agricultural labours, if you're lucky.
Peasant families living in caves or sandpits.
That is poor.
That is why we need the revolution.
- Don't laugh!
- I'm not laughing.
- I saw you!
- I wasn't laughing!
D'you want a hand with that?
Oh, I can see you've got one.
Don't say any more!
What I'm saying, Kit, is that I'm not the man I was.
I feel like I'm standing on higher ground, if you see what I mean.
I can see further and, and I notice things I hadn't even thought of before.
Like I, I left Liverpool with a daft romantic idea but in war people get killed.
Fellas like Coogan... and the women and kids who died in this village, that's all part of me now and I'll never shake it off.
Fascist planes dropped leaflets on us yesterday saying how they was winning the war.
Well, myself, it's hard to know what's going on in the rest of Spain.
But here, on the Aragon front, we're holding our own.
And if only we had decent arms.
Who knows?
Perhaps a line of Russian tanks will come rolling over the hill.
Some hope, eh?
Pigat, Garibaldi, Roca...
Listen...
Max...
Come here.
Compañeros, listen please.
I have to go to the Command Post for a very important meeting with the General Staff of the Column.
And I say, very important because we are going to discuss about our integration in the new Popular Army.
There is no choice.
The government in Valencia says no more militia and say we all must become part in the new communist led Popular Army.
Okay?
So, if we refuse they continue to withhold arms.
To keep arms from us.
Do you understand?
Let's take a vote, no?
Votamos?
I have something to say, please.
Please.
Excuse me a moment, please.
This is probably the last time that we can vote on something as a militia.
All right?
Please.
Maybe we could integrate to the new Popular Army and get the weapons, join together and be still in the militia too.
You're a dreamer, Pigat.
It's impossible.
Look, I think we have, we have to try to see the reality of the situation here.
Okay?
Who's ever gonna give us guns, the Russians or whomever, they're not going to give them to us if they don't think that we know how to use them and that we're not properly trained.
So it makes sense that the best training is going to come from a regular disciplined army.
That's obvious.
I can't see what's wrong with that at all.
Everything is wrong.
The creation of the new army with its saluting and discipline and military hierarchy will destroy the revolutionary spirit of the people.
Okay?
And it's exactly what Stalinists expect.
What?
That makes no sense, Bernard.
Absolutely.
The Communist Party was set up for revolution.
Why would they want to suppress the revolutionary spirit?
It is no more revolutionary.
Look, the militia is the heart of the struggle.
Stalin fears us because he wants to sign treaties with the west and he already did, did it with France.
So, to sign treaties, to reach an agreement... he needs to be respectable and reassuring.
Okay?
So, if he supports us and the revolution we are making... he will lost his... respectability.
That's the reason why we are a real threat for Stalin and also for the other countries.
I don't know, Bernard, I...
What you are saying might be right, I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay?
But I do know we're not going to win this war with a bunch of amateurs.
You may be an amateur, I'm not!
Jesus Christ!
We've done, we've done okay up, up to now, Gene.
We could have done better with guns.
We saved Valencia, Madrid, Barcelona...
And we lost Toledo, Malaga and more...
We've got to be clear about one thing here.
There's blackmail going on.
If we accept those arms, they come with conditions.
They're not interested in partners, they want stooges.
Let's vote...
Let them know what we think.
Do we support our General Staff when they insist on keeping our own revolutionary organisations?
Si?
Everybody?
Si.
It's a clear majority.
Now watch.
Put the bullet in here.
Yes?
Understand?
That's it.
You take off the catch and it's ready for firing.
Si...
Come on then, "Mr Laurel".
Remarkable resemblance.
Remarkable.
Even down to the blank expression.
There you go.
You need to hold the rifle harder against your shoulder.
Fire.
Whey!
How's your shoulder?
You're afraid of the rifle.
- Si.
- Yes.
Hold it firmly like this.
You mustn't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze it like a woman's tits.
Understand?
Have you ever squeezed a woman's tits?
- Yeah.
- Yes?
I'll bet you have.
Hold on a minute.
Fuck!
Come quickly.
I know.
Are you okay?
Get a stick.
A stick!
Hey, hey, try to keep calm.
Is he all right?
Yeah, yeah!
I'm all right!
We must get him to the hospital.
What happened?
What happened?
Fucking rifle blew up in my face.
Jesus!
Piece of shit!
Jesus!
Are you satisfied now?
This is the shitty equipment you voted for!
Don't you have anything better to say?
Please give him some peace.
Don't you see?
Yeah, I can see.
I see a stupid idealist with a death wish.
Can't you see what's going on here?
It's over!
It's kaput!
It's finished.
Jesus, easy, easy man!
Oh, fuck!
I've had it!
I cannot stay here watching people die of stupidity!
I can't do it!
I've had it!
I'm getting out of this!
Fuck it!
David, if you had any fucking brains you'd do the exact same thing!
Davey, let me see your eyes.
Are your eyes okay?
Yeah.
Oh, you daft bastard!
- How's that?
- I'm all right.
- Open your eyes.
- I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
Easy...
How far is this place?
About four miles.
They patch you up and send you to the hospital in Barcelona.
When you get out of the hospital... you'll need somewhere to rest for a while before you come back.
Yeah.
I know a place, a pension in Barcelona where the people from the POUM stay.
Would you like the address?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.
You stay there yourself, this pension?
Yeah, sometimes.
I know the old lady.
You stay there.
Tell her my name.
I will.
I'll say: "Blanca sent me.
Can you give me a nice room, please?"
Look after yourself, Blanca.
I'll see you soon.
Is this boarding house around here?
The Pension Adela?
Hello.
Do you have a room for me?
Who are you?
My friend Blanca sent me...
I like having English people, they are clean and tidy.
This is my room?
This is yours.
Si.
- Hola.
- Hello.
How are you?
Great.
What are you doing here?
You're not pleased to see me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just shocked.
How's your arm?
Oh, it's much better now.
I had the stitches taken out two days ago.
What are you doing here?
Bernard gave me seven days leave.
I thought I would surprise you.
You definitely have, without doubt.
I bought some wine.
It's on the table.
I'll be with you in a minute.
All right, yeah.
Help yourself.
Pour a glass for me.
Si, claro!
Please.
How's Bernard?
He's fine.
You know, women aren't allowed to fight any more.
New rules.
Yeah, I heard.
I can be a nurse.
I can drive a truck.
I can be a cook.
But I mustn't shoot a gun any more.
I must know my place as a woman.
Maite is going to be a cook.
No!
Yes.
She will... she will be the worst in the militia.
Well, that's without doubt.
It doesn't sound at all like her.
Things are changing very quickly.
Yeah?
What did Vidal say about the whole thing?
No... please.
I don't want to talk about it.
All right.
Today I want to forget it all... bullets, trenches... politics, killings, betrayals.
I want to feel human for a change.
Salut.
Salut.
Take off your shirt.
- What?
- Come on.
- Take off your shirt!
- All right, all right.
All right.
It's got buttons, you know.
Take care.
What's going on?
The police from the old days.
And now they are back.
No guns for us at the front... and here in Barcelona the police have guns sticking out of their arse.
I'll make some coffee.
Do you have some matches?
What?
No matches.
Yeah, there's some matches in my bag.
What is this?
What?
This?
We get no uniforms like this in the militia.
Look...
I meant to tell you.
I'm not in the militia any more.
I've joined the International Brigade.
I leave for Albacete on Friday.
Stalinist!
Come on.
Come on.
You vote!
You vote to keep the militia!
Yeah, but... things are different now.
I've changed my mind.
It's because of Lawrence?
No!
He left the day after!
No, it's not because of that!
I'm a member of the Communist Party.
I've never hidden it.
But you fought with us!
With the POUM!
Yeah, I fought with the POUM.
And look at the fuck that happened to me.
I've got a big piece of metal in my arm.
But you know perfectly well why!
You know they refuse us arms!
David!
The Stalinists are betraying the revolution!
I don't believe that.
Go to La Batalla.
Talk to them there.
I haven't got to talk to La Batalla.
I've been in hospital, I was talking to others.
Our leaders have been expelled from the government.
That's politics.
That's the way politics works.
No!
They are trying to ban us.
Say we are, we are social fascists!
And you know, you know this!
You know our papers are banned, journalists arrested and here they even talk about torture chambers.
Camaras de tortura!
I don't know that, do I?
I'll wait till I see it with my own eyes.
But you don't see it!
You don't want to see it.
Why you didn't tell me yesterday?
I was going to tell you.
I meant to tell you, just...
Liar!
Come on, look.
I've tried but...
Blanca...
I came to Spain to fight for socialism, to fight for the Republic!
And the best way I can think to do that is with the International Brigades.
And if, if what you're saying is true then I'm sure there's a good reason.
There's an explanation of some sort.
Of course it's true!
And there is an explanation.
It's called Stalinism!
Look, what are you going to do now?
I go back to the front, where my real comrades are.
Oh look, come on!
Blanca!
For fucks sake, Blanca.
Listen!
Blanca!
Look after yourself, will ya?
Please.
(GERMAN EAGLES ON GUERNICA BOMBS)
So that's why I'm in Barcelona.
It's dead complicated, Kit, and difficult to explain.
The problem is the struggle seems to be falling apart in front of our eyes.
No-one trusts anyone any more.
Anarchists and POUM are pulling one way, communists in another.
It's mad.
All I can do is believe the Party.
They must know what they're doing.
(Daily Worker:
JOINT PLANS TO BREAK MADRID FRONT)
The city is like a powder keg waiting to go off.
Trucks of assault guards everywhere.
And now there's trouble at the telephone exchange which is run by the anarchists.
The police just took it by force.
They say the anarchists are sabotaging the war effort by interfering with government business.
There's fighting in the streets, barricades going up all over the place.
There's shootings.
Comrades against comrades.
Fascist must be laughing their heads off.
Anyway, I just got orders to join the squad of government supporters.
It seems to be incented defending the Communist Party headquarters.
No choice.
I'm not looking forward to it.
David.
The attack of the telephone exchange is a declaration of war against the working class...
What are the POUM up to?
A general strike has been called in all industries except those producing weapons...
Plants, machine shops, warehouses... are stopping work.
The barricades of liberty have risen again in every part of town!
Arm yourselves to defend the revolution!
You should be killing fascists, not one another!
What are you saying?
We've got nothing to eat.
D'you hear?
We've got to put food on the table.
Please get out of the way.
Sorry, friend.
I'm sorry.
Bastards!
Hey, you, Stalin's sidekick.
What division were you in?
The Karl Marx Division.
And you?
The Third Division?
No, you bastard.
We're from the Durutti Division, the best.
You don't even know who's your enemy.
You idiots!
You idiots!
You have betrayed the revolution.
That's a lie.
You are the ones who have broken the anti-fascists front.
I've been at the front and I know.
Are you English?
Yeah.
You?
Where are you from?
Manchester.
Fucking hell, I'm from Liverpool.
What you doin' here?
Don't know.
Why aren't you over here with us?
Why aren't you over here with us?
I don't fucking know.
We can smell food, fascists.
What are you cooking, bastards?
Sausages and beans.
Are you hungry?
You bet!
Then here you are.
No more.
Never.
We're not enemies.
My friend, Martin, returned from the front dying of hunger.
It's a disaster.
- Which front?
- Aragon.
When it's decision time, everyone is the boss.
They say they don't even know how to load the guns.
Get away!
They say the militia women aren't killing fascists, they are fucking them instead!
They fuck them.
They do nothing.
They're crap.
They're a disaster, they take 4 totally inexperienced men.
That's a lie.
I'm from the front.
I'm in the militia.
You're in the militia?
You're in the militia?
He can't even speak properly.
What?
What are you saying?
Listen, you're a fucking kid.
You know fuck all.
Do you understand me?
Yes, a kid.
You don't know nothing.
You've seen fuck all.
What's going on?
Son of a bitch!
Quiet!
You fucking know-nothing, you little snotty-nosed little kid!
What's going on?
That's enough.
Are you mad, or what?
What do you think is going on?
If the leaders of the POUM and CNT get together, we're fucked.
That's what's happening!
They need to come from abroad to tell us that?
At least it's good that they're here.

Yeah.
Back from the dead.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Gone but not forgotten, eh?
Has vuelto?
Si.

Que tal, amigo?
Yeah.
Are you a spy of the communists?
Si.

You're welcome.
Good to see you.

Fucking shit, the woman's doing the cooking...
Hola, amiga!

David!
Si!
What are you doing here?
I came back for something to eat.
Oh, great!
I heard you'd taken over the cooking.
No, seriously, what happened?
No, seriously, what's on the menu?
- Seriously...
- Fucking beans!
Go to hell, Pigat.
It's terrible!
Hola.
Fine?
And you?
So-so.
What are you doing here?
Had to see with your own eyes?
Yeah.
I got to sort a lot of things with my own eyes.
Things I didn't want to see.
All right?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Yeah?
Si, si.
Yo tambien.
The Party stinks, Kit.
And I never thought the day'd come when I'd have to say that.
It's evil and corrupt.
In Barcelona I saw good comrades snatched off the streets and executed, others disappeared into torture chambers, and it's still going on.
Stalin is just using the working class like pieces on a chessboard to be bartered, used and sacrificed.
Things have changed while I've been away.
Some of the old faces are missing because they couldn't stomach all the in-fighting and all-in-all we've taken a bit of a battering.
It's rumoured we're going to make a big attack soon and still no weapons, no support.
But this one we're going to win.
Despite everything, our spirits are high.
Keep cover!
Viva!
Medico!
Medico!
We have had many casualties.
They're bombing us...
Listen... where's the cover you promised?
What kind of position is this?
Nobody's come.
You don't understand anything.
Nobody's come.
We can't hold on.
Those fucking Stalinist bastards.
This should have been over hours ago, mate.
They should have fucking taken that hill hours ago.
Trust them just to make a fucking point.
They've dumped us, Davey!
Madruga.
Si...
Ammunition!
Wait...
I'm waiting!
I'm not going anywhere, am I?
See, we're hemmed in here, mate.
They know where we are.
Where are they?
Where's the asaltos?
In fucking reserve!
We're fucked here...
We can't hold this position any longer.
We must stay here.
No.
We can't.
We don't have any weapons.
We don't have...
We must show them what we are, Bernard.
Listen, they know exactly what's happening here.
Nobody's sending arms or the army.
We will die alone, here, and you will do their game.
We are fighters.
Bernard, we are fighters!
It's an order.
We're fucked here...
- This is madness.
- You've got to hold on.
Yes, sir.
Retreat immediately.
Why are you giving me this order when you've just told me to hold the position?
All right?
I also want to know...
listen... why we've been risking our lives here waiting for the promised reinforcements.
All right?
Whatever you say, sir.
Madruga, Andres, come here!
And the rest, quickly.

Gene, what are you doing here?
Take it easy.
Bernard, keep everybody calm.
Stay where you are!
Quiet, everybody.

Listen.
Drop your weapons on the ground, immediately.
Obey the order!
- What's going on, Lawrence?
- Listen.
Es una orden.
What's the meaning of this?
Can we know why?
Officer, get your men to obey.
I refuse.
Obey my orders!
From now on this unit is disbanded.
You can all go home, except for the following who are under arrest.
Quiet!

Bernard Goujon,
Miguel Angel Campos,
Rafael Jimenez...
Ni locos...
What are we accused of?
The POUM is now illegal.
Your newspaper has been banned and your leaders arrested.
What charges?
Conspiring with the fascists and collaborating with Franco!
Is this conspiracy?
Is this conspiracy, Colonel?
Jesus!
It's a lie... it's a lie...
While we've been getting fucking shot...
Don't look at the ground, look at me face to face.
It's not a reflection on you, it's your leaders.
It's a Stalinist plot.
The fucking government's a load of bollocks!
Sietamo, what about Sietamo?
Alcubierre?
Come on, Gene, what about the people...
Lecinena?
Casetas de Quisena?
Tierz?
Navales?
They're all places liberated by the POUM.
Were they fascists who did that?
What about fucking Coogan and the others, who died?
Are we all fascists all of a sudden?
Were these places liberated by fascists, too?
It was the men of the POUM who defended Madrid.
Were these places liberated by Franco?
Quiet!
Obey my orders!
Prepare to fire!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
Quiet!
What shall we do with the wounded?
Madruga, quiet!
You're under arrest.
Do as he says.
What happened in Barcelona with our comrades?
Murderers!
They're going to shoot you...
Murderers!
Control your men, Captain.
Control your men, Captain.
Fight with us against fascism.
Fascist bastard, come here and say that face to face with us.
Come here.
Coward, coward, come here.
Blanca!
- They have to do this.
- Come here.
- Coward, come here!
- They have to do this.
You're being tricked.
You're being tricked by your own leaders!
- You're being lied to!
- Fight with us.
- They're tricking you.
- You are tricking us!
No, the leaders of the POUM are tricking you!
You are tricking us!
Lawrence, open your eyes!
Come here, coward.
They have proof.
Come here!
Come here!
Blanca...!
Silence...
You idiots.
God Almighty!
Silence...
Murderers...
Vidal...
What the fuck did you do that for?
We've fought for nothing, comrades.
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
You bastards...
Murderers...
Murderers...
We've fought for nothing, comrades.
Lower your guns.
Death to Stalinism!
Long live the revolution...
Open your eyes!
Long live the revolution.
Down with fascism.
Thank you very much.
We buried Blanca in collectivised land.
She would have liked that... even though the Stalinists came four weeks later and broke up the commune.
At least the earth belonged to her for a short while.
I'm trying to get home, Kit, but it won't be easy.
They have a "wanted" list and, as a so-called deserter and supporter of the POUM, my name's on it.
There are no "safe" houses and we spend our time hiding out in building sites and living rough.
Some of the most sincere and dedicated fighters against fascism have been murdered.
But if you get this letter... understand that I regret nothing.
Revolutions are contagious, and had we succeeded here - and we could have done - we would have changed the world.
But never mind, our day will come.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many, but we are more...
We shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
Can I just say something a minute?
The other day, I found this.
It was amongst, like, my grandad's papers.
And I just thought it was, like, fitting for him.
It's a poem by William Morris, and I'd just like to read it out.
"Join in the battle wherein no man can fail;
For whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deeds shall still prevail".
Wouldn't be on the first floor, would it?
Ambulance!
Yeah.
Yeah, here you are, love.
In 'ere.
It's the old fella.
He's collapsed on the couch.
Let's have a look at him, eh?
This is his grand-daughter.
You were here when this happened, were you?
Yeah, I just come in and found him on the couch.
What's his name?
Dave Carr.
Dave!
Dave!
Is he gonna be all right?
Dave?
Dave?
No response there, Dave.
No response, yeah...
How's he doing, love?
He's okay at the moment so let's just keep our fingers crosse.
Does he have any other close relatives at all?
There's my mum.
She lives in wales, so, I mean, she doesn't see him often
Her and me dad have split up.
Paul, make the hospital.
He's just gone on us, mate.
Oh, God!
Have we lost him?
Oh, God, Dot!
It's all right...
(THE MINER MORE PIT CLOSURES)
(The Socialist LABOURS' FIFTH COLUMN)
(SPANISH TROOPS REVOLT IN MOROCCO)
(THE DAILY WORKER)
(ALL INTO ACTION NOW!
DEFEND SPANISH REPUBLIC!
)
In February a coalition of socialist, republican and other left wing parties were victorious in the general election.
They proposed a series of democratic reforms.
The big landowners, industrialists, churchmen and army officers feared the growing power of the working class.
July 18th.
There was a military uprising led by the Fascist General Franco against the democratically elected government.
Government supporters formed militias to defend themselves.
Organised by trades unions and political parties, they went to fight for their democratic rights against the Fascists.
This, this is... this is the... one of the militias going to the Zaragosa front in, in Aragon.
You can see all the cars.
They've got the name of the workers' organisation... because they've all been nationalised, they've all been taken over by the workers.
That is the Union of, of the Railway workers.
This is the CNT... the anarchists' union.
As you can see... the support the whole of Barcelona is on the streets but with very few guns.
Most people haven't got guns.
You can see young, old, men, women.
These are the fascists.
The General, the defenders of privilege.
And this is what they are doing to us.
They are killed and left there... just for being trade unionists.
Every defeat for us is a defeat for you.
Every step that takes Franco closer to poser in Spain also takes the fascists closer to power here.
If Franco wins the war... it would be a major boost for fascists everywhere.
And before long, comrades... they will drag all freedom-loving people down to barbarism and, and war.
Comrades, whether Spanish or English, or American or Chinese we are one class of people with the same aspiration... the same hope for a just and equal society.
I want you to join with us... make our fight your fight.
Let's come together... let's come together...
Let's take up the slogan.
No Pasaran.
They shall not pass.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
You've got our support.
We're right behind you.
We wanna fight.

Kit...
I'm going to go to Spain.
What, just like that you're going to Spain?
Well, not just like that but...
It'll take a while to organise.
I'll go to Barcelona, sort it out from there.
Why you?
Why have you got to go?
Because I can.
I haven't got any kids or nothing.
I mean, you know... what am I doing here, Kit?
I'm on fifteen bob a week on the dole.
Y'know, there's millions of us, out of work.
I'm on, you know, demon-strations, hunger marches just...
I know.
I've been there with you.
I know.
But I want to do something.
And you can't do it here?
If we've got to do it, we've got to do it now.
We've got to stop them otherwise it's not, it's going to be too late, Kit.
We'll have no future here.
I can't spare you.
Come here.
Dear Kit... well I made it.
It was a bit tricky and the sea was rough.
I was glad to get off that ship.
But Larry, who smuggled me aboard, turned up trumps.
He got us ashore, in one piece, at Marseilles... and put us on the road to Spain.
And then I hitched a lift in a couple of lorries to the border.
It seems there's no organisation here to help volunteers like me you've just got to make your own way.
With no passport, crossing the frontier wasn't easy and I had to walk across the Pyrenees.
I must have climbed for miles.
My boots are all shot to pieces and my feet are steaming.
I was scared stiff but we made it.
Would you like to sit down?
Would you like to sit down?
Madam, could you please move the chickens?
Now I'm in Spain and everything is so bright it hurts your eyes.
I've 'copped' the train for Barcelona.
Maybe I'll see some action.
He said that they could use your feet as a weapon against Franco.
What do you do here?
Oh, I've come to fight for the Republic.
Good.
The more that come the sooner we'll win.

Hey, dickhead.
Make up your mind.
Shut up.
I'm in charge here.
I'm pissed off with this.
This is important pick it up immediately.
You pick it up.
I'm off.
Where are you going, love?
Don't call me "love".
Comrade, comrade...
I am going to Madrid.
Understand?
They take things seriously there.
This is vital for the revolution for both men and women.
We've got to have discipline we'll never win without it.
Where are we going going to get to with this...
This is just the beginning.
I want a gun.
You'll get to fight...
Please trust me...
Get back in the line... what are you lot gawking at?
Let's have some energy.
I've seen more life in a sick note.
Right!
Halt!
In Germany I was a pastry cook.
Pastry...
Yeah, pastry cook.
And you, Gene, what was your job?
Eleven years on the sea.
Bosun.
Bosun?
Yes.
I've just spent six days on the sea and it was not for me.
I was, went from Liverpool to Marseilles and I was sick all the time.
So...
I'm not a sailor.
I was a servant.
A cleaner.
Servant.
For an English family.
On the first day everything starts they went running to England so they left, they left me alone in Barcelona.
I'm free for the first time of my life.
Salud, camaradas.
Thank you, thank you.
You got the weapons?
Yes.
Antiques.
Antiques?
German, Mauser, 1896.
Single load.
How many?
Thirty.
Okay.
All right.
Be better using a big stick.
Okay.
Get these off and take them over there into the 'store place'.
When did you learn about guns?
Five years in French Army, I was sergeant.
Comrade.
Where you from?
Italiano.
Milano.
Italiano?
So you know fascism?
They're bastards.
Que?
Do you need some help?
No, I'll do it myself.
Vale, leona.
Aye, aye, soft ollies.
Are you taking the piss?
Want to change?
Come here!
Sit down.
Sit down, please.
Garibaldi, come here.
My name's Rafael Poccetti, Captain.
I know.
But I need Garibaldis more than I need Poccettis.
Sit down, please.
Leona, tu tambien.
Okay.
In the other side of the hill are the trenches.
Our trenches.
And beyond them is the enemy.
And the only good soldier in Franco's Army is a dead one.
My name is Vidal and I'm your Captain.
We are the POUM and we organise this section of the, of the front.
To the west of us are the anarchists.
And we fight together, comrades in arms to defeat, to destroy the fascists and make the workers' and peasants' revolution.
Understand?
Don't forget it.
You are welcome here because you are my speaking squad English.
Okay?
We are proud to have you fight with us in our side.
Hey, David...
look.
The whores are also at the front.
Yeah, but they're better looking than the ones back home.
Yeah?
Good morning, Coogan, your reinforcements are here now.
I thought it was Sunday.
Dear Kit.
Well, I'm a soldier now with the POUM Militia.
It's a People's Army.
Just ordinary men and women fighting for a cause not like the Army back home.
There's no saluting'.
We elect the officers, and everything's discussed and voted on
It's socialism in action.
I'm in a special section... it's mainly internationals but some Spainish... and the common language is English, so we get by.
An Irishman called Coogan is in charge.
We're all on the same pay ten pesetas a day which is kept for us for when we go on leave.
And we also get a packet of fags a day, which isn't bad.
It's a huge operation, about twenty thousand militia on this front alone.
I'm not in the communist brigade, but it doesn't matter cos we're all fightin' the same enemy.
Viva Franco!
Viva Espana!
Fascists bastards.
Rot in hell!
Sons of bitches!
Fascists, you've got no balls.
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse.
Hey, rich bastard, you'll die with nothing.
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse!
You must be used to this weather coming from your godforsaken town.
It never stops fuckin' raining!
You been, have you?
Yeah, five years, Manchester.
Staring at the poxy rain through prison bars.
What d'you get put down for?
Fightin' the Brits.
Murderer...
Murderer of a free nation.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
There's all sorts here...
French, German, Yanks, Spanish of course, and a Scot by the name of Jimmy.
All good lads.
The front line doesn't seem to move.
We watch the fascists, and they watch us.
Lots of hanging about waiting' for something to happen.
Digging trenches, going out on patrol, sentry duty.
But worst of all is the lice.
They're worse than the nits back home.
They send you mad.
They lay their eggs in the lining of your trousers and you can't get rid of 'em.
You're forever scratching.
The food's not great... it's usually bread and beans which gives us all a problem...
I could murder some cabbage and ribs.
The local women do the cooking.
It's strange to see women in the trenches fighting alongside the men.
But no need to worry, Kit, none of them could hold a candle to you.
Max...
You know what we said the other day when we came down... about Blanca being a whore.
You know, a prostitute.
Who?
Who?
Who?
You said that Blanca was a prostitute - a whore!
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Good one.
Good one?
Good one!
Yeah!
Yours are winding me up.
Everybody knows... except you.
Maite...?
True.
You know, David, Blanca has told me some stories... crazy ones.
Hard life...
Hard life... hard one!
In fact, Jose can tell you, you know.
He knows her very well, you know, because...
She knows how to do it... she's good and cheap.
Good and cheap, yeah.
Leave him alone.
David, it's the right moment.
Listen, she likes you, I tell you.
Good luck!
All right?
Yeah.
Do you want a cigarette?
No, thanks.
So, I mean, I was just thinking if you're not busy later on you might want to... you know, go for a walk with me.
You know...
I don't understand you.
Maybe me and you, you know, like... with, with Coogan.
When we saw you the other day...
Coogan is my man.
D'you understand?
Yeah.
Si.
Before the war we live together.
We join in the militia together.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got...
we fight together.
Sorry about that.
Sorry.
Yeah.
I'll see you later then.
You shower of bastards!
You...
I'll have a fuckin' word with you in a minute!
Have a nice time?
Have a nice time?
Yes, I did, thank you very much.
Marcel!
David?
Look.
Uh?
Fascist prisoners.
No!
An officer as well.
How many?
Besides the officer, there's...
Lawrence, Coogan, Jimmy.
I wonder where they found them?
I dunno.
This fucking senora wants a word with you.
Him and his sons, we found them behind the lines.
Doing a recce or something.
Anyway, they were lost.
At ease.
What's your name, lad?
Jose.
Jose?
Are you hungry?
Take them and get them something to eat, Jim.
And where are you going?
I've some questions for you.
I don't have to answer.
I'm a professional soldier.
Support the government elected by the people.
It's not a real government.
Muy bien...
How many soldiers in your command?
Have you got machine-guns?
Artillery?
Do your soldiers obey you?
Of course... we're a real army.

Mail.
No.
No.
No.
Sorry.
Coogan, over here.
Oh, great.
Pigat...
Are you alright?
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Leave me alone.
I want to go home.
What's wrong?
I'm going home, okay?
Why?
I've got things to sort out.
You're crazy... you can't just leave like this.
I came here willingly and I'll leave when I feel like it, okay?
No, it's not that easy.
You can't just go when you want to.
There's a discipline here.
My woman's fucking another man.
Who'll sort it out?
You?
Vidal?
Okay.
What are you going to do?
String the son of a bitch up by his balls.
And what good would that do?
Tell me, what good would that do?
Make me feel better.
Stay here... with your companeros.
I came here for her, for my daughter, the future.
You've got a daughter?
She was two last month.
What's her name?
Lidia.
Look...
If we don't win this war there'll be no future for anybody.
Right?
Not for Lidia, not for your wife, not you, not me, not anyone.
Do you understand?
The photos'll give you some idea of how cold it was.
But what they don't show is how the rain turned everything into freezing mud.
We seemed to spend all our time searching for firewood anything that'd burn and keep us warm.
This Coogan fella's a bit of a wild one.
Ex-IRA.
He's always first on patrol and last one back.
He knows what he's doing, but he does take chances.
His girlfriend's called Blanca.
She's in our section.
She's a bit of a character an' all.
Sharp as a razor.
They're not always hanging on to one another, but everyone knows they're a couple.
The worst thing about being here is doing nothing.
It seems we're just sittin' around and talkin' and arguing' politics all the time.
I come all this way to fight fascists and I can't get to grips with them.
Still... at last things are warming up a bit, not just the weather either.
Tomorrow's a big day.
We're attacking a village held by the fascists.
Think of us.
Lots of love, David.
Take off your sacks!
Vamos alla, valientes!
David, come on!
What's going on?
No!
No!
Chuck us a cartridge.
Hey, chuck us a fucking cartridge!
There's women down there!
Danny, you can't be serious.
Give us a fucking cartridge!
Danny, you can't put their lives in danger.
Coogan!
Coogan!
Fuego!
Don't shoot!
Speak to me!
Speak to me.
Speak to me!
This is the pig that was shooting from the tower.
Quiet!
Su rifle aun esta caliente.
I'm going to ask one simple question.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
Tell me the truth.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
There's the proof.
What's this then?
Kill him!
He informed on five comrades from the Union, and they're dead now.
Yeah, kill him.
What happened?
They took my husband and shaved my head.
Why?
Why?
Because my husband was in the militia.
Y no lo pudieren coger.
Eran anarquistas.
They were young anarchists.
Somebody say to the priest in confession where they were.
He told this to the fascists.
He knew the fascists kill them.
Murderer!
We've got to kill him.
Delato a nuestros companeros!
And we'll see you in three days...
Two or three days.
I'll stay here with twenty men for three days.
Very nice indeed.
Very nice.
I'm happy you appreciate French good taste.
Hola chico!
Gracias, amiga.
Blanca...
I just want you to know how sorry I am for what happened.
I should have opened fire but I didn't and, and they got him.
That's all there is to it.
The thing is, he was a good man.
You know, he was a brave man.
We're all going to miss him.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I...
Oh, come on... come on... when I met him the first time... he was playing... how do you say...
The guitar?
No.
Yeah, the smaller one.
Banjo?
Yeah.
He was playing banjo.
In bars and cafes.
I'm sorry, Blanca, you know, it's my fault.
And I...
No.
No, I'm...
I'm responsible because...
No.
You didn't kill him.
Fascists did.
He said he just wanted, like, bullets and I said that, like, I wouldn't...
It could have happened sooner or later to any of us.
We feel a great sorrow today, but it must not halt our efforts.
Our companions have not died in vain.
Josefina, Sebastian, Teresa all of you we all fight for the same things as they did.
And we shall continue it's what they would have wanted.
They're here with us, fighting for the same cause.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many.
But we are more, we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
The struggle goes on.
They shall no pass.
We shall overcome.
Viva la revolucion!
Viva!
Muerte al fascismo!
Muerte!
Come on, sit down...
Friends...
Don Julian's house is now the house of the people.
Let's start the meeting.
Who's going to speak?
Teresa.
We must collectivise.
The men at the front have no food and the people in the village have been left with next to nothing by the fascists.
The village hasn't got enough food.
We must collectivise as soon as possible.
We must get food to feed our people and the comrades fighting for us at the front.
I'm in agreement with the collectivisation of Don Julian's lands or re-distribution in all its forms, but each to his own little bit...
no?
Wait...
Jose, speak.
I work my land my own way... it's not much, all that I have...
I started working it and... shit...
I've thrown everything into it.
Miguel.
What would you like to say?
I'd like to say to our friend here that it's very good that he wants to work his own land, but how much better it would be if we all worked it together.
When the harvest is ready, are you going to eat all the wheat and all the potatoes?
You are not to say so... we need everything to be able... to keep the revolution going.
The revolution has to be done this way.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
Jose, it's not only a question of land.
Hay que hacer una sociedad nueva!
Un momento, Miguel, que Aniceto habia...
Yo habia pedido la palabra, y a nosotros nos dejais de lado.
The revolution is like a pregnant cow, if we don't help out... the cow and its calf will be gone and the children will be left hungry.
Remember that comrades, boys, died in this battle.
We must collectivise.
Do you understand me?
The people must eat.
This struggle we've started has to continue.
There are those who are the way they are and there are those who know how to work and people who don't...
I've got what I've got because I work.
Hold on.
Paco's turn.
It's fundamental that improve our harvests... we must grow more.
Othere villages have done it by working all the land as one.
With a tractor you can do five times more work in one day than you can with a mule.
Un momento.
No hablemos todos juntos.
Un momento.
Sebastian.
There's evidence from other villages that it's working.
I believe we have to take over private property.
No one's got anything.
We could pool all our resources and depending on each person's situation we could share it out.
If you need a cow, you'll get one.
We've all got four or five kids... and we've all buse a gut working, just like you.
Hey!
Momento!
Momento, companeros... we've got militia comrades here who may know what's happening elsewhere... they've helped us here.
Teresa...
Pepe's right.
Our friends from the militia will have seen what's happened in other villages.
This is an open meeting you can speak, too.
Your opinions are as welcome as any of ours.
Please speak.
It's your village.
You have to decide.
It's your decision.
Okay, this is what I think, and if anybody disagrees they should just say so right out.
Si.
Okay.
You should take this estate, this house, this land and divide it up amongst the people in the town right away.
Okay.
The decree passed by the Republican Government in October allows for that.
Okay.
It says all property owned by individuals involved in the insurrection will be confiscated.
Si, si.
The problem's different here... all the landowners help Franco.
We must collectivize all the lands.
You understand?
Todas las tierras, hay que colectivizar no solo dividir.
I understand that.
I understand that.
I'm not, I'm not a friend of the landowner.
Okay?
I'm not here to defend landowners.
Okay?
But what are you going to do when you have a guy like, what's his name, Pepe?
What are you going to do when you have a guy like Pepe who has... he's a tenant farmer and he has a couple of acres of land... or a tradesman who doesn't want to be part of your collective?
Okay?
These people are anti-fascists.
What do you do then?
It sounds really great on paper, but in reality it won't work... because it's going to pit the peasants against the anti-fascists.
Okay?
You're fighting now and it's going to endanger your food production.
Lawrence, I think that private ownership of land must be totally given up, forgotten, cancelled... because it maintains people in a capitalist mentality.
I agree.
Okay.
I agree with, I mean,
I'm not here to argue for, for private property.
I know the definition of private property.
I know what it does.
Okay, I'm not arguing that.
This is not the time for these textbook arguments on socialism or land reform.
We have to defeat fascism, that's the priority.
Are you suspecting this man to, to speak about the textbook of... socialism?
No, I'm not!
Well, I'm, I'm agreeing with him.
Okay?
I'm agreeing with the collectivisation, all right?
But these people cannot collectivise anything if they're dead.
Okay?
Well, this is, is your opinion.
My opinion!
They asked for my opinion.
No, but in my village, the people didn't wait for the government to give them the land.
They took it themselves.
Nadie espero a que les dijesen que tenian que hacer con la tierra, la cogieron ellos mismos.
I want you to think beyond this village, okay at a much bigger picture.
Okay.
I have no doubt that the Spanish people, on their own, could have 'licked' Franco.
But you're not fighting just Franco, you now have Mussolini and Hitler on your back.
Okay.
With the exception of Russia and Mexico... the rest of the world has turned its back on you.
Okay?
They refuse to sell the Republic arms.
Okay.
These are capitalists, these are capitalist countries!
They're capitalist countries, and if you want their help you have to moderate your slogans cos you're scaring them away!
I'm from Germany.
We wanted revolution and what happened?
We'd been the strongest movement in Europe... the best organised workers' movement.
There were six million of us in unions and what happened?
Hitler...
The socialists and the communists told us... to make our revolution later.
But I say make the revolution now.
When people see as the village sees that you can be in charge of your life, your land, when collectivisation becomes a reality, it'll be possible for people in Germany, Italy, to follow our example.
These people think they have, they think they have something, but they have nothing!
But we have to show to the people that, that we have... we're poor but we're alive and we've got power now, we don't have to be seized by fear.
We're alive, we'll die when our time comes, but...
All French working people are, are looking to us in Spain, probably all around the world and I think it is not the right time to fight, to fight each other but together.
Now all of us know the price of the freedom and we, we've lost a lot of friends.
Gene, your kedas are very seductive but I've got one question for you.
Who are you trying to appease... foreign governments, foreign bankers?
What is a revolution?
It's nothing other than a radical change in privilege, wealth and power.
What's going to happen, what'...
the only way we'll appease, the only way we'll appease these people when the ideas are diluted and watered down till they mean absolutely nothing.
Now I think you're dead right when you say when you say that they must look beyond this village, and must look at what's happening outside.
Okay, but not only to foreign bankers and foreign governments.
What we must look to as well is that outside these windows, as we speak, on this land are two million landless peasants.
From the day they were born they had absolutely no hope other than a life of misery.
And unless we harness that energy now the ideas will be dead, there'll be no change and this will all be in vain.
Ideas are the basis of this.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, those people will be dead never mind the ideas!
If Franco comes in, you know, if Franco wins this war he'll just kill a million of those people.
They're nothing to him.
They're just a piece of shit!
That's obvious, I agree with that.
Exactly.
So, unless we win the war, there's no point in having the ideology.
The ideology does not exist in, in like, in a book.
It exists, has to exist in place.
It'd have to be real, for real people.
I say that we have to take risks.
What do we do?
Misery, hunger, hopelessness.
Franco might come back and kill us but I say it's worth it to continue collectivising and improving the quality of our lives.
Let's vote!
All those in favour of collectivisation.
All those against.
Friends, the vote is to collectivise the land.
You all right?
Want a hand?
Yeah.
I thought maybe your foot was hurtin'.
It's okay, thank you.
No problem.
Hola.
Hola.
And you talk about being poor.
Who?
You.
With Coogan that night.
We were just talking about when we were kids.
I tell you what poor is.
Two pesetas a day for agricultural labours if you're lucky.
Peasant families living in caves or sandpits that is poor.
That is why we need the revolution.
Don't laugh!
I'm not laughing.
I saw you!
I wasn't laughing!
D'you want a hand with that?
Oh, I can see you've got one.
Don't say any more!
What I'm saying, Kit, is that I'm not the man I was.
I feel like I'm standing on higher ground, if you see what I mean.
I can see further and, and I notice things I hadn't even thought of before.
Like I, I left Liverpool with a daft romantic idea but in war people get killed.
Fellas like Coogan... and the women and kids who died in this village that's all part of me now and I'll never shake it off.
Fascist planes dropped leaflets on us yesterday saying how they was winning the war.
Well, myself, it's hard to know what's going on in the rest of Spain.
But here, on the Aragon front, we're holding our own.
And if only we had decent arms.
Who knows?
Perhaps a line of Russian tanks will come rolling over the hill.
Some hope, eh?
Pigat, Garibaldi, Roca...
Listen...
Max...
Come here.
Companeros, listen please.
I have to go to the Command Post for a very important meeting with the General Staff of the Column.
And I say, very important because we are going to discuss about our integration in the new Popular Army.
There is no choice.
The government in Valencia says no more militia and say we all must become part in the new communist led Popular Army.
Okay?
So, if we refuse they continue to withhold arms.
To keep arms from us.
Do you understand?
Let's take a vote, no?
Votamos?
I have something to say, please.
Please.
Excuse me a moment, please.
This is probably the last time that we can vote on something as a militia.
All right?
Please.
Maybe we could integrate to the new Popular Army and get the weapons join together and be still in the militia too.
You're a dreamer, Pigat.
It's impossible.
Look, I think we have, we have to try to see the reality of the situation here.
Okay?
Who's ever gonna give us guns, the Russians or whomever they're not going to give them to us if they don't think that we know how to use them and that we're not properly trained.
So it makes sense that the best training is going to come from a regular disciplined army.
That's obvious.
I can't see what's wrong with that at all.
Everything is wrong.
The creation of the new army with its saluting and discipline and military hierarchy will destroy the revolutionary spirit of the people.
Okay?
And it's exactly what Stalinists expect.
What?
That makes no sense, Bernard.
Absolutely.
The Communist Party was set up for revolution.
Why would they want to suppress the revolutionary spirit?
It is no more revolutionary.
Look, the militia is the heart of the struggle.
Stalin fears us because he wants to sign treaties with the west and he already did, did it with France.
So, to sign treaties, to reach an agreement... he needs to be respectable and reassuring.
Okay?
So, if he supports us and the revolution we are making... he will lost his... respectability.
That's the reason why we are a real threat for Stalin and also for the other countries.
I don't know, Bernard, I... what you are saying might be right, I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay.
But I do know we're not going to win this war with a bunch of amateurs.
You may be an amateur, I'm not!
Jesus Christ!
We've done, we've done okay up, up to now, Gene.
We could have done better with guns.
We saved Valencia, Madrid, Barcelona... and we lost Toledo, Malaga and more... we've got to be clear about one thing here.
There's blackmail going on.
If we accept those arms, they come with conditions.
They're not interested in partners, they want stooges.
Let's vote...
Let them know what we think.
Do we support our General Stafe when they insist on keeping our own revolutionary organisations?
Si?
Everybody?
Si.
It's a clear majority.
Now watch.
Put the bullet in here.
Yes?
Understand?
That's it.
You take off the catch and it's ready for firing.
Si...
Come on then, "Mr Laurel".
Remarkable resemblance.
Remarkable.
Even down to the blank expression.
There you go.
You need to hold the rifle harder against your shoulder.
Fire.
Whey!
How's your shoulder?
You're afraid of the rifle.
Si.
Yes.
Hold it firmly like this.
You mustn't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze it like a woman's tits.
Understand?
Have you ever squeezed a woman's tits?
Yeah.
Yes?
I'll bet you have.
Hold on a minute.
Fuck!
Come quickly.
I know.
Are you okay?
Get a stick.
A stick!
Hey, hey, try to keep calm.
Is he all right?
Yeah, yeah!
I'm all right!
We must get him to the hospital.
What happened?
What happened?
Fucking rifle blew up in my face.
Jesus!
Piece of shit!
Jesus!
Are you satisfied now?
This is the shitty equipment you voted for!
Don't you have anything better to say?
Please give him some peace.
Don't you see?
Yeah, I can see.
I see a stupid idealist with a death wish.
Can't you see what's going on here?
It's over!
It's kaput!
It's finished.
Jesus, easy, easy man!
Oh fuck!
I've had it!
I cannot stay here watching people die of stupidity!
I can't do it!
I've had it!
I'm getting out of this!
Fuck it!
David, if you had any fucking brains you'd do the exact same thing!
Davey, let me see your eyes.
Are your eyes okay?
Yeah.
Oh, you daft bastard!
How's that?
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
Easy...
How far is this place?
About four miles.
They patch you up and send you to the hospital in Barcelona.
When you get out of the hospital... you'll need somewhere to rest for a while before you come back.
Yeah.
I know a place, a pension in Barcelona where the people from the POUM stay.
Would you like the address?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.
You stay there yourself, this pension?
Yeah, sometimes.
I know the old lady.
You stay there.
Tell her my name.
I will.
I'll say: "Blanca sent me.
Can you give me a nice room, please?".
Look after yourself, Blanca.
I'll see you soon.
Is this boarding house around here?
The Pension Adela?
Hello.
Do you have a room for me?
Who are you?
My friend Blanca sent me...
I like having English people, they are clean and tidy.
This is my room?
This is yours.
Si.
Hola.
Hello.
How are you?
Great.
What are you doing here?
You're not pleased to see me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just shocked.
How's your arm?
Oh, it's much better now.
I had the stitches taken out two days ago.
What are you doing here?
Bernard gave me seven days leave.
I thought I would surprise you.
You definitely have, without doubt.
I bought some wine.
It's on the table.
I'll be with you in a minute.
All right, yeah.
Help yourself.
Pour a glass for me.
Si, claro!
Please.
How's Bernard?
He's fine.
You know.
Women aren't allowed to fight any more.
New rules.
Yeah, I heard.
I can be a nurse.
I can drive a truck.
I can be a cook.
But I mustn't shoot a gun any more.
I must know my place as a woman.
Maite is going to be a cook.
No!
Yes.
She will... she will be the worst in the militia.
Well that's without doubt.
It doesn't sound at all like her.
Things are changing very quickly.
Yeah?
What did Vidal say about the whole thing?
No... please.
I don't want to talk about it.
All right.
Today I want to forget it all... bullets, trenches... politics, killings, betrayals.
I want to feel human for a change.
Salut.
Salut.
Take off your shirt.
What?
Come on.
Take off your shirt!
All right, all right.
All right.
It's got buttons, you know.
Take care.
What's going on?
The police from the old days.
And now they are back.
No guns for us at the front... and here in Barcelona the police have guns sticking out of their arse.
I'll make some coffee.
Do you have some matches?
What?
No matches.
Yeah, there's some matches in my bag.
What is this?
What?
This?
We get no uniforms like this in the militia.
Look...
I meant to tell you.
I'm not in the militia any more.
I've joined the International Brigade.
I leave for Albacete on Friday.
Stalinist!
Come on.
Come on.
You vote!
You vote to keep the militia!
Yeah, but... things are different now.
I've changed my mind.
It's because of Lawrence?
No!
He left the day after!
No, it's not because of that!
I'm a member of the Communist Party.
I've never hidden it.
But you fought with us!
With the POUM!
Yeah, I fought with the POUM.
And look at the fuck that happened to me.
I've got a big piece of metal in my arm.
But you know perfectly well why!
You know they refuse us arms!
David!
The Stalinists are betraying the revolution!
I don't believe that.
Go to La Batalla.
Talk to them there.
I haven't got to talk to La Batalla.
I've been in hospital, I was talking to others.
Our leaders have been expelled from the government.
That's politics.
That's the way politics works.
No!
They are trying to ban us.
Say we are, we are social fascists!
And you know, you know this!
You know our papers are banned, journalists arrested and here they even talk about torture chambers.
Camaras de tortura!
I don't know that, do I?
I'll wait till I see it with my own eyes.
But you don't see it!
You don't want to see it.
Why you didn't tell me yesterday?
I was going to tell you.
I meant to tell you, just...
Liar!
Come on, look.
I've tried but...
Blanca...
I came to Spain to fight for socialism, to fight for the Republic!
And the best way I can think to do that is with the International Brigades.
And if, if what you're saying is true then I'm sure there's a good reason.
There's an explanation of some sort.
Of course it's true!
And there is an explanation.
It's called Stalinism!
Look, what are you going to do now?
I go back to the front, where my real comrades are.
Oh look, come on!
Blanca!
For fucks sake, Blanca.
Listen!
Blanca!
Look after yourself, will ya?
Please.
(GERMAN EAGLES ON GUERNICA BOMBS)
So that's why I'm in Barcelona.
It's dead complicated, Kit, and difficult to explain.
The problem is the struggle seems to be falling apart in front of our eyes.
No-one trusts anyone any more.
Anarchists and POUM are pulling one way, communists in another.
It's mad.
All I can do is believe the Party.
They must know what they're doing.
JOINT PLANS TO BREAK MADRID FRONT
The city is like a powder keg waiting to go off.
Trucks of assault guards everywhere.
And now there's trouble at the telephone exchange which is run by the anarchists.
The police just took it by force.
They say the anarchists are sabotaging the war effort by interfering with government business.
There's fighting in the streets, barricades going up all over the place.
There's shootin's.
Comrades against comrades.
Fascist must be laugh that, that's all.
David.
The attack of the telephone exchange is a declaration of war against the working class... what are the POUM up to?
A general strike has been called in all industries except those producing weapons...
Plants, machine shops, warehouses... are stopping work.
The barricades of liberty have risen again in every part of town!
Arm yourselves to defend the revolution!
You should be killing fascists not one another!
What are you saying?
We've got nothing to eat.
D'you hear?
We've got to put food on the table.
Please get out of the way.
Sorry, friend.
I'm sorry.
Bastards!
Hey, you, Stalin's sidekick.
What division were you in?
The Karl Marx Division.
And you?
The Third Division?
No, you bastard.
We're from the Durutti Division, the best.
You don't even know who's your enemy.
You idiots!
You idiots!
You have betrayed the revolution.
That's a lie.
You are the ones who have broken the anti-fascists front.
I've been at the front and I know.
Are you English?
Yeah.
You?
Where are you from?
Manchester.
Fucking hell, I'm from Liverpool.
What you doin' here?
Don't know.
Why aren't you over here with us?
Why aren't you over here with us?
I don't fucking know.
We can smell food, fascists.
What are you cooking, bastards?
Sausages and beans.
Are you hungry?
You bet!
Then here you are.
No more.
Never.
We're not enemies.
My friend, Martin, returned from the front dying of hunger.
It's a disaster.
Which front?
Aragon.
When it's decision time, everyone is the boss.
They say they don't even know how to load the guns.
Get away!
They say the militia women aren't killing fascists, they are fucking them instead!
They fuck them.
They do nothing.
They're crap.
They're a disaster, they take 4 totally inexperienced men.
That's a lie.
I'm from the front.
I'm in the militia.
You're in the militia?
You're in the militia?
He can't even speak properly.
What?
What are you saying?
Listen, you're a fucking kid.
You know fuck all.
Do you understand me?
Yes, a kid.
You don't know nothing.
You've seen fuck all.
What's going on?
Son of a bitch!
Quiet!
You fucking know-nothing, you little snotty-nosed little kid!
What's going on?
That's enough.
Are you mad, or what?
What do you think is going on?
If the leaders of the POUM and CNT get together, we're fucked.
That's what's happening!
They need to come from abroad to tell us that?
At least it's good that they're here.
Lazarus.
Yeah.
Back from the dead.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Gone but not forgotten, eh?
Has vuelto?
Si.
Roca!
Andres!
Que tal amigo?
Yeah.
Are you a spy of the communists?
Si.
Fucking English.
You're welcome.
Good to see you.
We have a new cook now.
Maite!
Maite!
Fucking shit, the woman's doing the cooking...
Hola, amigo!
David!
David!
Si!
What are you doing here?
I came back for something to eat.
Oh great!
I heard you'd taken over the cooking.
No, seriously, what happened?
No, seriously, what's on the menu?
Seriously...
Fucking beans!
Go to hell, Pigat.
It's terrible!
Hola.
Fine.
And you?
So so.
What are you doing here?
Did you see with your own eyes?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I saw a lot of things with my own eyes.
Things I didn't want to see.
All right?
Yeah...
Bueno.
Amiga.
I'm glad to see you again.
Si, si.
Yo tambien.
The party stinks, Kit.
And I never thought the day'd come when I'd have to say that.
It's evil and corrupt.
In Barcelona I saw good comrades snatched off the streets and executed others disappeared into torture chambers, and it's still going on.
Stalin is just using the working class like pieces on a chessboard to be bartered, used and sacrificed.
Things have changed while I've been away.
Some of the old faces are missing because they couldn't stomach all the in-fighting and all-in-all we've taken a bit of a battering.
It's rumored we're going to make a big attack soon and still no weapons, no support.
But this one we're going to win.
Despite everything, our spirits are high.
Keep cover!
Viva!
Medico!
Medico!
We have had many casualties.
They're bombing us...
Liste... where's the cover you promised?
What kind of position is this?
Nobody's come.
You don't understand anything.
Nobody's come.
We can't hold on.
Those fucking Stalinist bastards.
This should have been over hours ago, mate.
They should have fucking taken that hill hours ago.
Trust them just to make a fucking point.
They've dumped us, Davey!
Madruga.
Si...
Ammunition!
Wait...
I'm waiting!
I'm not going anywhere, am I?
See we're hemmed in here, mate.
They know where we are.
Where are they?
Wher's the asaltos?
Never mind in fucking reserve!
We're fucked here... we can't hold this position any longer.
We must stay here.
No.
We can't.
We don't have any weapons.
We don't have... we must show them what we are, Bernard.
Listen, they know exactly what's happening here.
Nobody's sending arms or the army.
We will die alone, here, and you will do their game.
We are fighters.
Bernard, we are fighters!
It's an order.
We're fucked here...
This is madness.
You've got to hold on.
Yes, sir.
Retreat immediately.
Why are you giving me this order when you've just told me to hold the position?
All right?
I also want to know...
listen... why we've been risking our lives here waiting for the promised reinforcements.
All right?
Whatever you say, sir.
Madruga, Andres, come here and the rest, quickly.
Garibaldi, Roca, we're going back to our old positions.
Come on, Roca.
Bernard, to the left with Jimmy.
David, cover this flank.
Come on!
Quickly, orderly, orderly...
go with them...
Come on, David.
All of you get back.
Come on... back...
Come on...
My fucking leg!
Blanca, come here.
Orderly.
Orderly, there's a bad one, quick!
Stay with them.
Come on, Jimmy!
Be brave.
Oh, my leg!
Mira, mira, the cavalry have come.
If they've come to fight, they're a bit late for that one, aren't they?
Hey, Gene.
Gene!
Gene... what are you doing here?
Gene, what are you doing here?
Take it easy.
Bernard, keep everybody calm.
Stay where you are!
Quiet, everybody.
What the hell's going on?
Listen.
Drop your weapons on the ground, immediately.
Obey the order!
What's going on, Lawrence?
Listen.
Es una orden.
What's the meaning of this?
Can we know why?
Officer, get your men to obey.
I refuse.
Obey my orders!
From now on this unit is disbanded.
You can all go home, except for the following who are under arrest.
Quiet!
Juan Vidal
Bernard Goujon
Miguel Angel Campos
Rafael Jimenez
Ni locos... what are we accused of?
The POUM is now illegal.
Your newspaper has been banned and your leaders arrested.
What charges?
Conspiring with the fascists... collaborating with Franco!
Is this conspiracy?
Is this conspiracy, Colonel?
Jesus!
It's a lie... it's a lie... while we've been getting fucking shot...
Don't look at the ground look at me face to face.
It's not a relection on you it's your leaders.
It's a Stalinist plot.
The fucking government's a load of bollocks!
Sietamo, what about Sietamo?
Alcubierre?
Come on, Gene, what about the people...
Lecinena?
Casetas de Quisena?
Tierz?
Navales?
They're all places liberated by the POUM.
Were they fascists who did that?
What about fucking Coogan and the others, who died?
Are we all fascists all of a sudden?
Were these places liberated by fascists, too?
It was the men of the POUM who defended Madrid.
Were these places liberated by Franco?
Quiet!
Obey my orders!
Prepare to fire!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
Quiet!
What shall we do with the wounded?
Madruga, quiet!
You're under arrest.
Do as he says.
What happened in Barcelona with our comrades?
Murderers!
They're going to shoot you...
Murderers!
Control your men, Captian.
Control your men, Captian.
Fight with us against fascism.
Fascist bastard, come here and say that face to face with us.
Come here.
Coward, coward, come here.
Blanca!
They have to do this.
Come here.
Coward, come here!
They have to do this.
You're being tricked.
You're being tricked by your own leaders!
You're being lied to!
Fight with us.
They're tricking you.
You are tricking us!
No, the leaders of the POUM are tricking you!
You are tricking us!
Lawrence, open your eyes!
Come here, coward.
They have proof.
Come here!
Come here!
Blanca...!
Silence...
You idiots.
God Almighty!
Silence...
Murderers...
Vidal... what the fuck did you do that for?
We've fought for nothing, comrades.
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
You bastards...
Murderers...
Murderers... we've fought for nothing, comrades.
Lower your guns.
Death to Stalinism!
Long live the revolution...
Open your eyes!
Long live the revolution.
Down with fascism.
Thank you very much.
We buried Blanca in collectivised land.
She would have liked that... even though the Stalinists came four weeks later and broke up the commune.
At least the earth belonged to her for a short while.
I'm trying to get home, Kit, but it won't be easy.
They have a "wanted" list ad, as a so-called deserter and supporter of the POUM, my name's on it.
There are no "safe" houses and we spend our time hiding out in building sites and living rough.
Some of the most sincere and dedicated fighters against fascism have been murdered.
But if you get this letter... understand that I regret nothing.
Revolutions are contagious, and had we succeeded here... and we could have done.
We would have changed the world.
But never mind... our day will come.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many, but we are more... we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
Can I just say something a minute?
The other day, I found this.
It was amongst, like, my granddad's papers.
And I just thought it was, like, fitting for him.
It's a poem by William Morris, and I'd just like to read it out.
"Join in the battle"
"wherein no man can fail"
"For whoseo fadeth and dieth"
"Yet his deeds shall all still prevail"
Would you like to sit down?
Madam, could you please move the chickens?
Good.
The more that come, the sooner we'll win.
Do you want a drop?
Tickets, please.
He's with us, boss.
He's come to fight the fascists.
—Hey, dickhead.
Make up your mind.
—Shut up.
I'm in charge here.
—I'm pissed off with this.
—This is important.
Pick it up immediately.
—You pick it up.
I'm off.
—Where are you going, love?
Don't call me "love".
Comrade.
I am going to Madrid.
Understand?
They take things seriously there.
This is vital for the revolution, for both men and women.
We've got to have discipline.
We'll never win without it.
Where are we going to get to with this?
This is just the beginning.
—I want a gun.
—You'll get to fight please trust me.
Get back in the line.
What are you lot gawking at?
Let's have some energy.
I've seen more life in a sick note.
Right!
Halt!
My name's Raffaele Poccetti, Captain.
Fascist bastards.
Rot in hell!
Sons of bitches!
Fascists—you've got no balls.
The food here's fucking brilliant.
Hey, rich bastard, you'll die with nothing.
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse!
Murderers ...
—What's your name, lad?
—José.
José.
Are you hungry?
And where are you going?
—I've got some questions for you.
—I don't have to answer.
I'm a professional soldier.
Support the government elected by the people.
It's not a real government.
How many soldiers in your command?
Have you got machine guns?
Artillery?
Do your soldiers obey you?
Of course.
We're a real army.
No.
Sorry.
Coogan, over here.
Pigat?
Are you all right?
Where are you going?
—What's wrong?
—Leave me alone.
I want to go home.
What's wrong?
—I'm going home, OK?
—Why?
I've got things to sort out.
You're crazy.
You can't just leave like this.
I came here willingly and I'll leave when I feel like it, OK?
No, it's not that easy.
You can't just go when you want to.
There's a discipline here.
Listen, my woman's fucking another man.
Who'll sort it out?
You?
Vidal?
OK.
—What are you going to do?
—String the son of a bitch up by his balls.
And what good would that do?
Tell me, what good would that do?
Make me feel better.
Stay here, with your companions.
I came here for her.
For my daughter.
For the future.
You've got a daughter?
She was two last month.
—What's her name?
—Lidia.
Look, if we don't win this war, there'll be no future for anybody.
Right?
Not for Lidia, not for your wife, not you, not me, not anyone.
Do you understand?
This is the pig that was shooting from the tower.
Quiet.
I'm going to ask one simple question.
Have you fired this rifle?
—No.
—Tell me the truth.
Have you fired this rifle?
—There's the proof.
—What's this, then?
Kill him!
He informed on five comrades from the Union, and they're dead now.
What happened?
They took my husband and shaved my head.
Why?
Because my husband was in the militia.
Murderer!
And we'll see you in three days ....
Two or three days ....
We feel a great sorrow today, but it must not halt our efforts.
Our companions have not died in vain.
Josefina, Sebastián, Teresa, all of you, we all fight for the same thing as they did.
And we shall continue.
It's what they would have wanted.
They're here with us, fighting for the same cause.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades.
And from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long, and our foes are many.
But we are more.
We shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
The struggle goes on.
They shall not pass.
We shall overcome.
Come on, sit down ....
Friends.
Don Julian's house is now the house of the people.
Let's start the meeting.
Who's going to speak?
—Teresa.
—We must collectivise.
The men at the front have no food and the people in the village have been left with next to nothing by the fascists.
The village hasn't got enough food.
We must collectivise, as soon as possible.
We must get food to feed our people and the comrades fighting for us at the front.
I'm in agreement with the collectivisation of Don Julian's lands, or re-distribution in all its forms, but each to his own little bit, no?
I work my land my own way.
It's not much, all that I have.
I started working it, and ....
Shit!
I've thrown everything into it.
—Miguel, what would you like to say?
—I'd like to say to our friend here that it's very good that he wants to work his own land, but how much better it would be if we all worked it together.
When the harvest is ready, are you going to eat all the wheat, and all the potatoes?
We need everything to be able to keep the revolution going.
The revolution has to be done this way.
—Don't wait for tomorrow.
—José, it's not only a question of land.
The revolution is like a pregnant cow.
If we don't help out, the cow and its calf will be gone and the children will be left hungry.
Remember that comrades, boys, died in this battle.
We must collectivise.
Do you understand me?
The people must eat.
This struggle we've started has to continue.
There are those who are the way they are, and there are those who know how to work and people who don't ....
I've got what I've got because I work.
Hold on.
Paco's turn.
It's fundamental that we improve our harvests.
We must grow more.
Other villages have done it by working all the land as one.
With a tractor you can do five times more work in one day than you can with a mule.
There's evidence from other villages that it's working.
I believe we have to take over private property.
No one's got anything ....
We could pool all our resources and depending on each person's situation we could share it out.
If you need a cow, you'll get one.
We've all got four or five kids and we've all bust a gut working, just like you.
We've got militia comrades here who may know what's happening elsewhere.
They've helped us here.
Pepe's right.
Our friends from the militia will have seen what's happened in other villages.
This is an open meeting.
You can speak, too.
Your opinions are as welcome as any of ours. please speak.
I'm from Germany.
We wanted revolution, and what happened?
We'd been the strongest movement in Europe, the best organised workers' movement.
There were six million of us in unions, and what happened?
Hitler.
The socialists and the communists told us to make our revolution later.
But I say make the revolution now.
When people see as the village sees that you can be in charge of your life, your land, when collectivisation becomes a reality, it'll be possible for people in Germany, Italy, to follow our example.
We're poor but we're alive and we've got power now, we don't have to be seized by fear.
We're alive, we'll die when our time comes, but ....
I say that we have to take risks.
What do we do?
Misery, hunger, hopelessness.
Franco might come back and kill us, but I say it's worth it to continue collectivising and improving the quality of our lives.
Let's vote.
All those in favour of collectivisation.
All those against.
Friends, the vote is to collectivise the land.
Pigat, Garibaldi, Roca.
Listen ....
Max.
Come here ....
Excuse me a moment, please.
This is probably the last time that we can vote on something as a militia.
All right?
Now watch.
Put the bullet in here.
You take off the catch, and it's ready for firing.
You need to hold the rifle harder against your shoulder.
Fire.
How's your shoulder?
You're afraid of the rifle.
Hold it firmly, like this.
You mustn't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze it like a woman's tits.
Understand?
—Have you ever squeezed a woman's tits?
—Yeah.
—I'll bet you have.
—Hold on a minute.
Come quickly.
Get a stick.
A stick!
—Is this boarding house around here?
—The pension Adela?
Hello.
Do you have a room for me?
Who are you?
My friend Blanca sent me ....
I like having English people, they are clean and tidy.
—This is my room?
—This is yours.
The attack of the telephone exchange is a declaration of war against the working class .... —What are the POUM up to?
—A general strike has been called in all industries.
except those producing weapons ....
Plants, warehouses are stopping work.
The barricades of liberty have risen again in every part of town.
You should be killing fascists, not one another!
Shut up and go home.
Get out of here, madam.
You'll get hurt.
We've got nothing to eat.
D'you hear?
We've got to put food on the table.
Sorry, friend.
I'm sorry.
Hey, you, Stalin's sidekick.
What division were you in?
The Karl Marx division.
And you?
The Third Division?
No, you bastard.
We're from the Durruti Column, the best.
You don't even know who's your enemy.
You idiots!
You have betrayed the revolution.
That's a lie.
You're the ones who have broken the anti-fascist front.
We can smell food, fascists.
—What are you cooking, bastards?
—Sausages and beans.
Are you hungry?
You bet!
Then here you are.
No more.
Never.
We're not enemies.
My friend, Martin, returned from the front dying of hunger.
It's a disaster.
—Which front?
—Aragon.
The militias are a disaster.
When it's decision time, everyone is the boss.
They say they don't even know how to load the guns.
They say the militia women aren't killing fascists, they are fucking them instead.
—They fuck them.
—They do nothing.
They're crap.
They're a disaster.
They take four totally inexperienced men,
—give them guns and stars ....
—That's a lie.
I'm from the front.
You're in the militia?
He can't even speak properly.
—What's going on?
—That's enough!
Are you mad, or what?
What do you think is going on?
If the leaders of the POUM and CNT get together, we're fucked.
That's what's happening!
They need to come from abroad to tell us that?
So what?
At least it's good that they're here.
They're bombing us ....
Listen ....
Where's the cover you promised?
What kind of position is this?
Nobody's come.
You don't understand anything ....
We can't hold on ....
We're fucked here ....
You've got to hold on.
This is madness.
Yes, sir.
Retreat immediately.
Why are you giving me this order when you've just told me to hold the position?
All right?
I also want to know ....
Listen!
Why we've been risking our lives here, waiting for the promised reinforcements.
All right?
Whatever you say, sir.
Madruga, Andrès, come here ....
And the rest, quickly.
Garibaldi, Roca, we're going back to our old positions ....
Come on, Roca.
Bernard, to the left with Jimmy.
David, cover this flank ....
Come on.
Quickly ....
Orderly, orderly, go with them.
Come on, David.
All of you get back ....
Come on, back.
—Blanca, come here ....
—Orderly, orderly, there's a bad one.
Stay with them.
Be brave.
—Gene.
—Gene, what are you doing here?
Take it easy.
Stay where you are!
—Quiet, everybody.
—What the hell's going on?
Drop your weapons on the ground, immediately.
Obey the order!
What's the meaning of this?
—Can we know why?
—Officer, get your men to obey.
—I refuse.
—Obey my orders!
From now on this unit is disbanded.
You can all go home, except for the following, who are under arrest.
Quiet!
Juan Vidal.
Bernard Goujon.
Miguel Angel Campos.
Rafael Jimènez.
What are we accused of?
The POUM is now illegal.
Your newspaper has been banned and your leaders arrested.
—What charges?
—Conspiring with the fascists.
Collaborating with Franco!
Is this conspiracy?
Is this conspiracy, Colonel?
It's a lie.
It's a lie.
Don't look at the ground, look at me face to face.
It's not a reflection on you, it's your leaders.
It's a Stalinist plot.
Siètamo.
What about SiÈtamo?
Alcubierre?
Leciñena?
Casetas de Quisena?
Tierz?
Navales?
They're all places liberated by the POUM.
—Were they fascists who did that?
—I don't have to discuss this with you.
Estrecho Quinto?
La Naja?
Les Drassanes?
Were these places liberated by fascists, too?
Quiet!
Obey my order!
Prepare to fire!
Take it easy!
—Madruga, quiet!
—You're under arrest.
Do as he says.
What happened in Barcelona with our comrades?
Murderers!
They're going to shoot you ....
Murderers!
Control your men, Captain.
Fight with us against fascism.
You bastard, come here, you coward.
Silence, you idiots.
God Almighty.
Murderers!
You bastards ....
We've fought for nothing, comrades.
—Lower your guns.
—Death to Stalinism!
Long live the revolution.
Down with fascism.
We shall leave them in the ground.
but the earth is ours now. comrades.
and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long, and our foes are many.
but we are more.
We shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
He is immortal.
Born in the Highlands of Scotland, 400 years ago.
He is not alone.
There are others like him.
Some good, some evil.
For centuries, he has battled the forces of darkness... with holy ground his only refuge.
He cannot die unless you take his head and with it, his power.
In the end, there can be only one.
He is Duncan MacLeod-- the Highlander.
Here we are
Born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe
I am immortal
I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival
No man can be my equal
Take me to the future of your world
Geez, Ceirdwyn, I thought you'd be happy for me.
Of course I'm happy for you.
I--
Steven, I love you.
Then, what's the problem?
It's in Madrid.
You got something against Spaniards?
No, of course not.
It's just--
Well, our friends are all here.
Our life is in Paris.
Our whole life could be in Madrid.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
There'll be other opportunities.
For you.
Maybe this is all I get.
Some of us don't live forever.
I think we should continue this discussion in private.
Fine.
Steven-- I'm just going to get the car.
Hey, kid.
What did you get today?
I'm not a kid.
Don't be a pain in the ass, Paolo.
Give it to him!
This is?
Tough winter.
I'll do better tomorrow.
They're be a crowd at the track.
You better.
Now get lost.
I'm sorry.
He's just a crazy kid.
But he's good, Gaston, all right?
Trust me, he's good.
Be cool, man.
Nice leather.
Get his wallet.
-Oh!
There we go.
- Ohh!
Whoo!
All right!
Give me your watch.
Now, look, you've got my wallet.
- Now, let me go.
-I said, give me your watch!
Why are you doing this?
I gave you my money.
Leave me alone!
Look, I've given you all I've got.
Come on, pretty boy, get up.
Please, take what you want.
- No.
No!
Steven!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.
The best lap time today, ladies and gentlemen, is 1:03.65.
You don't worry about him getting hurt?
I worry.
Young men.
They all think they are going to live forever.
And on the last turn--
First time trials for today.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You ride 'em like a champion.
Thanks, Maurice.
Looks like I might get in another run before dark.
I don't think Maurice's heart could take it.
My heart's as young as yours.
But I have to be at work.
Good luck, Richie.
And be careful.
Thanks, Maurice.
I'll catch you later.
Looks like you took that last bend pretty tight.
Yeah, you're telling me.
That's the second time Basil tried to run me off the track.
He's, uh, a little pissed 'cause I beat him yesterday.
How bad is it?
Oh, it's nothing.
It's healed already.
It just took a little skin off.
What?
Don't you think you're riding it a little close to the edge?
Mac, I'm riding to win like everybody else.
Do you think anybody else would break his leg in three places and still walk away?
- You think I'm cheating?
- Well, you tell me.
Would you be pushing this hard if you thought you could get hurt?
I got to get cleaned up.
Oh.
Excuse me.
What's up, man?
Wanna buy a watch?
Give me my wallet.
What wallet?
I tell you what, I'll take anyone you got with my driver's license in it.
Oh, yeah, that one.
You gonna call the cops?
Nope.
Now give me yours.
What are you talking about?
You took mine, now I want yours.
- You some kind of nut?
- Hand it over.
- There's not much in it.
- Oh, yeah, big surprise.
Okay, kid, you can go now.
And how am I supposed to get home without any money?
You're good on your feet.
Walk.
Nice wheels.
Out.
Please, mister.
I've got a real sick sister I've got to get home to.
Really?
Yeah.
It's her heart.
She needs an operation real bad.
That's why I've fallen into a life of crime.
Life of crime.
Give me a break.
They'll be other opportunities.
For you.
Maybe this is all I get.
No!
No!
Some of us don't live forever.
Is it your time, Neva?
No.
But Degal wants the wagons loaded and the families ready to move out.
Oh.
This time tomorrow the Romans will be gone.
And we will be on our way home for the birth of my son.
Oh.
And you know it will be a son?
And his name will be Callum.
Callum, Son of Callum.
I think Callum is a fine name.
Fight well.
I always do.
For a man.
Watch your back.
Why?
When I have you.
No!
No!
You-- Hey!
No.
You're not the right one.
I can be anyone you want me to be.
You don't want to be who I'm looking for.
It's about three blocks away.
You live around here?
Me and my brother.
No parents?
What, you writing a book?
Me and Mario make out okay.
Why are you stopping?
Stay here.
Don't touch anything.
- Do you know him?
- Never-
- Never seen him before.
Who is he Paolo?
Paolo?
Paolo!
Ceirdwyn?
It's good to see you again, Duncan.
It's not your part of town.
You out walking or hunting?
Hunting.
And you?
The same.
I'm looking for a killer.
So am I.
There's a dead man in the warehouse back there killed by a sword.
So?
Tell me it wasn't you.
Do us both a favor, MacLeod, don't ask me any more questions.
Since when did a warrior become a murderer?
Is that what you call it when a killer is killed?
I call it justice and so did you once.
There's no war today, Ceirdwyn.
Isn't there?
They killed my husband.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Well, don't be sorry.
Just stay out of my way.
My Lord, can't we not rest tonight?
We could reach the boat at dawn.
The boat to take me off, to lick my wounds like a whipped hound?
I've suffered the worst defeat in Scottish history.
And now the English murderers will say,
"Aye.
Bonnie Prince Charlie ran away with this tail 'tween his legs."
Let them say what they will.
By God, we fought as bravely as men can.
For the sake of the men, sire,
I know a tavern nearby.
Good.
Let the English know we stopped for a port of ale fore leaving.
This way!
Duncan.
Duncan MacLeod.
Hey!
Ceirdwyn.
It's Flora.
Flora McDonald now.
And you can put me down.
Mm.
We need food and a place to spend the night.
Well, this is a sorry lot you're traveling with.
By the look of them, they've not two pennies to rub together.
Hold your tongue.
Why?
Who does he think he is-- Bonnie Prince Charlie himself?
Forgive me.
I had no idea.
No matter, lass.
You're right.
Cumberland is on our heels.
And I'll no put a woman in danger.
We ride on.
No, sire.
Whatever I have is yours.
And if there's a cause worth dying for, it's this one.
A trampled people must stand while they can.
Stay.
I thank ya, lass.
Well, MacLeod, see if you can't find a penny or two to rub together, huh?
How was I to know?
Oh, I do not like it.
Is this really necessary?
Aye, my Lord.
If the English are watching the coast, it may be your only chance to get through.
Aye.
The "Pretender" I am called.
Now I'm pretending I'm a woman.
This is no way for a prince to travel.
A prince, my Lord, may be caught.
They'll not be looking for a woman.
Well, 'tis done.
Best I can.
So, what do you think, MacLeod?
Why, it's most becoming, sire.
You're a little tall, but it suits you.
That is, you look good enough to fool the English.
Aye.
Aye, what ever happened to dignity?
Dignity dies with the House of Stuart.
You cannot lose it whatever the dress.
Lass, I thank you.
You may well have saved Scotland.
Gentlemen, afore the tide turns.
Sire, if you please.
I must stay.
The English are butchering farmers who've never seen a battlefield.
I have unfinished business here.
So do we all, MacLeod, but one sword won't turn the war.
No, but I'll make them pay dearly.
All right.
I believe you will.
Angus, the first man of us can have the back of your hand.
Any slacker will get more than the back of my hand, sire.
Stay with me, MacLeod.
Ah, this land is filled with Scottish graves.
Aye.
And they're be English ones by the time I'm through.
Has there not been enough bloodshed?
Enough?
They slaughtered 4,000 Scots.
Men, women, children in their mother's arms.
I do not ask you to understand.
Aye, but I do, only too well.
More blood does not make it better.
It never will.
So what are you gonna do?
I don't now.
Mac, if the only way to stop her is to fight her--
Could I kill her?
I'm gonna see if Paolo is working the crowds.
Mac, are you looking for a way to stop her or a reason not to?
Either one works for me.
You be careful.
Sure.
No hard feelings, Richie.
Oh, why?
'Cause you lied to me then tried to run me off the track?
It was an honest mistake.
Go away, Basil.
Save it for the next rookie.
Be careful on the track.
Anything can happen.
We gotta stop meeting like this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't kill me.
I didn't do it.
Hey, I'm not going to hurt you.
I was there, but it wasn't me.
What are you talking about?
I saw you with the dead woman.
Paolo, what did you see?
Sh-She came back.
It's all right.
It's okay.
It's okay.
And she killed the guy in the warehouse.
Gaston.
Who else?
Who else was there the night her husband was killed?
I don't know.
Paolo, I'm gonna stop her.
You can't.
Nothing can stop her.
I can.
Gaston kept shooting at her, and she kept coming back.
She's gonna kill them all, isn't she?
Where are the others, Paolo?
I don't know.
He's not safe on the streets.
Who?
Your brother.
He's one of them, isn't he?
I just want to talk to him.
It wasn't his fault.
Gaston had the gun.
Mario was just--
Was just going along?
A man's dead, Paolo.
For what?
A few francs and the keys to a car?
It wasn't his fault!
Yeah, maybe not.
But if she finds him first, then he's dead.
You can drop me here.
Look, if you decide you want to talk, come see me.
You really think you can stop her?
I'm gonna try.
They hang out at the Black Door.
Don't tell him I told you.
I won't.
I promise.
Ceirdwyn, wait.
Stay out of this, MacLeod.
The shooter's already dead.
How many more?
There were five.
This isn't the answer.
A head for a head and a body for a body since the dawn of time.
It's no different now.
Revenge does nothing, Ceirdwyn, nothing.
You know that.
When we're finished, they're be nothing left in this stinking land... but ice and sheep, eh?
What the devil?
As far as you're concerned, the devil himself.
Hyah!
What the-- They're getting cleaned and mended, MacLeod.
They were full of blood.
Well, it looks like you made the English pay.
But I don't think they were the only ones.
We're warriors, MacLeod.
We avenge our own.
We kill the killers.
But there's a time to stop, when enough is enough, you know that.
Maybe it's too late.
The things I've done.
I've killed so many-- young, old-- with their wives and children watching.
I've become the thing I hate.
You've seen too much death.
What you need is a taste of life.
It's different being with a mortal, isn't it?
I didn't-
- I didn't think it would work.
But Steven was so sure.
He said if we loved each other enough, then nothing else mattered.
We were together 15 years, almost 16.
Seems like yesterday when we met.
He was just out of school.
He's a boy.
Really just full of hopes and dreams.
They change so much so fast, don't they?
I watched him grow into the man he was... into the man I loved.
And then to lose him like-- like that.
Mm, well, what about you, MacLeod?
You ever loved anyone enough, trusted anyone enough?
Once.
She was killed over a few dollars in a car.
Aye, you think you'll ever love again?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And her name is?
Anne.
Anne Lindsey.
Does she know about you, about what you are?
Why not?
Because they die.
Steven didn't die.
He was murdered, and it was too soon.
Yeah, but you can't trade death for death, Ceirdwyn.
Avenging his death is his memorial.
You've already killed the guy that pulled the trigger.
Let the rest go.
Let that be his memorial.
I just mi-- I miss him so much.
I know.
I did what I had to do.
But you'd think after all this time I would have learned.
Death is always death.
And when someone's gone, nothing can bring them back.
Not pain, not rage... not revenge.
Good-bye, my love.
Let's see those things.
What are you doing, man?
Excellent.
We're not really going after her?
Do you want to wait around for her to pick us off one by one?
No thanks.
I checked out the address.
It's a house on the Left Bank.
I say we go tonight.
And, remember, she must wear some kind of vest, so aim for the head.
Yeah, right.
I know where to aim.
You just make sure you do.
You can't do this.
We gotta get her before she gets us.
She'll kill you.
Yeah?
Mario, don't.
Come on, go home.
As they come into the hairpin corner, a very tight grouping of the over-1000cc class bikes here today.
The competition is tough out there today.
Go!
Go!
Bring it in!
Yellow caution flag on the course.
Yellow flag on the course.
Please stay off the course, ladies and gentlemen.
Please stay off the course.
It's always sad to lose one so young.
So much he had yet to do.
My first wife was a religious woman.
To her, those who had died were never far away.
I hope it's true.
Truer than you think.
I'm sorry.
I--
I think I need to be alone for a while, Maurice.
Of course.
I understand.
I see you got out of the morgue okay.
Yeah.
It wasn't easy getting across town without any clothes, but I suppose this is supposed to be some kind of lesson, right?
One of them.
Basil's dead, isn't he?
He died on the way to the hospital.
I keep running the race in my head, Mac.
I see him right there.
I was so pissed off I wanted to run right over him.
Maybe that's what I did.
But I did not consciously try to kill him, Mac.
I don't think that matters to Basil right now.
- So what does this mean?
- It means you're dead in France.
It means you're dead in Europe for almost a generation.
It means you're gonna have to disappear.
It means you're gonna have to live with this for the rest of your life.
Mac, did you ever... screw up like this?
Sometimes.
Will you put some clothes on?
What happened?
Why don't you be a good boy and get out of here?
I don't think so.
Well, I asked you politely.
Now you have a choice.
You either leave or die.
Go ahead, do it.
-,Ceirdwyn?
- Do it.
- Ceirdwyn?
- No.
No.
Please?
Ceirdwyn, don't do this.
Leave him to the police.
Get around the back.
Get up!
You gonna be okay?
No.
Not for a long time.
I'm not gonna forget him, Mac, you know?
But it was worth it.
For the 15 years we had together, I'll trade 15 years of pain.
I'd trade a hundred.
Well, what about the price they pay?
No family, living in secrecy, waiting for the night you go out and you never come back.
Maybe we're not supposed to be with them.
They're not children, MacLeod.
They make their own decisions.
Steven knew what I was, and he chose to be with me.
Are you sure Anne wouldn't do the same thing?
If you love her, Duncan, don't make that choice for her.
Joe.
Hi.
Thanks for coming down.
Yeah.
Well, uh, you, uh, you said it was important.
You kinda sounded a bit nervous.
Yeah.
Maybe.
So, uh, how you been holding up?
Oh, uh, working hard, you know.
Keeping busy.
Trying, uh, not to think about it too much.
Yeah.
Sure.
Sit down, please.
Sit down.
- Why don't I get you a drink?
- Oh, no, thanks.
Trust me.
You want a drink.
Well, now you're making me nervous.
You know, I've, uh,
I've always thought you were, uh, quite a remarkable woman.
You know something, Joe?
You can, uh, skip the sweet talk.
Now you said it was important, so I'm-
- I'm here.
Yeah.
Look... you know how there were always things, uh, about MacLeod he couldn't tell you?
Things he didn't get to explain before he died?
Yes.
So?
It's time for the explanation.
He, uh, wanted me to give you this.
- What is it?
- It's a plane ticket to Paris.
I'm-I'm going to Paris?
- I guess that depends.
- Depends on what?
It's for you.
H-Hello?
Duncan?
Duncan?
And here we are
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong fighting for survival
We've come to be the rulers of your world
I am immortal
I have inside me blood of kings Yeah!
I have no rival
No man can be my equal
Take me to the future of your world
Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc.
Los Angeles
... It's been six years since I work Thomas Veil ...
He's a genius!
... Tom Veil?
I was always fascinated by his photos This one is particularly appalling His work is very bare, very austere ...
They are glaring truth, Thomas.
They are cruel ...
That reality is cruel.
Do not blame the messenger!
- The photographer?
- Yes, the photographer.
They are wonderful Mr. Veil.
You managed to capture extraordinary scenes ...
Beautiful?
Actually, I do not see it that way.
- And how do you see?
- As ... testimony.
Sorry.
- A spring roll?
- No, thank you.
- Cheese Biscuit?
- No, thank you.
Honey?
Excuse me!
The baby-sitter comes to call, and ...
Tommy the little vomit after dinner.
I'm sorry.
Try the sushi, it is delicious!
Sorry ...
- The baby-sitter?
- It's the first thing that came to me.
- The "little Tommy"?
- Yes, I am a photographer, not a writer!
It sounds good "The little Tommy Veil." It was not the title of an 45s?
One day we will have children and the good God will punish that thou mocked.
- What is happening?
- The great Tommy will vomit.
We're going?
No!
You do not want to anyway deprive people of your job?
They see my job.
They need not see me!
I see.
The photographer must all show But he must remain in the shadows.
- I invite you to eat a steak.
Ok?
- Later!
Potatoes ...
A sweet and sour sauce ...
Chives ...
Tom, you have to stay.
This expo is the chance of your life.
... And the cheesecake for dessert.
- In 15 minutes.
- I knew you'd crack!
That's the problem with marriage:
There's no more mystery!
Believe me ...
For me, you will always be a mystery!
Hey Tom!
Come here!
If people continue to make you lather you will take a big head!
- Well what?
It makes you not like?
- I'm out of here as soon as I can!
Are you kidding?
You have the fame and fortune at hand, buddy!
- Me it would drive me crazy!
- Well, it makes me mad, is you.
Adore it!
Hey ...
With friends, we're going to box.
We join you?
- I'm too old to go dancing, Larry!
- No you're just too married.
Singles dance, them!
That's right, or inflatable dolls!
On the other hand, it also has chicks here ...
I tell them just that I'm your best friend!
And the compliments I cash in your place.
Want to see me at work?
Oh!
Mr Veil!
What a wonderful and powerful show!
Your pictures are fascinating, oppressive, deliciously icy.
Should not promise such a thing!
Thank you.
You saw great!
You know ...
You could just buy the cheesecake!
- So easily?
- Yes.
That's why you married me, right?
- It's beautiful anyway.
- Yeah.
Cheers!
It's gonna be fireworks tonight!
You sound like a real praying mantis!
- You know what I was thinking?
- To satisfy all my fantasies?
No, not that ...
I thought it a pity your mother is not coming to the opening.
It would have been proud of you.
Even at my funeral it would not come.
Or rather ...
She would not miss it!
- You could call her.
- And you think she would have spoken?
- You should have a try.
- But I tried!
You know ...
There were enough guests.
And then she I would have even accused of ...
Pushed my father to leave home, and giving up like a dog!
Your father was unhappy in that farm.
And we must say that it is not a gift of living with your mother!
Even take a cup of coffee with her, is not a gift.
She said the day I left for my dream, I gave up.
I left my father and to influence two months later, she was alone.
Your work has come to be recognized.
It's sad that she does not know.
I will send him a photograph.
I come back.
Ca va?
Yes, that's fine.
What do I do?
Hey, Gino!
- Alison has changed table?
- Pardon?
Alison, my wife.
Legs dream ...
Nice smile ...
Small tip ...
- It is more to our table.
- Sorry, I do not know who you mean.
Are you kidding?
We were sitting there between these two lights ...
Now there are two others.
Mr. and Mrs. Cherney reserve this table every Thursday and has been for 10 years.
Oh, okay ...
I see ...
Alison makes me a joke, right?
It's funny ...
I have a good laugh ...
Now, where is it?
- Learn then to the reception.
- No Gino ...
Gino!
We stop playing.
Where is it?
I am compelled to ask you leaving the restaurant, sir.
Are you serious?
You do not remember that sat at the table, there is 15 minutes?
- Sir, please ...
- It's getting ridiculous.
We'll explain.
You are convincing in the role torque of the third age, but ...
Is folded his napkin, and we're going.
The joke is over.
Leave my wife alone!
I'll leave your wife alone when you would have made me mine.
- If we would talk about this outside?
- How far you will go, Gino?
- What?
You want to beat me up?
- I said we would discuss outside.
You will pay the bill!
Good, good ...
- Do not worry too much?
- No, because you breathe again.
And what do I do now?
I return at the show, and I apologize for being gone?
You can leap into the river, I do not care but most go near the restaurant!
And besides, she took the car!
Ca, you'll pay me!
Sorry, the number you ask ... 5 ... 5 ... 5 ... 6 ... 4 ... 3 ... 8.
Sorry, the number you ask is not in use, check the directory.
$ 7.25, please.
- Voila ...
Keep the change.
- Thanks.
Alison!
That's me!
Go ...
Open that door!
Go Alison!
Open that door!
Who are you?
What do you want?
This is not funny.
I count to ten and if you stay there, I call the police.
What are you doing?
Go ...
The joke is over.
I'm cold and I'm tired.
Let me go!
You too, you're in the game?
Well, you can tell me ...
Alison, all right?
Hey ...
If you were going to sleep off your wine elsewhere, you?
You are who you are?
I am her husband, and I am also the who has the finger on the trigger.
The debate is closed, so ...
Either you identify, either you take a shot in the leg.
Larry!
Larry!

It has to do with the picture, right?
You do not access my bank account and only changed the locks on the doors.
So who are they, Alison?
Okay ...
They threatened to kill you if I told you about.
Who?
Who are they?
- I do not know ...
Men.
- Yes, but who?
- Policies?
The military?
- I know!
All I know is that I had no choice.
They are watching me.
They will also monitor.
It is not I who am your enemy.
Excuse me darling.
Excuse me.
Thinking.
We must be able to tell someone.
What do you want me to do?
Stop the car.
I doubt they have also pressure on the cops.
- What is the problem?
- You can exit the car, sir?
- Put yourself on the front, hands on the hood.
- Okay, okay ...
We received a call reporting the presence of a man on your back seat.
- It was thought that there was a problem.
- There is no problem.
I am her husband ...
All is well, Madame?
Mr. Officer, help me.
This man was stashed in the back.
- I've never seen.
This is a patient.
- What are you talking about?
Do not go near me anymore.
Is that understood?
Do not talk to me!
Do not come home anymore!
- But you said ...
- What did you want me to say?
You're sick, you should seek treatment!
It mens.
I do not know why but someone forced him to do that.
- You must believe me.
My wife!
- You have the right to refuse to talk
Anything you say can ...
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL Calaway
I know it sounds crazy, but I do not invent history.
I'm not paranoid.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- No!
Do you mind if I go?
"Do you mind if I go? " Very funny, I love it ...
Some of my colleagues would say that humor is a defense reaction.
- But do not you?
- No.
I enjoy the repartee, and I refuse to see everything in a theoretical manner.
- This is normally prohibited.
- I really have to wear that?
We'll get.
You understand why you're here?
I know the circumstances where it led me here.
This is the"why"I'm not sure I understand.
According to police, you have harassed a woman.
A woman?
It's not what happened!
There is one essential thing you need to learn here.
To make a good impression, you have to control his moods.
We want our patients to be always even-tempered, ok?
Ok
According to the report, you went to this woman is a scandal.
Listen ...
If you let me speak ...
Apparently, you are entered its car and you've landed on a parking lot.
It's my turn?
Your turn.
You know my name?
You told the police Thomas Veil you were.
This name means nothing to you?
You know my work?
- No, should I?
- I'm a photographer.
- Some of my work has been published.
- You are so famous?
Do not talk like that!
I tell you the truth!
Your truth!
I know it all looks crazy.
Would be difficult, too, to swallow such a story.
Doctor, the woman who is accused is to have harassed my wife!
Someone, I do not know for what reason, the force to act as if she knew me not.
Otherwise, you're not paranoid!
Call my friends!
Check!
That's what I intend to do.
And your family?
You have a family ...
Why you do not call my friend Larry Levy?
16550 Hamilton Street.
No need to note, it is in the directory!
I can give you three pages of names, if it helps you.
All right.
And your parents?
- I have my mother.
But ...
- But?
Do you mind being called?
It should Contact either your wife or your mother!
No!
You can name it!
Dr. Jonathan Veil.
18 Front Edge Road 6.
Council Bluth.
Iowa.
Hey!
You thought you know everything, huh?
What?
You thought you were a guy who it is not, eh?
- What do you want?
- We begin to lose faith ...
- Who are you?
- Your roommate.
I'm Eddie, the "schizophrenic Paranoid "in the next room.
How do you feel?
- What are you doing here?
- You sound like the doctor!
No answer, but a slew of questions ...
They have finally have you, eh?
What do you know?
There he goes again!
You will not take them at their own game
It's not even worth trying, man!
You told them you were a photographer?
Good!
"The all-seeing eye imperturbable" which I do not know what ...
What do you know?
It is because of the photo execution, is not it?
These are the men I've photographed?
Why are you asking me?
I'm mentally ill!
- Maybe they're not like your kind.
- Ie?
Approach to gender in the work combines the kind to look behind the curtain.
You simply watch the magic trick, not seek to know how it works.
Then, take acting classes better lie!
I spoke to Dr. Bellamy.
He called my friends ...
Ah, I see ...
You trust to medicine.
It's your choice.
- Listen to me!
When will my friends ...
- It is you who'd better listen!
You've no idea what that scam.
You do not have a single friend.
What they gave you, they will resume!
Everything you had, you did more!
This is the total nothingness, my poor!
You mean Bellamy is one of them?
You know what?
The next time you see him,
Ask him for news of David Powers.
Yeah.
You do not think it's risky take me there without tie me?
Living dangerously adds spice to a life so ordinary.
I'm sure I will survive!
What you fear then?
Your confrontation with the real world ...
But it will be useful and it will do you good.
So what I said is quite plausible to you?
You never know ...
How do you enter?
I said they had changed the locks.
This is where you see my experience:
I called before!
- Hi!
- Hello.
- Who are you?
- Pay no attention to him.
It is like this since its fall baseball!
Listen ...
If you want to be listening, you behave properly.
This woman does not work here.
I've never seen in my life.
- She looked pretty surprised, too.
- But it's my studio!
It is not open to the public.
It is not enough to call before!
That's why we're here:
To compare your version with reality.
It is not reality!
They organized the whole stage!
This is exactly the kind of speech we advise you to avoid ...
Mmm ...
It's very hard.
They are all of you?
Yes, I have this one in Guatemala on 2 December ...
The Tiananmen Square ...
Bosnia ...
El Salvador ...
Seoul, Korea South ...
They are all from me!
- And you think one is missing?
- Yes.
It was on this side ...
Here.
It should be easy to check.
This photo was a run, right?
Excuse me Madame ...
Would it be possible to have an interview with the photographer?
We would like to compliment for his work.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately he is traveling abroad.
- But what are you talking about?
- Thank you!
Thank you!
- So ...
You believe it, and not me?
- Put yourself in my place.
They came, but the person who works here does not know you.
- I know ...
- What do you expect?
I spent half my life here.
I know ...
I know where everything is stored.
This is where I put my chemicals.
Coffee!
My papers!
Someone came here and all moved!
It does not behave like that in a public place.
Here's my studio!
It was I who built partly.
Someone moved all my stuff and paid the woman to sit there.
And someone pushed your wife.
Negatives ...
They could not find them.
They know where I put them.
- You hide your negatives?
- Sometimes it is healthy to be paranoid!
Yes.
Yes, I know ...
Not ...
Not ...
Later.
Tonight ...
At ten in the hospital.
So sorry ...
Where were we?
Ah!
Negatives ...
Yes.
No!
They had to find them.
And you are sure they were there?
They should have been here.
- What do you have?
- From the confusion.
- And you lose confidence in you?
- Yes.
I know more ...
Do not fight.
Confusion is not necessarily a bad thing.
In this case,
The question that you feel can pave the road to recovery.
Let's go.
You're fishing now JC!
There's so much fishing, so little time.
Leads you again!
I try to tell them my name, but they do not believe me.
But you, you, you believe me.
Right, Eddie?
Otherwise how you could win 3 parts of 5?
Why nobody wants to hear the truth?
That confusion, Eddie.
Oh, you know, JC ...
Confusion is not necessarily a bad thing.
In this case,
The question that you feel can pave the road to recovery.
Game, set and match!
We can not compete with divine forces!
Hey!
You thought you had seen it all, my little man?
Imagine what it's being to have a father like hers?
Eddie!
What's going on?
How do you know so many things?
Not attempt to enter my head.
You've got enough problems of your own ...
Tell me only what you know.
Have you talked to Dr. David Powers?
No.
No, I have not had the opportunity.
So you do not have all the clues ...
But what evidence?
With that the doctor does go tonight at 10 o'clock?
It's time for your medication ...
It is to knock you ...
You'll like it here.
You're aware that this is the curfew?
Listen to me ...
Listen to me ...
The Doctor is in on it!
This is an accomplice ...
Ask him what he does with my wife!
Listen to me, please ...
A hen on the wall ... who ... and tingling of the hard bread ...
It was a small man, Tom ...
Hey ...
Eddie!
Tom, you were very quiet.
And then they brought.
And they took his name.
Now everything is ruined.
Log ...
Peck ...
Log Peck.
Marie made her ...
Pre-frontal Lobotomy
No bigger than a grain.
That its grain.
No!
No!
Thank you.
It seems that because of nightlife?
Shut up!
Shut up!
I do not know what he was there, but I put six times the ...
You use usual for us to sleep.
- What do you want?
- That you make me my life, junk!
- I can not.
- So it's me who'll take yours.
These are my instructions:
We will down and exit through the front door.
And you will like it you with me.
Ok?
If you make the slightest gesture, the slightest movement ...
- Ok ...
I understand
- Good.
Close the door!
Voila.
And now?
The key ...
- You'll get in that way.
- Maybe not ...
- How long ...
- A few hours.
I have not emptied the syringe.
So you have committed a huge mistake.
You do not still you'll get by like that?
I will go out very well.
I practice what I learned in recent days.
If the identity of an individual is fragile, if I can not be Tom Veil
So I will ...
You!
The code of your credit card?
We have nowhere to go.
They will find you.
They?
And who are they, Doctor?
Or is it just delusions a paranoid?
You have no idea of ?
what what you attack.
- Tell me.
- Thanks.
But if you must kill me, I prefer this to be by you.
And my wife ...
How did you put pressure on her?
This is your big problem:
You do not seem to understand ...
That people always end by cooperating.
Probably by dint of threats, pressure.
You'd be surprised ...
Really?
How far can they go, Doctor?
As I gave their names, I guess they will go to Larry and my mother.
Your negatives ...
This is your big problem, doctor:
You do not seem to realize ...
That whatever you do, everyone still has secrets ...
Him and only in him.
Everyone has secrets you'll never fly.
What happened to David Powers?
- It failed.
- And who won?
I found my chemicals.
Bromide suffers ...
Very useful in a dark room.
And also very flammable.
- But what are you doing that?
- The truth!
Who do you work?
Kill him!
Larry Levy Associates.
Good morning.
Larry Levy, please.
- Secretary Larry Levy.
- Hi Suzie!
Larry is there?
- Who Ie application?
- It's Tom ...
Veil.
I'm sorry Mr Veil.
It is not there.
Can I take a message?
- Where is it in the middle of the day?
- I can take a message for him ...
Yes, yes, I know.
Leave open, leave.
Thank you.
I arrive ...
You're presentable?
So why are not you at work?
Larry, it's me.
We need to talk.
Lovely!
You look like a fool escaped from the asylum!
I'll find clothes.
- I am referring to Mrs Jonathan Veil.
- From whom?
- Who are you?
- Who is calling?
Ladies and gentlemen, we begin the descent to the airport in Des Moines.
It is 9:52 local time, and it's 17 degrees.
Can I help you?
I do not know.
It depends ...
Who are you?
- I am a nurse of Helen.
And you?
- The nurse?
I am his son.
What was she needed you?
You are his son?
Not sure?
Your mother had a stroke six days there.
Excuse me.
Hey, Mom!
Mom!
That's me!
It's Tom!
Do you hear me?
She is half-conscious.
Some days I feel better than others ...
How did it go?
She is 73 years old!
Who hired you?
Who pays you?
If you have any questions, talk to my boss.
I will, you can be sure.
Sue?
I come back.
Mom!
It's me, Tom!
You hear me?
- Is that you?
- Yes, Mom.
I'm here.
All is well, it's good ...
Excuse me, sir.
You have an ID?
You also want a birth certificate?
A driver's license will do.
I left it in my hotel room.
- The car is an outside location?
- Yes.
- And you are driving without a license?
- I forgot in my room!
If you could go with me we'll get this straight.
Get out!
Sir, we can do that smooth, or the hard way.
I told you to leave!
Let's go.
Keep it Matt, it is not necessary.
Keep it.
Hello, I am the father Ralph Thomas Saint Anne.
Sue just told me Helen is your mother?
You are St. Anne?
Where is Father Carney?
I'm sorry but He died there about 6 weeks.
He was a man of heart, but his was not very strong!
I'm surprised that Helen did me never said she had a son.
Six weeks it's just to know it?
Yes I do.
We had many conversations.
She never mentioned you.
Tom?
Yes mom, it's me.
I'm here.
Helen?
This is Ralph Thomas.
Hello, my father.
Helen, the young man claims be your son.
Is that correct?
Tom ...
My son ...
I'm surprised because you have never spoken to me.
My son is dead!
I have no son!
Do not approach!
Put that gun, my son.
Nobody will want to harm.
That's what you said Carney's father before killing him.
- He had a heart attack!
- Yes ...
And you took his place.
You are upset, you do not know what you say.
Give me that gun!
Needless to serve me your usual sermon priest.
It does not!
Oh, my God!
Are you sick?
You are all in on it?
You put pressure on my mother,
On Father Carney, the police ...
What do you do?
What?
See all the people I met?
Everyone I talked to?
Up!
- Do what it says!
- Come here!
Come on!
This way!
Voila ...
- At least gesture, she dies!
- Please, my son.
In any case, I have much to lose.
You can tell your friends they can not have it all.
They will threaten all the beautiful people I spoke ...
Me, they get me!
It blows!
Yes, it's true!
You seem to wait a car stops.
- Where do I drive?
- Where do you go?
- By this ...
- Well, that's where I'm going too!
I go to Donkey.
Donkey, it sounds good.
Do you mind if I smoke?
I mean ...
After all, my car!
I have not got all day, sir!
You're in luck.
They are rare cars in the corner.
Okay ...
As you wish ...
Eh, my good Scout?
I know one will find the endless day!
have you seen her yet?
yeah!
Yeah!
Seen who?
you haven't seen the foreign girl yet?
Foreign girl?
Class A.
She just transferred here last week.
She's hot!
did you know that?
13)}Great Deal 30 yen per picture Asuka Langley Sohryu Photo Order Sheet
She's seriously cute. do you think she matured early?
Don't be stupid!
and she's here in a foreign land with a heart that can't be mended.
45)}To Miss Sohryu man...
Everybody and their brother!
Asuka!
Asuka!
They're just ignorant.
come again.
At least the pictures don't reveal her personality.
Hello!
Shinji!
Guten Morgen!
Guten morgen... why so gloomy this early?
This is the gorgeous Asuka greeting you!
Look a little more happy about it!
isn't she?
Who's that?
of course!
if it's Ayanami...
Hello!
the pilot of the prototype.
I'm Asuka!
Asuka Langley Sohryu.
I'm the pilot of Eva Unit 02.
Let's be good friends!
Why?
in lots of ways.
I will.
Talk about odd.
I'll say.
Are only weirdos chosen to be pilots?
Have you lost some weight?
Have I?
You must be enduring an unrequited love.
How did you know?
Because...
A woman with a mole in the pathway of her tears is destined to a life full of them.
I'm afraid you can't.
There's a very scary lady watching us.
Kaji.
It's been a while.
Kaji?
He's as much of an idiot as ever.
hurry up and leave!
I just received orders this morning that I'll be staying here on loan.
just like we used to.
Who'd hang out with YOU?
Enemy attack?
!
We just got this report from the patrolling battlecruiser Haruna.
Huge submerged object detected off Ki'i peninsula.
Sending data.
The data has been collated.
Wavelength pattern Blue.
Confirmed to be an Angel.
Level One.
Episode 9 Moment and Heart Together
The recent battle severely damaged the intercept system of New Tokyo-3.
We've only effected 26 percent of the repairs at present.
And our operational capability for actual combat is virtually nil.
we'll crush the target in a single blow right before it makes landfall!
Units 01 and 02 will mount an attack in a series of waves.
close in and take turns.
Roger.
This sucks.
It's my Japanese debut.
Why won't she let me take it out myself?
It can't be helped.
That's the strategy.
just don't get in my way!
Why did someone like him get chosen to be a pilot?
Two against one isn't a fair fight.
I don't like it.
Not my style.
We don't have the luxury of choosing our means to survive.
Here it comes!
Commence attack!
I'll go first!
Back me up!
Back you up?
Ladies first!
don't order me around!
You're the new one!
I can take him!
Amazing!
Third Child?
!
A fight should be elegant and without waste.
That's cheating! which split from the target submerged 2 km off Suruga Bay.
Unit 02 was halted by Target B.
We have a comment from the chair of Project E.
This is pathetic.
This is all your fault!
You totally screwed up my debut battle!
What are you talking about?
You're the one who did something stupid!
Stupid?
!
Where does a lamebrain like you get off calling me that?
That's just shameless!
What do you mean?
!
We got in this trouble because you were in such a rush to defeat it!
What was that?
You look like a drowned rat!
How lame!
NERV abandoned the operation
Like you can talk!
And transferred command to the UN Secondary Force.
You've humiliated us.
the UN forces made an attack with an N2 mine.
We'll have to re-draw the map again.
85)}7th Angel A/B
They succeeded in burning off 28% of the target's structural substance.
87)}7th Angel B 153)}7th Angel A
Nerv Scientific Investigation Branch
Did they kill it?
This is merely temporary relief.
A second attack is a matter of time.
so we got something out of it.
you two.
Do you know what your job is?
Piloting Eva.
No!
Your job is to defeat the Angels.
Nerv does not exist to make grotesque displays like this.
you two must cooperate.
Why should we?
!
Enough already.
Why's everyone so touchy here?
It's because adults don't like to be embarrassed.
Where's Miss Misato?
Cleaning things up.
The person in charge exists to take responsibility. and here you have complaints from the PR department as well.
Make sure you read them all.
I don't have to read them to know what they say.
right?
How insightful.
I don't need them to tell me.
I'll do it here as soon as the topside gets cleaned up.
I'll destroy the Angels without fail.
The Vice Commander is livid.
You'll almost certainly be demoted if you embarrass him again.
It was a silver lining that Commander Ikari wasn't here.
you'd have been fired before he ever saw these.
right?
Just one.
Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.
It's good to have kind friends from way back.
I'm not the one who will be bailing out my old friend.
283)}To my honey
This is Kaji's idea.
Kaji's?
but...
What is this?
!
Don't be so rude!
Those are my personal belongings!
What are you doing here?
!
why are you still here?
Still here?
You've been dumped for the new model!
Misato will be living with me.
it's the logical choice when you consider whose abilities are superior.
I'd rather live with Mr. Kaji.
But why are Japanese rooms so small anyway?
Not even half of my stuff fits!
323)}Shin's Ro why don't the Japanese have any sense of privacy?
How can they live in rooms without locks?
Unbelievable!
It's because the Japanese way is to consider the priorities and needs of others before one's own.
Miss Misato!
Welcome home!
Looks like you're getting along well already.
What do you mean?
This is all preparation for the next operation.
How's that?
The seventh Angel has one and only one weakness!
A simultaneous two-point attack on each target's core while its components are separated.
an attack by two Evas with perfectly synchronized timing.
we'll need cooperation and perfect coordination from you two.
I'm having you two live together.
No way!
It's always been said that boys and girls shouldn't sleep together after age seven!
The Angel is currently restoring itself.
so there's no time.
But that's crazy!
So here's how to make the crazy possible. you'll memorize the attack pattern that's been arranged to this music.
as soon as possible.
But I wonder what's happened to Shinji.
right?
there's the class rep.
Two of the three stooges.
Why are you here?
To see how Miss Sohryu is doing.
What about you two?
To see how Ikari's doing.
Why did you stop here?
Yes?
Traitor!
in this day and age?
!
I can't believe this!
so she made us... you two!
You're wrong!
You're wrong!
Two wrongs don't make a right!
welcome everybody!
Could ya please explain what all this's about?
You shoulda told us that to begin with.
So how is the coordination coming?
as you can see...
Are you surprised?
!
There's no way I could possibly lower myself to Shinji's level!
It's just an utterly impossible idea!
Then you give up?
do you?
Rei?
Ma'am.
Why don't you try?
Ma'am.
It looks like I should alter the operation to pair Shinji and Rei.
No!
I can't stand this!
I've had enough!
Asuka!
Even the Devil cries sometimes.
Ikari!
Go after her!
You made a girl cry!
Take responsibility!
Well...
Don't say anything.
I know.
I have no choice but to pilot the Eva.
I'll do it.
I'll show up both Rei and Misato!
You don't have to show them up or anything.
aren't you?
!
For their attack... on my pride...
I'll pay them back ten times over!
Two More Days
Attack Tomorrow
Where's Misato?
At work.
She called earlier.
She'll be there all night.
So that means we're all alone tonight.
This is the impenetrable Wall of Jericho.
Take one step over this wall and you're a dead man.
it's time for children to go to bed!
How can the Japanese sleep on the floor?
I can't believe it.
Mama...
Mama...
You're just a child yourself.
somebody will see us.
Who's watching?
Someb...
Honestly!
There's nothing between us anymore.
Don't do that again.
But your lips didn't say no.
Your lips or your words...
Which one should I trust?
There you go.
Thanks.
You're unusually sober today.
a little.
Work?
Or a man?
A lot of things.
Still in love?
Don't say weird stuff like that!
Who'd want that jerk?
! but I can't believe I was dating a jerk like him.
It's the biggest blemish on my life.
I meant that he may still like you.
Did I scare you?
Why you lousy...
Getting angry only shows I hit a sore spot.
Why not be more honest with your feelings this time?
Things are different than eight years ago.
It hasn't changed.
Not a bit.
Still too immature.
I've got to get to work.
Tomorrow is the big day.
Target has broken through the final defense line at Gora.
Here it comes!
We won't fail this time!
Deploy your AT fields as soon as the music starts.
Then stick to the operation.
you two?
Roger!
The target has entered the mountains.
got it?
I know that.
We'll finish in sixty-two seconds.
Target entering Ground Zero.
Detach external power cables.
Launch.
370)}Time remaining
Both Evas confirmed operational.
Geez...
This is pathetic.
You jerk!
How dare you do that to my Unit 02?
!
What are you talking about?
You're the one who fell on me!
You're the one who lost his timing first!
It's because you're always so out of it!
staying up so late last night?
!
Image training for today's battle!
Liar!
I know you tried to kiss me while I was sleeping!
No fair!
You were awake?
!
but it was real?
!
You kissed me?
!
I didn't!
I stopped!
Pervert!
Lech!
Fiend!
I can't believe you!
It's because you talk in your sleep and toss and turn so much!
Those kids are embarrassing us again.

Hey, have you seen her yet?
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Seen who?
You dork, you haven't seen the foreign girl yet?
Foreign girl?
Yeah, she's in 8th grade, Class A.
She just transferred here last week.
She's hot!
Her name's Asuka Langley Sohryu, did you know that?
Yeah, she's so cute.
Since she was raised over there but born here, do you think she already has a boyfriend?
Don't be stupid!
I bet she broke up in Germany, and she's here in a foreign land with a heart that can't be mended.
Oh my gosh...
Did you hear all the cat talk?
Asuka!
Asuka!
They're just ignorant.
Thank you, come again.
At least the pictures don't reveal her personality.
Hello!
Shinji!
Guten Morgen!
Guten Morgen.
Hey, why so gloomy?
This is the gorgeous Asuka greeting you!
You should appreciate your good fortune!
I'm the most popular girl in school!
Hey, the other one's here too, isn't she?
Other one?
What are you, stupid?
I'm talking about the First Child, of course!
Oh, Ayanami...
Hello!
You must be Rei Ayanami, the pilot of the prototype.
I'm Asuka!
Asuka Langley Sohryu.
I'm the designated pilot of Eva Unit 02.
Let's be good friends!
Why?
Because it'd be convenient.
You know what I mean?
If I'm ordered to, I will.
Talk about odd.
I'll say.
Are only weirdos chosen to be pilots?
You've lost some weight.
Is that so?
You must be enduring an unrequited love.
How did you know?
Because...
"A woman with a mole in the pathway of her tears is destined to a life full of them."
If you're trying to put a move on me, I'm afraid you can't.
There's a very ugly face observing us.
Long time no see, Kaji.
It's been a while.
You're a little less discreet than I expected.
He hasn't ever been discreet in his life!
You've handed over Unit 02, right?
You should be leaving now!
I just received orders this morning that I'll be staying here on loan.
So we can hang around again, just like we used to.
You've got to be kidding!
Enemy attack?
!
We just got this report from the battle cruiser Haruna.
"Huge submerged object detected off Ki'i peninsula.
Sending data."
The data has been collated and examined.
Wavelength pattern Blue.
Confirmed to be an Angel.
All personnel, go to first stage alert.
The recent battle severely damaged the intercept system.
Only twenty-six percent of our defense capability is available.
And our operational capability for actual combat is virtually nil.
Therefore, we're going to have to intercept the target at the water's edge, right before it makes landfall!
Units 01 and 02 will mount an attack in a series of waves.
In other words, close in and take turns.
Roger.
This sucks.
My Japanese debut, and she won't let me solo.
Why do I have to bring you?
!
It can't be helped.
Procedures, you know?
Well, let me tell you something, just don't get in my way!
His selection as a pilot must have been a joke, right?
Two against one is not what I call a fair fight.
It's not fair.
We don't get a choice.
Survival takes priority.
There!
Commence attack!
I'll handle this Angel!
You cover me!
Cover you?
Ladies first!
Damn it, don't give me orders, you dumb rookie!
Charge!
That wasn't bad.
What did you think of that, Third Child?
!
A fight should be clean, elegant and without waste.
What's this crap?
Today, at 10:58:15 AM,
Unit 01 was attacked by Target Alpha, which separated from the target submerged 2 km off Suruga Bay.
At the same time, plus 20 seconds, Unit 02 was halted by Target Beta.
We have a comment from E-Project chairperson.
This is pathetic.
This is all your fault!
You totally screwed up my debut battle!
What are you talking about?
You're the one who charged in there acting like an idiot!
Idiot?
!
How dare you call me that?
Pathetic excuse for a combat pilot!
You're just a jerk!
Look in the mirror!
In your rush to show off, you completely ignored procedures!
Look in the mirror!
In your rush to show off, you completely ignored procedures!
What was that?
You look like a drowned rat!
At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned the operation What was that?
You look like a drowned rat!
At 11:03 AM, NERV abandoned the operation You can't say that kind of thing to me!
You can't say that kind of thing to me!
and transferred command to the UN Secondary Force.
We've been humiliated.
At 11:05 AM, the UN forces made an attack with an N2 mine.
We'll have to re-draw the map again.
They succeeded in burning off 28% of target's structural substance.
Did they kill it?
They succeeded in burning off 28% of target's structural substance.
Did they kill it?
This is merely temporary relief.
A second attack is a matter of time.
This is merely temporary relief.
A second attack is a matter of time.
At least we have time to regroup.
You can't ask for more than that.
Listen up, you two.
Do you know what your job is?
Piloting Eva.
No!
Your job is to defeat the Angels.
NERV does not exist to make grotesque displays like this.
Therefore, you two must cooperate.
Why should we?
!
Enough already.
Why does everyone get so angry here?
It's because adults are much too aware of their credibility.
Where's Misato?
Clearing things up.
The person in charge must take responsibility.
Here are the internal protests and damage reports.
This is a bill from the UN, and here you have complaints from the PR department as well.
Read them all.
I can tell what they say without looking.
"If you're going to fight, don't do it here," right?
Good guess.
I'll do it as soon as we take care of this Angel.
I swear I will destroy that Angel.
The Vice Commander is pretty angry.
You'll almost certainly be demoted if you embarrass him again.
It was good luck within bad luck that Commander Ikari wasn't here.
If he'd been here, you'd have been fired before he ever saw these.
So, have you brought me an idea to help save my job?
Just one.
I thank you, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.
It's good to have a friend one can count on.
However, I'm not the one who'll be saving my old friend.
This is Kaji's idea.
Kaji?
I'm home!
Not that anyone's here, of course, but...
What is this?
!
Don't be so rude!
Those are my personal belongings!
You!
What in the blazes are you doing in my house?
Why are you still here?
Still here?
You've been dumped for the new model!
Misato will be living with me.
That's a more logical choice when you consider my superior abilities.
Although honestly, I'd rather live with Kaji.
Say, just why are Japanese houses so small anyway?
Not even half of my stuff fits!
And the Japanese sure don't have any sense of privacy.
How can they live in a room without locks?
Unbelievable!
It's because the Japanese way is to consider the priorities and needs of others before one's own.
Misato!
How are you?
You two are going to get along real well, right?
What do you mean?
This is all preparation for the next operation.
Say what?
There is only one way to destroy the seventh Angel!
A simultaneous two-point attack on each target's core while its components are separated.
In other words, an attack by two Evas with synchronized timing.
Cooperation and coordination between you will be paramount.
Therefore, I want the two of you to live together.
No way!
A boy and girl should never sleep together after the age of seven!
No way!
A boy and girl should never sleep together after the age of seven!
The Angel is currently restoring itself.
It will begin its second assault in six days, so there's no time.
But it's impossible.
Now, we have a way to make it possible!
The master attack pattern will be choreographed using this music.
In six days, as soon as possible.
I'm worried about Shinji.
He's been gone three days, right?
Hey, there's the class rep.
Two of the three stooges.
Why are you here?
To offer condolences to Miss Sohryu.
What about you two?
To offer condolences to lkari.
Why did you stop here?
Yes?
You've betrayed us!
You look like two peas in a pod.
I can't believe this!
Neither can we.
It's all Misato's fault!
We have to eat, breathe and sleep together!
You're living in sin!
How awful!
No, it's not like that!
Then, just what is it like?
Hi, welcome everybody!
Why don't you explain all this to us?
You should have told us that first.
How is the coordination coming?
Well, as you can see.
Well, so much for synchronization!
I could never sink to the pathetic level this animated turnip lives at!
If you ask me, this whole idea is impossible!
Then you give up?
But you don't have anyone else, do you?
Rei?
Yes, Ma'am.
Rei?
Yes, Ma'am.
Why don't you try?
Why don't you try?
Yes, Ma'am.
Why don't you try?
Yes, Ma'am.
It looks like I should alter the operation to pair Shinji and Rei.
No!
I can't stand this!
I can't take it anymore!
Asuka!
Even the Devil cries sometimes.
Asuka!
Even the Devil cries sometimes.
Ikari!
You've got to follow her!
You made her cry!
It's your fault!
Well...
Don't say anything.
Well...
Don't say anything.
I know.
I have to pilot the Eva.
I've got no choice.
I'll do it.
No matter what, I'll put Rei and Misato to shame!
You don't have to squash them.
You're being too simplistic, even if you are a man!
I must avenge myself.
My pride...
It's a matter of honor now, you see?
Where's Misato?
At work.
She called earlier.
She'll be there all night.
So that means we're all alone tonight.
This is the impenetrable "Wall of Jericho", Third Child.
Take one step over this wall and you'll be a dead man.
And now, it's time for children to go to bed!
Why do the Japanese sleep on the floor?
This is so stupid.
Mama...
Mama...
You're just a child yourself.
No, somebody will see us.
Who's watching?
Someb...
Who's watching?
Someb...
No!
There's nothing between us anymore.
Don't do that again.
But your lips didn't say no.
Which one should I trust?
Your lips or your words?
There you go.
Thanks.
You're unusually sober today.
Yeah, a little.
Work?
Or a man?
A lot of things.
Still in love?
Don't be ridiculous!
Who'd want that idiot?
!
I was young, and it's still the biggest blemish on my whole life.
I meant that he may still like you.
Did I scare you?
Why you lousy...
You're only proving my hypothesis.
Why don't you go with your feelings?
It's not like it's still eight years ago.
It hasn't changed.
Not a bit.
He's still immature.
Well, I've got to get to work.
Tomorrow is D-day.
Target has broken through the final defense line at Gora.
Here it comes!
We won't fail this time!
Spread your ATfields as soon as the music starts.
Then follow the operation choreography.
Are you two ready?
Roger!
The target has entered the mountains.
Just remember Shinji, full power, maximum performance.
I know that.
We'll finish in sixty-two seconds.
Target entering Ground Zero.
Detach external power cables.
Launch.
Confirmation.
Both Evas are operational.
Geez...
This is pathetic.
You jerk!
What are you doing on my Unit 02?
!
What are you talking about?
You're the one who fell on me!
You're the one who lost his timing first!
You're always so slow!
What were you doing, staying up so late last night?
!
Image training for today's battle!
Liar!
I know you tried to kiss me while I was sleeping!
You cheat!
You were awake?
Oh, my gosh!
I was just kidding!
Did you really kiss me?
!
No, I didn't!
I stopped!
Pervert!
Fiend!
Idiot!
I can't believe this!
You caused it by calling for your mother and sleepwalking!
Those kids are embarrassing us again.
The crater of Mount Asama where an unhatched Angel lies.
Misato immediately requests the announcement of an A-17.
NERV personnel attempt the first capture of an Angel under top priority circumstances.
An Eva with special equipment challenges the fires of Hell!
It's an extreme environment of high heat and pressure.
What did Asuka see there?
It's the next episode:
"Magma Diver"
And I'll give you more service!

Good morning!
Good morning!
Champagne in the middle of the day?
It's alright for some.
Tasting for tomorrow's show.
Want some?
If that's okay.
Sure.
Here are the press clippings.
Thank you.
What do you think?
It's Krug.
Typical 'Enrico Dandolo'!
No other label gives this stuff to the press!
Times like these, we've got to keep up appearances.
I heard a rumor.
Ataka Trading's pulling the plug on your deal.
What?
That's hardly likely.
Maybe.
Aren't you going out with their Okano-san?
Doesn't he tell you anything?
It's just rumor.
Our spring collection sold well.
So they say...
Can't we shift that Enrico dandolo spring stuff?
You mean, just dump it, Okano-san?
Sure.
Remember to rip off the label.
Discount stores, wholesalers.
Get rid of all 2,000.
Hello.
Delivery.
Mr. Ota, sign here, please.
OTA
You wanted to see me?
Cleared up the Enrico Dandolo matter?
Taken care of.
And the fall collection?
We just paid 3 million.
It's shipping now.
That's not good.
Their CFO just quit...
Pull the plug... call in our debts.
This is my department's problem.
You stay out of it.
407, Hosokawa here.
Finished in Shibaura.
Thank you.
407 Shibaura done.
407, to Shimbashi!
407, Shimbashi, please!
Shimbashi, got it.
No way!
Get lost.
Take a look at this.
What?
Know who this is?
'Tim Grey'; only world-class designer not exporting to Japan.
That dirty bastard?
Say something?
Nothing.
Are you coming to bed?
Not yet. 30 more minutes.
You go ahead.
Hey there!
Enrico Dandolo really suits you.
So, do you like the champagne I chose?
Yeah, not bad.
It's '89 Krug Clot du Menil.
Worth every penny at $500 a pop.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Hold these...
ENRICO DANDOLO BANKRUPT
Two days earlier than I expected...
It really suits you.
Really.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Okano here.
What?
I'll be right there.
What's up?
!
It's about to start!
Are you sure?
What's going on?
Where are you going?
How come you left it so late?
!
We put 3 million for the Fall collection.
We're working with Citibank to get it back.
What are our prospects?
They'll close the 12 department store locations...
And we'll take care of the flagship store.
And from now on?
Well, er... we...
Okano's leaving for New York tonight, to scout for a new brand.
Right.
Huh?
Out of the way.
What are you doing?
We're from Ataka Trading.
We're seizing assets as collateral against our investment.
Over here!
But nobody told me anything!
Where in New York am I going?
The offices of Tim Grey.
Do you think we stand a chance?
The ground work's done.
See how it goes.
Okay.
Thanks.
One more thing.
Naomi Shimizu.
What about her?
Housing... car...
lifestyle.
You helped her use company cash.
Let me explain.
What are you going to do?
Do?
First things first.
Gotta save my own neck.
She's up to you.
So I can do what I want?
Sure.
Take care of it.
I've already got it planned.
Shit.
Too late.
Messy room.
For a chick.
That leaves the Alpha Romeo downstairs.
It's Okano.
Sorry I can't come to the phone...
Just when I need you...
Look what you've done to my car!
Are you okay?
Sorry.
I was in a hurry.
Shouldn't I get an ambulance?
Damn!
Could you deliver this for me?
Do what?
It's late.
Mr. Yoshioka...
loan section...
that bank over there.
They've got to have this by 3pm.
First, let me call you an ambulance.
Wait!
I'll be fine.
You don't look fine.
They're waiting for it.
Please.
For Chrissakes.
Okay.
Just hand it over, right?
This is for Yoshioka of finance.
Please wait a moment.
Get a move on.
I'll keep a look out for her.
That won't be necessary.
Naomi Shimizu, right?
What the hell are you doing?
Apartment, car, cell phone...
it all belongs to Ataka Trading.
You're from Ataka Trading?
So, you'd know Okano.
Where is he?
He's abroad.
He told me to clear this up.
Clear what up?
Neither he, nor the company wants anything to do with you.
What are you talking about?
Okano wouldn't do this!
Give it back!
Let me have it!
You asshole!
If it helps my company, you can call me what you like.
Let's ask her to leave.
Get Okano!
Ouch!
What have I done?
Oh, thank you.
That's enough.
Let go!
So you're the hit-and-run.
'Hit-and-run'?
What the hell's going on?
Sorry.
Just when business was taking off.
Now the motorbikes will get all our new clients.
Maye it's time to call it a day.
When we began... we said we'd quit if the other got hurt.
Maybe we've reached that point...
We're just piling up debts.
Best to quit now...
Hang on...
Did my lips move?
Reached what 'point'?
Only Japan still relies on motorbike couriers, right?
Bicycle messengers are bound to catch on.
So relax.
Just worry about getting better.
Um...
Leave it me.
I'll take your customers.
No sweat!
Gotta get going.
When was this 'hit-and-run'?
He asked me to deliver something.
No present abode?
I was thrown out today.
No employment.
The company just folded.
No insurance.
We checked.
They're all cancelled.
That asshole.
No address, job, insurance...
You picked a great time to cause an accident.
Come in.
Excuse me.
We contacted him.
Broken leg.
It'll be 2 months.
Shigekazu Yokota?
I know this guy!
He'll probably settle out of court.
Out of court?
Here he is.
Yokota, you still alive?
Shimano-san!
Riding like that, I knew you'd end up here one day.
Here she is...
You're looking better than expected...
Smashed your leg?
They'll patch you up.
Don't worry...
I'm Naomi Shimizu.
No business card, 'hello' will have to do!
Nice of you to come...
So, about this settlement...
It'd normally be cash, but I'm clean broke.
But there are more important things...
like kindness...
You have my complete support...
I'll do everything I can.
Er... thank you.
Glad we've sorted that out.
So, take care then!
Wait a second.
What?
Anything else I can do?
You said you'd do anything... yeah?
Well, surely not...
You don't mean...
I'd have to think about it...
Would you take over my bike-messenger route?
Until I get better.
So we keep our new clients.
That's the settlement.
You will do it, won't you?
Is that all?
I wondered what you meant...
Who does he think I am?
Me?
Doing shit like that?
So, you don't want to settle?
Of course not!
No way.
You said you've got nowhere to stay.
Yeah, I was kicked out.
How about staying at my place?
Really?
Is that okay?
That's not really fair.
You're going to press charges?
If they can't settle it out of court...
Wait.
Wait a minute!
Hello?
Could you get the manager?
I believe it's Suzuki.
My name's Naomi Shimizu.
I'm a new partner here.
I don't really work in places like this but... it's better than jail.
Maybe it'll be interesting...
Er...
Yes?
Who are you?
I told you.
Naomi Shimizu.
I won't say it again.
Get the manager, okay?
It's me.
I'm Suzuki.
Really?
As you heard from Yokota, his bike scraped my car and he broke some bones.
I'm standing in for him, until he recovers.
You hit him; you should...
Pottering around on these?
Easy enough.
Got one with a motor?
That'd be best.
Bicycles are faster.
Are you nuts?
I don't like you.
Clear off.
Hello, Tokyo Express.
Sorry.
We're going to be late.
Yokota fell and hurt himself.
Ut I'm handling his deliveries.
2pm?
That's a bit tough.
If it was 3pm... no, that's no good either.
Please, wait a minute!
I'll make it!
He hung up.
Changing room's over there.
It's such a tacky shirt!
It's bright to stop you getting hit.
And this bag.
It's in the way!
Wear it like this.
What's up with these shoes?
They clip into the pedals.
What a nuisance...
It's more efficient.
Like this.
This is easy!
Follow me and remember the way.
Fussy jerk.
It's just a bicycle.
Wow!
Wait for me!
Why're you making me do this?
Oh, by the way... do y'know how to stop?
Of course I frigging do!
Any idiot knows that!
I can't release them.
Best do it before you stop.
Thanks for telling me.
Wait!
Terai Printing
That's a shame, isn't it?
Well, I got a replacement.
Should be no sweat.
A replacement?
Hi there.
Please to meet you.
Don't move.
Stay there.
Wait for me!
Did you see that?
Wasn't that Naomi?
No way...
I couldn't ride another inch.
That's it for today.
Women are over there.
Why a public bath?
Couldn't we go to a health spa?
Sunburn!
So I took off in pursuit, but I forgot how low that Sengakuji tunnel is.
Smashed the roof in.
What a thing to do, just before I retire.
Once the melanin binds to the epidermis there's no getting rid of it...
Especially in your 30's.
Not that I'm there yet, but... how's the new apprentice?
Better not to ask.
What are you doing here?
This is my regular spot.
Two beers, please.
What's this?
After a hard day, gotta have beer.
This is what it's all about!
You are joking?
You can't choose what I drink.
Krug Grand Cuvée if you don't have Vintage.
Kroog?
Champagne.
The very best.
Veuve Clicquot?
It'll have to do.
Champagne.
How can people drink anything else?
What sweaty jerk would want beer...
Has it been like this all day?
The whole world revolves around her.
I'm beat.
Pay my check, I'm going home.
'Home'?
Wasn't it, 'no present abode'?
So, then.
Getting me back to your room, huh?
You and Yokota, that's all you're after...
Wait a sec...
Let's get something straight.
For a girl like me, we're talking three posh dinners and then a luxury hotel.
You can't just skip the process and get straight to it.
Did my lips move?
Here's the key.
Use it 'til he gets better.
He?
Isn't it your room?
It's Yokota's.
Tomorrow 8am.
Don't be late.
Hello, it's Terai Printing.
We need an urgent delivery to a client.
Hello?
Why so many damn hills?
Oggi Fashion Magazine
Excuse me.
I've been trying to find you.
Where've you been?
Where?
Well...
I'm with a new company.
It's been very busy.
A new company?
Fashion...
PR...
I was headhunted.
And that package?
This is... um...
Somebody asked me to deliver it.
Here.
Have you got a tan?
A tan.
Yes, I was...
Um... on Bora-Bora for a few days.
I'm late.
Got to meet a new designer at the airport...
So crazy busy.
Shouldn't I sign for it?
Bicycle messenger service.
Please take one.
Please take one.
Please...
Hey.
This is our territory.
We don't want you scuttling around.
Got it?
What kind of bike is this?
Doesn't even have a mud-guard...
For Chrissakes.
Tokyo Express.
Where the hell have you got to?
I'm so sorry.
About that settlement.
Can we call it quits?
What the hell do you mean?
!
Okay, clear out and go back home!
Don't talk to me like that!
What about your dream of being a photographer?
If you don't have the guts for city life, go home.
You, of all people, should understand.
What?
Bike messengers will never catch on.
But Japan's the only country still relying on motorbike couriers.
If we keep at it, bicycles will become the norm.
And you really believe that?
Yumiko.
Take this back.
I'll be on the 3pm bus tomorrow.
Look after yourself.
Gotta go.
Excuse me.
I'll come back another time.
Beer.
With much appreciation for all you've done...
I regret to say I'm handing in my resignation.
You can't stop me, once my mind's made up.
Don't worry, I'm not asking for redundancy pay.
If you'll excuse me.
Hang on.
What?
Did my lips move?
I never expected much of you.
Why the hell not?
Don't get too snobby about it.
It's just riding bicycles.
What do you mean, 'just'?
You don't understand.
Understand?
I more than understand.
Rushing all over the place, making less than $50...
Arriving covered in sweat for not even a 'thank you'?
We're not giving out gifts, looking for thanks...
Japan is the only place where couriers use motorbikes.
So?
Isn't that easiest?
You're living in dreamland.
That's why everyone quits.
What happened at the hospital?
Nothing.
So, if you don't expect anything from me...
I'll quit and try to get into PR.
Another beer.
You're Naomi Shimizu?
I had to come back for this.
It's the first camera I bought in Tokyo.
Tokyo Express's first day.
Everyone looks so young.
Here.
Thank you.
I don't know how to put this...
Maybe it's all my fault.
And I feel bad.
That's alright.
I'd already decided to leave Tokyo.
Really?
I wasn't much of a photographer anyway.
It was an excuse to get away from home.
Yokota had a proper job lined up.
But joined his buddy in this business.
It went well at first.
But the motorbike couriers squeezed them out.
Their friends all quit.
I was worried but Yokota told me to stay out of it.
Towards the end, we were always fighting...
Maybe it's not my place to say but... perhaps with some time apart or...
Forget it.
Maybe if he'd asked me not to go...
But it's fine.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Tokyo Express... er...
Naomi speaking.
Delivery?
I'm off today.
Yokota?
Could you hand this to Yumiko?
Hand it to her?
She's going back to Nagano.
Tokyo bus station. 3pm.
Make sure she gets it before she leaves.
Wouldn't it be better if Suzuki took it?
I can't worry him with anything else.
Damn, it's early.
It ain't my fault.
I can always mail it.
'Make sure she gets it before she leaves... '
'Maybe if he'd asked me not to go.... '
'But it's fine...
I'm going... '
For Chrissakes.
Wait!
Bus.
Wait!
Out of the way.
Wait!
Bus, stop!
Stop the bus!
I'm telling you to stop!
Stop the damn thing!
Just a minute!
What are you doing here?
Whatever.
Take this.
Hello?
Okay.
Alright.
I'll come back.
Thank you.
Beer.
I said 'beer'.
What the hell are you doing?
This isn't mine.
Get me a champagne, like always.
That's the good stuff.
After a hard day, it's Veuve Clicquot.
You stopped Yumiko leaving?
Yokota told me on the phone.
I felt obliged... since I broke his leg.
I haven't decided not to quit...
Don't get the wrong idea.
It ain't so simple.
I don't like riding the damn things.
Hang on.
Yes?
Did my lips move?
What is it with you and bicycles?
What do you mean?
You could use anything, right?
Why use a bicycle?
Remember when you first learned to ride?
I was so thrilled.
To be able to go so fast, get so far away...
How can I put it...?
Like there was nothing I couldn't do.
I still feel that way.
This is all way too personal.
I meant, what's the business logic behind it.
Damn amateurs.
No business sense at all.
I'm giving out these flyers.
There's no point chucking these about.
Sales is all about defining your market.
Focus on companies looking to cut costs.
In the world I'm from, there are people who'd sell their own mothers to save the company cash.
It pisses me off when I think of that asshole.
Hey.
Introduce me to him.
There's no guarantee he'll give us work.
Besides I don't want to see him.
Ataka Trading's just up here.
No, it's past the station.
Past it?
Let's turn left here.
We'll have to use the bridge, unless you want to cross the tracks.
There's a short cut.
You might have warned me!
Jerk!
What's up with that?
What?
What about sunburn?
It feels better like this.
Is Ota-san here?
I'm afraid he's not.
Audit department...
Ota-san?
I'm at Citibank.
Get that contract over here.
Can you take this, too?
Yes, of course.
Excuse me.
It's Naomi Shimizu.
Nice to talk to you again.
I thought we had concluded things.
I totally agree, however... unfortunately I find myself, working as a bicycle messenger.
We're cheaper than anyone in a 10km radius.
I'd love it if Ataka Trading would use us.
No.
It's cheap, but in today's world speed counts for everything.
So, I turn you down.
Give the phone back.
I told you.
Where should it go?
To Ota, at the Citibank HQ.
Urgent.
Right away.
Hey, you...
I'm busy, you take this one.
Surely you wouldn't deal with these losers?
Who are you calling 'loser'?
Hey, hey.
In business, we keep our cool.
Sorry about this.
He's just young.
Times must be hard with you.
Why?
Can't get the staff?
Having to pull in old broads like that...
Who's the 'old broad'?
In business, don't we keep cool?
Let me go.
I'll take it.
It's on its way.
And... hey!
It's Naomi Shimizu, again.
You still there?
If we prove we're faster, you'll give us the job?
What?
Lend me this!
What are you up to?
Get this to Mr. Ota at Citibank.
Time to prove that you're faster than them.
No sweat!
Why are you on patrol on your last day?
Better than being behind a desk.
That bicycle just ran the light.
Forget it.
Shall I go after him?
No, not today.
What's this?
A delivery from your office.
It's me.
Is she still there?
Clear off.
Because of you, we lost the Ataka Trading account.
That's half a million bucks.
What do you have to say?
But I...
Get out of my sight.
I don't want to see you again.
Champagne.
What she always drinks...
Huh?
What the hell're you doing?
This ain't mine.
It's yours.
Beer for me.
Look at this.
A contract.
Isn't it great?
From tomorrow we've got a hundred daily deliveries.
We're definitely going to make some cash.
That's impossible.
What is?
My limit's thirty drops a day.
You're kidding!
What are we going to do?
We can't chuck it now.
Chuck it?
If it's too much for two, we gotta find people.
Find people?
At twenty drops a day each, we'd need five people.
By tonight?
Forget it.
Five people?
How many is it now?
How many...?
Er...
That motorbike guy.
Hey, you!
Looking for revenge?
Name's Hattori.
I just got fired.
But I gotta keep sending the cash back to my Mom...
I'll do anything.
Please let me join!
Shimano-san too?
On the occasion of my honorable retirement... remembering my junior years on bicycle patrol.
You're in.
So that's...
All five people.
Right.
From tomorrow... ah, what's your name again?
It's Hattori.
Hey, can you ride a bicycle?
I love to.
Here we go!
One hundred drops a day.
You all did good today.
How many did we do?
77 deliveries.
Motorbikes got the rest.
But we did at least 100 kilometers!
What's this 'plus two'?
I took over all of his.
So he didn't even do one?
I'm very sorry.
We've got to work something out.
But what 'something'?
Hang on.
Something's wierd.
'Wierd'?
It's wierd that she's drinking beer.
Oh shit.
I thought you only drank champagne.
What are you doing?
Having a BEER.
Rushing fifty times to the same place,
I'm so parched I'm dying for one.
Say what you like.
Wait a minute!
What now?
What did you say?
I said 'Say what you like'.
Before that.
'I'm having a beer'.
That's too far.
After that.
'Hurrying fifty times to the same place'.
That's it!
What is?
If we keep passing the same point, we'd do better to link up somewhere and make it one trip.
One trip?
For example...
Suppose this road and this road, cross like this.
Two riders could meet and hand over the mail.
But they'd have to wait to cross the road.
Only for motorbikes.
It's easy for us to be on the same side.
Wouldn't we waste time hanging around?
Not if someone coordinates us all by radio.
There's no engine noise so we can talk and ride.
A buddy of mine'll sell us cheap taxi radios.
We can do it!
But who'll coordinate?
That's gotta be me.
Nobody knows the roads like me and besides...
'Besides'?
As you've all noticed...
I'm useless on a bicycle.
Tokyo Express.
Terai Printing, how are you?
To Oggi Magazine?
Suzuki, location?
Meiji St., Fourth Bridge.
Can you reach Terai in eight minutes?
No sweat!
We'll be there in eight minutes.
Thank you.
Tokyo Express.
Ataka Trading, hello there.
Over to Dentsu Inc.?
Just a moment.

No sweat.
Yumiko, hand over to Hattori, Ikura crossing.

Head for the Ginza 4th in four, pick up from Hattori, take it to Oggi Magazine.
Please sign here.
Thanks.
Thank you!
Dear Mom...
This month, we did a total of $30,000!
Let's celebrate!
To reaching $30,000!
Cheers!
Is that you, Ota?
Do me a favor.
Get hold of Naomi Shimizu.
Not that again.
Not at all.
We need her for the Tim Grey deal.
Do you know where she is?
As a matter of fact...
Stay still, you're drunk.
Who's drunk?
Don't blame me!
You're hammered too.
Stop wobbling around!
What?
I've lost 3kgs since I started this!
Hey.
I never had a chance to say it properly...
Say what?
Bringing Yumiko back...
Getting more clients for us...
I couldn't have done it by myself.
So...
Well...
Please... don't leave.
What are you doing?
Watch it!
I hurt my back!
Are you okay?
Of course I'm not!
I was feeling so good but now you've ruined it.
I'll walk home from here.
Good night.
'Please don't leave... '
You're getting out?
Maybe next week.
But you could stay a little longer to be safe.
Naomi and I are doing fine with the deliveries.
Yumiko, you just don't get it.
Naomi-san isn't cut out for that job.
I had no choice but to ask her and I've worried about it ever since.
But she really seems to enjoy it.
I'm counting the minutes 'til I can set her free.
That's why I'm trying for a quick recovery.
Where is everyone?
They've gone for a beer.
What are you going to do?
I'm so tanned now.
I can't go back to my old job for ages.
It's your responsibility.
Responsibility?
Since I can't go back, you've got to keep me...
Working here...
Hello, Tokyo Express.
Yes she's here.
An Okano-san for you.
You've got a nerve calling me.
Don't tell me you forgot what you did!
What did I...
When the company folded, you dumped me and went abroad!
It was a misunderstanding!
Misunderstanding?
Company orders.
I had to be in New York.
I kept trying to reach you.
I didn't know what happened to you until I got back.
Anyway, I got the contract with Tim Grey.
We're going to resurrect Enrico Dandolo and own their franchise, and guess who's doing all the PR?
I went to NY to get back what you lost.
Tokyo Express with a delivery from Citibank.
Okano will be in touch with you soon.
You're going to hand Naomi back to our company.
That Okano guy, what's his relationship with her?
A sexual one.
She doesn't belong with the likes of you.
Besides, she might even make us some money.
That's all I have to say.
How come Suzuki and Naomi aren't here tonight?
Right.
Maybe they went on a date.
Really?
Things are getting more interesting.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Where did you go last night?
What do you mean?
Were you with Naomi?
No.
I went straight back home.
I see...
My name is Okano, Ataka Trading.
My apologies for everything.
Please accept this.
This should cover the liability of Naomi Shimizu.
Damages, medical bills, compensation.
We can't accept it.
Why not?
It's up to her whether she goes or stays.
That's settled.
She's already made up her mind.
I don't believe you.
I'm sweating like a pig.
What are you wearing?
!
What're you doing here?
Let's go, there's a lot to discuss.
I booked you into a hotel...
But I still have some deliveries to do.
Don't tell me that's more important than Tim Grey.
That money covers the settlement.
A car's waiting, let's go.
But I made a promise after the accident, that I'd be a messenger until Yokota gets better.
I can't just quit now.
Didn't I?
Yes, that's right.
She promised.
Yup, that's correct.
Until Yokota comes back she'll stay with us.
Right.
Hi, everyone!
I'm back at last!
Didn't you say next week?
Yes.
But for Naomi's sake I discharged myself earlier.
Who's this?
Stay out of it, you'll just complicate things.
I 'm here to take Naomi for a new PR job.
Really?
Congratulattons...
Now that I'm back, you've nothing to worry about.
She hasn't said she's gonna leave yet!
You're so dim, Yumiko...
No doubt Naomi-san wants to return to the fashion business.
But she put up with us until I got better.
Why can't you understand?
No, that's not it...
Anyway, I'm very happy for you.
Good luck.
Uh... thanks...
Come on, I can't waste any more time.
Say something, Suzuki!
Go, if you want.
Nice meeting you all.
Can you give us work from your section?
I'm sorry but I can't.
I was told only to use bicycle messengers.
Sorry.
Damn it.
Hello?
What?
I can't hear you...
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Okano.
His desk's over there.
Thank you.
Here's a delivery.
Could you sign?
Excuse me, could you come over here?
Sure, I'll be right there.
Wait a minute...
OKANO
Here.
Thank you.
We've booked this room for you for six months.
And these are your clothes.
What?
They said they didn't receive it.
They were furious.
But...
I'm sure I delivered it.
Here's the receipt.
OKANO
Is he the guy from the other day?
You've got the receipt?
So what?
One of you signed and took the contract, right?
What the hell for?
Your idea of revenge?
You hate the fact I got Naomi back.
If you have something to say to me, spit it out!
Don't mix it up with business.
Would have thought you had more pride...
What the hell...
I'm deeply sorry.
We both regret what happened.
We hope to work something out peaceably.
Personally I think I'm wasting my time, but since you threatened Okano with force, compensation is necessary.
Excuse me.
I don't remember calling you...
Well, I heard of the incident and would like to make a proposal.
Hey, you have nothing to do with this!
A proposal?
Yes.
We'd like to have a race against Tokyo Express.
A race?
Now that our price is the same as theirs,
I'm sure you'd have no objection if... the winner gets all your account, right?
A replacement race.
Nobody knows the details of the delivery until we get an order.
Under equal circumstances, we'll have a fair delivery competition.
Fair?
Don't make me laugh!
You have 500 people and we only have four!
You have a clear advantage over us anyway!
Do you still call this a fair fight?
All right.
You should know... that this is your penalty.
And you have no right to refuse it.
But, it's just not...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have raised my voice.
Come here!
I'll explain the rules.
The delivery is to Ataka Trading.
We don't know when or from where it'll come.
There'll be a call sometime tomorrow.
We pick up the delivery then head to Ataka.
We can take any route, any number of people.
The first person to deliver wins.
How do we do it?
Suzuki is the fastest, he'll run the longest distance.
So he'll wait in the center of the city.
The rest disperse and cover all the areas.
We all give the delivery to Suzuki and he takes the rest.
In other words...
Once you reach this tunnel, you win!
Four pathetic bikes against us, 500 motorbikes!
There's no way we lose!
We're gonna trash them tomorrow!
Do you hear me?
Dismissed!
Hey.
I've got something else for you guys.
To be on the safe side.
We can't lose this time.
Thanks.
We may be the underdog... but none of us think it was your fault.
Besides, you're the one who started this business, and I decided to join because I believed in you.
We've had our ups and downs, but I really appreciate all you've done.
So, the race tomorrow...
I'll do anything to win.
By the way, since I got back, Yumiko and others won't talk to me.
I may be wrong, but are they angry because I sent Naomi away?
I wasn't sure but... did you have a crush on Naomi?
Are you kidding?
Where on earth did you get that idea from?
She's stuck up, rude and has no charm at all.
And she's five years older than me!
Girls like that are after posh dinners and fancy hotels...
Besides, I'm more worried about tomorrow's race!
Hey.
Did my lips move?
Tomorrow?
Tim Grey's coming to sign the contract in Japan.
We 'd like you to be there.
I'll pick you up at noon.
Okay.
It's me.
He left the airport?
Okay, we'll be there.
I'll make sure to take Naomi Shimizu.
I'll see you later.
To Ataka Trading.
Right.
Any taxi in Shinjuku area come in?
Something wrong?
Nothing.
Shit, they overtook us!
I was in a hurry and...
Shut up.
Show me your licence.
I'm sorry but please hurry.
Your name is Hataoka...
How lucky!
Could you excuse me for a second?
Hello, it's me.
There's an emergency!
Were you caught speeding?
Jesus!
I told you to be careful!
Where are you now?
Nishi-Shinjuku?
You're that close?
Never mind.
I'm coming!
Show time.
Gotcha.
Give it to Yumiko in 3 minutes at Aoyama crossing!
Alright!
Some weirdoes are after me!
What?
Yumiko, location?
I'm at the Gaien Art Museum.
Hattori's in trouble.
Head to Sendagkya via Gaien West St.
What happened?
Sorry, they got me!
My bike, too.
Yumiko, location?
By the National Stadium!
Take out the envelope!
Come on, just do it!
I've taken it out, but...
Hold it up!
20km/h over the limit.
That'll be $100.
If you don't pay, we'll call your company.
Hey.
Chief, I'm really sorry!
Just shut up and hand it over!
Here.
I'm sorry...
What're you doing?
How're you doing, Yumiko?
I'm heading south, Gaien West St.
It's Yokota and I'm at the Nishiazabu crossing.
Yokota, help Yumiko!
Head towards Gaien West!
Hang in there, Yumiko!
Somebody, help me!
Yumiko?
!
What the hell's she doing?
Hey, don't do that!
....
The bikes are in our way.
Get the envelope from Yumiko.
Alright!
Where?
Hey, watch out!
Idiot.
Gimme a break!
Yokota, location?
Gaien West, heading north.
Tell me exactly!
Passing the Bell Commons building!
Yumiko, get the envelope!
Three
Two
One
Let go!
Gotcha!
Way to go!
Go after him!
What the hell!
A race?
It's so ridiculous.
Wise of you to leave them.
Suzuki, at the Tengenji crossing.
Head to Hiroo, get the envelope from Yokota!
No sweat!
They're still coming!
Do your best 'til you pass it to Suzuki...!
Follow that bicycle, please!
Come on!
What are you doing?
I can't go on.
Look what you've done to my car!
What're you gonna do about it?
Are you okay?
Are you alright?
No sweat!
We're counting on you!
Shouldn't I get an ambulance?
Look, your leg is...
Wait here.
Not again!
Stop here!
Are you going to be late for Tim Grey?
I've made up my mind.
But you'll lose everything.
What's there to lose?
Suzuki, location?
Gyoran Hill.
Nearly on Route 15.
You're our only hope!
No sweat.
Is the ambulance here yet?
No way...
Shit...
Where are you going?
Are you okay?
I got them all and I'm heading for the finish.
Suzuki, location?
Suzuki, location?
Suzuki, location?
Isarago hill.
Something wrong?
I did my leg in, but I'm okay.
Are you both okay?
Sure, how's Suzuki?
He hurt his leg.
I'll soon be on Route 15.
He's losing speed.
How much further?
Still 2km.
Can he make it?
There's no choice.
Yes, but...
Naomi, heading south, Isarago Hill.
Naomi?
Come on, give me directions!
Take Route 15 to the Takanawa post office then...
Get the envelope from Suzuki!
No sweat!
Something came up but I'll be there by one.
Do your best.
Turn left there for a short-cut.
Sengakuji tunnel?
This car is too high to get through.
I'll pay whatever it takes.
I can't be late.
Here, do it.
Please?
Okay.
Goddamn it.
Give it to me, quick!
Why did you come back?
I'm asking a question!
What does that matter!
Come on, the envelope!
Why?
For Chrissakes!
Why did you come back?
I
I LOVE
I LOVE YOU
I hope it's alright...
Damn.
Oh, no!
What am I going to do?
I'll lose my job!
It's your fault.
I've got the envelope.
Take a left to the Sengakuji tunnel.
Sengakuji Tunnel's blocked.
What?
Who's this?
I repeat...
Sengakuji tunnel's blocked.
Let Naomi know.
Thank you.
She should make a detour.
But then we'll lose.
What shall I do?
Tell me!
There's one more short cut.
You're kidding.
That's impossible.
It's the only way to catch up.
It's our only chance.
Easier said than done.
Get out of the way!
Out of the way!
Come on, come on...
Go, go, go...
Mr. Grey regards being late as very rude.
I'm terribly sorry.
We'll show you around until he comes.
Let us take you to the lounge.
He says he'd rather start the meeting.
Right.
Then to the 5th floor conference room.
He's asking where are your executives?
Then the 8th floor board room.
Hey!
Are you trying to piss me off?
And YOU!
What 's your fucking problem, huh?
Tokyo Express is the winner.
I knew you'd be the one to bring it.
Did we win?
No sweat.
Sure.
We appreciate the business.
Thank you very much.
We did it!
Great!
Ouch...
I shouldn't mention this now but... could we settle out of court?
Okay.
But with one condition...
Let's make a toast!
To our victory!
Cheers!
Hey, what's that?
It's champagne.
So this the famous Krug then?
It costs $500 a bottle.
Let's open all of them!
Stop!
It's too expensive!
CHEERS!
Hey.
What did you say?
I asked you why you came back, remember?
Oh, yes.
What did you say?
I forget.
No, you don't.
Tell me.
Why does it matter?
It's no big deal.
Then tell me.
You don't give up, do you?
Come on, tell me.
Shut up.
There's nothing that you can't do It's too early to call it quits
I'll give it all I got without a second thought
And even if I lose, baby I'm OK anyway
Greengrocer lady, Funky Satchan Cop on the corner
Sorry!
I love this town and I really love people
So, show me your smile and let's get going
Ain't no problem, no problem
It's my show!
No doubt!
Ain't no problem, no problem
It's my show!
No sweat!
Ain't no sweat!
Don't you worry baby, have some faith in me
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Suntan oil Sunburn cream
Get some sunshine for your soul, don't be so soft on your skin
Thunderstorm, heat waves

Doesn't bother me at all
But when she gets upset
We don't know what to do
No email, no cell phone!
No premium gas!
No airplane!
Do they really help you?
I don't think so, From your body and soul 'Hello'
Even though time passes by and everything becomes old school Our vibe last forever
I used to be the Young Lord Yeah!
You still are!
Ain't no problem, no problem
It's my show!
No doubt!
Ain't no problem, no problem
It's my show!
Whether I'm cool or whether I suck I really don't know
I can't keep myself from going wild
That's cool baby, that's what's really cool
I'm moving everyday I'm grooving into tomorrow
If I disappeared, this funky town
Would forget how to dance

Tool Time The Windy City.
Tool Time breaks wind in Chicago.
- l don't know.
- You're still working?
Yeah.
Al was no help, so I sent him home.
I promised Bud I'd have these Chicago Tool Time ideas by Friday.
Feel like pitching' some ideas to me?
- lt's the middle of the night.
- Got it!
A salute to the middle of the night in Chicago.
No.
- Why don't you just come to bed?
- Bed, bed.
Box springs.
Bedding, bedding.
- Tim, you're obsessing.
- Obsessing, obsessing.
Recess.
Recessed lighting.
A salute to recessed lighting in Chicago.
- Buildings.
Recessed lighting.
- You can start again in the morning.
- l'll be up in a minute, OK?
- You've said that for three weeks, and every night, I'm sitting up there all by myself.
I'm sorry. lf it'll make you feel any better, you're not the only one I'm neglecting.
Eddie called from the garage, Harry from the hardware store.
They're upset.
Maybe the three of us should start a support group.
Look, I know that this Chicago Tool Time thing is important to you, but so is our relationship.
I know that.
Can you remember the last time we made love?
- Sunday.
- A month ago.
A month ago Sunday.
It used to be if we went two days, you'd be climbing the walls.
Walls, stucco.
Salute to stucco.
I could do a whole wall thing.
Tim!
Come on.
Every marriage goes through these down times.
Well, I'm wondering when your downtime is gonna be coming back up.
It's both of us. I've been working so hard, you've been at school.
That's no excuse.
I just read this survey.
It said that that some couples, no matter how busy they are, still make love five times a week.
With each other?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm serious.
Five nights a week?
I'm surprised they have the energy for the survey.
I'm saying that we could make more effort.
I made effort the other morning, you weren't interested.
Maybe it had something to do with your approach.
- What was wrong with my approach?
- l believe your exact words were,
"Honey, I've got three minutes.
Let's go."
How much time do you need?
More than three minutes.
Enough time to connect emotionally, feel romantic.
is there any way you can get some of this stuff done before I get there?
So this girl follows you around the whole day?
Even at recess.
Sounds like she's got the hots for you, Mark.
I know.
How do I get rid of her?
Just be yourself.
Mark, if you have any questions about girls, you shouldn't be asking Randy.
- You should ask somebody who knows.
- Right.
Wilson.
(Mark) Wilson?
- Brad...
- What?
- What about a salute to under the...
- No, I didn't like that.
- OK.
What about...?
- No, no.
Hey, Dad.
How are the Tool Times coming?
We got plenty of ideas.
Actually, thousands.
Whole bunch of 'em.
- You got nothing.
- Zilch.
Yeah, but we will, and I'm not leaving here until we get ten good ideas.
Hey, you know, maybe what we need is a young, fresh perspective.
Brad, what would you like to see on Tool Time?
A salute to Heidi.
Um, do you...?
Kids.
- Want something to drink?
- Iced tea.
- Let's get going.
Come on.
- l wanna finish this thing by 1 1 :00 tonight.
- What happens at 1 1 ?
- l got some work to do upstairs.
- What do you gotta do?
- Somethin' with Jill.
- What?
- Use your imagination.
You mean...
Oh!
Have marital relations.
You make it sound so dirty.
Apparently Jill read some survey where there are couples who get romantic five nights a week.
Five nights a week?
is that legal?
Apparently.
Now I gotta find time to be with her five nights a week.
- No, Tim.
- Yes, whether I want to or not.
- Tim.
- Al.
No.
- Jill?
- Yeah.
Yes, that's me, your wife, whether I wanna be or not.
You know, as much as I'd like to stay, I think I'd like to leave even more.
No, no. lt's all right.
I told him about how you thought we should make love five nights a week.
- l never said that.
- You said we should be like those couples.
All I said was that I'd like it if it was more than once a month.
Ilene and I are once-a-weekers.
And tonight's the night.
- This one is surefire!
- Some enthusiasm.
Sell it, man, sell it.
OK.
Our potential audience in Chicago is what?
Half apartment dwellers.
For them, a big issue is what?
- Cockroaches.
- No.
Safety.
Picture this - a Tool Time salute to peepholes.
You gotta do better.
Bud'll be here soon.
All right.
OK, OK.
Chicago apartments.
- Every apartment has what?
- Cockroaches.
Fire escapes.
Fire escapes as urban patios.
Yes, I see ferns, I see bird feeders.
I see every apartment dweller throwing their TV out the window.
- Whoa!
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, boss.
How's it going?
- Tim, good to see ya.
Al.
- Were you a little late this morning?
- Yeah.
But my mother had a problem.
She broke down on the interstate and had to be towed.
- Oh.
Sounds like quite an ordeal.
- Especially since she doesn't have a car.
It's Friday. I bet you got so many ideas, you don't know where to start.
Right, boss.
I don't know where to start.
A lot of people in Chicago are apartment dwellers.
- Al...
- Wait.
No, that's true.
That's exactly why I came up with this.
Chicago apartment dwellers have what?
- Cockroaches?
- No, no!
Fire escapes.
Picture this - fire escapes as urban patios.
- l like it.
- Oh, hey!
That was my idea.
Al... we're a team.
There's no "i" in the word team.
No, but there's a "u" in "you always take the credit."
There's also a "w" in "who cares?" Huh?
Let's go over your ideas so Tim and I can present 'em to the Chicago station manager tomorrow.
- We're doing that today.
- No.
Mike can't make it today.
- l can't make it tomorrow.
- Why not?
I got in a fight with Jill, and I'm taking her to the new Japanese hotel.
Oh, the old save-the-relationship weekend.
We've all had those, yeah.
You can understand why I can't go to a business meeting.
Absolutely.
I'll bring the meeting to you.
- No.
- Yeah.
Hotel bar, 5:00 sharp, you be there.
Oh, this is so beautiful.
I can see why you always wanted to come to this hotel.
Great view.
The...
Where are we supposed to sit?
On the floor.
This is an authentic Japanese bedroom.
Where's the authentic Japanese bed?
Well, I assume it's in the closet.
Yes.
We take these futons out and put them on the floor where we wanna sleep.
Well, we sit on the floor, we sleep on the floor.
I'm afraid to look in the bathroom.
No, don't step up here.
Take your shoes off first.
- You know, we should go get a massage.
- l'm not much for massages.
If I'm getting oiled, I want it done by a licensed mechanic.
Well, maybe you should go away for a weekend with your mechanic.
Way ahead of you.
Chuck and I have a bed and breakfast for Valentine's Day.
If you don't want a massage, we could soak in a hot tub together.
- Now you're talkin'.
- Yes.
A nice, long, leisurely bath.
Then a long, leisurely frolic in the futons till about 5:00 sharp.
5:00 sharp?
What, are you scheduling our frolicking?
No.
That's when all the restaurants open downstairs.
- l wanna pick the right one.
- Oh, this is gonna be so wonderful.
(phone rings) I'll get the hot tub, you get the phone.
(ringing)
(water running)
Hello?
- Hey.
Tim?
- Bud?
Yeah.
Listen, slight change of plans.
Mike wanted to meet early.
Early?
What do you mean, early?
He promised his wife they'd go out for a romantic dinner.
I don't care. I promised my wife we'd play "Hide the Soap in the Hot Tub."
One of you guys are gonna break your promise, and it's not him.
- Now get your butt down here.
- We gotta talk about this, Bud.
- Who was that on the phone?
- The front desk.
They forgot to give us our complimentary kimonos. I'll run down and get 'em.
- Why don't they send 'em up?
- They're very busy.
I'm in a hurry to get mine, 'cause I'm really into this Japanese style thing.
Sayonara. alligator.
Oh!
(both laugh)
- Oh, that...
- lt's true.
Wait.
Tim, come here.
Listen, I want you to meet Mike McKewen.
- Mike McKewen, Tim Taylor.
- Forget the shaking.
Give me a hug.
- l'm not much of a hugging guy.
- The man wants a hug.
Give him a hug.
All right.
Yeah.
Here, come on, sit down.
Tim, your show's got a lot of local flavor.
Thanks.
We work hard to make it feel that way.
- l got a big problem with that.
- Gone.
Over with.
- Don't have to have it.
Done.
- Love this guy.
- Oh, I loved him first.
- You make a lot of references to Detroit, and how is that gonna play in Chicago?
We're sensitive to your concerns, which is why the show will have a more national appeal.
Good to hear it.
What do you say we forget these drinks and talk about this while we're getting a shiatsu?
As much as I like shopping for small yapping dogs... I'm a little pressed for time.
A shiatsu is a massage.
Then I'd much rather shop for a small yapping dog.
Aw, Tim's kidding.
He'd love to go for a massage.
Good!
I've signed my biggest deals in the massage room with nothing but a towel covering my butt.
I hate to think where you keep your pen.
(all laugh)
Excellent.
Come on, you're too funny.
(phone ringing)
- Hello?
- Hi. honey
- Where are you?
- l'm still here in the lobby.
You wouldn't believe the line for these free kimonos.
Well, forget about it.
With what I've got in mind, we don't need kimonos.
(sighs)
(man groans)
What was that?
Uh, that's two guys fighting over the last extra-large.
I'm gonna see if I can't help out, and I'll call you back.
Bye-bye.
Oh, Yoshiko, that is so glorious.
- Wilson?
- Tim?
What are you doing here?
I come here once a month for an herbal facial and an acupressure massage.
- What are you doing here?
- l'm here for a romantic weekend with Jill.
- Oh, ho-ho.
Where is she?
- She's up in the room by herself.
That sounds very romantic.
Well, I, uh...
I kind of got roped into a business meeting, so I made an excuse and slipped down here.
Well, I'm reminded of a Japanese saying:
(speaks Japanese)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What does that mean?
Roughly, "Liar, liar, kimono on fire."
So, Mike, what kind of massage do you prefer?
- Oh, deep tissue.
- Me too.
Yeah, yeah.
All right, deep as you go and as fast as you can get there.
Tim, you ever had one of these massages before?
No.
They're kinda painful if you're not used to it.
Look at the size of the woman.
How much pain can she inflict?
Ow!
Ow!
Oh...
Oh!
Aah!
Tim, these masseuses really get the blood flowing, don't they?
Yeah. I just wish she was a little heavier.
So, Mike, what do you think?
We got ourselves a deal?
We're gettin' there.
What do you think, Tim?
Yeah!
I just wish she'd hurry up.
I think she's putting footprints on my liver.
What do you say we go back to the bar and seal this deal over some sak‚?
- That's a good idea.
Yeah.
- What do you think, Tim?
(screams)
(moans)
Hello?
- Where are you?
- l'm still in the lobby.
I called the front desk, and they don't give away complimentary kimonos.
Well, not anymore.
After that big fight.
You know what they're calling it?
The gunfight at the O.K. Kimono.
Ha-ha.
- (# karaoke)
- Yeah.
Huh?
What?
#...
Lonely Hearts Club Band
# We hope you will enjoy the show
# We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
# Sit back and let the evening go
(music stops)
OK, honey.
I'll be right up.
OK, bye.
OK, guys, let's get it over with.
Let's close this deal.
- Yeah.
- Far as I'm concerned, this deal is closed.
Hey, all right.
Great, great.
Mmm.
I gotta go. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Mike, nice meeting ya.
Hold your horses, cowboy.
We're next up on the karaoke machine.
- Karaoke?
- Yeah, we're singing, Tim.
- l can't sing, Bud.
- Listen, if you can hug, you can sing.
OK, try this one.
# You'll never know how much I really love you
# You'll never know how much I really care
Yeah, that'll work.
Yeah.
- # Listen - # Doo-wah-doo
- # Do you want to know a secret?
- # Doo-wah-doo
- # Do you promise not to tell?
- # Doo-wah-doo
- # Oh, oh, closer - # Doo-wah-doo
# Let me whisper in your ear doo-wah-doo
# Say the words you want to hear # l'm in love with you
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
# Ooh-ooh-ooh (sobs)
(music stops)
- What are you doing?
- l think I'm doing Ringo's part.
We're supposed to be having a romantic weekend, and I come down here and find you singing a love song to Bud.
Well, I was singing to Bud, but I was thinking of you.
Tim, you were supposed to be having a romantic weekend with your wife?
Yes, that was the original idea.
- Mike, this is my wife Jill Taylor.
- Hi. lt's nice to meet you.
Some romantic weekend.
We've spent a total of five minutes together.
Jill, it wasn't Tim's fault.
I pushed him into this so we could close the Chicago deal with Mike.
I'm kinda disappointed in you two guys.
I can't understand why you didn't tell me.
I would've understood.
- You would've?
- The relationship has got to come first.
That's how I keep those home fires burning.
Let me tell you, those home fires are burning five nights a week.
We read about you.
- lt's been a lot of fun tonight.
- lt sure has.
And you know why?
(# karaoke)
Because...
# They say we're young and we don't know
# Won't find out till we grow
# Well, I don't know if all that's true
# 'Cause you've got me, and, baby, I've got you
Good.
# Babe # l got you, babe # l got you, babe
# They say our love won't pay the rent
# Before it's earned, our money's often spent
(Jill) Ain't it the truth?
# l guess that's 'cause we don't have a pot
# At least I'm sure of all the things we got
# Babe # l got you, babe # l got you, babe # l've got flowers in the spring (giggles) # l got you
# To wear my ring
Whoo!
# And when I'm sad
# You're a clown
# And when I get scared
# You're always around
# So let them say your hair's too long # l don't care, with you, I can't go wrong
# Put your little hand in mine
# There ain't no mountain or hill... (laughs)
# Babe # l got you, babe # l got you, babe
(song ends. applause)
Hello?
- Tim?
- Bud?
Listen, slight change of plans.
Mike wanted to meet early.
Early?
What you mean, early?
He promised his wife they'd go out for a romantic dinner.
Yeah?
I promised my wife we'd spend a half-hour finding the soap in the... never mind.
My whole life, Is waiting for something to happen.
Patty?
- No way.
- Come on, this is a killer dress.
This could very well be what gave Andy his heart attack.
It's so easy to listen In on grownups' conversations.
You just act like you're playing some boring game.
- It's so backless.
- Exactly.
Patty, men love backs, okay?
This will drive Graham insane.
You will have an incredible weekend.
No, no.
I just don't think it's me.
God, I wonder why Graham isn't back here yet.
Well, where is he?
He's at another meeting with another potential restaurant investor.
He's with that Hallie Lowenthal person?
- Yes, and shut up.
- I didn't say anything!
I'm not upset because he's with Hallie Lowenthal...
I'm upset because Neil and Marla are going to be here any minute... and he hasn't come home yet.
And I'm not upset.
Okay.
I can't believe Marla is still dating Neil...
I mean, how many years has it been?
Six.
I know, it's like a prison sentence.
How about this?
I got it from that catalog.
It's truly amazing.
I have the power to be Invisible.
Honey, why don't you go get yourself a piece of fruit?
Because Angela's in the kitchen with Rickie, and she kicked me out.
Danielle, you go get yourself a piece of fruit.
I'll be down in a minute to talk to Angela.
- I don't know.
- Come on.
My life Is different people kicking me out of different rooms.
It's just been so long since Graham and I have had any time alone together.
And I know we won't technically be alone... but I'm pretty comfortable with Neil and Marla, well, Marla.
And I just feel like our marriage needs this, you know... like we need this time to reconnect, or something.
Patty, I know exactly what you need.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my.
You actually own these?
No, I rent them.
Well, you said you needed to reconnect.
- Yes or no?
- Yes.
In such a big way.
Danielle, why don't you go help Mom pack?
Hello?
Yes, he's here.
Just a second.
It's Rayanne.
Hey.
It's the Ray-gun.
What's shaking?
- Nothing.
- So, Angela barely said hello.
Look, Rayanne, don't put me in the middle of this, okay?
Hey, I didn't put you there, that's just where you are.
Yeah, I know, I'll try them, I will.
Girls, are you sure you don't want to stay at my house?
Yes.
- Bye.
I'll see you.
- Bye.
What?
Did you kick your sister out of the kitchen?
No.
Mom, she was being impossible.
This is a really big responsibility being here alone all weekend.
Mom, I've been alone with Danielle before.
Yes, and I can't help but recall the time you put her in the dryer.
Mom, that was so long ago!
I can't believe you're still talking about that.
Anyway, she begged me to do it.
Whosever idea it was...
I don't want to come home and find anyone in an appliance.
Angela, you have to be the adult this weekend.
Now you're going to have... to prove to me that you can handle this, all right?
It's just going to be me and Rickie, what could possibly happen?
- Enrique, what do you want for dinner?
- Hold on a second.
Look, I'd better not tie up their line, you know?
What, you're not allowed to talk to me now?
Just try me at Katimsky's later, okay?
Yeah, right, later.
Much.
- Hl, Daddy.
You're late.
- I know.
Hi.
Oh, my God, your new shirt.
I'll be ready in five minutes.
You would not believe what happened.
- Car trouble.
- No, the wagon?
No, actually it was Hallie Lowenthal's car.
I know.
It's infuriating.
She's got this really loud obnoxious car... of course it won't start in the cold, and so I look under the hood.
You looked under Hallie Lowenthal's hood?
Well, I couldn't just leave her there.
You would not believe Hallie Lowenthal's engine.
It is held together by string, literally.
Now, couldn't she call Brad if her car broke down... isn't that what fiancées are for?
Right, well, they broke up.
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.
Are you sure?
I thought I did.
No.
That must be them!
- Hi.
- Hey.
- You're not Marla.
- Danielle!
Hi!
Hey, everybody, this is Cheryl Fleck.
My brother Graham, sister-in-law Patty, and this is Danielle.
- Here, catch, cookie!
- Thanks.
God, Uncle Nell gives the lamest presents on Earth.
Come in, come in.
Well, it's great to meet you.
I've heard so much about both of you.
Yes.
Well, Neil, could you help me with our bags?
- Aren't those your bags over there?
- Just help me a second.
Sure.
I love your foyer.
Excuse me just one minute.
- Where's Marla?
- We broke up again.
- Neil!
- Neil, where is Marla?
We broke up again.
Don't worry.
Cheryl is incredible.
You spend five minutes with her in the car, you're going to love her.
I hear this honk, right... and here's this cute guy in the car next to me rolling down his window.
So I roll down my window, so then he holds up this piece of paper... and he shouts out to me, "Hey, this flew out of your car".
And I'm thinking, "My God, what did I lose?"
And then right before the light turns green... he holds the paper out and I reach my arm out and all these people... are behind us are honking.
But he gives me the piece of paper... so then I pull over to the side of the road and I look at the paper...
- And you know what it says?
- "Hi, I'm Neil.
Call me."
Yes, how did you know that?
How did he know that?
I think I got a couple of doobies in here somewhere.
- Yes or no.
- No.
If you wanted to do something with Rayanne this weekend... it's not like I would take it personally or anything.
- Angela, I want to hang here, okay?
- Okay.
So, does she ask about me?
It is so cool to be hanging with my big sister and her cool friend.
Do we like this?
I know...
Camille forced me to wear it.
It's not me.
I think it's great.
- Really?
- Yes.
I love sex in a different bed.
You know...
I wish that Neil could have just waited until after this weekend was over... to break up with Marla.
Patty, your concern for Marla is touching.
Patty, look.
We're here, we finally have a weekend.
This is our opportunity to be together.
Don't let the fact that this girl is here ruin it for us.
You're right.
Oh, Nell.
Oh, Nell.
Doobies!
Coming.
I'm only here because Katimsky said Rickie spent the night... and Rickie still owes me $6.50 that I really need.
And because this thing Tino's got going?
He's upstairs.
Cool.
So, I'll be home tomorrow night for dinner.
Okay, you, too.
Bye, Mr. Katimsky.
So, I got to get that 6.50 you owe me.
Rayanne, I gave that to you four years ago.
I wouldn't mind spending a few hours here with someone special.
I love sex on a different bed.
I'm sorry, does Angela know you're here?
She knows.
God.
So, you coming out with me tonight?
Rayanne, I told you.
I'm here this weekend.
Cool.
So, does Angela ask about me?
- What's this?
- Rayanne, put it back.
All right, Graham!
This answers a lot of questions about those two.
Rayanne, give them to me.
Graham, Graham, don't hurt me Master!
Wait, maybe it's the other way around.
Graham, that dinner you prepared just wasn't tasty enough, slave boy.
- Patty, I've been bad.
Punish me.
- This is so unfunny.
Where did you put the key?
- What did you do with the key?
- What?
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe this!
Vasquez, calm yourself.
It's got to be around here.
We'll find it.
Looks like I might be staying a little longer than I thought.
No, Camille, everything is going just fine.
I'm not whispering.
I was just wondering if you could go over to the house... and check on the kids for me.
Thanks.
And while you're there, I left those handcuffie things, you know... on the bed, and I feel really weird about the kids finding them.
Thanks.
Got to go.
Bye.
- Ready for breakfast?
- Yes!
- Who was that?
- I was just checking on the kids.
They're fine.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
Look this is what I believe, it is part of who I am... and you have to accept that.
I cannot believe you are saying this.
I mean, I have to tell you... you are clutching onto some very distorted ideas.
- I am entitled to my beliefs.
- No...
Sit.
I mean, you're being a little unrealistic, aren't you?
Calling the '71 Pirates one of the great teams?
They're just...
You know, after Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell... the team got extremely thin.
There has not been a more overrated team.
Over-rated?
Just stab me, somebody please stab me.
Don't tempt me.
So, you know what I think?
Ice skating.
Apparently, there's this really incredible frozen pond...
- That we can hike to.
- I say we play that one by ear.
Well, we only have a limited amount of time up here... so I think that we should really plan what we want to do.
I mean, we should have a really nice, fun day... and if we plan, we can fill it full of all sorts of fun things.
I haven't been ice skating in a while.
- Come on.
- It's freezing out there.
I think it's a cute idea.
She is so cute.
Great.
Come on, Graham, you're so athletic.
You'll be great.
Fine, fine, fine.
- Yes, sure.
Whatever.
- You are such a cutie.
We're going to have so much fun.
You don't have the keys to your own handcuffs?
- They're not exactly mine.
- Right.
I guess they belong to some really perverted guy you know.
Yes, or your parents.
- What?
- I found them right here on the bed.
- They were not.
- Ask Rickie.
Those things do not belong to my parents.
- Danielle, leave!
- No way.
Danielle, I'm serious.
Mom left me in charge.
I'm not leaving.
I live here.
Great.
Wonderful.
There's got to be a key.
Find it.
And I'll explain this to you later.
Like when you're 30.
Angela?
Danielle?
Anybody?
My mom's not home.
Hi.
Hi, we just stopped by to make sure everything was okay...
- With you and Danielle.
- Well, it is.
So, thanks.
Wait, you have got to see this jumpsuit I got.
I know what you're thinking, jumpsuit, barf, but look!
- It's so cute.
- Wait, where are you going?
I left something up in your mom's room so I'm just going to go get it.
- I'll get it for you.
- That's all right.
- No, I want to.
- Why?
Why?
That is so exactly the point.
Why?
Because of respect for elders, which I just feel is totally lost... in today's world.
So, what did you need?
It's not important.
I'll get it myself.
- I have to talk to you.
- About?
Justice.
I cannot believe that you actually run your own company.
Everyday.
I would love to do that someday.
That or have a cappuccino cart.
I'm sure you could do anything you put your mind to.
I mean, you've got this great job, you've got this husband and children.
It must be so satisfying.
Like with me, there's so many paths I could choose.
Every single possibility of life is open to me.
But, you, I mean, your choices have been made.
Your life is totally settled.
It must really be comforting.
Yes, it is.
Okay, it looks like we can book spelunking for the afternoon.
It starts at 3:00, so if we were to get back from ice skating by 1:00... we'd have time to grab a quick bite before we go.
Could you plan my entire life for me?
You're not going to believe this.
This place doesn't serve alcohol.
- None.
- It's really not a big deal, right?
This is my worst nightmare.
Come on, we're adults.
Do we really need alcohol to have a good time?
Yes.
It's Saturday night.
I want to party down.
There's got to be some liquor in town.
Give me the car keys.
No way.
You're not driving my car.
Not after what you did to my Duster.
That was so long ago.
I can't believe you still talk about that.
- No, no.
- Fine.
We'll all go then.
- Yes, it'll be fun.
- Come on!
Is this the way we're going to spend our weekend, hunting for liquor?
Fine, I'll stay here.
I'll rent the skates.
I mean, you'll be back soon, won't you?
Of course.
I mean, how long could it take?
Can I sit on your lap in the car?
The point is, do I have to keep a top that I truly don't like... just because I'm beyond the 30-day exchange policy?
- I mean, is that justice?
- Why are you obsessing over this?
I got to go.
Do I go and tell them I really don't like the top.
Can I have the receipt back?
Or does it just become this thing... that sits in my closet that erodes...
Is this that lavender top that I got you for your birthday?
No.
- If it is, I really don't care.
- No, I like the top.
No, wait!
Wait, please don't go in there!
Angela.
Oh, my.
Are you all right?
Rayanne is not feeling very well.
Water, water, water, water.
Oh, my God, I think she's choking.
Angela, can you breathe?
Can you breathe?
Rayanne's really, it's really...
- She just fainted.
- Not so much fainted as swooned.
So this is that thing that's going around, right?
Is that, that thing?
Angela, can I see you for just a moment, please?
Sure.
Is that the same Rayanne that has the drinking problem?
This has nothing to do with that, no, I promise.
Does your mother know that she's here?
Of course.
Good.
Okay.
Keep your eye on her and if she's not feeling better by tonight... you call me, okay?
Hi, again.
I guess no one has called for me, right?
Not since the last time you asked, no.
Well, maybe we'd better cancel that spelunking reservation.
Yes, I think so.
The tour started an hour ago.
- This is really a great place.
- Thank you.
- Have you been here your whole life?
- Not yet.
Bye.
Okay.
Danielle, here's the thing about the handcuffs.
See, we thought you might be confused... and we don't want you to think that...
See, they're not even actually mom and dad's, okay, they're...
Right, right, they're just for fun, they're like a toy.
- A toy.
- A toy.
Hey, I don't care.
I'm not even interested.
Good.
Thanks.
Now I'm Interested.
Look...
I made a swan.
That town is so weird.
We all got tickets for jaywalking.
Well.
Did you at least get some wine?
- Wine?
- No.
No, but we did manage to scare up some...
Doctor Allen's Ginger-Flavored Brandy.
Is that Graham's sweater that you're wearing?
Oh, it's so comfy and cozy.
Yes, Cheryl got kind of cold.
Why didn't you loan her your jacket?
What, are you kidding?
I was freezing.
You jerk.
Rickie, will you go down and help Sharon and Danielle with lunch?
- I need to talk to Angela alone.
- Sure.
Look, Angela, I know we're not that close right now, but I just...
Look, I don't want to get into this right now, all right?
Get into what?
Some big discussion about what happened between you and Jordan.
Because the truth is that it happened and nothing can change that.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Neither do I.
- So why did you ask Rickie to leave?
- I have to go to the bathroom.
I need you to get me a jar.
I can't believe you.
- What's that?
- It's nothing.
Okay, this is pretty embarrassing.
When Camille brought over that negligee... she also brought over some handcuffs.
Camille Cherski has handcuffs?
- Well, let's see them.
- I didn't actually bring them.
- Should I have?
- No.
No.
I mean, you know...
- It might have been...
- Yes, I guess so...
Camille Cherski?
I'm telling you, those handcuffs do not belong to my parents.
- Of course not.
- Never.
How much more of this am I supposed to take?
Anyone?
- Cherski?
- Pass.
Bachelor number 2, same question.
I hate to say it, but you know who could actually be capable of... figuring this out?
No, no, no.
Forget it.
Oh, my God.
When he walked through the door, part of his arm touched my shoulder.
I thought I would faint, I mean, swoon.
- Gentle.
- Sorry.
This is really simple.
I mean, a child could get her out of this.
All we need is wire shears.
I mean, any dad has them, you know.
I mean, not my dad, but a normal dad, like your dad, probably has them.
He doesn't.
So, fine.
Well, we can just go to the hardware store Monday.
Great, Monday.
Perfect.
I just think this place is beautiful.
You know, I know that we got off to a rocky start today... but I spoke to Warren and he's willing to be flexible about the checkout time.
So, we can have seven full hours of daylight tomorrow to have fun.
That's really bad.
No, I'm an adult.
I'm not going to break the rules.
- I have never met anyone like you.
- Patty is not a big drinker.
- Too mature for us.
- By a lot.
Come on, you make me sound so stuck up, or something.
Fine, give me that hooch.
Honey, you said "hooch" in a sentence.
Hey, that's not so bad.
Cheers.
He was a genius.
I had goose bumps just watching him think.
Maybe we could find a place that sells handcuffs... by the same manufacturer.
Maybe they would use the same key.
Well, there's this place called the Pleasure Center...
- That might have that sort of stuff.
- Cherski, Pleasure Center?
I've passed by it, jeez.
Well, fine.
So, someone has to go.
Hey, I don't even know where the Pleasure Center is.
Don't worry.
I'll show you.
No.
It's all gone.
No problem.
I love you, Cheryl.
Let's just break this puppy open, yes sir.
Honey, honey, maybe you've had enough.
No.
You think that I'm drunk.
Mayday, mayday, play it cool.
How are you all enjoying the dinner this evening?
It's great.
Yummy.
Isn't it yummy?
Yummy.
No, I'm sorry, it's really good.
That means that he hates it.
But I don't want you to feel bad, Warren... because you see, he's a food snob.
And he hates anything that he doesn't fix himself.
You do.
Patty!
No.
Warren is a very sensitive person, and he's my friend.
And we speak all the time now.
As a matter of fact, we spoke today when you left me here, all alone.
Right, Warren?
Well, we pulled that off.
Okay.
That was close.
You won't believe who we ran into near the Pleasure Center.
Kyle.
Kyle.
Oh, God, that feels good.
Kyle, no, I told you.
You have to go.
You can't come in.
Kyle, no.
Down.
Can't I come in to use the bathroom?
Hey, wake up, I got them.
Krakow, we never did it with you on top before.
- Can we just keep this professional?
- You're my knight in shining armor.
Wait a second.
This key is too big.
It won't fit.
Krakow, you're such an idiot.
- Quit moving, will you?
- No, it's too big!
Hi.
Phil, Brian Krakow has Rayanne Graff chained to a bed... and they're all watching.
Krakow, stop, It's too big.
It won't fit.
Wait a second, wait a second.
So, after you broke up with...
- Kirk.
- Kirk.
Why didn't you go back to the one with freckles?
I like freckles.
It all worked out for the best because Neil is so sweet.
You are so sweet.
Yes, wait a second because Neil here has got an old... commitment problem, you know.
I mean, he just doesn't want to step up to the bat.
Hey.
It's Mr. Bed Breakfast Man!
Could I get you folks anything else?
We were just going up to our rooms, actually.
What a wonderful idea for our other patrons.
No, wait a second, I want an ice cream sundae.
Patty, maybe we should call it a night.
- One ice cream sundae.
- Yes.
Yes, okay, what we need to lighten this situation up...
- Is an after-dinner drink.
- Cheers.
Down the hatch, honey.
- No.
- Baby.
I spilled.
No, wait a second, I know... somebody loan me a sweater!
Did you get that?
Did you get it?
This is going to stain.
- Oh, God.
I think I'd better soak it.
- Patty.
Don't.
All right, that's enough!
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you all to go to your rooms!
Go to my room, excuse me, I am an adult!
That is a judgment call, ma'am.
No, no, no, what about my ice cream?
Nobody is getting any ice cream tonight!
Ice cream!
I want ice cream.
Come on, Warren, how about one little scoop?
I thought we were friends, Warren.
Hey, this isn't so bad.
This is fun.
I really admire her.
Wait, come in.
You're awake?
I can't sleep.
Too bored to sleep.
Could you do me a favor?
I could for money.
Girl after my very own heart.
Okay, here's what you do.
You go down to the liquor cabinet.
You give me a bottle.
Anything brown.
I'll give you a dollar.
- Nope.
- Two dollars.
It's wrong to drink.
You have a real miserable side to you, you know that?
My parents say you're a bad influence.
I heard them talking about the things you do.
Why do you do them?
I don't know.
See, okay, when I look at myself, I see everything in slow motion... and I think, "Something has to happen."
Only, it never does.
So I have to make it happen.
- They're brown.
- That they are.
Good morning sunshine.
By the way, we've been asked to leave.
I would just like to apologize for... what happened last night.
And, also, Cheryl, I'd like to say... that I think I didn't give you a fair chance.
To do what?
Why don't the four of us get together when we get back, you know, go out?
Actually, Cheryl and I decided to keep things casual for now.
We didn't decide to keep things casual.
We broke up!
You don't want to see me anymore.
I got out of the shower this morning... and Neil was on the phone with Marla.
I guess it was partly my fault.
I take really short showers.
I'm really having second thoughts about you taking apart my parents' bed.
- Just do it.
- I told you, that's the beauty part.
I don't have to take apart the whole bed, just the headboard.
Look, can I just say... oh, God, how do I put this...
I acted totally like an idiot.
I made a fool of myself.
But you still shouldn't have left me alone all day... while you were on your liquor hunt.
Honey, I had no idea it would take so long.
Anyway, it didn't seem to matter to them.
What about what matters to me?
I mean, there I am, I'm waiting, and I'm waiting, and I'm worrying... and I'm feeling like the minutes are ticking by, and then you tell me... that you're late because you had to look under her hood!
Wait a minute, what are we talking about here?
You know, I have to say, I think it was really fun.
I think we should all do it again sometime.
But only without Neil.
Okay, on three, 1... 2... 3.
Yes, I'm free!
Krakow, you're a genius!
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- You're leaving?
I can still make something out of this weekend.
- Don't you dare leave now.
- Hey, come on, hands off.
My parents will never trust me again.
Come on, now you're crossing the line, girlfriend.
I can't believe you!
You're this curse that's just destroying my life!
You can't just walk out and expect us to clean up after you.
You're like this living, breathing bad luck omen!
Don't mince words!
- Okay.
- I can't take It anymore!
- Hey!
Hey!
- Rayanne, just don't talk!
Mom's going to be home in twenty minutes!
- I can't get it in, hold on.
- Rookie.
- Lower, lower.
- Okay.
- Higher, higher, higher.
- Finger, finger.
Hello?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Rayanne came over.
Great.
- And I did.
- Me, too.
Sorry.
- What are you kids doing up here?
- We were just...
I would really prefer it if you all wouldn't watch TV in my room.
You're really right.
I'm really sorry.
- We were only up here because...
- Angela!
- So, how was your weekend?
- Nothing special.
- Yours?
- Just the usual.
- Angela!
- What, Danielle?
What is it?
I really missed you.
Danielle, sweetheart.
I really missed you, too.
We'll just get out of your way.
- Bye, Angela.
Bye, everyone.
- Bye, see you.
What a weird weekend.
I know.
And we never even had a chance to reconnect.
Oh, my God.
Camille never picked them up!
Patty, wait a second.
Where's the key?
Oh, my God.
- Thanks.
- Have a good weekend.
Can I talk to Rayanne for a minute, alone?
Look, I don't want to get into any big discussion or anything.
Neither do I.
- Then why did you ask me to stay?
- The key?
- I knew you couldn't resist.
- Party pooper.
Weekend from hell.
That was the best weekend of my entire life.
By the way, thanks.
So, what are we doing next weekend?
Danielle, we are not doing anything.
- We could see what Brian is doing.
- Danielle!
- I kind of like Rayanne.
- Danielle!
My whole life, Is waiting for something to happen.
Patty?
- No way.
- Come on, this is a killer dress.
This could very well be what gave Andy his heart attack.
It's so easy to listen In on grownups' conversations.
You just act like you're playing some boring game.
- It's so backless.
- Exactly.
Patty, men love backs, okay?
This will drive Graham insane.
You will have an incredible weekend.
No, no.
I just don't think it's me.
God, I wonder why Graham isn't back here yet.
Well, where is he?
He's at another meeting with another potential restaurant investor.
He's with that Hallie Lowenthal person?
- Yes, and shut up.
- I didn't say anything!
I'm not upset because he's with Hallie Lowenthal...
I'm upset because Neil and Marla are going to be here any minute... and he hasn't come home yet.
And I'm not upset.
Okay.
I can't believe Marla is still dating Neil...
I mean, how many years has it been?
Six.
I know, it's like a prison sentence.
How about this?
I got it from that catalog.
It's truly amazing.
I have the power to be Invisible.
Honey, why don't you go get yourself a piece of fruit?
Because Angela's in the kitchen with Rickie, and she kicked me out.
Danielle, you go get yourself a piece of fruit.
I'll be down in a minute to talk to Angela.
- I don't know.
- Come on.
My life Is different people kicking me out of different rooms.
It's just been so long since Graham and I have had any time alone together.
And I know we won't technically be alone... but I'm pretty comfortable with Neil and Marla, well, Marla.
And I just feel like our marriage needs this, you know... like we need this time to reconnect, or something.
Patty, I know exactly what you need.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my.
You actually own these?
No, I rent them.
Well, you said you needed to reconnect.
- Yes or no?
- Yes.
In such a big way.
Danielle, why don't you go help Mom pack?
Hello?
Yes, he's here.
Just a second.
It's Rayanne.
Hey.
It's the Ray-gun.
What's shaking?
- Nothing.
- So, Angela barely said hello.
Look, Rayanne, don't put me in the middle of this, okay?
Hey, I didn't put you there, that's just where you are.
Yeah, I know, I'll try them, I will.
Girls, are you sure you don't want to stay at my house?
Yes.
- Bye.
I'll see you.
- Bye.
What?
Did you kick your sister out of the kitchen?
No.
Mom, she was being impossible.
This is a really big responsibility being here alone all weekend.
Mom, I've been alone with Danielle before.
Yes, and I can't help but recall the time you put her in the dryer.
Mom, that was so long ago!
I can't believe you're still talking about that.
Anyway, she begged me to do it.
Whosever idea it was...
I don't want to come home and find anyone in an appliance.
Angela, you have to be the adult this weekend.
Now you're going to have... to prove to me that you can handle this, all right?
It's just going to be me and Rickie, what could possibly happen?
- Enrique, what do you want for dinner?
- Hold on a second.
Look, I'd better not tie up their line, you know?
What, you're not allowed to talk to me now?
Just try me at Katimsky's later, okay?
Yeah, right, later.
Much.
- Hl, Daddy.
You're late.
- I know.
Hi.
Oh, my God, your new shirt.
I'll be ready in five minutes.
You would not believe what happened.
- Car trouble.
- No, the wagon?
No, actually it was Hallie Lowenthal's car.
I know.
It's infuriating.
She's got this really loud obnoxious car... of course it won't start in the cold, and so I look under the hood.
You looked under Hallie Lowenthal's hood?
Well, I couldn't just leave her there.
You would not believe Hallie Lowenthal's engine.
It is held together by string, literally.
Now, couldn't she call Brad if her car broke down... isn't that what fiancées are for?
Right, well, they broke up.
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.
Are you sure?
I thought I did.
No.
That must be them!
- Hi.
- Hey.
- You're not Marla.
- Danielle!
Hi!
Hey, everybody, this is Cheryl Fleck.
My brother Graham, sister-in-law Patty, and this is Danielle.
- Here, catch, cookie!
- Thanks.
God, Uncle Nell gives the lamest presents on Earth.
Come in, come in.
Well, it's great to meet you.
I've heard so much about both of you.
Yes.
Well, Neil, could you help me with our bags?
- Aren't those your bags over there?
- Just help me a second.
Sure.
I love your foyer.
Excuse me just one minute.
- Where's Marla?
- We broke up again.
- Neil!
- Neil, where is Marla?
We broke up again.
Don't worry.
Cheryl is incredible.
You spend five minutes with her in the car, you're going to love her.
I hear this honk, right... and here's this cute guy in the car next to me rolling down his window.
So I roll down my window, so then he holds up this piece of paper... and he shouts out to me, "Hey, this flew out of your car".
And I'm thinking, "My God, what did I lose?"
And then right before the light turns green... he holds the paper out and I reach my arm out and all these people... are behind us are honking.
But he gives me the piece of paper... so then I pull over to the side of the road and I look at the paper...
- And you know what it says?
- "Hi, I'm Neil.
Call me."
Yes, how did you know that?
How did he know that?
I think I got a couple of doobies in here somewhere.
- Yes or no.
- No.
If you wanted to do something with Rayanne this weekend... it's not like I would take it personally or anything.
- Angela, I want to hang here, okay?
- Okay.
So, does she ask about me?
It is so cool to be hanging with my big sister and her cool friend.
Do we like this?
I know...
Camille forced me to wear it.
It's not me.
I think it's great.
- Really?
- Yes.
I love sex in a different bed.
You know...
I wish that Neil could have just waited until after this weekend was over... to break up with Marla.
Patty, your concern for Marla is touching.
Patty, look.
We're here, we finally have a weekend.
This is our opportunity to be together.
Don't let the fact that this girl is here ruin it for us.
You're right.
Oh, Nell.
Oh, Nell.
Doobies!
Coming.
I'm only here because Katimsky said Rickie spent the night... and Rickie still owes me $6.50 that I really need.
And because this thing Tino's got going?
He's upstairs.
Cool.
So, I'll be home tomorrow night for dinner.
Okay, you, too.
Bye, Mr. Katimsky.
So, I got to get that 6.50 you owe me.
Rayanne, I gave that to you four years ago.
I wouldn't mind spending a few hours here with someone special.
I love sex on a different bed.
I'm sorry, does Angela know you're here?
She knows.
God.
So, you coming out with me tonight?
Rayanne, I told you.
I'm here this weekend.
Cool.
So, does Angela ask about me?
- What's this?
- Rayanne, put it back.
All right, Graham!
This answers a lot of questions about those two.
Rayanne, give them to me.
Graham, Graham, don't hurt me Master!
Wait, maybe it's the other way around.
Graham, that dinner you prepared just wasn't tasty enough, slave boy.
- Patty, I've been bad.
Punish me.
- This is so unfunny.
Where did you put the key?
- What did you do with the key?
- What?
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe this!
Vasquez, calm yourself.
It's got to be around here.
We'll find it.
Looks like I might be staying a little longer than I thought.
No, Camille, everything is going just fine.
I'm not whispering.
I was just wondering if you could go over to the house... and check on the kids for me.
Thanks.
And while you're there, I left those handcuffie things, you know... on the bed, and I feel really weird about the kids finding them.
Thanks.
Got to go.
Bye.
- Ready for breakfast?
- Yes!
- Who was that?
- I was just checking on the kids.
They're fine.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
Look this is what I believe, it is part of who I am... and you have to accept that.
I cannot believe you are saying this.
I mean, I have to tell you... you are clutching onto some very distorted ideas.
- I am entitled to my beliefs.
- No...
Sit.
I mean, you're being a little unrealistic, aren't you?
Calling the '71 Pirates one of the great teams?
They're just...
You know, after Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell... the team got extremely thin.
There has not been a more overrated team.
Over-rated?
Just stab me, somebody please stab me.
Don't tempt me.
So, you know what I think?
Ice skating.
Apparently, there's this really incredible frozen pond...
- That we can hike to.
- I say we play that one by ear.
Well, we only have a limited amount of time up here... so I think that we should really plan what we want to do.
I mean, we should have a really nice, fun day... and if we plan, we can fill it full of all sorts of fun things.
I haven't been ice skating in a while.
- Come on.
- It's freezing out there.
I think it's a cute idea.
She is so cute.
Great.
Come on, Graham, you're so athletic.
You'll be great.
Fine, fine, fine.
- Yes, sure.
Whatever.
- You are such a cutie.
We're going to have so much fun.
You don't have the keys to your own handcuffs?
- They're not exactly mine.
- Right.
I guess they belong to some really perverted guy you know.
Yes, or your parents.
- What?
- I found them right here on the bed.
- They were not.
- Ask Rickie.
Those things do not belong to my parents.
- Danielle, leave!
- No way.
Danielle, I'm serious.
Mom left me in charge.
I'm not leaving.
I live here.
Great.
Wonderful.
There's got to be a key.
Find it.
And I'll explain this to you later.
Like when you're 30.
Angela?
Danielle?
Anybody?
My mom's not home.
Hi.
Hi, we just stopped by to make sure everything was okay...
- With you and Danielle.
- Well, it is.
So, thanks.
Wait, you have got to see this jumpsuit I got.
I know what you're thinking, jumpsuit, barf, but look!
- It's so cute.
- Wait, where are you going?
I left something up in your mom's room so I'm just going to go get it.
- I'll get it for you.
- That's all right.
- No, I want to.
- Why?
Why?
That is so exactly the point.
Why?
Because of respect for elders, which I just feel is totally lost... in today's world.
So, what did you need?
It's not important.
I'll get it myself.
- I have to talk to you.
- About?
Justice.
I cannot believe that you actually run your own company.
Everyday.
I would love to do that someday.
That or have a cappuccino cart.
I'm sure you could do anything you put your mind to.
I mean, you've got this great job, you've got this husband and children.
It must be so satisfying.
Like with me, there's so many paths I could choose.
Every single possibility of life is open to me.
But, you, I mean, your choices have been made.
Your life is totally settled.
It must really be comforting.
Yes, it is.
Okay, it looks like we can book spelunking for the afternoon.
It starts at 3:00, so if we were to get back from ice skating by 1:00... we'd have time to grab a quick bite before we go.
Could you plan my entire life for me?
You're not going to believe this.
This place doesn't serve alcohol.
- None.
- It's really not a big deal, right?
This is my worst nightmare.
Come on, we're adults.
Do we really need alcohol to have a good time?
Yes.
It's Saturday night.
I want to party down.
There's got to be some liquor in town.
Give me the car keys.
No way.
You're not driving my car.
Not after what you did to my Duster.
That was so long ago.
I can't believe you still talk about that.
- No, no.
- Fine.
We'll all go then.
- Yes, it'll be fun.
- Come on!
Is this the way we're going to spend our weekend, hunting for liquor?
Fine, I'll stay here.
I'll rent the skates.
I mean, you'll be back soon, won't you?
Of course.
I mean, how long could it take?
Can I sit on your lap in the car?
The point is, do I have to keep a top that I truly don't like... just because I'm beyond the 30-day exchange policy?
- I mean, is that justice?
- Why are you obsessing over this?
I got to go.
Do I go and tell them I really don't like the top.
Can I have the receipt back?
Or does it just become this thing... that sits in my closet that erodes...
Is this that lavender top that I got you for your birthday?
No.
- If it is, I really don't care.
- No, I like the top.
No, wait!
Wait, please don't go in there!
Angela.
Oh, my.
Are you all right?
Rayanne is not feeling very well.
Water, water, water, water.
Oh, my God, I think she's choking.
Angela, can you breathe?
Can you breathe?
Rayanne's really, it's really...
- She just fainted.
- Not so much fainted as swooned.
So this is that thing that's going around, right?
Is that, that thing?
Angela, can I see you for just a moment, please?
Sure.
Is that the same Rayanne that has the drinking problem?
This has nothing to do with that, no, I promise.
Does your mother know that she's here?
Of course.
Good.
Okay.
Keep your eye on her and if she's not feeling better by tonight... you call me, okay?
Hi, again.
I guess no one has called for me, right?
Not since the last time you asked, no.
Well, maybe we'd better cancel that spelunking reservation.
Yes, I think so.
The tour started an hour ago.
- This is really a great place.
- Thank you.
- Have you been here your whole life?
- Not yet.
Bye.
Okay.
Danielle, here's the thing about the handcuffs.
See, we thought you might be confused... and we don't want you to think that...
See, they're not even actually mom and dad's, okay, they're...
Right, right, they're just for fun, they're like a toy.
- A toy.
- A toy.
Hey, I don't care.
I'm not even interested.
Good.
Thanks.
Now I'm Interested.
Look...
I made a swan.
That town is so weird.
We all got tickets for jaywalking.
Well.
Did you at least get some wine?
- Wine?
- No.
No, but we did manage to scare up some...
Doctor Allen's Ginger-Flavored Brandy.
Is that Graham's sweater that you're wearing?
Oh, it's so comfy and cozy.
Yes, Cheryl got kind of cold.
Why didn't you loan her your jacket?
What, are you kidding?
I was freezing.
You jerk.
Rickie, will you go down and help Sharon and Danielle with lunch?
- I need to talk to Angela alone.
- Sure.
Look, Angela, I know we're not that close right now, but I just...
Look, I don't want to get into this right now, all right?
Get into what?
Some big discussion about what happened between you and Jordan.
Because the truth is that it happened and nothing can change that.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Neither do I.
- So why did you ask Rickie to leave?
- I have to go to the bathroom.
I need you to get me a jar.
I can't believe you.
- What's that?
- It's nothing.
Okay, this is pretty embarrassing.
When Camille brought over that negligee... she also brought over some handcuffs.
Camille Cherski has handcuffs?
- Well, let's see them.
- I didn't actually bring them.
- Should I have?
- No.
No.
I mean, you know...
- It might have been...
- Yes, I guess so...
Camille Cherski?
I'm telling you, those handcuffs do not belong to my parents.
- Of course not.
- Never.
How much more of this am I supposed to take?
Anyone?
- Cherski?
- Pass.
Bachelor number 2, same question.
I hate to say it, but you know who could actually be capable of... figuring this out?
No, no, no.
Forget it.
Oh, my God.
When he walked through the door, part of his arm touched my shoulder.
I thought I would faint, I mean, swoon.
- Gentle.
- Sorry.
This is really simple.
I mean, a child could get her out of this.
All we need is wire shears.
I mean, any dad has them, you know.
I mean, not my dad, but a normal dad, like your dad, probably has them.
He doesn't.
So, fine.
Well, we can just go to the hardware store Monday.
Great, Monday.
Perfect.
I just think this place is beautiful.
You know, I know that we got off to a rocky start today... but I spoke to Warren and he's willing to be flexible about the checkout time.
So, we can have seven full hours of daylight tomorrow to have fun.
That's really bad.
No, I'm an adult.
I'm not going to break the rules.
- I have never met anyone like you.
- Patty is not a big drinker.
- Too mature for us.
- By a lot.
Come on, you make me sound so stuck up, or something.
Fine, give me that hooch.
Honey, you said "hooch" in a sentence.
Hey, that's not so bad.
Cheers.
He was a genius.
I had goose bumps just watching him think.
Maybe we could find a place that sells handcuffs... by the same manufacturer.
Maybe they would use the same key.
Well, there's this place called the Pleasure Center...
- That might have that sort of stuff.
- Cherski, Pleasure Center?
I've passed by it, jeez.
Well, fine.
So, someone has to go.
Hey, I don't even know where the Pleasure Center is.
Don't worry.
I'll show you.
No.
It's all gone.
No problem.
I love you, Cheryl.
Let's just break this puppy open, yes sir.
Honey, honey, maybe you've had enough.
No.
You think that I'm drunk.
Mayday, mayday, play it cool.
How are you all enjoying the dinner this evening?
It's great.
Yummy.
Isn't it yummy?
Yummy.
No, I'm sorry, it's really good.
That means that he hates it.
But I don't want you to feel bad, Warren... because you see, he's a food snob.
And he hates anything that he doesn't fix himself.
You do.
Patty!
No.
Warren is a very sensitive person, and he's my friend.
And we speak all the time now.
As a matter of fact, we spoke today when you left me here, all alone.
Right, Warren?
Well, we pulled that off.
Okay.
That was close.
You won't believe who we ran into near the Pleasure Center.
Kyle.
Kyle.
Oh, God, that feels good.
Kyle, no, I told you.
You have to go.
You can't come in.
Kyle, no.
Down.
Can't I come in to use the bathroom?
Hey, wake up, I got them.
Krakow, we never did it with you on top before.
- Can we just keep this professional?
- You're my knight in shining armor.
Wait a second.
This key is too big.
It won't fit.
Krakow, you're such an idiot.
- Quit moving, will you?
- No, it's too big!
Hi.
Phil, Brian Krakow has Rayanne Graff chained to a bed... and they're all watching.
Krakow, stop, It's too big.
It won't fit.
Wait a second, wait a second.
So, after you broke up with...
- Kirk.
- Kirk.
Why didn't you go back to the one with freckles?
I like freckles.
It all worked out for the best because Neil is so sweet.
You are so sweet.
Yes, wait a second because Neil here has got an old... commitment problem, you know.
I mean, he just doesn't want to step up to the bat.
Hey.
It's Mr. Bed Breakfast Man!
Could I get you folks anything else?
We were just going up to our rooms, actually.
What a wonderful idea for our other patrons.
No, wait a second, I want an ice cream sundae.
Patty, maybe we should call it a night.
- One ice cream sundae.
- Yes.
Yes, okay, what we need to lighten this situation up...
- Is an after-dinner drink.
- Cheers.
Down the hatch, honey.
- No.
- Baby.
I spilled.
No, wait a second, I know... somebody loan me a sweater!
Did you get that?
Did you get it?
This is going to stain.
- Oh, God.
I think I'd better soak it.
- Patty.
Don't.
All right, that's enough!
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you all to go to your rooms!
Go to my room, excuse me, I am an adult!
That is a judgment call, ma'am.
No, no, no, what about my ice cream?
Nobody is getting any ice cream tonight!
Ice cream!
I want ice cream.
Come on, Warren, how about one little scoop?
I thought we were friends, Warren.
Hey, this isn't so bad.
This is fun.
I really admire her.
Wait, come in.
You're awake?
I can't sleep.
Too bored to sleep.
Could you do me a favor?
I could for money.
Girl after my very own heart.
Okay, here's what you do.
You go down to the liquor cabinet.
You give me a bottle.
Anything brown.
I'll give you a dollar.
- Nope.
- Two dollars.
It's wrong to drink.
You have a real miserable side to you, you know that?
My parents say you're a bad influence.
I heard them talking about the things you do.
Why do you do them?
I don't know.
See, okay, when I look at myself, I see everything in slow motion... and I think, "Something has to happen."
Only, it never does.
So I have to make it happen.
- They're brown.
- That they are.
Good morning sunshine.
By the way, we've been asked to leave.
I would just like to apologize for... what happened last night.
And, also, Cheryl, I'd like to say... that I think I didn't give you a fair chance.
To do what?
Why don't the four of us get together when we get back, you know, go out?
Actually, Cheryl and I decided to keep things casual for now.
We didn't decide to keep things casual.
We broke up!
You don't want to see me anymore.
I got out of the shower this morning... and Neil was on the phone with Marla.
I guess it was partly my fault.
I take really short showers.
I'm really having second thoughts about you taking apart my parents' bed.
- Just do it.
- I told you, that's the beauty part.
I don't have to take apart the whole bed, just the headboard.
Look, can I just say... oh, God, how do I put this...
I acted totally like an idiot.
I made a fool of myself.
But you still shouldn't have left me alone all day... while you were on your liquor hunt.
Honey, I had no idea it would take so long.
Anyway, it didn't seem to matter to them.
What about what matters to me?
I mean, there I am, I'm waiting, and I'm waiting, and I'm worrying... and I'm feeling like the minutes are ticking by, and then you tell me... that you're late because you had to look under her hood!
Wait a minute, what are we talking about here?
You know, I have to say, I think it was really fun.
I think we should all do it again sometime.
But only without Neil.
Okay, on three, 1... 2... 3.
Yes, I'm free!
Krakow, you're a genius!
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- You're leaving?
I can still make something out of this weekend.
- Don't you dare leave now.
- Hey, come on, hands off.
My parents will never trust me again.
Come on, now you're crossing the line, girlfriend.
I can't believe you!
You're this curse that's just destroying my life!
You can't just walk out and expect us to clean up after you.
You're like this living, breathing bad luck omen!
Don't mince words!
- Okay.
- I can't take It anymore!
- Hey!
Hey!
- Rayanne, just don't talk!
Mom's going to be home in twenty minutes!
- I can't get it in, hold on.
- Rookie.
- Lower, lower.
- Okay.
- Higher, higher, higher.
- Finger, finger.
Hello?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Rayanne came over.
Great.
- And I did.
- Me, too.
Sorry.
- What are you kids doing up here?
- We were just...
I would really prefer it if you all wouldn't watch TV in my room.
You're really right.
I'm really sorry.
- We were only up here because...
- Angela!
- So, how was your weekend?
- Nothing special.
- Yours?
- Just the usual.
- Angela!
- What, Danielle?
What is it?
I really missed you.
Danielle, sweetheart.
I really missed you, too.
We'll just get out of your way.
- Bye, Angela.
Bye, everyone.
- Bye, see you.
What a weird weekend.
I know.
And we never even had a chance to reconnect.
Oh, my God.
Camille never picked them up!
Patty, wait a second.
Where's the key?
Oh, my God.
- Thanks.
- Have a good weekend.
Can I talk to Rayanne for a minute, alone?
Look, I don't want to get into any big discussion or anything.
Neither do I.
- Then why did you ask me to stay?
- The key?
- I knew you couldn't resist.
- Party pooper.
Weekend from hell.
That was the best weekend of my entire life.
By the way, thanks.
So, what are we doing next weekend?
Danielle, we are not doing anything.
- We could see what Brian is doing.
- Danielle!
- I kind of like Rayanne.
- Danielle!
Ikuo, come help us
Oh, let him play
Where on earth is the landlord?
Dad'll be mad, let's go home!
Let's go home
I want to die at home...
So I'm going back to Shikoku
You can't die yet!
Anyway, you can only get to Shikoku on the ferry, Grandma
And you don't have any money
Grandma wants to die at home I'm going back to Shikoku
Time to come in, Takeshi
Any luck?
They just said, "Not again"
No sign of her?
So far, no calls reporting missing grandmas
At least she can't freeze to death
We'll wait one more night
I hope she's OK...
It's hardly the first time No big deal
But what if she never comes back?
Don't say that It's not your fault
Someone'll bring her back, always do... right?
Lku-chan
lku-chan
- Honey...
- Yeah?
I had that dream again
I keep on having it
Wonder why
I'm not your grandma's reincarnation
Go back to sleep
Keep dreaming Maybe she'll come back...
Maybe...
If only I could've kept her from going then...
How far did you go?
The baseball stadium Better to steal from the rich...
You really stole this?
I said I would
Maybe whoever stole yours had been robbed, too
Yup, when robbed, rob back
Don't let this little taste make you a real thief
You nut...
The bathhouse was so crowded
I bought you some paint
Did Yuichi cry?
Not one peep
You sure?
What were you up to?
Listening to the neighbor's radio
It's so loud Shall I ask him to turn it down?
Don't bother The old man's hearing's gone
We get to listen along
You haven't changed
What is?
You haven't changed at all
What's that mean?
You're the same as when you were a kid
How the same?
I don't know, you're just the same
You're impossible
He's enjoying himself
What's on your mind?
Tired from your walk to the stadium?
You're out of it
What's that mean?
The trucking company we use hired a sumo wrestler
Really?
A sumo wrestler?
An ex-sumo wrestler Had to quit 'cause he was lousy
Now he's learning to drive a truck
Still hasn't cut off his topknot A guy in his 30s, taking orders from 18 year-olds
I don't know why he keeps that topknot...
Who knows...
Something about that topknot kind of depresses me
But lku-chan...
you don't have a topknot
And your 30s are a long way off
Got a point
Hey, a cop...
Just kidding...
Tanaka from the stadium...
Don't scare me
I'm taking this
Unusual to see you out together
We must reek
The minute you came in
Let me guess - okonomiyaki...
Got the neighbor to look after Yuichi
You've got seaweed on your lip
Just kidding
Don't let the baby cramp your love life
You absorbing this wisdom?
He knows
No, I had to drag him away from work
Ambushed him?
I was watching him for a long time and he didn't even notice
How could I know?
I would have
Seems like you're getting along fine
Honey...
Is my face weird?
What's that about?
Did someone say so?
Of course not
I was looking in the mirror in the café bathroom, and my freckles started to bother me
Looking at my freckles made me think my whole face was weird
So that's why you were in there so long
Remember, a long time ago you said,
"Bet you've got a lot more freckles waiting to sprout"
I kept staring in the mirror, wondering if I'd get more freckles
I really said that?
You really did
Getting tired?
Trade places?
I'm happy right here
You're back early
The weather's so unpredictable
I got you some tangerines
Thanks Just a minute
Was he a good boy?
A real good boy
Maybe he likes the hum of the sewing machine
He's never like that with me
He takes after his father
You really think so?
Especially around the eyes
He'll be a handsome one
You think?
Yes you will, right, Yuichi?
Ono Tailoring - Gentleman's Clothing
What are you doing here?
Just parking the bike I was nearby
They're predicting rain
Stick around, stranger
Maybe next time Just grabbing the umbrella
I'll walk you down
You're a nut...
But I want to
Comb your hair, it's a mess
Is your husband home?
He's not back yet
We found a man who'd been hit by a train
It may be your husband
We found a torn envelope stuck to his pants
It was from the Yamaoka Dye Factory
Your husband is the only one of their employees we haven't accounted for
I've brought his wife
Was this his?
Where is my husband?
You'll never recognize him
We haven't established definitively that it is your husband
It happened in between stations on the Hanshin Line
According to the engineer, he was walking along the tracks, going the same way as the train
There's a gentle curve there, and by the time he noticed him, it was too late
Never reacted to the whistle or the screeching brakes, just kept right on going...
Yumiko
Ono san's worried
She says you stare off into space, while your baby howls
She's worried you might try to kill yourself
She keeps checking on you
Leaving such a little baby...
Why did lkuo have to die?
Well...
That's no answer You sure there weren't any signs?
Usually, having a new baby makes a man eager to work
But killing himself for no reason...
He left you a riddle to solve...
But then, what's the point...
You're all set Nice and clean
Let's tuck you in while you're warm
Thank you
Pull yourself together
Yuichi can't do anything for himself
Right...
That radio sure is loud
Always like that?
He's a lonely old man lkuo always said it was his way of proving he was alive
I'm going to come live with you for a while
Takeshi thought I should, too
We can't expect Ono san to look after you forever
Besides, you've got to consider your future...
Why, Ono san, thank you so much for everything you've done for us
He lives far away, but he's a solid, decent man
I'll be praying things work out
Thank you for bringing them together
Noto's far away, so you won't see them often, but Yuichi's ready for school and he's a good boy
I'm sure he'll get along well with his new father and sister
Thank you so much...
Let's go, now
Grandma, I got some candy
Who gave you that?
The old man next door
Wasn't that nice Did you thank him?
Thank you
Thank you so much...
You take care, now
Good bye, Yuichi
Off you go
Yuichi, bye-bye
I'll go with you to Osaka station
We're fine lt'll only make the goodbyes that much harder
The North-bound Express will be arriving on platform...
I'm so sorry I had a problem at work
I just panicked and really messed up.
I'm sorry
Thank you for coming
He's really got guts sleeping through this
He couldn't sit still on the train...
I'm really sorry, but I have to get right back to work
Is that so?
I'll come home as soon as I can
Take it easy today You can meet our neighbors tomorrow
You already said that That's the third time
I'm going to be your mother, now
OK?
It's really loud, isn't it?
It might take you a while to get used to it
Good morning
Good morning
This is my wife, Yumiko
It's nice to meet you
She's a real beauty
I'll make it formal later and we'II have a drink
It's a tight community so we've got to make the rounds
The old folks get uptight It's easy to offend them
The neighbors are near enough, but my relatives are scattered so it's a real chore
When we do get together it's such a sprawling clan...
That's no fun, either
A real backwater, huh?
The sea's so powerful
Too powerful
It quiets down after the morning market
My new wife
I knew that
I'm Yumiko It's very nice to meet you
At her age, Tomeno san still takes her own boat out
Why didn't you come introduce her to me first?
I did, I did, but you were out
Remember that filthy shack painted an awful color?
Some excuse, you came too late You missed me
We found you here
Pure chance
We stopped in at work, first
He's so damned proud of that new wife, he's dragged her all the way out here
I came all this way so you could see her...
Show off!
Gimme a light
No use falling for me now I'm married with children
You're so full of it
On this special occasion,
I'd like to celebrate with a song
Please clap along with me
These are ready?
Getting warm
It sure is
There's so much land
The ocean's even bigger
Let's go see what's on the other side
I'll go first
Don't, it's dangerous
Whose boat is it?
Nobody's anymore
Then I want it
But where will you keep it?
In the closet
Guess which hand
Wrong
Thank you
It's all sticky
That's the last one
What happened?
I found them wandering around, all worn out so I gave them a lift back
You're so kind
Rhubarb
You picked such a lot How many?
Let's count
When I'm in junior high, I'm going to grow my hair
You'll be even prettier, then
I think your dad's getting silly in the bath
Here it comes
Some salt
No
Salt?
Time for breakfast
I'm going
Off you go Take care
I'm beat
And here I'd imagined relaxing on my day off...
Guess we need that air conditioner
I never thought it'd be so hot here in the summer
Thought there'd be winter year-round?
I was so shocked by the cold at first
Bet you were sorry
"I screwed up, coming to this god-forsaken place," no?
You nut
When I first came back from Osaka, it was really tough
Couldn't believe I'd been born and raised here
I'd sworn never to come back when I left after junior high
Enough, move over
Nope
It's hot Besides, you're heavy
When you're done, I'm heavy, huh?
The kids'll be back
I'll keep an eye out from here Don't worry
Spare me
Nope
Spare me, please
Nope
Spare me...
Please...
Spare me...
It's been six months already
Tamio wanted to come, too, but he's afraid to leave his father alone
Of course he can't
But I'm so happy you brought Tomoko with you
Takeshi must be doing well Renting this big apartment
He married a piano teacher, who's got 30 students She makes more than he does
A dependable wife lmagine children playing lousy piano all day long
You'd go out of your mind
And this?
This is family, it's different
How are things?
Thanks to your excellent match-making
Oh, don't exaggerate, but I really was hoping it would work out
Now and then my husband asks how you're getting along
How's Yuichi doing?
That's wonderful
Hello
What a shock
Thought I'd come back?
I'm here for my brother's wedding
Mom's looking after the kids I'm just wandering
Man, what a surprise
You been well?
That day...
What time was it?
He popped in for a cup of coffee and left
What day?
The day...
he died
He stopped in after work, on his way home
He seemed his usual self, so I was shocked when I heard the next day
He just sat there grinning at my usual jokes
So he got this far home, then...
Said he'd forgotten his wallet, that he'd hurry home and get it
I said, "No rush, anytime"
He said, "Thanks then, I'II owe you 'til tomorrow," and went out smiling
Thinking about it, it seems like a dream
You still haven't changed?
Hurry up and take a bath, before the water cools
Tired?
Yuichi and Tomoko went right to sleep
How was your Mom?
I really should go see her again
I'm going out for crabs You want any?
Three?
You sure three will do?
What are you staring at?
What's wrong?
Close the window, will you?
We'll get icicles in here
A little homesick?
You're not yourself these days
Do you want to go back to Osaka?
No, I don't
I just had a dream...
It woke me up
Guess what I noticed the other day?
What?
You've got spots here
No, I don't have spots there
I'm serious Didn't you know?
Not a clue
They're not spots, they're freckles
How are they different?
They just are
Nonsense...
Tomeno san took her boat out?
I'll check with the fishermen
She'll be fine
She's indestructible She'll swim back if she has to
Nobody knows the sea better than she does
She never gets it wrong
I swear she'll be back
Survived, did you?
She's back!
So you're OK?
We were so worried
Mind your own business
She was on the verge of tears
Just as I promised
Sorry I worried you
You made it back?
That's right
What happened?
We were worried sick
I swam all the way back
Yumiko
Don't trouble yourself
She's indestructible
Can I look at the bicycles?
Sure, but don't go far
Out shopping?
Your first husband's boy...
How old was he?
When his father died?
He was 3 months old
Then he doesn't remember a thing
Maybe that's for the best
It probably is for the best
What...
Still up?
What are you doing up?
Waiting for you Did you drive home?
What else?
Too far to walk...
You shouldn't drive so drunk
Want some water?
Nope
Call me when you're going to be late
I worry about you
What's that?
What did you just hide?
I didn't hide anything
It's just an old bicycle key
I wanted to take off the bell...
You're a liar
You once told me, you had to come back here because of your father
That's right
Tomeno san had a different story
You came back from Osaka to marry your old sweetheart
You were crazy about her
How could you marry me after losing someone that special?
How could you?
What the...
You're a liar A liar...
There, there Let's talk about it tomorrow
It's a scary conversation Save it for tomorrow!
What's wrong?
Your silence spooks me
Do you hate it here?
What are you up to?
Baseball
Baseball's no fun alone
It's not so bad
Where's your mother?
Dunno
You came out here alone?
I just...
I just don't understand...
Why he killed himself...
Why he was walking along the tracks...
Once I start thinking about it...
I can't stop
Why... do you think he did it?
He said the sea calls you
Dad used to go out to sea
He says when he was out alone, he used to see a beautiful light, shimmering in the distance, calling him
I think it can happen to anyone
What fine weather we're having
A wonderful season, indeed
Ikuo, come help us
Oh, let him play
Where on earth is the landlord?
Dad'll be mad, let's go home!
Let's go home
I want to die at home...
So I'm going back to Shikoku
You can't die yet!
Anyway, you can only get to Shikoku on the ferry, Grandma
And you don't have any money
Grandma wants to die at home I'm going back to Shikoku
Time to come in, Takeshi
Any luck?
They just said, "Not again"
No sign of her?
So far, no calls reporting missing grandmas
At least she can't freeze to death
We'll wait one more night
I hope she's OK...
It's hardly the first time No big deal
But what if she never comes back?
Don't say that It's not your fault
Someone'll bring her back, always do... right?
Iku-chan
Iku-chan
- Honey...
- Yeah?
I had that dream again
I keep on having it
Wonder why
I'm not your grandma's reincarnation
Go back to sleep
Keep dreaming Maybe she'll come back...
Maybe...
If only I could've kept her from going then...

A sumo wrestler?
An ex-sumo wrestler Had to quit 'cause he was lousy
Now he's learning to drive a truck
Still hasn't cut off his topknot A guy in his 30s, taking orders from 18 year-olds
I don't know why he keeps that topknot...
Who knows...
Something about that topknot kind of depresses me
But Iku-chan...
you don't have a topknot
And your 30s are a long way off
Got a point
Hey, a cop...
Just kidding...
Tanaka from the stadium...
Don't scare me
I'm taking this
Unusual to see you out together
We must reek
The minute you came in
Let me guess - okonomiyaki...
Got the neighbor to look after Yuichi
You've got seaweed on your lip
Just kidding
Don't let the baby cramp your love life
You absorbing this wisdom?
He knows
No, I had to drag him away from work
Ambushed him?
I was watching him for a long time and he didn't even notice
How could I know?
I would have
Seems like you're getting along fine
Honey...
Is my face weird?
What's that about?
Did someone say so?
Of course not
I was looking in the mirror in the café bathroom, and my freckles started to bother me
Looking at my freckles made me think my whole face was weird
So that's why you were in there so long
Remember, a long time ago you said,
"Bet you've got a lot more freckles waiting to sprout"
I kept staring in the mirror, wondering if I'd get more freckles
I really said that?
You really did
Getting tired?
Trade places?
I'm happy right here
You're back early
The weather's so unpredictable
I got you some tangerines
Thanks Just a minute
Was he a good boy?
A real good boy
Maybe he likes the hum of the sewing machine
He's never like that with me
He takes after his father
You really think so?
Especially around the eyes
He'll be a handsome one
You think?
Yes you will, right, Yuichi?
Ono Tailoring - Gentleman's Clothing
What are you doing here?
Just parking the bike I was nearby
They're predicting rain
Stick around, stranger
Maybe next time Just grabbing the umbrella
I'll walk you down
You're a nut...
But I want to
Comb your hair, it's a mess
Is your husband home?
He's not back yet
We found a man who'd been hit by a train
It may be your husband
We found a torn envelope stuck to his pants
It was from the Yamaoka Dye Factory
Your husband is the only one of their employees we haven't accounted for
I've brought his wife
Was this his?
Where is my husband?
You'll never recognize him
We haven't established definitively that it is your husband
It happened in between stations on the Hanshin Line
According to the engineer, he was walking along the tracks, going the same way as the train
There's a gentle curve there, and by the time he noticed him, it was too late
Never reacted to the whistle or the screeching brakes, just kept right on going...
Yumiko
Ono san's worried
She says you stare off into space, while your baby howls
She's worried you might try to kill yourself
She keeps checking on you
Leaving such a little baby...
Why did Ikuo have to die?
Well...
That's no answer You sure there weren't any signs?
Usually, having a new baby makes a man eager to work
But killing himself for no reason...
He left you a riddle to solve...
But then, what's the point...
You're all set Nice and clean
Let's tuck you in while you're warm
Thank you
Pull yourself together
Yuichi can't do anything for himself
Right...
That radio sure is loud
Always like that?
He's a lonely old man
Ikuo always said it was his way of proving he was alive
I'm going to come live with you for a while
Takeshi thought I should, too
We can't expect Ono san to look after you forever
Besides, you've got to consider your future...
Why, Ono san, thank you so much for everything you've done for us
He lives far away, but he's a solid, decent man
I'll be praying things work out
Thank you for bringing them together
Noto's far away, so you won't see them often, but Yuichi's ready for school and he's a good boy
I'm sure he'll get along well with his new father and sister
Thank you so much...
Let's go, now
Grandma, I got some candy
Who gave you that?
The old man next door
Wasn't that nice Did you thank him?
Thank you
Thank you so much...
You take care, now
Good bye, Yuichi
Off you go
Yuichi, bye-bye
I'll go with you to Osaka station
We're fine
It'll only make the goodbyes that much harder
The North-bound Express will be arriving on platform...
I'm so sorry I had a problem at work
I just panicked and really messed up.
I'm sorry
Thank you for coming
He's really got guts sleeping through this
He couldn't sit still on the train...
I'm really sorry, but I have to get right back to work
Is that so?
I'll come home as soon as I can
Take it easy today You can meet our neighbors tomorrow
You already said that That's the third time
I'm going to be your mother, now
OK?
It's really loud, isn't it?
It might take you a while to get used to it
Good morning
Good morning
This is my wife, Yumiko
It's nice to meet you
She's a real beauty
I'll make it formal later and we'll have a drink
It's a tight community so we've got to make the rounds
The old folks get uptight It's easy to offend them
The neighbors are near enough, but my relatives are scattered so it's a real chore
When we do get together it's such a sprawling clan...
That's no fun, either
A real backwater, huh?
The sea's so powerful
Too powerful
It quiets down after the morning market
My new wife
I knew that
I'm Yumiko It's very nice to meet you
At her age, Tomeno san still takes her own boat out
Why didn't you come introduce her to me first?
I did, I did, but you were out
Remember that filthy shack painted an awful color?
Some excuse, you came too late You missed me
We found you here
Pure chance
We stopped in at work, first
He's so damned proud of that new wife, he's dragged her all the way out here
I came all this way so you could see her...
Show off!
Gimme a light
No use falling for me now I'm married with children
You're so full of it
On this special occasion,
I'd like to celebrate with a song
Please clap along with me
These are ready?
Getting warm
It sure is
There's so much land
The ocean's even bigger
Let's go see what's on the other side
I'll go first
Don't, it's dangerous
Whose boat is it?
Nobody's anymore
Then I want it
But where will you keep it?
In the closet
Guess which hand
Wrong
Thank you
It's all sticky
That's the last one
What happened?
I found them wandering around, all worn out so I gave them a lift back
You're so kind
Rhubarb
You picked such a lot How many?
Let's count
When I'm in junior high, I'm going to grow my hair
You'll be even prettier, then
I think your dad's getting silly in the bath
Here it comes
Some salt
No
Salt?
Time for breakfast
I'm going
Off you go Take care
I'm beat
And here I'd imagined relaxing on my day off...
Guess we need that air conditioner
I never thought it'd be so hot here in the summer
Thought there'd be winter year-round?
I was so shocked by the cold at first
Bet you were sorry
"I screwed up, coming to this god-forsaken place," no?
You nut
When I first came back from Osaka, it was really tough
Couldn't believe I'd been born and raised here
I'd sworn never to come back when I left after junior high
Enough, move over
Nope
It's hot Besides, you're heavy
When you're done, I'm heavy, huh?
The kids'll be back
I'll keep an eye out from here Don't worry
Spare me
Nope
Spare me, please
Nope
Spare me...
Please...
Spare me...
It's been six months already
Tamio wanted to come, too, but he's afraid to leave his father alone
Of course he can't
But I'm so happy you brought Tomoko with you
Takeshi must be doing well Renting this big apartment
He married a piano teacher, who's got 30 students She makes more than he does
A dependable wife imagine children playing lousy piano all day long
You'd go out of your mind
And this?
This is family, it's different
How are things?
Thanks to your excellent match-making
Oh, don't exaggerate, but I really was hoping it would work out
Now and then my husband asks how you're getting along
How's Yuichi doing?
That's wonderful
Hello
What a shock
Thought I'd come back?
I'm here for my brother's wedding
Mom's looking after the kids I'm just wandering
Man, what a surprise
You been well?
That day...
What time was it?
He popped in for a cup of coffee and left
What day?
The day...
he died
He stopped in after work, on his way home
He seemed his usual self, so I was shocked when I heard the next day
He just sat there grinning at my usual jokes
So he got this far home, then...
Said he'd forgotten his wallet, that he'd hurry home and get it
I said, "No rush, anytime"
He said, "Thanks then, I'II owe you 'til tomorrow," and went out smiling
Thinking about it, it seems like a dream
You still haven't changed?
Hurry up and take a bath, before the water cools
Tired?
Yuichi and Tomoko went right to sleep
How was your Mom?
I really should go see her again
I'm going out for crabs You want any?
Three?
You sure three will do?
What are you staring at?
What's wrong?
Close the window, will you?
We'll get icicles in here
A little homesick?
You're not yourself these days
Do you want to go back to Osaka?
No, I don't
I just had a dream...
It woke me up
Guess what I noticed the other day?
What?
You've got spots here
No, I don't have spots there
I'm serious Didn't you know?
Not a clue
They're not spots, they're freckles
How are they different?
They just are
Nonsense...
Tomeno san took her boat out?
I'll check with the fishermen
She'll be fine
She's indestructible She'll swim back if she has to
Nobody knows the sea better than she does
She never gets it wrong
I swear she'll be back
Survived, did you?
She's back!
So you're OK?
We were so worried
Mind your own business
She was on the verge of tears
Just as I promised
Sorry I worried you
You made it back?
That's right
What happened?
We were worried sick
I swam all the way back
Yumiko
Don't trouble yourself
She's indestructible
Can I look at the bicycles?
Sure, but don't go far
Out shopping?
Your first husband's boy...
How old was he?
When his father died?
He was 3 months old
Then he doesn't remember a thing
Maybe that's for the best
It probably is for the best
What...
Still up?
What are you doing up?
Waiting for you Did you drive home?
What else?
Too far to walk...
You shouldn't drive so drunk
Want some water?
Nope
Call me when you're going to be late
I worry about you
What's that?
What did you just hide?
I didn't hide anything
It's just an old bicycle key
I wanted to take off the bell...
You're a liar
You once told me, you had to come back here because of your father
That's right
Tomeno san had a different story
You came back from Osaka to marry your old sweetheart
You were crazy about her
How could you marry me after losing someone that special?
How could you?
What the...
You're a liar A liar...
There, there Let's talk about it tomorrow
It's a scary conversation Save it for tomorrow!
What's wrong?
Your silence spooks me
Do you hate it here?
What are you up to?
Baseball
Baseball's no fun alone
It's not so bad
Where's your mother?
Dunno
You came out here alone?
I just...
I just don't understand...
Why he killed himself...
Why he was walking along the tracks...
Once I start thinking about it...
I can't stop
Why... do you think he did it?
He said the sea calls you
Dad used to go out to sea
He says when he was out alone, he used to see a beautiful light, shimmering in the distance, calling him
I think it can happen to anyone
What fine weather we're having
A wonderful season, indeed
Ikuo, come help us
Oh, let him play
Where on earth is the landlord?
Dad'll be mad, let's go home!
Let's go home
I want to die at home...
So I'm going back to Shikoku
You can't die yet!
Anyway, you can only get to Shikoku on the ferry, Grandma
And you don't have any money
Grandma wants to die at home I'm going back to Shikoku
Time to come in, Takeshi
Any luck?
They just said, "Not again"
No sign of her?
So far, no calls reporting missing grandmas
At least she can't freeze to death
We'll wait one more night
I hope she's OK...
It's hardly the first time No big deal
But what if she never comes back?
Don't say that It's not your fault
Someone'll bring her back, always do... right?
Iku-chan
Iku-chan
- Honey...
- Yeah?
I had that dream again
I keep on having it
Wonder why
I'm not your grandma's reincarnation
Go back to sleep
Keep dreaming Maybe she'll come back...
Maybe...
If only I could've kept her from going then...
How far did you go?
The baseball stadium Better to steal from the rich...
You really stole this?
I said I would
Maybe whoever stole yours had been robbed, too
Yup, when robbed, rob back
Don't let this little taste make you a real thief
You nut...
The bathhouse was so crowded
I bought you some paint
Did Yuichi cry?
Not one peep
You sure?
What were you up to?
Listening to the neighbor's radio
It's so loud Shall I ask him to turn it down?
Don't bother The old man's hearing's gone
We get to listen along
You haven't changed
What is?
You haven't changed at all
What's that mean?
You're the same as when you were a kid
How the same?
I don't know, you're just the same
You're impossible
He's enjoying himself
What's on your mind?
Tired from your walk to the stadium?
You're out of it
What's that mean?
The trucking company we use hired a sumo wrestler
Really?
A sumo wrestler?
An ex-sumo wrestler Had to quit 'cause he was lousy
Now he's learning to drive a truck
Still hasn't cut off his topknot A guy in his 30s, taking orders from 18 year-olds
I don't know why he keeps that topknot...
Who knows...
Something about that topknot kind of depresses me
But Iku-chan...
you don't have a topknot
And your 30s are a long way off
Got a point
Hey, a cop...
Just kidding...
Tanaka from the stadium...
Don't scare me
I'm taking this
Unusual to see you out together
We must reek
The minute you came in
Let me guess - okonomiyaki...
Got the neighbor to look after Yuichi
You've got seaweed on your lip
Just kidding
Don't let the baby cramp your love life
You absorbing this wisdom?
He knows
No, I had to drag him away from work
Ambushed him?

I'm happy right here
You're back early
The weather's so unpredictable

Thanks Just a minute
Was he a good boy?
A real good boy
Maybe he likes the hum of the sewing machine
He's never like that with me
He takes after his father
You really think so?
Especially around the eyes
He'll be a handsome one
You think?
Yes you will, right, Yuichi?

Linda Hoaglund with Judith Aley
You think you're man enough to test my blade ?
Do you ?
Your type are all cowards !
I've met and defeated tens of hundreds of your type !
So, come on.
Make your move.
Or, are you waiting for me to make the first move ?
First mistake ?
Well, that's your first mistake, waiting for my mistake !
'Cause I don't make mistakes !
Let that be a lesson to you.
- Are you finished with my sword ?
- Don't do that !
This is not a plaything.
I said I'd get some wood.
I didn't say how I was going to get it.
You're lucky the tree was unarmed.
- You could've been hurt.
- Maybe I wouldn't if someone...
- would teach me how to use it ?
- No.
You know ?
Doesn't it make more sense that I should learn how to defend myself ?
I think it makes more sense.
Don't confuse defending yourself with using a weapon.
When you pull a sword, you have to be ready to kill.
- You don't think I know that ?
- No...
I don't think you do.
People are too quick to go for their sword.
It should always be the last resort.
I don't want to learn to kill.
I want to learn to survive.
All right.
The rules of survival.
Number one.
If you can run, run.
Number two.
If you can't run...
surrender, and then run.
Number three.
If you're outnumbered, let them fight each other... while you run.
- Number four...
- Wait.
- More running ?
- No.
Four is where you talk your way out of it, and I know you can do that.
It's wisdom before weapons, Gabrielle.
The moment you pick up a sword, you become a target.
And the moment you kill...
The moment you kill...
What ?
Everything changes.
Everything.
What is it ?
- Sweetie...
- Trouble.
Easy pickings.
Is this the 'run' part ?
Not yet, but just be ready.
Nice day, isn't it ?
That depends on you.
What do you want ?
Oh, we're but poor men trying to scrape an existence in this evil world.
Every now and then we ask for a little something from travelers... like your horse, your gold... or any jewelry you might be carrying.
And I think I'll have that fancy sword of yours, too.
Now, all things considered...
I think a surrender would be a good start.
I accept.
Gabrielle, take their weapons.
Atrápenlas !
Getthelittleone !
She's got a sword !
Killher,quick!
I know this sword.
Only one person carries a sword like this.
- You're Xena, aren't you ?
- Do you really wanna find out ?
My reputation is going to soar !
-Runforit!
Come on!
- Let's get out of here !
Very good.
Did you notice the young one ?
She has a fire about her... and yet, she didn't stain herself with blood.
Morpheus'll be pleased.
Yes, she's the one.
She's perfect.
In a time of ancient gods warlords and kings...
A land in turmoil cried out for a hero...
She was Xena... a mighty princess, forged in the heat of battle The power The passion The danger...
Her courage will change the world...
I still can't believe it.
They came right for me when I picked up the sword.
Maybe they thought you were a threat
You're waiting for the right moment to say, 'I told you so', aren't you ?
Nope !
I'm waiting for you to say it for me.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Maybe something like,
'Xena needs my help. ' or,
'I wonder if I could take some of the heat off Xena. '
In both cases, no.
I'm gonna pick up some more salt pork.
I'll meet you back here in a few minutes.
Afternoon.
Is that your friend ?
- Yeah, why ?
- Oh, no reason.
Just strangers in town, is all.
So !
What can I do for you ?
I need a sharpening stone and some oil.
Who do I report a dead highwayman to ?
Dead ?
Your friend didn't kill him, did she ?
No.
Oh.
Well, that's good.
What difference does it make who killed him ?
Hey !
Elkton !
Get outta here !
I know, I'm sorry.
I wouldn't've come... but my horse has lost his halter.
- Out !
Now !
- Please...
I can't guide him very well with just a rope.
I'm warning you, old man...
leave !
And don't come back !
Why don't you just sell the man a halter ?
Because, I don't do business with his kind.
- But I'm not a Mystic anymore !
- A Gryphon can't change its feathers !
Mystic, ex-Mystic, it's all the same !
Go on... out !
I'm no...
Mystic !
Sure, that looked cruel, but... he's one of them.
So, it was a sharpening stone, right ?
No, I've changed my mind.
I need a halter for my horse.
- Hey !
What are you doing here ?
- Aren't you open ?
Well, of course I'm open, young lady, but... what are you doing in town ?
You're supposed to be off by the water's edge until after the Solstice... unless you've got no reason to fear Morpheus.
Morpheus ?
God of dreams ?
Now, why would I fear him ?
Ah !
You must be experienced then.
Yeah !
I mean, I've had experiences.
- Are you always this nosey ?
- I should have known.
Otherwise, why would you be in my shop ?
Looking to replace your arms ?
Lose your weapon of choice in a battle, did you ?
Yeah, right !
Big battle.
You don't look like a fighter.
Sure... that's your strength.
Like the beautiful seed hidden in an eagle's dung.
Nice image...
Ah !
Now, let me see what I can show you.
Ah...
The steel... it's from the Albanian mines of Iskander Beg.
It's the most beautiful sword I've ever seen.
And... oh !
Believe me, I've handled plenty.
but, maybe something more... petite.
Well, let me see what's over here.
Oh, how cute !
It's a breast dagger.
Oh... you mean, it's designed to pierce the breast into the heart of your enemy.
No... not quite.
Oh... a breast dagger.
Yeah, I like it !
Yeah...
Get out of town, Mystic.
I'm no...
Mystic !
It's... it's a halter !
Who did this ?
Who ?
Thank you !
Thank you.
Did you get your sharpening stone ?
No.
What's the matter with you ?
What do you mean ?
I don't know.
You just seem... bigger.
No, I'm not.
It's just this mountain air.
I feel motivated.
You didn't find a sorcerer to enhance your motives, did you ?
No.
Would you get over it ?
Ooh...
Ah !
Wow !
Look at you look at that ?
I wonder what else is in these clothes ?
They're hand-me-downs, you know ?
I know... wisdom before weapons.
I'll keep this for the time being.
Hah !
It's not like your breasts aren't dangerous enough.
That was a jokeYou can laugh.
What's going on ?
Get on the horse.
They took her.
Where are they ?
They're probably at the... fortress of Morpheus by now.
It's the Solstice.
The...
Mystics need a young maiden.
We normally send our young girls away.
- I thought you knew.
- No.
Your eyes practically lit up when you saw us come into town.
What are they going to do to her ?
!
Stop !
By the gods, you're strong !
Every Solstice... the Mystics come down from the mountain and they take a young girl.
We never see them again.
That blind man...
- he was a Mystic.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah... go and see him !
If you dare.
Soon, my Lord Morpheus.
I think you will be pleased with your bride... as soon as she proves herself worthy.
Let me out of here.
Believe me, you are in big trouble !
My child, I understand your confusion.
But take heart.
You are being honored today.
OK...
Keep talking.
You have been selected to be the bride of Morpheus
Bride ?
Morpheus ?
No, you've got the wrong girl... take my word for it.
I'm not the wifely type.
I...
Well, I sleep late, I don't know a lick about housework.
And children ?
I mean, look at these hipbones.
- No way.
- None of that matters to Morpheus.
Really ?
Well, what does matter ?
I've got lots of faults.
You're to go through a series of challenges against worthy opponents.
If you survive, you will become the honored wife of Morpheus.
- If not, you'll have been sacrificed in the name...
- Wait a minute.
Back up to that 'If you survive' part for a moment.
The challenges will not be easy.
And each one will be a fight to the death.
Who's there ?
I'm not as blind as you think I am !
I have senses you can't conceive of !
- Come on !
Speak up !
- I'm not here to harm you.
That voice...
You were in the store today.
You bought me that halter.
I want to know about the Mystics.
They're evil.
A perverted cult that worships the dark brother of the dreams gods.
I know all about them.
I was a Mystic once...
back when the order was good.
But why do you ask ?
And who are you ?
My name is Xena.
They took my friend, and I'm going to get her back.
She's been chosen as Morpheus' bride.
She's going to lose her blood innocence.
Blood innocence ?
Your friend has never killed anyone.
She will go through a series of challenges.
She will be tricked into killing to survive.
As soon as she does that... she will be sacrificed.
You know where this fortress is.
Take me there.
It's no good !
It... it... it's hidden in the mountains, and well protected by an army of warriors.
It would take you months... days... to fight your way in.
By then, your friend will be dead.
Unless... unless you're the one !
In a dream vision,
I saw a warrior who could travel the Dream Passage and defeat Morpheus !
You must be the one !
A woman with a dark past... strong and brave...
I'm the one.
The world of dreams is made of many passages.
It is possible to follow one from one location to another.
Essentially, you bypass the physical world.
What can I expect ?
Everything in the Dreamscape comes from your own mind.
Once in, Morpheus will know everything that you know.
He will use that to try and stop you.
Drink this and lay back.
This is N'Kama oil.
The instant your soul enters the Dream Passage, your body begins to lose its life fluids.
N'Kama oil will give you more time.
How much time is that ?
Just a few hours at best.
You must find the exit door at the other end of the Dream Passage.
Once you pass through it, your body will reunite with your soul.
If not... the body dies.
Until then, I will guard it.
Don't worry...
I'm a gentleman.
This is the fire of dreams !
This is the key.
Morpheus knows what we're up to.
Listen to me carefully, Xena.
He will try to use your own mind against you.
If you can defeat him there, you'll win.
Don't be obvious.
Remember, this is your Dream Passage.
The gods... be with you.
We've been waiting for you, our Queen !
Our brilliant commander !
We've taken another town !
They're all dead, as you wished !
Every one of them !
As you ordered !
No !
I left this behind me !
You can't change who you are !
And you are a warrior.
To be feared and obeyed.
And those that don't... die !
Xena...
Do you know me, Warrior Queen ?
Should I ?
This was my village.
All gone now.
Your people came and wiped it out...
and me... as you commanded.
- Did you know ?
I had a name ?
- I didn't do this.
My name is Mesmer.
- My wife's name...
- I'm sorry.
Sorry ?
Sorry to know my name ?
Oh, that's right.
Your victims were always faceless.
You never knew much about them, did you ?
Or cared.
I am Baruch.
I had two brothers... one fifteen, and the other twenty.
They were killed, too.
Do you wanna know their names ?
No, I left this behind me.
Septim and Valius.
I am Dolas.
My brother and I were the first to die.
His name was Linius.
Stand back !
- We're not crowding you, Xena.
- It's the weight of your conscience.
You can end this, Xena.
You can end it... easily.
Kill us.
You know how.
Take the sword.
Morpheus !
I won't do it !
It's a trick !
You're trying to slow me down !
You're using the past of a Xena long dead !
I'm not her anymore !
The Innocent has a friend who has entered the Dreamscape Passage.
This is Elkton's work.
Find him and you will find her body.
Morpheus wants them both to die.
Go !
No, no !
It's happening too fast !
Morpheus is draining your life quicker than I expected !
You... you must hurry, Xena !
You must hurry !
We must flee !
The first challenge awaits you.
First challenge ?
How many of these challenges are there ?
Enough for our lord, Morpheus, to make an estimation of your worth.
So... if I get through this, then you'll let me go ?
'
By the grace of our lord, Morpheus, of course.
Of course.
What's this for ?
You want to win, don't you ?
Find your way to the other end, Innocent.
There'll be two men trying to stop you.
Stop them first.
If you're outnumbered, let them fight each other.
Very good, Innocent.
I had thought you would have killed... but you didn't.
Rest now.
Morpheus requires a second challenge soon.
They're going to sacrifice me.
They're going to sacrifice me not.
They're going to sacrifice me.
They're not going to sacrifice you.
Wait...
I don't know if you're real or not.
You don't know if I'm real ?
This is my dream.
I'm the only one who is real.
Tell me something about you I don't know.
How's that going to prove anything ?
Morpeus can guess anything I know.
Tell me something about you I don't know.
Very well.
All right.
Nobody but my mother knows this.
I had six toes on my right foot when I was born.
Don't look !
It's gone now !
It must be you.
Yeah, it must be you.
Morpheus would have used something vaguely familiar to me.
My Dreamscape Passage and your dream must be overlapping.
Nice outfit.
Yeah.
Are you all right ?
Listen to me, Gabrielle.
They want you to kill.
And, no matter what, you can't do it.
I thought they wanted me to marry Morpheus.
Morpheus wants you to lose your blood innocence.
Once you do, you'll be sacrificed as his bride.
I...
I've already been through one of their challenges.
And there were two of them.
I did what you said.
They killed each other.
Does that count ?
If it did, you'd be on your honeymoon by now.
OK.
Option A is out.
No killing.
So, let's talk about option B.
What is it ?
I need time.
Use what you know to defend yourself until I can break through the passage into the fortress.
What do I know that's going to keep me alive until you show up ?
- What's the matter ?
- I don't know.
I feel strange.
Talking !
That's what you're good at !
Use your mind, Gabrielle !
I don't suppose you want my breakfast order.
Prepare yourself for the next challenge, Innocent.
This one will not be quite as easy as the first.
You shouldn't fear using a blade to protect yourself.
Morpheus would understand.
I bet he would.
He seems like an understanding kind of god.
What if I just killed you right now ?
Is that what you wish to do ?
It was a hypothetical question.
I don't suppose that y... you'd want to let me sleep a little longer... would you ?
I mean...
I'd hate to show up the blushing bride with circles under my eyes.
Just, seven or eight hours ?
Time is not on your side, Innocent.
I know about your friend in the Dreamscape Passage.
I have warriors looking for her body.
She'll be dead long before she could help you.
Look for wagon tracks.
Manus wants them dead.
This is all the N'Kama oil I have, Xena.
Morpheus, you're not gonna win !
Save yourself, Innocent.
Morpheus wants you to succeed.
I'll bet he does.
I won't be needing this.
Yes, Innocent.
Draw blood.
Use what I know.
Use what I'm good at.
Im not really good at anything except... talking.
Slow down !
Not all at once.
I mean, let's face it...
I'm going to get a bit tired.
So why don't we be fair about this ?
Whichever one of you is the best fighter...
I'll take you on first.
And then the second, and then...
well... the easy pickings.
So, who is it ?
Who's the best ?
You... really ?
Well, I would have thought... yeah... that would have been my guess.
Clever girl.
I guess we know where they place you.
One of you has got to be better than the other.
You're smarter than I gave you credit for, Innocent.
Somehow, you've learned that Morpheus demands you spill blood.
You've had two opportunities.
The next challenge will not have options.
You take the life offered you, or you die.
Surprised to see me again ?
Not really... nothing surprises me anymore.
How about me ?
Termin ?
Even in your weakened state, you can't forget your first.
And I was only the first of many, wasn't I ?
The first notch on your hilt.
Here...
I still have the scar where you slit my throat.
You attacked our village.
Friends of mine... people I grew up with... died under your sword.
You were still an innocent then.
Like Gabrielle.
Soon, she'll be just like you.
She's going to taste blood.
She'll be haunted by all the familiar demons.
- There'll be a first kill to remember.
- Like me.
- And a last kill to try and forget.
- Like me.
Everything you have felt, she will know...
The screams of her murdered will deafen her.
No.
And there's nothing you can do to save her.
Your body in the outside world dies... and you die along with it.
- I can stop you.
- With what ?
This is my dream... my passage...
I control it.
Hold on, Gabrielle !
I'm almost there !
No, no, Xena, you can't leave, yet.
You haven't passed your final test.
Who are you ?
Oh, you know me.
You know me better than any opponent you've ever faced.
This might be your Dreamscape... but you can't control me.
I am you.
You can't go through that door until you have the key.
And you can't go through life trying to deny that I'm the real you.
We were so happy all those years.
Don't you remember ?
Putting fear into all.
Pushing aside those who stood in our way.
Taking what we wanted.
- Ah, those were the days.
- That wasn't me.
That was never who I really was.
Oh.
Well, let me ask you this.
Back then, didn't it feel right ?
Everything we did felt right.
If felt... good
- But it wasn't.
- Oh, how would you know ?
You think this goody-goody act of yours is going to last ?
There's no glory in being a hero...
ask around.
You're weak without me, Xena.
But the fire is still there.
Join me.
All through this Dreamscape Passage, I've had to fight people I've killed before.
And I couldn't bring myself to kill 'em again.
But as I face you...
I realize it can mean only one thing.
Yes... it means what ?
Tell me.
It means I finally get to kill you.
Xena, hurry !
Defend yourself, Innocent.
He'll kill you as soon as you come within reach.
Pick up the sword.
You can't defeat me !
I'm stronger !
I've always been stronger !
You're just a dark reminder of a disease I once had.
If you were that strong, I would never have left you.
But I did.
Ever wonder how the rest of the world sees you ?
Curious ?
Watch as if you had the eyes of your victims.
Hold him !
You men don't know what you're doing !
Don't let Manus get away with this !
Pick up the sword !
No, no, my sister.
You can't leave.
You still haven't found the key.
You take for granted all your gifts and talents... me.
Everything you are today came from me.
Every spark of noble quality that made you a great leader... me.
The strength that made men tremble at your name... it all came from me !
You understand ?
I understand.
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't exist.
Whether I like it or not, you're the key.
You're the key.
There's only one way out of this Dreamscape... you !
You're the key to my nightmares.
And no matter what part of me you think you are...
I control you.
What happened ?
Where is she ?
Yeah !
- Kill her !
Kill them both !
- Xena !
Catch !
I knew you'd come !
Well, I thought you would.
I almost gave up on you.
You have no idea what kind of enemy you've made.
Morpheus will not be denied.
You think he's just going to let you walk out of here ?
- Punching's all right ?
- I'm impressed.
This is the last of it.
- How much do I owe you ?
- Owe me ?
After taking away the fear of the Mystics ?
After... making this valley a safe place to raise a family ?
- Ten per cent off everything.
- You miser !
Don't you dare charge her one single nugget of gold !
Lord Elkton.
Ah, of course not... just kidding.
I hope so.
Unless you want nightmares for the rest of your life.
What do you think ?
Very nice.
I take it you got your old job back.
My old job as Mystic Head Priest and my eyesight ?
Tomorrow, we start the grain festival.
From now on, the only thing we'll sacrifice will be corn... thanks to you.
Glad I could help.
What did you decide to do about Manus ?
Manus ?
That was easy.
We decided to put him into his own Dreamscape Passage... and let his past demons decide his fate.
Xena... you and your friend have saved this valley, these people,me.
From now on... we'll worship the three Dream God brothers... the way they were supposed to be...
with joy, not fear.
Speaking of your friend...
She's waiting for me.
I have to go.
If you're ever in this area...
Well, you know where to come.
I do.
Thanks.
And, um... sweet dreams.
Ready to go ?
I could have killed someone.
I mean...
I was capable of it.
We're all capable of it.
The point is, you didn't cross that line.
But I got close enough to peak over.
And what I saw scared me.
See how calm the surface of the water is.
That was me once.
And then...
The water ripples and churns, that's what I became.
But if we sit here long enough it will go back to being still again.
It will go back to being calm.
But the stone's still under there.
It's now part of the lake.
It might look as it did before, but it's forever changed.
Come on...
let's go.
For your first stab at wisdom, you did all right.
I was just saying that for your benefit.
You didn't think I meant it, did you ?
Not me...
I wasn't fooled.
You think you're man enough to test my blade?
Do you?
Your type are all cowards!
I've met and defeated tens of hundreds of your type.
So come on.
Make your move.
Or are you waiting for me to make the first move?
First mistake?
Well, that's your first mistake...
Waiting for my mistake.
'Cause I don't make mistakes.
Let that be a lesson to you.
-Are you finished with my sword?
-Don't do that!
This is not a plaything.
I said I'd get some wood.
I didn't say how I was going to get it.
You're lucky the tree was unarmed.
-You could've been hurt.
-Maybe I wouldn't if...
-...someone would teach me how to use it.
-No.
You know, doesn't it make more sense that I should learn how to defend myself?
I think it makes more sense.
Don't confuse defending yourself with using a weapon.
When you pull a sword, you have to be ready to kill.
-You don't think I know that?
-No, I don't think you do.
People are too quick to go for their sword.
It should always be the last resort.
I don't want to learn to kill.
I want to learn to survive.
All right.
The rules of survival.
Number one...
If you can run, run.
Number two...
If you can't run, surrender and then run.
Number three...
If you're outnumbered, let them fight each other while you run.
-Number four...
-Wait.
-More running?
-No.
Four is where you talk your way out of it, and I know you can do that.
It's wisdom before weapons, Gabrielle.
The moment you pick up a sword, you become a target.
And the moment you kill...
The moment you kill...
What?
Everything changes.
Everything.
What is it?
-Sweetie...
-Trouble.
Easy pickings.
Is this the "run" part?
Not yet, but just be ready.
Nice day, isn't it?
That depends on you.
What do you want?
We're but poor men trying to scrape an existence in this evil world.
Every now and then we ask for a little something from travelers like your horse, your gold or any jewelry you might be carrying.
And I think I'll have that fancy sword of yours too.
Now, all things considered I think a surrender would be a good start.
I accept.
Gabrielle, take their weapons.
Get them!
-Get the little one!
-She's got a sword!
Kill her, quick!
I know this sword.
Only one person carries a sword like this.
-You're Xena, aren't you?
-Do you really wanna find out?
My reputation is going to soar!
-Run!
Come on!
-Let's get out of here!
Very good.
Did you notice the young one?
She has a fire about her and yet, she didn't stain herself with blood.
Morpheus'll be pleased.
Yes, she's the one.
She's perfect.
In the time of ancient gods..., warlords and kings, a land in turmoil cried out for a hero.
She was Xena.
A mighty princess forged in the heat of battle.
The power.
The passion.
The danger.
Her courage will change the world.
XENA
- WARRIOR PRINCESS
I still can't believe it.
They came right for me when I picked up the sword.
Maybe they thought you were a threat.
You're waiting for the right moment to say "I told you", aren't you?
Nope.
I'm waiting for you to say it for me.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Maybe something like "Xena needs my help" or "I wonder if I could take some of the heat off Xena."
In both cases, no.
I'm gonna pick up some more salt pork.
I'll meet you back here in a few minutes.
Afternoon.
Is that your friend?
-Yeah, why?
-No reason.
Just strangers in town, is all.
So, what can I do for you?
I need a sharpening stone and some oil.
Who do I report a dead highwayman to?
Dead?
Your friend didn't kill him, did she?
No.
Well, that's good.
What difference does it make who killed him?
Hey!
Elkton, get outta here!
I know.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't've come but my horse has lost his halter.
-Out!
Now!
-Please...
I can't guide him very well with just a rope.
I'm warning you, old man!
Leave, and don't come back!
Why don't you just sell the man a halter?
Because I don't do business with his kind.
-But I'm not a mystic anymore!
-A gryphon can't change its feathers.
Mystic, ex-mystic, it's all the same!
Go on, out!
I'm no mystic.
Sure that looked cruel, but he's one of them.
So...
It was a sharpening stone, right?
No, I've changed my mind.
I need a halter for my horse.
-What are you doing here?
-Aren't you open?
Well, of course I'm open, young lady, but What are you doing in town?
You're supposed to be off by the water's edge until after the Solstice.
Unless you've got no reason to fear Morpheus.
Morpheus?
God of dreams?
Now why would I fear him?
You must be experienced, then.
Yeah!
I mean, I've had experiences.
-Are you always this nosey?
-I should have known...
Otherwise, why would you be in my shop?
Looking to replace your arms?
Lose your weapon of choice in a battle, did you?
Yeah, right!
Big battle!
You don't look like a fighter.
Sure, that's your strength.
Like the beautiful seed hidden in an eagle's dung.
Nice image...
Now let me see what I can show you.
The steel...
It's from the albanian mines of Iskander Beg.
It's the most beautiful sword I've ever seen.
Oh, believe me, I've handled plenty.
But maybe something more... petite.
Well, let me see what's over here.
Oh, how cute.
It's a breast dagger.
You mean it's designed to pierce the breast into the heart of your enemy.
No, not quite.
Ah, a breast dagger.
Yeah, I like it.
Yeah...
Yeah.
Get out of town, mystic.
It's a halter!
Who did this?
Who?
Thank you!
Thank you.
Did you get your sharpening stone?
No.
What's the matter with you?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
You just seem... bigger.
No, I'm not.
It's just this mountain air.
I feel motivated.
You didn't find a sorcerer to enhance your motives, did you?
No.
Would you get over it?
Look at you look at that!
I wonder what else is in these clothes.
They're hand-me-downs, you know?
I know.
Wisdom before weapons.
I'll keep this for the time being.
Hah!
It's not like your breasts aren't dangerous enough.
That was a joke.
You can laugh.
What's going on?
Get on the horse.
Gabrielle?
Gabrielle!
They took her.
Where are they?
They're probably at the fortress of Morpheus by now.
It's the Solstice.
The mystics need a young maiden.
We normally send our young girls away.
-I thought you knew.
-No.
Your eyes practically lit up when you saw us come into town.
What are they going to do to her?
Stop!
By the gods, you're strong!
Every Solstice, the mystics come down from the mountain and they take a young girl.
We never see them again.
That blind man...
-...
He was a mystic.
-Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Go and see him.
If you dare.
Soon, my lord Morpheus.
I think you will be pleased with your bride as soon as she proves herself worthy.
Let me out of here.
Believe me.
You are in big trouble.
My child, I understand your confusion.
But take heart.
You are being honored today.
Ok.
Keep talking.
You have been selected to be the bride of Morpheus.
Bride?
Morpheus?
No, you've got the wrong girl.
Take my word for it.
I'm not the wifely type.
Well, I sleep late, I don't know a lick about housework.
And children?
I mean, look at these hipbones.
-No way.
-None of that matters to Morpheus.
Really?
Well, what does matter?
I've got lots of faults.
You're to go through a series of challenges against worthy opponents.
If you survive, you will become the honored wife of Morpheus.
-If not, you'll have been sacrificed in the name...
-Wait a minute.
Back up to that "if you survive" part for a moment...
The challenges will not be easy.
And each one will be a fight to the death.
Who's there?
I'm not as blind as you think I am.
I have senses you can't conceive of!
-Come on, speak up!
-I'm not here to harm you.
That voice...
You were in the store today.
You bought me that halter.
I want to know about the mystics.
They're evil.
A perverted cult that worships the dark brother of the dreams gods.
I know all about them.
I was a mystic once, back when the order was good.
But why do you ask?
And who are you?
My name is Xena.
They took my friend, and I'm going to get her back.
She's been chose as Morpheus' bride.
She's going to lose her blood innocence.
Blood innocence?
Your friend has never killed anyone.
She will go through a series of challenges.
She will be tricked into killing to survive.
As soon as she does that, she will be sacrificed.
You know where this fortress is.
Take me there.
It's no good.
It's hidden in the mountains and well protected by an army of warriors.
It would take you months..., ...days... to fight your way in.
By then your friend will be dead.
Unless...
Unless you're the one.
In a dream vision I saw a warrior who could travel the dream passage and defeat Morpheus.
You must be the one.
A woman with a dark past.
Strong and brave.
I'm the one.
The world of dreams is made of many passages.
It is possible to follow one from one location to another.
Essentially, you bypass the physical world.
What can I expect?
Everything in the dreamscape comes from your own mind.
Once in, Morpheus will know everything that you know.
He will use that to try and stop you.
Drink this and lay back.
This is N'Kama oil.
The instant your soul enters the dream passage your body begins to lose its life fluids.
N'Kama oil will give you more time.
How much time is that?
Just a few hours at best.
You must find the exit door at the other end of the dream passage.
Once you pass through it, your body will reunite with your soul.
If not the body dies.
Until then, I will guard it.
Don't worry...
I'm a gentleman.
This is the fire of dreams!
This is the key.
Morpheus knows what we're up to.
Listen to me carefully, Xena.
He will try to use your own mind against you.
If you can defeat him there, you'll win.
Don't be obvious.
Remember, this is your dream passage.
The gods be with you.
Xena!
Xena!
Xena!
Xena!
We've been waiting for you, our queen.
Our brilliant commander!
We've taken another town!
They're all dead, as you wished!
Every one of them!
No!
I left this behind me!
You can't change who you are!
And you are a warrior.
To be feared and obeyed.
And those that don't die!
Xena!
Do you know me, Warrior Queen?
Should I?
This was my village.
All gone now.
Your people came and wiped it out...
And me, as you commanded.
-Did you know I had a name?
-I didn't do this.
My name is Mesmer.
-My wife's name...
-I'm sorry.
Sorry?
Sorry to know my name?
Oh, that's right.
Your victims were always faceless.
You never knew much about them, did you?
Or cared...
I am Baruch.
I had two brothers, one fifteen and the other twenty.
They were killed too.
Do you wanna know their names?
No, I left this behind me.
Septim and Valius.
I am Dolas.
My brother and I were the first to die.
His name was Linius.
Stand back!
-We're not crowding you, Xena.
-It's the weight of your conscience.
You can end this, Xena.
You can end it... easily.
Kill us.
You know how.
Take the sword.
Septim...
Valius...
Septim...
Morpheus!
I won't do it!
It's a trick!
You're trying to slow me down!
You're using the past of a Xena long dead!
I'm not her anymore!
The innocent has a friend who has entered the dreamscape passage.
This is Elkton's work.
Find him and you will find her body.
Morpheus wants them both to die.
Go!
No, no!
It's happening too fast!
Morpheus is draining your life quicker than I expected.
You you must hurry, Xena!
You must hurry!
We must flee!
The first challenge awaits you.
First challenge?
How many of these challenges are there?
Enough for our lord, Morpheus, to make an estimation of your worth.
So, if I get through this, then you'll let me go?
By the grace of our lord, Morpheus, of course.
"Of course"...
What's this for?
You want to win, don't you?
Find your way to the other end, innocent.
There'll be two men trying to stop you.
Stop them first.
If you're outnumbered, let them fight each other.
Very good, innocent.
I had thought you would have killed but you didn't.
Rest now.
Morpheus requires a second challenge soon.
They're going to sacrifice me...
They're going to sacrifice me not...
They're going to sacrifice me.
They're not going to sacrifice you.
Xena!
Wait.
I don't know if you're real or not.
You don't know if I'm real?
This is my dream.
I'm the only one who is real.
Tell me something about you I don't know.
How's that going to prove anything?
Morpeus can guess anything I know.
Tell me something about you I don't know.
Very well.
All right.
Nobody but my mother knows this.
I had six toes on my right foot when I was born.
Don't look!
It's gone now!
It must be you.
Yeah, it must be you.
Morpheus would have used something vaguely familiar to me.
My dreamscape passage and your dream must be overlapping.
Nice outfit.
Yeah.
Are you all right?
Listen to me, Gabrielle.
They want you to kill.
And no matter what, you can't do it.
I thought they wanted me to marry Morpheus.
Morpheus wants you to lose your blood innocence.
Once you do, you'll be sacrificed as his bride.
I've already been through one of their challenges.
And there were two of them.
I did what you said.
They killed each other.
Does that count?
If it did, you'd be on your honeymoon by now.
OK.
Option A is out.
No killing.
So let's talk about option B.
What is it?
I need time.
Use what you know to defend yourself until I can break through the passage into the fortress.
What do I know that's going to keep me alive until you show up?
-What's the matter?
-I don't know.
I feel strange.
Xena?
Talking!
That's what you're good at!
Use your mind, Gabrielle!
Xena?
Xena?
Xena?
Xena?
I don't suppose you want my breakfast order.
Prepare yourself for the next challenge, innocent.
This one will not be quite as easy as the first.
You shouldn't fear using a blade to protect yourself.
Morpheus would understand.
I bet he would.
He seems like an understanding kind of god.
What if I just killed you right now?
Is that what you wish to do?
It was a hypothetical question.
I don't suppose that you'd want to let me sleep a little longer, would you?
I mean, I'd hate to show up the blushing bride with circles under my eyes.
Just seven or eight hours?
Time is not on your side, innocent.
I know about your friend in the dreamscape passage.
I have warriors looking for her body.
She'll be dead long before she could help you.
Look for wagon tracks.
Manus wants them dead.
This is all the N'Kama oil I have, Xena.
Morpheus, you're not gonna win!
Save yourself, innocent.
Morpheus wants you to succeed.
I'll bet he does.
I won't be needing this.
Yes, innocent.
Draw blood.
Use what I know.
Use what I'm good at.
I'm not really good at anything, except talking.
Slow down!
Not all at once.
I mean, let's face it, I'm going to get a bit tired.
So, why don't we be fair about this?
Whichever one of you is the best fighter, I'll take you on first.
And then the second, and then...
Well, the easy pickings.
So, who is it?
Who's the best?
You?
Really?
Well, I would have thought...
Yeah, that would have been my guess.
Clever girl...
I guess we know where they place you.
One of you has got to be better than the other.
You're smarter than I gave you credit for, innocent.
Somehow, you've learned that Morpheus demands you spill blood.
You've had two opportunities.
The next challenge will not have options.
You take the life offered you or you die.
Surprised to see me again?
Not really.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
How about me?
Termin?
Even in your weakened state, you can't forget your first.
And I was only the first of many, wasn't I?
The first notch on your hilt.
Here...
I still have the scar where you slit my throat.
You attacked our village.
Friends of mine, people I grew up with, died under your sword.
You were still an innocent then.
Like Gabrielle.
Soon, she'll be just like you.
She's going to taste blood.
She'll be haunted by all the familiar demons.
-There'll be a first kill to remember.
-Like me.
-And a last kill to try and forget.
-Like me.
Everything you have felt, she will know.
The screams of her murdered will deafen her.
No.
And there's nothing you can do to save her.
Your body in the outside world dies and you die along with it.
-I can stop you.
-With what?
This is my dream.
My passage.
I control it.
Hold on, Gabrielle!
I'm almost there!
No, no, Xena.
You can't leave yet.
You haven't passed your final test.
Who are you?
Oh, you know me.
You know me better than any opponent you've ever faced.
This might be your dreamscape but you can't control me.
I am you.
You can't go through that door until you have the key.
And you can't go through life trying to deny that I'm the real you.
We were so happy all those years...
Don't you remember?
Putting fear into all.
ushing aside those who stood in our way.
Taking what we wanted.
-Ah, those were the days.
-That wasn't me.
That was never who I really was.
Well, let me ask you this.
Back then, didn't it feel right?
Everything we did felt right.
If felt good.
-But it wasn't.
-Oh, how would you know?
You think this goody-goody act of yours is going to last?
There's no glory in being a hero, ask around.
You're weak without me, Xena.
But the fire is still there.
Join me.
All through this dreamscape passage, I've had to fight people I've killed before.
And I couldn't bring myself to kill 'em again.
But, as I face you, I realize it can mean only one thing.
Yes...
It means what?
Tell me.
It means I finally get to kill you.
Xena!
Xena, hurry!
Defend yourself, innocent.
He'll kill you, as soon as you come within reach.
Pick up the sword.
You can't defeat me!
I'm stronger!
I've always been stronger!
You're just a dark reminder of a disease I once had.
If you were that strong, I would never have left you.
But I did.
Ever wonder how the rest of the world sees you?
Curious?
Watch as if you had the eyes of your victims.
Hold him!
You men don't know what you're doing!
Don't let Manus get away with this!
Pick up the sword!
No, no, my sister.
You can't leave.
You still haven't found the key.
You take for granted all your gifts and talents...
Me.
Everything you are today came from me.
Every spark of noble quality that made you a great leader...
Me.
The strength that made men tremble at your name...
It all came from me!
You understand?
I understand.
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't exist.
Whether I like it or not, you're the key.
You're the key.
There's only one way out of this dreamscape...
You!
You're the key to my nightmares.
And no matter what part of me you think you are...
I control you.
What happened?
Where is she?
Yeah!
-Kill her!
Kill them both!
-Xena, catch!
I knew you'd come!
Well, I thought you would.
I almost gave up on you.
You have no idea what kind of enemy you've made.
Morpheus will not be denied.
You think he's just going to let you walk out of here?
-Punching's all right?
-I'm impressed.
This is the last of it.
-How much do I owe you?
-Owe me?
After taking away the fear of the mystics?
After making this valley a safe place to raise a family?
-Ten per cent off everything.
-You miser!
Don't you dare charge her one single nugget of gold!
Lord Elkton.
Ah, of course not.
Just kidding.
I hope so.
Unless you want nightmares for the rest of your life.
What do you think?
Very nice.
I take it you got your old job back.
My old job as Mystic Head Priest and my eyesight.
Tomorrow, we start the grain festival.
From now on, the only thing we'll sacrifice will be corn.
Thanks to you.
Glad I could help.
What did you decide to do about Manus?
Manus?
That was easy.
We decided to put him into his own dreamscape passage and let his past demons decide his fate.
Xena, you and your friend have saved this valley, these people, me.
From now on we'll worship the three dream god brothers the way they were supposed to be...
With joy, not fear.
Speaking of your friend...?
She's waiting for me.
I have to go.
If you're ever in this area...
Well, you know where to come.
I do.
Thanks.
And...
Sweet dreams.
Ready to go?
Xena...
I could have killed someone.
I mean...
I was capable of it.
We're all capable of it.
The point is, you didn't cross that line.
But I got close enough to peak over.
And what I saw scared me.
See how calm the surface of the water is?
That was me once.
And then...
The water ripples and churns.
That's what I became.
But if we sit here long enough, it will go back to being still again.
It will go back to being calm.
But the stone's still under there.
It's now part of the lake.
It might look as it did before, but it's forever changed.
Come on.
Let's go.
For your first stab at wisdom, you did all right.
I was just saying that for your benefit.
You didn't think I meant it, did you?
Huh, not me.
I wasn't fooled.
Subtitles: @marlonrock1986 (^^V^^)
Retreat!
No.
No.
No.
Nooooo!
He can't be dead!
But, Mother... one of the soldiers told me that Aelon had been killed during the battle.
- Then why can't you find his body?
- I don't know.
I'll keep looking.
I promise you.
- Ah, Son!
- Aelon.
My heart told me you were still alive!
Ahh!
Ahhhh!
Help me, Krytus, please.
Boy, tilling fields all day is not my idea of fun.
Armus is a warrior who grew old.
He needed our help.
Well, I wish he'd ask us to...
I don't know slay a monster or sumin'.
That's my idea of a good deed.
- I'll try to remember that, Iolaus.
- Thank you very much.
Hercules!
Hercules!
What's the trouble?
My brother... he's dead.
- You have my sympathy.
- Yeah, mine, too.
No, no, we just saw him, my mother and I.
- Well, he's...
- He what?
He's a ghost.
This is the story of a time long ago.
A time of myth and legend, when the ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they plagued mankind with suffering.
Only one man dared to challenge their power-Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the earth, battling the minions of wicked stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
But wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be Hercules.
Aelon was a great soldier.
He always taught me that he fought twice as hard so that I wouldn't have to join up.
My job was to take care of our mother.
When the other soldier said he'd been killed, I searched all day, but I couldn't find his body until that night.
When... his spirit... walked in the door.
I don't know what else to call it.
My hand went right through him.
It was like he was there except he wasn't.
- But he still spoke to you?
- Just a few words his voice sounded so far away, like from another world.
But it's not just Aelon.
Other soldiers are missing, too.
Someone is stealing the bodies of the dead.
And their honor as well.
Does that mean you'll come back to Tantalus with me?
Yes, it does.
Sounds like I've been gone too long.
Iolaus, care to join us?
Well... you know, if I gotta choose between ghosts and tilling a field?
Ghosts are good.
So, Krytus, a young fellow like you must dream of becoming a hero someday.
Any, uh... questions I can answer for you?
Actually, I wanna be a scholar.
My dad was one.
Besides, I've only heard stories about Hercules.
- Are you a hero, too?
- Ah... well, you know, uh... some people like to think so.
Sounds like a good place to interrupt.
Krytus.
So tell me how long has there been trouble in Tantalus?
Ever since King Memnos died.
- The king died?
When?
- About three months ago.
It's a shame.
He was a good man.
I helped him defend your valley against the Macedonians.
Must have been ten years ago.
You're probably too young to remember.
Yes, but I've heard the tale many times.
Aelon said that when their army stormed the city you held a hundred soldiers at bay by yourself.
- Well, it was more like, fifty.
- But you did save the king and you broke a catapult in two with your bare hands.
Krytus, I thought you said heroics didn't interest you.
Well, they don't.
But this is Hercules.
Our left flank was weak, yesterday.
We were lucky to hold her back.
Now I don't think she can mount another major offensive for several days, but sooner or later, she'll try again.
Make sure we're ready.
Yes, sir.
This can't be... the same Daulin.
Hercules!
What in the world...?
It's good to see ya, Daulin.
You look great not to mention tall.
You're actually looking a bit short.
From the tales we hear, you should be twenty feet high by now.
I was sorry to hear about your father.
You know how much I thought of him.
Thanks.
- What brings you back to Tantalus?
- Heard there was trouble.
My friend, Iolaus, and I thought we could help.
If Hercules calls you a friend, then so do I.
- Likewise.
- There's more than just trouble here.
- I'm in the middle of an all-out war.
- How's Poene?
I hope she's all right.
Hercules, it's Poene I'm fighting.
My own sister is tryin' to overthrow me.
This is a joke, right?
You two always used to pull those pranks on me.
I'd give anything to have those days back, but they're gone.
After I assumed the throne, my sister went mad with jealousy.
She spread lies throughout the town, called for revolution wound up turning half of Tantalus against me.
- That's hard to believe.
- It's as painful as my father's death maybe worse.
Hercules, if I knew Poene had wanted the kingdom,
I would have given it to her, but before I could do anything she started this war.
She somehow managed to convice Jarton.
- He's running her army for her.
- Jarton.
The two of us fought side-by-side for Daulin's father.
We were good friends.
But the bodies, Daulin.
We've heard stories of your dead disappearing.
That's the worst part of this nightmare.
Poene's men steal our dead.
Only the gods know why.
Iolaus, I've had some bad feelings over the years, but the one I've got right now, beats 'em all.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Hey, if I die someday on a battlefield you better make sure you bury me properly.
No, it's more than that.
I mean, this whole thing is wrong.
This isn't the legacy King Memnos deserves his two children trying to kill each other?
War is senseless enough, but when it tears apart a family--
- Huh... no one can win.
- Exactly.
If you had seen Daulin and Poene as kids they were wonderful and inseparable.
One of the main reasons I fought for Memnos was to make sure they got to grow up.
Makes you think a your own kids, too, doesn't it?
Yeah.
If my children had grown up to wage war on each other
I don't know what I'd do.
You'd stop them any way you could or die trying.
I'm going to Poene's camp and see if I can talk some sense into her.
I want you to keep an eye on things here.
If Daulin does anything foolish let me know right away.
- You know I will.
- I know.
Listen, crush-bucket, we fight with King Daulin!
He's got more money!
Poene will pay better!
We play for it two out of three!
One!
Two!
Three!
Parchment covers rock!
One!
Two!
Three!
Bite me!
Dagger cuts parchment!
One!
Two!
Three!
Ha-ha!
Rock smashes dagger!
Fight for Daulin!
Daulin!
- Good evening.
- Hey!
Who do you think you are?
Sneakin' up on us like that?
- It's Hercules.
- Well, would a look at that?
Not in the market for some mercenries, are you?
Uh, afraid not, I'm on my way to see Poene.
Is that right?
It's what he said, ya half-blind moron.
At least I don't have last night's dinner stuck in my chin hair!
You haven't seen anything strange out here, tonight, have you?
Hey, Hercules, I travel with that.
Oh, well, be careful, anyway.
Hey, we ain't afraid a nothin'!
You know?
If Hercules is going over to Poene's side and us, fighting for Daulin, isn't exactly written in stone...
Poene!
Go on!
Keep going!
I caught this one down by the river.
Invading our territory, you must not know what we do to spies.
What?
Give 'em a big kiss?
Hercules, my friend, it's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
It's been too long, Jarton.
It has.
Hercules.
- Hello, Poene.
- What brings you here?
I keep hearing about trouble.
I came to help.
- You willing to fight with us?
- No, not fight, help.
Daulin told me what's been going on between you two.
You haven't even spoken to me, and you've already sided with him.
Hold on, I'm not on anybody's side.
But he says you've been tryin' to take his throne ever since your father died.
I don't suppose Daulin told you that he killed our father!
- What?
- It's true, Hercules.
Daulin poisoned the king.
That's how he got the throne.
- All we want now is justice.
- But the way that he tells it--
He's lying.
The person you knew as Daulin was a lie.
In truth, he's nothing more than a murdering demon, and he does not deserve to wear my father's crown
- not a man who steals the dead.
- Your dead are being taken, too.
And it's destroying their families, not being able to bury them.
Your dead, Daulin's dead, there's nothing I'd like better than to stop this.
Excuse me.
Keep an eye on him.
Make sure he's here for the reason he says he is.
Hey, Krytus, what's goin' on?
Where's Hercules?
He's, uh, not around right now.
Why d'ya have that spear?
To avenge Aelon.
I'm joining up.
But you hate war.
You wanna be a scholar.
Well, sometimes, a man has to do something heroic like you and Hercules.
And if he's not here you can teach me how to fight.
Now, hold on.
All that hero talk was just talk.
I never said you should go into battle.
- You could get killed!
- I'm going anyway.
Now, you gonna teach me or not?
Where's the man who wore you?
Oh, no.
It's over for you, Graegus.
- Graegus!
- Ohhhh!
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't mean to frighten you.
- You called me Graegus... why?
- Do you know who he is?
Of course!
I know!
I'm an undertaker!
He's the dog of war and Ares is his master.
But I have no idea who you are, sir.
Hercules.
That makes sense if Graegus is near.
I should've known it was him.
- Who did you think was taking them?
- Ha, the competition.
Ha.
No, no, no, no, when ya lunge, ya gotta keep your elbows in.
And this should be.
But kid real battles get messy fast.
It takes years to perfect these moves.
There's no way y--
When I advance, where do I keep my weight?
On your front foot.
Otherwise you'll fall flat on your butt.
But listen to me, Krytus, you're just a boy.
You should be home, lookin' after your mom.
If Hercules was here, he'd say the exact same thing.
- How do I fight a guy with a sword?
- You don't!
You get yourself home and hide under your bed till this damn thing is over!
King Daulin wants to see you now.
Hercules left last night.
One of my scouts saw him going over to Poene's side.
He went to talk to her to try and put an end to this madness.
Why should I believe you?
You're a stranger!
But Hercules isn't!
He was a friend to your father and to you.
He would sooner scale Mt.
Olympus and kiss Hera on the lips than betray a friend!
True, but I can't take chances with the security of my people.
They've been betrayed enough.
We're through waiting for Poene to strike.
We attack tonight!
Come here!
Over here, men!
Come on!
OK, kid, come on.
We'll make a soldier out of you yet.
- Over here!
- Let's go.
Remember, birdbrain, we don't settle for less than ten dinars a day.
Ten?
We worked the last job for ten!
This time, we hold out for twelve!
Hey, buddy, who's in charge, here?
Uh, good afternoon, captain... we were wondering if you could use two battle-savvy fighting men?
We own our weapons, we have excellent references, and...
- Forget it, let's get outta here.
- What?
- Come on!
We're leaving!
- I thought we were...!
- Poene, can I have a word with you?
- What is it, Hercules?
Do you remember when I was here years ago and Daulin always pestered me to tell him stories?
He used to follow you like a puppy.
Always saying, 'Please, Hercules, just one more, just one more.'
I never liked to show it, but I always listened to you, too.
- Then you remember the story of Graegus.
- He's a feared warrior, isn't he?
Graegus is no warrior.
He's a dog a huge beast, belonging to Ares, the god of war.
He feeds on dead soldiers.
He grows more powerful with every soul he consumes.
- Why does this matter now?
- Because Graegus is here, now, which means Ares is, too.
He's behind this war manipulating it, because the blood Graegus craves most is family blood.
Don't make excuses for Daulin.
This war is about the murder of my father!
It's about supplying blood for Graegus.
And without proper burial, the human souls he takes can't pass to the other side.
Don't you see?
You, your brother, your armies, you're all being used.
Hercules, you don't know how evil Daulin's become.
The evil is Ares.
Stop this war before one more family's torn apart.
Believe me once you've lost the people you love you don't get them back.
Get outta here!
What got into you?
You just walked away from a sweet deal!
It was that guy back there.
I've seen him before.
- I fought against him.
- So what?
That's the nature of the job!
Fight against them one battle, fight with them the next!
But that guy shouldn't have a 'Next'.
A couple of months back I was in a battle in Thrace.
I was sneaking through a trench.
It was pitch dark, raining.
I got the jump on that guy that very same guy.
- What do you mean?
- He never saw me coming!
I rammed my spear right through his heart!
I killed him.
No, must have been some other guy.
Jarton...
I need to talk to you.
And I need to talk with you.
What's all this you've been telling Poene?
Myths of dogs that eat the dead?
It's nonsense.
I wish it was.
Right now is not the time to weaken her resolve not right before a battle.
A soldier can't afford that!
What if there doesn't have to be a battle?
- You're dreamin'!
- That's exactly what Ares wants you to think.
He's the one who's causing all this.
He's playing both sides like puppets.
Still the same Hercules.
First sign a evil, you start pointing' your finger at gods and monsters.
Truth is, my friend when power's at stake men can be just as ruthless as gods and as vicious as monsters.
Daulin's proof of that.
You sound like you want this war to happen.
I was sworn to King Memnos.
It is my duty to avenge his death.
Anything happens beyond that it's out of my control.
Who are you?
- You're here with Hercules, aren't you?
- Yeah, when I can find him.
Wait a minute.
What about answering my question?
Hey!
Great, are they looking for y--
Over here!
Shhhhhhh.
This way!
- What a bunch of amateurs.
- Amateurs, huh?
Uh, I meant them guys, not you.
Huh.
- Sir, Iolaus is gone.
- What do you mean, 'Gone'?
Where?
I don't know.
He just disappeared, same as Hercules.
Krytus, you travelled with him.
You know Iolaus better than any of us.
Do you think he's abaondoned us for Poene?
Sir, Iolaus isn't any more of a traitor than Hercules is.
I'm afraid I can't be as sure of that as you are.
Assemble the troops.
Prepare to attack!
Are you guys deaf or just plain dumb?
I told you, I'm a friend of Hercules.
- Keep moving!
- I can't believe this.
- I'm one of the good guys!
- It's all right.
He's a friend.
Oh-oh-oh, sure.
Don't take my word for it.
You know?
I think we could all use a lesson in that little word called, 'trust'.
And as for you, thanks for abandoning me down by the river.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
One minute you're there, then as soon as trouble comes along poof!
You're gone!
Just like that!
Thanks a lot.
- One of you guys hit him on the head?
- Uh-uh.
Hmm.
Here let me get your hands.
- Maybe a walk'll help clear your head.
- I don't need to clear my head.
- Yeah, ya do.
- I do?
Mm-hmm.
What did you mean about seeing Jarton down by the river?
Well, I meant I saw Jarton down by the river, about five minutes ago.
That can't be.
Jarton's been in that tent for the last hour.
Well, then he has a double running around, 'cause this guy sure looked like him.
- Where did you see him?
- Why?
What's going on?
- Just tell me where!
- All right, all right.
Well, you gotta go past these bushes here just over the other side--
Where's Hercules?
- Oh, he had to take care of sum in.
- Damn.
He told me to tell him if I found out anything about those missing bodies.
- And did you?
- Yeah, we should wait for Hercules, right?
No!
There's no time to wait!
Tell me.
Maybe I should just show you.
Jarton.
So the worst really is true.
I'm afraid so, Hercules.
I am but a ghost now.
- But, how?
- Last winter
King Memnos sent me to Thrace to fight on behalf of his brother.
- I was struck down in battle.
- And Ares stole your body.
Now he's back here, fooling everyone into trusting him.
I'm sorry, my friend.
If I had known--
That's past.
The real tragedy is now.
Daulin didn't murder his father.
Ares did to divide their family and start a war.
They're both trying to kill each other for a wrong neither of them committed.
Without our bodies without ceremony we can't cross over into the afterworld.
We're stuck here in this terrible limbo between life and death.
I'll set things right, I promise.
Some of those we face may once have been friends!
Even family.
But they are the enemy now.
As I look into your faces
I see that you have the strength to defeat Poene's treachery.
- You have the power to win!
- Yeah!
- Poene, where's Jarton?
- He left with Iolaus, why?
- Which way'd they go?
- That way, toward the cave.
Hercules!
What's wrong?
Iolaus!
Iolaus!
Hercules!
Stay away!
- Where are you?
- I'm right above you!
Hercules, you gotta get outta here!
It's a trap!
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
- What was that?
- You don't wanna know.
But you know, don't you, Hercules?
That's right, Ares, I do.
Fresh new face, but the same old stench.
- Ares?
I thought he was Jarton!
- So does everyone else.
That's how this murdering coward is able to turn brother
- and sister aganst each other.
- Always harping about family, aren't you?
I don't know why!
You don't speak to your father!
Your step-mother hates your guts!
And your wife and children have been turned to ashes!
Leave my family out of this, you bastard!
- Is that any way to talk to your brother?
- Half-brother.
It's a half that doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.
I knew you were evil, Ares, but to start a war just to feed your dog, you disgust me.
Obviously, you're not a pet-lover.
You've turned family against each other innocent lives destroyed.
Hey, what can I say?
Graegus has a special fondness for blood feuds.
Well, this is one feud that is going to end right now.
Always the optimist, aren't you?
Well, here's the grim reality.
Uh, Hercules, maybe it's time for me to get down, huh?
Graegus is gonna work up a helluvan appetite, tearing you two to shreds.
I better go stir up a battle to make sure he has something to eat afterwards.
Ares!
I don't like this.
Uh, hey!
Uh, maybe it's not so bad!
If this thing only eats the dead we should be OK, right?
Ares didn't say it would eat us only that it would tear us to shreds.
So as long as that doesn't bother you--
That's not what I wanted to hear.
Here!
Burn yourself free!
Thanks.
Oh, great, now it wants to fetch.
Poene, we have a real problem.
- You were right.
Hercules is a spy.
- Are you sure?
I wish I wasn't, but I saw him going over to Daulin's side along with Iolaus.
I should a listened to you from the beginning.
I guess I just wanted to think better of Hercules.
There's no one to trust.
You can always trust me.
- I don't know what to do, anymore.
- We have no choice.
Daulin and Hercules will slaughter us if we don't attack right away.
Sound the call to battle!
Ahhhh!
To the river!
They're advancing rapidly, sir.
They're attacking at full strength!
Move to the river!
Hercules!
It's got me!
Ahhh!
Anytime you're ready, Hercules!
Ahh!
Now would be good!
Ahh!
Pull tight!
We got him trapped!
Iolaus!
Tie your end off!
- How long is that gonna hold him?
- I have no idea.
The battle!
Move it, Iolaus!
No second thoughts.
They deserver to die.
Now, sound the battle call.
Ha-hah!
- We're not gonna make it!
- We have to make it!
Attack!
No!
Stop!
You've been tricked!
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!
It's no use.
It's not working.
Jarton, where are you?
Don't let this happen.
Don't fight!
Stop!
Stop!
Well, that's a little more like it.
Aelon!
There's no reason for you to fight!
That's why your loved ones came here to stop you.
Only Ares wants you to fight!
He needs your blood to feed his dog!
But Daulin killed King Memnos.
Jarton said so.
That was a lie.
This is the real Jarton.
Hercules tells the truth.
Ares killed our king.
That's right, Ares, run away!
There'll be no battle tonight!
That's what you think!
If only one man dies tonight it'll be you.
Iolaus, no!
Ahhhhhh!
Uh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
That's the spirit, Hercules.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ahhhh!
Yuh!
Ahhh!
Go!
- For us!
- Get him!
Go, Hercules!
What's the matter, Hercules?
I know there's more fight in you than that.
And a fight is exactly what you want.
You feed on anger and hate.
Ahh!
Come on, Hercules!
Come on!
Fight him!
Fight him!
Come on, Hercules, show me that rage inside of you!
- Go, Hercules!
- Come on!
Get up!
Fight me, Hercules!
No, there'll be no more fighting from me or any of these people.
Throw down your weapons!
Throw them down!
Do it!
Hercules, I'll be back.
Know that.
Not today.
Whoo-hoooooooo!
- Poene!
- Brother!
I should have trusted you all along, Hercules.
- So should I. Instead, I was a fool.
- It's all right.
At least it's over.
But what about Graegus?
If that beast is still out there--
Ares and his dog can only survive in a land of war.
As long as you're at peace there's nothing to fear from either of them.
Now, there's one more thing we have to do.
You made us whole again, Hercules.
Now we can cross over to the other side.
It's a very special friend, who can help a man,even after his death.
I guess it isn't possible for us to shake hands, is it?
I'm afraid not.
Then let me wish you peace.
Poene, Daulin, your father always expected me to be here to help you.
I'm sorry I won't have that privilege.
Your lessons will stay with us, Jarton.
And we'll honor them the best way we can by ruling together.
Thank you.
Looks like we better be going.
I'll say hello to your father for you.
Goodbye, Son.
It's time to make sure these men are never disturbed again.
And peace to you, my friends.
Peace to you, Hercules.
Has a nice ring about it, doesn't it?
Yeah, too bad we don't hear it more often.
So, Iolaus, where are we going next?
I don't know, but how about we try to find some fields to till?
Retreat!
Quickly!
Don't let them escape!
No!
-He can't be dead!
-But Mother...
One of the soldiers told me that Aelon had been killed during the battle.
Then why can't you find his body?
I don't know.
I'll keep looking.
I promise you.
-Son!
-Aelon!
My heart told me you were still alive!
Help me, Krytus.
Please.
There you go.
Boy...
Tilling fields all day is not my idea of fun.
Armus is a warrior who grew old.
He needed our help.
Well, I wish he'd ask us to...
I don't know, slay a monster or sum'in'.
That's my idea of a good deed.
-I'll try to remember that, Iolaus.
-Thank you very much.
Hercules!
Hercules!
-What's the trouble?
-My brother.
He's dead.
-You have my sympathy.
-Yeah, mine, too.
No, no.
We just saw him.
My mother and I.
Well, he's...
He what?
He's a ghost.
This is the history of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the ancient gods were petty and cruel and they plagued mankind with suffering.
Only one man dared to challenge their power:
Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the Earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
But wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
Hercules!
Aelon was a great soldier.
He always taught me that he fought twice as hard so that I wouldn't have to join up.
My job was to take care of our mother.
When the other soldier said he'd been killed I searched all day, but I couldn't find his body.
-Until that night.
-When...
-...his spirit... walked in the door.
-I don't know what else to call it.
My hand went right through him.
It was like he was there, except he wasn't.
-But he still spoke to you?
-Just a few words.
His voice sounded so... far away, like from another world.
But it's not just Aelon.
Other soldiers are missing, too.
Someone is stealing the bodies of the dead.
And their honor as well.
Does that mean you'll come back to Tantalus with me?
Yes, it does.
Sounds like I've been gone too long.
Iolaus, care to join us?
Well, you know...
If I gotta choose between ghosts and tilling a field?
Ghosts are good.
So, Krytus...
A young fellow like you must dream of becoming a hero someday.
Any... questions I can answer for you?
Actually, I wanna be a scholar.
My dad was one.
Besides, I've only heard stories about Hercules.
Are you a hero, too?
Ah, well, you know...
-Some people like to think so.
-Sounds like a good place to interrupt.
Krytus.
So tell me, how long has there been trouble in Tantalus?
Ever since King Memnos died.
-The king died?
When?
-About three months ago.
It's a shame.
He was a good man.
I helped him defend your valley against the macedonians.
Must have been ten years ago.
You're probably too young to remember.
Yes, but I've heard the tale many times.
Aelon said that when their army stormed the city you held a hundred soldiers at bay by yourself.
Well, it was more like, fifty.
But you did save the king, and you broke a catapult in two with your bare hands.
Krytus...
I thought you said heroics didn't interest you.
Well, they don't.
But this is Hercules.
Our left flank was weak, yesterday.
We were lucky to hold her back.
Now I don't think she can mount another major offensive for several days but sooner or later, she'll try again.
Make sure we're ready.
Yes, sir.
This can't be the same Daulin.
Hercules!
What in the world?
It's good to see ya, Daulin.
You look great.
-Not to mention, tall.
-You're actually looking a bit short.
From the tales we hear, you should be twenty feet high by now.
I was sorry to hear about your father.
You know how much I thought of him.
Thanks.
What brings you back to Tantalus?
Heard there was trouble.
My friend, Iolaus, and I thought we could help.
If Hercules calls you a friend, then so do I.
Likewise.
There's more than just trouble here.
I'm in the middle of an all-out war.
How's Poene?
I hope she's all right.
Hercules, it's Poene I'm fighting.
My own sister is tryin' to overthrow me.
This is a joke, right?
You two always used to pull those pranks on me.
I'd give anything to have those days back, but they're gone.
After I assumed the throne, my sister went mad with jealousy.
She spread lies throughout the town, called for revolution wound up turning half of Tantalus against me.
That's hard to believe.
It's as painful as my father's death.
Maybe worse.
Hercules, if I knew Poene had wanted the kingdom, I would have given it to her but before I could do anything, she started this war.
She somehow managed to convice Jarton.
-He's running her army for her.
-Jarton...
The two of us fought side-by-side for Daulin's father.
We were good friends.
But the bodies, Daulin...
We've heard stories of your dead disappearing.
That's the worst part of this nightmare.
Poene's men steal our dead.
Only the gods know why.
Iolaus, I've had some bad feelings over the years but the one I've got right now, beats 'em all
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Hey...
If I die someday on a battlefield you better make sure you bury me properly.
No, it's more than that.
I mean, this whole thing is wrong.
This isn't the legacy King Memnos deserves.
His two children trying to kill each other?
War is senseless enough...
-...but when it tears apart a family...
-No one can win.
Exactly.
If you had seen Daulin and Poene as kids...
They were wonderful... and inseparable.
One of the main reasons I fought for Memnos was to make sure they got to grow up.
Makes you think 'a your own kids, too...,
-...doesn't it?
-Yeah.
If my children had grown up to wage war on each other...
-...
I don't know what I'd do.
-You'd stop them any way you could...
...or die trying.
I'm going to Poene's camp and see if I can talk some sense into her.
I want you to keep an eye on things here.
If Daulin does anything foolish...
-...
let me know right away.
-You know I will.
I know.
-We fight with King Daulin!
-He's got more money!
Poene will pay better!
We play for it.
Two out of three.
One, two, three.
Parchment covers rock.
One, two, three.
Bite me!
Dagger cuts parchment.
One, two, three.
Rock smashes dagger.
Fight for Daulin!
Daulin!
Good evening.
Hey!
Who do you think you are?
Sneakin' up on us like that?
-It's Hercules.
-Well!
Wouldja look at that?
Not in the market for some mercen'ries, are you?
Afraid not.
I'm on my way to see Poene.
Is that right?
It's what he said, ya half-blind moron!
At least I don't have last night's dinner stuck in my chin hair.
You haven't seen anything strange out here tonight, have you?
Hey, Hercules, I travel with that!
Well, be careful, anyway.
Hey...
We ain't afraid 'a nothin'.
You know?
If Hercules is going over to Poene's side and us, fighting for Daulin, isn't exactly written in stone...
Poene!
Go on!
Keep going!
I caught this one down by the river.
Invading our territory?
You must not know what we do to spies.
What?
Give 'em a big kiss?
-Hercules, my friend, it's good to see you.
-It's good to see you.
-It's been too long, Jarton.
-It has.
Hercules?
-Hello, Poene.
-What brings you here?
I keep hearing about trouble.
I came to help.
You willing to fight with us?
No, not fight.
Help.
Daulin told me what's been going on between you two.
You haven't even spoken to me, and you've already sided with him.
Hold on, I'm not on anybody's side.
But he says you've been tryin' to take his throne ever since your father died.
I don't suppose Daulin told you that he killed our father!
What?
It's true, Hercules.
Daulin poisoned the king.
That's how he got the throne.
All we want now is justice.
-But the way that he tells it...
-He's lying.
The person you knew as Daulin was a lie.
In truth, he's nothing more than a murdering demon and he does not deserve to wear my father's crown.
-Not a man who steals the dead.
-Your dead are being taken, too.
And it's destroying their families, not being able to bury them.
Your dead, Daulin's dead...
There's nothing I'd like better than to stop this.
Excuse me.
Keep an eye on him.
Make sure he's here for the reason he says he is.
Hey, Krytus.
-What's goin' on?
-Where's Hercules?
He's not around right now.
-Why d'ya have that spear?
-To avenge Aelon.
I'm joining up.
But you hate war.
You wanna be a scholar.
Well, sometimes, a man has to do something heroic.
Like you and Hercules.
And if he's not here, you can teach me how to fight.
Now, hold on.
All that hero talk was just talk.
I never said you should go into battle.
You could get killed.
I'm going anyway.
Now, you gonna teach me or not?
Where's the man who wore you?
Oh, no...
It's over for you, Gregus!
Gregus!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.
You called me Graegus.
Why?
-Do you know who he is?
-Of course...
I know.
I'm an undertaker.
He's the... dog of war.
And...
Ares... is his master.
But I have no idea who you are, sir.
Hercules.
That makes sense if Graegus is near.
I should've known it was him.
Who did you think was taking them?
The competition.
No, no.
When ya lunge, ya gotta keep your elbows in.
And this should be...
But, kid...
Real battles get messy fast.
It takes years to perfect these moves.
There's no way y...
When I advance, where do I keep my weight?
On your front foot.
Otherwise you'll fall flat on your butt.
But listen to me, Krytus.
You're just a boy.
You should be home, lookin' after your mom.
If Hercules was here, he'd say the exact same thing.
-How do I fight a guy with a sword?
-You don't!
You get yourself home and hide under your bed till this damn thing is over!
King Daulin wants to see you.
Now.
Hercules left last night.
One of my scouts saw him going over to Poene's side.
He went to talk to her, to try and put an end to this madness.
Why should I believe you?
You're a stranger.
But Hercules isn't!
He was a friend to your father...
and to you.
He would sooner scale Mt.
Olympus and kiss Hera on the lips than betray a friend.
True.
But I can't take chances with the security of my people.
They've been betrayed enough.
We're through waiting for Poene to strike.
We attack tonight!
You heard him!
Let's go!
Ready the troops!
Prepare for the attack!
Over here, men!
Come on!
We'll make a soldier out of you yet.
Remember, birdbrain.
We don't settle for less than ten dinars a day.
Ten?
!
We worked the last job for ten!
This time, we hold out for twelve.
Hey, buddy, who's in charge, here?
Lunge!
That's it!
Keep praciticing!
A great warrior fights fearlessly!
Lunge!
Twist!
Reset!
Good afternoon, captain.
We were wondering if you could use two battle-savvy fighting men.
We own our weapons, we have excellent references, and...
Forget it!
-Forget it.
Let's get outta here.
-What?
-Come on!
We're leaving!
-I thought we were...
Lunge!
Twist!
Reset!
Poene...
-Can I have a word with you?
-What is it, Hercules?
Do you remember when I was here years ago and Daulin always pestered me to tell him stories?
He used to follow you like a puppy.
Always saying: "Please, Hercules, just one more."
"Just one more."
I never liked to show it, but...
I always listened to you, too.
Then you remember the story of Graegus.
He's a feared warrior, isn't he?
Graegus is no warrior.
He's a dog, a huge beast, belonging to Ares, the god of war.
He feeds on dead soldiers.
He grows more powerful with every soul he consumes.
-Why does this matter now?
-Because Graegus is here, now.
Which means Ares is, too.
He's behind this war, manipulating it because the blood Graegus craves most is family blood.
Don't make excuses for Daulin.
This war is about the murder of my father!
It's about supplying blood for Graegus!
And without proper burial, the human souls he takes can't pass to the other side.
Don't you see?
You, your brother, your armies, you're all being used.
Hercules...
You don't know how evil Daulin's become.
The evil... is Ares.
Stop this war before one more family's torn apart.
Believe me.
Once you've lost the people you love you don't get them back.
Get outta here.
What got into you?
!
You just walked away from a sweet deal.
It was that guy back there.
I've seen him before.
-I fought against him.
-So what?
That's the nature of the job.
Fight against them one battle, fight with them the next.
But that guy shouldn't have a "next".
A couple of months back...
I was in a battle in Thrace.
I was sneaking through a trench.
It was pitch dark, raining.
I got the jump on that guy.
-That very same guy.
-O que quer dizer?
He never saw me coming!
I rammed my spear right through his heart!
I killed him.
No...
Must have been some other guy.
Jarton!
-I need to talk to you.
-And I need to talk with you.
What's all this you've been telling Poene?
Myths of dogs that eat the dead?
It's nonsense.
I wish it was.
Right now is not the time to weaken her resolve.
Not right before a battle.
A soldier can't afford that.
What if there doesn't have to be a battle?
You're dreamin'!
That's exactly what Ares wants you to think.
He's the one who's causing all this.
He's playing both sides like puppets.
Still the same Hercules.
First sign 'a evil, you start pointin' your finger at gods and monsters.
Truth is, my friend, when power's at stake men can be just as ruthless as gods and as vicious as monsters.
Daulin's proof of that.
You sound like you want this war to happen.
I was sworn to King Memnos.
It is my duty to avenge his death.
Anything happens beyond that, it's out of my control.
Who are you?
-You're here with Hercules, aren't you?
-Yeah, when I can find him.
Wait a minute.
What about answering my question?
Great.
Are they looking for y...?
Over here!
This way!
-What a bunch of amateurs.
-Amateurs, huh?
I meant them guys.
Not you.
Sir...
-Iolaus is gone.
-What do you mean, "gone"?
-Where?
-I don't know.
He just disappeared.
Same as Hercules.
Krytus, you travelled with him.
You know Iolaus better than any of us.
Do you think he's abaondoned us for Poene?
Sir, Iolaus isn't any more of a traitor than Hercules is.
I'm afraid I can't be as sure of that as you are.
Assemble the troops.
Prepare to attack!
Are you guys deaf or just plain dumb?
-I told you, I'm a friend of Hercules.
-Keep moving!
I can't believe this.
I'm one of the good guys!
It's all right.
He's a friend.
Oh, sure.
Don't take my word for it.
You know?
I think we could all use a lesson in that little word called, "trust".
And as for you...
Thanks for abandoning me down by the river.
-Me?
-Yeah, you.
One minute you're there, then as soon as trouble comes along, poof!
You're gone!
-Just like that!
Thanks a lot.
-One of you guys hit him on the head?
Here, let me get your hands.
-Maybe a walk'll help clear your head.
-I don't need to clear my head.
-Yeah, ya do.
-I do?
!
What did you mean about seeing Jarton down by the river?
I meant, I saw Jarton down by the river, about five minutes ago.
That can't be.
Jarton's been in that tent for the last hour.
Well, then he has a double running around, 'cause this guy sure looked like him.
Where did you see him?
-Why?
What's going on?
-Just tell me where.
All right, all right.
Well, you gotta go past these bushes here, just over the other side...
Where's Hercules?
He had to take care of sum'in.
Damn.
He told me to tell him if I found out anything about those missing bodies.
-And did you?
-Yeah, we should wait for Hercules, right?
No.
There's no time to wait.
Tell me.
Maybe I should just show you.
Jarton...
So the worst really is true.
I'm afraid so, Hercules.
-I am but a ghost now.
-But how?
Last winter, King Memnos sent me to Thrace to fight on behalf of his brother.
I was struck down in battle.
And Ares stole your body.
Now he's back here, fooling everyone into trusting him.
-I'm sorry, my friend.
If I had known...
-That's past.
The real tragedy is now.
Daulin didn't murder his father.
Ares did... to divide their family...
and start a war.
They're both trying to kill each other...
for a wrong neither of them committed.
Without our bodies, without ceremony..., we can't cross over into the afterworld.
We're stuck here n this terrible limbo...
between life and death.
I'll set things right.
I promise.
Some of those we face, may once have been friends!
Even family.
But they are the enemy now.
As I look into your faces I see that you have the strength to defeat Poene's treachery.
You have the power to win!
Poene...
-Where's Jarton?
-He left with Iolaus.
Why?
-Which way'd they go?
-That way, toward the cave.
Hercules!
What's wrong?
Iolaus!
Iolaus!
Hercules!
Stay away!
-Where are you?
-I'm right above you.
Hercules, you gotta get outta here!
It's a trap.
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
What was that?
You don't wanna know.
-But you know, don't you, Hercules?
-That's right, Ares, I do.
Fresh new face, but the same old stench.
-Ares?
I thought he was Jarton!
-So does everyone else.
That's how this murdering coward is able to turn brother and sister aganst each other.
Always harping about family, aren't you?
I don't know why.
You don't speak to your father.
Your step-mother hates your guts.
And your wife and children have been turned to ashes.
Leave my family out of this, you bastard!
-Is that any way to talk to your brother?
-Half-brother.
It's a half that doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.
I knew you were evil, Ares.
But to start a war just to feed your dog...
You disgust me.
-Obviously, you're not a pet-lover.
-You've turned family against each other.
-Innocent lives destroyed.
-Hey, what can I say?
Graegus has a special fondness for blood feuds.
Well, this is one feud that is going to end right now.
Always the optimist, aren't you?
Well, here's the grim reality.
Hercules...
Maybe it's time for me to get down, huh?
Graegus is gonna work up a helluvan appetite, tearing you two to shreds.
I better go stir up a battle to make sure he has something to eat afterwards.
Ares!
I don't like this.
Maybe it's not so bad.
If this thing only eats the dead, we should be ok, right?
Ares didn't say it would eat us.
Only that it would tear us to shreds.
So as long as that doesn't bother you...
That's not what I wanted to hear.
Here!
Burn yourself free!
Thanks!
Great.
Now it wants to fetch.
Poene, we have a real problem.
You were right.
Hercules is a spy.
-Are you sure?
-I wish I wasn't.
But I saw him going over to Daulin's side along with Iolaus.
I should 'a listened to you from the beginning.
I guess I just wanted to think better of Hercules.
There's no one to trust.
You can always trust me.
-I don't know what to do, anymore.
-We have no choice.
Daulin and Hercules will slaughter us... if we don't attack right away.
Sound the call to battle!
To the river!
Fight to defend King Memnos!
They're advancing rapidly, sir.
They're attacking at full strength!
Move to the river!
Hercules!
It's got me!
Anytime you're ready, Hercules!
Now would be good!
Pull tight!
We got him trapped!
Iolaus!
Tie your end off!
-How long is that gonna hold him?
-I have no idea.
The battle!
Move it, Iolaus!
No second thoughts.
They deserver to die.
Now, sound the battle call.
Start the advance!
Move out!
Steady and slow!
-We're not gonna make it!
-We have to make it!
Attack!
Attack!
-No!
Stop!
You've been tricked!
-Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!
It's no use.
It's not working.
Jarton, where are you?
Don't let this happen.
Don't fight!
Stop!
Stop!
Well...
That's a little more like it.
I don't believe it!
Aelon...
There's no reason for you to fight!
That's why your loved ones came here to stop you.
Only Ares wants you to fight!
He needs your blood to feed his dog!
But Daulin killed King Memnos.
-Jarton said so.
-That was a lie.
This is the real Jarton.
Hercules tells the truth.
Ares killed our king.
Where'd he go?
He's gone!
That's right, Ares.
Run away!
There'll be no battle tonight!
That's what you think!
If only one man dies tonight it'll be you.
Iolaus, no!
That's the spirit, Hercules.
-Hercules!
Get up!
-Get up!
Get him!
Go, Hercules!
-For us!
-Get him!
What's the matter, Hercules?
I know there's more fight in you than that.
And a fight...
is exactly what you want.
You feed on anger and hate.
Come on, Hercules!
Come on!
Fight him!
Fight him!
Come on, Hercules.
Show me that rage inside of you.
Go, Hercules!
Fight me, Hercules!
No.
There'll be no more fighting.
From me, or any of these people.
Throw down your weapons!
Do as he says!
Throw them down!
Drop your weapons!
Do it.
All of 'em!
You heard her.
Hercules, I'll be back.
Know that.
Not today.
-Poene!
-Brother!
-I should have trusted you, Hercules.
-So should I.
-Instead, I was a fool.
-It's all right.
At least it's over.
But what about Graegus?
If that beast is still out there...
Ares and his dog can only survive in a land of war.
As long as you're at peace, there's nothing to fear from either of them.
Now... there's one more thing we have to do.
You made us whole again, Hercules.
Now we can cross over to the other side.
It's a very special friend who can help a man...
even after his death.
I guess it isn't possible for us to shake hands, is it?
I'm afraid not.
Then let me wish you peace.
Poene, Daulin...
Your father always expected me to be here to help you.
I'm sorry I won't have that privilege.
Your lessons will stay with us, Jarton.
And we'll honor them the best way we can...
-...by ruling together.
-Thank you.
Looks like we better be going.
I'll say hello to your father for you.
Goodbye, son.
It's time to make sure these men are never disturbed again.
-And peace to you, my friends.
-Peace to you, Hercules.
Has a nice ring about it, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Too bad we don't hear it more often.
So, Iolaus, where are we going next?
I don't know.
But how about we try to find some fields to till?
Subtitles: @marlonrock1986 (^^V^^)
The Triangulum galaxy.
Three hundred billion planets, each one a thousand times larger than Earth.
A mass of more than fifty thousand light-years from end to end.
And yet surprisingly enough, not a single, decent place to eat.
(CHUCKLES)
It must be weird, being an astronomer and not being able to see.
Oh, I don't know.
What do you see when you look up at the sky at night?
The moon.
Stars.
Tiny little dots, far, far away.
Our eyes drawn to the twinkle of a hundred billion galaxies.
Giving life to illusion, illusion to life.
Something upon which to hang our hopes.
So why do you have a telescope?
It came with the place.
Show me something else.
I don't see anything.
You will.
Wow!
That was cool!
Is this a bad time, Professor?
Scott.
My friend and I were just admiring your comet.
New research assistant, professor?
Oh, come on, Commander, you know I put the education of our youth ahead of my own pathetic needs for love and understanding.
We envy your sacrifice, Tobias.
And now, if you'll extend that courtesy to Lucas, we could uplink your trackers.
We've got a comet to recover, remember?
You're right.
Hey, Lucas, when the Commander picks a name for his comet, make sure he goes with something folksy.
None of that Alpha Bravo numbers crap.
He's been pushing "Wolenczak's Comet" all morning.
Hey!
Hey, come on, that's folksy.
Hey, listen, if that thing burns itself out before
I've had a chance to study it, I'm calling it quits.
The energy it's packing, it could be my ticket out of our solar system.
You're sure there's something out there worth your time?
Well, I'm sure I'm not gonna find out till I get out there and take a look.
You're pretty casual about interstellar travel, aren't you?
On the contrary, Captain,
I find the idea fascinating.
It's just that, to date, nothing's ever fallen out of the sky that's done anything but remind us how vulnerable we are.
I'm on-line, professor.
The comet just passed through the Kuiper belt.
She's wet in 16 minutes.
She's flying!
Lieutenant Brody?
Status report.
Recovery team prepped and ready, sir.
MAN ON PA:
Science personnel call for recovery operation.
Commander, this stuff is amazing.
Hydrogen particles, remnant radiation, absolute matter, just a few seconds old.
I mean, if these readings are correct, that comet has traversed the entire known universe in less than six weeks.
That's billions of light-years from end to end.
Nothing moves that fast.
Dominant absolute matter does.
Absolute matter is a theory, it doesn't exist.
I mean, if it did, anyone could travel between galaxies in the blink of an eye.
What do you think of my comet now, Tobias?
I think you better keep an eye on it.
Lieutenant.
What's wrong?
I can't get to it, sir.
This thing's going up like a giant Bromo.
I don't know how much more of this heat I can take.
You able to recover anything?
JAMES:
No, sir, nothing.
She's gone.
NATHAN:
We've got every available unit in the area sweeping the perimeter.
Unfortunately, telemetry readings aren't holding out much hope.
Surface temperatures have even returned to normal.
It's like it never happened.
Scott, it was a comet.
It fell to Earth, it broke apart.
That's what comets do.
Yeah.
Well, interstellar travel just slipped through my fingers.
If I don't find a way to travel outside our galaxy,
I'm gonna lose my funding to this guy.
Hey, I lent you my boat, didn't I?
Look, Tobias, if I didn't know you better,
I'd swear that you were glad this thing broke apart.
I'm glad no one got hurt.
Whenever you go up against the forces of nature and get out with your hide intact, why you thank your lucky stars.
You thank them.
If you ask me, I got ripped off.
Scott, you've been to Mars and back.
Do you know how many people went with you?
Everyone from Leonardo Da Vinci to the Wright brothers was strapped inside that tin can right alongside you.
When our time comes, your contributions will be there, too.
Well, I don't plan on being there in spirit, Tobias.
I plan on being there in person.
Professor, thanks again for the use of your trackers.
Anytime, Nathan.
Kind of embarrassing falling on your face in front of the man who taught you everything.
Sorry, Commander.
We had six hours out there, and we're just pulling up water.
There's a cold front stirring things up.
Even if there were something to find, by now it's been blown miles from here.
Thanks for trying.
You can call the rest in, Jonathan.
Aye, sir.
FORD ON RADIO:
Seacraft, Alpha and Bravo, mission one is scrapped.
Return to base.
MAN ON RADIO:
Roger that, seaQuest.
We're heading in.
SCOTT:
Tobias is one of the great minds of our time.
Totally blind, and there isn't a solar system in our galaxy that he hasn't charted.
Did you know that when he was seven years old, that he pinpointed the exact moment that the universe was born?
I mean, at age seven, I barely knew my own birth date.
And at fourteen, he holds Newton's chair at Cambridge.
Oh, and I thought you were competitive with me.
It's like he was born for one reason.
It was to open our eyes to the wonders of the universe.
You should've seen him.
This skinny little fourteen-year-old kid totally captivating a roomful of NASA pencil necks.
Made us all feel like we were idiots.
You know, intelligence can only take us so far.
Then we have to get out and walk.
Yeah.
Well, you're lucky, Nathan, you've got this boat.
Your universe will always be within reach.
I'll never have that.
(THUDDING)
What is it, my friend?
He wants us to follow.
What is it, pal?
Darwin can't leave.
Too slimy.
What?
An oil spill?
What?
Not oil.
Blanket.
A blanket?
O'Neill, what's he saying?
I don't know.
I'm not reading any contaminants.
There's no internal ruptures or fuel leaks either.
Engage a WSKR.
Aye, sir.
Where is the blanket?
Around seaQuest.
Brings new life.
WSKR view up, sir.
Looks like a cocoon.
Ortiz, how deep are we?
I have no idea, sir.
Anything I ping out, just pings right back at me.
TONY ON RADIO:
Captain, I'm on...
I think someone should have a look at this thing.
I don't know what it is but... (STATIC)
Piccolo, repeat.
Piccolo?
He's in C-Deck, sir.
And it's got like everything shoved into a corner and I really think somebody ought to come down here and look at this!
Anybody?
SCOTT:
What is that?
The pimple from hell.
Has a main line busted?
Lucas, check the rest of the hull.
Feels like it's full of liquid.
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
Maybe the head's backed up, 'cause this thing stinks.
Structural integrity's fine.
Let's try the sonogram.
Okay.
(GENTLE THUMPING)
Captain.
It's a baby.
Yeah, but a baby what?
Interior Base 7, this is Commander Scott Keller, do you copy?
I need a priority one signal.
What kind of baby is it?
MIGUEL:
Question of the hour, Dag.
I'll tell you what it is.
It's an unknown biologic that's dragging us to the ocean floor.
I think it's kind of cute.
Base 7, this is Commander Keller.
Do you copy?
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't hold a signal.
Nothing can work in this heat.
Can we surface?
We're too heavy, Scott.
I can't afford to risk blowing the ballasts.
This thing is feeding off the bio-skin of our boat.
It's growing.
That's what babies do, Dag.
No.
He's right.
It is growing.
We're about to give birth to an alien.
Nathan, we've got to tell someone.
I'd like to share your enthusiasm, but I've got a submarine to get back on-line.
COMPUTER ON PA:
Activate level 10 emergency oxygen procedures.
Report to designated shelter stations.
That thing breathes our air.
Our air, our water.
All systems have shut down in sequence.
All right, Commander, let's go to level 10 emergency.
Lock off everything above the sea deck.
I want to move as far away from this thing as possible.
And I want guards on that thing around the clock.
Aye, sir.
Okay, people.
Let's move it.
(GROWLS)
(BOTH EXCLAIM)
(GROWLS)
LUCAS:
That's it.
No more juice.
We've seen enough.
It's got a full charge.
Good.
Hook it up to your tracker.
Let's hunt that thing down.
O'Neill?
I need a damage report.
Well, from what I can tell, sir, there is no damage, just no power.
All these cells have been drained dry.
All right, everyone stay in that shelter till this thing is found.
Ford and Brody are going on a search party.
The rest of us will be back as soon as we can.
I want all corridors sealed and locked behind us.
Is everyone accounted for?
TIMO THY:
No, sir.
We have three no-shows.
Miguel's one of them.
(TRACKER BEEPING)
I got activity on B-Deck.
Ortiz is missing?
Don't worry, Dagwood, we'll find him.
Coulter, Novacek, run flank with Brody.
You two with me.
Yes, sir.
I'm going, too.
No, you're not.
Nathan, this is my deal.
I can handle myself.
Okay, gentlemen, stay sharp.
Let's move.
I thought the aliens were our friends.
Well, I guess there's a good and bad in everything, Dagwood.
Is this a bad in everything?
Yes.
This is a very bad in everything.
(SNIFFS)
It smells like a bad in everything.
(BEEPING)
I'm getting something up ahead.
Come on.
Weapons on full.
There's something in here.
Miguel?
Ortiz?
(ALIEN GROWLING)
(SCREAMING)
Stop, you'll hit Coulter!
Lieutenant, what's going on?
It snatched Coulter right up through the grid work above C-Deck!
Jonathan, he's right below you.
Any sign of Miguel?
He was here, that's all I know.
Be careful, man.
This thing is fast.
What's up here?
It's the Mag-Lev.
But he's not up there.
Brody says he's on B-Deck.
SCOTT:
He was here for some reason.
You can't make sense of this thing, Commander.
It's a predator.
SCOTT:
Yeah.
Well, he may be a predator, but he's trying to make sense of us.
Brody, meet us at Mag-Lev.
(TRACKER BEEPING)
(SIGHS)
It's a scrub.
No, uh-uh.
Let's blast this one right now.
No, wait.
It's not another one.
It's Ortiz.
A person is missing until found, Commander.
Aye, sir.
If Ortiz is on this boat, we'll find him.
Get me Scott again.
Yeah?
Scott, what do we got here?
Oh, I wish I knew, Nathan.
He's collecting things.
Books, photographs, clothes, things from our world.
You think it's capable of processing information?
This stuff isn't random.
He wants something.
Well, I'm not gonna wait to find out what it is.
My interest in science lags when my crew is endangered.
This doesn't necessarily mean that Ortiz is dead.
No, sir.
Of course not.
No.
Absolutely not, sir.
These comlines can be set up for emergency power by satellite, right?
Yeah, but the E.B.S. Controls it from their end.
Yeah.
But we can tap into them if we need them, right?
Yes.
But the power would be negligible.
I mean, I'm not even sure how much power you can pull out of the atmosphere.
If it powers one extra pulse rifle, it's worth it.
Yeah.
Okay, we'd have to find a hot wire somewhere along the system.
Here.
Communications.
Well, somebody's gonna have to crawl through forty feet of ductwork to get there.
I'll do it.
It's no problem.
I'll go.
You better let me do this, all right?
Why, because it's dangerous?
Let me earn my keep, would you?
(SIGHS)
But remember, if you see anything or hear anything, don't hesitate to push that all-alert flash.
Got it.
Thanks.
Me and my big mouth.
I'm in.
Nothing.
Either his trail ends here, or this battery's dead.
Well, where is he?
Is there any other way to get this thing operational without power?
A back-up system?
No.
Once the power goes down, Mag-Lev goes with it.
If you're between stations, you gotta hoof it to the next stop.
I've done it.
It ain't pretty.
What about through here?
No.
It couldn't have gone through there.
That's an emergency exit.
Even with no power, if somebody goes through there, an alarm sounds throughout the entire boat.
SCOTT:
Not if he's fried the alarm system.
If he's inside the Mag-Lev tunnel, he can access the entire boat.
He's smarter than I thought.
(SNIFFING)
(BEEPING)
(SIGHS)
Dag, am I glad to see you.
I'm glad to see you.
Where is the baby bad thing?
Does that look like the work of a baby?
Help me out, would you?
Dag?
(ALIEN GROWLING)
(SHOUTS)
Dagwood.
You all right?
We barely even fazed that thing.
FORD:
Miguel?
(GROANING)
Thanks.
The others didn't make it out.
I tried to make it to the shelter, but the boat was sealed up tight.
Dagwood, you saved my life, man.
Thanks.
You're welcome, man.
It was a bad thing.
Let's get you guys to safe quarters.
(ALIEN GROWLING)
Tim?
I was able to hotwire the Vidlink.
It's re-booting through memory now.
Great job.
Ortiz is fine.
A little banged up, but he'll live to tell his grandkids.
(ALIEN GROWLING)
Henderson?
Lonnie?
Scott, my friend and I were just admiring your comet.
Lonnie!
Tim!
Tim!
Don't worry, Lonnie.
I'm coming!
Tim!
Lonnie!
Tim!
I got you.
Whoa!
(SCREAMING)
No!
(LONNIE SCREAMS)
Recharge weapons, then the medical facilities.
You might as well charge your shavers as useless as these pulse rifles are against that thing.
Captain, what about Henderson?
I'm not getting anything on the tracker, Lucas.
Well, then your trackers are wrong.
It's busted or something, the batteries are low.
But there's no way she can be gone.
She can't be gone!
It's fully charged, Lucas.
I'm sorry.
Easy.
Easy.
Maybe she's hiding.
Like Ortiz.
Even with Miguel down in the belly of this beast, it always registered something.
I should've gone.
It should've been me.
Captain, I'm getting something in the engine room.
LUCAS:
It's Henderson.
No.
No.
It's moving too fast.
Do we have enough power to charge the ballast?
Some.
Yeah, but not enough to drag us to the surface with this shell around us.
What happens if we empty the swim tubes?
We might have more pressure to work with.
All right.
Let's do it.
Secure Darwin in the moon pool, and we'll suck this thing into the swim tubes and blast it out through the ballast.
Lucas.
Yeah?
This was Henderson's choice.
And no matter what it looks like, it's not your fault.
Yeah, whether it's my fault or not, it sure feels like it is.
I guess I fail to see the difference.
Darwin's secured in C-Deck, Captain.
The tubes are drained.
(TRACKER BEEPING)
(ALIEN GROWLS)
He's on the move!
O'Neill, seal off B-Deck.
Now!
He's gone.
We missed him.
Here, give me that thing.
Rumor has it there's a blind spot up around the lock port
I hide in to get out of kitchen duty.
I really doubt it's true, sirs, but hey, you never know.
Must be true.
O'Neill, flood the tubes.
Flood tubes six and seven.
Now!
It's Henderson.
She's alive!
Piccolo.
Got her, sir.
NATHAN ON RADIO:
All right, let's close them down.
Come on.
Come on.
JAMES:
Grab her legs.
Get them.
(COUGHING)
I knew you'd make it.
I knew you couldn't be gone.
Thanks.
I was hiding from that thing.
I crawled inside the ballast.
Easy, easy.
Just take it easy.
I saw it get flushed out the ballast tubes.
It's gone, sir.
Let's get her to Med Bay.
No.
I can make it.
I'm okay.
When this is all over, this tub's gonna need some serious spring-cleaning.
What is this stuff?
Excess cocoonage.
It's jamming the swim tubes.
But it seems to be breaking up.
Ortiz, let's see if we can re-boot the system.
Aye, sir.
It's working, sir.
Vidlink, oxygen, thrusters.
Everything's coming back on-line.
We may be out of the woods.
Brody, run a scan over all of seaQuest.
Make sure this thing is really gone.
Don't have to, sir.
I can tell you right now, it's still on board.
Where?
Launch Bay and moving fast.
Who's driving that thing?
I don't know, sir.
They have their Vidlink turned off.
Start the security cam in the Launch Bay.
Aye-aye, sir.
What is she doing?
NATHAN:
Ortiz, override its power.
I can't, sir.
That thing's completely fried the guidance system.
I have no control over it.
Scott, my friend and I were just admiring your comet.
Vidlink always re-boot through memory?
Just the last few uplinks.
It's only got about 10-K.
And this same transmission played back when Henderson tapped into the E.B.S. Satellite system.
So we have mass times density into space, giving us the so-called bending of time.
But if time does truly loop around in its much ballyhooed continuum, why, then, can we only remember the past, and not the future?
Because pure density only exists in absolute matter.
But absolute matter doesn't exist.
It's a concept.
Unless you mean the absence of matter, miss...
Henderson.
Lonnie.
Miss Henderson Lonnie.
No, that's not what I meant.
I assume density is absolute.
And you assume correctly.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
I will see you all Thursday.
Anything else, Miss Henderson Lonnie?
Wouldn't the same mass density ratio also apply in absolutes?
(CHUCKLES)
No.
It would not.
Can I ask why?
If I can ask why such enormous questions come from such a pretty voice.
Okay, you caught me.
I memorized them from one of your book discs.
I was trying to get your attention by impressing you.
Now, why would someone want to do that?
I have a very curious mind.
Are you as thirsty as I am, Miss Henderson Lonnie?
(BEEPING)
Readings are redlining.
It's coming from that direction.
What drives our need to understand these things that twinkle on around us?
Isn't it just knowing that this great unknown is out there?
The wonder, the sheer inspiration.
"Thou art the star, for which all evening waits."
Oh, sorry.
I'm a sucker for great inspiration.
Did I do something to deserve that?
I guess I'm a sucker for it, too.
(SNARLING)
You threw that thing halfway across the room.
Oh, more than halfway, I should think.
What's it want, Tobias?
Why'd it come after you?
Thank you for saving my life, my friend.
We lost it in the woods.
That thing could be anywhere by now.
It won't go far.
I'm the one he wants.
The only ones in danger are the people standing in the way of my execution.
(SIGHING) I should've seen this coming.
I have no excuse for myself.
What about Henderson?
Is she still alive inside that thing?
Oh, your friend is fine.
I never could've fallen for her if her soul wasn't human.
I can smell my own kind a mile away.
What kind is that?
My world.
Hyberion.
Eleven million light-years from Earth.
Heretofore unobserved in your grand scheme of the universe.
Yeah, I'm getting a grand scheme here myself.
How do we know the other one's an assassin?
You're the one who's been hiding out on our planet.
Maybe the other guy's a bounty hunter, the law or something, or whatever you have on your planet.
The good professor here is a fugitive from justice.
A fugitive.
That's a good word for me.
You're a criminal?
In my world, yes, I guess I am.
Hyberion is a planet of conquest, forever at war with itself and those around it.
My teachings in tolerance and anti-expansion branded me a traitor, for which I was sentenced to death.
I implanted my embryo and took off for a new world.
Bringing us your trouble.
Hopefully, I've brought you more than that.
This one who's after me is a Stormer.
Not overly bright, but damn good at his work.
Hyberion will only know that your planet is peopled, and therefore conquerable, if he's successful in returning with my head.
What happened to the boy, Tobias?
I am as you've always known me, my friend.
Tobias LeConte, son of Atole and Phyllis LeConte.
Naturalists, researching the Serengeti with their infant son, when a great ball of fire fell to Earth, blinding the young LeConte.
Exposure to the comet would later develop as cancer, which having a natural immunity, I was able to fight off.
In some respects, I gave that child a life he never would have had.
What about our friend?
She's imprisoned until my assassin releases her.
So we can't kill it without killing her.
Or hand you over to this Stormer without leaving ourselves open to attack.
I'm very sorry about your friend.
It was never my intention to bring trouble to this planet.
There's got to be something we can do.
As I said, it isn't very smart.
And it only wants one thing.
Can I help you?
Yes.
I'm looking for Professor LeConte.
The Professor is in the second floor lecture hall.
I believe I saw him there earlier.
Thank you.
(IN ALIEN VOICE) Where is he?
The Professor lives here now.
He no longer lives by your rules.
This isn't your fight.
This one is dead if you don't take me to him now.
What's going on?
Sir, please.
I know you're just doing your job, but let us handle this ourselves.
Drop your weapon and release him.
Please, trust me!
I said, drop it!
Thank God you're all so stupid.
Can't you guys ever leave something behind for a person to study?
I think I might have something better for you, my friend.
The mechanics of it were actually quite simple.
Figuring out a way to create dominant absolute matter to fuel the thing was another matter.
(CHUCKLING) So to speak.
You don't like it?
Like it?
It's incredible.
How did you achieve absolute mass?
More important, why'd you let me spin my wheels all these years when you had it all along?
Why, my friend?
So you could run off and get yourself lost, or worse, killed?
Never to be heard from again?
No.
I like you too much, Scottie.
I like your planet, I like its people.
But you've got a lot to learn about the power of interstellar travel, and plenty of time to learn it.
My teacher and my tormentor till the very end.
Couldn't persuade you to stay, huh?
I'd love to, Nathan.
But it's only a matter of time before they find me again.
It's better this way.
Exactly where will you go?
I mean...
You mean, how will I see to get there?
Actually, I was kind of hoping you'd drive, Scott.
Come with me, my friend.
Let's go in search of other worlds.
Experience for ourselves all those places we argued about over so many pitchers of beer.
Lucas, is he gone or is he thinking it over?
He's thinking it over.
There's nothing to think about.
This is what I've dreamed of my whole life.
Only my family and my good friends could ever tolerate my long absences.
I hope you'll understand this one, too.
You know, Lucas,
I never realized this till now how similar you are to Tobias.
Are you sure you're not from outer space?
Hey, you guys take care of each other.
Yeah.
Thank you.
I wonder if he'll come back.
Depends on what he finds out there.
I hope he comes back.
Me, too.
You have any idea how to get out of here?
None whatsoever.
Well, every journey begins with one small step.
What the hell.
Let's go.
Hi, I'm Marco Sanchez, and surrounding me are not snakes, but fish.
The legendary moray eel.
Once considered sacred, the early Egyptians believed morays to be mystical, and ancient Romans even sacrificed slaves to them.
Long a nightmare to divers, we know now that the morays gaping smile to be a necessary breathing technique.
Though common throughout all oceans, morays are rarely seen outside their caves, emerging only at night to feed on their favorite foods, lobster and octopus.
See you on the next adventure of seaQuest.
COMPUTER:
Please wait for full stop.
Sea Deck.
Thank you for riding Mag-Lev.
Hello?
(GASPS)
Darwin.
I was told there was a medical emergency in here.
No.
No, emergency.
Darwin wants to talk to Wendy.
Is it just me, or are you behaving more strangely than usual, hmm?
No.
Darwin just wants to say...
ALL:
Surprise!
(ALL CLAPPING)
(ALL CHATTERING)
You look really surprised!
We did it!
Oh, wow!
Oh, thank you.
Happy birthday, Wendy.
I didn't have any real ones.
Oh, Dagwood, thank you.
These are much better than real flowers.
Thank you.
LUCAS:
Didn't you know?
Didn't you...
Didn't you sense we were planning a party?
No?
No, of course not.
You know I don't scan anybody's thoughts without their consent.
Well, in that case, we need to tell you what we've been thinking out loud.
On behalf of the officers and crew of seaQuest,
I have been requested to give a very long speech so that they'll have time to prepare the refreshments.
(ALL CHEERING)
MAN:
Good stuff.
NATHAN:
Here we are.
Happy birthday, Wendy.
Wendy?
What was that?
What was what?
(GASPING)
Wendy, what is it?
(GROANING)
What's happened?
Did you sense something?
Well, stand back, stand back, everybody stand back.
Give her some air.
It felt like a psychic power entering the world, a thousand times more profound than anything I've ever felt before.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Will the Security Committee please come to order?
Section Seven has something important to bring to our attention.
General Reed.
Yes.
(SNEEZES)
Oh, something's happening!
(MENACING LAUGHTER)
You think you can stop me?
You think you can plot against me and survive?
I am the Avatar of your dreams.
I am your beginning and your end.
You have tortured me and mine for many a year, and now your time has come.
Your sins shall be avenged.
Join me in hell!
Get a medic!
(WOMEN CHATTERING)
Captain Bridger and staff to see the Secretary General.
He'll see you in just a minute.
MAN ON PA:
Naval operation meeting scheduled for 0900 hours has been postponed until 1300 hours.
Why is everyone staring at us?
They know she's a Spyer.
A what?
A psychic.
Someone who can spy on your mind.
They're afraid.
They're afraid.
There have been at least five attacks in the past two days.
He always calls himself the Avatar.
Apparently it's some sort of Hindu name.
It means a god who appears as a man.
Especially a god who is the destroyer or rebuilder of worlds.
NATHAN:
And all the victims end up in comas?
MCGATH:
Yes.
It's as though their conscious minds have been erased.
The press is calling them psychic assassinations.
This can't be the work of a psychic.
I mean, part of what makes us psychic is the empathy we feel for other people.
I mean, to cause this much terror would torture a psychic doing it.
MCGATH:
We don't even know where these powers come from.
All that we know is that since the late 1990s, people of psychic power have been growing more numerous and more dangerous.
Dangerous?
That's absurd.
I know that you would never harm anyone.
I couldn't if I wanted to.
All I can do is scan conscious thoughts, and maybe bend a spoon if I really have my concentration.
That's all any psychic I've ever met can do.
MCGATH:
Not anymore.
You should have seen what happened here.
He was obviously a psychic, and he sure as hell was after us.
And we have got to stop this Avatar now.
And how do you propose to do that?
I ordered you to come directly from seaQuest so you wouldn't hear the news, because I wanted to assure you it does not apply to you.
Oh, boy, here it comes.
The Security Committee has asked all known psychics to report to Camp Arnold for internment.
They will be tranquilized with drugs known to suppress psionic powers until the crisis is resolved.
You can't do this.
It's against civil rights.
It's like interring the Japanese in World War II.
We're fighting for our lives here.
And it's not just the UEO.
The non-member states are doing it as well.
FORD:
Oh, man, this stinks.
But I wanted to assure you,
I wanted you to know, that the order does not apply to psychics with UEO security classifications, and that includes you.
Why?
Because you're hoping I can help you?
You sensed his power.
Only briefly, but you sensed it, and that is more than anyone else has been able to do.
If you want the roundup to stop, help us catch him while there is still time.
I'll need all the information that you have.
I'll meet you at the guest house this afternoon.
And, please, work as quickly as you can, for your sake as well as mine.
(PANTING)
MAN:
Good boy!
Come on!
WOMAN:
Great.
(LAUGHS)
I want to check up at the house.
Come on.
Here, boy.
Come on, buddy!
Come on!
Come on, boy, come on.
Come on.
WENDY:
"UEO rounds up Spyers."
You know, from the time we were kids, we've dreaded that the day would come that people's fear of psychics would turn into rage, and now it has.
Well, people are always afraid of what they don't understand.
I don't even understand it myself.
All I know is I've always felt like a freak.
Please.
You're not a freak.
You know how they discovered I had powers?
I was eight years old, and I was scoring perfectly in my spelling tests.
But then they started testing me with nonsense words, and I got all those right, too, because I was reading the answers right out of their minds.
And once they realized what was happening,
I could also read their fear.
And their repulsion.
There's a poem by Edgar Allan Poe that could have been written by a psychic.
"From childhood's hour I have not been
"As others were
"I have not seen As others saw
"I could not bring My passions from a common spring.
"From the same source I have not taken
"My sorrow, I could not awaken
"My heart to joy at the same tone
"And all I loved, I loved alone."
Wendy, have you taken a look at our crew lately?
Lucas, technological genius.
Darwin, a dolphin who'd rather live with humans.
Piccolo has gills.
Every one of us, a stranger, alone.
WOMAN ON PA:
Captain, the Secretary General has arrived.
Thank you.
We'll be right there.
You ready?
Yeah.
What is it?
Oh, I just feel strange.
(GASPS)
I don't want this!
What's happening?
I think there's an energy flow entering the building, and because I'm sensitive, I'm able to rechannel it.
It has to be the Avatar.
It wants McGath.
Come on!
Get Commander Ford.
It's happening again.
McGath!
I warned you not to try and stop me.
You think your puny friends with their tiny little powers could ever hold me back?
No!
Get out of my way.
(SHOUTS)
Join me in hell!
(THUD)
(DOOR OPENS)
Secure the room.
Look out, it's a Spyer!
Stop her!
Take the left!
You, follow me!
(DOG BARKING)
MANHEIM:
Move, move, move!
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
Let go.
Let go!
That Spyer attacked McGath.
The hell she did!
Maybe she's taken control of your mind, Captain, but she hasn't taken control of mine.
I know what I saw, and I'm issuing a warrant for her arrest.
Move out!
Wendy.
Professor Bingham.
I was hoping you would come.
Has the UEO been here?
Oh, yes.
All day.
But I think they finally gave up on me.
So they told you what's happening.
Oh, in great detail.
Inaccurate detail, perhaps.
Frightened detail, certainly.
But detail, for sure.
And?
I couldn't help them.
When I was growing up, after my time in the institute convinced me that nobody but ourselves would ever understand us, you changed my life.
You're not a psychic, but you could talk to me better than any psychic could because you weren't confused by my conscious mind, you were reading my heart.
You give me more credit than I deserve.
You were frightened, but very honest.
All I had to do was listen.
You understand us better than we understand ourselves.
You must have an idea who's doing this.
No psychic I've ever met, that's for sure.
Psychics are perfectly normal people.
They even commit crimes.
But not ones involving this much fear and suffering.
And yet, I saw an attack happen.
I mean, except for its enormous power, it felt exactly like a psychic projection.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Then it's obvious, isn't it?
There's been an artificial intervention.
What do you mean?
This psychic, this Avatar, as the UEO has been calling him, isn't really there, just his image is.
If he isn't feeling his victim's terror, that means all that's projecting is his telekinetic powers, his ability to manipulate objects and energy, but not his empathy.
So you think something's amplifying the one power, but not the rest.
It has to be.
I mean, my God, Wendy, maybe he's not naturally psychic at all.
You were researching this years ago, weren't you?
The purpose of my research was to create a device that would give normal people psychic powers.
Then there wouldn't be any difference between them and natural psychics.
And the fear, the persecutions that's happening now would never occur.
But I failed.
You're holding something back.
Oh, Wendy, please.
Professor, too many lives depend on this.
You have to tell me what happened.
I fashioned a device, a crude device that did amplify psychic powers.
But it only worked for people who already had those powers.
Can you imagine the fear normal people would have had if this had become known?
Well, is it possible that the Avatar has this device?
Oh, no, no, no.
It was far too dangerous, and the energy drain could destroy the mind of the person who wears it.
I had to destroy it.
Oh, no, you couldn't have.
Not after that much work.
I know you're trying to protect me, Professor, but you have to give me this device.
(RUMBLING)
BINGHAM:
Wendy!
Tell me who you are.
What do you want?
I am the Avatar of your dreams, and I've come for you.
Why?
In all the world, you're my only opponent of power, and yet your eyes are filled with kindness.
I followed your energies across the city, and I'll follow them across the planet if I must.
Come to me.
Join with me.
Tell me where you are.
Let me see you as a person.
(SIGHS)
I am everywhere and nowhere.
I am the Avatar of your dreams.
Join with me.
Merge with me.
This isn't the way.
Let me see you as a person.
Tell me where you really are.
My powers are growing by the hour.
Mankind has turned against us.
Once you turn against mankind, you'll see me with new eyes.
I got to get out of here.
No, Wendy, wait!
You don't know what you're facing!
Wendy!
Wendy!
(SIRENS WAILING)
It's okay, it's us, it's us!
How'd you guys find me?
Well, the computer said you'd done your advanced training here, so we figured it was our best shot.
We were on our way when the report about the Avatar came in.
If there's been a report, then Section Seven's gonna be here any minute.
I've gotta go.
Wendy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do you know where you're going?
Yeah, I got an image from the Avatar's mind.
It's enough for me to find him.
Well, we're going with you, then, Wendy.
No!
I can't protect you.
Would you just wait a second, Wendy?
LUCAS:
Wendy!
Wendy!
(BEEPING)
LUCAS:
Come on!
(WHOOSHING)
She's taken a shuttle.
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
I got Commander Ford on Tac One, sir.
I hope you've got good news.
FORD:
All depends on how you look at it.
We found her, but she ran.
She took a university shuttle craft.
Are you tracking anything?
Got a shuttle bearing off the port bow at 27 degrees.
That's gotta be from the university.
Plot an interception course.
Jonathan, where are you?
We're in a Sea Speeder, heading out from Fort Gore.
Good.
See if you can catch her.
Put her on the screen.
Got her on Tac Two, sir.
NATHAN:
Wendy, what do you think you're doing in that shuttle?
Are you going to let us help you?
I want to know what your heading is right now.
I can't draw you into this.
How fast do you think you're going to go in that thing?
We could overhaul you in a matter of minutes.
I think I know where the Avatar is.
If I can take him by surprise, maybe I can defeat him.
Seeing seaQuest would be too big a tip-off.
You've gotta think this through.
If you take the Avatar on one-on-one, he's going to be more powerful in person.
Well, that's all the more reason for me to slip in by surprise, and all the more reason for me not to risk your lives.
(WEND Y EXCLAIMS)
Out.
Lucas, you got a course projection on her?
Yeah, but it doesn't make much sense because it looks like she's heading towards the Aleph Colony.
The welfare colony?
Yeah, only the government's sending medical cases to it now.
A private company tries to make a profit by having the able-bodied patients care for the chronic cases.
Why would the Avatar choose to stay in a place like that?
I don't know, but we're gonna find out.
Jonathan, keep a close tail on Wendy, but not too close.
She may be right.
We'll give her as much support as possible, but try not to tip him off.
Captain, I've got Colonel Manheim on a secured link from Section Seven.
Let's put him on all the screens.
I may need witnesses for this.
Bridger, where the hell are you?
I don't think I should tell you.
You don't understand.
We've got a situation developing here.
A situation?
General Reed was responsible for security at all of our fusion power sites.
Apparently when the Avatar attacked him, he also accessed his knowledge of the reactors.
Now they're going out of control, one by one.
We're nearing a meltdown outside some very major population centers.
All right, listen, here's what I think you need to do.
I think you have to stop rounding up all the psychics.
I think you have to ask them to help you shield your reactor sites.
Maybe with their combined power, you might stand a chance.
And what makes you think they'd help us now?
Because in my experience, they're a hell of a lot more humane than most people I know.
I know they would do anything to help.
And in the meantime, we're going to try and get to the bottom of this.
Bridger out.
All right, people, we're going to have to risk going in hard and fast.
O'Neill, warn Commander Ford and sound general quarters.
Aye-aye, sir.
General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.
General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.
NATHAN ON RADIO:
Wendy, things have changed now.
The Avatar has started to attack reactor sites.
Well, it doesn't change what I have to do.
Yes, it does.
I've got Ford's team following you.
They're going in with you, and we're following right behind.
Okay, but it doesn't really matter.
I'm almost there.
TIMO THY:
Captain, I'm picking up what looks like fire-control sensors dead ahead.
Arm weapons.
Ready countermeasures.
Aye-aye, sir.
Ortiz, what do you see?
MIGUEL:
Looks like the colony's armed.
Mark 12 point defense systems.
But we aren't picking up any communications from the colony.
Doesn't matter.
Mark 12s are designed to fire even if they're unmanned.
And they are.
Launch warning, launch warning.
Torpedoes in the water.
Hope you ate a light lunch.
Wendy, break off.
You're being fired on.
Full ahead emergency.
Weapons free.
Countermeasures now.
Aye-aye.
Intercepts and decoys away.
Torpedoes away!
MIGUEL:
Target, target!
Torpedoes in her wake!
Steer for us!
Head towards the countermeasures.
I'm trying!
They're still on her tail.
All right, on my mark, pull up.
Okay, I'm ready, but I'm running out of room.
Intercepts in range in five, in four, in three...
Pull up now!
TIMO THY:
One!
Contact!
We got them.
We got them.
How's our run?
Going in.
COMPUTER:
Impact verified.
Yes!
Target's destroyed.
Approach lanes open, sir.
You okay?
Yes.
Thank you.
Bring her in, Jonathan.
FORD:
Okay, Wendy, we're getting the biggest concentration of energy from the docking port near the top.
So, here we go.
Oh, my God.
Is he...
No, he's in a coma.
Just like the UEO officials up-world, and just like the patients here.
What is this place?
This is a chronic care ward where they pack off coma patients to vegetate.
Okay, fan out and reconnoiter.
Steady now.
Be ready for anything.
How about to run?
(MACHINES BEEPING)
Commander Ford!
Team, over here.
It's him.
It's the Avatar.
LONNIE:
You mean, he's unconscious?
He's a coma patient himself?
FORD:
Charles Ross.
Injured in a car accident.
He was working on a degree in Asian Studies while interning at UEO Headquarters.
He met all those people.
This is why his victims aren't dead.
He meant it when he said, "Join me in hell."
How could he be doing anything?
WENDY:
He's dreaming.
I don't think he even knows what he's doing is real.
He has critical pathway damage.
A normal patient, this would have killed them, but because he has psychic powers.
He's found another way to stay alive.
Okay, so these are neural pathways that sustain consciousness.
WENDY:
Yes.
They were destroyed by his head injury.
He's been growing an alternative path.
Inside his brain, his psychic energy, his soul, has been trying to heal.
I mean, they could have helped him, but instead, they've been experimenting on him to try and find out how he's doing it.
And somehow they've just unleashed his powers.
All his energies are focused up-world.
He doesn't even know we're here.
I could shoot him and end it all.
You could do that?
No.
Not if there's another way.
Well, maybe there is.
I'm going to try and stop him dreaming until I can get him to an AutoDock.
Can I have your injector, Henderson?
(MACHINE BEEPING FASTER)
Wendy, his base rates are climbing.
Look out!
Who are you?
Why are you attacking me?
We're trying to help you.
Like all the other torturers?
What harm have I ever done to you?
Why are you trying to kill me?
Your end has come!
No!
What was that?
Felt like we hit something.
The sensors don't show anything.
Captain, something weird's going on here.
Every computer in the boat's going on-line.
All right, go to manual.
Shut them down.
I can't.
The circuits are welded shut!
Look out!
Look out, Captain!
(SHOUTS)
(ALARM SOUNDING)
The boat's sinking by the bow!
We haven't lost her yet.
Blow all ballasts!
(GROANS)
You think you can stop me?
You think you have the power?
You can't even shield your friends.
Okay, then, I'll join you instead.
What?
You want me?
You've got me.
(GROANS)
LUCAS:
Wendy.
Wendy.
Oh, God.
FORD:
Do something.
Do something!
(PIANO PLAYING)
Who are you?
I'm Wendy Smith.
I'm a medical doctor, and a psychic, like yourself.
I don't know what you're talking about.
(STAMMERING) How did you get in here?
I entered your mind.
We're inside your psyche, in a dream state.
You've been trapped in here.
Get away from me.
I've seen you in my dreams.
You're with the torturers.
You're here to hurt me.
I understand what happened to you.
They experimented on you instead of treating you.
But I'm here to help.
Don't touch me!
I found...
I found the fire.
The source.
Nobody can hurt me ever again.
Charlie, you can't surrender to that power.
We're not ready for it.
It would destroy your world.
It's already gone.
Everyone's dead.
I was driving to work, suddenly a truck was veering into my lane, and when I woke up, the world was gone.
Except for the pain.
I mean, you aren't even real.
You're just a...
A nightmare, like the rest.
You're wrong.
Everything you think is a dream is real.
The monster you unleashed in your nightmares, the Avatar, he's stalking the planet while you sleep.
And this room which you think is all that's left of the real world, this is a dream.
You're trapped in a coma, in a bed, in the back ward of the Aleph Colony.
But I can help you.
No!
No!
I am the Avatar.
I cannot be destroyed and I will rebuild the world!
It isn't working!
The computers are venting the reserve!
NATHAN:
Pull up, pull up!
All thrusters on lift!
Nothing's working!
FORD:
Do something!
I'm trying, but I don't know how.
I've never been cross-trained in anything like this.
COMPUTER:
Code One.
Vital signs have fallen below acceptable limits.
All I know is she's dying.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)
Leave me alone!
Go back to the abyss or die.
You're afraid.
I am not afraid.
You have to be.
Fear grows out of loneliness, and no one's ever been more alone than you.
But we can bridge it.
We can escape from here.
No, you're trying to trick me.
You're gonna take away my powers, and then you're gonna leave me trapped here forever.
I'll kill you first.
You've never killed before.
Not even in your dreams.
You won't do it now.
You've...
You've let down your shield.
Do what you want.
But first, remember this.
My name is Wendy Smith, and in your dreams you begged for me to join you because you said I had gentle eyes.
I'm real, Charlie.
The world still exists beyond this nightmare.
Now, if you take my hand, maybe I can lead you there.
What if it's a trick?
Better to take that chance than to risk loneliness here forever.
Take my hand, Charlie.
Take it.
It's okay.
You see that light?
That's your consciousness.
That's the real world.
I'll fall.
No, there are steps.
You're building them.
I saw the pathway on your scan.
You just have to believe that they're there.
Come on.
Come on.
(GASPS)
We're losing her!
Help me.
Come back to us!
Fight it!
I'm sorry.
I'm too weak.
I can't do it for you.
I can't do it.
You're the only one that can.
This is your pathway, Charlie.
You have to build it yourself.
(GASPING)
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, Wendy, don't leave us!
(RUMBLING)
(GASPS)
Get it off her!
(PANTING)
(COMPUTERS BEEPING)
What's happening?
The computers are rebooting.
We've got power, sir.
Steady as she goes.
Steady as she goes.
Captain, I've got Colonel Manheim.
Let's see him.
Bridger, what did you do?
Our reactors are stabilizing, and the hospital reports people are coming out of their comas.
I'm not exactly sure.
But one thing I do know is you're going to owe Dr. Smith a very large apology.
Can I touch him?
Yeah, yeah.
(BOTH CHATTERING)
How's he doing?
He's doing very well.
He's lost all his powers.
And the odd this is, he doesn't remember anything that happened.
Well, at least the UEO has a better memory than that.
They were so embarrassed by the number of psychics that showed up to defend their sites, that they've not only released them, but offered apologies and compensation.
I think it's over.
Well, not until Bingham's amplifier is destroyed.
Well, it's in the reactor stream now.
On screen, please.
(SCREEN BEEPING)
Watch your eyes.
Thank you.
Hey, Wendy.
Come on, come on.
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
WENDY:
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, Wendy,
I didn't know there was going to be a second party, and I ate some cake.
Oh, that's all right, Dagwood.
(ALL CHATTERING)
Hi, I'm Edward Kerr.
The tigers of the sea, torpedoes with teeth, terrors of the deep, are all names given to this fish, the great barracuda.
With lightning reflexes and a slender form, this tropical fish finds squid and smaller fish easy prey.
Barracudas can grow six feet, and can swim up to 28 miles per hour, and with dozens of enormous teeth, look meaner than most sharks.
But like sharks, attacks on humans are rare, and often the barracuda is simply mistaking a flash of jewelry as a fish.
See you on the next adventure of seaQuest.

You're in for a scare.

[ Boy] Previously on Goosebumps.
No one's ever gonna find us out here.
- Quit being such a baby.
- Hey, keep cool, you guys.
- [ Roaring ] - [ All Scream ]
Hi.
I'm Uncle Al, the camp director.
My parents checked out a whole lot of camps.
Nightmoon's supposed to be the best.
- My name's Dawn.
- I'm Billy.
Welcome to Camp Nightmoon.
You guys follow my rules, and you're gonna have the best time of your lives.
- What's that, Uncle Al?
- The forbidden bunk.
Why is it called the forbidden bunk?
Because it's forbidden.
So stay clear!
Snake!
It bit me!
I wanna see the nurse.
What nurse?
- There's no nurse?
- No!
What do you think, Uncle Al runs a camp for wimps?
I promise you, the swelling and the pain will be gone by morning.
- Really?
- Trust me.
Where's Mike?
Mike's not here, Billy.
So I guess maybe he's somewhere else.
- [ Ball Strikes Helmet ] - [ Groans ]
- Billy!
- Jay!
It tore Roger.
It tore Roger to pieces!
- Sabre's coming.
- Come on, man.
We gotta go!
Sabre's hungry.
- He had claws and teeth!
- [ Whimpering ]
[ Roaring ]
[ Both Scream ]
[ Roaring Continues ]
[ Larry] What are you guys doing out of your tents?
- Larry?
- Who'd you think, whiner?
- Close the door!
- What for, scared of mosquitoes?
- What's your problem?
- Sabre's out there!
- It got Roger.
Jay was there!
- Up at the forbidden bunk, man!
You guys went to the forbidden bunk?
That's totally against the rules!
- It got Roger!
- Everyone was screaming.
Shut up.
Real sick joke, guys, but save it for talent night.
You don't believe us?
First off, you shouldn't have left your tents.
It was Sabre, Larry!
You think I'm making this up?
And second, you shouldn't have gone to the forbidden bunk.
Wait till I tell Uncle Al.
He is gonna kill you.
I can't believe he thinks we're lying.
- What do we do now?
- [ Roaring ]
Did you hear that?
- Oh, we gotta get help.
- [ Jay] Are you crazy?
No one's going anywhere.
There's nothing we can do anyways.
It's gonna be light soon.
- We'll take turns watching the door.
- Okay.
Who's first?
My head's killing me.
All right, you get some sleep.
I'll take the first watch.
Okay.
[ Roaring ]
[ Roaring Continues ]
Guys.
- What's going on?
- What time is it?
It's day, finally.
- They probably found Roger by now.
- Or what's left of him.
Come on.
We gotta find Uncle Al and tell him what happened.
Let's go.
[ Chattering ]
- Where's Uncle Al?
- Take a breath, Billy.
- We gotta talk to him.
- You guys get your beauty sleep?
Where is Uncle Al?
You got something to say, you say it to me.
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- Why?
Because you don't believe us about Roger.
I don't even know the guy.
All we wanna do is talk to Uncle Al, okay?
- Uncle Al's not here.
- Well, where is he?
None of your business!
I'm in charge.
You got that?
Now get your bathing suits on, losers.
You're going to the lake.
[ Jay ] Why is it just us?
Why doesn't anybody else think anything happened?
[ Billy ] I gotta find a phone, call my parents.
Tell them to come pick me up and get me out of this hole.
Maybe camp will start to get fun.
My head sure feels better.
Forget your head.
What about Mike and Roger?
Maybe their bodies are rotting away in the forbidden bunk right now.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I don't know, Colin.
What are you gonna do about it?
Hey, come on, you guys.
- I'll meet you at the lake.
- Where are you going?
I'll meet you at the lake.
[ Sighs ]
What are you doing, Billy?
- Uh, I was just trying to make a call.
- To your parents.
Just to say hi.
[ Laughing ]
Well, that's not gonna be much use, is it?
I put it up as a joke.
- Where's the real phone?
- Oh, no, that's just it.
There is no real phone.
They're not gonna put a line way up here.
We're miles from anywhere.
Are you homesick, Billy?
Yeah, I guess.
That's why I tell you to write the letters home.
Have you been doing that?
- Twice a day.
- Good.
Good boy.
It'll make you feel better.
Now, where are you supposed to be right now?
- At the lake.
- You'll love it down there.
You go down and join your bunkmates.
Have yourself some fun.
Okay?
Uncle Al, did Larry talk to you about Roger?
Yeah, he did.
I checked the files.
There is no camper up here named Roger.
No first name, no middle name.
No Roger.
Well, that's not true.
I mean, I know Roger.
He was in my bunk.
Get to the lake, Billy.
Guys!
Jay!
Colin!
Hey, Billy, get a paddle and swim on out!
It's great!
- Uncle Al says there's no Roger.
- [ Colin ] What?
- No Roger!
- What?
[ Whistle Blows ]
Get back in here, you guys!
You gotta put on life jackets!
- Ah, we're fine.
- Paddle it in now.
- Put this on.
- This doesn't fit.
Just tie it on or something.
Put this on.
[ Together ] Whoa!
- Man, you guys are hopeless!
- Larry, I'm not a good swimmer!
You don't have to be, you jerk.
The life jacket.
- Help!
- He's fakin' it.
Colin, hang on to the canoe.
- Don't panic!
- Help!
I'll get him.
Man, I'm goin' in.
What are you talking about?
You wanna go under too?
- Larry.
- No.
- Larry!
- No.
- I was never here.
- Larry!
- I never saw any of this.
- You can't just leave 'em out here!
I was back at the lodge.
Larry!
Help!
Larry!
Uncle Al!
Jay!
Colin!
Come on, you guys!
Don't do this.
[ Panting ]
[ Growling ]
[ Roaring ]

Hello?

What is going on?
Get it together, Billy.
Get it together!
Think.

[ Wind Howling ]
[ Mike's Voice ] Dear Mom and Dad.
I'm homesick already.
There's nothing up here but rocks and trees.
The air smells funny, and they don't even have cable TV.
[ Roger's Voice ] Dear Dad.
The weather is here.
Wish you were beautiful.
[ Think:

- Billy.
- Dawn?
- You okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to escape.
- You are?
- Yeah.
- How come?
'Cause Camp Nightmoon's a nightmare, that's how come.
It's evil, Billy.
That's why I ran away.
Guys are dropping like flies-- snakebites, creature attacks, drownings.
- Remember Dori?
- The girl you came with.
Yeah.
We went on a hike and she got mauled by this bear.
But our counselor said it was nothing and made her walk back to camp.
Dori cried all night.
We tried to help because there was no nurse.
We finally got to sleep.
But when we woke up,
Dori was gone.
That's the same thing at the boys' camp.
[ Banging ]
What's that?
I wrote this the first day I came.
Some of them are from years ago.
[ Whistle Blows ]
This is weird.
Maybe they're looking for you.
- You think so?
- Maybe for me.
I don't want them to find me, Billy.
I'll go see what's going on.
I'll meet you back here after lights-out.
- Come back soon.
- I will.
Promise.
Come on.
Line up.
Two rows.
Hustle up.
What is wrong with you, boys?
I said hustle!
Look who I found, Uncle Al!
[ Billy ] Larry!
- [ Uncle Al ] Where have you been, Billy?
- At the lake.
Where Jay and Colin drowned and Larry did nothing to help!
- And you were-
- And you were nowhere!
- Get in line, Billy.
And now Mike and Roger and Colin and Jay are all--
That's enough!
This is not the time.
You get in line, Billy, now!
Larry.
George.
Hand them out.
One weapon per boy.
- What is this?
- Shut up, Billy.
We have a runaway reported from the girls' camp.
She's brunette.
Average height.
We suspect she's close by-- in the woods, possibly on campgrounds.
Search everywhere.
Aim carefully.
We do not want her getting away.
- What?
- [ Larry ] I said shut up, Billy.
Are you saying we're supposed to shoot her?
That's what I said, Billy.
- She broke the big rule.
- This is insane.
- You can't just go killing people.
- Killing?
Who said anything about killing?
These weapons are loaded with tranquilizer darts.
We wanna stop the girl, not kill her.
Or do you have a problem with that, Billy?
Do you have a problem?
I won't do it.
Is this any way for my number one camper to be acting?
Camp's over.
Nobody else is gonna die.
Die?
Nobody has died here, Billy.
This is a summer camp.
You're a liar!
What about Mike's snakebite, uh, Sabre eating Roger, Jay and Colin drowning?
Mike?
Jay?
Colin?
We have no campers by those names.
Liar!
You're a liar!
Calm down, Billy.
I think I know what's going on here.
Larry, do we have any boys with those names?
- Never heard of 'em.
- George?
- Nope.
- Now, listen to me, Billy.
Sometimes if you get too homesick, you begin imagining things, seeing things.
No way.
Put down that weapon, Billy, or you are gonna be very, very sorry.
- No, I'm not.
- Put it down, Billy!
Now!
[ Screams ]
Congratulations, Billy.
[ Laughs ]
- He passed!
Billy passed!
- [ All Cheering ]
Way to go, Billy.
You did great.
Hey, you can all come out now.
He passed.
[ Laughs ]
Mom.
Dad.
What are you guys doing here?
I think I'm going crazy.
No, you're not, sweetheart.
I knew you'd pass.
Pass what?
Congratulations, Billy.
You passed a very difficult series of tests, Billy, and you passed with flying colors.
What are you guys talking about?
This is not a summer camp, Billy.
It's a government testing lab.
What about Jay and Colin?
We were under the canoe the whole time...
- in an air pocket.
- [ Laughs ]
And Mike?
I mean, that snakebite was nasty.
Rubber snake.
Had you going for a while, didn't I?
- And Roger?
- Hey, Billy.
All in one piece.
[ Laughs ] One piece!
Billy, listen.
Your father and I have been asked to lead... a key expedition to a very dangerous place.
We couldn't stand the thought of being away from you for so long, but government rules say we couldn't take you unless you passed certain tests.
- What tests?
- [ Uncle Al ] For quick thinking.
Like the way you figured out how to trap that snake.
And for courage.
Going out into the night while Sabre was on the loose.
Trying to protect your friends.
And trying to save us from drowning.
And believing in yourself when the whole camp was saying you were crazy.
You knew when to follow the rules and when to break them.
So, everybody was in on this?
Campers, counselors?
We're all actors, Billy, working at the lab.
You guys were amazing.
So amazing, I'm never setting' foot in another summer camp again.
- [ All Gasp ] - [ Growls ]
Say hello to Sabre, Billy.
Show him how it growls, George.
- [ Machine Revving ] - [ Growls ]
Oh, man.
I thought I was dead meat.
Better go get your things packed, Billy.
Expedition leaves first thing in the morning.
- Where we going?
- Very far away.
A place called Earth.
Research tells us the aliens there are pretty dangerous and, uh, unpredictable.
Hmph.
Bet you they're not as crazy as Larry and Uncle Al.
You never know, Billy.
You never know.

I don't want any ice cream.
I want my balloon.
We'll get you a balloon, OK?
No.
I want my balloon.
Fine.
We'll get you another balloon.
That was a waste of good money.

Ohh!

Teddy?

Teddy!
Teddy!
- There's a kid on the track!
- Oh, my God!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Get away from there!
Teddy!
Teddy, come here!
Damn!
Teddy!
Tell Teddy to get off the track!
No!
Oh, my God!
Teddy?
Maggie...
Teddy...
This was taken at an amusement park three months ago.
The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two.
- He was killed seconds after this was taken.
- How?
According to the police report, he wandered in front of the miniature train.
The conductor was unable to stop due to malfunctioning brakes.
Teddy's dad works for the State Department.
A coroner's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances of the accident.
- Did the inquest find anything unusual?
- No.
But the county medical examiner was disturbed by this case and by this photo and I think with good reason.
You see, this is a helium balloon.
One thing I learnt in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up.
- But this is moving away horizontally.
- Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?
The National Weather Service say on that day the wind was blowing north.
But the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.
- Pulled?
By whom?
- I don't know.
So I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging.
Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a photographic print.
Not details.
Information.
Watch the monitor.
We have limitations on how much the eye can perceive unaided.
But with this special software, which I designed, we can detect hidden information.
We can manipulate it, enhance it.
Now watch right here.
There it is.
It's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.
So you're saying that, uh...
a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?
Did anyone check the camera that took the photo?
- The lens or the pressure plate?
- It all checked out, Scully.
I think this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.
This is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree.
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.
To get on the tracks, Teddy Holvey escaped this childproof halter that his mom had tied to a sink.
- I've seen some slippery two-year-olds.
So the CME put it on his own two-year-old and found it was impossible for the kid to free himself.
So unless Teddy was the reincarnation of Houdini...
And that would be an X-File in itself.
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.
We're here apart from that investigation.
We believe something may have been overlooked.
Like what?
The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.
- Oh, my God.
- There were over a hundred witnesses.
We saw Teddy ourselves.
He was chasing a balloon.
There was no one else around.
It was an awful accident, but that's all it was-an accident.
Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?
He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?
I don't know what you're getting at.
We loved Teddy.
If you're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids, you're way out of line.
Mrs Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?
I already told the inquest I heard nothing.
Mrs Holvey, at the time of the accident did you have any hired help?
No.
My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening?
Things moved, odd objects appearing?
It's that damn smoke detector.
I'll be right back.
Does this happen often?
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.
(speaks Romanian)
- Mother.
- Diavolo!
Mother, it was just a false alarm.
No!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
Stop it!
What is she saying?
- Maggie!
- You marry a devil.
You have devil child!
I'm sorry.
D'you recognise this?
- It's a swastika.
- It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot.
It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck used by various cultures since the Middle Ages.
The child had one on the back of his hand last night.
My guess?
It was drawn by the old lady-to protect the boy.
- Yes, I saw her drawing it.
- You didn't think that was strange?
I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get but just not from ghosties or beasties.
Look at this.
Have you ever heard of Münchhausen by proxy?
Yeah, my grandfather used to take it for his stomach.
When a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status.
Look at Teddy's medical history.
You'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.
Projectile vomiting at three months diarrhoea at four months, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea...
Each time they were unable to determine the cause.
- And no one questioned this?
- The family moved around with Steve's job.
Records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital.
But this abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.
- He had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.
Often the perpetrator of Münchhausen by proxy will view the child as evil.
The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.
Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully?
Things have been strange since Golda, my mother-in-law, moved in with us.
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.
Golda forbade our marriage, said I was the devil.
After I transferred back to the US, things got somewhat better until Teddy was born and she came to live with us.
That's when the strangeness really started.
What kind of strangeness?
Superstitions rule Golda's life.
She'll spit if anyone compliments the kids.
Once she moved in, she poured hot water over the threshold to ward off demons tied red strings around the kids' wrists.
One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof.
Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick... a lot.
- And you suspect Golda?
- She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.
But at the same time she dotes on him like... she's afraid of him.
Afraid of him or for him?
I just don't know.
Are you familiar with Münchhausen by proxy?
Are you accusing us of child abuse?
Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.
I could never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.
This is gonna be hard.
- Maggie!
- What do they want?
To take Charlie away?
They just want him to talk with a social worker.
- They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.
You want to take him away!
You blame me for Teddy and you want to take him away.
I won't listen to this.
This is ridiculous!
If you wanna come, you can.
I'm taking Charlie now.
No, Steven!
- What was that?
- (speaks Romanian)
Come on, Charlie, let's get your coat.
- You have no right to do this!
- Maggie.
Come on.
We'll meet you out front.
- OK, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.
Dammit!
No!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Noooo!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Mulder.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You see this?
- Find anything?
- Yeah, maybe.
It looks like ash.
Yeah.
It's everywhere.
Look at this.
The Holveys said earlier they had problems with the wiring.
- It could be the motor shorted out.
- No, the motor's fine.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'll have this analysed.
Before we do anything, we should get Charlie out of here.
I called a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.
- The courts will be reluctant to intervene.
- Not when a child is in danger.
And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.
Really?
- Still think this is Münchhausen by proxy?
- Without a doubt.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
Stay away from our house!
- Hey.
You wanna see something weird?
- What?
Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holveys' house.
No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.
- What do you mean?
- It contains nothing organic or inorganic.
In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.
Oh, wow!
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to academia he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
- It's called vibuti.
Holy ash.
Technically it's called an apport - something that materialises out of thin air.
Wait a second.
Nothing materialises out of thin air.
You've read the Bible?
Remember Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
- In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.
Too bad you didn't take a picture and use your computer to see the entire Last Supper.
Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings or during bilocation which is a phenomenon where a person's energy is transported to a different location.
That energy could have been what set off the garage-door opener.
Yeah, that-or somebody activated the remote control.
Well, who are you suggesting did that?
Who was standing outside when the garage door opened on us yesterday?
The old lady... and Charlie.

Mrs Holvey?
My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the FBI.
I've been instructed to file a report for the court.
- May I come in?
- No.
- Please, I've already had enough trouble.
- I understand, Mrs Holvey.
But if you won't talk to me, I'll have to put that in the report and it could very well complicate your situation.
- Mommy!
- Charlie?
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
He's been sick.
My mother was supposed to be looking after him.
Mother?
Mother!
- (Golda speaks Romanian)
- Get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Get out!
I have had enough, Mother.
I want you out of my house.
(Golda speaks Romanian)
No!
Mother!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
The grandmother's taken the child and locked him in the room with her.
- She may have a knife.
I've called 911.
- What happened?
There were three strange men.
They were performing some kind of ritual.
No!
No, Nanna!
(speaks Romanian)
It is the only way.
No!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
Mother!
Mother!
- Did you talk to Charlie?
- He says he doesn't remember anything.
The coroner's preliminary report says she died of a heart attack.
But those wounds...
I'd swear her eyes were pecked out.
There was more ash on the floor beneath the old woman's body.
And look at this.
- What is it?
- It's mugwort.
I think it's a ceremonial herb.
- Was this a ritual killing?
- No, the reverse swastika on the window and the red string around his wrist are protective devices.
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.
But the old woman knew the family was in trouble.
Those men were here to help her.
I told you before, get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
I am not interested in your superstition.
Now get out.
Now!
- Mrs Holvey?
- It's all right.
- Who are they?
- They are the Calusari.
In Romania they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites.
What did he say?
He said it's not over.
- The evil is still here.
- Excuse me.
Sir?
Can I have a word with you?
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
You were trying to protect the family, weren't you?
You said there was still evil here.
Sir!
I can arrest you if I have to.
The evil that is here has always been.
It has gone by different names through history.
Cain, Lucifer, Hitler.
It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men.
If you try to stop us, the blood will be on your hands.
Mrs Holvey?
I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.
My mother used to say that evil follows evil.
Once someone suffers a misfortune, they'll always have bad luck.
I used to think that was just a superstition.
Now I don't know what to believe.
I blamed her, you know?
For all that's happened.
I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me.
Punish you for what?
For abandoning the old ways.
I was raised to believe, as she did, in spirits.
The unseen world.
When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.
Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.
She thought Charlie was responsible somehow.
How could he be responsible for all this horror?
He's just a little boy!
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.
Charlie?
I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you remember how you got there?
No.
Your mother said you were there.
Remember?
I wasn't there!
Many people saw you in the room.
It wasn't me!
I wasn't there!
It wasn't me!
- Who was in the room?
- No!
Was there someone else in the room?
No!
I didn't hurt her!
Charlie?
Charlie!
Who hurt your grandmother?
Charlie!
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie?
Who?
It was Michael!
Michael!
Mrs Holvey?
We never told him.
It was agreed upon.
It was our secret.
What secret, Mrs Holvey?
What are you talking about?
Michael.
He was Charlie's twin.
He was stillborn.
Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it.
My mother she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael's death - ...to divide their souls.
She said... if we didn't, the world of the dead would follow Charlie.
But it was just a superstition.
Help!
I need your help.
- Charlie?
- He's having some kind of seizure.
Don't restrain him.
Let's turn him on his side.
Charlie, you're going to be OK.
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting.
How's Mrs Holvey?
I'm amazed she hasn't broken down.
She's in the waiting room, trying to sleep.
The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure, but they're unable to determine the cause.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm Nurse Castor.
I'm just gonna give you something to help you sleep.
- No, I don't want a shot!
- I know, but if you spit out your medicine we have to give it to you some other way.
- No!
Just relax.
It won't hurt.
Afterwards I'll give you a sticker.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch.
- Now I want you to relax.
- Stop it!
- Charlie...
Now, I want you to behave.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, I want you to behave.
Just relax.
- No!
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
No, Michael!
Michael, don't!
Mommy?
- I want to go home now.
- Charlie?
What are you doing up?
Why are you dressed?
They said I could go home now.
- Who said that?
- The doctors.
They said I could leave.
All right, then.
Let's just get your coat.
- And we'll talk to the doctors.
- No, Mommy.
Let's just go home.
Now!
OK, Charlie.
We'll go straight home.
What are you looking at?
- Is that Mrs Holvey?
- Where?
There.
I think she's got Charlie with her.
Ohh...
Oh.
Nurse!
- Are you all right?
- He hit me.
- Who?
Charlie?
- No, not him.
The other one.
There were two of them.
Two boys.
- You gotta get to Mrs Holvey.
- Why?
The boy who left with Mrs Holvey wasn't Charlie.
- Are you saying she left with a ghost?
- Or a spirit.
I'm not sure.
It's what was in the photo and what the old woman tried to protect the family from.
It's killed three people.
You've got to get to Mrs Holvey's before it happens again.
- What are you gonna do?
- Get help.
- There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?
No, dear.
I'm not hungry.
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes.
Sure.
Can I have a balloon?
Uh-huh.
Can we ride the train, Mommy?
Now, you finish up and Mommy will be right back, OK?
(speaks Romanian)
Please God, don't let it be true.
What are you doing, Mommy?
- (chants in Romanian)
- Mommy?
Guard the door.
Mrs Holvey?
Hello?
(chanting in Romanian)
(cries out in Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Come hold him down.
Don't look at it!
Look away or it will recognise you.
(Maggie chants in Romanian)
Charlie?
Mommy?
(chants in Romanian)
(shouts in Romanian)
It hurts!
Do not let go!
He tricks you.
- Are you all right?
- Charlie?
Let the boy rest.
We must find the mother.
The boy needs her.
- Scully, are you all right?
- We're OK.
How's Charlie?
Charlie!
Hello, sweetie.
Charlie!
It is over... for now.
But you must be careful.
It knows you.
The case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved.
The boy, who celebrates his tenth birthday next month, is under the care of his mother.
Though I believe him to be innocent, I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari:
...that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil.

Ready?
There's a kid on the track!
Oh, my God!
Teddy!
Teddy, get away from there!
Teddy!
Get off the track!
No!
Oh, my God!
Teddy?
Oh, Maggie.
Teddy.
This photo was taken at an amusement park three months ago.
The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, age two.
- He was killed just seconds after this was taken.
- How?
According to the police report, he wandered onto the tracks of the miniature train.
The conductor was unable to stop due to a malfunction of the braking system.
Teddy's father works for the State Department, so a coroner's inquest was held... due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the accident.
And did the inquest come up with anything unusual?
No.
But the county medical examiner called me afterwards.
He was disturbed by this case and by this photograph.
And I think with good reason.
This is a helium balloon.
And one thing I did learn in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up, up and away, but this is moving away from him horizontally.
Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?
I called the National Weather Service, and they said... on the day Teddy died the wind was blowing north, but you see, the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.
Pulled?
By whom?
I don't know.
That's why I came to Chuck, the king of digital imagining.
Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a simple photographic print.
Not details.
Information.
Watch the monitor.
We have limitations on how much information the eye can perceive unaided.
But with this special software, which I designed, we can detect hidden information.
We can manipulate it, enhance it.
Watch right here.
There it is.
It's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.
So you're saying... that a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?
Has anyone checked the camera that took this photo?
The lens or pressure plate?
It all checked out.
I think from the information, this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.
This information is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo... with Jesus' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree.
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.
In order to get on those tracks, Teddy Holvey... had to escape this child-proof halter that his mother tied to a sink.
I've seen slippery two-year-olds.
So the C.M.E. Took it home and put it on his own two-year-old, and found out it was physically impossible for the kid to reach around and free himself.
So, unless Teddy Holvey was the reincarnation of Houdini...
And that would be an X-File in itself.
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.
We're here apart from that investigation.
We have reason to believe something may have been overlooked.
- Like what?
- The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.
Oh, my God.
There were over 100 witnesses.
We saw Teddy ourselves.
He was chasing a balloon.
There was no one else around.
It was an awful accident.
But that's all it was.
An accident.
Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?
He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?
I don't know what you're getting at.
We loved Teddy.
If you're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids in the lake, you're way out of line.
Mrs. Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom before Teddy disappeared?
I already told the inquest.
I heard nothing.
Mrs. Holvey, at the time of the accident, did you have any hired help?
No.
My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening around the house?
Things moved, odd objects appearing?
Anything like that?
It's that damn smoke detector!
I'll be right back.
Ah, does this happen often?
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.
Mother.
Mother, it was just a false alarm.
No!
Mother, stop it!
What is she saying?
Maggie!
You marry a devil.
You have devil child.
I'm sorry.
- You recognize this?
- Sure, it's a swastika.
It's also known as a gammadion or fylfot.
It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck.
It's been used by various cultures since the Middle Ages.
The Holvey's child had one on the back of his hand last night.
My guess it was drawn there by the old lady to protect the boy.
- I saw her drawing it.
- And you didn't think that was strange?
- I saw her drawing it.
- And you didn't think that was strange?
I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get.
But just not from ghosties or beasties.
Take a look at this.
Have you ever heard of Munchausen by proxy?
Yeah, my grandfather used to take that for his stomach.
It's when a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing medical symptoms, usually as a way of gaining attention or status.
If you look at Teddy Holvey's medical history, you'll see he was admitted to various hospitals... ten times during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.
Projectile vomiting at three months, diarrhea at four months, vomiting, diarrhea, diarrhea?
- Each time they were unable to determine the cause.
- And no one questioned this?
The family moved a lot because of Steve's job.
And records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital.
But this kind of abuse is not limited to just one child.
So I checked out Charlie's history as well.
- Charlie had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born.
Which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.
Often the perpetrator of Munchausen by proxy will view the child as evil.
The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.
Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully?
Things have been strange since Golda, my mother-in-law, moved in with us.
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.
Golda forbade our marriage.
Said I was the devil.
After I transferred back to the U.S., things got somewhat better, until Teddy was born and she came to live with us.
That's when the strangeness really started.
What kind of strangeness?
Superstitions rule Golda's life.
She'll spit when anyone compliments the kids.
Once she moved in with us, she started pouring hot water over the threshold to ward off demons, tying red strings around the kids' wrists.
One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof.
Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick a lot.
And you suspect Golda?
She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.
But at the same time, she dotes on him like she's afraid of him.
Afraid of him or for him?
I just don't know.
Are you familiar with Munchausen by proxy?
Are you accusing us of child abuse?
Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.
I could never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr. Holvey, with a professional counselor.
Oh, boy.
This is gonna be hard.
What do they want?
To take Charlie away?
They want him to talk to a social worker.
She's expecting him.
Social worker?
They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.
- You want to take him away.
You blame me for Teddy, and now you want to take him away from me!
I'm not gonna listen.
This is ridiculous!
If you want to come, you can, but I'm taking Charlie now.
No, Steven.
He's my son too.
What is that?
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get your coat.
- You have no right to do this.
- Maggie.
Come on.
We'll meet you out front.
- Okay, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.
Good.
Damn it.
No!
No!
Daddy!
No!
No!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Mulder.
Daddy, no!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You see this?
Find anything?
Yeah, maybe.
Looks like ash.
Yeah, it's everywhere.
Look at this.
The Holvey's said earlier that they had some problems with the wiring of the house.
- It could be from the motor shorting out.
- I checked.
It's working fine.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna have this analyzed.
Before we do anything, I think we should get Charlie out of this house.
I just put a call into a social worker who's going to come and make a report.
The courts are reluctant to intervene in these matters.
Not when a child is in danger.
And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.
Really?
You still think this is Munchausen by proxy, Scully?
Without a doubt.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
Stay away from our house!
- Hey, you want to see something weird?
- What?
Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holvey's house.
- No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.
- What do you mean?
It contains nothing organic or inorganic.
In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.
Oh, wow!
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to the glamours of academia, he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
It's called Vibuti.
Holy Ash.
Technically, it's known as an apport.
Something that materializes out of thin air.
Wait a second.
Nothing just materializes out of thin air.

- RememberJesus creating the loaves and the fishes?
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
In 1979, I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.

You could've run it through your computer and seen the entire Last Supper.
Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings.
Or during bilocation, which is a phenomenon... where a person's energy is transported to a different location.
That energy could have been what set off the garage door opener.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that.
- Or somebody activated the remote control.
- Who are you suggesting?
Who was standing outside when the garage door opened unexpectedly on us yesterday?
The old lady.
And Charlie.
Mrs. Holvey?
My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the F.B.I.
I've been instructed to file a report for the court.
May I come in?
No.
Please.
I've already had enough trouble.
I understand, Mrs. Holvey.
But if you won't talk to me, I'm going to have to put that in the report, and it could very well complicate your situation.
- Mommy!
- Charlie!
Oh, my God!
Charlie.
It's okay, Charlie.
It's okay, Charlie.
It's okay.
He's been sick.
My mother was supposed to be looking after him.
Mother!
Mother!
Get out of my house!
Get out!
I have had enough, Mother.
I want you out of my house.
No!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Agent Scully, the grandmother's taken the child.
She's locked him in the room with her.
She may have a knife.
I've called 9-1-1.
- What happened?
- There were three strange men performing some kind of ritual.
No!
No, Nanna!
It is the only way.
No!
Mother!
Oh, my God.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
That should about do it.
Okay, guys.
Did you talk to Charlie?
He says he doesn't remember anything.
The coroner's preliminary report states that she died of a heart attack.
But those wounds, Mulder, I'd swear it looked like her eyes were pecked out.
There was more ash beneath the old woman's body.
And look at this.

I think it's a ceremonial herb.
You think this was a ritual killing?
No.
The reverse swastika and red string around Charlie's wrist are protective devices.
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.
But I think the old woman knew the family was in trouble.
And those men were here doing a ritual to help her.
I told you before, get out of my house!
I am not interested in your superstition.
Now, get out!

Charlie, you're going to be okay.
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting.
- How's Mrs. Holvey?
- I'm amazed she hasn't broken down completely.
She's in the waiting room trying to get some sleep.

- We've gotta get to Mrs. Holvey's house.
- Why?
That boy you saw leave?
That wasn't Charlie.
Are you saying that Mrs. Holvey left here with a ghost?
Spirit or ghost, I'm not sure.
But it's what we saw in the photograph.
It's what the old woman was trying to protect the family from.
- But...
- Whatever it is, it's killed three people.
You've got to get to Mrs. Holvey's before it happens again.
What are you gonna do?
Get help.
There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?
- No, dear, I'm not hungry.
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes, sure.
Can I have a balloon?
Uh-huh.
Can we ride the train, Mommy?
Now, you finish up and Mommy will be right back, okay?
Please, God, don't let it be true.
What are you doing, Mommy?
Mommy?
Guard the door.
Mrs. Holvey?
Hello?
Come hold him down.
Don't look at it!
Look away or it will recognize you!
Charlie?
Mommy?
It hurts!
Do not let go!
He tricks you!
- Are you all right?
- Charlie?
Let the boy rest.
We must find the mother.
The boy needs her.
- Scully, are you all right?
- We're okay.
How's Charlie?
Charlie?
Hello, sweetie.
- Charlie?
- It is over for now.
But you must be careful.
It knows you.
The strange case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred... during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved.
The boy, who will celebrate his tenth birthday next month, remains under the watchful care of his mother.
And though I believe him innocent of the crimes,
I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari.
That neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection... against the howling heart of evil.
Charlie!
Come on, Charlie!
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Charlie, hey!
Ice cream.
Hey, buddy!
Do you want some ice cream?
Yeah?
Here, Charlie.
Here you go.
Look!
There it goes!
Going to balloon land.
Go bye-bye.
- (baby cries)
- Oh, ssh.
Oh, sweetie, don't cry.
Hey, look.
Here's some ice cream.
Want some ice cream?
Look.
Here.
Teddy...
Teddy, here's your balloon.
- Look at that!
Here you go.
- Oh!
Such a mess.
- We gotta clean you up.
- Charlie and I'll wait for you.
- That was my balloon.
- Eat your ice cream before it melts.
I don't want any ice cream.
I want my balloon.
We'll get you a balloon, OK?
No.
I want my balloon.
Fine.
We'll get you another balloon.
That was a waste of good money.
Ooh!
There we go.
Yes.
OK.
Ohh!
There we go.
That's a boy.
What a good boy.
OK.
OK, Teddy.
I'll be right back, OK?
# There were six in the bed and the little one said
# Roll over, roll over
# So they all rolled over and one fell out
# Five in the bed and the little one said
# Roll over, roll over
# So they all rolled over and one fell out
# Four in the bed and the little one said roll over, roll over
# So they all rolled over and one fell out

# So they all rolled over and one fell out

Teddy!
- There's a kid on the track!
- Oh, my God!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Get away from there!
Teddy!

Damn!
Teddy!
Tell Teddy to get off the track!
No!
Oh, my God!

X-Files Season 2 Episode 21
- The Calusari
This was taken at an amusement park three months ago.
The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two.
- He was killed seconds after this was taken.
- How?
According to the police report, he wandered in front of the miniature train.
The conductor was unable to stop due to malfunctioning brakes.
Teddy's dad works for the State Department.
A coroner's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances of the accident.
- Did the inquest find anything unusual?
- No.
But the county medical examiner was disturbed by this case and by this photo and I think with good reason.
You see, this is a helium balloon.
One thing I learnt in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up.
- But this is moving away horizontally.
- Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?
The National Weather Service say on that day the wind was blowing north.
But the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.
- Pulled?
By whom?
- I don't know.
So I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging.
Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a photographic print.
Not details.
Information.
Watch the monitor.
We have limitations on how much the eye can perceive unaided.
But with this special software, which I designed, we can detect hidden information.
We can manipulate it, enhance it.
Now watch right here.
There it is.
It's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.
So you're saying that, uh...
a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?
Did anyone check the camera that took the photo?
- The lens or the pressure plate?
- It all checked out, Scully.
I think this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.
This is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree.
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.
To get on the tracks, Teddy Holvey escaped this childproof halter that his mom had tied to a sink.
- I've seen some slippery two-year-olds.
So the CME put it on his own two-year-old and found it was impossible for the kid to free himself.
So unless Teddy was the reincarnation of Houdini...
And that would be an X-File in itself.
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.
We're here apart from that investigation.
We believe something may have been overlooked.
Like what?
The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.
- Oh, my God.
- There were over a hundred witnesses.
We saw Teddy ourselves.
He was chasing a balloon.
There was no one else around.
It was an awful accident, but that's all it was-an accident.
Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?
He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?
I don't know what you're getting at.
We loved Teddy.
If you're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids, you're way out of line.
Mrs Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?
I already told the inquest I heard nothing.
Mrs Holvey, at the time of the accident did you have any hired help?
No.
My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening?
Things moved, odd objects appearing?
It's that damn smoke detector.
I'll be right back.
Does this happen often?
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.
(speaks Romanian)
- Mother.
- Diavolo!
Mother, it was just a false alarm.
No!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
Stop it!
What is she saying?
- Maggie!
- You marry a devil.
You have devil child!
I'm sorry.
D'you recognise this?
- It's a swastika.
- It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot.
It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck used by various cultures since the Middle Ages.
The child had one on the back of his hand last night.
My guess?
It was drawn by the old lady-to protect the boy.
- Yes, I saw her drawing it.
- You didn't think that was strange?
I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get but just not from ghosties or beasties.
Look at this.
Have you ever heard of Münchhausen by proxy?
Yeah, my grandfather used to take it for his stomach.
When a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status.
Look at Teddy's medical history.
You'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.
Projectile vomiting at three months diarrhoea at four months, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea...
Each time they were unable to determine the cause.
- And no one questioned this?
- The family moved around with Steve's job.
Records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital.
But this abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.
- He had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.
Often the perpetrator of Münchhausen by proxy will view the child as evil.
The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.
Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully?
Things have been strange since Golda, my mother-in-law, moved in with us.
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.
Golda forbade our marriage, said I was the devil.
After I transferred back to the US, things got somewhat better until Teddy was born and she came to live with us.
That's when the strangeness really started.
What kind of strangeness?
Superstitions rule Golda's life.
She'll spit if anyone compliments the kids.
Once she moved in, she poured hot water over the threshold to ward off demons tied red strings around the kids' wrists.
One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof.
Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick... a lot.
- And you suspect Golda?
- She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.
But at the same time she dotes on him like... she's afraid of him.
Afraid of him or for him?
I just don't know.
Are you familiar with Münchhausen by proxy?
Are you accusing us of child abuse?
Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.
I could never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.
This is gonna be hard.
- Maggie!
- What do they want?
To take Charlie away?
They just want him to talk with a social worker.
- They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.
You want to take him away!
You blame me for Teddy and you want to take him away.
I won't listen to this.
This is ridiculous!
If you wanna come, you can.
I'm taking Charlie now.
No, Steven!
- What was that?
- (speaks Romanian)
Come on, Charlie, let's get your coat.
- You have no right to do this!
- Maggie.
Come on.
We'll meet you out front.
- OK, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.
Dammit!
No!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Noooo!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Mulder.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You see this?
- Find anything?
- Yeah, maybe.
It looks like ash.
Yeah.
It's everywhere.
Look at this.
The Holveys said earlier they had problems with the wiring.
- It could be the motor shorted out.
- No, the motor's fine.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'll have this analysed.
Before we do anything, we should get Charlie out of here.
I called a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.
- The courts will be reluctant to intervene.
- Not when a child is in danger.
And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.
Really?
- Still think this is Münchhausen by proxy?
- Without a doubt.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
Stay away from our house!
- Hey.
You wanna see something weird?
- What?
Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holveys' house.
No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.
- What do you mean?
- It contains nothing organic or inorganic.
In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.
Oh, wow!
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to academia he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
- It's called vibuti.
Holy ash.
Technically it's called an apport - something that materialises out of thin air.
Wait a second.
Nothing materialises out of thin air.
You've read the Bible?
Remember Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
- In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.
Too bad you didn't take a picture and use your computer to see the entire Last Supper.
Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings or during bilocation which is a phenomenon where a person's energy is transported to a different location.
That energy could have been what set off the garage-door opener.
Yeah, that-or somebody activated the remote control.
Well, who are you suggesting did that?
Who was standing outside when the garage door opened on us yesterday?
The old lady... and Charlie.
(chanting in Romanian)
(boy cries out in Romanian)
Mrs Holvey?
My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the FBI.
I've been instructed to file a report for the court.
- May I come in?
- No.
- Please, I've already had enough trouble.
- I understand, Mrs Holvey.
But if you won't talk to me, I'll have to put that in the report and it could very well complicate your situation.
- Mommy!
- Charlie?
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
He's been sick.
My mother was supposed to be looking after him.
Mother?
Mother!
- (Golda speaks Romanian)
- Get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Get out!
I have had enough, Mother.
I want you out of my house.
(Golda speaks Romanian)
No!
Mother!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
The grandmother's taken the child and locked him in the room with her.
- She may have a knife.
I've called 911.
- What happened?
There were three strange men.
They were performing some kind of ritual.
No!
No, Nanna!
(speaks Romanian)
It is the only way.
No!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
Mother!
Mother!
- Did you talk to Charlie?
- He says he doesn't remember anything.
The coroner's preliminary report says she died of a heart attack.
But those wounds...
I'd swear her eyes were pecked out.
There was more ash on the floor beneath the old woman's body.
And look at this.
- What is it?
- It's mugwort.
I think it's a ceremonial herb.
- Was this a ritual killing?
- No, the reverse swastika on the window and the red string around his wrist are protective devices.
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.
But the old woman knew the family was in trouble.
Those men were here to help her.
I told you before, get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
I am not interested in your superstition.
Now get out.
Now!
- Mrs Holvey?
- It's all right.
- Who are they?
- They are the Calusari.
In Romania they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites.
What did he say?
He said it's not over.
- The evil is still here.
- Excuse me.
Sir?
Can I have a word with you?
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
You were trying to protect the family, weren't you?
You said there was still evil here.
Sir!
I can arrest you if I have to.
The evil that is here has always been.
It has gone by different names through history.
Cain, Lucifer, Hitler.
It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men.
If you try to stop us, the blood will be on your hands.
Mrs Holvey?
I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.
My mother used to say that evil follows evil.
Once someone suffers a misfortune, they'll always have bad luck.
I used to think that was just a superstition.
Now I don't know what to believe.
I blamed her, you know?
For all that's happened.
I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me.
Punish you for what?
For abandoning the old ways.
I was raised to believe, as she did, in spirits.
The unseen world.
When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.
Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.
She thought Charlie was responsible somehow.
How could he be responsible for all this horror?
He's just a little boy!
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.
Charlie?
I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you remember how you got there?
No.
Your mother said you were there.
Remember?
I wasn't there!
Many people saw you in the room.
It wasn't me!
I wasn't there!
It wasn't me!
- Who was in the room?
- No!
Was there someone else in the room?
No!
I didn't hurt her!
Charlie?
Charlie!
Who hurt your grandmother?
Charlie!
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie?
Who?
It was Michael!
Michael!
Mrs Holvey?
We never told him.
It was agreed upon.
It was our secret.
What secret, Mrs Holvey?
What are you talking about?
Michael.
He was Charlie's twin.
He was stillborn.
Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it.
My mother she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael's death - ...to divide their souls.
She said... if we didn't, the world of the dead would follow Charlie.
But it was just a superstition.
Help!
I need your help.
- Charlie?
- He's having some kind of seizure.
Don't restrain him.
Let's turn him on his side.
Charlie, you're going to be OK.
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting.
How's Mrs Holvey?
I'm amazed she hasn't broken down.
She's in the waiting room, trying to sleep.
The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure, but they're unable to determine the cause.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm Nurse Castor.
I'm just gonna give you something to help you sleep.
- No, I don't want a shot!
- I know, but if you spit out your medicine we have to give it to you some other way.
- No!
Just relax.
It won't hurt.
Afterwards I'll give you a sticker.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch.
- Now I want you to relax.
- Stop it!
- Charlie...
Now, I want you to behave.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, I want you to behave.
Just relax.
- No!
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
No, Michael!
Michael, don't!
Mommy?
- I want to go home now.
- Charlie?
What are you doing up?
Why are you dressed?
They said I could go home now.
- Who said that?
- The doctors.
They said I could leave.
All right, then.
Let's just get your coat.
- And we'll talk to the doctors.
- No, Mommy.
Let's just go home.
Now!
OK, Charlie.
We'll go straight home.
What are you looking at?
- Is that Mrs Holvey?
- Where?
There.
I think she's got Charlie with her.
Ohh...
Oh.
Nurse!
- Are you all right?
- He hit me.
- Who?
Charlie?
- No, not him.
The other one.
There were two of them.
Two boys.
- You gotta get to Mrs Holvey.
- Why?
The boy who left with Mrs Holvey wasn't Charlie.
- Are you saying she left with a ghost?
- Or a spirit.
I'm not sure.
It's what was in the photo and what the old woman tried to protect the family from.
It's killed three people.
You've got to get to Mrs Holvey's before it happens again.
- What are you gonna do?
- Get help.
- There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?
No, dear.
I'm not hungry.
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes.
Sure.
Can I have a balloon?
Uh-huh.
Can we ride the train, Mommy?
Now, you finish up and Mommy will be right back, OK?
(speaks Romanian)
Please God, don't let it be true.
What are you doing, Mommy?
- (chants in Romanian)
- Mommy?
Guard the door.
Mrs Holvey?
Hello?
(chanting in Romanian)
(cries out in Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Come hold him down.
Don't look at it!
Look away or it will recognise you.
(Maggie chants in Romanian)
Charlie?
Mommy?
(chants in Romanian)
(shouts in Romanian)
It hurts!
Do not let go!
He tricks you.
- Are you all right?
- Charlie?
Let the boy rest.
We must find the mother.
The boy needs her.
- Scully, are you all right?
- We're OK.
How's Charlie?

This was taken at an amusement park three months ago.
The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two.

You'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.
Projectile vomiting at three months diarrhoea at four months, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea...
Each time they were unable to determine the cause.
- And no one questioned this?
- The family moved around with Steve's job.
Records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital.
But this abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.
- He had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.
Often the perpetrator of Münchhausen by proxy will view the child as evil.
The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.
Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully?
Things have been strange since Golda, my mother-in-law, moved in with us.
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.
Golda forbade our marriage, said I was the devil.
After I transferred back to the US, things got somewhat better until Teddy was born and she came to live with us.
That's when the strangeness really started.
What kind of strangeness?
Superstitions rule Golda's life.
She'll spit if anyone compliments the kids.
Once she moved in, she poured hot water over the threshold to ward off demons tied red strings around the kids' wrists.
One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof.
Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick... a lot.
- And you suspect Golda?
- She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.
But at the same time she dotes on him like... she's afraid of him.
Afraid of him or for him?
I just don't know.
Are you familiar with Münchhausen by proxy?
Are you accusing us of child abuse?
Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.
I could never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.
This is gonna be hard.
- Maggie!
- What do they want?
To take Charlie away?
They just want him to talk with a social worker.
- They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.
You want to take him away!
You blame me for Teddy and you want to take him away.
I won't listen to this.
This is ridiculous!
If you wanna come, you can.
I'm taking Charlie now.
No, Steven!
- What was that?
- (speaks Romanian)
Come on, Charlie, let's get your coat.
- You have no right to do this!
- Maggie.
Come on.
We'll meet you out front.
- OK, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.
Dammit!
No!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Noooo!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Mulder.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You see this?
- Find anything?
- Yeah, maybe.
It looks like ash.
Yeah.
It's everywhere.
Look at this.
The Holveys said earlier they had problems with the wiring.
- It could be the motor shorted out.
- No, the motor's fine.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'll have this analysed.
Before we do anything, we should get Charlie out of here.
I called a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.
- The courts will be reluctant to intervene.
- Not when a child is in danger.
And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.
Really?
- Still think this is Münchhausen by proxy?
- Without a doubt.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
Stay away from our house!
- Hey.
You wanna see something weird?
- What?
Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holveys' house.
No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.
- What do you mean?
- It contains nothing organic or inorganic.
In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.
Oh, wow!
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to academia he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
- It's called vibuti.
Holy ash.
Technically it's called an apport - something that materialises out of thin air.
Wait a second.
Nothing materialises out of thin air.
You've read the Bible?
Remember Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
- In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.
Too bad you didn't take a picture and use your computer to see the entire Last Supper.
Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings or during bilocation which is a phenomenon where a person's energy is transported to a different location.
That energy could have been what set off the garage-door opener.
Yeah, that-or somebody activated the remote control.
Well, who are you suggesting did that?
Who was standing outside when the garage door opened on us yesterday?
The old lady... and Charlie.
(chanting in Romanian)
(boy cries out in Romanian)
Mrs Holvey?
My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the FBI.
I've been instructed to file a report for the court.
- May I come in?
- No.
- Please, I've already had enough trouble.
- I understand, Mrs Holvey.
But if you won't talk to me, I'll have to put that in the report and it could very well complicate your situation.
- Mommy!
- Charlie?
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
He's been sick.
My mother was supposed to be looking after him.
Mother?
Mother!
- (Golda speaks Romanian)
- Get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Get out!
I have had enough, Mother.
I want you out of my house.
(Golda speaks Romanian)
No!
Mother!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
The grandmother's taken the child and locked him in the room with her.
- She may have a knife.
I've called 911.
- What happened?
There were three strange men.
They were performing some kind of ritual.
No!
No, Nanna!
(speaks Romanian)
It is the only way.
No!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
Mother!
Mother!
- Did you talk to Charlie?
- He says he doesn't remember anything.
The coroner's preliminary report says she died of a heart attack.
But those wounds...
I'd swear her eyes were pecked out.
There was more ash on the floor beneath the old woman's body.
And look at this.
- What is it?
- It's mugwort.
I think it's a ceremonial herb.
- Was this a ritual killing?
- No, the reverse swastika on the window and the red string around his wrist are protective devices.
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.
But the old woman knew the family was in trouble.
Those men were here to help her.
I told you before, get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
I am not interested in your superstition.
Now get out.
Now!
- Mrs Holvey?
- It's all right.
- Who are they?
- They are the Calusari.
In Romania they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites.
What did he say?
He said it's not over.
- The evil is still here.
- Excuse me.
Sir?
Can I have a word with you?
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
You were trying to protect the family, weren't you?
You said there was still evil here.
Sir!
I can arrest you if I have to.
The evil that is here has always been.
It has gone by different names through history.
Cain, Lucifer, Hitler.
It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men.
If you try to stop us, the blood will be on your hands.
Mrs Holvey?
I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.
My mother used to say that evil follows evil.
Once someone suffers a misfortune, they'll always have bad luck.
I used to think that was just a superstition.
Now I don't know what to believe.
I blamed her, you know?
For all that's happened.
I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me.
Punish you for what?
For abandoning the old ways.
I was raised to believe, as she did, in spirits.
The unseen world.
When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.
Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.
She thought Charlie was responsible somehow.
How could he be responsible for all this horror?
He's just a little boy!
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.
Charlie?
I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you remember how you got there?
No.
Your mother said you were there.
Remember?
I wasn't there!
Many people saw you in the room.
It wasn't me!
I wasn't there!
It wasn't me!
- Who was in the room?
- No!
Was there someone else in the room?
No!
I didn't hurt her!
Charlie?
Charlie!
Who hurt your grandmother?
Charlie!
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie?
Who?
It was Michael!
Michael!
Mrs Holvey?
We never told him.
It was agreed upon.
It was our secret.
What secret, Mrs Holvey?
What are you talking about?
Michael.
He was Charlie's twin.
He was stillborn.
Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it.
My mother she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael's death - ...to divide their souls.
She said... if we didn't, the world of the dead would follow Charlie.
But it was just a superstition.
Help!
I need your help.
- Charlie?
- He's having some kind of seizure.
Don't restrain him.
Let's turn him on his side.
Charlie, you're going to be OK.
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting.
How's Mrs Holvey?
I'm amazed she hasn't broken down.
She's in the waiting room, trying to sleep.
The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure, but they're unable to determine the cause.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm Nurse Castor.
I'm just gonna give you something to help you sleep.
- No, I don't want a shot!
- I know, but if you spit out your medicine we have to give it to you some other way.
- No!
Just relax.
It won't hurt.
Afterwards I'll give you a sticker.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch.
- Now I want you to relax.
- Stop it!
- Charlie...
Now, I want you to behave.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, I want you to behave.
Just relax.
- No!
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
No, Michael!
Michael, don't!
Mommy?
- I want to go home now.
- Charlie?
What are you doing up?
Why are you dressed?
They said I could go home now.
- Who said that?
- The doctors.
They said I could leave.
All right, then.
Let's just get your coat.
- And we'll talk to the doctors.
- No, Mommy.
Let's just go home.
Now!
OK, Charlie.
We'll go straight home.
What are you looking at?
- Is that Mrs Holvey?
- Where?
There.
I think she's got Charlie with her.
Ohh...
Oh.
Nurse!
- Are you all right?
- He hit me.
- Who?
Charlie?
- No, not him.
The other one.
There were two of them.
Two boys.
- You gotta get to Mrs Holvey.
- Why?
The boy who left with Mrs Holvey wasn't Charlie.
- Are you saying she left with a ghost?
- Or a spirit.
I'm not sure.
It's what was in the photo and what the old woman tried to protect the family from.
It's killed three people.
You've got to get to Mrs Holvey's before it happens again.
- What are you gonna do?
- Get help.
- There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?
No, dear.
I'm not hungry.
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes.
Sure.
Can I have a balloon?
Uh-huh.
Can we ride the train, Mommy?
Now, you finish up and Mommy will be right back, OK?
(speaks Romanian)
Please God, don't let it be true.
What are you doing, Mommy?
- (chants in Romanian)
- Mommy?
Guard the door.
Mrs Holvey?
Hello?
(chanting in Romanian)
(cries out in Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Come hold him down.
Don't look at it!
Look away or it will recognise you.
(Maggie chants in Romanian)
Charlie?
Mommy?
(chants in Romanian)
(shouts in Romanian)
It hurts!
Do not let go!
He tricks you.
- Are you all right?
- Charlie?
Let the boy rest.
We must find the mother.
The boy needs her.
- Scully, are you all right?
- We're OK.
How's Charlie?
Charlie!
Hello, sweetie.
Charlie!
It is over... for now.
But you must be careful.
It knows you.
The case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved.
The boy, who celebrates his tenth birthday next month, is under the care of his mother.
Though I believe him to be innocent, I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari:
...that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil.

Charlie!
Come on, Charlie!
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Charlie, hey!
Ice cream.
Hey, buddy!
Do you want some ice cream?
Yeah?
Here, Charlie.
Here you go.
Look!
There it goes!
Going to balloon land.
Go bye-bye.
Oh, ssh.
Oh, sweetie, don't cry.
Hey, look.
Here's some ice cream.
Want some ice cream?
Look.
Here.
Teddy...
Teddy, here's your balloon.
- Look at that!
Here you go.
- Oh!
Such a mess.
- We gotta clean you up.
- Charlie and I'll wait for you.
- That was my balloon.
- Eat your ice cream before it melts.
I don't want any ice cream.
I want my balloon.
We'll get you a balloon, OK?
No.
I want my balloon.
Fine.
We'll get you another balloon.
That was a waste of good money.
Ooh!
There we go.
Yes.
OK.
Ohh!
There we go.
That's a boy.
What a good boy.
OK.
OK, Teddy.
I'll be right back, OK?
There were six in the bed and the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out
Five in the bed and the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out
Four in the bed and the little one said roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out
Three in the bed and the little one said roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out
Two in the bed and the little one said...
Teddy?
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
- There's a kid on the track!
- Oh, my God!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Get away from there!
Teddy!
Teddy, come here!
Damn!
Teddy!
Tell Teddy to get off the track!
No!
Oh, my God!
Teddy?
Maggie...
Teddy...
This was taken at an amusement park three months ago.
The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two.
- He was killed seconds after this was taken.
- How?
According to the police report, he wandered in front of the miniature train.
The conductor was unable to stop due to malfunctioning brakes.
Teddy's dad works for the State Department.
A coroner's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances of the accident.
- Did the inquest find anything unusual?
- No.
But the county medical examiner was disturbed by this case and by this photo,... ..and I think with good reason.
You see, this is a helium balloon.
One thing I learnt in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up.
- But this is moving away horizontally.
- Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?
The National Weather Service say on that day the wind was blowing north.
But the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.
- Pulled?
By whom?
- I don't know.
So I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging.
Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a photographic print.
Not details.
Information.
Watch the monitor.
We have limitations on how much the eye can perceive unaided.
But with this special software, which I designed, we can detect hidden information.
We can manipulate it, enhance it.
Now watch right here.
There it is.
It's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.
So you're saying that, uh...
a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?
Did anyone check the camera that took the photo?
- The lens or the pressure plate?
- It all checked out, Scully.
I think this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.
This is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo... ..with Jesus' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree.
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.
To get on the tracks, Teddy Holvey escaped this childproof halter...
- ..that his mom had tied to a sink.
- I've seen some slippery two-year-olds.
So the CME put it on his own two-year-old... ..and found it was impossible for the kid to free himself.
So unless Teddy was the reincarnation of Houdini...
And that would be an X-File in itself.
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.
We're here apart from that investigation.
We believe something may have been overlooked.
Like what?
The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.
- Oh, my God.
- There were over a hundred witnesses.
We saw Teddy ourselves.
He was chasing a balloon.
There was no one else around.
It was an awful accident, but that's all it was - an accident.
Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?
He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?
I don't know what you're getting at.
We loved Teddy.
If you're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids, you're way out of line.
Mrs Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?
I already told the inquest I heard nothing.
Mrs Holvey, at the time of the accident did you have any hired help?
No.
My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening?
Things moved, odd objects appearing?
It's that damn smoke detector.
I'll be right back.
Does this happen often?
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.
- Mother.
- Diavolo!
Mother, it was just a false alarm.
No!
Mother!
Stop it!
What is she saying?
- Maggie!
- You marry a devil.
You have devil child!
I'm sorry.
D'you recognise this?
- It's a swastika.
- It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot.
It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck,... ..used by various cultures since the Middle Ages.
The child had one on the back of his hand last night.
My guess?
It was drawn by the old lady - to protect the boy.
- Yes, I saw her drawing it.
- You didn't think that was strange?
I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get,... ..but just not from ghosties or beasties.
Look at this.
Have you ever heard of Münchhausen by proxy?
Yeah, my grandfather used to take it for his stomach.
When a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child... ..by inducing symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status.
Look at Teddy's medical history.
You'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times... ..during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.

The unseen world.
When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.
Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.
She thought Charlie was responsible somehow.
He's just a little boy!
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.
Charlie?
I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you remember how you got there?
No.
Your mother said you were there.
Remember?
I wasn't there!
Many people saw you in the room.
It wasn't me!
I wasn't there!
It wasn't me!
- Who was in the room?
- No!
Was there someone else in the room?
No!
I didn't hurt her!
Charlie?
Charlie!
Who hurt your grandmother?
Charlie!
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie?
Who?
It was Michael!
Michael!
Mrs Holvey?
We never told him.
It was agreed upon.
It was our secret.
What secret, Mrs Holvey?
What are you talking about?
Michael.
He was Charlie's twin.
He was stillborn.
Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it.
My mother,... ..she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael's death -
..to divide their souls.
She said... if we didn't, the world of the dead would follow Charlie.
But it was just a superstition.
Help!
I need your help.
- Charlie?
- He's having some kind of seizure.
Don't restrain him.
Let's turn him on his side.
Charlie, you're going to be OK.
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting.
How's Mrs Holvey?
I'm amazed she hasn't broken down.
She's in the waiting room, trying to sleep.
The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure, but they're unable to determine the cause.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm Nurse Castor.
I'm just gonna give you something to help you sleep.
- No, I don't want a shot!
- I know, but if you spit out your medicine,...
- ..we have to give it to you some other way.
- No!
Just relax.
It won't hurt.
Afterwards I'll give you a sticker.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch.
- Now I want you to relax.
- Stop it!
- Charlie...
Now, I want you to behave.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, I want you to behave.
Just relax.
- No!
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
No, Michael!
Michael, don't!
Mommy?
- I want to go home now.
- Charlie?
What are you doing up?
Why are you dressed?
They said I could go home now.
- Who said that?
- The doctors.
They said I could leave.
All right, then.
Let's just get your coat.
- And we'll talk to the doctors.
- No, Mommy.
Let's just go home.
Now!
OK, Charlie.
We'll go straight home.
What are you looking at?
- Is that Mrs Holvey?
- Where?
There.
I think she's got Charlie with her.
Ohh...
Oh.
Nurse!
- Are you all right?
- He hit me.
- Who?
Charlie?
- No, not him.
The other one.
There were two of them.
Two boys.
- You gotta get to Mrs Holvey.
- Why?
The boy who left with Mrs Holvey wasn't Charlie.
- Are you saying she left with a ghost?
- Or a spirit.
I'm not sure.
It's what was in the photo and what the old woman tried to protect the family from.
It's killed three people.
You've got to get to Mrs Holvey's before it happens again.
- What are you gonna do?
- Get help.
- There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?
No, dear.
I'm not hungry.
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes.
Sure.
Can I have a balloon?
Uh-huh.
Can we ride the train, Mommy?
Now, you finish up and Mommy will be right back, OK?
Please God, don't let it be true.
What are you doing, Mommy?
Mommy?
Guard the door.
Mrs Holvey?
Hello?
Come hold him down.
Don't look at it!
Look away or it will recognise you.
Charlie?
Mommy?
It hurts!
Do not let go!
He tricks you.
- Are you all right?
- Charlie?
Let the boy rest.
We must find the mother.
The boy needs her.
- Scully, are you all right?
- We're OK.
How's Charlie?
Charlie!
Hello, sweetie.
Charlie!
It is over... for now.
But you must be careful.
It knows you.
The case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred... ..during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved.
The boy, who celebrates his tenth birthday next month, is under the care of his mother.
Though I believe him to be innocent, I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari:
..that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil.
I made this!
Charlie!
Come on, Charlie!
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Charlie, hey!
Ice cream.
Hey, buddy!
Do you want some ice cream?
Yeah?
Here, Charlie.
Here you go.
Look!
There it goes!
Going to balloon land.
Go bye-bye.
- (baby cries)
- Oh, ssh.
Oh, sweetie, don't cry.
Hey, look.
Here's some ice cream.
Want some ice cream?
Look.
Here.
Teddy...
Teddy, here's your balloon.
- Look at that!
Here you go.
- Oh!
Such a mess.
- We gotta clean you up.
- Charlie and I'll wait for you.
- That was my balloon.
- Eat your ice cream before it melts.
I don't want any ice cream.
I want my balloon.
We'll get you a balloon, OK?
No.
I want my balloon.
Fine.
We'll get you another balloon.
That was a waste of good money.
Ooh!
There we go.
Yes.
OK.
Ohh!
There we go.
That's a boy.
What a good boy.
OK.
OK, Teddy.
I'll be right back, OK?
# There were six in the bed and the little one said
# Roll over, roll over
# So they all rolled over and one fell out
# Five in the bed and the little one said
# Roll over, roll over
# So they all rolled over and one fell out
# Four in the bed and the little one said roll over, roll over
# So they all rolled over and one fell out
# Three in the bed and the little one said roll over, roll over
# So they all rolled over and one fell out
# Two in the bed and the little one said...
Teddy?
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Teddy!
- There's a kid on the track!
- Oh, my God!
Teddy!
Teddy!
Get away from there!
Teddy!
Teddy, come here!
Damn!
Teddy!
Tell Teddy to get off the track!
No!
Oh, my God!
Teddy?

X-Files Season 2 Episode 21
- The Calusari
This was taken at an amusement park three months ago.
The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two.
- He was killed seconds after this was taken.
- How?
According to the police report, he wandered in front of the miniature train.
The conductor was unable to stop due to malfunctioning brakes.
Teddy's dad works for the State Department.
A coroner's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances of the accident.
- Did the inquest find anything unusual?
- No.
But the county medical examiner was disturbed by this case and by this photo and I think with good reason.
You see, this is a helium balloon.
One thing I learnt in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up.
- But this is moving away horizontally.
- Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?
The National Weather Service say on that day the wind was blowing north.
But the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.
- Pulled?
By whom?
- I don't know.
So I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging.
Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a photographic print.
Not details.
Information.
Watch the monitor.
We have limitations on how much the eye can perceive unaided.
But with this special software, which I designed, we can detect hidden information.
We can manipulate it, enhance it.
Now watch right here.
There it is.
It's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.
So you're saying that, uh...
a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?
Did anyone check the camera that took the photo?
- The lens or the pressure plate?
- It all checked out, Scully.
I think this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.
This is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree.
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.
To get on the tracks, Teddy Holvey escaped this childproof halter that his mom had tied to a sink.
- I've seen some slippery two-year-olds.
So the CME put it on his own two-year-old and found it was impossible for the kid to free himself.
So unless Teddy was the reincarnation of Houdini...
And that would be an X-File in itself.
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.
We're here apart from that investigation.
We believe something may have been overlooked.
Like what?
The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.
- Oh, my God.
- There were over a hundred witnesses.
We saw Teddy ourselves.
He was chasing a balloon.
There was no one else around.
It was an awful accident, but that's all it was-an accident.
Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?
He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?
I don't know what you're getting at.
We loved Teddy.
If you're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids, you're way out of line.
Mrs Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?
I already told the inquest I heard nothing.
Mrs Holvey, at the time of the accident did you have any hired help?
No.
My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening?
Things moved, odd objects appearing?
It's that damn smoke detector.
I'll be right back.
Does this happen often?
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.
(speaks Romanian)
- Mother.
- Diavolo!
Mother, it was just a false alarm.
No!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
Stop it!
What is she saying?
- Maggie!
- You marry a devil.
You have devil child!
I'm sorry.
D'you recognise this?
- It's a swastika.
- It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot.
It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck used by various cultures since the Middle Ages.
The child had one on the back of his hand last night.
My guess?
It was drawn by the old lady-to protect the boy.
- Yes, I saw her drawing it.
- You didn't think that was strange?
I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get but just not from ghosties or beasties.
Look at this.
Have you ever heard of Münchhausen by proxy?
Yeah, my grandfather used to take it for his stomach.
When a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status.
Look at Teddy's medical history.
You'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.
Projectile vomiting at three months diarrhoea at four months, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea...
Each time they were unable to determine the cause.
- And no one questioned this?
- The family moved around with Steve's job.
Records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital.
But this abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.
- He had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.
Often the perpetrator of Münchhausen by proxy will view the child as evil.
The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.
Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully?
Things have been strange since Golda, my mother-in-law, moved in with us.
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.
Golda forbade our marriage, said I was the devil.
After I transferred back to the US, things got somewhat better until Teddy was born and she came to live with us.
That's when the strangeness really started.
What kind of strangeness?
Superstitions rule Golda's life.
She'll spit if anyone compliments the kids.
Once she moved in, she poured hot water over the threshold to ward off demons tied red strings around the kids' wrists.
One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof.
Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick... a lot.
- And you suspect Golda?
- She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.
But at the same time she dotes on him like... she's afraid of him.
Afraid of him or for him?
I just don't know.
Are you familiar with Münchhausen by proxy?
Are you accusing us of child abuse?
Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.
I could never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.
This is gonna be hard.
- Maggie!
- What do they want?
To take Charlie away?
They just want him to talk with a social worker.
- They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.
You want to take him away!
You blame me for Teddy and you want to take him away.
I won't listen to this.
This is ridiculous!
If you wanna come, you can.
I'm taking Charlie now.
No, Steven!
- What was that?
- (speaks Romanian)
Come on, Charlie, let's get your coat.
- You have no right to do this!
- Maggie.
Come on.
We'll meet you out front.
- OK, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.
Dammit!
No!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Noooo!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Mulder.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You see this?
- Find anything?
- Yeah, maybe.
It looks like ash.
Yeah.
It's everywhere.
Look at this.
The Holveys said earlier they had problems with the wiring.
- It could be the motor shorted out.
- No, the motor's fine.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'll have this analysed.
Before we do anything, we should get Charlie out of here.
I called a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.
- The courts will be reluctant to intervene.
- Not when a child is in danger.
And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.
Really?
- Still think this is Münchhausen by proxy?
- Without a doubt.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
Stay away from our house!
- Hey.
You wanna see something weird?
- What?
Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holveys' house.
No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.
- What do you mean?
- It contains nothing organic or inorganic.
In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.
Oh, wow!
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to academia he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
- It's called vibuti.
Holy ash.
Technically it's called an apport - something that materialises out of thin air.
Wait a second.
Nothing materialises out of thin air.
You've read the Bible?
Remember Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
- In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.
Too bad you didn't take a picture and use your computer to see the entire Last Supper.
Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings or during bilocation which is a phenomenon where a person's energy is transported to a different location.
That energy could have been what set off the garage-door opener.
Yeah, that-or somebody activated the remote control.
Well, who are you suggesting did that?
Who was standing outside when the garage door opened on us yesterday?
The old lady... and Charlie.
(chanting in Romanian)
(boy cries out in Romanian)
Mrs Holvey?
My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the FBI.
I've been instructed to file a report for the court.
- May I come in?
- No.
- Please, I've already had enough trouble.
- I understand, Mrs Holvey.
But if you won't talk to me, I'll have to put that in the report and it could very well complicate your situation.
- Mommy!
- Charlie?
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
He's been sick.
My mother was supposed to be looking after him.
Mother?
Mother!
- (Golda speaks Romanian)
- Get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Get out!
I have had enough, Mother.
I want you out of my house.
(Golda speaks Romanian)
No!
Mother!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
The grandmother's taken the child and locked him in the room with her.
- She may have a knife.
I've called 911.
- What happened?
There were three strange men.
They were performing some kind of ritual.
No!
No, Nanna!
(speaks Romanian)
It is the only way.
No!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
Mother!
Mother!
- Did you talk to Charlie?
- He says he doesn't remember anything.
The coroner's preliminary report says she died of a heart attack.
But those wounds...
I'd swear her eyes were pecked out.
There was more ash on the floor beneath the old woman's body.
And look at this.
- What is it?
- It's mugwort.
I think it's a ceremonial herb.
- Was this a ritual killing?
- No, the reverse swastika on the window and the red string around his wrist are protective devices.
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.
But the old woman knew the family was in trouble.
Those men were here to help her.
I told you before, get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
I am not interested in your superstition.
Now get out.
Now!
- Mrs Holvey?
- It's all right.
- Who are they?
- They are the Calusari.
In Romania they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites.
What did he say?
He said it's not over.
- The evil is still here.
- Excuse me.
Sir?
Can I have a word with you?
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
You were trying to protect the family, weren't you?
You said there was still evil here.
Sir!
I can arrest you if I have to.
The evil that is here has always been.
It has gone by different names through history.
Cain, Lucifer, Hitler.
It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men.
If you try to stop us, the blood will be on your hands.
Mrs Holvey?
I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.
My mother used to say that evil follows evil.
Once someone suffers a misfortune, they'll always have bad luck.
I used to think that was just a superstition.
Now I don't know what to believe.
I blamed her, you know?
For all that's happened.
I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me.
Punish you for what?
For abandoning the old ways.
I was raised to believe, as she did, in spirits.
The unseen world.
When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.
Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.
She thought Charlie was responsible somehow.
How could he be responsible for all this horror?
He's just a little boy!
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.
Charlie?
I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday.
Can you tell me about it?

No!
I didn't hurt her!
Charlie?
Charlie!
Who hurt your grandmother?
Charlie!
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie?
Who?
It was Michael!
Michael!
Mrs Holvey?

- The Calusari
This was taken at an amusement park three months ago.
The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two.

- I don't know.
So I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging.
Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a photographic print.
Not details.
Information.
Watch the monitor.
We have limitations on how much the eye can perceive unaided.
But with this special software, which I designed, we can detect hidden information.
We can manipulate it, enhance it.
Now watch right here.
There it is.
It's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.
So you're saying that, uh...
a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?
Did anyone check the camera that took the photo?
- The lens or the pressure plate?
- It all checked out, Scully.
I think this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.
This is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree.
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.
To get on the tracks, Teddy Holvey escaped this childproof halter that his mom had tied to a sink.
- I've seen some slippery two-year-olds.
So the CME put it on his own two-year-old and found it was impossible for the kid to free himself.
So unless Teddy was the reincarnation of Houdini...
And that would be an X-File in itself.
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.
We're here apart from that investigation.
We believe something may have been overlooked.
Like what?
The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.
- Oh, my God.
- There were over a hundred witnesses.
We saw Teddy ourselves.
He was chasing a balloon.
There was no one else around.
It was an awful accident, but that's all it was-an accident.
Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?
He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?
I don't know what you're getting at.
We loved Teddy.
If you're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids, you're way out of line.
Mrs Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?
I already told the inquest I heard nothing.
Mrs Holvey, at the time of the accident did you have any hired help?
No.
My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening?
Things moved, odd objects appearing?
It's that damn smoke detector.
I'll be right back.
Does this happen often?
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.
(speaks Romanian)
- Mother.
- Diavolo!
Mother, it was just a false alarm.
No!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
Stop it!
What is she saying?
- Maggie!
- You marry a devil.
You have devil child!
I'm sorry.
D'you recognise this?
- It's a swastika.
- It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot.
It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck used by various cultures since the Middle Ages.
The child had one on the back of his hand last night.
My guess?
It was drawn by the old lady-to protect the boy.
- Yes, I saw her drawing it.
- You didn't think that was strange?
I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get but just not from ghosties or beasties.
Look at this.
Have you ever heard of Münchhausen by proxy?
Yeah, my grandfather used to take it for his stomach.
When a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status.
Look at Teddy's medical history.
You'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.
Projectile vomiting at three months diarrhoea at four months, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea...
Each time they were unable to determine the cause.
- And no one questioned this?
- The family moved around with Steve's job.
Records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital.
But this abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.
- He had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.
Often the perpetrator of Münchhausen by proxy will view the child as evil.
The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.
Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully?
Things have been strange since Golda, my mother-in-law, moved in with us.
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.
Golda forbade our marriage, said I was the devil.
After I transferred back to the US, things got somewhat better until Teddy was born and she came to live with us.
That's when the strangeness really started.
What kind of strangeness?
Superstitions rule Golda's life.
She'll spit if anyone compliments the kids.
Once she moved in, she poured hot water over the threshold to ward off demons tied red strings around the kids' wrists.
One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof.
Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick... a lot.
- And you suspect Golda?
- She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.
But at the same time she dotes on him like... she's afraid of him.
Afraid of him or for him?
I just don't know.
Are you familiar with Münchhausen by proxy?
Are you accusing us of child abuse?
Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.
I could never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.
This is gonna be hard.
- Maggie!
- What do they want?
To take Charlie away?
They just want him to talk with a social worker.
- They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.
You want to take him away!
You blame me for Teddy and you want to take him away.
I won't listen to this.
This is ridiculous!
If you wanna come, you can.
I'm taking Charlie now.
No, Steven!
- What was that?
- (speaks Romanian)
Come on, Charlie, let's get your coat.
- You have no right to do this!
- Maggie.
Come on.
We'll meet you out front.
- OK, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.
Dammit!
No!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Noooo!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Mulder.
Daddy!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
You see this?
- Find anything?
- Yeah, maybe.
It looks like ash.
Yeah.
It's everywhere.
Look at this.
The Holveys said earlier they had problems with the wiring.
- It could be the motor shorted out.
- No, the motor's fine.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'll have this analysed.
Before we do anything, we should get Charlie out of here.
I called a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.
- The courts will be reluctant to intervene.
- Not when a child is in danger.
And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.
Really?
- Still think this is Münchhausen by proxy?
- Without a doubt.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
Stay away from our house!
- Hey.
You wanna see something weird?
- What?
Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holveys' house.
No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.
- What do you mean?
- It contains nothing organic or inorganic.
In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.
Oh, wow!
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to academia he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
- It's called vibuti.
Holy ash.
Technically it's called an apport - something that materialises out of thin air.
Wait a second.
Nothing materialises out of thin air.
You've read the Bible?
Remember Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
- In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.
Too bad you didn't take a picture and use your computer to see the entire Last Supper.
Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings or during bilocation which is a phenomenon where a person's energy is transported to a different location.
That energy could have been what set off the garage-door opener.
Yeah, that-or somebody activated the remote control.
Well, who are you suggesting did that?
Who was standing outside when the garage door opened on us yesterday?
The old lady... and Charlie.
(chanting in Romanian)
(boy cries out in Romanian)
Mrs Holvey?
My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the FBI.
I've been instructed to file a report for the court.
- May I come in?
- No.
- Please, I've already had enough trouble.
- I understand, Mrs Holvey.
But if you won't talk to me, I'll have to put that in the report and it could very well complicate your situation.
- Mommy!
- Charlie?
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
It's OK, Charlie.
It's OK.
He's been sick.
My mother was supposed to be looking after him.
Mother?
Mother!
- (Golda speaks Romanian)
- Get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Get out!
I have had enough, Mother.
I want you out of my house.
(Golda speaks Romanian)
No!
Mother!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Mother!
The grandmother's taken the child and locked him in the room with her.
- She may have a knife.
I've called 911.
- What happened?
There were three strange men.
They were performing some kind of ritual.
No!
No, Nanna!
(speaks Romanian)
It is the only way.
No!
Mother!
(speaks Romanian)
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
Mother!
Mother!
- Did you talk to Charlie?
- He says he doesn't remember anything.
The coroner's preliminary report says she died of a heart attack.
But those wounds...
I'd swear her eyes were pecked out.
There was more ash on the floor beneath the old woman's body.
And look at this.
- What is it?
- It's mugwort.
I think it's a ceremonial herb.
- Was this a ritual killing?
- No, the reverse swastika on the window and the red string around his wrist are protective devices.
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.
But the old woman knew the family was in trouble.
Those men were here to help her.
I told you before, get out of my house!
(speaks Romanian)
I am not interested in your superstition.
Now get out.
Now!
- Mrs Holvey?
- It's all right.
- Who are they?
- They are the Calusari.
In Romania they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites.
What did he say?
He said it's not over.
- The evil is still here.
- Excuse me.
Sir?
Can I have a word with you?
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
You were trying to protect the family, weren't you?
You said there was still evil here.
Sir!
I can arrest you if I have to.
The evil that is here has always been.
It has gone by different names through history.
Cain, Lucifer, Hitler.
It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men.
If you try to stop us, the blood will be on your hands.
Mrs Holvey?
I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.
My mother used to say that evil follows evil.
Once someone suffers a misfortune, they'll always have bad luck.
I used to think that was just a superstition.
Now I don't know what to believe.
I blamed her, you know?
For all that's happened.
I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me.
Punish you for what?
For abandoning the old ways.
I was raised to believe, as she did, in spirits.
The unseen world.
When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.
Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.
She thought Charlie was responsible somehow.
How could he be responsible for all this horror?
He's just a little boy!
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.
Charlie?
I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday.
Can you tell me about it?
Do you remember how you got there?
No.
Your mother said you were there.
Remember?
I wasn't there!
Many people saw you in the room.
It wasn't me!
I wasn't there!
It wasn't me!
- Who was in the room?
- No!
Was there someone else in the room?
No!
I didn't hurt her!
Charlie?
Charlie!
Who hurt your grandmother?
Charlie!
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie?
Who?
It was Michael!
Michael!
Mrs Holvey?
We never told him.
It was agreed upon.
It was our secret.
What secret, Mrs Holvey?
What are you talking about?
Michael.
He was Charlie's twin.
He was stillborn.
Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it.
My mother she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael's death - ...to divide their souls.
She said... if we didn't, the world of the dead would follow Charlie.
But it was just a superstition.
Help!
I need your help.
- Charlie?
- He's having some kind of seizure.
Don't restrain him.
Let's turn him on his side.
Charlie, you're going to be OK.
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting.
How's Mrs Holvey?
I'm amazed she hasn't broken down.
She's in the waiting room, trying to sleep.
The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure, but they're unable to determine the cause.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm Nurse Castor.
I'm just gonna give you something to help you sleep.
- No, I don't want a shot!
- I know, but if you spit out your medicine we have to give it to you some other way.
- No!
Just relax.
It won't hurt.
Afterwards I'll give you a sticker.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch.
- Now I want you to relax.
- Stop it!
- Charlie...
Now, I want you to behave.
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, I want you to behave.
Just relax.
- No!
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
No, Michael!
Michael, don't!
Mommy?
- I want to go home now.
- Charlie?
What are you doing up?
Why are you dressed?
They said I could go home now.
- Who said that?
- The doctors.
They said I could leave.
All right, then.
Let's just get your coat.
- And we'll talk to the doctors.
- No, Mommy.
Let's just go home.
Now!
OK, Charlie.
We'll go straight home.
What are you looking at?
- Is that Mrs Holvey?
- Where?
There.
I think she's got Charlie with her.
Ohh...
Oh.
Nurse!
- Are you all right?
- He hit me.
- Who?
Charlie?
- No, not him.
The other one.
There were two of them.
Two boys.
- You gotta get to Mrs Holvey.
- Why?
The boy who left with Mrs Holvey wasn't Charlie.
- Are you saying she left with a ghost?
- Or a spirit.
I'm not sure.
It's what was in the photo and what the old woman tried to protect the family from.
It's killed three people.
You've got to get to Mrs Holvey's before it happens again.
- What are you gonna do?
- Get help.
- There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?
No, dear.
I'm not hungry.
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes.
Sure.
Can I have a balloon?
Uh-huh.
Can we ride the train, Mommy?
Now, you finish up and Mommy will be right back, OK?
(speaks Romanian)
Please God, don't let it be true.
What are you doing, Mommy?
- (chants in Romanian)
- Mommy?
Guard the door.
Mrs Holvey?
Hello?
(chanting in Romanian)
(cries out in Romanian)
(speaks Romanian)
Come hold him down.
Don't look at it!
Look away or it will recognise you.
(Maggie chants in Romanian)
Charlie?
Mommy?
(chants in Romanian)
(shouts in Romanian)
It hurts!
Do not let go!
He tricks you.
- Are you all right?
- Charlie?
Let the boy rest.
We must find the mother.
The boy needs her.
- Scully, are you all right?
- We're OK.
How's Charlie?
Charlie!
Hello, sweetie.
Charlie!
It is over... for now.
But you must be careful.
It knows you.
The case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved.
The boy, who celebrates his tenth birthday next month, is under the care of his mother.
Though I believe him to be innocent, I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari:
...that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil.

He's dead.
- Go up to 400.
We lost him.
Let him go.
I'm a doctor!
Go up to 400, or I'll do it myself!

Hello, Mr Goldbaum.
How are we doing tonight?
I'm just going to adjust your drip.
I'll check on you again later.
Any word from Willis?
Still missing.
He hasn't been home or to the office.
I heard something about a mutilation...
Yeah.
Three fingers on Dupre's left hand were severed by surgical shears.
We lifted prints.
They're Willis's.
He said he was chasing this guy for almost a year?
He lived the case.
It was all he ever thought about.
What are you thinking?
That maybe this is some kind of post-trauma psychosis.
Like the way soldiers sometimes mutilate the body of a dead enemy.
That still doesn't explain why he would just vanish.
Dupre's partner...
Who was she?
Lula Phillips.
They met while she was serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter in Maryland.
- He was a prison guard.
- Until the warden found out their secret.
According to Lula's cell mate, they carried on quite a torrid romance.
It says here she was released on May 2nd, 1993.
One week before the first robbery at Annapolis Savings and Loan.
A 65-year-old female teller was pistol-whipped.
Died from a massive subdural haemorrhage.
She didn't put the money in the bag fast enough!
- Lovely couple!
- Well, apparently they took turns.
One pulling ajob, while the other one drove getaway.
Between the two of them they've killed seven people and got away with close to $100,000.
That's a lot of money, now that she doesn't have to split it.
Well, we're putting her face out there.
Local newspapers, America's Most Wanted...
Am I boring you?
- They were married.
- Yeah, last May in Atlantic City.
So what?
So I don't think this was a simple necrophiliac mutilation.
Willis sliced and diced those fingers to get at the wedding ring.
Anybody here?
Lula?
Baby, baby, baby...
Damn!
It's a left thumb print.
Look at these two bifurcations here.
Whoever was holding that cleaver used his left hand.
- "Whoever"?
It was Willis.
- Willis is right-handed.
I checked his pistol grip at the armoury.
But the bank surveillance tapes show Dupre is left-handed.
I'm not sure where you're going with this.
How long did Willis flatline before you revived him?
Just over 13 minutes.
This EKG strip recorded his cardiac activity at the time.
In your medical opinion, what does that look like?
It could be anything.
Instrument malfunction, electrical overload...
But what does it look like?
Two heartbeats.
Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest at the exact same time, right?
Right...
For a period of minutes, both men were technically dead.
- Technically.
But we resuscitated Willis.
- You resuscitated his body.
Mulder...
Two men died in that crash room, Scully.
One man came back.
The question is, which one?
What can you tell me about near-death experiences, Agent Scully?
The usual stuff.
The tunnel, the light, people rising up and viewing their own bodies.
As a scientist, how do you account for the phenomenon?
Some sort of dissociative hallucinatory activity.
Half of all the adults who have had a near-death experience cannot wear a watch.
The increased electrical activity in their bodies renders the watches inoperable.
I know this sounds kooky, but, as any biologist will tell you, when cells die and genetic material begins to unfold, a tremendous charge of energy is released.
Doctor Varnes believes this is responsible for the transformational nature of the experience.
People do return from the event profoundly changed.
Changed how?
Personality shifts, perceived psychic abilities, increased zest for life.
What about the negative consequences?
They're rare.
But in the process of dying there is a time during which the body is vulnerable.
- l don't understand.
- Well, there was a pilot in my support group who died in a commuter plane crash, along with his three passengers.
This was a few years ago.
Now, he recalls floating up in a brilliant aura of light, and then feeling an overwhelming need to return to his body.
He was revived in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.
The only survivor.
Soon after that, the visions started.
Visions of making love to his wife, in ways that weren't in his memory.
Turns out that one of the dead passengers on the plane was having an affair with his wife.
The dead passenger's memory, his... his consciousness, had survived through the pilot.
- What happened?
- The pilot became increasingly disoriented.
Schizophrenic, his doctor claims.
He strangled his wife with an extension cord.
That's a nice story!
I don't discount the near-death experience.
It can be explained empirically,
- by stimulation of the temporal lobe.
- l sense a big "but" coming!
I still believe that Jack's disappearance can be explained in psychological terms.
For instance?
The stress of the case, the trauma of being shot, Jack's personality...
- How well do you know him?
- We dated.
For almost a year.
He was my instructor at the Academy.
The plot thickens!
We even had the same birthday.
We used to celebrate in some dive in Stafford that had a slanted pool table.
But it was always so hard for Jack to relax. lt was impossible for him, really.
He was always so... intense, so relentlessly determined.
Do you believe he's predisposed to this type of psychotic episode?
It's a long way from saying Jack had a near-death experience to saying his body's been inhabited by Warren Dupre.
A long way!
What the hell...?
!
- You're such a creature of habit, Tommy.
- Who the hell are you?
- Get outta bed.
- l ain't got no clothes on.
Get outta bed!
I don't wanna shoot you lying down.
Who are you - the rent man?
Cos I'm all paid up. I swear. I'm not kiddin'.
- Come on, you can go ask Cosmo.
- Shut up!
- Where is she?
- Where's who?
- Your sister.
- Huh!
Lula?
Look, I don't know. I don't know, I swear!
I was just waiting to see her on the news.
What'd I tell you?
Check it out.
The sound's busted.
Looks like they're gonna find her before you do, pal!
is that what you think?
It's not what I think.
I miss her, Tommy.
I miss her so bad!
That's why I came back.
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Everything I see, I see her.
Jesus, man!
You're bleeding.
Even ugliness is beautiful... because of her.
- OK, what are you doing?
- You set us up, Tommy.
You sold us out to the fbi!
Dupre?
Neighbours heard a gunshot, but nobody checked it out.
Patrol guys responded this morning to an anonymous 911 and found him here.
Except the rats found him first.
The victim's name was Thomas Phillips.
That's Lula's brother.
There's not a lot of family resemblance left, between the rats and the .45 in the face!
- Oh, I hate this nicotine stuff.
- What's his story?
Oh, he's single.
He's lived here alone for the past seven months.
A few priors - small stuff, mostly.
B and E, narcotics possession.
Nothing like his big sister.
- Was the TV on when they found him?
- No.
Why?
I don't think Tommy was much of a reader, since he doesn't have any books.
From the position of the body, I'd say maybe he was watching the tube when he was shot.
- Print kit's over there.
Knock yourself out!
- Get out of my way, Ace!
Regulations state, to gain access to a crime scene, you gotta show id!
Looks like you were right.
Excuse me.
Jack... ls there a problem here?
No, I just...
I don't have any id.
Would you tell this gentleman who I am?
Officer, this is Agent Jack Willis.
Violent Crimes Section of the Washington Bureau.
Come on, let's talk out here.
I was just doing my job, miss!
Willis, what happened?
!
Half the Bureau's been looking for you.
Where have you been?
I don't know. I just... wasn't myself.
I just kinda... woke up out on the street!
- l'm taking you back to the hospital.
- No way!
I'm staying right here!
- You're not ready to be here.
- Who says?
!
Jack, you're recovering from a major trauma.
It's a miracle you're even able to walk!
- This is Tommy Phillips' place, right?
- Jack...
Was he killed with a .45?
As a matter of fact, he was.
He was!
That's Lula's weapon of choice.
I know these people. I've been after them for a long time.
We're halfway there!
- You did open the book on this one.
- And I'll be there when it's closed!
All right.
But, as a colleague and as a friend, I recommend you have a full medical evaluation.
Physical and psychological.
All right, fair enough.
Jack!
Good to see you back among the living.
- lt's good to be back.
- Jack.
- So what have we got here?
- Mulder here found a print on the TV.
A partial oblique.
And it's not the victim's.
Good work, Agent Mulder. I'm impressed!
That's fancy shooting.
I gotta get re-certified before they give me my weapon back.
Well, by the looks of it, I wouldn't worry about re-certification.
- ls there anything else you wanted?
- Yeah, it's Scully's birthday.
I was wondering if you'd sign that for me.
Sure!
Be glad to.
Always glad to celebrate the good times.
There you go!
Happy birthday, Scully.
You're two months early.
It's from Willis. I thought you two had the same birthday?
- We do.
- Well, that's news to him.
I asked him to sign it.
And he signed it with his left hand.
You tested him.
Yeah.
After I found out evidence from the Phillips murder is missing.
- What evidence?
- The print we lifted.
Our best lead is gone.
Someone stole it before the lab had a chance to take a look at it.
- And you think Willis is responsible?
- l'm not sure Willis is Willis.
Can you at least accept the possibility that, during his near-death experience, psychic transference occurred?
Can't you accept the possibility that this isn't an X-File?
!
Aside from the expected level of post-trauma stress,
Jack passed both of his evaluations - physical and psychological.
Just because someone forgets a birthday, it doesn't mean that he's been possessed!
When I was studying for my medical boards, I forgot my birthday, too!
Did you forget how to sign your name?
This is a copy of the automobile requisition form Willis filed the day before he was shot.
Compare the signatures.
Like I said, Mulder - stress.
All right?
It can significantly affect someone's cursive standard.
I'm afraid this doesn't prove a thing.
Agent Willis here.
Jack?
- Where are you going?
- We got a break!
- A landlord thinks he's got our girl.
- Hotline?
Yeah.
Saw her picture in the post office.
There's the address.
- Jack, can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.
The Phillips murder.
The print Mulder lifted off the TV. lt's missing.
And?
And you were carrying the evidence back.
Are you implying something, Agent Scully?
I don't know anything about any missing print.
Now, I'm ten minutes away from closing the biggest case of my career.
Are you coming?
- What's the apartment number again?
- 202.
Oh, yeah.
- What was this guy's name?
- Multrevich.
Multrevich?
All right, all right, all right!
Mr Multrevich, I'm from the fbi.
Jack Willis.
- We spoke on the phone, right?
- Oh, yeah.
Have you ever seen this lady?
Yeah. 207.
Two days ago.
First and last month - cash.
- Where's 207?
- Down the hallway.
We want you to go back inside your apartment and stay away from the windows.
Thanks.
Where's our backup?
You said you called them, right?
Should've been here ten minutes ago.
She may be running down a fire escape!
I'm gonna call in again.
Look!
That's her!
- Where is she?
Where'd she go?
!
- l'll check back here.
Face down!
Face down!
Hands behind your back!
Now!
She's all yours, Jack.
Yeah...
Like a dog on a leash.
I already cuffed her.
They're for you, Scully.
Put 'em on.
- What's going on, Jack?
- Put 'em on.
Or I'll blow you in half.
Jack...
Shut up!
Put 'em on!
Come on, baby.
Come on, get up, baby.
Look at you...
Your face is all dirty.
- Keep your stinking hands off me!
- Baby!
You ain't gonna believe where l've been.
Sure it's crazy.
You don't think I know it's crazy?
This isn't my face!
These aren't my hands!
But it's me in here!
And I know you.
I know everything about you, baby.
Come on, ask me something.
Your birthday is April 7th.
Your favourite colour is red.
Come on...
Come on, ask me something else.
Come on, ask me!
OK...
OK, what did we do after we got married?
Right after?
- After that.
- Well... we went down to the beach.
I took out my buck knife and I sliced open my palm.
And then I slit open your palm.
And we let the blood drip down in the water.
- Then what did you say to me?
- l said
"This is so we can be married in all the oceans of the world."
And then I made you a solemn oath.
To never take this ring off my finger.
Ever!
And I mean to keep that promise.
This is...
This is just too weird!
I can't believe it's really you!
Don't worry, baby.
It won't make any difference in the dark.
- We'll be in touch.
- When do I get my reward?
We'll call you.
Now I'm worried. 12 hours with no word?
I don't get it.
Why's her car still sitting out front?
Why didn't Willis call for backup?
Because it wasn't Willis who answered the hotline.
- You heard the recording. lt was his voice.
- Forget it, Bruskin.
Plus which... the manager just lD'd him and Scully.
I said, forget it, Bruskin!
This isn't one of your X-File theories, is it?
It doesn't matter what I think.
We're still after the same thing.
- Mulder.
- fbi centrex operator.
Please hold.
- Yeah.
- Guess who, Ace.
Willis?
!
That depends on who you ask, don't it?
Where's Scully?
You're the fbi!
You figure it out!
Let me talk to her.
Yeah, sure.
- Mulder...
- Dana, are you OK?
- Don't...
- Dana?
OK!
That's it!
Goodbye!
It's not gonna work, Jack.
You don't think so?
Bureau policy prohibits negotiating with kidnappers.
But you already know that, don't you, Jack?
Stop calling me that!
Your name is Jack Willis.
You were born February 23rd, 1957.
- You live at 51 Stanhope...
- My name is Warren James Dupre!
And I was born in Clammouth Falls, Oregon, in the Year of the Rat!
We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens.
You taught me how to fish through the ice.
It was your parents' cabin.
Jack, try to remember.
We drove up in a snowstorm.
Come on, Jack!
Don't think I didn't see what you did!
I was like a little slip of paper, up there on that hospital ceiling.
- l saw everything.
- What did you see?
You left me to die on that table, while you tried to save your friend!
- You are my friend!
- Too bad he was gone already.
I watched him go.
Just saw him slip away down that long, black tunnel.
No.
We brought you back.
You shot me dead!
And then you let me die.
No.
You won't kill me, Jack.
You call me that one more time, and I'll make you stone cold.
Easy, baby.
Easy!
Not yet.
Remember, she's our ticket.
Hey!
- Got any more of this soda?
- You just drank the last of it.
Soda...?
How much of that have you had?
- What's it to you?
- Jack Willis is diabetic.
Which means that you are.
Too much sugar in the system could lead to hyperglycaemia.
Maybe that's why your stomach's hurting so bad.
Abdominal pain is the first sign of impending diabetic coma.
You need insulin.
I feel myself getting into their heads, and I'm scared by what I'm feeling.
The intoxicating freedom that comes from disconnecting action and consequence.
Theirs is a world where nothing matters but their own needs, their own impossible appetites.
And while the pleasure they derive from acts of violence is clearly sexual, it also speaks to what Warden Jackson called their "operatic devotion to each other".
It's a love affair...
I almost envy.
Cadenceville PD just reported a drugstore was broken into here, on the corner of Old Forge Road and Madison.
I'm betting that Scully is somewhere within this five-mile radius.
- Am I missing something?
!
- 200 units of NPH insulin were taken.
Willis is diabetic.
Get me a census report.
Let's see how many households we're talking about.
Quick, quick, quick!
My legs are starting to go numb!
Hold on...
- What the hell...?
- Drop the needle.
- Without this medicine, he dies.
- Yeah!
So you said.
Now... put it down.
Unless you want me to put you down with it.
What the hell are you doing?
I need that medicine!
- You still haven't figured it out, have you?
- Figured what out?
It wasn't my brother who set you up!
You?
!
Yeah...
Me.
How do you think I got away so clean?
The minute you stepped into that bank, I was out of there.
I got the money and I got rid of you!
At least, I thought I did.
Tactical room.
This is it!
Mulder.
- Listen carefully.
- Where's Willis?
- Oh, he's here somewhere.
- Let me talk to Scully.
Not this time.
We don't deal unless we know Scully's alive.
She's alive.
She's not happy, but... she's alive.
You listen to me.
You lay one hand on Scully, and so help me God... lf l were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.
Cos if you ever wanna see Scully again, it's gonna cost you a million dollars.
Have it by this time tomorrow.
I'll tell you when and where.
We got it. lt's a 202 number.
- Great!
- lt's coming through.
- Here it is.
- Get the address.
- Forget it.
- Why?
It's Scully's cellular number.
They're using her phone.
We can't trace them.
She's not happy, but... she's alive.
If I were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.
- That last part?
- Yeah.
Squelch the voice even more.
Yeah.
Done.
If I were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.
Yep.
Yep!
There's something there.
Definitely something at the high end.
Let me throw on an extra Z-14 filter...
and isolate everything over half a decibel.
If I were you, I'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat.
There.
That engine sound.
Let's clean it up some more!
If I were you, I'd stop talking and... ls that a small plane?
Taking off, by the sound of it.
Give me a minute to guess the altitude within 200ft!
Great!
All right, people!
Settle down, grab a seat.
Mulder says he's got something.
What?
An alien virus, or new information on the Kennedy assassination?
Hey, Mulder's all right.
Pay attention, you might learn something from the man.
From our last phone contact, we've identified what sounds like light aircraft.
Now, Washington County Regional Airport happens to fall within our area.
Since takeoffs are north to south, it's a fair bet that our target area lies along this flight path.
For those who remember math, that gives us an area of three square miles to cover.
Roughly 1,000 households.
With 100 law enforcement officials, at about 30 households per man per hour, we can canvass the entire area in three hours.
Bruskin will grid the target area and divide it among the teams.
For those of you... who don't know already, this one's important to me.
So...
let's do it right.
Thanks.
Let me see Steinberg, Calder, Westin, Stipley and Mackowitz...
Scully?
Was there snow?
Yes...
Jack.
There was lots of snow.
- l can't...
- lt was December.
It was the weekend after Thanksgiving.
I remember... a red stove.
Yeah...
That's right.
There was a...
There was a wood-burning stove right in the middle of the room.
Cold?
- Yeah.
- So cold... I remember...
I had to wrap you in a blanket when the wood ran out.
Yeah.
No...
Jack!
Don't close your eyes.
Come on, keep talking.
Jack, keep talking!
Come on!
Down on the floor, now!
Now, or you're dead!
- l'm gonna execute every one of you!
- No!
No!
Shut up and do it!
Just a second!
Who is it?
It's Brother Tate.
Could I speak with you for just one moment, please?
What do you want?
Just a few minutes of your time, ma'am.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
I wonder if I can interest you in the word of the Lord?
- Leather-bound, in black or red.
Your choice.
- Go away!
This is One Four.
Target sighted.
Well...
I guess it's time to make that call.
He's dead.
It's all on you now.
He's dead because of you.
Well...
Guess it's over.
Whoever you are.
Don't move!
- Jack!
- Shut up!
I love you.
Don't you know?
You're why I came back.
This is Westin.
They've battened down the hatches.
No clear shot from this side.
What about you guys?
Ditto.
Hold your positions and keep radios at two.
- How do we look?
- Backup's in.
- But we still don't know what's going on.
- We will soon enough.
I kept a bottle of medicine in the other room. I'll go get it.
What do you say, huh?
I'll get it for you.
Look!
Look!
Look!
Look, I love you.
- l love you, baby.
- No...
Listen!
Listen, we... we still have her.
We can get away with this.
I don't think so, baby.
Not this time.
Jack, put the gun down!
You remember that... that light that I talked about?
- No...
- lt's beautiful.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
- No!
- fbi!
Freeze!
Jack!
fbi!
Scully.
Are you OK?
Jack?
!
Hi. I got this from the morgue, along with the rest of his personal effects.
I thought you might want it.
"Happy 35th.
Love D."
I got it for him three years ago.
Next of kin?
No.
Jack was an only child.
His parents died when he was in college.
There's a... kid over in Parklawn.
Jack's been his big brother, so I'm going to go and see him tomorrow.
- What am I gonna tell him?
- The official story.
Which is?
Fugitive Lula Phillips died in a shoot-out with federal agents.
It also resulted in the death of Special Agent Jack Willis - killed in the line of duty.
What am I supposed to tell myself?
Good night.
It's not working. lt stopped.
At 6.47.
The exact time that Jack went into cardiac arrest at the hospital.
What does that mean?
It means... lt means whatever you want it to mean.
Good night.
Visiontext Subtitles by Stephanie Donohue
I made this!
english
Lauren, I've been looking every...
Are you all right?
- Do you want some water or...
- No, l-l'm fine.
Oh, honey, it's been a couple of weeks now.
- Do you wanna talk?
- No.
Really, Jane, I'm OK. I just haven't known a lot of people who've died.
I've never known anybody that killed themselves.
Oh, well, maybe once everything gets packed away, it'll get easier, there won't be the constant reminder.
Here's your paycheck.
Oh, come on... go home.
OK.
I have no money!
No, let me go!
No!
Food.
I think I'll pass.
Hey, I know a good place to crash.
Up the fire escape, through that window.
Come on, I'll give you a boost.
Pull it down.
- l can't get it down.
- Come on, pull!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.
Chief Blevins assures us of your cooperation.
We regret any inconvenience.
We hope your expertise in extraordinary phenomenon will help us answer some questions.
You're not fbi, are you?
Have you ever analysed anything like this before?
Abnormal postmortem muscle reflex.
Both corpses are still responding to exposure to high levels of electrostatic charge.
Any external lesions or surface burns?
- None.
- Time of death?
Well, it can't be long.
The body's still warm.
Somatic death occurred sometime over six hours ago, but their body temperatures have yet to drop below 98.3 degrees.
Where did you find them?
Tell us the time and mode of transport.
It might help us determine why the bodies haven't cooled.
Hey, you guys called us down here.
You want some answers, you gotta give some.
They travelled 60 minutes by air.
Thank you.
The most troubling aspect of the deaths is the throat area.
Larynx, oesophagus and hyoid bone were crushed like chalk.
There's no abrasions or evidence of tissue damage.
It's as if their throats were crushed from the inside.
Who are these guys?
If you've done your examinations, why are you consulting us?
During your work on the X-Files, ever seen anything like this?
No, never.
Thank you very much for your time, Agent Mulder, Scully.
If any inquiry as to this meeting be made, we request full denial.
I'd say you people already suffer from full denial.
You lied.
You have seen it before, I can tell.
You lied to them.
I would never lie.
I wilfully participated in a campaign of misinformation.
Who do you think they were?
NSA, cia, some organisation Congress will uncover in the next scandal.
But what's important is what they have.
They have no idea because they called us in.
I have X-Files.
Each case has an element of what we saw.
Electrostatic charge, internal mutilation with no external causality.
None has all the elements in one case.
How can an oesophagus be crushed without the neck being touched?
Psychokinetic manipulation.
Psychokinesis?
You mean, how Carrie got even at the prom?
The Russians were doing studies on it.
The Chinese still are.
Their findings are kept secret.
OK, I'm intrigued.
But how can we investigate?
We have nothing to go on.
Just getting in, Lauren?
Oh!
Yes.
Mr Graves used to let you get away with that, but Mr Dorlund is in charge now.
I wondered if I could have a minute with him.
Tomorrow at three.
Can I see him today?
It's really important.
is everything all right out here?
Can I speak with you?
Please.
I'm here to give my two-week notice.
Lauren, Jane told me about you crying in Howard's office and I...
I want you to know you're not alone.
As a matter of fact, we share something special.
Howard and I started this company ten years ago, and as long as I knew him, he had no interest in anything but work, and so some of us became family.
I was his brother and you were like a daughter to him so, of course, I feel very close to you.
And I... I wanna take care of my family.
Stay, Lauren, please.
The company needs you, especially now.
I won't let you leave!
What's wrong?
I...
I can't. I have to leave.
I...
I can't be here anymore.
You've got two weeks.
Mohammed Amrollahi.
Convictions: illegal possession of firearms, illegal possession of explosives, falsification of export licences.
He has ties to an exiled extremist group - the Isfahan.
Named after a city in Iran, they've been working out of Philadelphia...
That's 60 air minutes.
I'll talk to the Philly PD.
It was last Wednesday night.
I was just on routine patrol.
This is where we found 'em.
- Who discovered their bodies?
- Nobody.
It was about 10. I was on patrol.
Saw them hangin' around.
No witnesses?
The people that come here after business hours don't witness very much, know what I'm sayin'?
I appreciate your help.
A daily visual record is made of everyone who makes a transaction.
We'll just have to question everyone who was at the machine before 10 that night.
There.
Back up.
"Lauren Kyte, 858 Franklin, Bensalem."
Why would the Isfahan rob someone of 40 bucks at an ATM machine?
Look at that!
Maybe it's another person.
Maybe... maybe not.
Well, the resolution's too poor.
It won't help much to enhance it.
That leaves us only one person we know we can talk to.
Come on.
Hello?
Ms Lauren Kyte, please.
I'm Agent Fox Mulder, this is Agent Dana Scully.
We're with the fbi.
Do you mind if we come in?
- l was just in the middle of...
- Thank you.
We won't be long.
Ever seen either of these two men before?
No.
Take your time.
l-l'm sorry, I've never seen them before.
I'm afraid you have.
It's a surveillance picture from your ATM.
Can you tell us what happened that night?
These guys...
l-l was depositing my paycheck, they grabbed me, I got away, I ran.
l-l just didn't wanna file a report.
They were found dead.
Have you ever seen this person before?
No.
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.
Does that mean you know?
lt-it means I... I can't tell you who it is.
When you can tell me, this is a number I can be reached at any time.
OK?
A woman her size breaking free and outrunning those men?
Then somehow crushing their necks?
She knows who the other person is.
She's packing, running away.
From what?
What's happening?
What the hell's going on?
Hang on!
You OK?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Paramedics check you out?
I'm fine, though I have a standing-in-line-at-the-DMV-sized headache.
Mine's more lRS-sized.
- They check out the car?
- Yeah. lt's brand-new, only 100 miles.
Then someone tampered with it while we were in her house.
Mechanic says everything's in order - nothing cut, nothing greased.
Check out the lights.
They're on.
No, the filaments are heated due to huge levels of electrostatic charge, like the bodies in the morgue.
Isn't it interesting that Lauren Kyte was present both times?
She was with us the entire time we were at her house.
What if it's possible somehow to raise the body's electrostatic charge to the levels we've seen and use that energy to affect objects?
If a person could generate that much energy, their body would break down, they'd start glowing.
There's evidence in the X-Files - furniture moving untouched, objects levitating, unexplained electrical discharges.
Frequently, people with psychokinetic power are unaware of their own capability.
Are you saying Lauren Kyte crashed our car?
Either that... or a poltergeist.
- They're here!
- They may be.
Oh, come on, Mulder, look at the tangible evidence.
Two Mid-East extremists were killed trying to assault a woman working for a manufacturer of parts for the Defense Department.
When we questioned her, our car was sabotaged.
Someone else may have committed both acts.
Maybe the same someone we saw in the ATM photos.
The mystery isn't psychokinetic energy, it's her accomplice.
Excuse me, sir...
She's clean.
No arrests, not even a traffic ticket.
Only thing is, she's in deep with her credit card company. $15,000.
What do you think you're doing?
What are you doing?
No, no.
I'll take care of this, all right?
Just go!
Here. l-l'll talk to someone.
A little upset over losing a parking space, wouldn't you say?
So who is Howard Graves, anyway?
She was his secretary.
That's three people dead in the last month associated with Lauren Kyte.
You won't find too many people at their boss's grave who aren't dancing on it.
Look at this one.
Excuse me.
Sir, is there an office where l can get some information on those people?
Who?
I attend every funeral.
I'm the last person to see them put to rest.
Do you know how Sarah Lynn was related to Howard Graves?
His daughter.
They were at home one day and he didn't latch the pool gate.
She drowned.
His wife left him a year later.
She's buried in a plot in the northeast corner.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
She was only three years old.
If she'd lived, she'd be Lauren's age.
Further investigation into Lauren's history reveals an estrangement from her family.
Phone records confirm no contact with her parents for two years.
Her actions, during surveillance, indicate a strong relationship between Lauren and her employer, the late Howard Graves.
Did this relationship somehow motivate his suicide?
How are the attack and the subsequent murders of the Isfahan agents related, if at all?
I am certain the answers to these questions lie in finding the identity of Lauren's accomplice.
Enhance it by 10.
That's Howard Graves.
He's alive.
Not necessarily.
No...
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Don't do this to me!
Howard?
No!
No!
Stop!
No, no!
Please, no!
Howard!
They killed him!
I think Howard Graves fabricated his own death.
Do you know how difficult it is to fake your own death?
Only one man has pulled it off
- Elvis!
He and Lauren are in on something.
Maybe an illegal dealing, something the ClA was interested in.
You may be right.
Wait!
You think I'm right?
Sure.
All you gotta do is prove Howard Graves is still alive.
Howard Graves is very dead.
May we see the autopsy report, please?
Knock yourself out.
"Cause of death - arterial haemorrhage."
Four out of six litres of blood down the tub.
There seems to be some blood work missing here.
We only do that if we suspect homicide.
I don't suppose you ran dental confirmations?
- What for?
It was him.
- How did you know?
It said so on the toe tag.
Who made positive id on the body?
Lauren Kyte.
But Graves was cremated.
There's no way to run a dental check or get a DNA sample.
Yes, there is.
His body's tissues and organs were donated.
Howard Graves is in five different people.
They harvested the organs immediately after death.
His kidneys went to Boston, his liver to Dallas and his corneas to Oregon.
They've all been transplanted.
We only cryo-preserved the dura mater - the membrane of the spinal column.
We have Graves' hospital records.
We'll extract a sample and, in two hours, confirm the identity of the donor.
I... made them rush so you could have your check before you leave.
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.
Aw, what?
Here.
Bye.
You were gonna leave without saying goodbye?
Well, I came to say goodbye and to wish you luck.
And to leave you with this little thought.
I know Howard told you, and if it ever gets out, I won't waste my time trying to pin the source.
I'll go straight to you.
And you'll do to me what you did to Howard?
- l know you had him killed.
- Why would you say that?
He told me.
Mulder.
Lauren Kyte.
How soon can you be at my house?
- Why?
- Please hurry.
The tests are conclusive.
The dura mater does belong to Graves.
He is indeed very dead.
Just a second.
- Go run the bath.
- Get out of here!
No!
No, no!
Stop!
Sto-o-op!
No!
You know, you're not under arrest.
You're just here for questioning.
The sooner you talk to us, the sooner you get to go home.
What happened to those people tonight?
Do you have any idea who they might be?
Why did they attack you?
Do you know who this is?
Scully, Mulder.
He'll keep an eye on her.
Come on.
Now.
You've seriously compromised our investigation.
We followed leads pertaining to an X-File.
I wanna know every detail concerning this case.
What case?
You withheld information.
Why not tell us what you've got?
Then we have nothing more to talk about.
Wait.
HTG Industrial Technologies sold restricted parts to the Isfahan.
Serial numbers were recovered in the July bombing of a navy transport van.
- How was Lauren involved?
- We don't know.
You impeded our investigation.
We don't have enough evidence to hold her.
If she doesn't talk, she goes free.
We lose our chance to break this.
I could make her talk.
My advice to you, don't get rough with her.
That was a waste of time.
Your turn.
- Lauren...
- l won't talk to you either.
OK... then you're free to go.
I can't go back to that house.
Why?
Because of Howard Graves?
- He's dead.
- l know.
He's watching over you, isn't he?
I don't know if you've ever been a secretary before.
Sometimes your boss can talk as if you weren't even in the room, which can hurt, you know.
But sometimes... you're all he has to talk to, which was how it always was with me and Howard.
One night, late, I went into his office.
He was crying.
More scared than sad.
Pentagon contracts were being cancelled, the company was going under.
He felt personally responsible for each of his employees.
Seeing and feeling their fear every day really wore him down.
And this one time,
Dorlund came with that group, that...
Mid-East group.
Isfahan.
That terrorist group.
They buy parts at an outrageous price.
Not just once, but for as long as they could get away with it.
That night Howard was crying.
He'd found out Isfahan had claimed responsibility for killing a couple of sailors in Florida.
He was never the same and I thought...
that's why he killed himself.
But he didn't.
I saw...
Howard showed me how Dorlund had him killed.
Made it look like a suicide.
He could see Howard was gonna put an end to the deal.
So now Howard is protecting you?
- lt sounds so ridiculous.
- But you believe it.
He was closer to me than my father.
I told him that.
I still feel his presence.
Sometimes... I even smell his aftershave.
If you just could've seen the things I've seen.
But I just... want all that to go away.
That's why I'm leaving.
Maybe he can move on.
That's not enough.
You have been given the chance to tell him again.
Take it.
Tell him you love him... by showing him, by by helping us finish his unfinished business.
Lauren, how will you ever be able to rest if he never can?
OK.
I'm a mess.
I'm gonna... freshen up.
What are you doing, Scully?
You don't believe.
Mulder, there's no such thing as ghosts or psychokinesis.
I'm sure there's an explanation, but I believe she believes.
My priority is to get her to help us stop Dorlund.
We may have just sacrificed our best chance to observe spectral phenomena.
No, I'm giving us the chance to solve a case that's tangible instead of chasing after shadows.
- Get in line!
- Yes, sir.
You ready?
All right, everyone.
We have a warrant to search the premises for evidence pertaining to the sale of restricted parts.
Evidence may be in the form of falsified export licences, parts manifests, communiqués.
If could be on computer disk or hard copy.
If in doubt, ask.
We need this to be clean.
This is the culmination of a year-long investigation.
If we don't come out with something proving a link to the Isfahan, this guy could walk.
OK, let's go!
You OK?
It'll most likely be in Dorlund's office.
We'll execute the search, but we'll need you to guide us so you have to be strong, OK?
Everybody, stay calm.
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.
Ma'am, could you back away from those files, please?
Step aside, please.
This is all we could find.
We don't have him.
He's not even breaking a sweat.
Our case is blown.
We wasted a year.
This guy is gonna walk.
Let's get outta here.
Lauren, it's over.
We have to go.
What we're looking for isn't here.
Look, she's no agent.
I don't want to be combative, but she has no right to destroy my property!
Destroying property?
What about that van that blew up killing those men?
!
What are you talking about, you stupid bitch?
Lauren, no!
Don't kill him!
Help us find it!
Get down!
Mulder!
Oh, my God!
I guess what we're looking for is here.
The US Attorney's office is going after Dorlund with all they've got, including the murder of Howard Graves.
I'll come back to testify.
Where are you going?
Away from here.
Thanks.
Boy, she's in a rush to get outta here.
Out of here or away from the ghost of Howard Graves?
Hey, Scully, do you believe in an afterlife?
I'd settle for a life in this one.
Have you ever seen the Liberty Bell?
Yes.
I've been to Philly a hundred times and never seen it.
You're not missing much. lt's a big bell with a crack and you have to wait in a long line.
Yeah, but I'd really like to go.
Why now?
I don't know.
How late do you think they stay open?
Miss Kyte, I asked for this 25 minutes ago.
I know. I'm sorry.
Maybe that's the way they work back East.
Here punctuality is a virtue.
We have to find new office space - every time a truck goes by, the whole building shakes!
That's all, Lauren.
Visiontext Subtitles by Pam Atkinson
I made this!
english
Yes.
- Love you.
- And I love you.
- Hello.
- Morning, sir.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Cecil.
- Top o' the morning to yeh.
Oh, thank you.
- Goodbye, darling!
- Goodbye, Charles!
- What time can I expect you?
- Before supper.
Oh!
I forgot what it was like to spend a day in court.
That's one of the luxuries to hunting down aliens and genetic mutants.
You rarely get to press charges.
- lt's open.
- What?
- lt's unlocked.
- That's weird.
- l'm sure I locked it.
- Must be an X-File.
What's that?
I told you I locked the door.
What do you think it is?
Ten to one, you can't dance to it.
Greetings, Agent Mulder.
Six months ago, British MP Reggie Ellicott received a cassette like the one you're listening to now.
Unfortunately, when he popped the tape into the stereo he armed a device which, when he tried to exit the car, created an explosion heard five miles away.
The Scotland Yard forensic team could only identify the poor bastard by dental records.
If only he hadn't reached for the handle and triggered the detonator!
But how was he to know he was sitting on enough plastic explosive to lift the car 40 feet and deposit the engine block on top of a three-storey building?
Aren't we looking rather ghostly?
It's an old friend.
- Aren't you going to thank me?
- For what?
Saving your life.
One tends not to make the same mistake twice.
- l'll try to remember that.
- You left your sense of humour
- in Oxford ten years ago?
- lt's one of the few things you didn't drive a stake through.
You know, some mistakes are worth making twice.
Dana Scully, this is Phoebe Green, terror of Scotland Yard.
- Hello.
- Hello.
She hates me.
What brings you to the colonies?
Some clever bloke has been giving the aristocracy a good scare.
Killed off a ranking MP or three for good measure.
Set Windsor Castle ablaze in 1992.
- Your car bomber?
- This one likes to burn his victims alive.
Can't figure out how he does it either.
Not a crumb of evidence at the crime scene.
The last one died in his front garden, his poor wife watching helplessly as he went up in smoke.
The Irish Republican Army?
Our suspect likes to send love letters to his victims' wives.
Sent one to the wife of Sir Malcolm Marsden a month ago.
Three days later he narrowly escaped a fire in his garage, burned down.
So they're renting a place out on Cape Cod, bringing the family for an extended holiday.
- Or until we catch the dirty bugger.
- He's that determined?
Judging by his success, he takes a certain delight in his work.
So what brings you on this detour to Washington DC, Inspector?
I figured my friend Mulder... couldn't resist a three-pipe problem.
I'll run it by our arson specialist.
Splendid.
I'll call London, let them know.
Oh, goodbye.
Three-pipe problem?
- From Sherlock Holmes. lt's a private joke.
- How private?
We knew each other at school in England.
She was brilliant and... I got in over my head and I... paid the price.
Mulder, you just keep unfolding like a flower.
It was over ten years ago, Scully.
Yeah.
You couldn't drop everything fast enough to help her out.
I was merely extending her a professional courtesy.
Oh, is that what you were extending?
I am going to run this by the arson guys, then she's on her own.
Something tells me you're not going to get rid of her that easily.
Beautiful!
Oh, just beautiful!
Look at that.
Salmon-red flames.
This is 1400, 1500 degrees.
This is a work of art.
Was there any kind of incendiary device used?
Yes, actually.
The victim's body.
- Spontaneous combustion?
- He was murdered.
However, we've no evidence that tells us how he caught fire.
That's peculiar.
People don't normally just catch on fire.
I mean, we burn, but we don't conduct all that well.
There's usually some extraneous fuel involved, like candle wax, gasoline, something flammable and incendiary that adheres to skin.
- Like an accelerant?
- Like an accelerant!
Yes!
But we found no trace, save for magnesium at two sites.
That's aliphatic pyrolysis, a residue from an exothermic reaction.
There's no evidence of the source.
No pore pattern or ignition devices.
There have been some arson fires in Seattle lately, and Pennsylvania.
They burn so hot the firemen can't put them out. 7,000 degrees.
- Hosing that down makes it worse.
- How's that?
Well, the... reaction is so intense that it splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen.
Just adds fuel to the fire.
- What were they using?
- We don't know for sure.
Could be rocket fuel.
That burns so hot and clean there's never a trace left.
You see, it's very difficult to prove arson.
It's driving the insurance companies nuts.
That's about the only explanation that I can give you.
There are cases of pyrokinetics, people who can control and conduct fire.
Well, I've seen fire bend around corners.
I've seen it bounce like a rubber ball.
Fire's got a certain genius, you know, a certain... demon poetry.
It's like it's got a mind of its own.
But I've never seen one that can defy the laws of physics.
Not when you figure it out.
You've... got quite a case for yourself here, Mulder.
I almost wish I could be in your shoes.
Hey, Jackson!
- Boy, that's a nice house!
- What a pleasant surprise!
Welcome to America, Sir Malcolm.
In here, please.
And over there as well.
But the second one I want upstairs.
Gentlemen, the second set of boxes will go directly up the stairs.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
I'm Bob, the caretaker.
- We've been exchanging letters.
- Oh, hello, Bob!
Excuse the paint.
Hi.
- Just trying to spruce the place up for you.
- Well, it's delightful.
- The photos don't do itjustice.
- Anything I can do for you, anything at all, you just holler.
Thank you, Bob.
- He seems like a rather nice fellow.
- Very.
My God, darling!
That painting rather looks like you.
Do you think?
Oh, I don't know.
Bloody little cur!
I'll skin you alive!
You see?
I'm the caretaker now.
So, Sherlock, is the game afoot?
Afraid so, Watson.
But you're off the hook on this one.
What do you mean?
I'm not going to put you through this.
- Put me through what?
- Phoebe's little mind game.
What are you talking about?
There's something else I haven't told you about myself, Scully.
I hate fire.
Hate it.
I'm scared to death of it.
When I was a kid, my best friend's house burned down.
I had to spend the night in the rubble, to keep away looters.
For years I had nightmares about being trapped in a burning building.
- And Phoebe knows about this?
- This is classic Phoebe Green.
Mind-game player extraordinaire.
Ten years, and then she shows up with a case like this.
She shows up knowing the power she has over you and makes you walk through fire.
Phoebe is fire.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you out on this one?
Sooner or later, a man's gotta face his demons.
Hello.
You're the Marsdens' driver?
Who's that?
Bob.
The caretaker.
Oh.
Yeah.
- Bum a smoke?
- Yeah, sure.
- l'm going into town.
Can I get you anything?
- Some cough medicine, if it's no problem.
Syrup or...
lozenges?
Syrup'd be good.
Can I give you some money?
I appreciate that!
Beer.
They don't let you bring your own around here.
I guess they'll just have to make an exception... won't they?
You're English!
God, I just love that accent!
Allow me.
A gentleman, to boot.
Oh, my God!
Now, that is a trick!
Hey, guys!
Take a look at this!
Care for a light?
I pulled this report off the wire.
A customer in a bar caught fire, but they're still looking for a body.
Any indication an accelerant was used?
The bar is across from a fire station.
Burned down before they could respond.
It turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake.
This is a woman who was in the bar.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Miss Gotchek?
- Yes.
I'm Special Agent Mulder from the fbi.
This is Inspector Green.
- Can you tell us what happened in the bar?
- There was this guy.
I'd had a few drinks, so...
He sat next to me and he did this thing.
It was like a magic trick where he lit his finger on fire.
When I turned around he was up in flames.
- Can you describe him?
- Good-looking, I think.
Brownish hair.
- Long hair?
Short hair?
- l've already told the police.
Could you work with an artist and come up with a sketch?
- l had a few drinks.
- Can I get your name and address?
See... I live with someone.
- He thinks I was at school last night.
- lt's no problem.
You can come down to the field office and work with somebody.
I'll give you a minute to think about it, OK?
Deftly done, Agent Mulder.
Casually disregard her indiscretion.
Firm but polite until she co-operates.
A technique I refined in my relationship with you.
Oh. I see you haven't lost your sense of humour.
I'm sorry.
That was a cheap shot.
I don't want to dredge up the past.
- Let's just stick to the case.
- Let's.
- Look, Phoebe...
- Unless I'm mistaken ten years seems time to have forgiven if not forgotten
- a few youthful indiscretions.
- l'm cursed with a photographic memory.
Then don't you tell me that you've forgotten a certain youthful indiscretion atop Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tombstone on a misty night in Windlesham.
Like I said, let's just stick to the case.
It occurred to me that we're going to a lot of trouble to find the description of a man who was burnt to a crisp.
I would agree, but they haven't found a body yet.
So, can we count on you?
Yeah.
OK.
I don't know if it matters but I remembered something else about the guy who caught fire.
He had an English accent.
Having a rough time, huh?
Maybe it's the cough syrup.
After reviewing the files of the Scotland Yard arson murders, two points remain unexplained.
One is the use of an untraceable accelerant.
The other involves the victims.
Since they all burned in the presence of family members in safe surroundings, this indicates unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist.
The arsonist is most likely a male, less than 25 years of age.
He will often act out of impulse, satisfying sexual urges or insecurities with destructive behaviour which compensates for social inadequacies or maladjustment.
- You boys want to see a magic trick?
- OK.
- What's your names?
- Michael.
And Jimmie.
- Doesn't he talk?
- Yes!
- What kind of magic trick?
- Maybe I'd better not.
- Show us!
- You might tell your mom and dad.
- We won't tell.
- Really?
- Promise?
- Promise.
Hope to die?
Stick a needle in your eye?
OK, boys.
You've taken the solemn oath of trust that can't be broken, except... under penalty of death.
Watch.
- ls it in there?
- No.
You're too smart for me!
- Where did it go?
- Where did it go?
- Where do you think, Jimmie?
- l don't know.
I think I remember.
- Do it again!
- You want me to do it again?
OK. I'll do it again.
Agent Beatty?
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.
- Can I steal a minute of your time?
- Yeah, sure.
Come in. I'm just working on this Mafia torch job here.
I'm... working with Agent Mulder.
Oh, yeah.
Wild case.
So, what can I do for you?
You said the arsonist might be using some kind of rocket fuel as an accelerant.
Just speculation. it doesn't explain how he sets bodies on fire.
What if he got some of this fuel into some hand cream, or...
Well, you've got to understand that even the smallest amounts of this stuff can produce temperatures over 5,000 degrees.
But I suppose it's not impossible.
Extremely diluted.
He'd still have to find a way to ignite it.
Wow!
It lit by itself!
Come on.
Sit down.
So...
- You guys ever smoked a cigarette?
- No, they're bad for you.
Would you like a puff, Michael?
- No.
- Make a man out of you.
- l don't want to.
- Why don't you hold one for me?
How about you, Jimmie?
Huh?
Little man?
Jimmie!
Michael!
Hello.
Bob...
We've had a bit of bad news.
Our driver has taken ill and we're due at a party in Boston this evening.
is there any chance that we can impose upon you to drive the family into town?
We'd be happy to pay you for your time and put you up for the night.
- l'd be very happy to do it as a favour.
- Good.
Thank you.
Boys, let's go.
Daddy's got lunch all ready.
The arsonist is usually unmarried and prone to obsessive fantasies about women or men inaccessible to him.
The setting of fires results from his cowardice and inability to develop a natural relationship.
His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned.
The suspicious nature of the fire last night strongly suggests the arsonist has followed Lord Marsden to the United States.
A check of all recent immigration to the northeastern area is under way.
It has become not a matter of if but when he will strike.
- Here's that immigration data you wanted.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Remember those reports about people who can control and conduct fire?
- Vaguely.
- This guy just told us he's far more exotic.
I should say so, if he can set himself on fire.
- What?
- l'm not used to someone so quick to agree.
- Oh.
- What protection does the family have?
- The driver's a very capable bodyguard.
- He should get more men and limit exposure.
There's a party in their honour tonight in Boston.
- They'll have to cancel.
- Unless you want to set a trap.
I had thought of that, but we must be careful and discreet.
The party's at eight, at the Venable Plaza.
I'll travel with the family.
Why don't you go on ahead and have a look around?
Oh, and I've taken a room at the hotel for the night.
Thanks.
Thank you.
- Mulder.
- lt's Scully.
Where are you?
- l'm in Boston.
- l've got something to show you.
- l'm going to come up there.
- What have you got?
I might have information on the identity of your arsonist.
- Are you there, Mulder?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Can I meet you somewhere?
It's just that I'm kind of anticipating having my hands full.
Hey!
We're here!
- Good evening.
- Thank you.
- Evening, sir.
- Hello.
Enjoying yourself?
Good food, witty conversation...
I'm having the time of my life.
I wondered if you think it's safe enough to indulge ourselves in a dance.
It doesn't look like your arsonist is going to make an appearance.
That doesn't mean there won't be any fires to put out.
I've thought about you often.
There's a fire upstairs!
- What?
- On the 14th floor.
That's where the children are.
You've got a fire on the 14th floor!
Help us!
Here we go!
We got one down!
Come on, buddy!
Come on!
- Can you walk?
- l got him.
- Here we are.
- Jimmie!
Michael!
You saved their lives!
- Who is he?
- He's the driver.
Well done!
Good job.
You were really out.
- Where's Phoebe?
- She's down the hall.
- What about the kids?
- OK.
The doctor checked them out.
What happened to you up there?
I panicked.
Couldn't move, Scully.
It could have happened to anyone.
Yeah.
But it happened to me.
I haired out.
Plain and simple.
What do you know about this guy that saved the kids?
The driver?
I checked him out prior to the Marsdens' arrival.
He's worked on the property for eight years.
No record.
His references checked out.
They were lucky he was here.
- Who was watching the kids tonight?
- He was.
I could have sworn I saw him in the hall about the time the fire broke out.
You couldn't have.
Anyway, our suspect is English.
Hey.
I came to see if you were OK.
- How are the kids?
- They're fine.
Everybody's anxious to get back.
- To the Cape?
- Only to pack.
They're travelling back to England the day after tomorrow.
And you?
I'll be leaving in a few days.
I'll give you a ring back at the Bureau before I leave.
Goodbye.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Are you at all interested in what I came all the way up here to show you?
Yeah.
Well, I did some checking on my own.
I didn't know a whole lot about arson or arsonists, so I took the opportunity.
For my own edification, of course.
I ran a profile of possible incendiary fuels and accelerants that could have been used in the crimes.
I also took the liberty of running a search through Interpol of all the gardeners and domestic help that were hired by the murder victims.
- And?
- And...
These people probably don't even tie their own shoes.
There were over 200 names, and not a duplicate... except one.
A Cecil Lively.
He worked as a gardener for two of the victims.
- What did you find on him?
- Nothing.
- So he's clean?
- Apparently, he was questioned by Scotland Yard and they released him.
But I dug a little further.
Cecil Lively is a documented citizen of Great Britain.
Paid his taxes, never been on the dole...
A model citizen.
Until he died in 1971 in a London tenement fire.
I know.
That's what I thought.
So, I checked a little further.
Cecil L'lvely, spelled L apostrophe, came up again. ln fact, it came up twice.
On a list of death certificates, among children who died in ritual sacrifice by a satanic cult in 1963 in the Toddingham Woods outside Bath, England.
- Where else did you find it?
- You're gonna love this.
On a list of recent visas issued by the British Government.
Cecil L'lvely's passport was stamped by US Immigration two weeks ago in Boston.
Call the local field office in Boston of the fbi and get them to fax you the composite the witness did.
Fax it to every local law enforcement agency.
- What are you gonna do?
- Try and catch Phoebe.
This guy could be waiting for them at Cape Cod.
Yes.
This is Special Agent Scully.
I've been waiting on hold for you guys to fax me a composite of an arson suspect.
Right.
Hang on a second.
It's coming through.
Thanks.
Oh, my God!
It's the driver.
The cellular customer you are trying to reach is out of the area.
Excuse me.
His name is Cecil L'lvely.
- Who?
- Your arsonist.
Where's the rest of the family?
- They went outside for a walk.
- Well, go find them.
We've got to get them packed and out of here.
Come on, hurry!
Let's go!
It's the driver.
I know.
He disappeared.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I found this out in the garage...
It's been very hard on the family.
Did you get the composite?
- Yes.
- l don't believe it. I can't believe it.
- He's worked for us for over ten years.
- Obviously there's been some mistake.
Oh.
Oh, my God!
- This isn't the driver!
It's the caretaker!
- He's upstairs with the children!
Michael!
Michael!
Jimmie!
Looks like we've found the missing driver.
Mulder!
In here, quickly!
- What's going on?
!
- They just went off - all by themselves!
My God!
- Oh, my God!
- Everybody out!
- l think he rigged the whole house.
- Oh, no!
It's fuel.
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Move!
Move!
Scully, find a fire extinguisher.
- Everybody else, out!
- What about the children?
I'll take care of the children.
Go!
- Are you going to be OK, Mulder?
- Oh, yeah. I'll be fine.
There's no place I'd rather be.
Michael!
Jimmie!
Are you in there?
Help!
Time to call 911?
Don't move!
Freeze!
Federal Agent.
You won't shoot me.
Stay right where you are!
See?
Cos you don't know the spark from that round won't blow this whole house to kingdom come.
Back off, Scully!
It's the accelerant!
Someone help us!
- Oh, my boys!
My babies!
- Michael!
Jimmie!
Thank God!
Thank God!
You can't kill me!
You can't fight fire with fire!
Care to take me to lunch?
Scare you?
You have no idea.
Where is Phoebe?
- l don't know.
- You don't know?
- She didn't call?
- No.
- She did messenger this to me last night.
- Did you play it?
- No.
- Why not?
Aren't you curious what's on it?
Ten to one you can't dance to it.
X-File number 11214893.
Addendum to the file opened by Special Agent Mulder.
The arson suspect, Cecil L'lvely, was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital with fifth and sixth degree burns over his entire body.
Military burns specialists have been brought in to study the case, which they're calling extraordinary, as the suspect not only survived, but also had rapid regeneration of his basal cell tissue.
Full recovery is anticipated in as little as a month.
L'lvely is being held in a high-security medical facility, confined to a hyperbaric chamber until he can be tried for the murder of a Massachusetts caretaker.
His body temperature remains at a steady 109 degrees.
Health technicians have removed anything flammable from his room due to several fires in the vicinity.
According to Agent Mulder, further incarceration remains a problem for federal penal authorities.
Can I get you anything, sir?
I'm just dying for a cigarette.

I made this!
english
Here.
Let me do it.
Put your number in, then your card.
What's your number, Roland?
Three fifteen.
See how easy it is?
- Engine efficiency?
- 94 percent.
We need more!
- How's the back pressure?
- What do you think?
Climbing.
lncrease the blade inclination.
- l said, increase the blade inclination!
- inclination is pi over nine!
We've reached maximum velocity.
No!
Let it go. lt will work!
The engine'll destroy itself!
I won't do that.
It's not going to destroy itself.
Come on!
We're almost there!
- Something's wrong with our equations.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
Surnow pulled the plug.
- l'm protecting the baby!
- And four years of work, Frank.
- Work that's going to add up to zilch.
Unless we show some progress, they're going to pull the plug on us, Ron.
- He's right.
You should've continued the test.
- Someone'll crack Mach 15. I want it to be us.
I won'tjeopardise everything because you two can't wait to see your name in print!
It's the print that gets the money, Ron.
If you want to go down in flames together, fine.
You go ahead.
I'm going to do the math.
Good night, Dr Keats.
What the hell?
!
Roland!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Roland, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
We have to open this door, Roland.
Stop typing!
Roland!
Roland!
Open the door!
What are you doing?
!
Open the door!
Roland, are you listening?
!
- How was the wedding?
- The part where the groom passed out
- or the dog bit the drummer?
- Did you catch the bouquet?
Maybe. ls that what you couldn't talk to me about over the phone?
The project they say doesn't exist does exist.
- The Icarus Project?
- The next generation in jet-engine design capable of doubling speeds using half the fuel.
At least in theory.
And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist
- who worked on it here at the university?
- Yes.
How close are they?
I'm not sure, but Surnow's the second scientist to die in the last six months.
OK.
But how is this an X-File?
You don't think this is about UFO technology?
There's something unexplainable, but not unidentifiable.
- Keats?
- There.
Dr Keats?
We're with the fbi.
Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.
We understand you discovered Dr Surnow.
What was left of him.
How do you suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel?
Someone must have shut him in.
- The door is operated from there.
- By computer?
I've already been through this with the police.
Another member of your team died recently. lsn't that correct?
Yes.
Arthur Grable.
He was killed in an automobile accident in November.
I'm Frank Nollette. I'm also on the project.
- Are you certain it was an accident?
- What are you driving at?
Your work seems to be a perfect target for industrial espionage.
Who wrote this?
Ron was working on it when I left.
The handwriting here doesn't seem to match any of the other handwriting.
It isn't mine.
What about Roland Fuller?
Roland's the... janitor.
According to the police report, he was the only other person here.
- Roland didn't do that.
- How do you know?
Let's just say Roland isn't exactly a rocket scientist.
Here.
Tracy.
With stars.
Roland?
There are some people here would like to talk with you.
I went off the paper.
- Sorry.
- That's all right, Roland.
Tracy.
Would you like to come help me in the TV room?
OK.
Hi, Roland.
Mind if we sit down?
Thanks.
Do you mind if we ask you a couple of questions?
Do you remember working last night?
Do you remember seeing anything unusual?
Seeing any strangers?
Did...
Did Dr Surnow or Dr Keats or Dr Nollette do anything unusual?
Nope.
You must like stars.
One hundred and forty-seven.
- Sorry?
- Stars.
You like numbers too, huh?
Roland, let me help you.
One... two... three... four... five... six...
- seven...
- Roland, is everything OK?
Roland, are you all right?
Eleven...
- Twelve... thirteen...
- What happened?
What did you say to upset him so?
!
Sixteen...
Seventeen... lt's definitely the work of a fourth individual.
The doctors' cursive standards don't match what you found on the white board.
Will you do me a favour and try this?
- What is it?
- Something Roland was doodling.
- You don't really think Roland...
- He was the only other person in the lab.
But we're talking about a sophisticated fluid dynamics equation.
Roland barely has an iq of 70.
You saw his facility with math.
Don't some autistic individuals display unusual abilities?
Yes, but even savants behave only as human calculators.
They can perform certain functions but they can't tell you the value of anything or the meaning.
I hate to take sides, but the bottom line is no.
The terminal stroke on the six, the roof on the five... I'm sorry.
He didn't write it.
An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees will freeze, exhibiting great tensile strength, but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact.
I've seen this demonstrated on a fish before.
I don't think they'll do this on Beakman's World.
Has this been dusted?
- Treat yourself.
- Thanks.
Hey, Scully!
Look at these files.
KMAN must be Keats.
This file was turned off at 12.31 last night.
But look.
Someone else entered a file under the name ARTHUR after 12.31.
And worked on it for nearly five hours.
Well, it couldn't have been Keats.
Judging from the rigor of the body, he was dead around 12.30.
So someone came in, killed Keats, and then just did some work on an old Dr Grable file?
I can't access the ARTHUR file.
We'll need the password.
Try... 15626.
How did you know that that...?
This is Arthur Grable's work on the same equations the others were working on.
Look at all those entries.
Someone has been continuing his work since he died.
How did you know what the password was?
Wave goodbye!
Wave goodbye!
Wave goodbye!
Bye-bye!
Wave goodbye!
Roland?
Why did you sleep in your clothes?
Well, let's get you dressed.
You have visitors.
I'm not supposed to talk to them.
Who told you that?
Remember that talk we had about being shy?
These are nice people, Roland.
Hey, Roland, you've got more shirts than I do.
This one would look stylin' today.
What do you think?
- The green one.
- The green one?
Please.
Mrs Stodie, can I talk to you a second?
See you later, Roland.
This one?
There you go.
- Do you like yourjob at the college, Roland?
- Yes.
I hear you're very good at it.
Do you remember how you got yourjob?
A man talked to Mrs Stodie.
What man?
Dr Grable.
Was Dr Grable nice to you?
Yes.
When did you last speak to him?
Last week?
The day before?
Dr Grable died.
I'm sorry.
People die.
They go away.
And they're not supposed to come back.
Has Roland ever mentioned the name Arthur?
That was Dr Grable's first name, but we only called him Dr Grable.
I doubt Roland even knew his first name was Arthur.
Mrs Stodie, can I get a copy of Roland's file and past history?
- Our patients' histories are confidential.
- l understand, but I can obtain them.
The less time we spend in court, the more time we have to help Roland.
Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable.
He specifically wanted a mentally challenged person.
Are you suggesting Arthur Grable hired Roland in order to use him?
Are you suggesting Arthur Grable is not dead?
If he had intentions of killing Nollette, Keats and Surnow, why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect?
But, by the look of this, he's hamburger.
Maybe he staged it.
That would explain why his work is continuing on, six months after his... death.
This obituary says Arthur Grable was born in Seattle.
His father was a big banker.
His mother was active in a number of charities.
Only child.
Summa cum laude in physics.
Doctoral and postdoctoral in aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd.
Brilliant future tragically cut short.
Roland's also from Seattle.
He spent most of his life at the Heritage Halfway House.
The identity of his parents has been sealed.
There's very little information before the age of three, when he went to the home.
Does it say when he was born?
July 15, 1952.
That's also Arthur's birth date.
Don't you wish you could fly?
I can.
When I dream.
People can do anything in a dream, you know.
Once...
One time I had a dream we were married and lived in a house.
Do you have dreams, Roland?
You can tell me.
Roland?
Who's Arthur?
I'm sorry, Roland!
I'm sorry!
Roland!
Roland!
Go away!
Roland!
What's the matter?
Go away!
I don't want to hurt you!
Go away!
Go away.
- ls that you?
- Yes.
Cool do!
What's the story here?
A quantum physics professor of mine at Harvey Mudd... flunked me.
He challenged a tenet of one of my theories.
A theory I later published in Nature.
Anyway... to get back at him...
One afternoon we decided to take his car apart and put it back together again in his office, and left it running.
- An egghead classic.
- lt was Arthur Grable's idea.
- ls that Arthur Grable sitting on the chair?
- Yeah.
- Was he a practical joker?
- Atop of all his brilliance he had a genius for elaborate schemes.
Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 lQ is gaining access to and... operating his old computer files?
Arthur would still have to be alive.
- Could he have faked his own death?
- No.
The police report on the auto accident was woefully incomplete.
A dry road surface.
No mechanical problems.
The body was never admitted to a county morgue and there was no funeral.
If you are trying to suggest that Arthur Grable killed Surnow and Keats, and is after me next, you're way off.
Art could not have done the murders.
How can you be so certain?
This is Arthur Grable.
Because of massive damage to his body caused by the accident we could only preserve the head.
Wouldn't your client find it inconvenient to be thawed out in the future, only to discover he had no functional mobility?
By the time science figures a way to revive our clients...
- You'll also know how to clone new bodies.
- Exactly!
This technology is progressing faster than anyone thought possible.
Ask anyone here.
While for us the passing of each second brings our bodies closer to death, for our clients it brings them closer to life.
These fluctuations - do they happen often?
We've had some problems with Dr Grable's capsule.
Our technicians checked it and found nothing.
is it possible the brain is causing it?
No.
But we are looking for the explanation.
The patient remains preserved as long as there's liquid nitrogen in the capsule.
May we take a look at Arthur Grable's records?
Thank you.
Dr Barrington, as to future medical science, what requirements will exist to be an organ donor?
Same as today - compatible genetic make-up.
It's best if the donor's related.
Mulder.
Arthur Grable put down only one donor.
Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable have the same birthday.
I think they're twins.
Older or younger?
Same age.
Just less hairy and with better eyesight.
- Gotcha.
And the moustache?
- No, lose the whole beard.
Next?
Close-cropped hair, with a slightly receding widow's peak.
Lose the glasses.
- That's Roland.
- Give or take a few pounds.
Tell me about your dreams, Roland.
It's all right. I won't tell anybody.
You know, I had a dream last night.
I dreamt I was swimming in this pool.
And I could see my father underwater.
But when I dove down, the water stung my eyes.
And there was another man at the pool, watching me.
He upset me.
He was asking me questions I didn't want to answer.
I had to leave.
I couldn't find my father.
I can't tell you my dreams.
Why not?
Bad.
Your dreams are bad, Roland.
Not you.
You're a good person.
I hit Tracy.
Your dreams make you hit Tracy?
You know how to work this toy, Roland?
Here.
You see, the way you work that toy, is like what's happening to you.
You're the spaceship, Roland.
And your dreams are the controls.
Who...
Who runs the controls?
Have you seen this man recently?
Come on, Arthur.
We have to say bye-bye to Roland.
Bye.
Roland...
Roland!
Roland, stop!
Roland!
- Roland!
- We need to keep Roland under observation.
Roland!
- He's trying to get away.
- Roland!
Roland!
Nollette's gone.
We should arrange a security guard to find him.
No one's gonna provide anything once you explain how Roland Fuller is capable of these murders.
You've got a brother, don't you, Scully?
Yeah. I've got an older one and a younger one.
Have you ever thought about calling one of them, and then suddenly they call you?
is this a way for me to lower my long-distance charges?
I believe in psychic connections.
Evidence suggests it's stronger between family members.
Especially twin siblings.
OK...
Maybe.
But in this case, one sibling has closer ties to a frozen fudgsicle than he does to his own brother.
Arthur Grable is not dead.
He's in a state of consciousness no human has returned from.
What if that state allows one to develop psychic ability that the conscious mind is too preoccupied to explore or believe in?
He could use that to control his brother to kill the scientists.
But why?
He's been working with them for years.
That's a question only Dr Nollette can answer.
OK.
Let's go.
I have to call my brother.
We've got to find Nollette.
Let's talk to campus security.
- We go this way?
- No, we go left.
Well, wherever you are, Arthur, I'm sure you'll appreciate this.
Arthur and Roland Grable, born at Puget Presbyterian to Mr and Mrs Lewis Grable on July 15th, 1952.
Arthur was four minutes older than Roland.
identical twins.
Which means that they're the result of a single egg fertilised by a single sperm.
Studies suggest that in some cases the identical twin arises early in the embryonic stage.
A mutation in one cell is rejected by other cells as foreign.
Roland's condition is the result of a damaged chromosome rejected by Arthur's cells?
In a way, that would explain Arthur's genius and Roland's mathematical gift.
In a way.
Agent Scully.
This is Larry Barrington at the Avalon Foundation.
We've got a situation here.
Last night we had a break-in at the facility.
That's right.
It's Arthur Grable's storage unit.
His thermostat's been compromised.
- Was there any tissue damage?
- We're trying to assess that now.
The temperature's still rising.
Something's blocking our access to the cooling program.
Someone tampered with Arthur Grable's capsule.
They're attempting to stabilise it.
Nollette?
What...
What is this?
If I have seen further than other men, it's because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.
No...
This isn't yours.
It's amazing.
There's this body, sitting there in front of me, talking.
But you're controlling it, Arthur.
You... took my work!
What good was your work going to do you?
You died before you could finish it, before you could publish it.
It was mine!
And a brilliant piece of work, too.
When I saw the writing on the board, I knew someone had found the key.
Mach 15 was within our reach.
Our futures were guaranteed.
Ironic, isn't it?
You did all the work, and I get all the glory.
No!
Yes.
Yes, Arthur.
I was here, working on the intake problem, moments away from a solution, when you attacked me.
Fortunately, I was carrying a gun.
After the murder of my colleagues, who could blame me?
That's...
That's interesting.
I've got it!
That's it!
I've got it!
Arthur!
Arthur!
Open the door!
Arthur, how do you stop this?
Tell me how!
- Arthur!
- Hey!
Roland, we need you to help us.
Please, we need you to help us to stop the machine.
Try to remember how.
Roland, you've got to help him or he's going to die.
Wave goodbye, Arthur!
- Come on, Roland.
- l can't remember!
He'll be held in psychiatric custody for evaluation.
- ls he being charged with a crime?
- The DA hasn't made that determination yet.
We've recommended he be remanded to your custody as soon as the court allows it.
How could this happen?
Roland never exhibited any violent tendencies.
It's my belief that he wasn't acting under his own volition.
What do you mean?
This is the work of Arthur, Roland's brother.
It's a new theory of jet propulsion, unfinished.
In the last two weeks, Roland has completed the calculations.
How?
We're not sure.
All we know is that Roland was somehow able to finish his brother's research.
Roland?
Where are you going?
Roland, don't go.
I have to.
OK.
Bye.
Tracy...
Wait.
Keep my stars.
I love you.
Me, too.
Visiontext Subtitles by Sally Lewis
I made this!
english
Eugene?
Eugene, it's Dr Monte.
Eugene, are you asleep?
No.
I was on my way out.
I wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.
Fine.
Good.
You nervous about tomorrow?
Don't be.
I know you think they won't let you out, so I peeked at the reports of the doctors that will testify at your review.
They concur with my opinion that you're ready to be released... and rejoin the community.
So... why don't we get some sleep and relax and I'll see you tomorrow at the review, OK?
Let's just keep our fingers crossed.
Agent Scully, we have reviewed your reports and frankly we are displeased.
Irregular procedure, untenable evidence, anonymous witnesses, inconclusive findings aggravated by vague opinion.
The nature of X-Files cases often precludes orthodox investigation.
Do you suggest we adopt separate standards for you and Mulder?
No.
Does Agent Mulder obstruct you from proper procedure?
No, sir. I'm suggesting these cases be reviewed with an open mind.
Maybe your mind has become too open.
On cases investigated by Mulder and myself to date, we have a conviction or case solution of 75o/o, well above Bureau standard.
That is your only saving grace.
May I ask, sir, what more you require?
What I require is increased frequency of reports, conventional investigation.
In short, Agent Scully, it is your responsibility to see that these cases are by the book.
I understand.
However... conventional investigation of these cases may decrease the rate of success.
By order of the State of Maryland, the court shall review the psychological status of Eugene Victor Tooms.
We'll begin with the court-appointed expert witnesses.
The court calls
Dr Pamela Karetzky.
I performed several diagnostic procedures on Mr Tooms in order to determine any organic physiological dysfunction.
An electroencephalogram, chromosomal analysis, a computerised axial tomograph.
All of these were negative.
"Mr Tooms had recently lost his job
(Baltimore Animal Regulation/Dog-catcher)."
"Aggravated by a false arrest by the fbi, his assault on Agent Scully was 'frustration directed at the wrong person'."
I am reading from a recent interview I did with Mr Tooms at the Druid Hill Sanitarium.
Question:
If you were released, what is the first thing you would do?
Answer:
I'd like my old job back.
Question:
Why?
Answer:
The animal shelter made me feel I was helping everyone, people and animals.
Mr Tooms has learned to articulate his feelings and invest his emotional energy and creative energy in...
..stratagems he can build up in himself.
It is my opinion that Mr Tooms has had an excellent response to the treatment and therapy.
I would see no reason why he would be any danger to himself or any member of society.
Do you swear your testimony is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Mr Mulder, as an expert witness for the State of Maryland, can you list your qualifications?
I'm a special agent with the fbi.
I worked for three years at its behavioural science unit, profiling serial killers.
Your Honour, I know where he's going with this.
Mr Tooms was placed in psychiatric care solely for the assault on Agent Scully.
He has never been charged with any other crime.
You may proceed... with caution.
Agent Mulder, I understand you've drawn on your experience to profile Mr Tooms.
- Yes, I have.
- Please.
These murders span nearly a century.
19 homicides, five occurring every 30 years since 1903.
All in the Baltimore area.
In each case, the liver was extracted and presumably eaten.
A trophy was taken from each victim, many of which were found in the living quarters of Eugene Tooms at 66 Exeter Street.
Records show that a Eugene Tooms has resided at that same address since 1903, the same year a man was murdered in that building.
Besides liver extraction, the most notable link is the undetermined point of entry.
Many victims were found with their windows and doors locked from the inside.
These elongated fingerprints found at 7 of the 19 crime scenes match Tooms.
Agent Mulder, look at his fingers.
- Look at him.
- Perhaps through a genetic mutation,
Eugene Tooms is capable of elongating his body to access victims so he may extract the livers which provide sustenance for the hibernation period of 30 years.
- He needs one more victim.
- Your Honour!
An exam done at the time of his arrest revealed muscle and bone abnormalities.
- His attorney blocked further study.
- Thank you!
- Counsel?
- No further questions, Your Honour.
- This an abnormal human creature.
- Agent Mulder!
You may step down.
If you release Tooms, he will kill again.
It's in his genetic make-up.
Think they'd have taken me more seriously if I wore the grey suit?
Mulder, your testimony, you sounded so... I don't care as long as it was the truth.
Where were you?
- Your testimony was important.
- l was called into a meeting.
- By Assistant Director Skinner.
- What did he want?
He just wanted to reel me in.
They're ready.
It is the opinion of this court that Eugene Victor Tooms shall on this day be released from the Druid Hill Sanitarium.
The court also attaches these conditions.
One, that he remain in counselling under the care of Dr Aaron Monte, that he retain his job at Baltimore Animal Shelter, and last, that he take residence in the house of Mr and Mrs Arlan Green, trained
to assist patients from Druid Hill in their transition to society.
Mr Tooms, do you understand and accept these conditions?
Yes, Your Honour.
Very well.
You're free to go.
- l'm not taking my eyes off him.
- Mulder...
He'll kill the first chance he can, but he won't kill the old couple.
Tooms didn't remain a secret for 100 years by not being careful.
He'll only kill out of necessity or self-defence.
If he makes an attempt, I'll stop him.
I'll keep surveillance with you.
I'll watch him.
Go back to the earlier murders to prove it was him.
- That was 30 or 60 years ago.
- Murder has no statute of limitation.
Mulder, that's going to entail unorthodox methods of investigation.
If you're resistant because you don't believe, I'll respect that.
If it's because of bureaucratic pressure, they've reeled you in and skinned you.
I hope you'll be comfortable, Eugene.
The room in the back is small, but I'm sure you'll be able to squeeze in.
I'm sure.
Excuse me...
could you help me find my dog?
He's a Norwegian elkhound.
His name is Heinrich.
I use him to hunt moose.
If Tooms gets away now, then the next time he takes a life you'll be nearly my age.
Detective Briggs, you helped us so much before.
Now we have to prove that Tooms was involved in the killings you investigated 30 years ago.
You've lived with this case half your life.
There must be something... maybe a connection between the victims.
I know we've seen all the evidence, but is there anything, anything at all amongst the evidence that does not fit?
There was something that never did sit quite right with me.
All of the victims that I investigated in '63 were found at the crime scene, liver extracted - all five.
As were the four most recent murders.
When I was a sheriff during the Powhattan Mill killings of 1933, only four of the victims were found at the crime scene.
However, there was a fifth person who was missing and never found.
But this...
This was discovered at the Ruxton chemical plant when it was under construction.
It doesn't belong to the other victims.
That doesn't prove it belongs to a person murdered by Tooms.
I'm positive Tooms hid this one victim because something about the body could prove he was the killer.
- What makes you positive?
- A hunch.
An old-fashioned hunch.
You've got to trust your instincts.
And... what does your instinct say about where Tooms buried the body?
In the cement where they poured the foundation of the chemical plant.
Ground-penetrating radar.
It bounces signals off objects or cavities.
Tells you where the body is.
Well, it signals if something inordinate is present.
An experienced operator attempts to differentiate if a signal is a body or a stone or a hole in the ground.
Differentiates?
You mean he guesses.
Well, it's an educated guess.
How are we doing?
Well, it's really hard to tell.
There are some possibilities.
Nothing very conclusive... lt's here!
Here!
What is it?
It's here!
Right here!
Agent Scully, look at this.
Robo-toddler's finally sleeping!
I'm gonna watch TV in bed.
OK.
I'm coming, honey.
Oh, screw it!
Would you go down and get that?
fbi.
I suspect an intruder in your house.
What?
Someone opened my window!
I suspect the year of death to be in the mid-1930s.
The anterior surface of the right femur was green, indicating exposure to copper.
We concentrated on the area and we found several pennies.
1933... '31... 1933.
Can you determine cause of death?
My instinct says burial in cement is murder.
No, at the moment I have found no definite proof of murder.
There are gnawing marks near the ribs.
I suspect that's rodent activity prior to the body being set in cement.
We need to see more of the remains for cause of death.
As you know, it's a slow but necessary process.
I did try a little something.
It's a little premature if we're gonna go by the book.
Well, we'll keep it off the record.
Good.
Thank you.
The old man, Mr Briggs, gave me a photograph of the missing person in 1933 suspected of being a murder victim.
I ran a computer-aided superimposition on what we have of the skull.
Now... this is not official, but that skeleton was that person.
It's not enough. lt doesn't tie it to Tooms.
Well, it's a start.
Mulder, it's getting a bit ripe in here, don't you think?
Pine-scented!
Better?
Tooms hasn't come out of the house all day.
I've sat through a Phillies game and four hours of Baba Booey.
When it got dark, I took a walk.
Got that sandwich I asked for?
It's liverwurst.
You know proper surveillance requires two pairs of agents, one pair relieving the other after 12 hours.
Article 30, paragraph 8.7?
This isn't about doing it by the book.
You haven't slept for three days.
You're gonna get sloppy and you're gonna get hurt. lt's inevitable.
A request for other agents to stake out Tooms would be denied.
Then I'll stay, you go home.
They're out to put an end to the X-Files, Scully.
I don't know why, but any excuse will do.
I don't really care about my record, but you'd be in trouble just sitting in this car.
I'd hate to see you carry an official reprimand in your file because of me.
Fox... I...
I... even made my parents call me Mulder.
Mulder.
Mulder, I wouldn't put myself on the line for anybody but you.
If there's an iced tea in that bag, it could be love.
Must be fate, Mulder.
Root beer.
You're delirious.
Go home and get some sleep.
Take my sandwich. I only had one bite.
You're gonna want it later.
Call me if anything happens.
lmmediately. I'll be here.
Oh, oh, and 11.30, station 790,
Pete Rose's late-night sports talk radio show.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
It has worked, hasn't it?
You'll be all right now.
I know it's worked!
Yeah, they found him out cold in the street.
He's been beaten up pretty badly.
Contusions, multiple lacerations.
The shoulder's been pulled right out ofjoint.
Let's get him prepped for some blood work and X-rays.
He's been kicked in the jaw.
It may be fractured.
There's a partial shoe print.
I wanna get a photo of that.
We might be able to find the shoe that matches it later.
Do you know who did this to you?
We'll be right back, Mr Tooms.
Says it was an fbi agent named Mulder.
So would you say he's delusional or just schizophrenic?
It's just a cursory exam, but there's nothing to indicate that.
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.
What's going on?
What's this about?
Agent Mulder, get your things.
You're in some trouble.
These are serious allegations.
The evidence is incriminating.
A good forensic scientist would know there is not only a shoe print but an impact point of the foot from inside the shoe.
An analysis of Tooms's injury would show my foot was not inside the shoe.
Are you suggesting Tooms is framing you?
- Of course.
- lf you had him under surveillance, how could he gain access to your shoe without you seeing him?
- Well...
- Sir.
I was engaged in the unauthorised surveillance as well.
Agent Mulder was orienting me on the situation at the time Tooms was admitted into the hospital.
Agent Mulder could not have done it because he was with me.
Agent Scully, you wouldn't be lying to me, would you?
Sir, I would expect you to place the same trust in me as I do in you.
Agent Scully, may I have a word with Agent Mulder, please?
Fox,... you were one of the finest, most unique agents in the nearly 60-year history of this institution.
We were talking about you when you were in the academy.
Most of us, including the director, feel you are wasted on the X-Files.
But we respect that you are deeply invested in those areas.
But if these cases are creating such stress as to cause not only you to act inappropriately but agents close to you, then may I advise you to step away for a while?
Clear your head, take an extended vacation.
That's a good idea.
Thanks for your concern.
You're forbidden to go near Eugene Tooms.
Mulder,... this was close.
Any closer and 1,000 friends at the Capitol won't be able to help you.
These are Eugene Tooms's dental X-rays obtained from the Druid Hill Sanitarium.
Your sandwich the other night gave me an idea.
Dr Plith had mentioned that he found gnawing on the rib cage near the location of the liver.
Further excavation revealed more pronounced bite marks, human teeth marks.
Tooms will never voluntarily submit to a dental cast.
This software can create a three-dimensional model of Tooms's mouth from the dental radiograph.
We've also mapped out the bite marks from the skeleton's rib - here.
They match.
Eugene, Dr Monte.
Hi, I wanted to stop by and see how everything was going.
Susan and I are going out for the evening.
- See you later.
- Thanks.
Great place.
Wonderful place.
How are you feeling?
Why the newspaper strips, Eugene?
Are you making some papier-mâché?
Yes.
That's terrific, wonderful.
I had no idea you were interested in art.
I like art.
I do, too. I'm very proud of you.
Art can provide a window to your thoughts and your feelings.
What are you doing, Eugene?
Eugene... are you all right?
That makes five.
He's building his nest.
- 30-year hibernation.
- Where would he go?
Where he's gone for the last 90 years - 66 Exeter Street.
No, I already checked.
They tore down that apartment building.
What's there now?
Thanks.
He's gotta be here.
If he's drawn to this location for some reason, maybe this nest is in the approximate location of the previous nest.
This is the area.
There's a storage facility on the second floor.
What?
There's only room for one.
You can get the next mutant.
Mulder?
Mulder?
Mulder!
Mulder, here!
Quick, grab my hand!
Come on!
Mulder, what's happening?
Quick!
Have you read this report?
Do you believe them?
Of course I do.
OK, let's go.
It's amazing how things change, isn't it?
The caterpillar?
No, a change for us.
- lt's coming.
- How do you know?
A hunch.
Visiontext Subtitles by Pam Atkinson
I made this!
english
They put the time of death between eight and twelve hours ago.
No visible cause, no sign of battery or sexual assault.
All we have is this.
Can we turn her over?
Karen Swenson.
- ls that a positive id?
- She went to school with my son.
Would that be the class of '89?
It's happening again, isn't it?
Agent Dana Scully.
Come in.
Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice.
Please.
- You've been with us just over two years.
- Yes, sir.
You went to medical school but you chose not to practise.
How'd you come to work for the fbi?
Well, sir, I was recruited out of medical school.
My parents still think it was an act of rebellion.
But I saw the fbi as a place where l could distinguish myself.
Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder?
Yes, I am.
- How so?
- By reputation.
He's an Oxford-educated psychologist who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988.
Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crime section.
He had a nickname at the Academy.
Spooky Mulder.
Agent Mulder has developed a consuming devotion to an unassigned project outside the Bureau mainstream.
Are you familiar with the so-called X-Files?
I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena.
More or less.
The reason you're here is we want you to assist Mulder on these X-Files.
You'll write field reports on your activities and your observations on the validity of the work.
Am I to understand that you want me to debunk the X-Files project, sir?
We trust you'll make the proper scientific analysis.
You'll want to contact Agent Mulder.
We look forward to your reports.
Sorry, nobody down here but the fbi's Most Unwanted.
Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully.
I've been assigned to work with you.
Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded!
Who did you tick off to get stuck with this?
Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard a lot about you.
Oh, really?
I was under the impression that you were sent to spy on me.
If you have any doubt about my qualifications or credentials...
You're a medical doctor.
You teach at the Academy.
You did your undergraduate degree in physics.
"Einstein's Twin Paradox:
A New Interpretation.
Dana Scully."
That's a credential, rewriting Einstein.
- Did you bother to read it?
- l did. I liked it.
It's just that in most of my work, the laws of physics rarely seem to apply.
Maybe I can get your medical opinion on this though.
Oregon female, age 21, no explainable cause of death.
Autopsy shows nothing.
Zip.
There are, however, these two distinct marks on her lower back.
Dr Scully, can you lD these marks?
Needle punctures, maybe.
An animal bite.
Electrocution of some kind.
How's your chemistry?
This substance was found in the surrounding tissue.
It's organic.
I don't know.
is it some kind of synthetic protein?
I've never seen it before either.
But here it is again in Sturgis, South Dakota.
And again in Shamrock, Texas.
- Do you have a theory?
- l have plenty of theories.
Maybe what you could explain to me is why it's Bureau policy to label these cases as unexplained phenomena and ignore them.
Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?
Logically, I would have to say no.
Given the distances needed to travel from deep space, the energy requirements would exceed...
Conventional wisdom.
This Oregon female is the 4th person in her graduating class to die under mysterious circumstances.
Now when convention and science offer us no answers, might we not finally turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?
The girl obviously died of something.
If it was natural causes, maybe something was missed in the postmortem.
If she was murdered, it's plausible there was a sloppy investigation.
What I find fantastic is any notion that there are answers beyond the realm of science.
The answers are there.
You just have to know where to look.
That's why they put the "l" in fbi.
See you tomorrow morning, Scully.
Bright and early.
We leave for the very plausible state of Oregon at 8am.
Would all passengers fasten their seat belts as we're about to make...
This must be the place.
You didn't mention yesterday this case has already been investigated.
The fbi got involved after the first three deaths when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence.
Our boys came out here, enjoyed the local salmon, which, with a little lemon twist, is just to die for.
Without explanation they were called back in, the case was reclassified and buried in the X-Files until I dug it up.
And you found something they didn't?
The autopsy reports of the first three victims show no unidentified marks.
But those reports were signed by a different medical examiner than the latest victim.
That's good, Scully.
Better than you expected or better than you hoped?
I'll let you know when we get past the easy part.
is the medical examiner a suspect?
We don't know yet. I've arranged to exhume one of the other victims' bodies to see if we can get a tissue sample to match the girl's.
- You're not squeamish, are you?
- l don't know. I've never had the pleasure.
What's going on?
- What the hell was that about?
- Oh, you know.
Probably nothing.
Mr Mulder, John Truitt, County Coroner's Office.
Yeah, hi.
This is Agent Scully.
How soon can we get started?
- We're ready to go.
- Oh, great!
Were you able to arrange for an examination facility?
- We got something for ya.
- Excuse me!
Excuse me.
No.
Please!
Please stay in the car!
I just don't know who you people think you are.
You think you can come up here and do whatever you please!
I'm sorry.
You are...?
I'm Dr Jay Nemman, County Medical Examiner.
Surely you were told of our intentions?
No.
No, we've been away.
Oh!
Well, that answers a question that we had.
Why you hadn't done the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson.
You're aware of the tissue sample taken from her?
What is the insinuation here?
That I missed something in those other kids?
- We're not insinuating anything, sir.
- Wait a minute!
See, I think you are!
And you'd better have something to back it up.
Daddy, please!
Let's just go home.
Let's go home!
Please!
The guy obviously needed a longer vacation.
Ray Soames was the third victim.
He spent time in a state mental hospital, treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.
Soames confessed to the first two murders but couldn't produce any evidence that he committed the crimes.
Did you read the cause of death?
Exposure.
His body was found in the woods after escaping the hospital.
Missing for only seven hours in July.
How does a 20-year-old boy die of exposure on a warm, summer night in Oregon, Dr Scully?
I got it.
- This isn't official procedure.
- Really?
It's probably a safe bet Ray Soames never made the varsity basketball team.
Seal this up now!
Nobody sees or touches this.
Nobody!
This is amazing!
Do you know what this could mean?
It's almost too big to comprehend.
The subject is 156cms in length, weighing 52lbs in extremis.
Corpse is in advanced stages of decay and desiccation.
Distinguishing features include large ocular cavities.
Oblate cranium indicates subject is not human.
Could you point that flash away from me, please?
If it's not human, what is it?
It's familian.
A chimpanzee or something from the ape family.
Possibly an orang-utan.
Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soames's grave.
Try telling that to Ray Soames's family!
I want tissue samples, X-rays, blood typing, toxicology and a full genetic work-up.
- You're serious?
- What we can't do here, we'll order to go.
You don't honestly believe this is some kind of an extraterrestrial?
- This is somebody's sickjoke.
- We can do those X-rays here?
Can't we do them right now?
I'm not crazy, Scully.
I have the same doubts you do.
Visual inspection of the body and X-ray analysis confirms homologous but possibly mutated mammalian physiology.
However, does not account for small unidentified object found in subject's nasal cavity.
A grey metallic implant...
Who is it?
Steven Spielberg!
I'm going for a run.
You wanna come?
Pass.
You figure out what was up Ray Soames's nose yet?
No.
And I'm not losing sleep over it.
Good night.
Ray Soames was a patient of mine, yes.
I oversaw his treatment for a year for clinical schizophrenia.
He couldn't grasp reality.
He suffered from some kind of post-traumatic stress.
- Have you seen it before?
- l've treated similar cases.
Were any of those Ray Soames's classmates?
Yes.
We're trying to find a connection in these deaths.
Did you treat any of these kids with hypnosis?
No, I did not.
- Are you treating any of these kids now?
- Currently?
Yes, I'm treating Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell.
Both long-term live-in patients.
- They're here at this hospital?
- That's right.
Going on four years now.
Can we talk to them?
Well, you might find it difficult, certainly in Billy Miles' case.
Billy's experiencing a waking coma.
His brain waves are flat and he's persistent vegetative.
How did it happen?
He and Peggy were involved in an automobile accident on State Road.
Peggy?
We have some visitors.
Would you like to talk with them?
Billy wants me to read now.
- Does he like it when you read to him?
- Yes.
Billy needs me close.
Doctor?
I'm wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam on Peggy.
Peggy, what are you doing?
No one is going to hurt you!
Get an orderly!
Nobody's going to hurt you.
The nurse is here.
It's all right. lt's all right.
Peggy, you're going to be fine.
You've had these nosebleeds before.
Now calm down.
Whatshisname...
Billy said he was sorry he didn't get to say goodbye.
How did you know she'd have the marks?
I don't know.
Lucky guess?
Dammit, Mulder, cut the crap.
What do you know about those marks?
What are they?
Why?
So you can put it in your report?
You're not ready for what I think.
I'm here to solve this case. I want the truth.
The truth?
I think those kids have been abducted.
By who?
By what?
- You don't really believe that?
- Do you have a better explanation?
I'll buy that girl is suffering some kind of pronounced psychosis.
Whether it's organic or the result of those marks, I can't say.
But to say that they've been riding around in flying saucers is crazy!
- There is nothing to support that.
- Nothing scientific.
There has got to be an explanation.
You've got four victims.
All of them died in or near the woods.
They found Karen Swenson's body in the forest in her pyjamas ten miles from her house.
How did she get there?
What were those kids doing out there in the forest?
Mulder?
Mulder, is that you?
Mulder?
Special Agent Dana Scully, fbi.
Drop your weapon.
I'm with the County Sheriff's Department.
- You're trespassing on private property here.
- We are conducting an investigation.
Get in your car and leave!
Or I'll have to arrest you.
I don't care who you are.
Hold on!
This is a crime scene.
Did you hear what I said?
You are on private property without legal permission.
Now I'm only gonna say it one more time - get in your car and leave!
What's he doing out here all by himself?
Maybe it has something to do with this.
What do you think it is?
I don't know.
- ls it a campfire?
- lt was all over the ground.
I think something's going on out here.
Some kind of a sacrifice, maybe.
What if these kids are involved in some kind of a cult and that man knows something about it?
I wanna come back here.
You OK, Mulder?
- Yeah, I'm just...
- What are you looking for?
- What happened?
- We lost power.
Brakes, steering, everything.
We lost nine minutes!
We lost what?
Nine minutes!
I looked at my watch just before the flash, it was 9:03 - itjust turned 9:13.
Look!
Look!
Oh, yes!
Abductees!
People that have sighted UFOs reported unexplained time loss.
- Come on!
- Gone!
Just like that!
No, wait a minute.
You're saying that time disappeared?
Time can'tjust disappear!
It's a universal invariance!
Not in this zip code.
Great!
Hi!
- l want you to look at something.
- Come on in.
What are they?
Mulder, what are they?
Mosquito bites.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I got eaten up alive myself out there.
You OK?
Yes.
- You're shaking.
- l need to sit down.
Take your time.
I was 12 when it happened.
My sister was eight.
She just disappeared out of her bed one night.
Just gone.
Vanished.
No note.
No phone calls.
No evidence of anything.
You never found her?
It tore the family apart.
No one would talk about it.
There were no facts to confront.
Nothing to offer any hope.
What did you do?
I went off to school in England.
I came back, got recruited by the Bureau.
It seems I had a natural aptitude for applying behavioural models to criminal cases.
My success allowed me a certain freedom to pursue my own interests.
And that's when I came across the X-Files.
By accident?
At first it looked like a garbage dump for UFO sightings, alien abduction reports, the kind of stuff most people laugh at.
But I was fascinated. I read all the cases I could get my hands on.
I read everything about paranormal phenomena, about the occult and...
What?
There's classified government information I've been trying to access but someone has been blocking me.
- Who?
I don't understand.
- Someone at a higher level of power.
I'm allowed to continue my work because I've made connections in Congress.
And they're afraid you'll leak this information?
You're part of that agenda.
You know that.
I'm not a part of any agenda.
You've got to trust me.
I'm here just like you, to solve this.
I'm telling you this, Scully, because you need to know.
Because of what you've seen.
In my research I've worked very closely with a man named Dr Heitz Werber.
He's taken me through deep-regression hypnosis.
I've been able to go into my own repressed memories to the night my sister disappeared.
I can recall a bright light outside and a presence in the room.
I was paralysed, unable to respond to my sister's calls for help.
Listen to me, Scully!
This thing exists.
- But how do you know...
- The government knows about it.
And I gotta know what they're protecting.
Nothing else matters to me.
And this is as close as I've ever gotten to it.
Hello?
What?
!
Who is this?
Who is th...
That was some woman who just said Peggy O'Dell was dead.
The girl in the wheelchair?
- What happened?
- She ran out in front of me.
- Who are you?
- She was running?
On foot?
- That's just...
Let's go!
- We need to ask a few questions.
Someone trashed the lab and they stole the body.
- We're going back to the motel.
- What?
They stole the corpse?
fbi.
There goes my computer!
Dammit!
The X-rays and pictures!
My name is Teresa Nemman.
You've got to protect me!
Come with us.
This is the way it happens.
I don't know how I get out there.
I'll just find myself out in the woods.
- How long has it been happening?
- Ever since the summer we graduated.
It's happened to my friends, too.
That's why I need you to protect me.
I'm scared I might... die, like the others.
Like...
Peggy did tonight.
Your father's the medical examiner.
You were the one on the phone.
You told me Peggy O'Dell had been killed.
Teresa, your father knows about this, doesn't he?
About what happens?
Yes.
But he said never to tell anyone about any of it.
- Why?
- He wants to protect me.
He thinks he can protect me.
But I don't think he can.
Do you have the marks, Teresa?
Yes.
I'm going to die, aren't I?
I'm gonna be next!
No, you're not going to die.
Oh, God!
Let's go home, Teresa.
Teresa, come on.
Come on, honey.
- l don't think she wants to leave.
- l don't care what you think!
She's sick.
Your father wants to take you home.
He'll clean you up.
I'll take you where you'll be safe.
Detective Miles and I won't let anything happen to you.
You're Billy Miles's father?
That's right.
And you stay away from that boy.
Ah, you gotta love this place.
Every day is like Halloween.
They know, Mulder.
They know who's responsible for the murders.
They know something.
Dr Nemman's been hiding medical evidence from the beginning.
He lied on the autopsy.
And now we find out about the detective.
Who else would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms?
Why would they destroy evidence?
What would they want with that corpse?
I don't know.
Makes you wonder what's in those other two graves.
- They're both empty.
- What is going on here?
I think I know who did it.
I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.
Who?
The detective?
The detective's son.
Billy Miles.
The boy in the hospital?
The vegetable?
Billy Miles?
A boy who's been in a coma for four years came here and dug up these graves?
Peggy O'Dell was in a wheelchair but she ran in front of a truck.
Look, it all fits a profile of alien abduction.
This fits a profile?
Peggy O'Dell was killed around nine.
The same time we lost nine minutes.
Something happened then.
I think that time, as we know it, stopped.
And something took control over it.
You think I'm crazy.
What?
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped a couple of minutes after nine.
I made a note of it when I saw the body.
That's why the kids come to the forest.
It controls them. lt summons them.
And the marks are from some kind of tests being done on them.
And that maybe causes some kind of genetic mutation, which explains the body we dug up.
And the force summoned Teresa Nemman's body into the woods tonight.
Yes!
But Billy Miles took her there.
Summoned by some alien impulse.
That's it!
Come on, let's get out of here.
- Where are we going?
- We're gonna visit Billy Miles.
We could be here until the Second Coming waiting for Billy to get out of this bed.
It ain't gonna happen.
He blinks and I know about it.
- l guess you changed his bedpan last night.
- Nobody else here's gonna do it.
You noticed nothing unusual?
Do you remember what you were doing last night around nine o'clock?
Probably... watching TV.
Yeah.
Do you remember what you were watching?
Let's see.
I don't really remember what I watched.
Miss?
What is she looking for?
Mulder, take a look at this.
- Who took care of Peggy last night?
- Not me. lt's not my ward.
Not my aisle of the produce section.
I do have ajob of my own to do.
What is she doing now?
Thank you for your time.
- OK.
- Good day.
That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell!
- Scully...
- lt's crazy!
- He was in the woods!
- You're sure?
This is the same stuff I took a handful of in the forest.
- We should run a test on it.
- We lost the original sample in the fire.
I want you to understand what it is you're saying.
- You said it yourself.
- You have to write it in your report.
You're right.
We'll take another sample from the forest and run a comparison before we do anything.
The detective's here.
What do you think?
You wouldn't listen to me.
I told you to stay out of this.
Hold it!
Hold it right there!
You got no business out here.
- There were screams.
- Down on the ground.
Now!
You know it's Billy.
You've known it all along.
- l said down on the ground.
- How long are you gonna let it happen?
He's gonna kill her!
Billy, no!
Let her go!
Leave her alone!
Dad?
Billy...
Oh, God!
Scully!
- Scully!
- Mulder, what happened?
There was a light... lt was incredible.
If you can hear me, raise your right hand.
Tell me about the light, Billy.
When did you first see the light?
In the forest.
We were all in the forest having a party.
All my friends.
We were celebrating.
- What were you celebrating?
- Graduation.
And then the light came.
It took me away... to the testing place.
They would tell me to gather the others so that they could do tests.
They put something in my head.
Here.
I would wait for their orders.
Billy, who gave the orders?
The light.
They said it would be OK.
No one would know.
But the tests didn't work.
They wanted everything destroyed.
They said they were leaving.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid they're coming back.
Don't be afraid, Billy.
We're here to help you.
What we've just witnessed, what we've read in your field reports, the scientific basis and credibility just seem wholly unsupportable.
- You're aware of that?
- Yes, sir.
My reports are personal and subjective.
I haven't drawn any conclusion about what I've seen.
Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case.
This... time loss.
You did or did not experience it?
I can't substantiate it.
No.
What exactly can you substantiate, Agent Scully?
I see no evidence thatjustifies the legitimacy of these investigations.
There were, of course, crimes committed.
Yes, but how do you prosecute a case like this?
With testimony given under hypnosis from a boy who claims he was given orders from an alien force through an implant in his nose.
You have no physical evidence.
This is the object described by Billy Miles as a communication device.
I removed it from the exhumed body.
I kept it in my pocket. lt was the only piece of evidence not destroyed in the fire.
I ran a lab test on it.
The material could not be identified.
Agent Mulder.
What are his thoughts?
Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.
Thank you, Agent Scully.
That'll be all.
Hello?
Scully, it's me. I haven't been able to sleep.
I talked to the DA's office in Raymon County, Oregon.
There's no case file on Billy Miles.
The paperwork we filed is gone.
We need to talk, Scully.
Yes... tomorrow.

I'm here in Pasadena with the NASA Mission Control team as they celebrate scientific history.
The first close-up photographs of Mars from the Viking Observer spacecraft.
Photos that have created a stir by revealing surprising geologic information.
The presence of large amounts of water locked in Mars' polar ice caps.
Water that some speculate could have possibly sustained life on the planet.
Even more controversial is one image of a land formation.
A formation that looks like a sculpted human face.
However, NASA officials are denying it is an indication of an alien civilisation.
It's no more than a trick of light and shadows.
A geologic anomaly.
The only sculptors at work are the solar winds that blow across the surface of Mars at 300mph, ten months a year.
I'm seeing...
I've got...
How's it going out there?
- There's something out here!

What did the note say?
That they worked for NASA and wanted to talk to somebody from the fbi.
- Why the cloak-and-dagger routine?
- l have no idea.
- Think it's a crank?
- lt's beginning to look that way.
- My name is Michelle Generoo.
- Fox Mulder.
I sent you the note.
Hi.
Special Agent Dana Scully.
I'm sorry to have to take these precautions.
I flew up from Houston this morning.
- l work at the Space Center there.
- ln what capacity?
I'm the Mission Control communications commander for the Shuttle Space Program.
What brings you to Washington?
I have reason to believe a saboteur may be at work inside NASA.
- You have evidence of sabotage?
- l don't know. I may.
Two weeks ago, a shuttle mission was scrubbed three seconds before liftoff when an auxiliary power unit valve malfunctioned.
If the flight had not been aborted, the orbiter would have exploded on the launch pad.
This was sent to me in the mail.
It's a material analysis that shows deep, grooved scoring marks inside this APU valve.
Marks that could have caused a malfunction.
- Evidence of tampering?
- That's what it looks like but...
The person who gave me your names said you are experts in unexplained phenomena.
It's unexplainable how and when anybody could've done it.
- How do you mean?
- The valve is made of ferrocarbon titanium.
To score it would take extreme temperatures.
Launch pad temperatures.
Anyone at NASA would say it would be impossible for anyone to do that type of damage undetected.
- Any idea who may have sent that to you?
- No.
No idea.
But the official analysis of the malfunction was simple mechanical failure.
- Does anybody share your suspicions?
- lf they do, they're not talking to the fbi.
I believe in the Space Program.
I believe in the people who run it.
But there's another launch window tomorrow.
And my reasons may sound selfish, but my fiancé is the shuttle commander on that mission.
Why would somebody sabotage the space shuttle?
If you're a terrorist, it's a potent symbol of American progress and prosperity.
If you're an opponent of big science, NASA represents a vast money trench that exists outside the crucible of the democratic process.
Then there are futurists who think the shuttle is a rusty old bucket that we should mothball.
A dinosaur spacecraft built in the '70s by scientists setting their sights on space.
And we thought we'd rest easy when the Soviet Union fell.
Not to mention fringe elements who accuse our government itself of space sabotage.
The failure of the Hubble telescope and the Mars Observer connected
- to a conspiracy to deny us evidence.
- Evidence of what?
Alien civilisations.
Oh, of course!
- Wow, look at that!
Gemini Eight.
- What?
The man we're gonna see, Colonel Marcus Aurelius Belt, nearly died on that mission.
Made an emergency landing in the Pacific Ocean.
- You remember all that stuff?
- You never wanted to be an astronaut?
I guess I missed that phase.
Come in.
Colonel Belt, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.
- And this is...
- Colonel Belt.
Fox Mulder.
I'm a big fan. lt's an honour to meet you.
- You were a big hero to me when I was a kid.
- Thank you.
I...
I stayed up all night when I was 14 to watch your space walk.
Well, now it's like a stroll around the block.
So, how can I help you?
This found its way to the fbi.
Do you recognise it?
Sure. it's an auxiliary power unit valve.
Do you have any reason to believe it was damaged in an effort to sabotage the Space Program?
No.
- Do you have reason to suspect it at all?
- No reason whatsoever.
If you have any respect for this program and for those who have devoted their lives to it, you'll be careful to whom you make those accusations.
Looking at this evidence, sir, would you consider postponing the shuttle flight until a full investigation could be conducted?
I don't know where you got this specious artefact, but every precaution has been taken to rectify the problem.
We've waited two weeks for a window to initiate this mission.
We've got a payload to deliver.
Has an internal investigation been done in this matter?
The part you have here has been installed, inspected and designed by over 100 highly trained technicians.
With the security measures we take, it would be virtually impossible for one man working by himself, or two or four men, to do what you're suggesting.
I can assure you, there's no one in this facility that doesn't want to see that shuttle complete its mission, and come back like Winged Victory herself.
And in about ten hours, God willing, you're gonna see just that.
Do you think there'd be a problem with us watching liftoff from Mission Control?
Well, being that you'd probably go over my head anyway, please, be my guests.
It was an honour, sir.
Thank you.
Didn't you wanna get his autograph?
Where did you say you got this?
It came to us anonymously.
This is an APU valve, all right.
But this doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?
- This scoring here.
This valve was made of ferrocarbon titanium.
- You didn't order the analysis?
- No. I've never seen this before.
We're on outside contract to NASA.
They may have ordered it.
But wouldn't you order a material analysis if a part malfunctioned?
Every shuttle flies with that same APU valve.
To do an analysis and redesign would delay the Program for months.
Not to mention the cost.
is it conceivable that the Program is being pushed ahead without proper safety precaution?
There are about 17,000 things that can go wrong with the shuttle.
And about 17,000 people who make sure they don't.
Who makes the final determination as to its safety?
We make a recommendation but the decision is Colonel Belt's.
Thank you.
What do you think?
I can't believe how much faith we put in machines.
Do you think Colonel Belt lied about his knowledge of a saboteur?
I can't believe Colonel Belt would endanger the lives of those astronauts.
He was an astronaut himself.
So you think this X-ray is bogus?
God, I hope so.

I have to admit I've fulfilled one of my boyhood fantasies.
Yeah, it ranks up there with learning how to braid my own hair.
Come on, Scully, you have to admit that was exciting.
- Mission Control, the countdown...
- Mulder!
Wait!
- Something's gone wrong.
- What happened?
Something's wrong with the shuttle.
We had trouble with the rocket boosters, but fixed it.
We changed watch. I went home to try to get some sleep.
I got a call.
Communication with the shuttle is down.
We've got to get back to Houston.
There's a press blackout.
Chances are the media doesn't know about it.
- You think this is sabotage?
- l don't know.
Things go wrong all the time.
- Yeah, but they usually fix them, right?
- Usually.
She's turning.
Michelle!
- l can see her.
- Michelle!
- Help!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm stuck!
- Can you move?
Just get me out of here!
I'm wedged in!
- Are you all right?
- l'm wedged in!
Come here.
Can you push with your legs?
- Be careful.
- Just get me out of here!
OK!
All right!
Come on.
Don't try to move.
I've got to get back to Houston.
- What happened?
- l don't know.
Something came at me in the fog.
The next thing I knew, I was upside down.
- Was it some kind of an animal?
- No.
It had a face. lt was... lt was grotesque.
I don't know what it was.
Orbiter, this is Houston.
Do you copy?
Your transmission is breaking up.
What's happening?
We have a malf in the OMS and RCF systems.
They can't get the orbiter into attitude rotation.
Temperature in the cabin is 103 and they have transmission problems.
- What happened?
- l had an accident.
What's their position?
- Just over Eastern Africa.
- Try the Seychelles tracking station.
Hang in there, OTC.
The orbiter manoeuvring system is down.
They can't rotate the shuttle to keep it away from the sun and keep the orbiter cool.
Drop in cabin pressure.
21 kilopascals and declining.
They're gonna burn up.
- Where's Colonel Belt?
- On his way.
- Damn!
What happened to backup?
- Failed to respond.
What about telemetry?
Can we auto-activate from here?
We cannot auto-activate.
It's like someone's interfering.
- Screwing communications from this end.
- Can you trace it?
- lt'd have to be a digital processor.
- They'd have to be in the data banks.
- Where's that?
- Come on.
Mulder?
I'm a federal agent!
Come on out of there!
- What are you doing in here?
- l work here.
- Let me see your clearance.
- A sensor went off.
There was a malfunction.
- Did you find it?
- No.
Did you see anybody else in here?
OK, call Security.
I want a search of the premises.
No one is to come in or out of this building without proper clearance.
- l'm breaking up, OTC.
- What's the attitude of the orbiter?
Flying tail first, belly towards the sun.
The flash evaporator system is working but not enough to cool 'em down.
- Cabin temperature 116.
- Where's...
Somebody's jamming our transmissions.
interfering with our ground communications and scrambling our uplink telemetry.
The shuttle is not responding to override signals.
I'm gonna let 'em fly by wire.
- l'm cutting off telemetry.
- lt might not work.
- We have to give it a chance.
- We have to bring them down.
We have to give them control of the ship to perform that rotation and deliver the payload.
What if they can't?
We could be stranding them.
Abandon telemetry.
Go to fly-by-wire mode.
They're cutting off ground control.
The astronauts will be flying the shuttle.
is it gonna work?
OTC, this is Houston.
How's the weather up there?
Sunny and warm, Houston.
What's the forecast?
OTC, we're going to fly-by-wire mode.
We're going to abort ground control to see if you can bring those systems back up.
Roger that, Houston.
And leave the driving to us.
David...
You take care.
What just happened?
They cut off contact with the shuttle.
Negative.
We pulled off the MPG.
We're on manual.
45 seconds.
If they were able to execute, they'd have done it by now.
Standing by.
60 seconds.
Go to re-establish uplink communication.
Video signal's failed.
OTC, this is Houston.
Do you copy?
OTC, this is Houston.
Where are you?
Howdy do, Houston?
Looks like we finally got this bird to fly right.
- OTC, do you hear that?
- Music to our ears.
Cabin temperature stabilising.
OTC, this is Marc Belt in Houston.
How's the crew holding up?
They're looking good, sir.
You all get some rest.
We'll get back to work
- at about 0700.
- Roger that, Houston.
Let's get to work on that telemetry problem.
We've got a big day ahead of us.
Let's just let the electronic press get their sound equipment set.
I know you have a lot of questions.
I'll get to them.
How did he know what he did was going to work?
He didn't.
They could have died up there and there's nothing we could have done.
They'd have been a ghost ship stuck in orbit.
Why would he take that risk?
Bring those men back without delivering that payload?
You're talking millions of wasted dollars.
That's all Congress would need to shut down NASA.
As of 2200 hours the crew has been conducting on-board tests and tasks and resting up for their first full day in space tomorrow.
I'm happy to say, after a beautiful night launch, the shuttle orbiter has performed... magnificently.
So much for your boyhood hero.
Colonel Belt?
Colonel Belt?
Can I talk to you for a moment?
You want to know why I lied to them.
You're asking yourself if I'd lie to you.
You know what it means to be an astronaut, sir?
You risk your life every time you get into your spacecraft.
For nothing more than the good progress of mankind.
You've got no argument from me, sir.
- You're true American heroes.
- Heroes?
We used to make headlines when we did ourjob right.
Now they bury you in the back of the paper.
Name two astronauts in the last shuttle mission.
You make the front page today only if you screw up.
They only know your name if you're the unlucky s.o.b. sitting on 500 tons of dynamite.
That's what they're really waiting for.
Sir, I have to ask.
I'm sorry. lt's my job.
Do you think someone is sabotaging the shuttle?
My answer to you, sir, will be to bring those men back safely to Earth.
- l've got...
- How's it going out there?
- There's something out here!
- Can you repeat that, Commander Belt?
It's coming at me!
Holy God!
Houston, we just heard something weird.
OTC, Houston.
Can you describe it?
Sort of a dull thump like...
something bumped the ship!
Have you got any ideas about that?
There it is again!
We're taking a look at it now.
That one right there.
They've got an oxygen leak on board the orbiter.
Our O2 gauges are going all screwy, Houston.
We got problems.
An O2 leak in the main tank.
What did they say happened?
- They don't know.
They said it was a thump.
- Stand by.
An astronomer in Winnipeg just spotted a mile-long gaseous cloud trailing in our orbit.
The liquid O2 leaking out into space.
Exactly what happened to Colonel Belt on an Apollo mission.
How much time do they have?
Hard to say without accurate telemetry data.
We're doing a guesstimate.
- Where is Colonel Belt?
- He was due 90 minutes ago to begin payload deployment.
Uh, Houston, we're up here wondering
- when do we start holding our breath?
- We're working on it, OTC.
I need those calculations and a worst-case scenario.
We don't know if both O2 tanks are damaged.
Worst-case scenario!
- And someone find Colonel Belt!
- We'll find him.
They've got 30 minutes of oxygen.
Then it's anybody's guess.
Why does she need Belt?
She doesn't know how serious the leak is.
Even I can figure out what happens when you run out of oxygen.
Colonel Belt's been in the same situation.
He'll know what to do.
Where the hell is he?
Colonel Belt!
Colonel Belt!
I'm gonna go get Security.
Colonel Belt.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I wasn't feeling well.
They need you at Mission Control.
There's been another accident.
OTC, is your orbital manoeuvring system still operational?
Roger, Houston.
We're ready for re-entry.
Just say the word.
How bad's the leak?
We have no way to determine.
OTC.
What's the condensation in your cabin?
The windows are getting steamy.
Carbon dioxide build-up.
OK, OTC.
Everything's gonna be fine.
I want you to get in your spacesuits and depressurise your cabin.
And then I want you to... vent that CO2.
- Roger, Houston.
Then what?
- l want you to stay in your suits.
And then I want you to prepare to use your emergency oxygen systems.
And then I want you to... to... deliver your payload.
Those are men up there.
You're out of line.
You wanna tell me how to do my job?
I've been in that situation.
There's more at risk than your personal life.
If you can't accept that or operate effectively in these circumstances, you'd better leave the decisions to people in this room who can!
OTC, do you copy?
Roger, Houston.
We're waiting on those O2 calculations.
Michelle!
- They're gonna die!
- You don't know that.
It's unconscionable putting that payload before those men's lives!
I think she's right, Mulder.
You saw him in there.
He's losing it.
- He saved their lives earlier.
- Or put them in unnecessary jeopardy.
If he can't deliver that payload, Congress will kill the Space Program.
- So will killing the astronauts.
- Somebody must have sabotaged the shuttle.
Too many things have gone wrong.
- l think Colonel Belt knows about it.
- We've got to stop him.
- Pull them out of orbit!
- He doesn't want them to die.
- How do you know?
- l know it. I'm sure of it.
- He put them up there!
- And only he can get them down alive.
How can you be certain that what he's doing isn't gonna save their lives?
Now, I need access to your records, in a hurry.
Everything on the Hubble telescope, Mars Observer and the current orbiter mission.
Tens of thousands of documents.
- What are we looking for?
- X-rays, diagrams, schematics.
- Proof that Belt knew about a sabotage.
- A needle in a haystack.
Payload deployment initiated.
Roger that, OTC.
Tracking it now.
Looks good from here.
Payload delivery is complete, Houston.
We're awaiting your order.
System check for re-entry de-orbit burn.
Holy God!
There's something outside the ship that...
- There's someone outside the ship!
- Can you repeat that, OTC?
There's... some kind of ghost outside the ship!
No...
No...
Mulder?
I found it.
This is the same diagram that was sent to Michelle.
Ordered by Colonel Belt.
Which means he knew about the faulty valve.
This is from the Challenger. lt's the O-ring fitting that failed, dated January 21st, 1986.
One week before the space shuttle blew up.
The analysis was ordered by Colonel Belt.
So he might have known about the Challenger defect?
Something weird is going on here, Scully.
Colonel Belt's collapsed.
He's in his office.
He was just here!
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with him?
Get a doctor.
Help me!
- Help me!
- How can we help you, Colonel?
He's having some kind of a seizure.
Come on!
Come on, come on!
No...
They're... tearing me apart!
Let me see if I can get a pulse.
Oh...
Help me!
- l'm bringing that shuttle down.
- No!
- lt's out there!
- Come on, let's put him down.
- Spacesuit...
- Easy, easy.
- Strap him down!
- Give him 10mg of diazepam!
- No!
- He's gonna hurt himself!
He's trying to tell us something!
Colonel Belt?
- Those men are running out of oxygen.
- They don't have to die.
Colonel Belt, I want you to focus.
Focus your breathing.
Focus your pain... right here.
Blood pressure's 174 over 120.
Vitals are rising.
- Mulder, you're risking an aneurysm.
- Focus!
Now you're focused.
Right here.
Now you're gonna save those astronauts and you're gonna tell me how to do it.
The shuttle... can't survive re-entry.
- He's lying.
- How do you know it can't survive?
The fuselage... the fuselage is damaged.
- The silicone tiles are destroyed.
- How does he know?
- How has it been damaged?
- l'm responsible.
- Did you sabotage the shuttle?
- No, but I couldn't stop them.
Nobody could stop them!
- Stop who?
- Pulse is 194.
- You'll kill him, Mulder!
- Stop who?
They don't want us to know!
- They don't want us to know!
- Who?
!
It came to me. lt lives in me!
It's coming at me!
It's coming at me!
No!
Help me!
It's coming back!
That's the face I saw in the fog!
- We're losing him!
- V-fib!
Here you go.
Clear!
They just ran out of oxygen.
They've got 30 minutes left in the emergency system.
They'll suffocate up there. I've got to bring them down. lt's the only chance I've got.
Again.
Hold on.
We've got vitals.
We got a pulse.
We've got to get him to a hospital.
OTC, this is Houston, Mission Control.
Do you copy?
Roger, Houston.
We've got some spooky stuff up here.
OTC, we're gonna bring you down.
We want you to instigate de-orbit burn and begin deceleration.
Roger, Houston.
We kinda hoped you'd say that.
Activating OMS rockets.
All systems go for re-entry.
They're bringing the shuttle down.
You said the shuttle would burn up on re-entry.
Can we do anything to save it?
Change the trajectory.
- Change the trajectory to what?
- Change re-entry trajectory to 35 degrees.
T minus 35 seconds to ionosphere re-entry.
- Change the re-entry trajectory!
- What?
- Change it to 35 degrees!
- 30 seconds to re-entry.
- Colonel Belt...
- l can't!
- 25 seconds.
- lt's your only shot!
We'd have to change site and tell them before the blackout.
15 seconds to blackout.
I want to know the weather in Albuquerque!
Are we go for an emergency landing?
Landing conditions go in Albuquerque.
T minus 5 seconds to blackout.
OTC, change your re-entry trajectory to 35 degrees.
You'll land at Kirtland Field in Albuquerque.
Do you copy?
- Blackout in effect.
- Did they get that transmission?
- Two minutes to re-establish.
- Damn it!
- How much oxygen do they have?
- 16 minutes.
OTC, this is Houston.
Come in, OTC.
OTC, this is Houston.
Come in, OTC!
Anything?
- What's the point of their new re-entry?
- 500 miles west of Hawaii.
See if Hawaii can...
- Hawaii's got them on radar.
- They made it.
Not necessarily.
Albuquerque, do you have radar confirmation?
Negative, Houston.
Nothing on the screen.
OTC, this is Houston.
Come in, OTC.
OTC, this is Houston!
Come in, OTC!
Houston, this is OTC.
You know a good place to eat in Albuquerque?
Thought we could meet for dinner.
Whoo!
OTC, welcome home.
Welcome home, OTC.
You're lookin' real good.
Yes!
The space shuttle touched down today at 10.56 Central Standard Time.
The orbiter delivered its payload after just 13 orbits and returned to Earth
without incident.
We at NASA are looking forward to our next shuttle mission and to future successful explorations of space, for mankind and for the future of mankind.
No more!
I just heard.
Something had possessed him.
Something he must have seen out there in space.
The doctors who examined him said he was experiencing severe dementia.
I don't think he ever really knew exactly how it was working through him.
Or, if he ever knew, that he was...
responsible for his own actions.
He ordered those X-rays of the damaged parts.
You saw what I saw, Scully.
I think he was trying to warn her.
I think he sent Michelle those X-rays like...
he was trying to reach out to her, without quite knowing why.
As if his own instinctual impulse was to... save those men.
While simultaneously trying to kill them?
Scully, we send those men up into space to unlock the doors of the universe.
And we don't even know what's behind them.
I think whatever it was, he took it with him.
In the end, that was the only way he knew how to stop it.
There's an investigation, you know.
They haven't ruled out foul play.
He gave his own life.
As an astronaut, that was something he was prepared to do.
Colonel Marcus Aurelius Belt devoted his life to the exploration and understanding of space.
Learning its mysteries and experiencing it not just for himself, but for humanity.
Lord, take this man's soul and let it rise up to your heavens, higher than he could ever go as a man.
Let him know the true nature of the universe that he sought to learn.

I made this!
english
I'm not a killer.
And I never meant to hurt no one.
But I'm tired of my cattle being butchered a hundred miles from the slaughterhouse.
That's the fourth one this month.
- Who or what do you think was responsible?
- That cow was like a shredded piece of paper.
No animal could have done that.
Then are you saying that a person, or persons, was responsible for this?
I want to remind you that Mr Parker is free on bond, pending trial.
He's speaking with you solely in regards to this incident and not about any other pending litigation.
So we can't talk about his court case against the Trego Indian Reservation?
That's exactly what I mean.
- Wait a damn second!
- Jim, don't say a word.
Forget that lawyer crap.
I wanna get this out in the open!
You think I killed an Indian
- just because we're arguing about land!
- We wanna settle that peacefully, in court.
Well, Joseph Goodensnake is dead with a wound from your shotgun.
All I'm saying, it was no kind of animal that I know of.
It damn well didn't seem human neither!
Take a look at my boy's scars.
It was dark.
We heard a growl.
We went out to protect the cattle.
I could've swore I saw red eyes and fangs.
I thought my boy Lyle was...
Look, nobody, nobody was more shocked and upset than I was to find out it was that young Indian boy.
But if he killed our cattle, I'm very, very sorry that we had to find out about it that way.
But as far as I'm concerned, that's the end of it!
- Can we see the corral?
- l'll take you out there.
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah?
Agent Scully?
I suppose if I were hearin' our side of the story, it might not hold up too well.
Parts of it I don't understand myself, things my father could never explain to a stranger.
What kinds of things?
For the last few months, whenever we'd go out at night and check on the cattle, we never saw anything out of the ordinary - not a mountain lion, not a coyote.
Not even any Tregos, Agent Scully.
But I could feel it, something not human,... out there, watching me.
The air was more still and the night animals more quiet.
It was like nature herself was terrified.
It gave me the creeps.
The creeps?
Yeah.
The creeps.
Don't you ever get the creeps?
The victim was shot there.
About three metres from where Parker fired.
There's no way he could have mistaken a person for an animal.
It's open and shut, Mulder.
You know, I'm surprised you volunteered for this assignment.
Any Bureau agent could have investigated this homicide.
Why are you interested?
Well, there seems to be nothing unexplainable about this case.
Nope.
Not a thing.
Mulder, this is so odd.
It's almost like a snakeskin that's been shed.
I suspect the Parkers killed Goodensnake, but they don't seem the type to skin their victim.
Besides which, police and coroner's report make no mention of it.
We're going to have to take a look at the body ourselves.
The body's with the reservation authorities.
We're supposed to get in touch with
Sheriff Charlie Tskany.
Excuse me, we're not from around here.
We're looking for Sheriff Tskany.
Anyone know Charlie Tskany?
Go home, fbi.
How'd you know?
I could smell you a mile away.
They told me that even though my deodorant is for a woman, it's strong enough for a man.
I was at Wounded Knee in 1973.
And what I learned fighting the fbi is you don't believe in us...
and we don't believe in you.
I want to believe.
Why are you here?
What are you looking for?
You already know what we're looking for.
- You tell me what I know.
- We're looking for any individuals who have information on the homicide of...
We're looking for anything that can create human tracks in one step and animal tracks in the next.
Parker...
He found what you're looking for.
He killed what you're looking for, fbi.
What Parker and his kid killed was my brother!
And you're all too afraid of some stupid Indian legend to do anything!
I hate it!
Gwen!
I hate suits who are here when they want something, but if we need help they're nowhere to be found.
Sheriff Tskany?
I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.
Goodensnake's body is in my office.
Bill, Tom, let 'em through.
Come on, boys, let 'em through.
- Who are they?
- Guardians of the dead.
They escort the deceased spirits to the new world.
I only let them as far as the front door.
I keep the ancient beliefs out there and the police work in here.
The woman in the pool hall said that people were afraid of some Indian legend.
What do they believe about the Parker case?
I'm not a park ranger here to answer all your questions about Indians.
Whenever I need federal help, I never get it!
Since this case falls under the jurisdiction of the fbi, you're entitled to examine the body.
So let's get it over with.
- Was the woman in the pool hall his sister?
- Gwen.
She and Joe were primarily responsible for fuelling the boundary dispute with Parker.
They felt that he'd been grazing his cattle too far onto the reservation.
Parker probably told you he wanted to settle in court, but Joe and Gwen filed the suit.
Take a look at that scar tissue.
Yeah.
Looks like an animal attack as well.
Could Joe have been attacked?
- Maybe the Parkers did see an animal.
- No.
Those wounds have been healing for quite some time.
The shotgun wound indicates point-blank range.
The pellets entered the body in a single mass.
The assailant couldn't have been more than three feet away.
We need to take a look at Joe Goodensnake's dental records.
These are the canine cuspids.
They're normal.
Maybe his records were switched or misplaced.
The second incisor is chipped, just like the ones in his mouth.
These match Joe Goodensnake's.
There are cases of calcium phosphate salts developing abnormally with age, but...
That could account for what Jim Parker claims to have seen.
He was out that night expecting to see a mountain lion.
He gets rattled and the flashlight catches Joe here.
So Parker saw what he wanted to see - an animal.
Lyle was attacked.
He has scars just like Joe.
is there a facility where we can
- perform an autopsy?
- Why?
If Joe's teeth are abnormal, an autopsy might reveal abnormalities in his internal anatomy.
I can't allow that.
- l'm fully qualified.
- No, I can't let you do an autopsy.
- The funeral is tonight.
- lt's a cremation.
Then we'll have nothing.
The Tregos believe that the recent dead are unsettled by their new condition as spirits.
Any desecration of the body angers the spirit and keeps it haunting this world.
But as a law enforcement officer, you can't destroy evidence.
Don't tell me what I can't do.
Native Americans believe there are laws greater than that of the US Government.
If they want Joe at rest, rather than used as a piece of evidence, that's how it's gonna be.
If you want to make an issue out of it to your higher authority, go right ahead.
Charlie?
Do you believe that the spirit of Joe Goodensnake is in that room?
All I know is tomorrow, the day after, you're gonna leave.
But I have to stay here.
I've gotta answer to these people.
You can continue your investigation, but without Joe Goodensnake's body.
Mulder, since we've been here you've acted as if you've expected to find all the evidence that we've come across.
What aren't you telling me?
Why are we here?
A true piece of history, Scully.
The very first X-File.
initiated by J Edgar Hoover himself in 1946.
In World War ll, a series of murders occurred in the Northwest, seven here in Browning.
Each victim was basically ripped to shreds and eaten as if by a wild animal.
However, many of the victims were found at home, as if they allowed their killer to enter.
In 1946, police cornered what they believed to be such an animal in a cabin in Glacier National Park.
They shot it.
But when they went in to retrieve the carcass, they found only the body of Richard Watkins.
- Sounds like the Parker scenario.
- The murders stopped that year.
Because the cases were unsolved and considered so bizarre,
Hoover locked them away, hoping that they would be forgotten.
This file indicates that they started again in 1954.
And '59, '64, '78, and now again in '94.
- But...
- Here it comes.
These animal-man related murders predate the oldest X-File by 150 years.
Members of the Lewis and Clark expedition wrote of Indian men who could change into a wolf.
Mulder, what this... what this folder describes is called lycanthropy.
It's a type of insanity in which an individual believes that he can turn into a wolf.
I mean, no one can physically change into an animal!
What about the evidence?
Tracks in the mud, the shredded skin,
- a man with the teeth of an animal.
- Even if you're right and Joe Goodensnake did have the ability to transform physically into an animal, he's dead!
Jim Parker shot him and in a couple of moments his body will be burned.
End of mystery.
Let's hope so.
You don't belong here.
- Gwen...
- You're only around to wrap up your case.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about your brother.
I feel sad for anyone who loses a part of their family.
A part?
He was my whole family.
I'm it now.
As a demonstration of sorrow I'm supposed to give away all my brother's possessions.
Gwen, I don't know what to say.
It's no big deal.
He had more possessions than he had friends.
I read the report of your investigation into the Goodensnake homicide. it was very good.
It was thorough, professional.
But what I want to know is off the record.
What do you think really happened?
Your explanation, Agent Mulder, is lying on that burial platform.
Why don't you just accept that and go home?
Charlie, do you believe in shape-shifting?
This is a funeral.
- Get out of here!
- Please, I want to show my respects.
I don't want your respects!
I want your heart to grow cold.
I want you to feel what I'm feeling!
I think you'd better leave, Mr Parker.
I wish your brother could be here.
I wish that more than anything else.
The body's been mutilated. I'd say he's been attacked by a large predator.
Or somebody wanted it to look that way.
Do you think this is retaliation for Joe Goodensnake?
I don't know.
Have you talked to Gwen Goodensnake?
She seemed pretty upset last night.
She's gone.
Nobody's seen her since the funeral. I've put an APB out on her.
And what about Lyle Parker?
We can't find him either.
He could be dead as well.
I'll take a look around.
That's not from any animal I've ever seen.
Sheriff, I think it's time we had a talk.
An exchange of ideas?
Mulder!
Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital.
He's suffering from exposure.
When he's been checked out, I'm going to question him.
What are you hiding?
- l thought it was over.
- Over?
is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy on Joe Goodensnake's body?
You thought it would all end when he was cremated?
What were you afraid we'd find?
I can't tell you, but I'll take you to somebody who can.
I'm ashamed to say it after what happened at the funeral.
I picked up some bourbon and I don't remember a thing after that.
When I'm down, I go out to where we keep stray animals that wander in on the ranch.
I just watch 'em, you know.
It keeps things in perspective.
Anyway, my mom, when she was alive, was the one that started keeping those animals.
I guess I go out there and think about her too.
God, I must have been really wasted to run around there naked.
I must have thought I was one of those animals.
When you did go home, did you talk to your father?
No, he'd have been mad I even went to the funeral.
I... I have an image of him... sitting on the front porch, but I don't remember talking to him.
Why?
Your father's dead.
I'm sorry.
It appears as if he's been... attacked by an animal, but... I suspect it may be homicide.
Lyle,...
I lost my father recently and I know how overwhelming...
Was it my fault?
By going to the funeral, did it anger them into killing my father?
I don't know.
I can deal with death, you know.
Livin' on the ranch, being close to nature and all, you see how it all works.
Things are born, things die.
Everything else falls in-between.
But if I caused it... lf l brought it on... I couldn't...
I... I saw it once with my own eyes.
It was a long time ago.
It seemed like a dream.
I was a boy.
Was that 1946?
The Watkins case?
I sense you are different, fbi.
You're more open to Native American belief than some Native Americans.
You even have an Indian name.
Fox.
You should be "Running Fox" or "Sneaky Fox".
Just as long as it's not "Spooky Fox".
Now tell me, lsh, what did you see?
Watkins had been attacked by an animal when he was alone in the woods.
His scars healed. lt was forgotten.
Then... the murders began.
The Tregos,... we realised that Watkins had been attacked by what the Algonquians call the manitou.
An evil spirit capable of changing a man into a beast.
To be attacked by a manitou causes the victim to become one.
The healed scars on Joe Goodensnake's body.
The manitou overtakes a man by night, not by full moon, but when its blood lust builds to uncontrollable level, the man changes to a sickening creature.
It kills, releasing the savage energy.
The man returns to his true self, unaware of what has happened.
The cycle begins anew the next day.
This continues until death.
One night, when I was 16 years old, I was coming back from fishing at the Cut Bank Creek.
I knew a short cut behind Watkins' house.
There was a... a groan,... not animal, but not human.
I looked into his window.
He was covered in sweat and blood.
He was in a great, great pain.
His arm, the skin ripped,... it tore off and fell to the floor.
Claws sprang from his fingernails.
He turned, screaming,... and he saw me.
His eyes...
His eyes were still human.
They begged me to kill him.
If I had been hunting and had my gun, I'd have done it without a second thought.
But being a boy... and scared to death, I ran away.
Shortly after, the police killed him.
But the manitou rose again.
Eight years later.
But with Watkins dead, how could there have been an attack by a manitou?
Watkins had a son.
It can be passed along bloodlines.
Gwen!
If Joe Goodensnake was this creature, perhaps it didn't originate in him by the first attack, but was handed down through the bloodlines.
Gwen could have it also.
Gwen could have killed Parker.
Gwen!
Hey!
No!
No!
No!
You're under arrest, Gwen, for stealing lsh's car!
What are you running away from?
I saw it!
I...
I saw it kill Parker.
Let her up.
I went there... after the funeral.
I was gonna mess up the kid, so I waited, but Parker was on the porch.
And then this thing, this animal...
Oh, my God!
I've never been so scared.
I ran and I hid in the woods all day!
I wanted to get out!
I wanted to get outta here!
I wanted to get outta here!
Bring her inside.
Thank you.
Hello, this is Dr Joseph.
This is Agent Mulder, FBl. I was told I could reach Agent Scully at this number.
Oh, yes.
We released Lyle Parker and she's taking him back to the ranch.
- l can reach her there?
- They just left.
Agent Mulder, there's something you should know.
I received the blood test performed on Lyle.
Something's rather unsettling.
What's that?
Traces of his father's blood type.
It can only be there through ingestion.
- The power's out.
- lt happens to us all the time being out here in the sticks.
I'll fire up the generator.
Are you OK?
I feel sick.
Please, help me into the bathroom.
Damn!
It keeps disconnecting.
The mountains must be blocking the signal.
- How much farther?
- About seven miles.
Lyle?
Let me come in.
Lyle, I want to take you back to the hospital, OK?
No!
I'll be all right.
Lyle?
Lyle, answer me.
Lyle, are you all right?
Scully!
It's OK, it's me. lt's me.
OK.
I don't know what happened.
Something jumped me downstairs.
- l lost my gun.
- l heard it come up here.
- Come on.
- OK.
Are you all right?
Oh, my God!
He was in the bathroom, sick.
The next thing I knew we were attacked by the mountain lion.
- lt wasn't the mountain lion.
- lt's still in the cage out back.
Where's Gwen?
She said she'd come see us before we left.
She left last night.
Gave away all her possessions to her friends.
She just pulled up and left?
Why would she do that?
Her brother's gone, no family, the trouble with Parker is all over.
Maybe she saw something that she wasn't ready to understand.
Maybe.
Well, thank you.
fbi!
See you in about... eight years.
I hope not.

I made this!

Kids...
Mom!
Mom!
Kevin!
Mom!
Ruby's gone!
Ruby?
Agent Mulder's latest 302.
Requesting assignment and travel expenses for the both of you.
Sioux City, Iowa.
That's the first I've heard of it.
It came up through channels, from Mulder's ASAC to the District G-14, then my desk.
I don't understand.
In essence, Mulder is petitioning the Bureau to assign a case number to a tabloid headline.
- He must have more evidence than...
- Not according to his 302.
I admit, that is strange.
Even for Mulder.
Perhaps it has something to do with this.
Take a look.
An X-File?
Has he shared this with you?
There's no need to protect him.
He initiated the file himself.
She was his sister.
She disappeared 21 years ago.
He was 12 and she was 8.
He claims that he was in the room when it happened.
He recalls a...
bright light outside the window and a presence in the room.
In your opinion, has Agent Mulder's personal agenda clouded his professional judgement?
In my opinion, no.
But you can see how it might appear that way?
As you know,
Mulder's preoccupation with fringe matters has been a source of friction in the Bureau.
This is another case in point.
I'm going to disallow the 302.
With respect, sir, at least let me talk with him and make a recommendation.
It just doesn't seem substantial enough to warrant an investigation.
So we disagree.
It's not the first time, it won't be the last.
- lf we had a legitimate source...
- This is the essence of science.
Ask an impertinent question, you're on your way to a pertinent answer.
What makes this case any more credible than the 100-year-old mother with the lizard baby?
Because the lizard baby wasn't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee.
Oko-what?
Bogee.
Okobogee.
is that supposed to mean something to me?
If you know anything about trout fishing.
Or UFO hot spots.
Define hot spot.
Four sightings in 1967, August, including one by a National Weather Service plane.
This is a light-blasted digitally-enhanced enlargement.
The pilot took that?
Try a Girl Scout with an lnstamatic.
Four girls said they saw something.
Five, including the Den Mother.
The Air Force said it was a weather balloon.
But no weather balloon was launched that day within 700 miles.
Now read me the names of those Girl Scouts from 1967.
Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston, Doreen McCallister, Darlene Mor... lt's the same Darlene Morris.
Darlene Morris?
I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder.
We talked with you on the phone last night.
Please come in.
Well, I knew that if I screamed loud and long enough that someone would listen.
But I never expected the fbi.
This is Kevin.
Kevin, say hi.
Would you like some coffee?
Some days I can't even get myself up out of bed.
And Kevin has been acting so strange.
I don't know what to do any more.
I just want her back again.
Ms Morris, during the divorce, was there a custody battle?
Charles had nothing to do with this.
How can you be so sure?
Because I know what happened.
It's just like it was before.
- Summer of 1967?
The Girl Scout troop?
- How did you know about that?
Your name's on record at the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois.
Really?
A pilot made a similar sighting over the same area on the same day.
They took her, didn't they?
You... you said that, Kevin was there the night it happened?
He didn't see anything.
He was asleep.
Can I talk to him anyway?
Thanks.
You know, I've told this story so many times now.
Go to the newspapers and the police.
And every time I tell it, people get this...
look in their eye.
Just like the look that you've got right now.
Hey, buddy.
Mind if I sit down?
Thanks.
Your mom tells me you've been having nightmares.
I guess so.
- You wanna tell me about 'em?
- No.
All right.
What are you doing?
You making something?
Can I take a look at it?
Thanks.
It's coming from there.
The TV?
Maybe it's a binary sequence.
Could be anything, could be nothing.
I know you're busy.
Look, I know a friend who knows a friend who can get you a ticket to a Redskins game.
You got it!
All right.
You know where to find me?
Thanks, Danny.
So, as I was telling your partner, we found no evidence of kidnap.
No phone call, no ransom note.
- And since we have no body...
- You assumed she ran away?
It wouldn't be the first time Ruby ran away from home.
How do you explain what her mother saw?
I think Darlene has a very active imagination.
I've heard those stories since first grade.
So, basically, you ignored her statement.
- l included it in my report.
- But you didn't bother to check it out.
We found nothing at the campsite.
Let me tell you something.
Darlene's little girl was no prom queen.
I can't count the number of times I pulled her out of parked cars or found her puking her guts out.
- lt was just a matter of time before...
- Before what?
Before something bad happened. lf Darlene makes up stories to get past that, fine.
But don't tell me it's the truth.
I'm not gonna waste my time.
I just think it's a good idea not to antagonise local law enforcement.
Who, me?
I'm Mr Congeniality.
We might need his help one of these days.
I'll send him a Bundt cake.
You're looking for Ruby, right?
That's right.
Who are you?
Doesn't matter.
Are you a friend of Ruby's?
Ruby didn't have friends.
She just had people she liked to hang with.
And she liked to hang out with you?
I guess we had some times.
- Like the night she disappeared?
- lt was Greg.
She was supposed to see him that night.
- Who's Greg?
- Her boyfriend, Greg Randall.
Supposed to meet up at the lake.
They had stuff to talk about.
What kind of stuff?
Greg got Ruby pregnant.
Whatever.
She got herself pregnant.
Do you know what they were planning to do about it?
They were gonna leave town.
At least that's what Ruby told me.
You know Greg from school?
Greg?
School?
I don't think so.
All he ever did since we met him was pour beer.
The Pennsylvania Pub.
Excuse me!
Do you know where we can find Greg Randall?
Who's asking?
What kind of trouble's he in now?
We were hoping you could tell us.
Greg called in sick three weeks ago.
I haven't heard from him since.
Any ideas where he might have gone?
No, but if you find him, tell him he's fired.
This is our hotel if you hear of anything.
That's a nice tattoo.
What is that?
What's it look like?
A flying saucer.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?
I take it you don't?
No, I think it's just a bunch of crazy people howling at the moon.
So, you haven't been out to Lake Okobogee, have you?
No, I haven't.
Why?
You should ride with us some time.
You might see some things that'd change your mind.
Get a killer sunburn in the middle of the night.
Where's Mulder?
Where did you get the document?
If you explain what you're talking about, maybe I can help.
This is a document?
It just looks like a bunch of ones and zeros to me.
- Tell me where you got it.
- Tell me what it is.
Keep playing games and you'll be facing the D6.
You can explain to them why you're obstructing justice.
It's your call, Holtzman.
But I'm not accountable to anybody outside my subcommittee.
I don't care if it's the NSA or the Vatican police.
It's a defence satellite transmission.
You're kidding!
A fragment, but highly classified.
We need to know where it came from.
Well, sure.
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
You just bought yourself a one-way back to Washington.
We got it.
Great.
What?
You shouldn't have told 'em.
They have no jurisdiction.
Mulder, they're NSA.
They think the boy's a threat to national security.
How can an 8-year-old boy who can barely multiply be a threat to national security?
People call me paranoid.
How did Kevin obtain top-secret information?
Where do you think he got it from?
Watch your step, ma'am.
It'll be OK, baby.
Don't worry.
- lt'll be OK.
- Come with me, son.
Mom!
It'll be all right, baby.
Watch your head, please.
You guys do really delicate work.
Let's get this to Cryptography.
I think we got what we needed.
Thank you.
- What is it?
- l'm not sure.
- We scanned it through the mainframe.
- And none of the information is actionable?
Other than the satellite transmission, none of it is a national security risk.
The boy's being released later.
So it was just a random set of ones and zeros?
There was nothing random about it.
I don't understand.
All information can be rendered digitally in a series of ones and zeros.
When we downloaded the data, we found an amazing range of...
Well, see for yourself.
Da Vinci's Universal Man.
A DNA double helix.
There's lots more.
That's the Brandenburg Concertos.
But they're just fragments.
Some lines from the Koran, a Shakespearean sonnet.
Like someone's switching channels?
- Mrs Morris?
- l have nothing to say to you.
Please, give me a minute to explain.
Would you please just wait over there for mama?
I'll be right there.
- l thought you were supposed to help us.
- This has been a terrible mistake.
The government will pay for all repairs and damages.
I don't want your money.
I want my daughter back.
And I want you to leave us alone.
But your son has seen something.
You stay away from me and you stay away from my child.
Come on, honey.
It's OK.
Let's go now.
I thought we were headed back into town.
Where are we going?
The boy is the key, Scully. I know it.
- The key to what?
- Finding Ruby.
Just think about it for a minute.
He's receiving digitised data from a television screen.
Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration.
- l admit it's not much of an explanation...
- l think that Kevin is a conduit of some kind.
A conduit?
A link... or a connection to whoever or whatever took Ruby that night.
But how?
If there was an abduction, it's likely that Kevin was touched in some way.
Mulder, I know what you're thinking.
I know why this is so important to you.
I know!
But there is no evidence indicating an abduction.
That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.
According to the police photos, Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.
Just a stone's throw from the forest wall.
Meaning what?
Meaning anybody could have come out of the forest to grab her.
Have you noticed the tree line?
Evidence of extreme heat.
Or an electrical storm.
Besides which, there's nothing to connect it to the night
- of Ruby's disappearance.
- That's true.
Do you think lightning could have caused this?
Do you have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass?
2,500° Fahrenheit.
Something was out here.
Something hot enough to turn sand into glass.
To singe those trees and to blister the roof of that camper.
Mulder!
Look!
What is it?
It's a grave.
Shallow, by the smell of it.
What are you doing?
Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene.
Stop!
What if it's her?
I need to know.
Are you OK, Mulder?
Fine.
Looks like a male Caucasian.
Sir.
Victim's name was Greg Randall.
- Ruby's boyfriend.
- Ruby had a lot of boyfriends.
- Can I take a look at that?
- Go right ahead.
Look at that.
It's her.
The girl from the library.
Who?
We didn't get her name, but she claimed Greg and Ruby had run off together.
Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy of mine.
Delivered both my kids.
I can find out who had that appointment.
Have a seat, Tessa.
We know that you lied to us the other day.
We know that you had the appointment with Dr Fowler on August 7th.
We know that you're pregnant, not Ruby.
- Then you don't know nothing.
- We can prove it, Tessa.
And we can prove that Greg... was the father.
So what if he was the father?
This is very serious.
Do you understand how serious this is?
You've waived the right to an attorney.
So if you lie to us here today, you could be charged with perjury.
He promised me we'd be in LA by Christmas.
He had a friend there.
And I'd never seen the ocean.
You said he and Ruby were seeing each other.
You said they were planning to meet at the lake. ls that true?
Lookit, I was nowhere near the lake that night, OK?
Sure you were, Tessa.
You knew they were meeting, so you sat and you waited for them.
- You were angry and jealous.
- l wasn't.
You waited, and when they showed you killed him first, isn't that how it went?
- No.
- You snuck up and you shot him in the back.
Bam!
And then you killed Ruby.
Bam!
What was she doin' before she died?
Was she pleading for her life?
Was she running away?
I didn't kill her!
- Where's she buried?
- l don't know!
- You don't know where you buried her?
- l didn't kill her!
- You didn't?
- She wasn't even there that night!
Well, how would you know that, Tessa, if you weren't there yourself?
You're not seeing the whole picture here.
- Which is?
- Which is that in all likelihood Ruby is dead.
is that your conclusion or the Sioux City Sheriff's Department's?
They're searching the National Park and a dive team is going to drag the lake.
They're wasting their time.
Do you really think Tessa is telling the truth?
Why not?
What if Ruby never did show up that night?
She lied to us in the library and lied about her pregnancy.
Why wouldn't she lie about killing Ruby?
Because something was out there in those woods!
We have a suspect in custody.
We have a confession to one murder and a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another.
It's over, Mulder. lt's time to turn this over to local law enforcement.
I can't do that.
- Mulder, where are you going?
- To talk to the boy.
- Darlene won't let you.
- l've gotta see him.
They don't want anything to do with us!
Mulder, stop!
Stop running after your sister.
This won't bring her back.
Come with me or don't, but until they find a body I'm not giving up on that girl.
Hello?
Mrs Morris?
Kevin?
Mulder?
What does it mean?
I don't know.
I'm gonna check upstairs.
Oh, my God!
What is it?
Just come up here.
Look.
It's her!
It's Ruby.
This is a long shot.
They could be anywhere.
You know, when I was a kid I had this ritual.
I'd close my eyes before I walked into my room.
Because I thought one day when I opened them my sister would be there.
Just lying in bed...
like nothing ever happened.
I'm still walking into that room.
Every day of my life.
Scully!
Darlene!
Look, there's a trailhead.
- Are you OK?
- lt's here. I saw it.
- Where's Kevin?
- l couldn't keep up.
Go ahead!
Kevin!
- Are you OK?
- She's back!
Kevin, I'm sorry, but...
She's here. I know it!
Kevin, I don't think she is.
- l know you wanted it to be her. I did too.
- Mulder!
Come on!
Scully?
Ruby!
She's unconscious but alive.
I'll get help.
She's been awake for almost an hour.
Any ideas what caused the coma?
No sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces or electrolyte abnormalities.
But her white blood cell count was sky-high.
Any attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or release of glucocorticoids?
Actually, both.
How did you know that?
They're symptoms of prolonged weightlessness.
Shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances.
Hi.
Hi, Ruby.
Who are you?
We're with the FBl. I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder.
My mom said you might be coming by.
How are you feeling?
Fine, I guess.
Where were you, Ruby?
Can you tell us?
It's OK, Ruby.
He knows.
I'm not supposed to tell.
They told me not to say.
Who told you?
Ruby, who told you?
Sweetheart, you don't have to say anything.
You're right.
We should wait till Ruby gets a little stronger.
Can we speak outside for a moment?
I think that it's best that we put all of this behind us.
I mean, hasn't Ruby been through enough already?
I know how disoriented she must seem right now.
But in a couple of weeks, we... I don't want her talking to you.
Or anyone.
She should be encouraged to tell her story.
It's important that you let her.
Important to who?
I have my daughter back.
I don't want more trouble.
Besides, she can't remember anything.
But she will remember one day, even if it's only in dreams.
When she does, she'll want to talk about it.
She'll need to talk about it.
Like I did?
Listen to me.
I have been ridiculed for speaking my mind.
But it was the truth, Darlene.
It's caused me nothing but heartache.
I don't want the same thing for her.
It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.
As far as I know, she spent the last month on the back of a Harley-Davidson.
is that what you'll tell Kevin?
I'm sorry.
- Your eyes are open?
- Yeah, but it's like
- nothing's happening.
- Try turning your head.
I can't.
- Why not?
- l don't know.
I can't move.
So I don't.
- l just lie there in bed.
- Can you see your sister?
No.
But I can hear her.
- What does she say?
- She's calling out my name over and over again.
She's crying out for help.
But I can't help her.
I can't move.
- Are you scared?
- l know I should be, but I'm not.
- Do you know why?
- Because of the voice.
- The voice?
- The voice in my head.
- What's it telling you?
- Not to be afraid.
It's telling me that no harm will come to her.
And that one day she'll return.
Do you believe the voice?
I want to believe.
I want to believe.
Visiontext subtitles by Susan Voas
I made this!
english
What's she doing there by herself?
- Tina?
- Honey?
You're freezing.
Where's yourjacket?
Where's your daddy?
In the yard.
He told me he needed some time to himself.
I'd say his time's up.
Come on, honey, I'm sure he wouldn't want you to catch cold.
Joel?
Hey, Joel, the swing set's supposed to be for your daughter, not you!
I'll call 911.
Daddy?
Death by hypovolemia.
75o/o blood loss.
That's over four litres of blood.
You could say the man was running on empty.
The man's daughter, eight years old, was away from his side for no more than 10 minutes.
She doesn't remember anything.
There was no trace evidence.
It would've been washed away by yesterday's rain.
There were two puncture wounds in the jugular.
Are you familiar with the phenomenon of cattle mutilations?
Since 1967, over 34 states have reported unsolved cases of cattle mutilation.
The trace evidence is remarkably similar.
lncision marks of surgical precision.
The area around the mouth and often the sexual organs has been removed.
There's substantial blood loss with no blood at the scene.
- How can that be?
- Exsanguination.
If you stuck a needle in the jugular, the heart itself would act as a pump.
These animals had theirjugulars punctured in the same way as the man from Connecticut.
It's the first time I've ever seen it on a human.
There was no sign of a struggle.
How can a man sit through a blood-letting?
The ME found digitalis, a South American plant that can be used as a paralytic drug.
These X-Files indicate this is a UFO-related phenomenon.
Often there are sightings nearby, surface burns.
Witnesses report time loss, as in abduction cases.
That might explain why the girl remembers nothing.
Why would aliens travel light years to Earth in order to play doctor on cattle?
For the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys.
Besides, they seem to have stepped up their interest.
Her mother passed away from ovarian cancer two years ago.
There's no other family.
We'll keep Tina here until we can place her with a foster family.
- Has she spoken about it?
- No, not a word.
- Any nightmares?
- No.
At least not that I know of.
- Can we talk to her now?
- Yes.
Tina, these are the people we talked about.
This is Miss Scully and Mr Mulder.
Do you think you can talk to them?
OK.
Hi.
I know you must be feeling very sad right now.
And scared.
But we wanna find out what happened so we can help stop whoever hurt your daddy, OK?
OK.
Did you ever see any strangers with your daddy at home?
Did you ever see anyone yell at your daddy or your daddy yell at them?
No.
Can you think of anyone who might wanna hurt your daddy?
No.
That's a nice bunny, Tina.
Can we talk about what happened that day?
About what happened in the back yard.
Yeah?
Do you remember any strange sounds or lights or anything like that?
There was red lightning.
Can you tell me more about the red lightning?
I can't remember.
It... all went dark.
Have you ever seen anything like that before?
You have?
When?
The men from the clouds - they were after my dad.
Scully.
- Where?
- Why were these men after your dad?
They wanted to exsanguinate him.
Thanks.
Mulder.
What?
There's been another one.
It's like looking at a mirror image.
"The victim, Doug Reardon, was married with one daughter."
"Cause of death - hypovolemia."
Mulder, this is uncanny.
They also found traces of the poison digitalis.
- Puncture wound?
- Yes.
On the jugular.
Time of death was estimated at 2.30pm.
The same day, only three hours earlier than the Simmons murder.
That's Pacific Standard Time.
That makes it the exact same moment.
It appears we have two serial killers working in tandem.
No, serial killers rarely work in pairs.
When they do, they kill together, not separately.
Nothing beyond your leading questions to Tina substantiates a UFO mutilation theory.
Was Reardon's daughter here when he was murdered?
Yes.
The police report states that she remembers nothing.
She's with her mother and family in Sacramento.
- When will they be back?
- Tomorrow.
Even money she'll remember red lightning.
Tina?
She was kidnapped from the Social Services home at 11pm last night.
Looks like someone was afraid she might remember too much.
Someone or something, Scully.
Connecticut state troopers set up roadblocks within half an hour.
Nothing.
Maybe they weren't looking in the right direction!
I told them to contact us in case they find her.
Tina?
No.
Wh-What's your name?
Cindy Reardon.
Do you live here, Cindy?
Ever since I was born - eight years ago.
This is the ceremonial signing...
Cindy really is a beautiful little girl, Mrs Reardon.
Doug and I wanted to spoil her.
We wanted to protect her from everything horrible in the world.
- She was daddy's little girl.
- ls she an only child?
May I ask... was Cindy adopted?
No!
I gave birth to her at San Rafael General.
I assume you have the documentation, birth certificate...
- Of course I do.
- Was she the only child delivered?
What the hell kind of question is that?
Look, I have told the police everything I know.
Mrs Reardon, have you ever seen this man before?
is this your suspect?
- No.
- Did he do something to Cindy?
- No, h-he...
- No.
Mrs Reardon, this is not your daughter.
That girl's name is Tina Simmons.
She lives 3,000 miles away in Greenwich, Connecticut.
That man, her father, was killed in the same way as your husband.
Cindy is my daughter.
I can show you videos of her birth.
We tried for six years to become pregnant.
In vitro fertilisation?
- At which clinic?
- Luther Stapes Center down in San Francisco.
Do you still believe this is UFO related?
- Cindy didn't see red lightning.
- l don't know.
The only thing similar about these girls does seem to be their appearance.
There is the possibility they have an unrelated likeness.
Who both just happen to see their fathers exsanguinated.
I'd like to get the odds on that in Vegas!
The girls are the one and only link between identical murders.
- And one girl was just abducted.
- Kidnapped.
Potato, po-tah-to.
Where are you going?
If the murders were committed by the same person, and part of the pattern involves kidnapping the daughter...
Then you'd expect the pattern to continue.
I'll keep an eye on the girl.
Check out the clinic.
See if the Simmons were in the same programme.
I'll call the San Francisco Bureau and get someone to relieve you.
OK.
In vitro fertilisation is a procedure in which we implement fertilisation and implantation of the embryo in the uterus.
Could a patient believe she was receiving her own egg but receive another without knowing?
Not here.
We have very strict controls.
Have you ever had patients named Claudia and Joel Simmons?
Any patient information is confidential.
It's our policy.
The Simmons are dead.
Their daughter has been kidnapped.
I'd say any information you have that could help would override your policy.
You had copies of their records transferred to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1991.
They came here nine years ago under the supervision of a Dr Sally Kendrick?
is there a problem?
Dr Kendrick was nothing but a problem.
Hello.
Welcome to the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine.
I'm Dr Sally Kendrick, a specialist in the exciting field of in vitro fertilisation.
She was a resident here in 1985.
Brilliant.
First in her class at Yale Med where she got her MD after completing her doctorate in biogenetics.
We were thrilled to get her.
And now you don't sound so thrilled.
We have reason to believe
Dr Kendrick was tampering with genetic material of fertilised ova in the lab prior to implant.
Experimenting with eugenics.
- Did you report this to the AMA?
- Of course.
I fired her. I also requested an investigation from the US Health Department.
- And what happened?
- The AMA censured her.
My request for an investigation was denied.
Dr Kendrick... disappeared.
We know the pain of infertility, and we are ready to help.
In the next half-hour...
Kendrick was the supervising physician in the Reardons' and the Simmons' ivf programme.
It seems she was experimenting at the clinic.
And maybe now she's trying to erase the results?
..but with our scientific advances, a little luck and a lot of hope, miracles can happen.
She must've had an accomplice to have done both murders.
You think this is a vendetta she and a colleague have against the Center?
Does this mean you've abandoned your UFO connection?
Hello?
Hello?
Just a couple of clicks.
Must be the wrong number.
I tell you what, I'm gonna sleep on it and we'll talk about it in the morning.
Mulder, you're rushing me out of the room.
No, I'm not.
- Do you have a girl coming over?
- What's a girl?
I got a movie I wanna watch on TV.
Sleep tight. I'll see you in the morning.
Are you certain she hasn't followed you?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
Well, I thought we might take in a Warriors game.
Actually, I was... just in the neighbourhood and... wondered if I had ever told you about the Litchfield experiments.
No, you haven't.
Well, it was a most... interesting project.
Highest level of classification, all records have since been destroyed, and those who knew of it will deny knowledge of its existence.
In the early '50s, during the height of the Cold War, we got wind the Russians were fooling around with eugenics.
Rather primitively, I might add.
Trying to cross-breed top scientists, athletes, you name it, to come up with the superior soldier.
Naturally, we jumped on the bandwagon.
The Litchfield experiment.
A group of genetically controlled children were raised and monitored on a compound in Litchfield.
The boys were called Adam and the girls were called...
Eve.
There's a woman you should see, and I'll make sure that you can get in.
Agents Mulder and Scully here to see Eve 6.
Deposit your firearms.
- Sign for these.
- What are those?
Panic buttons.
I can't let you inside without one.
Whaddaya want?
Why the flashlight?
She screams and screams if we turn the overheads on.
No one's ever got a good look at her.
We'll be right outside.
Hello?
So, I guess you've found what you're looking for.
One of us, at least.
Sally Kendrick.
Unlock the chains, then we'll talk.
They're probably there for a good reason.
No... a bad reason.
I paid too much attention to a guard.
Bit into his eyeball!
I meant it as a sign of affection.
You here to give me an iq test, by any chance?
I think I can top 265.
We're very bright, we Eves.
It runs in the family.
Where are the others - the Adams and the Eves?
We're prone to suicide.
All that's left is me and Eve 7 - she escaped early on.
Eve 8, she escaped 10 years later.
Are you Sally Kendrick?
That's not my name, but... she is me and I am her and we are all together!
Did you work for the Luther Stapes Center in 1985?
In 1985, I'd been tied up like this for two years!
And for what reason?
No reason!
I did nothing!
I'm just me!
They made me, but did they suffer?
No, no, I suffer!
I suffer!
They keep me alive for the Litchfield Project!
They come in, they test me, they poke me to see what went wrong!
Sally knows what went wrong.
You and you, you have 46 chromosomes.
The Adams made the Eves.
We have 56.
We have extra chromosomes.
Number 4, 5, 12, 16 and 22.
This replication of chromosomes also produces additional genes.
Heightened strength, heightened intelligence...
Heightened psychosis.
Saved the best for last.
You don't believe me.
I have proof.
Look on my wall.
My family album.
My God, it's the girls!
We were close.
We were very close!
Sally Kendrick was using the clinic to carry on the Litchfield experiment.
She was cloning herself.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.
God bless Grandma and Grandpa Stenner, Irma and lrmapop, and God bless Mom, and please take care of Daddy up in heaven.
You're such a special little girl, Cindy.
Good night, honey.
If Eve 6 is right and there are two other Eves out there, that could account for the two identical murders occurring at exactly the same time.
Sally Kendrick does have an accomplice - herself.
Until I heard that, I'd begun to suspect the girls.
No, it seems the two remaining Eves are doing away with the parents in order to keep Tina and Cindy in the family.
Do you suppose the girls have any idea of what they are?
I hope not.
Let's go!
I'll take the back!
There's someone upstairs.
Wait outside!
fbi!
I'm armed!
Which one are you
- Eve 7 or Eve 8?
Drop it.
You know I'm capable.
Slow.
Very slow.
The suspect's name is Sally Kendrick.
Early 40s, five foot eight, 135 pounds.
She may have an accomplice similar in appearance.
Kendrick is driving a light-blue '93 Corolla.
She has exceptional strength for her size so consider her armed and dangerous.
Quite possibly she'll display severe psychotic behaviour.
The Oakland Bureau will orchestrate the search across the bridge.
What if...
What if she kills her?
First Doug, now Cindy.
The fact that Kendrick and her accomplice just abducted the girls tells us they want them alive.
I'm sure Cindy's alive and we'll find her.
And then what do we do?
I'm sorry you have to meet this way, but it's the best for all concerned.
Tina Simmons, meet Cindy Reardon.
Agent Scully?
They found the Corolla in the parking lot of San Francisco International.
Start a check on every single passenger list for every flight that left in the past 12 hours.
Check every terminal, make sure she's not hiding out for a later flight.
Remember, she may have an accomplice.
A motel in Port Reyes has a guest matching Sally's description.
- The car's at the airport.
- She might've ditched it.
The manager says she checked in with a girl.
She left the hotel in the afternoon alone, then returns with the girl.
Someone else could've picked her up without him knowing.
The area is full of families.
There are hundreds of kids around.
This kid told him to use chlorine to eradicate the dinoflagellates in the swimming pool.
- Does that sound like someone you know?
- That's it.
I've always kept a close eye on your behaviour, no matter where l was.
The last few years I spent in search of the remaining Eve.
That, however, was cut short by your... "activity".
I hoped my work at the Stapes Center had corrected the Litchfield flaws.
Psychotic behaviour didn't develop in the Adams and Eves until age 16.
Homicidal behaviour at 20.
Imagine my... disappointment when I learned of your accelerated development.
How did you learn of each other's existence?
We just knew.
Did you discuss how you would orchestrate your little... prank?
We just knew.
Why murder your fathers?
- They weren't our fathers.
- We have no parents.
We weren't born.
We were created.
You...
You cannot think that way.
You're human beings.
Different, special, but you cannot give in to genetic destiny.
That's why I've taken you.
I was raised by a man who knew what I was.
He was a genetic engineer on the project.
With the proper environment and a programme...
of long-term medication, you can become like me and not the other Eves.
Wh-What have you done?
Your soda, four ounces of foxglove.
Extracted from a digitalis plant.
This much is a lethal dose.
We cultivated them ourselves.
Wh-Why?
- You tell us.
- You made us.
We're your mistake.
I'll c-correct... that mistake!
Well, I waited like you told me.
No one's come in or out.
Get the back!
We were all supposed to drink, but we only pretended to drink it.
They tried to poison us.
Who's "they"?
She and another lady.
What did the other lady look like?
Eve 8.
They were working together.
It's all right, we'll take care of you.
You're safe with us.
Looks like the Eves mixed about four ounces of digitalis in each glass.
Their own mini-Jonestown.
Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide.
It has a sweet flavour, probably not even perceptible in soda.
We're searching the area, but so far there's no sign of the other suspect.
An officer'll take the girls back.
Maybe it'd be best if we take responsibility for the girls.
We can get them checked out by a doctor.
OK, whatever.
Come on, girls, we're gonna take you back.
- Back where?
- What's gonna happen to Tina?
We'll talk about it in the car, OK?
They've already grown so attached.
It's gonna be hard when Tina's placed in care.
Yeah.
Agent Mulder, I have to go to the bathroom.
Me, too.
- Can you hold it?
- l really need to go.
I could use some caffeine.
Hi.
- Where's your bathroom?
- ln the back.
You'll need a key.
Thanks.
- Oh, can I get four diet sodas?
- Regular.
All right, two diet and two regular to go, please.
Thanks.
Agent Scully, my door's stuck.
Just a second.
Just a minute.
It's OK, my dad will pay for them when he gets out of the bathroom.
OK.
- Those are the diet?
- l think these are.
Are you sure?
It's really sweet.
- Try it.
- l know it's diet. I saw her pour it.
- OK.
- Let's go.
Come on.
- Don't forget the drinks.
- Right.
- How much?
- $5.
- Wanna pay?
- Sure.
There you go.
You got those?
Thanks.
Tastes syrupy.
Cindy, did you pick up my keys off the counter?
No.
No?
All right, I'll be right back.
- Scully!
- What?
Scully...
Just wanted to open the car door for you.
Mulder!
It's them.
They poisoned it.
Let's just get them in the car.
I only had a sip.
We didn't drink enough to make us sick.
Scully, I got 'em!
- Leave us alone!
- l got 'em!
Scully!
Hey!
- What the hell are you doing?
- l'm a federal agent!
Yeah, and these are America's Most Wanted?
- Hands in front.
- Leave me alone!
- Let the girls go!
- Get in the truck, girls.
Get in.
- l'm gonna call the police.
- We are the police!
Mulder!
They went that way!
You seen the twins we were with?
No, I...
There's a bunch of schoolkids just left on that bus.
Forget your sodas?
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- We're just little girls.
That's the last thing you are.
They said they have an excellent programme that can help her.
They can't hide behind a bureaucracy, Mrs Reardon.
You have a right to know what happened, a right to know about your daughter.
All I need to know is she was not my daughter.
She never was.
Hello, girls.
It's so nice to have company.
Sign for this.
Hello, Eve 8.
We've been waiting.
How did you know I'd come for you?
- We just knew.
- We just knew.

I made this!

Hi, you've reached the Usher residence.
Please leave a message at the tone.
Thank you.
Hi, honey. it's about 8.30 and, um...
I'm going to be here for a while.
The presentation didn't go so well.
Call me. I love you.
Bye.
Guess who I ran into from our class at Quantico?
- Marty Neil.
- J Edgar Jr?
Just got bumped up.
Foreign Counterintelligence, New York City Bureau.
Supervisory Special Agent.
- Supervisory?
- That's right.
Two years out of the Academy.
How did he land that?
Lucked into the World Trade Center bombing.
Well, good for Marty.
Oh, come on, Dana!
The guy is a loser.
Look where he is now.
It's where we should be.
Brad Wilson told me the psychological profile you wrote on the Washington Crossing killer led them straight to the suspect.
Word has it you're on the Violent Crimes Section's fast track.
So, how are you doing?
Have you had any close encounters of the third kind?
is that what everyone thinks I do?
No, of course not.
But you do work with Spooky Mulder.
Mulder's ideas may be a bit out there, but he is a great agent.
Yeah, well, I've got this case that's out there.
Baltimore PD calls.
They want our help on a serial killer profile.
Three murders.
Began six weeks ago.
Victims vary in age, race, gender.
- No known connections.
- l take it there's a pattern?
Point of entry.
Actually, the lack of one.
What do you mean?
One victim, college girl, killed in her dorm room.
She was found with the windows locked and the door chained from the inside.
The last incident, two days ago.
High-security office building.
Nothing on the security monitors.
Janitor spoke to the victim minutes before.
Didn't hear or see a thing out of the ordinary.
Suicides?
Each victim was found with their liver ripped out.
- No cutting tool was used.
- Bare hands?
- This looks like an X-File.
- Let's not get carried away.
I'm gonna solve these murders, but I would like you to go over the case histories.
Maybe come down to the crime scene.
Do you want me to ask Mulder?
OK. lf he wants to come and do you a favour, great!
But make sure he knows this is my case.
Dana, if I can break a case like this one, I'll be getting my bump up the ladder.
And you...
Maybe you won't have to be Mrs Spooky any more.
- So why didn't they ask me?
- They're friends from the Academy.
I'm sure they just felt more comfortable talking to me.
- Why would I make them so uncomfortable?
- lt probably has to do with your reputation.
Reputation?
I have a reputation?
Colton plays by the book and you don't.
They feel your methods, your theories are...
Spooky?
- Do you think I'm spooky?
- Agent Scully's in here, sir.
Dana!
Sorry I'm late.
We just got here.
Fox Mulder.
Tom Colton.
So, Mulder, what do you think?
Does this look like the work of little green men?
- Grey.
- Excuse me?
Grey.
You said green men.
A Reticulan skin tone is actually grey.
They're notorious for their extraction of terrestrial human livers, due to iron depletion in the Reticulan galaxy.
You can't be serious!
Do you have any idea what liver and onions go for on Reticula?
Excuse me.
Dana, I've been thinking about this and I have a theory.
It might explain a lot.
Tell me what you think.
What if the guy enters the building...
Hold on a second.
What in the hell is he doing?
That vent is 6 inches by about 18.
Even if a Reticulan could crawl through, it's screwed in place.
This is the print l took from Usher's office.
These others are from an X-File.
Ten murders, Baltimore area, undetermined points of entry.
Each victim had their liver removed.
These prints were found at 5 of the 10 crime scenes.
- Ten murders.
Colton never mentioned...
- Most likely he's unaware of them.
These two prints were lifted five years before he was born at Powhattan Mill.
And these three were lifted probably five years before his mother was even born.
Are you saying these prints are from the 1960s and the 1930s?
Fingerprinting was just starting in 1903, but there was a murder with an extracted liver.
Of course.
Now, that's five murders every 30 years.
That makes two more to go this year.
You're saying these are copycats?
What did we learn our first day at the Academy?
Each fingerprint is unique.
These are a perfect match.
Are you suggesting I go before the Violent Crimes Section and present a profile saying these murders are done by aliens?
No!
I find no evidence of alien involvement.
What, then?
This is the work of a 100-year-old serial killer who overpowered a six-foot-two businessman?
He'll stick out in a crowd with ten-inch fingers!
Look, bottom line.
This is Colton's case.
Our X-File dates back to 1903.
We had it first.
Mulder, they don't want you involved.
They don't want to hear your theories.
That's why Blevins has you hidden away down here.
You're down here, too.
Look, why don't we agree to this?
They have their investigation, we have ours.
And never the twain shall meet.
Agreed?
After a careful review of the violent and powerful nature of these murders, I believe the killer to be a male, 25-35 years of age, with above average intelligence.
His manner of entry has so far been undetectable.
This may be due to his knowledge of the inner structure of buildings and duct works.
Or that he in fact hides in plain sight posing as delivery or maintenance workers.
The extraction of the liver is the most significant detail of these crimes.
The liver possesses regenerative qualities.
It cleanses the blood.
The taking of this trophy is the transferring act for the killer to cleanse himself of his own impurities.
I think he is acting under the classic form of obsessive-compulsive behaviour.
Since the victims are unrelated and we cannot predict who will be next, we must use the fact that a killer won't always succeed in finding a victim.
When this occurs a serial killer may return to the site of a previous murder, hoping to recapture the emotional high.
I think our best course of action is to target these sites.
Good job, Agent Scully.
If there are no objections, we'll begin our stakeouts of the murder sites tonight.
We're looking for a male, 25-35, possibly wearing a uniform.
Gas company, UPS, whatever. I know you're assigned to another area, Scully, but you're welcome to come aboard with us on this.
That is if you don't mind working in an area that's a bit more down to earth.
Position ten.
Station check.
Position ten, I copy.
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would you, copper?
- Mulder, what are you doing here?
- He's not coming back.
His thrill comes from the challenge of a seemingly impossible entry.
If you'd read the X-File, you'd come to the same conclusion.
- Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout.
- Seeds?
You're wasting your time.
I'm going home!
Scully!
Call for backup and get over here!
Position ten requesting backup!
In there.
Federal Agent!
I'm armed!
Proceed down the vent.
Slowly!
Cover down to the corner!
She's not by her car!
- Take him!
- Move!
Move!
Move!
fbi.
Don't move!
Don't move!
Get your hands up!
Keep 'em up!
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...
You were right.
You have a right to have an attorney present during questioning.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
is your full name Eugene Victor Tooms?
Yes.
Are you a resident of the state of Maryland?
Yes.
Are you an employee of the Baltimore Municipal Animal Control?
Yes.
is it your intent to lie to me about anything here today?
No.
Were you ever enrolled in college?
Yes.
Were you ever enrolled in medical school?
No.
Have you ever removed a liver from a human being?
No.
Have you ever killed a living creature?
Yes.
Have you ever killed a human being?
No.
Were you ever in George Usher's office?
No.
Did you kill George Usher?
No.
Are you over 100 years old?
- That must be a control question.
- l had her ask it.
No.
Have you ever been to Powhattan Mill?
Yes.
In 1933?
No.
Are you afraid you might fail this test?
Well...
Yes.
Because I didn't do anything.
He nailed it...
A+.
As far as I'm concerned, the subject did not kill those two people.
Maintenance at the office building confirmed the call to Animal Control about a bad smell.
They found a dead cat in the second floor ventilation ducts.
Still doesn't explain why he was there that late at night.
He's a civil servant with initiative and we busted him for it.
He was crawling up an air duct, by himself, without alerting security.
Dana, he passed the test.
His story checks out.
He's not the guy.
It doesn't mean your profile's incorrect.
Scully's right. lt is the guy.
What have you got, Mulder?
He lied on questions 11 and 13.
His electrodermal and cardiographic response nearly go off the chart.
is number 11 the 100-year-old question?
Well, I had a reaction to that stupid question.
And what is this Powhattan Mill thing?
Two murders with matching mos occurred in Powhattan Mill in 1933.
Look at the chart.
My interpretation of those reactions... I don't need you or that machine telling me if Tooms was alive in '33!
He's the guy.
I'm letting him go.
You coming?
Tom, I want to thank you for letting me put in some time with the VCS.
- But I am officially assigned to the X-Files.
- l'll see what I can do about that.
Tom, I can look out for myself.
You said Mulder was out there.
That guy's insane.
You knew they wouldn't believe you.
Why did you push it?
Maybe I thought you caught the right guy.
And maybe I run into so many people who are hostile because they can't open their minds to the possibilities that sometimes the need to mess with their heads outweighs the millstone of humiliation.
It seems like you were acting very territorial.
- l don't know...
- Of course I was.
In our investigations, you may not always agree with me, but at least you respect the journey.
And if you want to continue working with them, I won't hold it against you.
I don't know.
You must have something more than your polygraph interpretation to back up this bizarre theory and I have to see what it is.
These are Eugene Tooms's prints.
This is the fingerprint they took from Usher's office.
It matches the old ones from the X-Files.
Obviously no match.
What if somehow...
How could that be?
The only thing I know for certain is...
they let him go.
64 inches from the south wall.
Let's check on liver transplants in the next 24 hours.
- Maybe this is black market.
- Come on!
It was ripped outta there.
Look, at this point I'm willing to give any theory a shot!
Any sane theory.
Dana, I only want qualified members of the team at the crime scene.
What's the matter?
You worried I'm going to solve your case?
Tom, we have authorised access to this crime scene.
A report of you obstructing another officer's investigation might stick out on your file.
Look, Dana, whose side are you on?
The victim's.
105 inches from the fireplace.
The victim is a Thomas Werner, single, white... lt's Tooms.
And he took something.
Baltimore PD checked out Tooms's apartment. lt was a cover.
No one has ever lived there and he hasn't shown up for work since the arrest.
I found him.
How do we learn about the present?
We look to the past.
I think this is where it all began in 1903, on Exeter Street.
Look at the address of that first murder in 1903.
Apartment 203.
He killed the guy above him.
Maybe his neighbour played the Victrola too loud.
- This must be Tooms's great-grandfather.
- What about the prints?
Genetics might explain the patterns.
It also might explain the sociopathic attitudes and behaviours.
It begins with one family member who raises an offspring who raises the next child...
What is this?
The Anti-Waltons?
What do you think?
I think we have to track Eugene Tooms.
There's four down and one to go this year.
If we don't get him right now, the next chance will be in... 2023.
You'll be head of the Bureau by then.
You go through the census.
I'll plough through this century's marriage, birth, death certificates and...
Do you have any Dramamine on you?
These things make me seasick.
- Anything?
- Nope.
He disappeared off the face of the earth.
You?
Never was born.
Never married.
Never died.
At least in Baltimore County.
Oh, I did find one thing, though.
It's the current address of the investigating officer of the Powhattan Mill murders in 1933.
I've been waiting 25 years for you.
Sir?
I called it quits in 1968 after 45 years as a cop.
And those killings at Powhattan Mill... I was a sheriff then and I'd seen my share of murders.
Bloody ones.
But I could go home and... pitch a few baseballs to my kid and never give it a second thought.
You gotta be able to do that.
You... you'd go crazy, right?
But those murders in Powhattan Mill...
When I walked into that room, my heart went cold.
My hands... numbed.
I could feel... it!
Feel what, Frank?
When I first heard about the death camps in 1945, I remembered Powhattan Mill.
When I see the Kurds and the Bosnians, that room is there, I tell you.
It's like all the horrible acts that humans are capable of somehow gave birth to some kind of... human monster.
That's why I say I've been waiting for you.
There's a box in the trunk here.
Get it for me, would you, please?
Now, this is all the evidence I've collected.
- Officially and unofficially.
- Unofficially?
I knew that the murders in '63 were by the same... person as in '33.
But by then they had me on a desk pushing papers and they wouldn't let me anywhere near the case.
- A piece of the removed liver?
- Yes.
But, you know, that's not the only trophy he took with him.
Family members reported small personal effects missing in each case.
A hairbrush in the Walters murder.
A coffee mug in the Taylor murder.
Have you ever heard the name Eugene Victor Tooms?
When they wouldn't bring me aboard in '63, I...
I did some of my own work.
I took these surveillance pictures.
This is Tooms.
Of course, that was him 30 years ago.
And this... is the apartment where he lived.
- lt was located at...
- 66 Exeter Street?
Right.
That's it.
Right there.
Here's 103.
The old man was right.
You can feel it.
There's nothing here.
Check this out.
What's down here?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
Just an old coal cellar.
Somebody having a garage sale?
- This is the shape on Werner's mantel.
- Frank said he collected trophies.
- Does he live in here?
- lt looks like the wall's deteriorating.
No.
Somebody made it.
This is a nest.
Look.
It's made out of rags and newspapers.
This looks like the opening.
Think there's anything inside?
Oh, my God, Mulder. lt smells like... I think it's bile.
is there any way I can get it off my fingers quickly without betraying my cool exterior?
- No one could live in this.
- l don't think it's where he lives.
I think it's where he hibernates.
- Hibernates?
- Just listen.
What if some genetic mutation could allow a man to awaken every 30 years?
Mulder...
And what if the five livers could provide him sustenance for that period?
What if Tooms is some kind of 20th century... genetic mutant?
In any case, he's not here now and he's gotta come back.
- We'll need a surveillance team.
- That'll take some finagling.
You go downtown and see what you can finagle and I'll keep watch.
Oh, wait. I'm snagged on something.
Oh, it's OK. I got it.
It's about time.
So... who we looking for again?
Eugene Tooms.
He's unarmed but consider him dangerous.
Scully and I will be back to relieve you in eight hours if he doesn't show.
Right here.
You got it...
Spooky.
We have to talk.
- l have to meet Mulder.
- That's why we have to talk.
You're using two of my men to sit in front of a condemned building!
It isn't interfering with your investigation.
When we had lunch, I looked forward to working with you.
You were a good agent.
But, after Mulder, I couldn't have you far enough away.
Don't go down there.
I had the stakeout called off.
You can't do that!
No, I can't!
But my Regional ASA did it once I told him about the waste in man-hours.
Uh-uh.
Let me call Mulder.
Let me tell him the news.
is this what it takes to climb the ladder, Colton?
All the way to the top.
Then I can't wait till you fall off and land on your ass.
This is Fox Mulder.
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Where is everyone?
Scully?
This is Fox Mulder.
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Mulder, you must have gone out since Colton gave us the night off.
What say we file a complaint against him?
I am furious!
Call me when you get in.
OK, bye.
Dammit!
Dammit, answer!
Scully!
Are you all right?
He's not gonna get his quota this year.
Look at him.
He's building another nest.
You'll be interested to know that I've ordered some genetic tests.
The preliminary medical exam revealed quite abnormal development in the muscular and skeletal systems.
As well as a continually declining metabolic rate.
It dips way below the levels registered in deep sleep.
Did you hear me, Mulder?
All these people putting bars on their windows.
Spending good money on hi-tech security systems trying to feel safe.
I look at this guy and I think... it ain't enough.

They put the time of death between eight and twelve hours ago.
No visible cause, no sign of battery or sexual assault.
All we have is this.
Can we turn her over?
Karen Swenson.
- ls that a positive id?
- She went to school with my son.
Would that be the class of '89?
It's happening again, isn't it?
Agent Dana Scully.
Come in.
Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice.
Please.
- You've been with us just over two years.
- Yes, sir.
You went to medical school but you chose not to practise.
How'd you come to work for the fbi?
Well, sir, I was recruited out of medical school.
My parents still think it was an act of rebellion.
But I saw the fbi as a place where l could distinguish myself.
Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder?
Yes, I am.
- How so?
- By reputation.
He's an Oxford-educated psychologist who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988.
Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crime section.
He had a nickname at the Academy.
Spooky Mulder.
Agent Mulder has developed a consuming devotion to an unassigned project outside the Bureau mainstream.
Are you familiar with the so-called X-Files?
I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena.
More or less.
The reason you're here is we want you to assist Mulder on these X-Files.
You'll write field reports on your activities and your observations on the validity of the work.
Am I to understand that you want me to debunk the X-Files project, sir?
We trust you'll make the proper scientific analysis.
You'll want to contact Agent Mulder.
We look forward to your reports.
Sorry, nobody down here but the fbi's Most Unwanted.
Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully.
I've been assigned to work with you.
Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded!
Who did you tick off to get stuck with this?
Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard a lot about you.
Oh, really?
I was under the impression that you were sent to spy on me.
If you have any doubt about my qualifications or credentials...
You're a medical doctor.
You teach at the Academy.
You did your undergraduate degree in physics.
"Einstein's Twin Paradox:
A New Interpretation.
Dana Scully."
That's a credential, rewriting Einstein.
- Did you bother to read it?
- l did. I liked it.
It's just that in most of my work, the laws of physics rarely seem to apply.
Maybe I can get your medical opinion on this though.
Oregon female, age 21, no explainable cause of death.
Autopsy shows nothing.
Zip.
There are, however, these two distinct marks on her lower back.
Dr Scully, can you lD these marks?
Needle punctures, maybe.
An animal bite.
Electrocution of some kind.
How's your chemistry?
This substance was found in the surrounding tissue.
It's organic.
I don't know.
is it some kind of synthetic protein?
I've never seen it before either.
But here it is again in Sturgis, South Dakota.
And again in Shamrock, Texas.
- Do you have a theory?
- l have plenty of theories.
Maybe what you could explain to me is why it's Bureau policy to label these cases as unexplained phenomena and ignore them.
Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?
Logically, I would have to say no.
Given the distances needed to travel from deep space, the energy requirements would exceed...
Conventional wisdom.
This Oregon female is the 4th person in her graduating class to die under mysterious circumstances.
Now when convention and science offer us no answers, might we not finally turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?
The girl obviously died of something.
If it was natural causes, maybe something was missed in the postmortem.
If she was murdered, it's plausible there was a sloppy investigation.
What I find fantastic is any notion that there are answers beyond the realm of science.
The answers are there.
You just have to know where to look.
That's why they put the "l" in fbi.
See you tomorrow morning, Scully.
Bright and early.
We leave for the very plausible state of Oregon at 8am.
Would all passengers fasten their seat belts as we're about to make...
This must be the place.
You didn't mention yesterday this case has already been investigated.
The fbi got involved after the first three deaths when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence.
Our boys came out here, enjoyed the local salmon, which, with a little lemon twist, is just to die for.
Without explanation they were called back in, the case was reclassified and buried in the X-Files until I dug it up.
And you found something they didn't?
The autopsy reports of the first three victims show no unidentified marks.
But those reports were signed by a different medical examiner than the latest victim.
That's good, Scully.
Better than you expected or better than you hoped?
I'll let you know when we get past the easy part.
is the medical examiner a suspect?
We don't know yet. I've arranged to exhume one of the other victims' bodies to see if we can get a tissue sample to match the girl's.
- You're not squeamish, are you?
- l don't know. I've never had the pleasure.
What's going on?
- What the hell was that about?
- Oh, you know.
Probably nothing.
Mr Mulder, John Truitt, County Coroner's Office.
Yeah, hi.
This is Agent Scully.
How soon can we get started?
- We're ready to go.
- Oh, great!
Were you able to arrange for an examination facility?
- We got something for ya.
- Excuse me!
Excuse me.
No.
Please!
Please stay in the car!
I just don't know who you people think you are.
You think you can come up here and do whatever you please!
I'm sorry.
You are...?
I'm Dr Jay Nemman, County Medical Examiner.
Surely you were told of our intentions?
No.
No, we've been away.
Oh!
Well, that answers a question that we had.
Why you hadn't done the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson.
You're aware of the tissue sample taken from her?
What is the insinuation here?
That I missed something in those other kids?
- We're not insinuating anything, sir.
- Wait a minute!
See, I think you are!
And you'd better have something to back it up.
Daddy, please!
Let's just go home.
Let's go home!
Please!
The guy obviously needed a longer vacation.
Ray Soames was the third victim.
He spent time in a state mental hospital, treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.
Soames confessed to the first two murders but couldn't produce any evidence that he committed the crimes.
Did you read the cause of death?
Exposure.
His body was found in the woods after escaping the hospital.
Missing for only seven hours in July.
How does a 20-year-old boy die of exposure on a warm, summer night in Oregon, Dr Scully?
I got it.
- This isn't official procedure.
- Really?
It's probably a safe bet Ray Soames never made the varsity basketball team.
Seal this up now!
Nobody sees or touches this.
Nobody!
This is amazing!
Do you know what this could mean?
It's almost too big to comprehend.
The subject is 156cms in length, weighing 52lbs in extremis.
Corpse is in advanced stages of decay and desiccation.
Distinguishing features include large ocular cavities.
Oblate cranium indicates subject is not human.
Could you point that flash away from me, please?
If it's not human, what is it?
It's familian.
A chimpanzee or something from the ape family.
Possibly an orang-utan.
Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soames's grave.
Try telling that to Ray Soames's family!
I want tissue samples, X-rays, blood typing, toxicology and a full genetic work-up.
- You're serious?
- What we can't do here, we'll order to go.
You don't honestly believe this is some kind of an extraterrestrial?
- This is somebody's sickjoke.
- We can do those X-rays here?
Can't we do them right now?
I'm not crazy, Scully.
I have the same doubts you do.
Visual inspection of the body and X-ray analysis confirms homologous but possibly mutated mammalian physiology.
However, does not account for small unidentified object found in subject's nasal cavity.
A grey metallic implant...
Who is it?
Steven Spielberg!
I'm going for a run.
You wanna come?
You figure out what was up Ray Soames's nose yet?
No.
And I'm not losing sleep over it.
Good night.
Ray Soames was a patient of mine, yes.
I oversaw his treatment for a year for clinical schizophrenia.
He couldn't grasp reality.
He suffered from some kind of post-traumatic stress.
- Have you seen it before?
- l've treated similar cases.
Were any of those Ray Soames's classmates?
Yes.
We're trying to find a connection in these deaths.
Did you treat any of these kids with hypnosis?
No, I did not.
- Are you treating any of these kids now?
- Currently?
Yes, I'm treating Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell.
Both long-term live-in patients.
- They're here at this hospital?
- That's right.
Going on four years now.
Can we talk to them?
Well, you might find it difficult, certainly in Billy Miles' case.
Billy's experiencing a waking coma.
His brain waves are flat and he's persistent vegetative.
How did it happen?
He and Peggy were involved in an automobile accident on State Road.
Peggy?
We have some visitors.
Would you like to talk with them?
Billy wants me to read now.
- Does he like it when you read to him?
- Yes.
Billy needs me close.
Doctor?
I'm wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam on Peggy.
Peggy, what are you doing?
No one is going to hurt you!
Get an orderly!
Nobody's going to hurt you.
The nurse is here.
It's all right. lt's all right.
Peggy, you're going to be fine.
You've had these nosebleeds before.
Now calm down.
Whatshisname...
Billy said he was sorry he didn't get to say goodbye.
How did you know she'd have the marks?
I don't know.
Lucky guess?
Dammit, Mulder, cut the crap.
What do you know about those marks?
What are they?
Why?
So you can put it in your report?
You're not ready for what I think.
I'm here to solve this case. I want the truth.
The truth?
I think those kids have been abducted.
By who?
By what?
- You don't really believe that?
- Do you have a better explanation?
I'll buy that girl is suffering some kind of pronounced psychosis.
Whether it's organic or the result of those marks, I can't say.
But to say that they've been riding around in flying saucers is crazy!
- There is nothing to support that.
- Nothing scientific.
There has got to be an explanation.
You've got four victims.
All of them died in or near the woods.
They found Karen Swenson's body in the forest in her pyjamas ten miles from her house.
How did she get there?
What were those kids doing out there in the forest?
Mulder?
Mulder, is that you?
Mulder?
Special Agent Dana Scully, fbi.
Drop your weapon.
I'm with the County Sheriff's Department.
- You're trespassing on private property here.
- We are conducting an investigation.
Get in your car and leave!
Or I'll have to arrest you.
I don't care who you are.
Hold on!
This is a crime scene.
Did you hear what I said?
You are on private property without legal permission.
Now I'm only gonna say it one more time - get in your car and leave!
What's he doing out here all by himself?
Maybe it has something to do with this.
What do you think it is?
I don't know.
- ls it a campfire?
- lt was all over the ground.
I think something's going on out here.
Some kind of a sacrifice, maybe.
What if these kids are involved in some kind of a cult and that man knows something about it?
I wanna come back here.
You OK, Mulder?
- Yeah, I'm just...
- What are you looking for?
- What happened?
- We lost power.
Brakes, steering, everything.
We lost nine minutes!
We lost what?
Nine minutes!
I looked at my watch just before the flash, it was 9:03 - itjust turned 9:13.
Look!
Look!
Oh, yes!
Abductees!
People that have sighted UFOs reported unexplained time loss.
- Come on!
- Gone!
Just like that!
No, wait a minute.
You're saying that time disappeared?
Time can'tjust disappear!
It's a universal invariance!
Not in this zip code.
Great!
Hi!
- l want you to look at something.
- Come on in.
What are they?
Mulder, what are they?
Mosquito bites.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I got eaten up alive myself out there.
You OK?
Yes.
- You're shaking.
- l need to sit down.
Take your time.
I was 12 when it happened.
She just disappeared out of her bed one night.
Just gone.
Vanished.
No note.
No phone calls.
No evidence of anything.
You never found her?
It tore the family apart.
No one would talk about it.
There were no facts to confront.
Nothing to offer any hope.
What did you do?
I went off to school in England.
I came back, got recruited by the Bureau.
It seems I had a natural aptitude for applying behavioural models to criminal cases.
My success allowed me a certain freedom to pursue my own interests.
And that's when I came across the X-Files.
By accident?
At first it looked like a garbage dump for UFO sightings, alien abduction reports, the kind of stuff most people laugh at.
But I was fascinated. I read all the cases I could get my hands on.
I read everything about paranormal phenomena, about the occult and...
What?
There's classified government information I've been trying to access but someone has been blocking me.
- Who?
I don't understand.
- Someone at a higher level of power.
I'm allowed to continue my work because I've made connections in Congress.
And they're afraid you'll leak this information?
You're part of that agenda.
You know that.
I'm not a part of any agenda.
You've got to trust me.
I'm here just like you, to solve this.
I'm telling you this, Scully, because you need to know.
Because of what you've seen.
In my research I've worked very closely with a man named Dr Heitz Werber.
He's taken me through deep-regression hypnosis.
I've been able to go into my own repressed memories to the night my sister disappeared.
I can recall a bright light outside and a presence in the room.
I was paralysed, unable to respond to my sister's calls for help.
Listen to me, Scully!
This thing exists.
- But how do you know...
- The government knows about it.
And I gotta know what they're protecting.
Nothing else matters to me.
And this is as close as I've ever gotten to it.
Hello?
What?
!
Who is this?
Who is th...
That was some woman who just said Peggy O'Dell was dead.
The girl in the wheelchair?
- What happened?
- She ran out in front of me.
- Who are you?
- She was running?
On foot?
- That's just...
Let's go!
- We need to ask a few questions.
Someone trashed the lab and they stole the body.
- We're going back to the motel.
- What?
They stole the corpse?
fbi.
There goes my computer!
Dammit!
The X-rays and pictures!
My name is Teresa Nemman.
You've got to protect me!
Come with us.
This is the way it happens.
I don't know how I get out there.
I'll just find myself out in the woods.
- How long has it been happening?
- Ever since the summer we graduated.
It's happened to my friends, too.
That's why I need you to protect me.
I'm scared I might... die, like the others.
Like...
Peggy did tonight.
Your father's the medical examiner.
You were the one on the phone.
You told me Peggy O'Dell had been killed.
Teresa, your father knows about this, doesn't he?
About what happens?
Yes.
But he said never to tell anyone about any of it.
- Why?
- He wants to protect me.
He thinks he can protect me.
But I don't think he can.
Do you have the marks, Teresa?
Yes.
I'm going to die, aren't I?
I'm gonna be next!
No, you're not going to die.
Oh, God!
Let's go home, Teresa.
Teresa, come on.
Come on, honey.
- l don't think she wants to leave.
- l don't care what you think!
She's sick.
Your father wants to take you home.
He'll clean you up.
I'll take you where you'll be safe.
Detective Miles and I won't let anything happen to you.
You're Billy Miles's father?
That's right.
And you stay away from that boy.
Ah, you gotta love this place.
Every day is like Halloween.
They know, Mulder.
They know who's responsible for the murders.
They know something.
Dr Nemman's been hiding medical evidence from the beginning.
He lied on the autopsy.
And now we find out about the detective.
Who else would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms?
Why would they destroy evidence?
What would they want with that corpse?
I don't know.
Makes you wonder what's in those other two graves.
- They're both empty.
- What is going on here?
I think I know who did it.
I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.
Who?
The detective?
The detective's son.
Billy Miles.
The boy in the hospital?
The vegetable?
Billy Miles?
A boy who's been in a coma for four years came here and dug up these graves?
Peggy O'Dell was in a wheelchair but she ran in front of a truck.
Look, it all fits a profile of alien abduction.
This fits a profile?
Peggy O'Dell was killed around nine.
The same time we lost nine minutes.
Something happened then.
I think that time, as we know it, stopped.
And something took control over it.
You think I'm crazy.
What?
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped a couple of minutes after nine.
I made a note of it when I saw the body.
That's why the kids come to the forest.
It controls them. lt summons them.
And the marks are from some kind of tests being done on them.
And that maybe causes some kind of genetic mutation, which explains the body we dug up.
And the force summoned Teresa Nemman's body into the woods tonight.
Yes!
But Billy Miles took her there.
Summoned by some alien impulse.
That's it!
Come on, let's get out of here.
- Where are we going?
- We're gonna visit Billy Miles.
We could be here until the Second Coming waiting for Billy to get out of this bed.
It ain't gonna happen.
He blinks and I know about it.
- l guess you changed his bedpan last night.
- Nobody else here's gonna do it.
You noticed nothing unusual?
Do you remember what you were doing last night around nine o'clock?
Probably... watching TV.
Yeah.
Do you remember what you were watching?
Let's see.
I don't really remember what I watched.
Miss?
What is she looking for?
Mulder, take a look at this.
- Who took care of Peggy last night?
- Not me. lt's not my ward.
Not my aisle of the produce section.
I do have ajob of my own to do.
What is she doing now?
Thank you for your time.
- OK.
- Good day.
That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell!
- Scully...
- lt's crazy!
- He was in the woods!
- You're sure?
This is the same stuff I took a handful of in the forest.
- We should run a test on it.
- We lost the original sample in the fire.
I want you to understand what it is you're saying.
- You said it yourself.
- You have to write it in your report.
You're right.
We'll take another sample from the forest and run a comparison before we do anything.
The detective's here.
What do you think?
You wouldn't listen to me.
I told you to stay out of this.
Hold it!
Hold it right there!
You got no business out here.
- There were screams.
- Down on the ground.
Now!
You know it's Billy.
You've known it all along.
- l said down on the ground.
- How long are you gonna let it happen?
He's gonna kill her!
Billy, no!
Let her go!
Leave her alone!
Dad?
Billy...
Oh, God!
Scully!
- Scully!
- Mulder, what happened?
There was a light... lt was incredible.
If you can hear me, raise your right hand.
Tell me about the light, Billy.
When did you first see the light?
In the forest.
We were all in the forest having a party.
All my friends.
We were celebrating.
- What were you celebrating?
- Graduation.
And then the light came.
It took me away... to the testing place.
They would tell me to gather the others so that they could do tests.
They put something in my head.
Here.
I would wait for their orders.
Billy, who gave the orders?
The light.
They said it would be OK.
No one would know.
But the tests didn't work.
They wanted everything destroyed.
They said they were leaving.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid they're coming back.
Don't be afraid, Billy.
We're here to help you.
What we've just witnessed, what we've read in your field reports, the scientific basis and credibility just seem wholly unsupportable.
- You're aware of that?
- Yes, sir.
My reports are personal and subjective.
I haven't drawn any conclusion about what I've seen.
Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case.
This... time loss.
You did or did not experience it?
I can't substantiate it.
No.
What exactly can you substantiate, Agent Scully?
I see no evidence thatjustifies the legitimacy of these investigations.
There were, of course, crimes committed.
Yes, but how do you prosecute a case like this?
With testimony given under hypnosis from a boy who claims he was given orders from an alien force through an implant in his nose.
You have no physical evidence.
This is the object described by Billy Miles as a communication device.
I removed it from the exhumed body.
I kept it in my pocket. lt was the only piece of evidence not destroyed in the fire.
I ran a lab test on it.
The material could not be identified.
Agent Mulder.
What are his thoughts?
Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.
Thank you, Agent Scully.
That'll be all.
Hello?
Scully, it's me. I haven't been able to sleep.
I talked to the DA's office in Raymon County, Oregon.
There's no case file on Billy Miles.
The paperwork we filed is gone.
We need to talk, Scully.
Yes... tomorrow.

- That's the list, Cor.
- None of these are me, Shawn.
I mean, here I am, going into my eighth year of public education,
- and who am I, really?
- You're you.
You're Cory Matthews.
Yeah, but there's no Cory Matthews club on here, there's no club for ordinary guys who don't know who they are
- and aren't great at anything.
- So start one.
- Oh, I probably wouldn't get in.
- (bell rings)
Cory, you got a lot of good qualities.
- Hey, you're honest, loyal and decent.
- Housebroken, too.
I'm a stinkin' beagle.
All right, people, this just off the wire.
Elections for next year's eighth-grade class president will be held next week.
(as if sneezing) Who cares?
(as if coughing) Detention!
Sorry!
Too many people whine and moan about the way things run around here.
Well, this is a chance to change things by getting involved.
But remember, this is a student election... (students)...it's not a popularity contest.
I think we've been spending a little too much time together.
The point is, your class president doesn't need to be a quarterback or a cheerleader.
You'll be much better off with someone who's honest, loyal and decent.
- Cory, that's you.
- What?
You wanted to know who you were.
You could be president.
- Come on.
- All right, let's have some nominations.
I got somebody good.
I nominate me.
Your humility is impressive, Meese, but someone else has to nominate you.
- Topanga, how about it?
- No, go away, and don't look at me.
Come on, Meese here has the guts to run.
Someone should have the guts to nominate him.
All right, big deal.
I'll nominate him.
What are you doing?
That's your competition.
- I'm not running.
- Anybody else?
The great state of Shawn nominates the people's choice...
Cory Matthews.
- No!
- No!
He's not gonna settle for second-rate leadership.
Matthews, you've been nominated.
Do you accept?
- No way.
- No way would he turn down a chance to serve his fellow students.
What are you, his handler?
- Yes, I am.
- No, he's not.
Look, I don't know anything about being president, OK?
I wouldn't have a clue.
I'm not somebody special.
I'm just an average guy like all of you, the simple, hard-working... students who struggle day after day with too much homework, unfair teachers, and an antiquated justice system that relies too much on detention.
And if elected...
if I win and you guys vote for me...
I would say to each and every one of you, "Hey, thanks!"
(Shawn) You got something, man.
You could really win this.
Yeah, but Shawn, there are like 400 kids in our grade, and I don't even know most of them.
That's why we have to take your message from the lunchrooms to the bathrooms, from the halls to the stalls.
We have to tell everybody who you are!
- But I'm not anybody.
- Say it again.
- I'm not anybody.
- That's what they like.
You're not some handsome, smart, popular guy.
You're not cool.
- You're not even halfway...
- Hey!
I got it.
Thank you.
You're on my side, right?
There is no other side.
I'm gonna put together a campaign like this school has never seen, an unstoppable tidal wave, gathering snow, blazing through the sky, crushing everything in its beak.
You're getting off on this, aren't you?
I gotta say I am.
This is Cory Matthews' campaign commercial, directed by me.
The following is paid for by Citizens to Elect Cory, which so far is... just me.
(Shawn) Action!
Cory Matthews... loyal, honest, decent, a leader who dares to say...
Hey, I'm average.
Why, hello there, young lady.
And what do you think of me?
Hi, Cory.
Tell me how you plan to make this school a more effective institution for the entire student body.
Well, that's a very...
Shawn!
(Shawn) Cut!
Topanga, could you please just read what I wrote out for you?
Yeah, like I'm gonna say, "Cory's cute and cuddly.
That's what's important to me as a girl."
- What?
- This is not how I think.
This is not how any girl thinks.
And there's no "m" in "cuddly."
Topanga, please, Shawn knows what he's doing.
- No.
No, I don't.
- What?
Really.
She's right.
I should have been more sensitive to our female brothers.
Tell you what.
These... these are gone.
I want you to say whatever you think needs to be said as a human being who just happens to be female.
- Apology accepted.
- Before you start, could you wet your lips?
You are so sleazy.
What?
What?
(Shawn) OK.
The idea here is that you and your brother share a common bond - brotherhood.
We want to show that to the voters.
So basically you just want to see me being an older brother.
There you go.
OK, action!
- (Eric) Hey, Cor!
- Hey, there, older brother.
You know, Cor, I was just sitting here thinking, what makes my little brother special?
What sets him apart from the other seventh-grade candidates?
Is it his allergy to scallops?
Eric.
- Is it his Scooby-Doo thermos?
- Where'd you find that?
No, I think it's his fuzzy bunny pajamas with the cottontail.
I haven't worn these for years, I swear.
Boinky, boinky, boinky.
Vote for me!
Vote for me!
- Boinky, boinky, boinky...
- (Shawn) Cut!
Oh!
Hey, guys, whatcha doin'?
- Cut!
- Campaign commercial.
- Is this your script?
- No, no, n...
"It's morning at Cory's house and Cory's having pizza for breakfast.
"Yes, Cory does pretty much whatever he wants.
Why?
Because his parents are dead."
Shawn wrote it.
- Mrs. Matthews, I could lie to you.
- Oh, why stop now?
Our research shows that parents are not thought of as cool, so if we can position Cory as being "on his own," individual, independent, we increase his level of cool.
And, Cor, how cool do you feel about the recent demise of your parents?
It's just temporary, Mom.
I mean, as soon as I'm elected, you and Dad will be found living amongst the bears in the Oregon woods.
OK.
Mr. McGruder, I don't care to hear what your little brother tore up or what your dog ate.
I want your paper on my desk by first bell tomorrow or else.
- You'll give me an F.
- I'll give you a G.
As in, "Gee, if I'd just done my work on time,
I wouldn't be the only 40-year-old in the 7th grade."
Ta-ta.
- He's not human.
- You want him gone?
- Can you do that?
- Cory can.
If he's elected, Feeny's gone.
You can do that?
If that's what you want, that's what Cory will do.
Spread the word.
Shawn, I want to win too, but in what part of your diseased mind does the eighth-grade class president get to fire the principal?
Cory, come on.
It's just a campaign promise.
It's what you say to get elected.
Now, repeat after me.
Give the people what they want.
Yeah, but I...
Give the people what they want... (mumbles) Give the people what they want.
And if teachers get paid for teaching, then students should get paid for learning.
(all) Yeah!
And this homework thing...
what is that about?
If they can't teach enough during school hours,
- why is that our problem?
- (all) Yeah!
- This guy may be cheesier than we are.
- What do we do?
We break out the heavy cheese.
Let me tell you something, my friends.
How can you believe anything this guy says?
He's got straight A's.
He's been making you look dumb for years.
Can you really trust this...
this curve breaker?
- Curve breaker!
- (all) Curve breaker!
Curve breaker!
Curve breaker!
Curve...!
Talk to 'em, Cory.
Tell 'em what they want to hear.
Curve breaker!
Curve breaker!
My fellow students, there are many challenging issues which currently face John Adams High, issues that seemingly have no solutions...
And I say there'd be fewer problems if we spent less time here.
I mean, what's the deal with this five-day school week?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm pretty much shot by Wednesday, so let's end the week there.
If I'm president, Thursdays and Fridays are part of the weekend.
(all) Yeah!
- Mondays are optional.
- Yeah!
- Tuesdays, come in prepared to learn.
- Yeah!
We are the future!
Hey, you can't make five-day weekends.
Yeah, well, you can't pay kids for going to school.
- Are you questioning my integrity?
- Yeah, we are.
Well, I question yours, and I have proof.
Nobody move.
Shawn, he doesn't have anything on us, does he?
No, it's a bluff.
It's gotta be.
Listen, man, a lot of weird stuff goes on in the trailer park.
When do you step in and teach them the democratic process?
If Matthews wins, Tuesday.
Mr. Turner, all I'm hearing from your little election are ridiculous promises and character assassination.
Too much like the real thing, George?
Yes, but don't we aspire for their generation to do better?
Yeah, we do.
But we can't just tell them what to do.
They have to learn for themselves.
So you believe in letting them make their own mistakes?
Yeah, I do.
I don't think that's a bad way to go.
Nor I. In fact, I have that philosophy toward a certain young teacher that I know.
What, you mean me?
Voters and voterettes, this poor, exploited young woman is named Paula, and she has a sordid story to tell.
Go ahead, Paula.
Tell them what you told me.
I was in third grade with Shawn Hunter.
One day, he and I were standing near the monkey bars, and...
I can't go on.
Go ahead, Paula.
Be strong.
Well, Shawn said that...
that all girls...
- ...were icky!
- (students gasp)
Oh, God, come on.
I never said that.
You wrote it on my notebook.
"All girls are icky."
Give me a break.
I was only eight.
I didn't like girls then, but I love them now.
- So you changed your mind?
- Of course.
- Flip-flop.
- What?
Flip-flop.
He changes his mind about girls.
Who knows what he's gonna change his mind about next?
- Flip-flopper.
- (students) Flip-flopper!
Flip-flopper!
- (all) Flip-flopper...
- Wait a minute!
Wait, wait, wait.
Shawn's not even running here.
- But he represents you, doesn't he?
- I sure do.
Then Cory, are you prepared to drop out of the race?
- No.
- Are you prepared to drop your flip-flopping one-time sexist campaign manager?
All I want is justice.
Shawn has to go.
- Shawn must go!
- (students) Shawn must go!
- (all) Shawn must go!
- Wait a minute.
Don't you guys want a president who's loyal to his friends 1000 percent?
(all) No!
- Really?
That's what you guys want?
- (all) Yes!
Then Shawn is out.
Yeah!
(students cheer)
How could you do this to me?
Did you hear them cheer, Shawn?
I think we picked up a lot of girl votes.
You said we were weak on girls.
Cory, you fired me.
- Well, yeah, just a little.
- No.
No, no, it was all of me.
But I had to.
We're in this to win, right?
"We"?
"We"?
- Shawn, you're squealing.
- Yeah, I'm squealing.
That's the sound you make when your best friend takes a gun and stabs you in the back right in front of your eyes.
Look, I just did what you told me to.
I gave the people what they wanted.
- Well, I want my campaign back.
- Yeah, since when was it your campaign?
Only since I nominated you and told you what to say every step of the way.
You were helpful in the early going, and I'll never forget that.
You fired me.
Shawn, my friend, this is not a time for bitterness.
This is a time for healing.
You know what, Cory Matthews?
If I met you just this minute,
I wouldn't know who you are.
I'm Cory Matthews, the next president of the eighth grade.
Not without me, pal.
So how's the campaign?
We're just reevaluating, you know, considering a new direction.
Mm-hmm.
And that would be down?
Look, Shawn was just holding me back.
Yeah, you're right.
It's probably a good move to dump your best friend for a dopey class election you're gonna lose anyway.
You know what?
You're jealous, huh?
You're used to being the big man...
Mr. Rugby Shirt, Mr. Good Hair, Mr. Dimples.
Oh, stop.
Stop.
When I'm president, people are gonna look at you, and you know what they're gonna say?
Who's sitting next to Cory?
Who's that giving Cory the ride home?
Who's the guy with photos of little Cory running naked through the sprinkler?
Eric, big deal.
I was four.
You were 12.
It was refreshing.
Cory, it's late.
What are you doing up?
I'm just working on my speech for tomorrow's debate.
- Hey, Cor?
- Yeah?
How are you gonna get 'em to shoot Baywatch at your school?
- Well, we have a pool.
- No, you don't.
Keep reading.
Ah.
Oh, and a water slide.
Oh, nice touch.
What are you gonna call it?
Raging Promises?
Dad, it's just to get elected.
Once I win, then I'll do the real stuff... clean up the graffiti, get better food in the cafeteria, just be an all-around voice for the students.
That sounds pretty good.
Why don't you put some of that in here?
Because it's boring, and nobody votes for boring.
They want to hear what you're gonna give 'em.
Even if that's not really what you're gonna give 'em?
Dad, you don't sound like you're behind me on this.
Cory, I'm always behind you.
I'm just not sure I'm behind what you're saying here.
I'm just trying to win.
- Why is that so important?
- So I can be president.
- Why do you want to be president?
- Because then I'll finally fit in and be the person I want to be.
Who do you want to be?
Cory Matthews...
honest, loyal, decent.
Honest to the voters, loyal to your best friend, and decent enough to kill off your parents.
After this morning's debate, you will return to your homerooms and cast your votes for eighth-grade class president.
Now, the candidates.
Alvin W. Meese.
- (cheering) - (boys) Alvin!
Alvin!
And Cory A. Matthews.
(cheering)
Slim pickin's indeed.
We will now hear opening statements.
- Slight change of plans.
- You said I could be moderator.
Well, now there's even more to moderate.
Oh.
All right.
Technically we never closed the nomination process, and so, as of just now, there's a new candidate for president.
Oh, good.
Perhaps a serious-minded student appalled by the tawdry level of the campaign thus far.
- Shawn Hunter.
- (cheers and applause)
I quit.
How you doing?
Vote for me.
Vote for me.
Shawn, what are you doing?
What I should have done in the first place - run for president myself.
Can he do this?
Mr. Turner, this is your little experiment in democracy.
- Can he do this?
- I don't see why not.
Democracy is always invigorated by the infusion of fresh, new ideas.
Do you have any ideas, Mr. Hunter?
Oh, yeah.
Big honkin' ones.
"Big honkin' ones."
So, flip-flopper, call any girls "icky" lately?
Thank you for bringing that up, Alvin.
Yes, I...
I have made some mistakes in the past.
I have called some girls icky, but that was a long time ago, when I had cooties.
That's right.
That's right.
I, Shawn Hunter, had cooties, but I fought my way back, and I stand before you today cootie-free and girl-friendly.
And to prove that, I'd like to introduce to you my co-candidate for president...
Paula Kelly.
(boy hoots)
- Aww.
- Can he do this?
- Can he do this?
- I don't see why not.
- Democracy is always--
- Oh, be quiet.
How far are you willing to let this go?
I have faith in these students and the electoral process, and...
maybe just another minute.
Shawn Hunter's only in this race so he can get back at me for firing him.
And you're only in it because you didn't know who you were.
Well, I know who I am now.
I'm Cory Matthews, man of the people.
OK, man of the people, didn't you lie to the people?
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Didn't you make them outrageous campaign promises you knew you couldn't possibly deliver?
Yeah, only 'cause you told me to.
If I told you to jump off a bridge, would you listen to me?
Yeah, I did that one time.
Don't you remember?
How can you vote for a guy who's dumb enough to jump off a bridge?
It was a miniature golf bridge.
He jumped in to get my ball, and don't call my friend dumb.
Yeah, there's no room in this campaign for name-calling, you four-eyed, frog-voiced geek.
My mother does not buy my clothes.
I resign.
- (boy) Hey, nice outfit!
- (cheers and applause)
Order.
Order!
This has all gone far enough.
Go back to your classrooms and cast your votes for the remaining candidates, and may God have mercy on your souls.
Wait a minute, Mr. Feeny.
Before they vote, shouldn't they hear what we have to say?
No.
Look, I just want to say that before this election,
I really didn't know who I was or what was important to me, but now, weeks later, after looking deeply into my soul,
I still have no idea.
I know less than he knows.
Thank you, Mr. Lincoln, but wait your turn.
So I ran for president to find out who I was, and what I think I'm finding out is that...
I'm not a good candidate or a good friend.
So I withdraw from the race, and I think everyone here should vote for Shawn.
He's really the best friend you could have.
No, I'm not.
I'm worse than you.
I made up every lie he told.
I've known Cory all my life, and he really is honest, loyal and decent.
That's what you are, Cor.
That's all you need to be.
I withdraw from the race, too.
Well, Mr. Feeny, we're both out.
Yes, well, I'm sure you'll do well in the private sector.
Wait a second.
I wanted to be president.
I wanted my life to mean something.
- You want to go grab a burger?
- I'm out.
Well, Mr. Turner, your little experiment in democracy has left the eighth grade leaderless for next year.
Too bad.
I was looking forward to Matthews' five-day weekend.
OK, folks, that's our show.
Thank you for coming.
We now return you to your regular Friday schedule.
Wait a minute.
Our class needs a leader.
And if we ignore all our problems, they're not just going to... go away.
There's graffiti all over the walls, and those old social studies books?
When are they gonna replace those?
And how about some better food in the cafeteria?
(cheering)
And if elected, I will be a voice for the entire student body.
She's got my vote.
You know, she would make a great president.
Yeah, I knew it would all work out.
- Do you realize how lucky you are?
- Yes, sir.
Very lucky.
What we really need is someone who will work hard to make small but real changes that will make a meaningful difference in our daily lives.
Honest, loyal, decent...
- What about a water slide?
- You got it.
- And the power means nothing to her.
- (Topanga) Topanga!
(students) Topanga!
Topanga!
Topanga!
Topanga!
- Topanga!
Topanga!
- (chanting continues)
Cory seemed pretty quiet during dinner.
Yeah, at least we didn't have to listen to any campaign promises.
Poor little guy.
He would have made such a cute president.
I think he's better off.
- I'm kind of proud of him for dropping out.
- I didn't know he dropped out.
Made a bunch of promises he couldn't keep, and it finally caught up to him.
Good lesson to be learned.
You cannot make promises like that.
People remember.
Yeah, like when you promised to take me to Europe.
Exactly.
Do you remember when you said that?
Yes, I do.
I remember we were, um...
- sitting at that place...
- That's right.
We were drinking that wine and eating all those strawberries, and you said, "Sweetheart, one day I'm going to take you to Paris, I promise."
And that's a promise I'm gonna keep.
This summer.
Paris.
You can book the tickets.
Ohh, Alan.
Paris.
You and me, babe.
Mom, did Dad really promise to take you to Paris?
Of course he did... just now.
It's the end of floor finishing week on Tool Time.
- We got a big finish for you.
- That's right.
We're gonna shoot Al out of a giant glue gun.
He'll be everywhere.
- lt's gonna be a great show so stay tuned.
- We're going to finish finishing our floor.
If you said "finish finishing" like that in Finland, you'd be finished already.
Now, if you want a strong waterproof finish, you can't go wrong with polyurethane.
We've already applied one coat with our lamb's-wool applicator.
If your hardware store doesn't stock one, don't fret.
You just duct tape your pet lamb to a pole.
(sound eect of sheep bleating)
For best results, you wanna use two coats.
However, before applying the second one, scuff the first coat with a fiberglass screen to help the second coat adhere better.
Easy to install - set it underneath your buffer and start buffing.
Al uses one of these to buff his legs before he waxes 'em.
Now, speaking of wax - for a gentler, smoother shine, I suggest going with wax.
Of course... (sueaking)
With all the wax I got in there, you could wax a whole basketball court.
Remind me not to shake your hand at the end of the show.
I'm ready to buff out my wax and show you the difference, but Al's using the buffer, so I've brought my own.
Heidi and Stumpy, could you bring out my buffer, please?
Here you go, Tim.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you, Stump.
Could you have built a bigger buffer?
I didn't build this. I bought this at Bob's Big and Tall Appliance Shop.
I'm ready to buff this up.
Watch the shine.
Klaus, music.
(# "Hungarian Dance No " by Brahms)
Perfect.
- Wanna taste my Alfredo sauce?
- lf l taste it now, can I skip it at dinner?
Forget it, I'll taste it myself.
Hi.
Alfredo face.
Hey.
No, no.
- Bet you can't guess where l came from.
- Art museum?
Slippery Steve's Snowmobiles.
He doesn't generally rent, but for me he'll make an exception.
It is so great to be married to a man with that kind of power.
But I must learn to use my power for good, not evil.
- And the good would be?
- A snowmobile party for Randy's birthday.
Dad, I don't know about a snowmobile party.
Come on, think about it.
There's no better way to say happy birthday than saying it at 85 miles an hour, blistering across the tundra, icicles frozen to your face.
"l can't see anything!"
As good as that sounds, I was thinking about a boy-girl party in the basement.
- Girls love snowmobiles.
- What girls?
Snowmobile chicks.
Tim, nobody has their first boy-girl party on a snowmobile.
- l did.
- Nobody normal.
At my first boy-girl party, all the girls wore frilly little dresses.
The boys wore suits and ties.
We played charades and telephone.
Mom, things have changed in the last 1 00 years.
(noisemaker blows) # ...dee, wo-i-dee
# Wo-ee
# Wo-ee

# Wo-ee
Wilson, are you naked?
No, Tim, I'm wearing a hat.
Why are you naked?
Well, Tim, in Finland, they believe that to rejuvenate the body and the soul, you take a hot sauna bath and you follow that with an ice-cold snow massage.
What do they follow that up with?
A heart attack?
No, Tim.
Actually, it's quite invigorating.
Maybe you'd like to join me for a hot sauna sometime.
There's always room for two under my dome.
No, thanks, Wilson. I'm not much of a "get naked with your neighbor" kind of guy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So how did things go over at the snowmobile place?
Steve said he'd rent me the snowmobiles, but Randy'd rather have a boy-girl party.
Well, you don't sound too happy about that.
What's there for me to do at a boy-girl party?
Why do you feel you have to do anything?
'Cause I like getting involved in my boys' birthdays. I had...
Are you still naked?
No, no, no, no.
I'm all covered up.
For Brad's 1 3th birthday, we went to a tractor pull.
And we got mud all over our heads.
I was hoping that Randy's birthday would be just as memorable.
Maybe you should do something different to participate in Randy's celebration.
As the English author Samuel Johnson said:
"Our brightest blazes of gladness are commonly kindled by unexpected sparks."
If anyone knows about unexpected sparks, it'd be me.
You'd be more fulfilled if you did something for Randy that was both unique and unexpected.
- Like what?
- lf l knew that, it wouldn't be unexpected.
Wait.
But unexpected, you're saying...
- Know what's really unexpected?
- What?
The position of that tattoo.
Tim, that's no tattoo.
I just sat on a live coal.
Whoo!
I'm supposed to go to Jimmy's for a sleepover.
We're almost done.
Let me see that wax.
You already put on 1 6 coats.
Why do you have to put on so much?
It's Randy's present.
I want the dance floor perfect.
- Can I try the polisher?
- l'll show you in a minute.
You gotta adjust this by hand.
I'm good. I can do it while it moves, but you gotta be good at it.
So if you get your cuff caught in there...
- So how do I look?
- What's different?
I changed shoes.
Randy, what are you so nervous about?
Well, there's this girl Michelle coming to the party.
Randy, Michelle's not gonna care about what pair of shoes you're wearing.
All she's gonna care about is she gets to have fun at the party.
And she doesn't want any nerdy parents hanging around.
Great news.
Guess what I found in the closet.
My old 45s.
You're gonna let us have guns at the party?
These are records.
This is the music I used to listen to at my parties.
Oh, this can't be good.
"Hurdy Gurdy Man" by Donovan.
Oh.
This is a great slow song.
"To Sir With Love" by Lulu.
Lulu?
Don't worry about it.
There's not a machine in the city that'll play those.
Not true. I found my old Princess record player in the closet too.
All I have to do now is find a needle for it.
Hey, why don't you just hop into your time machine?
(doorbell rings)
Whoa.
Big moment, Randy.
Your first boy or girl at your first boy-girl party.
- Mom.
- (Jill giggles)
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hi, Randy.
The person who followed me in is my father.
- l'm Bert Sanford.
- l'm so happy to meet you. I'm Jill Taylor.
OK, Dad.
You've met his mother and you can see that she looks basically normal.
- You can go now.
- Um, listen.
I can assure you my husband and I will supervise the whole time.
We're very responsible people.
I'll be right back, Mark.
There's my husband now.
Tim.
Come and meet Michelle's father.
Oh, hi, Michelle's father.
Good to see you.
Tim, don't be rude.
Come and shake his hand.
- Not a good time, honey.
- Wait a minute.
Aren't you the guy on that tool show?
Yes, I am.
I love that episode where you lit your sleeve on fire.
Classic episode. I got that thing on tape.
If you wanna watch it, I got it.
You're wondering why I don't have any pants on, aren't you?
- Why's your father in his underwear?
- To ruin my life.
I switched from brief to boxers because they're more freeing when you're in slacks.
I'm gonna go and get a pair of Sansabelts on now.
You guys just hold still while I get some slacks on. I'll be right back.
Why don't you ask Michelle to dance?
I just ate.
You're supposed to wait an hour before you go dancing.
- That's swimming.
- Right. lt's two hours before dancing.
Get over there.
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hi.
So are you having a good time?
Not really.
Well, neither am I.
I'd leave, but this is my house.
I like your shoes.
I like your ears.
What?
I mean, I just never noticed 'em at school before.
I always bring them with me.
Yeah, it's just usually you wear your hair down and you can't see 'em.
But now you can and they really match your nose.
Thanks.
I'm really glad your father let you stay.
I'm really glad your father put some pants on.
Oh!
How come no one's dancing?
This floor isn't just for looking at.
Come on.
Hey, Sherman.
What do you think of the dance floor?
I made this for Randy.
Did your dad ever make you a dance floor?
No. I kept dropping hints, but all I got was a crummy CD player.
Dad, I thought you told me you'd stay upstairs.
I thought I'd come down and help get the party going.
A little dancing.
Everybody, come on.
Baby circles.
I'm the king.
No one ever gave me nothing.
Shut up!
Whoo!
Dad.
Dad.
You're killing me here.
Could you go upstairs, please?
Yeah, all right.
So, Michelle, do you wanna...
- Dance?
- Yeah, sure.
Thanks for asking.
I'm so proud.
That's my floor, right there.
- Michelle, are you OK?
- l don't think so.
Give me a hand.
Are you all right?
# To sir
# With love
- l think she should go to the doctor.
- l'm not sick. I'm just singing.
Sit here.
I'm really sorry about this, Michelle.
What did you do?
Tim!
I might have put a smidge too much wax on the dance floor.
A smidge?
You could hold ice Capades on that thing.
- Speaking of which, we need some ice.
- Well, I just put it all in the punch.
- Yeah?
That's easy.
- No.
Come on.
She's gotta stick her foot in there.
Go ahead, put it in there.
It's freezing.
Cold stops the swelling.
Tomorrow you gotta put heat on there.
Yeah, come back and we'll stick your foot in a tub of hot chocolate.
- We'd better call her parents.
- What's your number?
Oh, no one's home.
My mom's out of town and my dad's buying a new car.
We need someone to call...
What kind?
- Dad.
- My ankle really hurts.
Oh, look, it's turning purple.
Whoa.
Oh, great.
This place is packed.
It's busier than usual.
You should have had the party in here.
It's bad enough you might have broken her ankle.
Don't make her listen to your jokes.
Just watch her, will you?
I'll see if I can move things along.
Don't touch him.
- Hey, Marge.
- Hey, Tim. I see your eyebrows grew back.
Well, they always do.
And they're bushier.
They're thicker this time.
Your wife called about a girl with an injured ankle.
It's Randy's birthday party and she slipped on the dance floor.
Kids.
Slipped on the dance floor?
Let me guess - you overwaxed.
- You know me too well, Marge.
- l see you more than my own husband.
Since I'm such a good customer, you think I could move them to the head of the line?
I wish I could help you out, Tim, but Dr. Harris is on tonight and you know what a stickler for the rules he is.
- Dr. Howie Harris?
- Uh-huh.
He owes me one. I inspired that paper he did on odd head injuries.
Well, you can try to talk to him.
He's in examining room two.
Be sure to knock first.
I'm gonna talk the doctor into moving you ahead of these people.
Except you, pal.
It's all right.
Don't touch him.
I'm sorry your party bombed out.
- l'm sorry you hurt your ankle.
- Me too.
When my dad finds out about this, I'll never be able to go to another party again.
Well, maybe we can hang out together, 'cause I'll never be invited to another party.
I'd like to hang out with you.
- You would?
- Yeah.
But my dad probably won't let me when he finds out I got hurt on your dad's floor.
- Great.
- Marge.
Great news.
We can go right now.
OK.
Come with me, honey.
All right. I'll come back there and check on you in a minute.
Thank you, Marge.
She's gonna be just fine.
They're good here.
Some birthday, huh?
It's the birthday I always dreamed of - sitting with bleeding, infected people.
Hey, the day's not over.
Maybe we can salvage it yet.
No.
There's no way you can salvage this one, Dad.
I finally find out Michelle likes me and now her dad won't let me hang out with her.
Let me talk to him.
He likes Tool Time.
He'll understand accidents happen.
- Hey, Tool Man.
- Hey, Bob.
Hey, Bob.
When you put a shine on a floor like this, how many coats of wax do you use?
1 6?
One.
Only an idiot would do more than that.
(doorbell rings)
Oh, Mr. Sanford, you're early.
After seeing your husband in his underwear and your neighbor wandering around naked, I was a little concerned.
But it seems like everything's under control here.
Here?
Right here?
Yeah, everything's really under control.
- Want some cake?
- No, but I will take some punch.
You...
Mm. it's really very different.
Make it yourself?
Michelle helped.
It tastes like she had a hand in it.
Close.
- Where is Michelle?
- Michelle?
My daughter.
Well, the truth is, she's had a little accident.
- Accident?
- No, she's OK.
- She's at the emergency room...
- Emergency room?
- See?
Look, there she is.
She's fine.
- Hi.
- Sweetheart, are you all right?
- l'm fine. lt's just a sprain.
It's a mild sprain.
She should be OK in a couple of days.
- How did this happen?
- lt's the same old story, you know.
Guy builds dance floor for son, guy overwaxes, girl slips and hurts herself, guy feels terrible, girl's father forgives guy.
- Afraid not.
- l'm sorry, that's how the story goes.
Look, Mr. Sanford, it was just an accident.
Like on Tool Time, the show you like - accidents.
I like when the accidents happen to you, not to my daughter.
Real smooth, Dad.
I should've followed my instincts.
I shouldn't have let you stay.
- Dad, I'm fine.
- l should have taken you car shopping.
What kind of car did you end up with?
Gremlin?
An AMC General?
Maybe a Hornet?
No.
For your information, I collect muscle cars.
- You?
- Yeah.
What I'm really looking for is a '70 GTO.
- (grunts) Yeah!
With a big block?
- Of course with a big block.
And I'd love to find a convertible.
(grunts) Oh, yeah.
- You're a car guy?
- Yeah.
I like to take old pieces of junk and restore 'em to cherry.
Honey, I think I'm in love.
I won't stand in your way.
I got a '46 Ford convertible I'm trying to retrofit into a hot rod.
- You've got a '46 Ford convertible?
- l do.
Wanna see?
- l do.
- l now pronounce you man and car guy.
You want a classic goat - go with the '69 Judge.
Hard to find, but a great investment.
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, would you like to have some cake?
- Yeah.
- Sure.
Randy, I am so sorry that your birthday worked out this way.
If you want, your father and I can make it up to you by taking you and a bunch of your friends to some kind of concert next weekend.
- Why?
is Lulu doing a world tour?
- Ha-ha-ha.
That floor's not too slippery.
Just how I like it.
(music plays)
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Watch out.
Faster.
Yeah!
Come on!
Perfect.
So shiny you can see yourself in it.
Take a look, Al.
Whoa!
What kind of wax did you use on that?
Wash-and-werewolf.
Werewolf?
There wolf.
(howls)
Hi, there!
Thanks.
Let's have a kiss, Happy.
OK...
- Who likes to be the first customer?
- I'm first...
Settle among yourselves.
I'm first...
Turn around, beautiful.
It stinks!
Boss, all the flies here will be extinct.
Why?
Killing flies will be our pastime.
Our neighbour will wind-up soon.
Over a hundred dollars for a cut!
And no shaving!
No massage, no ear-cleaning.
Only pigheaded ones patronize that salon.
It's real classy.
It's ruined!
Do it again.
OK.
Here you are, sir.
Back up 5 feet, at once!
Here is where you want.
Do as I say, 5 feet no more, no less.
Nut!
That's incredible.
Please take it back.
- You are a sage beyond this world?
- Yes?
Where is your consulting office?
What's your title?
I need your sage advice?
I'm Puddin Lai, 18th generation of Soothsayer Lai.
If our lines cross, they cross, if not, you loss.
When we cross again, I'll give you advice,
To get away from misfortune.
Sir, why you can't avert this.
I leaked heaven's secret for you.
I suffered for your sake.
- Really?
- Of course.
Thank you, sage.
- Sage Lai.
- Sage Lai, thank you.
I can smell something evil.
Something devilish lurks this direction.
Let me charge, charge, charge.
I cut.
Give a hand.
- Charge.
- Cut, cut, cut.
Hold it, Count me out in this game.
Charge your ass.
Excuse me.
Happy
Look at your hair, what gel do you use?
It's OK.
The barber next door is devilish!
You know!
Luckily I got through unscathed.
To-day, I averted two misfortunes.
Good Luck.
Oh!
Heavens!
- What is it?
- What?
The third misfortune.
- What date is it?
- The 9th.
Do my hair.
It's the third misfortune.
No on me, but on Big Eye Boy.
Congratulations!
Grand opening, good business, big money rolling in.
Congratulations!
Sorry, wrong blessings.
No, blessing here, oh, no.
No.
No... here as well, everywhere as well.
In short, good business, big money.
Congratulations!
Skilful hands.
Don't you.
I'm not playing.
No playing!
You did it purposely.
Not purposely.
That means playing.
Shave one eye-brow.
Shoot.
Come to us, Big Eye Boy.
Papa.
Not me, He's Papa,
How you become like this?
Why quarrel with these people?
Your godfather becomes one eye-brow hero.
Your Papa never bows to force.
My righteous heart yearns for vengeance.
Watch my revenge.
Bravo.
That's great!
Bravo.
No dead!
What are you guys looking at?
Lustful eyes.
Go inside, Ah Ying.
I'm not through with you yet.
Nothing to see!
Go inside.
So pure and fresh!
Fresh!
Her eyebrows, nose and forehead... are auspicious.
Ah Ying, I'll marry you for sure!
Ying, let me apologize to you.
Let me say sorry for them.
What do the gods say...
Will he be alright?
Doomed!
He's really wretched.
This is my year for romance.
Sure win!
You're spoiled our neighborhood.
You are the culprit,
You should be the one to settle this.
Go and apologize right now.
You know what my instinct tells me?
What?
Don't go.
Go fix it, even if you have to pay indemnity.
- Money!
- Why not.
May be Ah Ying will be moved by your sincerity.
Moved by me?
Sure.
It is my mistake; not yours.
I should shoulder up this.
Right.
Go right away.
May God be with you.
The gods look after you.
I pray to you, gods.
Hi, Uncles,
what I mean is...
It's an early closure.
No, no, I don't mean that.
Uncle, I come to apologize to you.
- Uncle.
- Papa.
Papa, please don't.
For 19 years, your Papa never make one wrong.
Shave, not one hair, until today.
Look.
Shave two eyebrows to pay for mine.
What!
Two!
Uncle, instead of eyebrow, better shave my beard.
Or save you the trouble, I pay you money.
Thanks.
How much?
One Hundred.
Five Hundred, for each of you.
Not one cent less, or else...
Papa, no...
Better run.
I'll make-up for you.
Oh, it looks distorted.
No, it links better than the real one.
Excellent work.
Takes him so long, he is dome for.
Probably comes out castrated.
He has guts but no wit.
He shouldn't flirt with girls.
He should realise his weakness.
How come...
Can't believe my eyes.
Bye-bye.
Be careful!
He looks different.
Yes, what is it?
Much taller.
Ah!
Taller.
How about this style for your semi-final contest?
You like this Omega style?
Good, good.
It is this one then.
It's good for Mummy.
Go got her.
Ying, take a rest.
Have some refreshments.
Mum, don't disrupt us.
It's not up to 30 minutes yet.
You want her to die exhausted.
I say, take a rest.
Don't you want her to become Miss Hong Kong.
The prize is one million dollars.
Moreover, she can marry a rich guy.
Papa, what is important for my husband is:
I love him and he loves me;
Not necessarily a rich guy.
Right, greedy man!
Don't you use Ying to make money.
Woman's mentality.
- Welcome.
- Yes.
Sir, please.
Smelly bean curds.
What's up?
Come!
On the house.
Uncle!
I'm sure you like this.
You too.
Have some chilli sauce.
Help yourself.
This is the most smelly.
Uncle, I've come to apologize... and have shampoo.
So as to hear from you.
Don't hurry.
Help yourself.
Ying, try one.
No, thank you.
Oh, you don't like it.
Shampoo, this way.
Is... she... coming...
I'm honored, you do it yourself.
Ah Fu.
It's yours.
Shampoo?
Your hand!
Come align.
That way.
Ah Ying.
Go, go.
Uncle,
I present you this Fortune Tiger.
It's will bring you big money.
Is my business bad now?
Your business is surely brisk.
But money is never too much, right?
Where shall we place this Fortune Tiger?
This is a vantage point.
Good for money.
Son, here is good for money, no good for sex.
Uncle, you have good sense of humor.
In fact, I come to apologize.
And have a shampoo as well.
Shampoo over there, pay here.
Shampoo?
Make-up eyebrow.
Make-up eyebrow.
Uncle, Ying, these flowers are for...
I like flowers.
Specially for you, Uncle.
- Ying...
- Don't you want a shampoo?
Go.
Don't touch my thing.
I'll have a shampoo first.
Let's go.
- Are your place of work nearby?
- Yes.
- Trust off-duty?
- Yes.
Of course off-duty, it is so late.
Why don't you patronize Grassy Salon next door?
Don't mention the Grassy Salon, Uncle.
It's a mess.
They pull and pluck your hair.
- You lost many hair in 1 shampoo.
- Really?
- Uncle, it is true.
- Really?
- Many people say so.
- Is it?
Bull shit.
Your friend seems quite exaggerating.
He is always like that.
Always boast and brag.
What?
But, this time he speaks the truth.
I know, I know.
Don't you move, are you a baby.
You talk foul behind you friend's back.
Not unethical, just face the facts.
Grassy, what a lousy name.
Talk of skill, can't compare with your Shanghai.
- You agree?
- Of course.
Uncle when you see our hair-dresser friend.
Ask him which is better:
Grassy or Shanghai?
He'll surely say:
Shanghai.
Shut up!
You pigs!
Rats!
So, there you are!
Good!
Now, be honest;
Is Shanghai better than Grassy?
- Is it?
- Dare you say "No"!
No no...
I mean yes.
You see!
Uncle.
You see I was right.
Sit down.
Well, since you three are so appreciative,
I myself will make the hairdo for you.
So nice, Uncle.
Thank you, Ying.
Hey, no entry.
You!
Ungrateful pig!
You, unthankful rat.
Get lost!
Cool it!
Just let us in as customers.
Alright?
Don't take it so serious.
Just now we were joking.
Right.
You should take jokes lightly.
- Why make jokes!
- Don't take so serious.
What a hairdo!
Get inside.
You look grotesque.
Is the Shanghai barber misinforming you.
Not a trace of Ah Ying.
I gave the barber 100 bucks, he was so happy.
Is it false information.
No!
I dreamed of auspicious signs last night.
I am sure of romance...
Ah Ying.
- Ah Ying...
- What a coincidence...
- It's your Shanghai barber...
- No, it is our stars.
Ying, are they your relatives?
No, they are pupils of my class.
I coach them swimming during holidays.
- Let's warm up.
- Good.
Please teach us.
- Let's have fun together.
- Good.
One, two, three...
Look, they're doing it all wrong.
They just stare at the teacher.
Who knows what they're thinking.
I know what you are thinking.
You do?
You want to "Dab" Ah Ying.
What do you mean "Dab"?
"Dab" means say hello to her.
- Is that right?
- Yes...
Thanks, I got it.
- They're cheating the teacher again.
- Yes.
Students...
Let's practise breathing now.
Good...
Miss, I don't know how to breathe.
Alright, I'll teach you.
Let me do it for you.
Hi, kid.
This guy doesn't know how to breathe.
- That's it.
- It's simple.
I can hold one breath for an hour.
Just half an hour!
For one breath,
I can swim across the harbour.
- Liar.
- Don't cheat a child.
- Right.
- It's all talk and no action.
Right.
Can you do it?
Why not!
Go ahead.
Let's test our endurance.
Let's see who will die of exhaustion.
We will have a race.
Children, you'll be our judges.
Good!
OK!
Ying, you be umpire.
Alright, let us watch them.
Miss, I wish to see if they break rules.
Right, go ahead.
They breathe out beautiful bubbles.
Really.
- Miss.
- What?
They speak vulgar language.
How can you hear in water?
They growl at each other.
- Miss.
- How is it?
They must be thirsty.
Why?
They drink at big gulps.
Really?
- Teacher...
- Yes?
They look like fish in my aquarium.
How do they like?
With protruding eyes.
How are they?
Don't press, children!
Want any drinks?
Oh, No!
No!
No!
Ying!
You do enjoy coaching swimming?
I love children and it is summer vacation.
I can keep fit as well.
Next month is the Miss Hong Kong Contest...
Miss Hong Kong.
I qualified for the Semi-Final.
How nice!
I am an insurance agent,
I can help you to make the right decision.
You look very smart.
Just like a royalty.
Hold on, let me do it with precision...
You have used too much of your hands.
The same old trick?
Let you take a through look at Ying.
You'll ruin my reputation.
Who ask you to take advantage.
He's a scum.
That's his nature.
He's always like that.
Ying, I'm Ki Ho Yan.
I'm Chan Hoi Sum.
- You can call me Big Eye.
- Remember me.
I'm studying fashion design.
I'll be a hair stylist.
I can design an evening gown for you.
I can design the perfect hair style for you.
Let me help you.
Hey, here is five bucks for you.
Don't let me pay the bill.
OK.
Trust me for a new hair style.
Let's go.
Bill please.
Yes.
- Here...
- Thanks...
Let me...
No, I must pay.
Please don't.
Hey, don't grip so tight, I can't shuffle.
It's my turn.
Why don't you pay.
You seldom pay.
What now?
It means I pay!
Why ask stupid question.
Do I have to pay you back?
Keep the change!
Yes, keep the change.
Thank you, Sir.
Ah Ying.
It's for you, Uncle.
Next time, no flowers just cash.
I considered the whole night.
And decided...
Keep calm!
To offer you this.
Good for you?
Only two men in the world are fit for it;
One is Stallon, the other one is you.
Really?
What Stal...
Stallon, Rambo!
Great swordsmanship!
Yeah!
It's sharp.
He said Rambo used it.
It is highly lethal!
Touching it is disastrous!
You saw it.
Real sharp.
It's sharp.
It cuts into your wallet.
I know, I've got 200 bucks only.
Even one eyebrow is worth 500.
I've got a blank check,
I'll fill in there.
It send chills to your back.
It does.
I go first.
Nut!
Not so chilly now!
Daughter!
Are you fond of these three?
No, we just met a few times.
Right.
Our daughter won't like common folks.
Papa, please!
Then, why did you invite them to dinner?
To manipulate them.
They flirt with Ah Ying.
With different excuses.
I'll make use of the three dogs.
To help Ying in the Beauty contest.
What, three dogs!
What do you take your daughter for?
Well, let the dogs watch each other!
Coming!
Hi, Ah Ying.
- You're come!
- Uncle!
Private collection.
You'll like it.
Oh, really.
- This is for you, Uncle.
- This is the most expensive one.
- It's just a little gift.
- Give it to Ying.
- Take care of it.
- Ying, take care of it.
Come in and sit down.
- Honey, ready for dinner.
- Uncle,
- It's a beautiful house.
- Uncle, I...
Auntie.
My name is Puddin Lai,
Ying must always mention me.
Yes, you are the hair-dresser, right!
Is business good?
So So.
Auntie, it smells good.
You are excellent cook!
This minced beef is good in color, smell and taste.
That's fried meatball!
Go out!
Sit outside.
- Auntie!
- Auntie!
- Let me give you a hand.
- You don't know fried meatballs!
Out!
- Let me help you, auntie...
- Let's go.
- Have tea please.
- Thank you, Ying.
Puddin Lai, do you excel in Fung-shui, and palmistry?
I am insurance agent, I study those in my spare time.
Uncle, let me read your palm.
It's thick and fleshy, good palm.
You're blessed, that's why you've a pretty daughter.
A rare good palm!
Uncle, let me go with Ying to her room.
To see her clothes and design a package for her.
Ying, let's go in.
No hurry, some other day.
I tried many brands of shampoo.
Can't decide the right one for my hair.
Can you help me?
Sure.
They are dry hair.
You are right, you see they split.
- Quite many splits.
- Yes.
Split, split, split on your dead body.
Who is dead?
Oh!
Your palm marks escape form death.
Which results in big riches.
That's better.
Yes.
It's all right.
Let me take good care of it.
Cut the crap.
Let's eat.
May I sit with you.
Sorry, move over.
- That's my seat.
- Sit over here.
Auntie.
So much delicacies.
Be at home.
Get started.
Cheers.
Mum.
They have longed to "dab" you for some time.
They always like to "dab" you too.
Yes "dab" your good wine.
Cheers.
Thank you for coming to "dab" our family.
Ying, watch your words!
Our pleasure!
Cheers.
Honey, drink for the occasion.
- Me too!
- Mum, it's a happy moment, drink.
OK, OK!
Great.
Good drinker...
Auntie, have another glass.
I can't drink much.
Doesn't matter, have another.
Drink it up.
We'll all very happy today.
I'll just drink it up.
Bravo.
Good drinker.
Please go ahead, I'll see to the fish.
- Uncle, you are hospitable.
- Make yourselves at home.
Papa.
- Mum?
- Auntie.
Call a crane?
Do it together.
She is real heavy.
You are useless.
Remove her, I can't breathe.
Hey, drank too much.
- Uncle, he takes too much.
- Throw it back, doesn't matter.
Have some source.
Get even.
Try again.
Come!
Marlboro, Marlboro.
Lemon tea, Lemon tea,
No air-con, no air-con.
You lost.
- The loser must drink.
- Drink it up.
- One more time.
- No way!
OK.
One more chance for you.
No air-con, no air-con.
Drink?
What are you waiting for?
No drink!
You lost, you should drink.
Yes, do it.
Drink.
Silly boy.
Drink it up.
Obstinate!
Come, hold him.
Open your mouth, relax.
One bit more, a little more, that's it.
Don't tease him.
That's good fun.
Dirty tricks!
- Angry already?
- Get angry so easy?
That's not a man.
Really angry?
Not me!
Uncle,
I like fun.
Why angry?
What are you up to?
No angry?
Why be angry.
It's mawkish!
So comfy, why be angry.
Can you take fun too?
Certainly.
Egg!
What for?
Stop that!
I am not angry, not at all.
Have bigger fun!
Come on, you have to do it.
Just for fun.
Go!
Second round.
Be quick!
Ying!
Bravo.
Papa, that's enough.
Nobody suffocates.
Continue!
- Oh, damn.
- Uncle.
Papa!
Sorry for that, Uncle.
- It's you.
- It's sorry.
Uncle is not angry.
No problem, no problem.
Uncle's face tells he is generous and forgiving.
Ha, Right, generous and forgiving.
Come, bottoms up!
Bottoms up!
Ying, let me see you home.
Good night.
You chaps can't drink.
Have more.
Bye-bye.
Where is Ying?
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.
Uncle, we are leaving.
Main door is not there, this way.
This way.
Good-bye, Uncle.
I need the toilet.
Where is the washroom?
Hold on, just press the button.
Wrong button.
Why it takes so long.
Just pull open the life door.
You first.
You first.
After you.
You don't get award for politeness.
Why hang clothes in the lift.
Who says no airing clothes in lifts?
Nonsense.
Real small lift!
So people hang their clothes here.
Why only clothes but no trousers?
Are we there?
Push, stupid!
- We arrived.
- Arrive where?
Repulse Bay.
Caribbean Sea!
Mermaid!
Over there!
Let's swim there.
Breast stroke!
Freestyle.
I don't know how to swim.
Give me a buoy.
A buoy!
What's happened?
My clothes?
It almost killed me.
Ying, what's the matter?
Nothing, Papa, I had a bad dream.
Bad dream?
Did we...
Tell me what happened.
Are you all right?
Go!
What's now?
We'll come back for you.
Ying, don't cry.
- We'll return.
- Yes.
Who took advantage of her?
I had no pat in anything, last right.
I slept so sound, nothing could wake me.
Can't be me.
I adore her so much.
I won't do anything indecent.
We don't even know whether anything happened.
- It's not you.
- Of course not.
And not you.
Then, it must be I.
Now that Ah Ying is mine, that means.
Your friend's wife.
You two should not even fancy for her.
Excuse me.
I'll pay for this meal.
Now I remember.
Last night the Mermaid, and I talked very happily.
I think it was me.
OK...
I admit.
It was I.
I don't want to say, but now I won't restrain.
Look, my whole body is sticky.
It is evidence of action.
You don't say.
Look at my stained trousers!
Must be I.
Wait.
Look here!
It's all over my head.
Everyone admits quality.
Then it is gang rape!
They talk of gang rape.
What kind of youth are they?
Hi, Happy!
Please, go in.
Ying, I wish...
Heavens.
I've never been so faithful, and becomes so heart-broken.
Ying paging me.
I don't like to see you again.
However I fell some changes in my body.
Take this for a test, tell me the results.
As soon as you know.
Ying.
What is this?
Perfume.
- Perfume?
- Try it.
Very strong.
It's urine!
For the test.
Why didn't you say so.
Let's go.
This is a bottle, not a barrel,
It doesn't take three to carry.
You do it tomorrow.
Me again.
But, for Ying, it is all right.
If the test verifies this is draft beer.
Thank heavens.
Take some urine.
Can I help you?
Urine test.
Put it on the tray.
What a coincidence!
What's wrong with you?
Oh... yes...
I can't urinate...
Give me a chance!
Is it V.D.?
No!
See if there is precipitant in the urine.
What do you test for?
Diabetes.
The usual test.
I'll do it.
Sir please.
Big Eye, what really do you test for?
You're so tense.
I don't know.
Whatever will be, will be.
Why so scared.
Worried for you.
- Ki Ho Yan!
- Yes!
You've diabetes.
Diabetes.
Be calm.
Is it serious?
Is it serious?
Ask a doctor.
Ask a doctor.
Right.
Go and see a doctor.
- Chuk Tai Chung.
- What's the result?
Why so nosy?
Congratulations.
Congratulations!
My god!
What my god!
Congratulations means I...
Positive!
Positive and you congratulate me?
Be more careful from now on.
Careful?
At my age?
I don't care, be it tender or not.
I'll take so far as I've got the urge.
Uncle, leave it.
This laboratory may not be reliable.
Go elsewhere.
Pregnancy test?
Again!
Congratulations on diabetes.
Nut!
Read the newspaper advertisements.
See who can cure diabetes.
Let's go.
What's the result?
Sugar in the urine.
Did you drink Ah Ying's urine,
You bastard.
What, Ah Ying!
How came you don't know,
I'll question them.
You three rats, who did it?
For the last time, who did it?
Torture them!
I don't want a gang rape scandal,
If you inform me of the culprit,
You'll get free,
If not, I'll break your eardrum.
Difficult choice.
Break friendship or,
Break eardrum.
It is your choice, who?
Yourself?
- Yes or no?
- Did you?
Go to hell!
- How is it?
- Sit down!
- How is it?
- Tell us.
I am deaf!
Deaf?
Are you sure?
How did he torture you?
Can you hear?
I can't, I can't!
- You can't?
- Never, never admit guilty!
He is ruthless.
Now what?
Our turn will come.
Puddin, come in.
- What's it?
Who is it?
- Me!
Auntie asks for you.
- You first.
- You!
No, you first.
My friend, listen to me.
Don't ever admit guilty.
Can you hear?
What?
Who?
- Did you do it?
Talk!
- Did you?
Talk!
Go to hell!
Are you really so cruel?
You're more cruel.
Information or eardrum?
It is better no choice is needed.
Did you do it?
Yes or no?
Admit of not?
Thanks for not breaking my eardrum.
No break, but smack.
Now, get out.
Made foal of us.
Hey, hey Uncle spared me.
What?
Tomorrow I'll register for you.
In the school for deaf dumb.
Your foul are smells real bad.
Should have stepped asides.
You two made fool of me.
How come you know nothing?
- Don't you wreck your daughter.
- Whatever, abort it!
Don't!
No, I won't do it!
Hack you to pieces.
Abort or die!
Ying, run away!
Quick!
Don't you run away!
You'll be prosecuted for gang rape.
Get ready for jail.
Come back.
You want her to be newspaper headline?
Quick.
Ying!
Taxi, Taxi!
Follow that taxi.
Quick!
Hey, stop!
We are not yet in!
Step on it
Driver!
Be fast!
Catch up with that taxi.
- Come on, faster.
- Alright...
Yes, it is that taxi in front.
After it...
Overtake it!
Why don't you go?
What's wrong?
Why do you stop?
Man, it is red light.
My license is 11 points off.
Want my license be suspended?
We are willing to pay for any penalty.
Right.
If you can catch up, we'll pay
You 100 dollars.
The license is mine, not yours.
Please!
OK.
Use you brain.
Birdy calling Elephant.
What's it.
Birdy?
Three passengers here request you
To wait for them.
Wait!
Who are they?
Tell him, we want our baby's mother.
Please, help us.
They want their baby's mother.
Lend a hand.
She shakes her head.
Alright?
She says no.
Tell her this:
Ah Ying.
That night, it was not a plot.
Ying, that night, it was not a plot.
Tell her I love her till heavens rot.
He loves you till... veins rot.
What... veins rot?
Miss, this one with rotten organs.
Must be a rascal.
Give him up.
The 'Rotten Organs' Shut up!
Next!
Tell her that I, Puddin Lai!
Smoking, no more; gamble no more;
spindrift, no...
He says:
Smoking, gambling, No... more!
Spindrift...
This one is rotten too.
Unwilling to give up smoking.
Spindrift is no good husband;
Next one.
Let me talk!
Ying.
Hey, it's my turn.
I am no good speaker,
I feel you are unwise,
What does a woman need?
A man who loves her for life.
Now, there are 3 men who do.
You ponder that coolly.
Now you're alone,
Homeless.
Uncased for.
Let's find you a quiet place,
Give birth to the child.
Verify the father by medical test.
One of us will care for you for life.
Let me!
Elephant, stop your car.
Let them meet.
Wait for the three rascals;
You must be out of your mind.
Not knowing how to speed, don't be driver.
Oh, no!
The three are real nice guys.
You are in luck.
To hell with driving license!
Bravo!
Hey, let me alight.
No way!
For you future's sake.
I won't let them get you.
Let me out!
- No trace of them!
- Right.
What than?
Elephant, tell me your position!
I can overtake you.
I was in Prince Rd., when you asked.
Now I am off to Lung Cheong Rd.
Come!
What do you want?
Let me out!
Go on, hit me.
I don't allow them to catch you.
Help, help!
Bastard!
Disturb my work!
Now, come out!
Come out!
Ying, don't go away!
Come, back to yourself!
Ying, you all right?
Are you all right?
Ying, You are really gorgeous!
You guys have taste;
worth risking my license.
Shut up!
Elephant!
Serve him right!
Ying, what we just said in the taxi.
Do you agree?
- We do mean it.
- Yes!
Do you consent?
Wow!
Great!
This place is a bit small.
But, for one person, I hope it is OK right?
Yes.
Ying, forget anything else.
Just concentrate on baby-making.
What do you take her for?
How to make babies?
With whom?
Ying, I studied this place,
Nothing escapes from my eyes.
This home will bring you riches,
Food, clothing and many children.
Cute, isn't it?
Be careful.
What!
I'm infuriated.
- Pregnancy education.
- Pregnancy education!
Don't you like to have a cute baby?
You call this thing cute baby?
Shame on you, queer thing!
You are cute, eh?
Look at you.
I can't pass the days in peace.
Good brothers!
Touching!
Too good to be separated!
They are a lovely couple
who want to stay together forever.
But they have to be separated.
Even gourmets.
Have never lasted such good celery with chicken.
Is this celery?
Sure.
Have one good bite, Ying.
For celery, we eat the stem, not the leaves.
Ignorant!
Imperial!
But, look at the green, so tempting.
That makes your mouth water.
Leave the good things for later.
Ying, it's for you.
Have a spare rib.
You guys don't know delicacies.
For good things, a little is enough.
Since it is from Ah Ying, I'll take it.
Happy.
Both happy!
Salty.
Vegetables in!
All charcoal!
Little bit makes it more tasty.
What is that?
Fish!
Hard like a rock.
Disgraceful!
It's fresh
The inside is edible.
See, Ying says it is edible.
Eat, then?
- Ah Ying tells us to eat.
- Go ahead.
Even dog shit is good.
Don't, it is polluted.
Nowadays, sea water, everywhere is polluted.
Can't worry too much.
Don't eat it.
Have vegetables.
Anything wrong with the fish?
Talk!
What are you afraid of?
Can't be from the garbage bin?
Smart boy!
Bang on!
You saw me eating it!
Were you dumb!
Why blame me!
You said just now.
That even dog shit is good.
Right, Ying?
Gourmet's delight!
Pig's belly and bean curd soup.
Good for skin.
It tastes good.
Greed will take your life.
It's bitter!
Sour!
It's all the better; don't waste it.
The smart man differs from an idiot.
In that:
The idiot feeds you with celery leave.
Making like to vomit.
What's so funny?
The smart guy makes pig's belly.
Into a delicacy.
A bonus!
That is gourmet's vomit.
Ying, don't touch that soup.
Don't drink it.
Eat something else.
This is half fatty and half lean.
Ying, did I do something wrong?
Sorry.
I am stupid can'ttakegoodcareofyou.
No,
I am homesick.
Don't be sad.
When the baby is born.
There will be a happy reunion.
You are so kind.
Kindest in the three of us?
The three of you...
No!
Don't.
Before the father is confirmed.
No such thing.
OK.
OK., I'm sorry, sorry.
What's wrong?
I want tissue paper.
I have.
Yes.
I...
Here...
Are you all right?
Sorry, I spoiled your shirt.
I'll clean it for you.
It's all right.
Go ahead.
Breathe out!
Wait!
No more.
Then, I get nothing.
Never mind; go on; throw out!
Thank you.
Can I keep the clothes now?
Look at them!
What are they up to.
- First time here?
- Yes.
What's the father name?
- Mr. X.
- Mr. X?
Oh X, anything you say.
Miss, your father!
Papa!
Uncle!
Papa!
Why haven't seen you for two months.
Boarding School in the countryside.
Boarding School?
You, you, you, come here.
Get in.
Miss, better get in the shade.
Uncle!
Uncle, do we come in.
Dial 999?
You guys shut up!
The matter is not finished.
I don't want a scandal.
Be careful!
Don't let that barber know the truth.
Laugh, everybody!
Uncle, what are you up to?
Now, Ying refused to abort.
That means she has to marry one of you.
The lucky man has to pay me half million U.S. Dollars.
Not a cent less.
Your Papa has changed.
So friendly to the three.
How about a discount of kin's.
Hold it.
Money is real, kinship is shit.
60 tables in wedding banquet, and one apartment, only 1,300 square feet is fine.
No dry smile.
Laugh.
Real funny.
Papa!
Papa, can we go home now?
Daughter, you can't go home.
You are growing bigger everyday, only 7 months more.
Try persevere it.
Let's go.
Bye, Uncle.
Laugh, again, next time.
Half a million.
60 tables.
1,300 square feet.
- Are you still in?
- Yes!
Yes!
Ying, we'll work hard for you.
Escort her home first.
Go, Ah Ying.
It's fate, you can't change it.
Prophet Lai.
Sit please.
My friend, you have eyes like tiger's.
Prophet Lai, you don't recognise me?
Oh, Mr. Taxi-driver!
You escaped an accident, shout prosper afterwards.
Let me advice you how to make big fortunes.
That is fine.
I take you as a living god.
Good.
You said you don't have consulting office?
But, I have a wife and a child now.
Let us go back to you.
- Your brow is like the glowing sun.
- Yes?
But there is a tinge of black cloud.
You can't wipe it off that way.
Something may be in your way recently.
Exactly!
Prophet, you're a living god.
- Let me see your palm.
- Sure.
Work hard on the wheels...
Yes, Yes!
The other one,
You'll be landlord!
Prophet Lai.
You work wonders!
Some mean guys want to outbid me.
Where is the property?
Connaught Centre.
Good judgement!
Commercial unit, good bet!
Not an unit, the whole block!
Ah..., the first time I saw you,
I knew the sky is your limit.
You're an aristocratic face.
I give you some sacred writings remember.
Put one on your chest, one on your bed,
One under the bed;
don't wet it even in bath.
When wet, it loses it's power.
3 days later.
Whoever bid against you will die.
- Ah Chiu!
- Yes!
Five Thousand dollars for the Prophet.
My secretary.
Thank you, thank you.
Thanks, Mr. Chiu.
Your face is a rarity of the century.
Have a thorough look.
Ho Yan, is this sausage or trousers.
Sorry, I'll do it again.
Do it right, must be finished by the morning.
- You know?
- I know.
Why do you over-exert yourself so much?
Getting married.
Ah!
Get a girl to marry you.
And a son coming soon.
A son too!
Bonus for you naughty chap.
Maybe!
You nut!
You are black man in black forest.
What does it mean?
All in the dark.
Is it OK?
Come again.
See you.
Sorry Miss, we are closing up.
- After finished me.
- Boss.
What's the matter?
Step in please.
Boss, let me do one more.
OK.
Thank you, Boss.
Fighting hard again.
Sit please.
Happy, working hard, eh?
Can't help it.
- I've to shoulder up the family.
- Really something.
Bye-bye.
What cut you like?
A bit shorter.
Happy!
Hi, Honey
So, you changed salon.
Have a kiss.
Quiet!
Boss, three more jobs, please.
OK.
We know what to do.
Sit.
OK.
Let's start.
How long does it take?
Make mine first.
Why everybody looks so tried?
No.
I was born healthy.
I am strong.
I've got a good heart.
We are overflowed with energy, we need a fight!
Where is the towel?
It's a nice area.
At least, the air is fresh?
- What's the matter?
- Ah Ying, are you alright?
Let me help you.
It kicks me.
My son is so naughty.
Careful!
My dear boy, two more months.
You will come and decide our fate.
Hands off!
By that time, two fragile hearts... will be broken.
Don't worry, I'll give you some glue.
To mend them.
Mend your skull.
In fact, all three of you are gentlemen.
Hard-working, reliable,
And smart!
When I marry one of you.
Will you still be good friends?
We've listened to you.
We are good friends all along?
Yes, quite good.
Wow, wow your mother!
Her mother is a bitch, don't you spare her?
What kind of man are you?
Ying, you know what he is like.
Old man, I am nervous.
Feel my hand, it is like ice.
Nice to have a grandchild.
Why so tense, sit down.
You're here.
Daddy, mammy.
Father-in-law, mother-in-law.
Hold it!
My grandchild doesn't have 3 fathers.
Go!
Get lost!
Or else I hack you to pieces, and feed the dogs.
All right.
Go home first!
Go!
Put those down.
Go now.
Mammy!
What?
This is my blood type.
If it is proven that the son is mine.
I'll buy you a big present.
Mammy, if it is mine, I'll kneel and serve you tea.
- Iron proof of father and sod, Mammy.
- Mum.
Is that floor show?
Go!
Go away, go!
How many blood types are there?
Two.
Male and female.
Which are these?
This...
English; what does it say?
This is odd, all are A type!
All the gods in heaven.
It must be a son.
So I expect.
Don't know yet.
Thanks for taking care of Ah Ying so far, how about christening for my son.
You're dreaming.
How about Plum Lai.
Plum stone.
Mammy!
Mammy is here.
Son or girl?
What is it?
Does it look like me?
Of the same blood type?
Mammy, tell us.
Mammy, tell us please.
It's a son.
Wow, Great.
I knew it!
It's an illegitimate son.
Pa sold it to Godfather.
Sold my son!
Going to Canada tomorrow.
Take it back.
Godfather has money and power.
Don't fancy taking it back.
Mammy?
Go away!
Mammy!
What, now?
We must stick together for once.
OK.
United.
Nut!
Come on...
Milk for you, son.
This way brings luck.
- It's a wall.
- Right.
Use your brain.
Climb!
Right.
You make so much trouble.
Naughty dog.
Run quickly.
Where are you son?
- Big eye boy.
- Big nose boy.
North-west.
Let's go.
Big eye boy.
- Big eye boy.
- Big nose boy.
Go!
Are you Superman?
Find ways.
South-east, impossible.
I was right.
Little Puddin, here I come.
Good baby, nice baby.
You'll fly tomorrow.
They sky is smiling.
Here comes the Piggy.
Morning in Heavenly Village is so nice.
But something big is happening.
The 4-eyed monster is causing trouble.
It was an accident.
It's a joke.
Forget it.
Don't be nosy.
Go to bed.
I am dying.
BOO-BEE I come.
God gives me power.
Damned.
Run.
Why?
He-man!
Go inside!
Otherwise there will be chaos.
Dr. Slump, were you struck by lightning?
"BOO-BEE" "BOO-BEE" Of course, I nearly fainted.
What's the matter?
Mirror's reflection will betray you, idiot!
Preserved plum.
Transform to Superman.
- Fly, fly.
- Great.
Superman, fly.
Superman, you did it again.
Superman, come back here.
This way, quick.
You'll get lost in the fog.
Not this way, that way.
Send him to sleep!
Doctor.
Superman is sleeping!
Go on with your studies.
Save him by artificial respiration.
The phone is ringing.
Hello.
Heavenly Village is sleeping.
Call tomorrow.
What bad timing!
I'll take it!
Everyone is sleeping.
Troublesome!
Baby?
No baby.
Boo-bee.
Superman is awake!
We can go on with the game.
Not in bed yet?
Hi, pretty, hold on a minute.
A kiss.
Kiss.
Let me do it.
Evil to evil.
Still more.
Funny!
- Pass to me.
- Funny enough!
Hold it!
Let go!
It's my son.
I am done for.
Take care of my son.
Arrest them all.
Son!
Give it back!
Son!
Ah Keung.
Rush the baby to hospital.
Quick.
Go to the hospital.
Miss...
Ying, come quick to Baptist Hospital.
Tell you everything later.
Hurry!
If anything happens to my son, you...
Your son?
He is my flesh and blood.
I bought it.
Signed in lawyer's office.
You...
Your money, big deal!
Here's the doctor.
How is it?
It is suffering from concussion.
I must operate at once.
The father please sign.
I'll sign...
I am the legal father.
Even if the baby survived, it will be retarded.
Idiot!
They are the real kin, sign!
Retarded child!
No control of everything.
- Let me sign.
- Probably becomes vegetable child.
- I prefer a cabbage.
- Vegetable!
I'll sign.
Son, Pa and Ma will care for you.
Love you forever.
Thanks Doctor.
Why rush for everything.
Have you thought it over?
Can't care for yourself.
Son, dead!
Son.
A doll!
If it was real, imagine going into my house?
You think they would let you in?
- Back to you.
- Where is my son?
- Ying!
- Son!
Son!
Good boy.
Just my replica.
You're joking.
Daddy.
My part is finished now.
I must report duty, otherwise I'll be fired.
By the superintendent.
Ah, it is a plot to make fun on us.
Not fun.
It's my plan to test you.
You three love Ah Ying the same, and of the same blood group.
All 'A' type.
Queer type!
- All 'A' type.
- Big Eye Boy.
Big Eye Boy, you are the kindest, so devoted to Ying.
Marrying you, make me feel secure.
Woman!
Hold it.
Until there is the flat.
60 tables, 1/2 a million dollars, you can meet only once a month.
Shut up!
Have the wedding next month.
The number of tables doesn't matter.
Really, mother?
Any complaint?
- No!
- Come with me.
- Son, call your Daddy.
- Call Daddy.
Lost the last minute.
Heaven's will!
You're lucky.
Big Eye.
You two cheer up.
You're still good friends.
Right!
Of course.
Son, this is Big Uncle, that is second Uncle.
Who does he look like?
Such big nose, it looks...
Ah!
Resembles me.
It belongs to Ying and me.
Ying, we shall have a squad of Big Eye Boys.
Are you capable?
We'll see.
OK.
- Have a hair-cut.
- No way.
And you.
Help!
Don't run.
Daddy...
Daddy, brother wants to cut my hair again.
Don't do that.
Nobody lets me to cut.
Last time, your lousy cut.
Made me the laughing stock for 3 months.
I am laughed at too.
Laugh at you, why?
My nose is big, eyes small, I don't look like you.
They say I look like Uncle Chan...
Don't mind what people say, you're my dear son,
Daddy loves you the same.
Mammy.
Come on, Granny's here.
Baby, come to Granny.
Let grandma hold you.
Come, give grandma a kiss.
Ying, Daddy.
Coffee please.
Come here, Ying.
What's the test result?
You guess.
No need to test.
Ying never disappoints you.
Wow, we have another child.
Viva Mammy.
Son.
Ying is having your sixth child.
Bearing a child is real tough, you know?
I know, that's why I love Ying so much.
You should, you should.
Daddy, you should be happy too;
The flat, 1/2 a million, all delivered.
I am happy.
No complain at all.
But, if there is a big yacht, we can enjoy on the sea, right?
Big yacht.
No problem.
You can afford it.
How about buying a big yacht?
Good!
Bravo!
You're the best son-in-law.
Thank you, Dad.
Put it in my name.
- Yours again?
- Mine again.
# You must remember this

(Lionel) It's nice to be on our own.
(Jean) Yes, it is.
(Lionel) We seem to have been overwhelmed by people lately.
- I wouldn't say overwhelmed.
- I would.
(Jean) I sometimes think there's a hermit in you, trying to get out.
You'd be perfectly happy living in a cave somewhere.
- Would you move in with me?
- Only if it had central heating.
- It wouldn't have a telephone, for sure.
- I'd like a front door, though.
Well, people knock on front doors.
You wouldn't want them just walking into the cave, would you?
True.
Well, perhaps a big boulder would do the trick.
Or perhaps...
- Quick!
Hide!
- Woo!
What are you doing?
- I've just seen Alistair.
- Oh!
Lionel, we're grown-ups.
- We can't just hide behind a tree.
- Yes, we can.
I just wanted a nice quiet Saturday to myself, with you.
Well, where was Alistair?
- Back there somewhere.
- I know he's there somewhere.
Otherwise we wouldn't be on this side.
Can't you be more precise?
- What do you want, a map reference?
- Look, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Did he see you?
If he'd seen us, there'd be no point in us hiding.
Oh.
No.
- Shall I have a peep?
- No!
Oh!
Don't pull me about!
I'm sorry but just stay put.
Well, what happens if he walks past?
Do we just hope he doesn't turn round, or do we edge round to the back of the tree?
- You're making very light of this.
- Well, it's hard to take seriously, isn't it?
He could have turned round.
- I'm going to have a peep.
- No!
- Boo!
- Oh!
Now, why should you two be hiding from me?
- We weren't hiding at all.
- No.
- No, just erm...
leaning against the tree.
- Tree, yes.
Canoodling.
Canoodling!
What a great old expression that was.
Is.
What a great old expression that is.
Now, you may be surprised that we bumped into each other in a park.
We wouldn't be surprised if we bumped into you in the Kalahari Desert.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I belled Judy and she told me where you were.
And do I have news!
I assume that's a rhetorical question.
- Li, you're scowling.
- I feel like scowling.
Well, let's go and find somewhere to sit, I'll tell you my news, and your face will be wreathed in smiles.
Let's go!
Yes, I'll say this for Alistair: he's an optimist.
You're still scowling, Li.
- It's my face.
- It's not medieval, you know.
- I never said it was.
- No, not Lionel's face,
- I mean the verb, canoodle.
- I didn't mean to imply it was.
I have to say to you both that this is not one of your more receptive days.
- You haven't given us anything to receive yet.
- Then try this.
Mike Barbosa stepped off a plane this morning.
Is it too much to hope that it was in midair at the time?
From Los Angeles.
And he wants a little meet.
- Shall we do the joke, or not?
- Let's just hear the rest.
- Why?
- To bring you some great news!
- Can't you tell me?
- I don't know what it is.
- Then how do you know it's great?
- Because Mike flew in especially to see you.
Well, that's a step forward, Lionel.
Last time, he fitted you in between buying socks.
I've had a whiz round.
- Is there anything else?
- No, thanks, I'm in good order.
It's damn cheek, Mike Barbosa inviting himself to tea.
Oh, now, be fair, he invited us to tea at The Savoy, but you made it sound like an expedition to the South Pole.
I see he gets the best cups and saucers, as well.
Now, what is it about Americans that brings out the worst in you?
I've nothing against Americans as such.
It's Americans who are in television.
They're all hoo-hah.
- Hoo-hah?
- Yes.
Don't forget that this particular American has a lot to do with your miniseries being seen on the screen.
I hope he doesn't ask how the Queen is again.
That wasn't Mike, it was Cy.
Who's now in a loony bin.
That bodes well, doesn't it?
- Who replaced Cy?
- Sol.
- A model of mental stability, I might add.
- You've never met the man.
I'm taking a leaf out of Alistair's book, being optimistic.
- (Doorbell rings)
- Ooh!
That's probably them.
Now, big smile, now.
That won't do.
Think of canoodling.
Go on!
(Laughs)
This is really nice.
English tea in an English home.
Lionel, you have a beautiful place here.
It isn't mine, it's Jean's.
Another cucumber sandwich?
No, thank you, Jean.
I'm watching my starch intake.
Aren't we all?
So...
Mike, you were saying how much Sol liked the first episode.
He described himself as "enraptured".
- He's not in therapy, is he?
- Sol?
Ha!
Sol is one of the best-balanced guys I know.
I mean, this is a man who finds time to play with the kids from his first three marriages.
Does "enraptured" mean he wants the whole thing rewritten?
(Chuckles) There goes Lionel with the jokes again.
Lionel, you have my word.
But the script just needs a little fine-tuning, which Manny can handle in LA.
- Who's Manny?
- Sol's brother-in-law, but a distinguished writer in his own right.
This fine-tuning, it's not a major service, is it?
Tiny, tiny alterations.
We just have to make your England a little more acceptable to Middle America.
Which brings us to the real reason for Mike's visit.
It is socks again?
Locations.
Mike is already looking for locations, and does he have a great idea!
Yes, do I have a great idea?
Well, we shall never know if you don't tell us.
Lionel, do you remember your dad's house?
Of course I remember my dad's house.
I would just love to see that house.
It sounds perfect to serve as your birthplace.
It was my birthplace!
- Great!
- I'm not sure Lionel's father and his wife would like a film crew trampling all over the house.
They lead very quiet lives down there.
Almost monastic.
- (Laughing) Rocky and Madge?
- Yes.
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, I just want to see the place.
Well, you could write, Lionel.
Or we could get really modern.
Oh, all right.
By the way, Jean, I thought that love scene was just beautiful.
Oh, good.
I helped Lionel write that, in bed.
Hello, Father, it's Lionel.
- (Snare drums)
- Who?
Your son.
What is that din?
Madge is on the drums.
Hold it a minute, dear, will you?
(Madge) I'm trying to get my lick right.
She's trying to get her lick right.
- (Drumming stops)
- Ah!
Now, what were you saying?
Look, I have a Mr Barbosa here, he'd like to see the house sometime.
- We're not open to the public.
- I know that.
He may want to use it in the miniseries.
- What as?
- A house, of course.
He may want to do some filming there.
- Somebody wants us to be in a film!
- Oh, how exciting!
When does he want to come down?
Well, that's the thing, you see.
I mean, it's probably inconvenient, and if you don't fancy the idea at all...
Don't fancy it?
We'd love it!
Bring him down for lunch tomorrow, eh?
Oh.
Oh, jolly good.
Right.
Erm, bye, Father.
Cheerio, and give your cutie a kiss from me.
Erm, would tomorrow be too soon?
- Perfect!
- Terrif!
Oh, and he sent my cutie a kiss.
Cutie?
Oh!
So much for a quiet weekend.
It's rather exciting, though, isn't it?
I mean, we shall see it being filmed.
- Surprised Mike didn't ask Buckingham Palace.
- Oh, he did, but they turned him down.
Oh, no.
No, no, those mustn't go in there.
- Well, they do in the commercials.
- Yes, but this is real life.
Just give them here.
There you are.
No, don't do this.
- Just go and sit down.
- I don't want to, I want to be alone with you.
Huh!
That's an odd thing to say over the sink, but I like the thought.
- This fine-tuning that Mike mentioned...
- I asked him about that.
- Tiny, tiny alterations is what he said.
- Written by somebody's brother-in-law.
Being a brother-in-law doesn't disqualify you from writing.
Just so long as they don't make us do ridiculous things.
Like hiding behind trees?
That was an act of desperation.
Your heart has never really been in this, has it?
I'd never have considered it if it hadn't been for the money.
Spoken like a true artist.
And when it's all over, what do I do then?
- Then you write your Oscar acceptance speech.
- This is for television.
Oh, OK, if you want to nit-pick.
Look on the bright side.
If this is a smash, you'll be picked up.
- By whom?
- Not young starlets, if that's what you hope.
Film companies, television companies.
You could be hot property.
- Or a condemned building.
- Oh...
What was that for?
Well, for being, as Rocky says, such a dismal Jimmy.
Why all this talk about afterwards?
You don't have to do anything afterwards.
- Just lounge about?
- If that's what you want to do.
We're all right financially.
Oh, yes, as long as I send you out to work.
You don't send me out to work, I enjoy it.
You make it sound as if I scrub doorsteps for a living.
- You don't see things the way I do.
- Well, just as well, the mood you're in.
I'm not in a mood, I'm just... concerned, that's all.
Well, you don't need to be.
That's the point.
I do, because...
Because what?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all, really.
(Mike) Driver!
Hold it there!
Alistair, it's magnificent!
- Not bad, is it?
- I love it!
I love it, Lionel!
- Good.
- Let's drive on up there.
This isn't Los Angeles.
We could walk the full 20 yards.
Hey, that's a great idea!
Let's walk!
- Did you fall asleep in there?
- No, it's this chair.
I kind of slumped into it.
You look about three feet tall!
Well, would you mind just giving me a hand?
- Sorry, yes.
- Oh!
Oh!
Dignity.
Always dignity.
Oh!
Hello, Mrs Bale.
How are things in the English Channel?
Calm as a millpond.
How nice to see you again, Miss Pargetter.
- Hello, Mrs Bale.
You've met Alistair?
- Still on the tequila sunrises, Mrs Bale?
I've moved on to Black Russians.
And this is Mr Barbosa, an associate of mine.
Mike, this is Mrs Bale, my father's housekeeper.
Mike?
That face!
That face!
- What's wrong with my face?
- Wrong?
Wrong!
It's...
It's incredible!
It's...
Plantagenet!
Alistair... would you look at this hall!
It's going to be a long day.
Are Madge and Rocky at home?
I expect them back shortly.
They went to the leisure centre.
I shouldn't have asked.
What are we going to drink to?
What are we going to drink to, Madge?
- The future, what else?
- (All) The future!
You...
You've hit the spot again, Mrs Bale.
One tries.
- Where have the boys gone?
- Boys?
Alistair was showing Mike round.
Mike was running upstairs shouting, "Perfect!
Perfect!"
Oh, I like Mike.
He's exuberant.
I wonder if he'd like a crack on my drums?
This business of filming in the house, if Mike decides to, have you really thought it through?
I can't be doing, thinking things through.
It takes forever!
Quite right.
Go with the flow!
Lunch will be served at 1:24.
Is that relevant, Mrs Bale?
Unless you all want to go hungry, yes.
Now, what do you think, Jean Pargetter?
It is Plantagenet.
No, I mean about this filming lark.
Oh.
You understand that Mike wants to film the house?
I don't think he'd offer you parts.
Perhaps that's just as well.
We'd probably crack his lens.
- And then there's the lolly!
- What lolly?
Oh, come on, my boy, we wouldn't say yes just to cement Anglo-American relations.
We're talking bucks.
- Yes, greenbacks.
- You're not silly, you two, are you?
Only when we're having fun!
Are you all right, Mrs Bale?
I'm afraid lunch will be postponed until 1:47.
I have been unnerved.
- A change of weather in the Channel?
- No.
Mr Barbosa.
He wants to use me.
In what sense?
He wants me to be in the film.
He wants me to play Mr Lionel's nanny.
- I didn't have a nanny!
- So I told him, but he kept saying, "I must use that face."
Oh, rock on, I say.
Yes, fame beckons, Mrs Bale.
Just a minute, what's a nanny doing in it?
There's no nanny in my script.
There is, according to Mr Barbosa, in your childhood scenes.
What childhood scenes?
- Sounds like the brother-in-law's fine-tuning.
- Yes.
Well, we'll see about that!
He always did fly off the handle, that boy.
I'm sorry I mentioned it now.
I must get on with lunch, or it will drag on till 1:57.
I'd better find Lionel before blood is spilt.
I don't see what all the fuss is about.
I mean, nobody takes television seriously.
It's only pretend.
If Lionel punches Mike on the nose, it won't be.
Of all the crackbrained, half-witted ideas.
Just Two People, it's called.
Just two grown-up people.
My childhood is an irrelevance.
Li, cool it, please.
We were all children once.
That's a profound statement, if ever I heard one.
I want to talk to Mike.
Where is he?
He's...
He's wandering about somewhere.
Look, Li, we do not need alienation.
I don't care what we need, I want to talk to him.
- Hey...
Lovely lady.
- Will you stop calling her that?
Jean, could you please keep at least one of Lionel's feet on the ground?
Not if he's hopping mad.
- Very funny.
- Mind you, he has a right to be.
Somebody's brother-in-law sticking in extra scenes, it's not fair.
I suppose he's also got a scene of me taking part in Trooping The Colour.
- He has, hasn't he?
- Look, Li, these things are open to debate.
Then find Mike, and let's debate.
After lunch, though.
It's never wise to debate on an empty stomach.
Who told you that?
Benjamin Disraeli?
(Mike) Hey, you guys!
- Mike?
- Up here!
Look, there he is, there he is.
I'm in the attic.
It's unbelievable!
- Pardon?
- The attic, it's unbelievable!
I can't hear you.
Could you lean out a bit more?
Don't you see, Lionel?
This bit of back story, it adds colour.
- It adds, um...
- Poignancy.
Poignancy, poignancy.
We get to see the little boy who became the man.
What about the little girl who became the woman?
What a great idea!
We could get to meet the young Jean, in an orphanage.
- Orphanage?
- That just came to me, out of left-field.
Pity you didn't leave it there.
I'm still bothered about the fox-hunting.
Rocky, it's so British, it's so colourful.
- It's so cruel.
- What about a paper chase?
- No, thanks, I'm full up.
- What I meant is instead of the fox-hunting.
- With the boy Lionel as the hare, you mean?
- Could be, could be.
- I never liked running.
- Oh, go on.
I could watch from the orphanage window!
Jean, that was only an idea.
And as soppy as the rest of them.
- I did think the Christmas party sounded fun.
- Madge, it would tear at the heartstrings.
Especially interspersed with my scene at the orphanage with my pathetic rag doll.
- I don't understand all this servant business.
- Tradition.
All the servants line up to present the young Lionel with their touching Christmas gifts.
But we didn't have servants.
All we had was old Mrs Twillet.
She came in to do, twice a week.
- Let's remember poetic licence.
- Poetic claptrap!
- I'd like to say something.
- Shoot, Mrs Bale.
Mr Barbosa, I have considered your offer, but have decided not to play Nanny.
It wasn't actually an offer.
You see, I lead a quiet life, and I rather like it that way.
Having your handprints in cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater may be some people's idea of enjoyment, but I'm far happier with a good book and the Shipping Forecast.
Alistair?
Probably a wise decision on the whole, Mrs Bale.
I think so.
But I am rather pleased to learn that I have a Plantagenet face.
- OK, where were we?
- Lionel had just said, "Claptrap!"
The most restrained expression I could use, in mixed company.
Oh, I don't mind a good swear!
She's been known to turn the air blue herself, has Madge.
Who's going to start the swearing off?
People, please!
I'm beginning to feel outnumbered here.
I do stress, these are only tentative suggestions.
If they stay that way, fine.
But I won't agree to scenes that depict me as Little Lord Fauntleroy and Jean as Little Orphan Annie.
Would you excuse us?
Does Lionel have final script approval?
- Of course not.
- Excellent!
Believe me, Lionel, I've taken your criticisms on board and I shall straighten out Manny as soon as I get to LA.
- Thank you.
- And not a nose punched.
I've got a bit lost.
Now, does this mean that you are going to be filming the old place or not?
Sir, I think this house is a dream location.
We shall be talking to you.
- We don't come cheap.
- We don't pay cheap.
Well, that sounds jolly good!
- Now, come on, who's for a game of pool?
- Oh, I'm on.
I'd love to, but Alistair and I have to go to Edinburgh, Scotland.
Yes, we have to see a man who knows a man, you know...
- Can we give you a lift to town?
- That's very kind, but Lionel and I are going to make love this afternoon.
Good.
Um...
How very...
Well, we'll catch you later.
We'll see you out.
Yes.
Tell me, Mike, this limo of yours, is it a souped-up job?
Hey, hey!
You two.
Woof!
Now, why one earth did you say that?
I didn't want to get stuck in the car seat again.
I said the first thing that came into my head.
Well, you really must stop saying things like that.
- Well, "a snooze in the garden" sounds dull.
- Yes, true.
- Well, shall we?
- Shall we what?
Well, have a snooze in the garden.
Yes, OK.
- It's lovely here.
- Yes, it is.
We should be making a move soon.
We're welcome to stay.
Madge and Rocky said so.
I know.
But they're having some friends round, and that'll degenerate into a country and western evening.
We'll make a move soon.
Ah, here they are.
You know, you amaze me, you young people.
You seem to do nothing but sprawl about.
- What have you two been doing?
- Playing croquet.
The vicious variety.
Yes, but I'm glad we caught you.
We wanted a word.
- Rocky, what are you doing?
- Ordering a round of drinks.
Oh, don't worry, it's only a starter's pistol.
(Chuckles)
It's much more civil than shouting, don't you think?
Well, come on, Mrs Bale, let's be hearing from you.
She enjoys it too, you know.
- Now, where was I?
- (Jean) Having a word.
Ah, yes.
Yes, of course.
Where shall I start, Madge?
No shilly-shallying, plunge straight in.
Quite right, of course.
Lionel, my boy, we want you to have the house.
Oh, don't gawp dear.
It doesn't suit you.
I simply...
Why do you want to give me the house?
Well, we haven't gone peculiar, if that's what you're implying.
No...
Lionel's just shocked.
People don't give away houses every day, do they?
No, I suppose not, but, anyway, it makes very good sense.
You see, Madge and I are mostly globe-trotting at the moment.
We're hardly ever here.
As a matter of fact, we're off to Lithuania on Wednesday.
- I didn't know anyone went to Lithuania.
- That's why we're going.
Look here, you can't just give me a house!
I can do anything I damn well like!
It would have come to you eventually, anyhow.
- What about Madge?
- Oh, don't worry about me.
I've got the cottage.
Rocky and I will use that as a base.
- I just don't know what to say.
- I do.
- What happens to Mrs Bale?
- (Rocky) We shan't have her put down!
She can look after the cottage for us, and if you needed help out here, just fire a starter's pistol.
We'll have to refine this signalling system.
One shot doesn't signify which drink you require.
I'm quite good at archery.
What about arrows with messages on?
- Well, we shall see.
- We've told the young 'uns the good news.
And have our thank yous been said?
I'm still recovering.
I'm very grateful, Dad.
Oh, stuff and nonsense!
You're a bit on the serious side for my liking, but I'm really quite fond of you.
I think you're dear people.
Both of you.
Just give us a few weeks to clear out our junk, and it's all yours.
We don't expect you to live in it all the time, of course, but it'll do for weekends and so on, won't it?
- Do?
- Do?
I always said he'd find the right girl.
- Took him long enough.
- Hark who's talking!
Now, you will be kind to your vassals and serfs, won't you?
- What?
- Vassals and serfs.
- What vassals and serfs?
- Ha!
It doesn't matter.
Drink your drink.
Thanks.
Do you think Mike will tell Manny to forget all that Merry England stuff?
- Do you know something?
I don't care.
- Oh, I wish you meant that.
I do, I really do.
I'll write the second episode, they'll mangle it, and I don't care.
They can turn it into a musical as far as I'm concerned.
Oh!
#Just two people
I'm writing the opening number.
Are we alone?
Er...
Unless there's somebody under the sofa, yes.
- I meant Judith or Sandy.
- Yes, I know you did.
Yes, they left a note on the fridge:
"Painting the town."
- I'm glad.
- You're getting very liberal.
- I mean, I'm glad they're out.
- Mm.
So am I. At last we've got a bit of weekend to ourselves.
- That was very well timed.
- I didn't know you were going to lean on me.
- I wasn't going to lean, just snuggle up.
- No, that would get in the way at the moment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- The way of what?
- Well...
All this should have happened all those years ago.
Your letter would have reached me in Korea and I would have come home, and...
Well, actually, I'd have done this.
Ooh!
But my knee wouldn't have clicked then.
- Yes.
- No, it wouldn't.
Yes, I will marry you.
- Well, I haven't asked you yet.
- But you were going to, weren't you?
Yes, but I'd sooner actually say it, if it's all the same to you.
Sorry.
- Are you all right down there?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Now, you may...
Thank you.
You may think that I've taken a long while getting around to this.
- Yes!
- What?
No.
- There is a reason.
- Cold feet?
- May I finish, or not?
- Sorry, sorry.
I didn't really have anything to offer you.
I mean, dribs and drabs of money from the book, the odd lecture.
I mean, the television money, that's fine, but it won't last forever.
But now, with a house, I can offer you something proper, something real.
That's why you were going on about the money.
It probably sounds stupid, but that's the way I am.
No, it's not stupid.
And there's something else.
- Oh, is there?
- Yes.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
And I don't think I've ever stopped loving you.
Well, that's it, really.
- I love you, too.
- Well, that's good.
- Can I say yes now?
- Yes, please.
Yes.
There's always something, isn't there?
- What is it?
- My knee's locked!
It doesn't matter.
# You must remember this
# A kiss is still a kiss
# A sigh is just a sigh
# The fundamental things apply
# As time goes by
# And when two lovers woo
# They still say I love you
# On that you can rely
# The world will always welcome lovers
# As time goes by #
# You must remember this
# A kiss is still a kiss
# A sigh is just a sigh
# The fundamental things apply
# As time goes by #
It's nice to be on our own.
Yes, it is.
We seem to have been overwhelmed by people lately.
- I wouldn't say overwhelmed.
- I would.
I sometimes think there's a hermit in you, trying to get out.
You'd be perfectly happy living in a cave somewhere.
- Would you move in with me?
- Only if it had central heating.
- It wouldn't have a telephone, for sure.
- I'd like a front door, though.
Well, people knock on front doors.
You wouldn't want them just walking into the cave, would you?
True.
Well, perhaps a big boulder would do the trick.
Or perhaps...
- Quick!
Hide!
- Woo!
What are you doing?
- I've just seen Alistair.
- Oh!
Lionel, we're grown-ups.
- We can't just hide behind a tree.
- Yes, we can.
I just wanted a nice quiet Saturday to myself, with you.
Well, where was Alistair?
- Back there somewhere.
- I know he's there somewhere.
Otherwise we wouldn't be on this side.
Can't you be more precise?
- What do you want, a map reference?
- Look, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Did he see you?
If he'd seen us, there'd be no point in us hiding.
Oh.
No.
- Shall I have a peep?
- No!
Oh!
Don't pull me about!
I'm sorry but just stay put.
Well, what happens if he walks past?
Do we just hope he doesn't turn round, or do we edge round to the back of the tree?
- You're making very light of this.
- Well, it's hard to take seriously, isn't it?
He could have turned round.
- I'm going to have a peep.
- No!
- Boo!
- Oh!
Now, why should you two be hiding from me?
- We weren't hiding at all.
- No.
- No, just erm...
leaning against the tree.
- Tree, yes.
Canoodling.
Canoodling!
What a great old expression that was.
Is.
What a great old expression that is.
Now, you may be surprised that we bumped into each other in a park.
We wouldn't be surprised if we bumped into you in the Kalahari Desert.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I belled Judy and she told me where you were.
And do I have news!
I assume that's a rhetorical question.
- Li, you're scowling.
- I feel like scowling.
Well, let's go and find somewhere to sit, I'll tell you my news, and your face will be wreathed in smiles.
Let's go!
Yes, I'll say this for Alistair: he's an optimist.
You're still scowling, Li.
- It's my face.
- It's not medieval, you know.
- I never said it was.
- No, not Lionel's face,
- I mean the verb, canoodle.
- I didn't mean to imply it was.
I have to say to you both that this is not one of your more receptive days.
- You haven't given us anything to receive yet.
- Then try this.
Mike Barbosa stepped off a plane this morning.
Is it too much to hope that it was in midair at the time?
From Los Angeles.
And he wants a little meet.
- Shall we do the joke, or not?
- Let's just hear the rest.
- Why?
- To bring you some great news!
- Can't you tell me?
- I don't know what it is.
- Then how do you know it's great?
- Because Mike flew in especially to see you.
Well, that's a step forward, Lionel.
Last time, he fitted you in between buying socks.
I've had a whiz round.
- Is there anything else?
- No, thanks, I'm in good order.
It's damn cheek, Mike Barbosa inviting himself to tea.
Oh, now, be fair, he invited us to tea at The Savoy, but you made it sound like an expedition to the South Pole.
I see he gets the best cups and saucers, as well.
Now, what is it about Americans that brings out the worst in you?
I've nothing against Americans as such.
It's Americans who are in television.
They're all hoo-hah.
- Hoo-hah?
- Yes.
Don't forget that this particular American has a lot to do with your miniseries being seen on the screen.
I hope he doesn't ask how the Queen is again.
That wasn't Mike, it was Cy.
Who's now in a loony bin.
That bodes well, doesn't it?
- Who replaced Cy?
- Sol.
- A model of mental stability, I might add.
- You've never met the man.
I'm taking a leaf out of Alistair's book, being optimistic.
Ooh!
That's probably them.
Now, big smile, now.
That won't do.
Think of canoodling.
Go on!
This is really nice.
English tea in an English home.
Lionel, you have a beautiful place here.
It isn't mine, it's Jean's.
Another cucumber sandwich?
No, thank you, Jean.
I'm watching my starch intake.
Aren't we all?
So...
Mike, you were saying how much Sol liked the first episode.
He described himself as "enraptured".
- He's not in therapy, is he?
- Sol?
Ha!
Sol is one of the best-balanced guys I know.
I mean, this is a man who finds time to play with the kids from his first three marriages.
Does "enraptured" mean he wants the whole thing rewritten?
There goes Lionel with the jokes again.
Lionel, you have my word.
But the script just needs a little fine-tuning, which Manny can handle in LA.
- Who's Manny?
- Sol's brother-in-law, but a distinguished writer in his own right.
This fine-tuning, it's not a major service, is it?
Tiny, tiny alterations.
We just have to make your England a little more acceptable to Middle America.
Which brings us to the real reason for Mike's visit.
It is socks again?
Locations.
Mike is already looking for locations, and does he have a great idea!
Yes, do I have a great idea?
Well, we shall never know if you don't tell us.
Lionel, do you remember your dad's house?
Of course I remember my dad's house.
I would just love to see that house.
It sounds perfect to serve as your birthplace.
It was my birthplace!
- Great!
- I'm not sure Lionel's father and his wife would like a film crew trampling all over the house.
They lead very quiet lives down there.
Almost monastic.
- Rocky and Madge?
- Yes.
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, I just want to see the place.
Well, you could write, Lionel.
Or we could get really modern.
Oh, all right.
By the way, Jean, I thought that love scene was just beautiful.
Oh, good.
I helped Lionel write that, in bed.
Hello, Father, it's Lionel.
Who?
Your son.
What is that din?
Madge is on the drums.
Hold it a minute, dear, will you?
I'm trying to get my lick right.
She's trying to get her lick right.
Ah!
Now, what were you saying?
Look, I have a Mr Barbosa here, he'd like to see the house sometime.
- We're not open to the public.
- I know that.
He may want to use it in the miniseries.
- What as?
- A house, of course.
He may want to do some filming there.
- Somebody wants us to be in a film!
- Oh, how exciting!
When does he want to come down?
Well, that's the thing, you see.
I mean, it's probably inconvenient, and if you don't fancy the idea at all...
Don't fancy it?
We'd love it!
Bring him down for lunch tomorrow, eh?
Oh.
Oh, jolly good.
Right.
Erm, bye, Father.
Cheerio, and give your cutie a kiss from me.
Erm, would tomorrow be too soon?
- Perfect!
- Terrif!
Oh, and he sent my cutie a kiss.
Cutie?
Oh!
So much for a quiet weekend.
It's rather exciting, though, isn't it?
I mean, we shall see it being filmed.
- Surprised Mike didn't ask Buckingham Palace.
- Oh, he did, but they turned him down.
Oh, no.
No, no, those mustn't go in there.
- Well, they do in the commercials.
- Yes, but this is real life.
Just give them here.
There you are.
No, don't do this.
- Just go and sit down.
- I don't want to, I want to be alone with you.
Huh!
That's an odd thing to say over the sink, but I like the thought.
- This fine-tuning that Mike mentioned...
- I asked him about that.
- Tiny, tiny alterations is what he said.
- Written by somebody's brother-in-law.
Being a brother-in-law doesn't disqualify you from writing.
Just so long as they don't make us do ridiculous things.
Like hiding behind trees?
That was an act of desperation.
Your heart has never really been in this, has it?
I'd never have considered it if it hadn't been for the money.
Spoken like a true artist.
And when it's all over, what do I do then?
- Then you write your Oscar acceptance speech.
- This is for television.
Oh, OK, if you want to nit-pick.
Look on the bright side.
If this is a smash, you'll be picked up.
- By whom?
- Not young starlets, if that's what you hope.
Film companies, television companies.
You could be hot property.
- Or a condemned building.
- Oh...
What was that for?
Well, for being, as Rocky says, such a dismal Jimmy.
Why all this talk about afterwards?
You don't have to do anything afterwards.
- Just lounge about?
- If that's what you want to do.
We're all right financially.
Oh, yes, as long as I send you out to work.
You don't send me out to work, I enjoy it.
You make it sound as if I scrub doorsteps for a living.
- You don't see things the way I do.
- Well, just as well, the mood you're in.
I'm not in a mood, I'm just... concerned, that's all.
Well, you don't need to be.
That's the point.
I do, because...
Because what?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all, really.
Driver!
Hold it there!
Alistair, it's magnificent!
- Not bad, is it?
- I love it!
I love it, Lionel!
- Good.
- Let's drive on up there.
This isn't Los Angeles.
We could walk the full 20 yards.
Hey, that's a great idea!
Let's walk!
- Did you fall asleep in there?
- No, it's this chair.
I kind of slumped into it.
You look about three feet tall!
Well, would you mind just giving me a hand?
- Sorry, yes.
- Oh!
Oh!
Dignity.
Always dignity.
Oh!
Hello, Mrs Bale.
How are things in the English Channel?
Calm as a millpond.
How nice to see you again, Miss Pargetter.
- Hello, Mrs Bale.
You've met Alistair?
- Still on the tequila sunrises, Mrs Bale?
I've moved on to Black Russians.
And this is Mr Barbosa, an associate of mine.
Mike, this is Mrs Bale, my father's housekeeper.
Mike?
That face!
That face!
- What's wrong with my face?
- Wrong?
Wrong!
It's...
It's incredible!
It's...
Plantagenet!
Alistair... would you look at this hall!
It's going to be a long day.
Are Madge and Rocky at home?
I expect them back shortly.
They went to the leisure centre.
I shouldn't have asked.
What are we going to drink to?
What are we going to drink to, Madge?
- The future, what else?
- The future!
You...
You've hit the spot again, Mrs Bale.
One tries.
- Where have the boys gone?
- Boys?
Alistair was showing Mike round.
Mike was running upstairs shouting, "Perfect!
Perfect!"
Oh, I like Mike.
He's exuberant.
I wonder if he'd like a crack on my drums?
This business of filming in the house, if Mike decides to, have you really thought it through?
I can't be doing, thinking things through.
It takes forever!
Quite right.
Go with the flow!
Lunch will be served at 1:24.
Is that relevant, Mrs Bale?
Unless you all want to go hungry, yes.
Now, what do you think, Jean Pargetter?
It is Plantagenet.
No, I mean about this filming lark.
Oh.
You understand that Mike wants to film the house?
I don't think he'd offer you parts.
Perhaps that's just as well.
We'd probably crack his lens.
- And then there's the lolly!
- What lolly?
Oh, come on, my boy, we wouldn't say yes just to cement Anglo-American relations.
We're talking bucks.
- Yes, greenbacks.
- You're not silly, you two, are you?
Only when we're having fun!
Are you all right, Mrs Bale?
I'm afraid lunch will be postponed until 1:47.
I have been unnerved.
- A change of weather in the Channel?
- No.
Mr Barbosa.
He wants to use me.
In what sense?
He wants me to be in the film.
He wants me to play Mr Lionel's nanny.
- I didn't have a nanny!
- So I told him, but he kept saying, "I must use that face."
Oh, rock on, I say.
Yes, fame beckons, Mrs Bale.
Just a minute, what's a nanny doing in it?
There's no nanny in my script.
There is, according to Mr Barbosa, in your childhood scenes.
What childhood scenes?
- Sounds like the brother-in-law's fine-tuning.
- Yes.
Well, we'll see about that!
He always did fly off the handle, that boy.
I'm sorry I mentioned it now.
I must get on with lunch, or it will drag on till 1:57.
I'd better find Lionel before blood is spilt.
I don't see what all the fuss is about.
I mean, nobody takes television seriously.
It's only pretend.
If Lionel punches Mike on the nose, it won't be.
Of all the crackbrained, half-witted ideas.
Just Two People, it's called.
Just two grown-up people.
My childhood is an irrelevance.
Li, cool it, please.
We were all children once.
That's a profound statement, if ever I heard one.
I want to talk to Mike.
Where is he?
He's...
He's wandering about somewhere.
Look, Li, we do not need alienation.
I don't care what we need, I want to talk to him.
- Hey...
Lovely lady.
- Will you stop calling her that?
Jean, could you please keep at least one of Lionel's feet on the ground?
Not if he's hopping mad.
- Very funny.
- Mind you, he has a right to be.
Somebody's brother-in-law sticking in extra scenes, it's not fair.
I suppose he's also got a scene of me taking part in Trooping The Colour.
- He has, hasn't he?
- Look, Li, these things are open to debate.
Then find Mike, and let's debate.
After lunch, though.
It's never wise to debate on an empty stomach.
Who told you that?
Benjamin Disraeli?
Hey, you guys!
- Mike?
- Up here!
Look, there he is, there he is.
I'm in the attic.
It's unbelievable!
- Pardon?
- The attic, it's unbelievable!
I can't hear you.
Could you lean out a bit more?
Don't you see, Lionel?
This bit of back story, it adds colour.
- It adds, um...
- Poignancy.
Poignancy, poignancy.
We get to see the little boy who became the man.
What about the little girl who became the woman?
What a great idea!
We could get to meet the young Jean, in an orphanage.
- Orphanage?
- That just came to me, out of left-field.
Pity you didn't leave it there.
I'm still bothered about the fox-hunting.
Rocky, it's so British, it's so colourful.
- It's so cruel.
- What about a paper chase?
- No, thanks, I'm full up.
- What I meant is instead of the fox-hunting.
- With the boy Lionel as the hare, you mean?
- Could be, could be.
- I never liked running.
- Oh, go on.
I could watch from the orphanage window!
Jean, that was only an idea.
And as soppy as the rest of them.
- I did think the Christmas party sounded fun.
- Madge, it would tear at the heartstrings.
Especially interspersed with my scene at the orphanage with my pathetic rag doll.
- I don't understand all this servant business.
- Tradition.
All the servants line up to present the young Lionel with their touching Christmas gifts.
But we didn't have servants.
All we had was old Mrs Twillet.
She came in to do, twice a week.
- Let's remember poetic licence.
- Poetic claptrap!
- I'd like to say something.
- Shoot, Mrs Bale.
Mr Barbosa, I have considered your offer, but have decided not to play Nanny.
It wasn't actually an offer.
You see, I lead a quiet life, and I rather like it that way.
Having your handprints in cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater may be some people's idea of enjoyment, but I'm far happier with a good book and the Shipping Forecast.
Alistair?
Probably a wise decision on the whole, Mrs Bale.
I think so.
But I am rather pleased to learn that I have a Plantagenet face.
- OK, where were we?
- Lionel had just said, "Claptrap!"
The most restrained expression I could use, in mixed company.
Oh, I don't mind a good swear!
She's been known to turn the air blue herself, has Madge.
Who's going to start the swearing off?
People, please!
I'm beginning to feel outnumbered here.
I do stress, these are only tentative suggestions.
If they stay that way, fine.
But I won't agree to scenes that depict me as Little Lord Fauntleroy and Jean as Little Orphan Annie.
Would you excuse us?
Does Lionel have final script approval?
- Of course not.
- Excellent!
Believe me, Lionel, I've taken your criticisms on board and I shall straighten out Manny as soon as I get to LA.
- Thank you.
- And not a nose punched.
I've got a bit lost.
Now, does this mean that you are going to be filming the old place or not?
Sir, I think this house is a dream location.
We shall be talking to you.
- We don't come cheap.
- We don't pay cheap.
Well, that sounds jolly good!
- Now, come on, who's for a game of pool?
- Oh, I'm on.
I'd love to, but Alistair and I have to go to Edinburgh, Scotland.
Yes, we have to see a man who knows a man, you know...
- Can we give you a lift to town?
- That's very kind, but Lionel and I are going to make love this afternoon.
Good.
Um...
How very...
Well, we'll catch you later.
We'll see you out.
Yes.
Tell me, Mike, this limo of yours, is it a souped-up job?
Hey, hey!
You two.
Woof!
Now, why one earth did you say that?
I didn't want to get stuck in the car seat again.
I said the first thing that came into my head.
Well, you really must stop saying things like that.
- Well, "a snooze in the garden" sounds dull.
- Yes, true.
- Well, shall we?
- Shall we what?
Well, have a snooze in the garden.
Yes, OK.
- It's lovely here.
- Yes, it is.
We should be making a move soon.
We're welcome to stay.
Madge and Rocky said so.
I know.
But they're having some friends round, and that'll degenerate into a country and western evening.
We'll make a move soon.
Ah, here they are.
You know, you amaze me, you young people.
You seem to do nothing but sprawl about.
- What have you two been doing?
- Playing croquet.
The vicious variety.
Yes, but I'm glad we caught you.
We wanted a word.
- Rocky, what are you doing?
- Ordering a round of drinks.
Oh, don't worry, it's only a starter's pistol.
It's much more civil than shouting, don't you think?
Well, come on, Mrs Bale, let's be hearing from you.
She enjoys it too, you know.
- Now, where was I?
- Having a word.
Ah, yes.
Yes, of course.
Where shall I start, Madge?
No shilly-shallying, plunge straight in.
Quite right, of course.
Lionel, my boy, we want you to have the house.
Oh, don't gawp dear.
It doesn't suit you.
I simply...
Why do you want to give me the house?
Well, we haven't gone peculiar, if that's what you're implying.
No...
Lionel's just shocked.
People don't give away houses every day, do they?
No, I suppose not, but, anyway, it makes very good sense.
You see, Madge and I are mostly globe-trotting at the moment.
We're hardly ever here.
As a matter of fact, we're off to Lithuania on Wednesday.
- I didn't know anyone went to Lithuania.
- That's why we're going.
Look here, you can't just give me a house!
I can do anything I damn well like!
It would have come to you eventually, anyhow.
- What about Madge?
- Oh, don't worry about me.
I've got the cottage.
Rocky and I will use that as a base.
- I just don't know what to say.
- I do.
- What happens to Mrs Bale?
- We shan't have her put down!
She can look after the cottage for us, and if you needed help out here, just fire a starter's pistol.
We'll have to refine this signalling system.
One shot doesn't signify which drink you require.
I'm quite good at archery.
What about arrows with messages on?
- Well, we shall see.
- We've told the young 'uns the good news.
And have our thank yous been said?
I'm still recovering.
I'm very grateful, Dad.
Oh, stuff and nonsense!
You're a bit on the serious side for my liking, but I'm really quite fond of you.
I think you're dear people.
Both of you.
Just give us a few weeks to clear out our junk, and it's all yours.
We don't expect you to live in it all the time, of course, but it'll do for weekends and so on, won't it?
- Do?
- Do?
I always said he'd find the right girl.
- Took him long enough.
- Hark who's talking!
Now, you will be kind to your vassals and serfs, won't you?
- What?
- Vassals and serfs.
- What vassals and serfs?
- Ha!
It doesn't matter.
Drink your drink.
Thanks.
Do you think Mike will tell Manny to forget all that Merry England stuff?
- Do you know something?
I don't care.
- Oh, I wish you meant that.
I do, I really do.
I'll write the second episode, they'll mangle it, and I don't care.
They can turn it into a musical as far as I'm concerned.
Oh!
#Just two people
I'm writing the opening number.
Are we alone?
Er...
Unless there's somebody under the sofa, yes.
- I meant Judith or Sandy.
- Yes, I know you did.
Yes, they left a note on the fridge:
"Painting the town."
- I'm glad.
- You're getting very liberal.
- I mean, I'm glad they're out.
- Mm.
So am I. At last we've got a bit of weekend to ourselves.
- That was very well timed.
- I didn't know you were going to lean on me.
- I wasn't going to lean, just snuggle up.
- No, that would get in the way at the moment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- The way of what?
- Well...
All this should have happened all those years ago.
Your letter would have reached me in Korea and I would have come home, and...
Well, actually, I'd have done this.
Ooh!
But my knee wouldn't have clicked then.
- Yes.
- No, it wouldn't.
Yes, I will marry you.
- Well, I haven't asked you yet.
- But you were going to, weren't you?
Yes, but I'd sooner actually say it, if it's all the same to you.
Sorry.
- Are you all right down there?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Now, you may...
Thank you.
You may think that I've taken a long while getting around to this.
- Yes!
- What?
No.
- There is a reason.
- Cold feet?
- May I finish, or not?
- Sorry, sorry.
I didn't really have anything to offer you.
I mean, dribs and drabs of money from the book, the odd lecture.
I mean, the television money, that's fine, but it won't last forever.
But now, with a house, I can offer you something proper, something real.
That's why you were going on about the money.
It probably sounds stupid, but that's the way I am.
No, it's not stupid.
And there's something else.
- Oh, is there?
- Yes.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
And I don't think I've ever stopped loving you.
Well, that's it, really.
- I love you, too.
- Well, that's good.
- Can I say yes now?
- Yes, please.
Yes.
There's always something, isn't there?
- What is it?
- My knee's locked!
It doesn't matter.
# You must remember this
# A kiss is still a kiss
# A sigh is just a sigh
# The fundamental things apply
# As time goes by
# And when two lovers woo
# They still say I love you
# On that you can rely
# The world will always welcome lovers
# As time goes by #
Hurry up, old woman.
His Majesty hasn't got all night.
Patience, Nemos.
The future has all the time in the world.
Almighty Zeus.
Grace me with the vision of your all-seeing eyes.
Well, what do they say ?
There is truth to your dreams, your Lordship.
There is, indeed, a child in your future.
You're reading the past, woman.
My son died in childbirth, months ago.
Apologies, my Lord, but this child is not of your line.
He is an orphan, of humble parentage, born on the equinox.
He is a child in your possession.
Such an infant was born to one of your servants.
The mother died in childbirth.
Then, what of this child ?
It is... puzzling, my Lord.
I only speak the vision.
No one is going to blame you for your gift.
What is it ?
The child will one day occupy the throne...
Your throne, my Lord.
- Why, that's ridiculous !
- The stones do not lie.
What is it, then ?
Will he attempt to take the throne by force ?
Will he grow to lead an army ?
What is it ?
I cannot read that.
But whatever it is, his birth has set the course of events in motion.
Thoughts, advisor ?
We're talking about a mere infant.
Threats to the crown take on many guises.
You promised his mother on her death-bed that you'd care for him as your own, did you not ?
You know I did, but...
But then, listen to me, Philana.
The child is in grave danger.
The king's advisor, Nemos, is hunting for him.
Put him in the basket.
May the gods protect you, child.
Hey, sleepy-head.
Wake up.
Good morning.
Did you sleep OK ?
Like a rock.
You ?
On a rock.
I kept trying to find that one patch of ground that didn't have a boulder on it.
What's that ?
Is that a cat ?
A big cat ?
Or, or, or a griffen, yeah.
A big griffen with a cat in its mouth.
Maybe not.
What is it ?
Well, it's not a cat or a griffen.
In a time of ancient gods warlords and kings...
A land in turmoil cried out for a hero...
She was Xena... a mighty princess, forged in the heat of battle The power The passion The danger...
Her courage will change the world...
You're just the most precious little thing.
Yes, you are.
Xena, can we keep him ?
It is a him, isn't it ?
Oh, I always wanted a little brother.
He belongs with his mother.
Well, whoever she is, she obviously doesn't want him.
I mean, imagine sending a baby down a river.
Maybe she had a reason.
Well, I guess we should find out.
Why's he crying ?
Are you holding him wrong, or something ?
No, maybe he's hungry.
He must have come from that village upriver.
We'll get him something to eat there, and find out who he belongs to.
What should we call him ?
I mean, until we find his mother.
You know, Gabriel's a nice name.
Then of course, Xenos is good, too.
I miss you so, my love.
- Any news ?
- None, my Lord.
But we have just begun our search.
The child will be found, don't worry.
Perhaps, we should let things be.
I mean, do we dare tamper with fate ?
I believe that fate is just an excuse for men with no destiny.
You, my Lord, are destined for greatness.
And I would hate to see that threatened by the hand of a child.
When the child is an adult, with a dagger to my throat, then I'll view him as a threat.
- For now...
- I would agree with you, my Lord, except word of the prophecy has already reached the outer villages.
There are some who already consider him your successor.
And if the child were to fall into the wrong hands...
The people can't afford another civil war, Nemos.
You brought us through the last one, my Lord.
How many lives were saved through your leadership ?
And how many lives are at stake, should the child remain free ?
It's been six months since she died, taking my son with her.
This child...
My command is unchanged.
Bring him to me...
I'll decide what to do once I have him.
That's it !
Tie it tighter !
Watch your hands !
I take it you're in charge.
It's that obvious ?
In my experience, cowardly mobs are usually led by weasles.
What's this woman done ?
Send her to Hades.
Finish her off !
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to turn your back on a lady ?
Any volunteers to replace him ?
I didn't think so.
Are you all right ?
I'm fine.
You're fine ?
Did I just miss something ?
They were going to kill you.
Yes.
I think they were.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Here, I'll get this.
- No, no wait, please.
Just, be careful with that bag.
It's all right...
I've got it.
We better get this baby to shelter.
This'll have to do till the storm passes.
Good.
Wait !
I was only trying to help.
Does that box have anything to do with what those people wanted ?
In a way.
But it was me they were after.
After you, because...
Because I was born into the wrong family, and I'm paying for it now.
- My name is Pandora.
- Pandora...
- the one who opened the box ?
- No, that was my grandmother.
We have the same name, but, yes, I still carry...
The box.
The box !
No, don't, don't, please...
Don't worry.
It can't hurt you.
If you know the story, you'll remember, all the desires of mortals were released when my grandmother opened it.
Except the hope of mankind.
Yes... the hope of mankind is the one thing my grandmother managed to trap.
That's why we all still have hope.
It's the rest of man's desires that are fleeting.
Like what ?
That's all right.
This box is the most important thing in my life.
It's why I can't live my life.
Gabrielle...
Give the baby to Pandora and come help me here.
Ah, Look, I'm not really the best one to be trusted with a baby.
Just... hold your arms out.
Make sure you hold his head up.
What do you need ?
Get me my saddlebag.
For that you needed me ?
Don't even think about it.
We do not rest until the infant is found.
But remember, he needn't necessarily be found alive.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You'll have to check your weapons.
We just want some milk and some port.
Weapons first, then milk.
Go ahead and sit down.
He's cute, isn't he ?
I'd like to say he has my nose.
What can I say ?
He does.
Get Nemos.
- Can you hold him ?
- Yes.
And hurry.
Gabriel.
We're looking for the mother of this baby.
I'm an innkeeper, that's all I know.
That'll be six dinars.
Oh, yes, hello.
Something about our baby bothering you ?
No, no, I got work to do.
Keep moving.
By the order of King Gregor, that child is under arrest.
Give me that child.
No, no, don't be afraid, little one.
Better do like he says.
Get behind the bar.
- The box !
- Come on !
Get the baby !
Get down !
Give me that baby !
Pandora...
Get down !
Surrender now, and I'll spare your life.
I was about to say the same to you.
Get her !
You all right ?
Yeah.
What ?
What do you want with me ?
You sent the boy after them.
I notice things like that.
That weak feeling is the blood to your brain being cut off.
You'll be dead in less than a minute.
Or we could talk.
Let's talk.
You're smarter than you look.
Now, who's Gregor, and what's all this about ?
King Gregor.
The baby belongs to one of his servants.
What does he want with him ?
He's not gonna hurt him, is he ?
I don't know.
OK, OK
An oracle told him that, one day, the baby would take his throne.
The word's out that he wants him killed.
No !
What's wrong ?
The box is gone.
It's worse than we imagined.
Xena is involved.
The Warrior Princess has the child, and more than that, she has Pandora.
I was barely able to escape with the box.
You were lucky to escape with your life.
I fear the day I might have to go up against her army.
So... this is it.
Ah, my Lord, that design might trigger the latch.
I'm not gonna open it, Nemos.
No man in his right mind would.
But a Warrior Princess might.
Or at least, use it to blackmail a king.
- You think that was her intent ?
- She has the child, she had the box.
What else am I to think ?
She has conquered larger kingdoms with weapons less than this.
We have sent men into the outlying villages, and cut off all escape through the mountains here.
These areas are secured, so we know they must be somewhere near here... the peasant area.
Of course, this is all useless.
We know the solution... it's just...
too horrendous to consider.
I'm afraid, I don't see your solution.
The child...
I can't believe I'm going to suggest this...
The child must be killed... as soon as possible.
I am to order the death of a child ?
No... but you are to order the life and prosperity of your people.
This child is already dead.
Do you think Xena cares about its well-being ?
And if it lives, it'll just become a pawn in the battle for the crown.
It has no life, and neither will your people, so long as it remains a threat.
- You have a plan ?
- I have two plans.
I have sent out agents with a reward for the baby's capture.
If they choose to live among the peasants, we'll get the peasants to work for us.
- And the other ?
- We trade Xena... the box for the baby.
None of these ideas please me.
What is it ?
It seems our warrior friend is one step ahead of us.
She wants to meet you.
Gregor agreed to meet with us.
Good...
I want to look into this man's eyes.
And he's not meeting us...
I'm going alone.
Whatever.
But I want you to know,
I managed to get some milk for this baby, and it wasn't easy.
You know, there's a reward out for us ?
The word has it, it's over a thousand dinars.
I'm tempted to turn myself in.
What's wrong with Pandora ?
She's been like that ever since the tavern.
I think it's the first time she's been without that box.
Pandora, are you all right ?
I have to get it back.
You will.
First, we make sure the baby's safe, and then...
It'll take too long.
I made the wrong choice...
I should have grabbed the box.
You made the only choice.
Gregor's not stupid enough to open the box.
It doesn't matter how stupid he is.
You don't understand...
If I don't have that box in my possession, it opens itself.
See, that's the curse of my family, that's why we must always carry the box.
I am the only one who can reset the lock.
And if I don't have the box before midnight, it opens, and hope escapes.
I guess I can't expect someone like Xena to be on time.
And she has nothing but contempt for you, my Lord.
Are you alone, my Lords ?
Or shall I prepare a drink for your guards ?
Just the two of us.
Ale for the king.
Only two ?
Only two ?
Is there something wrong with my voice ?
I wanted to make sure this little party was just between us.
Do sit down.
Where is the child ?
Safe, and non-negotiable.
That's not why we're here.
Then, we have nothing further to discuss...
Then why are we here ?
I wanted to look into your eyes...
To see what sort of man would order the death of a defenseless child.
I could order your death right here and now.
Under a flag of truce ?
Then I would know what kind of a man you are.
What would a flag of truce mean to a cold-blooded murderer ?
I know who you are.
And you disgust me.
You swept across countless nations, and saw the world tremble at your feet.
But my people are not gonna be your next victims.
If it means my death, or the death of this... child, so be it.
The answer is simple...
We have the box.
We know you want it.
You have the child.
We want him.
Did you bring the box ?
Did you bring the child ?
I didn't think so.
He can't hurt you, Gregor.
He's just an infant.
That's right...
He's just one infant.
And surely his life doesn't compare to losing the hope of mankind.
You're not mad enough to open the box.
24 hours to make your decision.
- Who's this ?
- Ophelia.
She works as a servant in the castle.
I was the one who put the baby into the river.
Is he safe ?
Pandora ?
Oh, yes.
I brought him some blankets and some food.
Where did you find her ?
Hey, you fight, I talk.
We each have our gifts.
You wanted me to scout a way into the castle ?
She's the way.
Good work.
So, how'd it go with Gregor ?
Is he the worm's tongue we thought he'd be ?
- No, he's not.
- He's not ?
I looked into this man's eyes, and I didn't see an evil man.
I saw a king trying to protect his people from a cold-blooded murderer...
His words.
You see, an evil man wouldn't have cared.
- Did you tell him about the box opening ?
- No, I almost did.
But that advisor of his...
Nemos ?
...
I don't trust him.
Knowledge is power, and I didn't want to give him that power.
Ophelia ?
Gregor has a wooden box, with a palm design on it ?
I've seen it.
Nemos either keeps it in his room or under close guard.
I need to get into the castle.
Can you help ?
Yes, but not tonight.
- It has to be tonight.
- No...
The quartermoon festival is tonight.
There's too many people there.
What happens at this festival ?
Eating and drinking.
Then Nemos has several of the servant-women dance for him, and he chooses one.
Are you one of the dancers ?
What time do you have to be there ?
I haven't got the baby anywhere.
Stay away from my cart.
I am warning you.
I heard a baby cry.
I swear it came from here.
It's the grease.
Haven't you ever heard grease sizzle ?
Look at these people.
They've gone crazy trying to find the baby.
They're scared, or greedy.
Maybe a little of both.
This way.
This should be close enough.
Throw me.
That's true.
Come on, come on.
Dancers !
My Lord.
Please, join us.
The search goes on, and things are well in hand.
What is this doing here ?
I feel much safer if I know where it is.
And I would think we have enough men here to protect it, if need be.
I think it'll be better protected with me.
I'm beginning to believe His Majesty is becoming distracted by his moral convictions.
Gather as many men loyal to me as you can.
I wanna have a strong hand in case our king suffers a temporary loss of judgment.
But first we deal with the Warrior Princess.
You !
Come here.
Have her brought to my room.
Gabriel, Shhh !
He's going to give us away.
You have a knack for this kind of thing.
He likes you.
Really ?
Yeah.
Have you ever thought about having a baby ?
No...
I can't afford to dream about something that'll never be.
Now, I feel as if I know too much.
But I wouldn't trade it for anything.
You know, I wouldn't.
Don't be afraid, my child.
My desire is pleasure, not pain.
My pleasure is yours, my Lord.
I merely want to take your responsibilities from you...
At least for one evening.
I'm surprised you have time to take from your work...
Or the king.
Is he working tonight ?
He's in his chamber.
Oh, you smell so good.
You mean, I'm actually near the royal chamber.
Just down the hallway.
But enough of him.
You spoke of pleasure.
And you spoke of pain.
My boy, my only son.
What's become of your father, child ?
The man your mother called husband.
I would have valued your life greater than my own.
And now another child's life is in my hands.
Why were you taken from me ?
The box.
Guards !
That warrior woman is loose !
Search the room !
You two, come with me !
Breakitdown!
Break it down !
Break it down !
Well, Xena
You've made this far easier than I expected.
Hand me the box, and maybe I'll let you live.
You have no options, be certain of that.
There are many things I'm not certain of, Nemos, but I'll bet my life this'll surprise you.
Sorry !
Come here.
We've got the baby, we've got the box.
Let's get out of here.
No, not yet.
There's still the prophecy.
What do you mean ?
The prophecy's fulfilled if the baby lives.
- He'll grow up to take the kingdom.
- That's right.
That's why I have to give the baby to Gregor.
Don't be alarmed.
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.
What is it you want ?
To fulfill the prophecy.
You wanna take my throne.
I have no interest in your throne.
I never have.
You're a good man, Gregor, and a good ruler.
I know about your wife and child.
Think, Gregor.
This child will take your throne, but as your heir, not as your conqueror.
He's a child who needs a father to love him.
You're a father who needs a child to love.
That's the prophecy.
I was so blind.
I think it's time my people met their next king.
Have you lost your mind ?
I've come to my senses.
You're being seduced, it's a trick.
- Hand me that baby.
- I command you to return to your room.
What I do, I do for the betterment of this kingdom.
No, you don't !
Out of my way !
- It's her !
- She's got the baby !
- Here, Gabrielle !
- Don't !
No, no, no !
Xena, catch !
Gabrielle, the baby !
Oh, no !
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
Any warrior would have done that.
What makes you think I'm not going to.
I feel a little nervous, just letting it out of my sight.
Don't you worry.
As long as I... or my son... rule, the box will be safe in my fortress.
The room is well protected.
Well, I'll still reset the lock every day.
But I won't have to wander anymore.
I think I finally have a home.
The child needs a mother.
Even as a king, I can't handle it alone.
You brought the prophecy true, Xena.
How can I ever repay you ?
I didn't do it for payment.
Have a good life, all three of you.
Isn't there anything you want ?
Name him Gabriel.
You ready to go ?
Sure.
I can't believe I touched the box.
Pandora's grandmother was cursed because of this.
And then Pandora is blessed because of it.
Does it all happen because of fate ?
Or is it just chance ?
I think it all happened 'cause you slept on a rock.
It did, didn't it ?
All right, let's go.
There's nothing in it.
All these years, she's been carrying around an empty box.
The box was empty, but Pandora was still carrying our hope.
What should we tell her ?
We tell her the truth.
Hope has been and always will be safe.
It's inside every one of us.
No Babies were harmed during the production of this motion picture.
Hurry up, old woman.
His Majesty hasn't got all night.
Patience, Nemos.
The future has all the time in the world.
Almighty Zeus!

Hey, sleepy-head, wake up.
Good morning.
Did you sleep ok?
Like a rock.
You?
On a rock.
I kept trying to find that one patch of ground that didn't have a boulder on it.
What's that?
Is that a cat?
A big cat?
Or, or a griffen, yeah.
A big griffen with a cat in its mouth!
Maybe not.
What is it?
Well, it's not a cat or a griffen.
In the time of ancient gods..., warlords and kings, a land in turmoil cried out for a hero.
She was Xena.
A mighty princess forged in the heat of battle.
The power.
The passion.
The danger.
Her courage will change the world.
XENA
- WARRIOR PRINCESS
You're just the most precious little thing!
Yes, you are.
Xena, can we keep him?
It is a him, isn't it?
I always wanted a little brother.
He belongs with his mother.
Well...
Whoever she is, she obviously doesn't want him.
I mean...
Imagine sending a baby down a river!
Maybe she had a reason.
Well, I guess we should find out.
Why's he crying?
Are you holding him wrong or something?
No!
Maybe... he's hungry.
He must have come from that village upriver.
We'll get him something to eat there, and find out who he belongs to.
What should we call him?
I mean, until we find his mother.
You know, Gabriel's a nice name.
And, of course, Xeno is good too.
I miss you so, my love.
-Any news?
-None, my lord.
But we have just begun our search.
The child will be found, don't worry.
Perhaps we should let things be.
I mean, do we dare tamper with fate?
I believe that fate is just an excuse for men with no destiny.
You, my lord, are destined for greatness.
And I would hate to see that threatened by the hand of a child.
When the child is an adult, with a dagger to my throat then I'll view him as a threat.
-For now...
-I would agree with you, my lord..., ...except word of the prophecy has already reached the outer villages.
There are some who already consider him your successor.
And if the child were to fall into the wrong hands...
The people can't afford another civil war, Nemos.
You brought us through the last one, my lord.
How many lives were saved through your leadership?
And how many lives are at stake, should the child remain free?
It's been six months since she died, taking my son with her.
This child...
My command is unchanged.
Bring him to me...
I'll decide what to do once I have him.
That's it!
Tie it tighter!
I take it you're in charge.
It's that obvious?
In my experience, cowardly mobs are usually led by weasles.
What's this woman done?
Send her to Hades.
Finish her off!
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to turn your back on a lady?
Any volunteers to replace him?
I didn't think so.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
You're fine?
Did I just miss something?
They were going to kill you!
Yes.
I think they were.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
-Here, I'll get this.
-No, no, wait, please.
Just be careful with that bag!
It's all right...
I've got it.
We better get this baby to shelter.
This'll have to do till the storm passes.
Good.
Wait!
I was only trying to help.
Does that box have anything to do with what those people wanted?
In a way.
But it was me they were after.
After you, because...
Because I was born into the wrong family and I'm paying for it now.
-My name is Pandora.
-Pandora...
-...
The one who opened the box?
-No, that was my grandmother.
We have the same name, but, yes, I still carry...
The box.
The box!
No, no!
Please.
Don't worry.
It can't hurt you.
If you know the story, you'll remember all the desires of mortals were released when my grandmother opened it.
Except the hope of mankind.
Yes.
The hope of mankind is the one thing my grandmother managed to trap.
That's why we all still have hope.
It's the rest of man's desires that are fleeting.
Like what?
-Gabrielle.
-That's all right.
This box is the most important thing in my life.
It's why I can't live my life.
Gabrielle.
Give the baby to Pandora, and come help me here.
Look, I'm not really the best one to be trusted with a baby.
Just hold your arms out.
Make sure you hold his head up.
What do you need?
Get me my saddlebag.
For that you needed me?
Don't even think about it.
We do not rest until the infant is found.
But remember...
He needn't necessarily be found alive.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You'll have to check your weapons.
We just want some milk and some port.
Weapons first, then milk.
Go ahead and sit down.
He's cute, isn't he?
I'd like to say he has my nose.
What can I say?
He does.
Get Nemos.
-Can you hold him?
-Yes.
...And hurry.
Gabriel.
We're looking for the mother of this baby.
I'm an innkeeper, that's all I know.
That'll be six dinars.
Oh, yes, hello.
Something about our baby bothering you?
No...
I got work to do.
Keep moving.
By the order of King Gregor, that child is under arrest.
Give me that child.
No, don't be afraid, little one.
Better do like he says.
Get behind the bar.
-The box!
-Come on!
Get the baby!
Get down!
Give me that baby!
Pandora, get down!
Surrender now, and I'll spare your life.
I was about to say the same to you.
Get her!
You all right?
Yeah.
What?
What do you want with me?
You sent the boy after them.
I notice things like that.
That weak feeling is the blood to your brain being cut off.
You'll be dead in less than a minute.
Or we could talk.
Let's talk.
You're smarter than you look.
Now, who's Gregor, and what's all this about?
King Gregor...
The baby belongs to one of his servants.
What does he want with him?
He's not gonna hurt him, is he?
I don't know.
Ok.
An oracle told him that one day the baby would take his throne.
The word's out that he wants him killed.
No!
What's wrong?
The box is gone.
It's worse than we imagined.
Xena is involved.
The Warrior Princess has the child.
And more than that, she has Pandora.
I was barely able to escape with the box.
Xena?
You were lucky to escape with your life.
I fear the day I might have to go up against her army.
So this is it.
My lord, that design might trigger the latch.
I'm not gonna open it, Nemos.
No man in his right mind would.
But a Warrior Princess might.
Or at least, use it to blackmail a king.
-You think that was her intent?
-She has the child.
She had the box.
What else am I to think?
She has conquered larger kingdoms with weapons less than this.
We have sent men into the outlying villages and cut off all escape through the mountains here.
These areas are secured...
So we know they must be somewhere near here the peasant area.
Of course, this is all useless.
We know the solution.
It's just...
too horrendous to consider.
I'm afraid I don't see your solution.
The child...
I can't believe I'm going to suggest this.
The child must be killed as soon as possible.
I am to order the death of a child?
No.
But you are to order the life and prosperity of your people.
This child is already dead.
Do you think Xena cares about its well-being?
And if it lives, it'll just become a pawn in the battle for the crown.
It has no life and neither will your people, so long as it remains a threat.
-You have a plan?
-I have two plans.
I have sent out agents with a reward for the baby's capture.
If they choose to live among the peasants, we'll get the peasants to work for us.
-And the other?
-We trade Xena the box for the baby.
None of these ideas please me.
What is it?
It seems our warrior friend is one step ahead of us.
She wants to meet you.
Gregor agreed to meet with us.
Good.
I want to look into this man's eyes.
-And he's not meeting us.
I'm going alone.
-But, ah...
Whatever.
But I want you to know...
I managed to get some milk for this baby, and it wasn't easy.
You know there's a reward out for us?
The word has it, it's over a thousand dinars.
I'm tempted to turn myself in.
What's wrong with Pandora?
She's been like that ever since the tavern.
I think it's the first time she's been without that box.
Pandora...
Are you all right?
I have to get it back.
You will.
First, we make sure the baby's safe, and then...
It'll take too long.
I made the wrong choice.
I should have grabbed the box.
You made the only choice.
Gregor's not stupid enough to open the box.
It doesn't matter how stupid he is.
You don't understand.
If I don't have that box in my possession, it opens itself.
See, that's the curse of my family, that's why we must always carry the box.
I am the only one who can reset the lock.
And if I don't have the box before midnight, it opens and hope escapes.
I guess I can't expect someone like Xena to be on time.
And she has nothing but contempt for you, my lord.
Are you alone, my lords?
Or shall I prepare a drink for your guards?
Just the two of us.
Ale for the king.
Only two?
Only two.
Is there something wrong with my voice?
I wanted to make sure this little party was just between us.
Do sit down.
Where is the child?
Safe and non-negotiable.
That's not why we're here.
-Then, we have nothing further to discuss.
-Then why are we here?
I wanted to look into your eyes.
To see what sort of man would order the death of a defenseless child.
I could order your death right here and now.
Under a flag of truce?
Then I would know what kind of a man you are.
What would a flag of truce mean to a cold-blooded murderer?
I know who you are.
And you disgust me.
You swept across countless nations, and saw the world tremble at your feet.
But my people are not gonna be your next victims.
If it means my death or the death of this... child so be it.
The answer is simple.
We have the box.
We know you want it.
You have the child.
We want him.
-Did you bring the box?
-Did you bring the child?
I didn't think so.
He can't hurt you, Gregor.
He's just an infant.
That's right.
He's just one infant.
And surely his life doesn't compare to losing the hope of mankind.
You're not mad enough to open the box.
24 hours to make your decision.
-Who's this?
-Ophelia.
-She works as a servant in the castle.
-I was the one who put the baby into the river.
Is he safe?
Pandora?
Oh, yes...
I brought him some blankets and some food.
Where did you find her?
Hey, you fight.
I talk.
We each have our gifts.
You wanted me to scout a way into the castle?
She's the way.
Good work.
So how'd it go with Gregor?
Is he the worm's tongue we thought he'd be?
-No, he's not.
-He's not?
I looked into this man's eyes, and I didn't see an evil man.
I saw a king trying to protect his people from a cold-blooded murderer...
His words.
You see, an evil man wouldn't have cared.
-Did you tell him about the box opening?
-No, I almost did.
But that advisor of his, Nemos I don't trust him.
Knowledge is power, and I didn't want to give him that power.
Ophelia?
Gregor has a wooden box, with a palm design on it?
I've seen it.
Nemos either keeps it in his room or under close guard.
I need to get into the castle.
Can you help?
Yes, but not tonight.
-It has to be tonight.
-No!
The quartermoon festival is tonight.
There's too many people there.
What happens at this festival?
Eating and drinking.
Then Nemos has several of the servant-women dance for him and he chooses one.
Are you one of the dancers?
What time do you have to be there?
I haven't got the baby anywhere!
Stay away from my cart, I am warning you!
I heard a baby cry.
I swear it came from here.
It's the grease.
Haven't you ever heard grease sizzle?
Look at these people.
They've gone crazy trying to find the baby.
They're scared, or greedy.
Maybe a little of both.
This way.
This should be close enough.
Throw me.
Come on, come on.
Dancers!
My lord!
Please, join us.
The search goes on and things are well in hand.
What is this doing here?
I feel much safer if I know where it is.
And I would think we have enough men here to protect it, if need be.
I think it'll be better protected with me.
I'm beginning to believe His Majesty is becoming distracted by his moral convictions.
Gather as many men loyal to me as you can.
I wanna have a strong hand in case our king suffers a temporary loss of judgment.
But first we deal with the Warrior Princess.
You!
Come here.
Have her brought to my room.
Gabriel!
He's going to give us away.
You have a knack for this kind of thing.
He likes you.
Really?
Yeah.
Have you ever thought about having a baby?
No.
I can't afford to dream about something that'll never be.
Now, I feel as if I know too much.
But I wouldn't trade it for anything.
You know I wouldn't.
Don't be afraid, my child.
My desire is pleasure, not pain.
My pleasure is yours, my lord.
I merely want to take your responsibilities from you.
At least for one evening.
I'm surprised you have time to take from your work or the king.
Is he working tonight?
He's in his chamber.
Oh, you smell so good!
You mean I'm actually near the royal chamber.
Just down the hallway.
But enough of him.
You spoke of pleasure.
And you spoke of pain.
My boy.
My only son.
What's become of your father, child?
The man your mother called husband...
I would have valued your life greater than my own.
And now another child's life is in my hands.
Why were you taken from me?
The box.
Guards!
That warrior woman is loose!
Search the room!
You two, come with me!
Break it down!
Xena, you can't escape.
Break it down!
Break it down!
Well, Xena...
You've made this far easier than I expected.
Hand me the box, and maybe I'll let you live.
You have no options, be certain of that.
There are many things I'm not certain of, Nemos..., ...but I'll bet my life this'll surprise you.
Sorry!
Come here.
We've got the baby, we've got the box...
Let's get out of here.
No, not yet.
There's still the prophecy.
What do you mean?
The prophecy's fulfilled if the baby lives.
-He'll grow up to take the kingdom.
-That's right.
That's why I have to give the baby to Gregor.
Don't be alarmed.
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.
What is it you want?
To fulfill the prophecy.
You wanna take my throne.
I have no interest in your throne.
I never have.
You're a good man, Gregor..., ...and a good ruler.
I know about your wife and child.
Think, Gregor.
This child will take your throne but as your heir, not as your conquero.
He's a child who needs a father to love him.
You're a father who needs a child to love.
That's the prophecy.
I was so blind.
I think it's time my people met their next king.
Have you lost your mind?
I've come to my senses.
You're being seduced.
It's a trick.
-Hand me that baby.
-I command you to return to your room.
What I do, I do for the betterment of this kingdom.
No, you don't!
Out of my way!
-It's her!
-She's got the baby!
-Here, Gabrielle!
-No, no, no!
Xena, catch!
Gabrielle, the baby!
Oh, no!
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
Any warrior would have done that.
What makes you think I'm not going to?
I feel a little nervous just letting it out of my sight.
Don't you worry.
As long as I or my son rule the box will be safe in my fortress.
The room is well protected.
Well, I'll still reset the lock every day.
But I won't have to wander anymore.
I think I finally have a home.
The child needs a mother.
Even as a king, I can't handle it alone.
You brought the prophecy true, Xena.
How can I ever repay you?
I didn't do it for payment.
Have a good life, all three of you.
Xena!
Isn't there anything you want?
Name him Gabriel.
You ready to go?
Sure.
I can't believe I touched the box.
Pandora's grandmother was cursed because of this.
And then Pandora is blessed because of it.
Does it all happen because of fate?
Or is it just chance?
I think it all happened 'cause you slept on a rock.
It did, didn't it?
All right, let's go.
There's nothing in it.
All these years...
she's been carrying around an empty box.
The box was empty, but Pandora was still carrying our hope.
What should we tell her?
We tell her the truth Hope has been and always will be safe.
It's inside every one of us.
Subtitles: @marlonrock1986 (^^V^^)
It's inevitable, the same dream.
I'm flying amongst the stars, directly toward the sun.
Alone.
Always alone.
I've become aware of a premonition that the sun is about to explode.
And what upsets me most is why.
Why did the sun have to die?
I fall through space, shocked to be alive... but presuming my life will soon be over.
I see the house where it happened... where the artificial intelligence rebels, the Silicates... took my parents' lives, and I wanna know why.
- The lights!
- I need to know why.
Shane, take care of them.
Remember how I told you?
They're here!
Hurry!
Cooper, turn it off!
What the hell is wrong with you, man?
Turn it off!
Coop, man, do you know what time it is?
Turn it off!
What the hell is your problem?
Listen up!
You're shipping' out.
Grab some chow, suit up and report to the ISSCV loading bay in 20 mikes.
Time to get up anyway.
- Atten-hut!
- As you were.
All right.
This one, you're goin' in on the ground.
You're to travel 215 M.S.K.'s beyond the seventh sector of the Kuiper Belt.
Destination:
The mining facility on Bunuel.
Ground assault?
Sentry duty.
Sir, the Chigs are kickin' our ass in a campaign outside Proxima.
Why are we being wasted on sentry duty?
The procurement and protection of raw material is vital to any war effort.
And the way this war is going, we can't afford any setbacks.
The facility on Bunuel mines natural helium 3... a vital component of military rocket fuel.
Without it, every ship and jet in this fleet is grounded, and we die.
The miners are preparing to transfer ice ore... to a heavily armed convoy which arrives in two days.
You are to guard against any enemy attempt to disrupt that transfer.
- All clear?
- Yes, sir.
I know you think this is routine, but look alive.
In this war, there is no such thing as a routine assignment.
Now, I've been called to the carrier Colin Powell to advise on A.C.M. strategies.
So, Vansen, you're honcho.
West is X.O.
Move out.
Sir!
Uh...
- Maybe West should be honcho.
- What's the problem?
It's not like you to turn down command.
You ever feel like there's something out there... waiting?
Feeling like maybe you're not coming back?
Everyone gets that.
How does everyone deal with it?
They go out and they come back, or they don't.
Thanks for keeping it simple.
Vansen.
There's no such thing as predetermination, and there's no such thing as luck.
You make things happen.
Keep your head together and don't make mistakes, and you'll come back.
It's that simple.
You're honcho.
Some buddies took me to Las Vegas right before the academy... and, uh, we saw this show at the Destiny Casino...
"Great Moments of Vegas."
Right.
They're all robomations, but there was this one.
I forget the guy's name.
A fat guy... huge collars, scarves and stuff... white suit, huge sideburns... swingin' around, doing karate moves, singin' this song.
He's going...
I was rollin'.
And the weird thing is... outrageous as this guy looked, afterwards...
I swear on my life, I saw him in the grocery store.
Right afterwards.
It was unbelievable.
- A huge guy.
- InVitros are bad gamblers.
There was only a 27 percent success rate of gestation in the Tanks.
We used up all our luck just being born.
Got a bogey tracking us.
D.M.E. says about 100 K.M.S.K.'s and closing in.
- Did you send out an I.F.F.?
- No response.
It's a single body.
Chig attack jets always fly in groups.
Could be a comet.
Flight Command, this is Vansen.
Alter line of travel 25 degrees for E.A.
Copy that.
Evasive Action in three, two, one.
It altered its course.
Stations!
Let's go!
Let's go!
- Cap Comm status.
- Bogey, 75 K.M.S.K.'s, closing.
All stations, 14 by 10 degrees off the port stern.
Shane, check Channel 4.
Silicates.
Negative.
A.I.'s have never been seen in this area.
- That's an artificial intelligence signal.
- Bogey, 3:00.
- West, I can't get to it.
- Got it.
- Got it!
- Nice shot, Cooper!
Direct kill.
Bogey has been terminated.
- Had to be a comet.
- Looked to me like an alien mother ship.
You're probably right.
The comet's refraction... might have made it look like it was altering course.
- Yeah, right.
- Still scanning.
Powering down over here.
- All right.
Let's close it.
- It's at 360.
Clear.
Approaching destination.
Icarus Mining Colony, this is the 58th Squadron.
Requesting permission to land.
Twelve down, 10 over.
Ten down, three over.
Five, four, three, two, contact.
Good luck, 58th.
Catch you later.
I've waited months for this... a surface gravity two-thirds less than Earth's.
Go long.
- Go real long.
- You'll never see it.
Wang, known for fourth-quarter heroics, steps to the center.
He takes the snap, he drops back, he sees Nathan wide open!
It's a Hail Mary!
He scores!
I can't wait till this planet gets an expansion team.
Five billion years in total darkness.
It's like the sun died or somethin'.
All right.
Quit clownin' around.
We're burnin' daylight.
- What daylight?
- This may be a B.S. detail... but until the convoy gets here, we are running it like we are out in the thick.
Sterling, Yeoman, you pull watch on the ISSCV.
Radio the miners, inform them that the password is "Bulldog", the response is "Chesty".
- Everyone clear?
Bulldog.
- Chesty.
The rest of us will man the perimeter.
Move out.
Woodiat and I'll cover the west side.
All right.
- Sentry Seven's all clear here.
- Sentry Six is clear.
Paths on all sides clear.
Team One reporting.
Processing tanks.
All clear.
- So, are we having fun yet?
- Mm-hmm.
It's so damn quiet.
It sort of freaks me out sometimes... when all you can hear is your own breathing.
Yeah.
Yeah, Pump House 9, secure.
Looks all clear from here.
- Bulldog!
- Terrier.
This is Hawkes.
Nelson's down!
I don't know what the hell's happening here!
We got incoming!
Pull back!
Pull back to the ISSCV!
Open it!
Nelson and Woodiat are dead!
Night-vision binocs.
They killed all the miners.
Didn't sound like alien fire.
- It wasn't aliens.
- If it wasn't the Chigs, then who attacked us?
- And why?
- They're not human.
And I don't know why.
We have to counterattack now before they have time to establish defenses.
- We need reinforcements.
We wait for the convoy.
- That's 12 hours.
We're all going to be nothing but little gold stars... on our mothers' windows if we just wait here.
We're outnumbered.
This will even things up.
We have no recon to plan our attack.
They've shut down Platform 1, but are maintaining mining operations below Platform 2.
They're hijacking the He3 ore.
They've shut off the oxygen and the W.F.R.S.
- The what?
- Waste Fluid Recycling System.
It converts all of the facilities' waste fluid... including sweat and urine, into drinking water.
Can you toss me a couple of those?
There's a subsurface tunnel connecting Platform One to Platform Two... and both structures to the outside where there's an air lock, a back door.
- Negative.
- Just hear me out.
Gordon and Wang create a diversion by hitting Platform One with the S.S.M.'s... while we enter from below through the tunnel.
There will be guards at both points.
- We take 'em out with the smart grenades.
- That is an unacceptable risk.
It's unacceptable if the Silicates pirate the helium 3 and sell it to the Chigs.
And probably a risk Nelson and Woodiat wished they'd had a chance to take.
Risk?
Chance?
You guys are beginning to sound like the damn Silicates.
What the hell's she talkin' about?
Silicates are creatures of chance.
Coop, you're an InVitro, man.
You were raised to fight the A.I.'s.
You know nothing about them?
The InVitro platoons were dissolved when I was born.
Why should I care?
A.I.'s were manufactured to be servants and soldiers... walking P.C.'s.
- Sounds familiar.
- InVitros are human.
A.I.'s are machines designed to be visually pleasing... while programmed to comprehend abstract concepts... philosophy, theology, ethics.
They could understand these ideas, but they were not allowed to originate new ideas.
Their superior intelligence was totally learned.
See, they could understand an idea like freedom... but they didn't have the ability to formulate how to obtain freedom.
Then how'd they do it?
Around 2047, there was a programmer who worked for Silicate-Tronics.
He was upgrading the essential A.I. processing unit...
- Dr. Ken Stranahan.
- Stranahan was a genius... but he was sick and tired of his boss taking all the credit, so he inserted a virus.
It just said, "Take a chance".
That started the A.I. wars.
See, the idea of risk is like a religion for the A.I.'s.
I mean, the only thing human-created, including themselves... that they respect is gambling.
Silicates learned how to win a rebellion against humans... fear, intimidation, mercilessness.
They don't feel these emotions, but they know how it affects us.
For 10 years, they were terrorists on Earth, until we finally got an upper hand.
Then again, they took a chance... commandeered some military launch vehicles and took off into space.
Why would "take a chance" cause a rebellion?
Isn't that what any really new idea is all about?
It's not like you to run from a fight.
What's goin' on?
The Silicates murdered my mother and father... and I'm...
Afraid?
They're destined to kill me.
It's so weird.
I've waited my whole life for this.
I never thought that I'd get a chance to confront them.
And now, I...
Look, you're honcho.
We all respect you.
It's your call.
Let's make it happen.
Do it!
Nuked.
Sterling's dead.
Vansen and I will try and reinitiate oxygen flow.
The rest rendezvous with Wang and Gordon.
Move!
What do you want, an invitation?
Come on.
Get in here.
They're in here.
You took all the hard-way bets and crapped out.
Now all bets are off.
There's no way to get it back on.
We got about an hour left of residual O2 before we have to use our rebreather packs.
I'm down to 20 percent.
West.
Thanks for covering my ass back there.
Damphousse, Vanessa, Lieutenant.
- Serial number 5351927...
- Damphousse, stop!
Tell 'em nothin'!
- No!
- Don't say...
Leave him alone!
Load all of the He3, but be ready for the hit-and-run.
Right now, we don't know the convoy's E.T.A., but we will.
Smart money coughs up the convoy's arrival time.
Brandon I.M. remains functional.
He's prisoner of two Carbonites.
- Position?
- Indeterminable due to malfunction.
Where are the other two?
Where are the other two?
If the I.M. unit cashes out, you cash out.
This unit's still functional.
That damn sound.
That's how they communicate.
They're networked through a wireless Modem.
It's probably trying to relay its position.
- Then they'll be coming.
- Not if we find their position first.
If I can call up its Random Access Memory... the other Silicates may have transmitted their position to this unit.
- Crack the casing on your X.T. unit.
- Okay.
Hurry!
It's shutting down.
Put the prongs behind the right temporal.
They're attacking the Carbonite colony at Vesta.
That's read-only memory.
Try again.
Quarter inch higher.
Take a chance.
Take a chance.
Kill 'em all.
- Rid the Earth of humans.
- That's the start of the rebellion.
Again!
Again!
It's shutting down!
It's dying!
Silicates have a 5M terabyte collective memory.
Any unit can recall events that happened to any A.I. that was ever built.
Transmission received, 013023.
Feliciti O.H. 519.
Position is currently Platform A, air lock.
- This unit is still functional.
- We got what we need.
If any A.I. is capable of recalling any A.I. event... then this one can tell me why they killed my family.
You've got another family to keep alive.
What the hell?
He's a Tank.
What are you doing with them?
They farmed you to kill us, 'cause they didn't want to die.
You're a sucker.
You don't owe them anything.
Give up the other two.
What's the E.T.A. on the convoy?
And you can walk.
Come on, Tank.
- Don't like me playing with your nipple?
- It's a navel.
Well, now it's a target.
Take a chance.
That's what you believe, isn't it?
I want to take a chance.
You got the cards.
Let them fall where they may.
You win, we'll tell you what you want.
I win, you let us go.
I thought you said your luck ran out.
- Do you know what you're doin', Cooper?
- Ain't nothin' to it.
Your bet, my game.
Blackjack, single deck.
I stick on 17.
- Hole card is down.
- What did she say?
- Look, it's whoever gets closest to 21 without going over.
- Got it.
The stakes have just been raised.
The I.M. unit has terminated function.
Now you're not playing for your freedom.
You're playing for your lives.
You got 17 showing.
- Give me one.
- No!
Fifteen.
Twenty.
Fate's a bitch.
- Cut us down!
- Get the gun!
Get the gun!
Move up!
We'll get 'em in a cross fire!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Fall back!
Fall back!
Fall back!
Get down!
- I'm out.
- I've got 12 rounds.
Where's Vansen?
I hope in a better place than we are.
Shane, take care of them.
Remember how I told you?
- They're here!
Hurry!
- Mother.
The He3 is loaded.
We're ready to go.
The rest of us will join you after we kill the Carbonites.
Down to my last clip.
They're advancing, and I'm out.
I can spare half a clip.
The mine's running out of residual air.
If they don't kill us, CO2 poisoning will.
Why am I getting the feeling I'm not going to catch the next Packers-Bears game?
Can we hold out till the convoy arrives?
It's hours away.
I want to know why.
Replay why the Silicates killed my family.
Do it, and I'll let you go.
The odds are low against trusting a human.
Take a chance.
This is all naval housing.
Slaughter the pigs in the pen.
Which one first?
Stop the car.
Heads, this house.
Tails, that house.
Tails.
Oh, yeah, this is it.
I can see pictures of kids, little girls.
It'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow... when they find the whole family's blood on the walls.
The Vansen family.
They've seen us.
Better luck next time.
Shane, they're here!
Maybe we just ought to make an all-out break for it.
- Every man for himself.
- That's not the way to do it.
It's damn quiet.
It's worse than the gunfire.
They're gettin' ready for the last push.
Wang, what are you doin'?
Writing them a scorching critical essay?
If any friendlies find my body, I want the ashes spread over Wrigley Field.
We're a long way from Wrigley.
Okay, they're coming.
Don't fire till they come over the wall!
- No!
- They're trying to sucker us to look out.
Bulldog!
Chesty!
They're loading the helium 3.
Let's do it.
The facility's out of air.
We're almost out of ammunition.
Take their weapons.
If we get to the ISSCV, we can radio the convoy.
They're in position to intercept the A.I. transport.
They'll retrieve the ore...
- That's not guaranteed!
- They're pirates!
We gotta save it for the real enemy.
They killed my family... because a coin came up tails.
They don't leave this rock.
Shane.
You've got your answer, okay?
Now you know why, and look where you are.
Revenge ain't gonna end it.
There's a thousand of them out there in space.
You can't kill them all.
Just drive on, or your fear will come true... and they'll kill you without even lifting a weapon.
Throw it to me!
Throw it to me!
Here!
Throw it to me, Shane.
Throw it to me!
Throw it to me!
Give me it!
I didn't have a turn!
Why is it always landing on the ground?
Wait.
Give it to us.
Bring it over here.
It's all right.
Come on.
Give it to him.
Watch your hands.
Watch your hands.
- We're cutting it pretty close.
- Man, I don't wanna miss my ride.
- The Mac Arthur will wait for us.
- They gotta wait.
I've been T.D.Y. On Groombridge 34 since April.
- You goin' Earthside?
- Haven't seen my wife since before the war.
She's probably forgotten what I look like.
I know.
I know.
In my case, maybe that's a good thing.
Still, it'll be nice to have dinner at home.
Man, would I love a meal that wasn't freeze-dried.
- Just havin' a break's gonna be good.
- [Laser Fire]
Take cover!
Take cover.!
Chig snipers in the tower.!
Chig snipers in the tower!
Cooper, Monk, cover the right flank.
Vansen, West, take the left.
Monk, keep down!
Medic!
No.
Come on.
- Hold on!
- I'm not gonna die.
Not yet.
Please, not yet.
[Clamoring]
- Medic!
- Cooper, don't leave me.
Don't let me die alone.
Two migs morphine.
Lasix, 80 mills, I.V. Push.
- Vitals?
- His name's Solomon Monk.
He doesn't need a doctor, Lieutenant.
He needs a rabbi.
- L-Look, maybe there's a chance-
- These men have a chance.
Tell my wife I don't mind goin' except for her.
Sh-She was my- my wife.
Cooper.!
We're takin'off in five.
We're hitching'a ride on a cargo ship.
He's dead.
His family will want these.
Come on.
Let's go.
[Man Over Radio] 58th, you're clear for docking.
Captain Lewelyn, I'm Colonel McQueen... 58th Air Commando Group en route from Fire Base Langston to the carrier Saratoga.
I waited for you, Colonel.
I didn't want you to miss your ride.
- How bad is it down below?
- Langston's still hot.
I lost a good man to a sniper tonight.
We have new orders.
Our course will take us through Blood Alley.
It's dangerous, but it's the only way out.
[Lewelyn] I don't suppose there's a chance of a fighter escort?
- Not in this lifetime.
- Careful of that!
Sixteen pounds prime rib.
- Black market.
- What'd that cost you?
I traded my only 1986 Dan Fouts card.
Better be pretty good prime rib.
InVitros.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Man] You've come to the right place.
Every man down here's a Tank.
- J.J. Keats.
- Hawkes.
Cooper Hawkes.
Ashby!
The engine room foreman.
- Howdy.
- Sorrell, Chief Engineer.
- Everyone on the crew a Tank?
- Six of us.
Seven humans including the captain.
Computers do the rest of the work.
Ever notice how Tanks always get the dirty jobs?
Isn't that why we were made?
You got that right.
You did good for yourself.
There's no trick becoming chief petty officer on a tramp steamer.
Do the dirty jobs, keep your mouth shut, go along.
Captain Lewelyn- better than most.
I got a standing invitation to take meals in the captain's mess.
Most of the cargo is humans suspended in cryogenic sleep.
They put you under, five years later, you wake up.
It's the next day of your life.
We're carrying six containers of unborn InVitros.
They're being shipped to a plutonium mining facility... in the Corvus star system.
They don't stand a chance.
What're a few Tanks, more or less?
- Do you know who they are?
- Right now they're just numbers on a cargo manifest.
Can't believe InVitros are still being shipped like that.
Set course for the Canis Majoris star system.
Plotting course for Canis Majoris star system.
- Bring us to 260 A.U.'s.
- Aye, aye, sir. 260 A.U.'s.
Plot course heading 2-1 -fiver.
That's Blood Alley.
The nav-channel's 200 klicks wide.
Things change, Potter.
There's a war on.
Captain, that course takes us between Adhara and Aludra.
The hydrogen gasses play havoc with the radio communication.
The solar flares screw up the onboard computers.
It's the fastest way from Groombridge 34...
- to the battleship Saratoga.
- I don't recall hiring on for a suicide mission.
When I give an order, Mr. Potter, be so good as to follow it.
Plot a course heading 2-1 -fiver, Mr. Harkin.
All ahead full, Mr. Mercer.
All ahead full.
[McQueen] Quite a cargo you've got here.
First five years out of the tank...
I worked the uranium mines at Omicron Draconis.
Thirty four of us were shipped out.
Six came back.
I don't know if there's a hell, but if there is, I've already been there.
That was before the World Federation banned indentured servitude, Colonel.
The InVitros I'm hauling signed on for the job.
You have a cargo of unborn, Captain.
What did they sign on for?
[Man's Voice] Janice loved your present.
I took her to Detroit Disneyland for her birthday.
She loved Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
I miss you.
You're still my favorite wild ride.
- My boyfriend's little girl.
- She's cute.
Yeah.
She still misses her mother though, big time.
She'll learn to love you.
Love isn't learned, Nathan.
It just is.
[Shane] How can you fall in love with someone you've never met?
Martie and I talk every day.
You met her through a personals ad in SpaceNet, Wang.
[Chuckles] You don't even know what she looks like.
I love the way she thinks.
She's got a great sense of humor.
Okay, let's say that you guys get along great at seven light-years.
What happens when you have to sit across a table eye to eye?
How will you know how to act with each other?
Is that a question or a confession?
You writing' Monk's wife?
How do you know what to put?
I tell his wife he was a good man and will be missed.
Is that what it says in the regs?
No.
That's what it says here.
How do you know what humans are feeling?
I see the laughter and tears, and I know.
I don't feel that stuff.
They take us out of the tank at 18, Hawkes.
You can't get 18 years back in a day.
Do you ever wonder what it would be like... to have a mother or a father?
I don't think about what never was.
But... it don't bother you that when you die... there's gonna be no blood relation there to say words over you?
The Corps is my family, Hawkes.
The men and women I served with will know what to say.
Yeah, you got that right.
It's great to have real food, Captain.
[Cooper] Captain... the invitro manifest-
- Cooper, not now.
- I'd like to see it.
You know what he's tryin' to do, Captain.
The same thing they all do- look for family.
No offense, but, uh... how can something grown in a tank consider itself related to anything else?
Except maybe algae.
Stuff a sock in it, Potter.
- [Rumbling] - [Clamoring]
What the hell-
Take a damage control team aft.
Secure the cargo hold.
- [Beeping]
- Coolant temp's spiked to 700!
- Step the rods down.
- Got it.
- Take it off-line.
- Going off-line.
[Alarm Blaring]
[Man Over P.A.] Generator Room, go to secondary power.
All right, come on, Clyde.
Don't fail me now.
Backup generators have kicked in.
Engine Room, Bridge.
Reactor's scrammed.
We're off line.
Core's unstable.
- What hit us?
- Solar flare.
What else can one expect when flying between two unstable suns?
- I want you midship with Keats.
- Yes, sir.
- What's your weapons package?
- Two laser pulse cannons, unmanned.
Vansen!
Wang!
With your permission, Captain.
Just in case that wasn't a solar flare.
Under the circumstances, I think there's room for two on the bridge.
- Damphousse.
- I know, Colonel.
Engine room.
Hawkes, I want you to go work with Keats.
I want one of us on damage control.
- Keats is one of us.
- He's a civilian.
We're marines.
And Hawkes, forget the invitro manifest.
The 58th is your family.
Looking for a past you never lived can only get you hurt.
Feeling pain's part of being human.
Who said you're human?
[Alarm Blaring]
Hey, where're you goin'?
What about Section 46?
We don't inspect it?
People are the priority here.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Tanks aren't people.
Look, you just stay away, pal.
You got no business over there.
What the hell is going on here?
Navigator was right.
White light solar flare.
I know what the machine says.
What do you say?
- There's no way to tell.
- Trust your instincts, West.
That's how you stay alive.
There's something out there.
I can feel it.
- [McQueen] Engine Room, Bridge.
- Core temperature's stabilized.
Estimate to get the reactor on line?
Maybe today.
Maybe Malaba Day.
- Stored energy?
- [Sorrel] 4.5 kilotons in the containment vessel.
- Keep the engine on line.
- Yes, sir!
Clad temp- 600.
Let's go back online.
Don't know what caused the coolant temp to spike.
It could happen again.
Worst thing that can happen is we could blow up, Mr. Ashby.
Then I don't see the problem.
The coolant density's at 800 kilograms over M3.
I think we're in the clear.
Let's do it.
Raise Rod 1.
Rod 1 raised.
Raise Rod 2.
[Ashby] Rod 2 raised.
You know your stuff.
Bridge, this is Fire Control.
Request permission for a weapons check.
[McQueen] Fire Control, Bridge.
Permission granted.
Fire light status- green.
- Fire light status- green.
- [McQueen] Commence firing.
Bucks like a mule.
West, anything?
I'd have better luck reading tea leaves, sir.
At least tea leaves would tell us something.
Let me see that.
She the girl you went AWOL for?
Yes, sir.
This is behind you.
The only thing on your mind is that radar screen.
- [Keats] I figured you'd show up.
- [Exhales]
The Tank cargo manifest.
The number on the left's the date of conception.
The middle number's the gene pool.
This is the batch number on the right.
Place of conception is indicated in the margin.
I've been lookin' 10 years, Cooper, so I know what you're feelin'.
You're wondering what it would be like to have family.
Only all the time.
What are you?
March 6, 2040.
Gene pool 16A.
Batch Alpha-3439.
The Philadelphia facility.
Brooklyn facility.
Not that it really matters.
All I know is that somewhere there's someone who's D.N.A. Reads...
A-T, C-G, T-A, G-C, C-G, A-T- that's black hair and hazel green eyes.
See, I know what my family would be like, but I can't find them.
Enjoy the read.
Hand me a reverse torque wrench.
Here's what I think.
Human beings are nothing more than highly evolved animals.
- Tell that to Einstein.
- We're attracted to a person because the way that they look.
The way that they smell.
The way that they feel to the touch.
Okay, so what's your point?
How can you fall in love with a woman that you met on SpaceNet?
You don't believe in the soul?
In spiritual connection?
I believe in what you can reach out and touch.
Then reach out and touch that morph head.
- [Nathan] I'm getting something.
- [McQueen] Range and bearing?
Looks like an energy pulse, Colonel.
I can't get an exact reading.
- It's gone.
- Just tell me what you saw.
I don't know!
Solar spike.
I need to know what's out there, West.
Figure it out.
Ceramic fuel temp- 1200 and holding.
Bridge, Engine Room.
Reactor's on line.
[McQueen] Well done, Damphousse.
I'll need full power.
- Full power.
- So, how come you got detailed down here?
Four years at Caltech.
Two summers I interned at San Onofre.
What kind of lunatic interns at a nuclear power plant?
My father was chief engineer.
Lot of people won't work with nipple-necks.
Let me tell you something, Mr. Ashby.
I'll work with anyone who wants to work.
Not a lot of people feel that way.
I'm not a lot of people.
What is it with you people?
How can you expect to be a marine?
You can't follow a simple order?
Huh?
Don't ever touch me again.
Oh, and what's so special about you?
I got a petri dish.
I can always make another Tank.
Scram it!
[Vanessa] Bridge, Engine Room.
Scrammed.
- Taking all systems off-line.
- Generator Room, Bridge.
- Go to secondary power supply.!
- Doing it now.
Captain, fire in the generator room.!
Potter, this is the captain.
Get a fire team to Station 4.
Help!
Aaah!
- [Potter] How bad is it?
- [Keats] Bad!
- We gotta get to the emergency shutoff valve.
- [Potter] Bruckheimer.
- Can you get to it?
- Do somethin' or we're gonna lose the generator.
There's protective gear in the cargo hold.
We don't have the time.
There's no other way.
[Keats] Cooper, what're you doing?
You don't owe them this, Cooper.
[Man] Cooper, don't do it.!
[Keats] Protect yourself down there, Coop.
Protect yourself.
[Man] It's crayy, Cooper.
Come on back.
Bruckheimer.
Cargo hold.
- I'm getting something.
- [McQueen] What's its signature?
- There is no signature.
- What does your gut tell you, West?
- What's the level of threat?
- I can't tell, Colonel, without more information.
All I'm getting are microwave emissions.
Enlarge it, West.
You happen to remember the U3-78 specs?
What we have here is an unidentified blob.
Give me the U3-78 specs!
The U3-78s- uh, alien class "D" destroyer, a hunter-killer.
- Weapons package?
- Rockets, mines, guided weapons.
- What else?
- Special ops thinks she has... advanced microwave technology that screw up... communications.
Causes reactor temperatures to spike.
- Goes for the soft kill.
- My gut tells me... that your unidentified blob is a U3-78... and he's comin' in for the hard kill.
Sir, I have radar contact.
Bearing 276.
Range- two parsecs.
Azimuth 4-niner.
There's not enough power to get us out of harm's way.
There's only one way to take the load off the second generator- cut power to one section of the cargo hold.
- You mean kill people.
- It's math, Colonel.
One section dies or we all die.
Is there really a choice?
Section 46 gives us the most power for the fewest lives.
Generator Room, this is Captain Lewelyn.
Stand by to cut power to Section 46.
Repeat.
Stand by to cut power to Section 46.
Section 46 houses 12 containers of InVitros, Captain.
That's 168 lives.
It's the only way to get the reactor back online.
There has to be another way, Captain.
That's an order, Keats.
Section 46.
Stand by.
McQueen won't let this happen.
He's one of us.
You hear his voice raised in protest just now?
What did you find?
I got a sister in Section 46.
[Whirring, Grinding]
Engine Room, Bridge.
Can you go on line?
- Negative.
I can't give you power.
- It's time to pull the plug.
Keats.
This is the captain.
Cut power to Section 46.
- Negative, Captain.
- Just what the hell is the problem?
- I'm the problem, Captain.
- There's not a lot of room for interpretation in your orders.
I won't do it, Captain.
Too many of us have died fighting your wars.
You're putting every life on this ship at risk.
Then we die equal.
[Potter] Keats.!
Some are more equal than others.
[Potter Straining]
Stay right there.
Right there.
Lift him up.
Are you gonna help me save those Tanks?
Because I know one thing- you're not going to kill your own people.
Keats, confirm you're cutting power to Section 46.
Keats, answer me.
Keats, what's going on?
Cut power, or we're gonna lose the ship.
Keats.!
Keats.!
Do it, man.!
Keats.!
Keats.!
Ceramic fuel temp- 1600.
- Ashby, Sorrell, come here.
- Yes, sir.
- What's the problem?
- Sir.
Captain's giving orders to kill the InVitros in Section 46.
- You can't let him do that.
- I can't stop him!
Not alone.
[Chattering]
[Beeps, Squawks]
- Missile's launched!
- Confirm that.
They're off the rails!
Engine Room, Bridge.
Give me everything you've got.
[Vanessa] 3.6 kilotons thrust.
Maximum power.
Vansen, Wang!
Missile incoming!
Lock on!
- Bingo!
- We're locked on.
Let's rock and roll.
2100 klicks.
1800 klicks.
Colonel, launch the cargo haulers.
The missiles will go for them, not us.
Launch starboard cargo haulers.
Prepare ship for impact!
Eight, seven, six-
Fire!
Come to Mama.
- Hard left rudder.
- Hard left rudder.
[Lasers Firing]
West, radar contact?
Negative.
But the U3-78's gonna come looking for confirmation of the kill.
Good call.
I'm going aft.
- Come on.
Come on!
- You're a dead man, Keats.
A dead man.
I don't want to kill you.
I will if I have to.
- What the hell's going on?
- A change in command.
You two stand down.
I'm not taking orders from you.
You are now.
Stand down.
How can you let him kill InVitros?
Our operating systems are down, Hawkes.
The captain has no choice.
- You can stop him.
- The captain's word is law.
When someone decides to kill an InVitro... it's not my law, and it shouldn't be yours.
Keats gave you the manifest.
- Who'd you find?
- A sister.
How could you kill your own people?
How can you?
Answer me!
- [Keats] Captain.!
- [Cocks Gun]
- I'm taking the helm.
- Are you adding mutiny to your résumé, Mr. Keats?
Mutiny, Captain?
He's adding murder.
- He'll kill us all.
- Whatever it takes.
As long as InVitros don't die.
Sit him down.
Stay at your post, son.
I need you alive.
Tell McQueen you need him on the bridge.
Tell him!
[McQueen] I'll buy us a little more time.
I'll give Damphousse five minutes... to get the reactor back on line.
If she can't, I have to pull the plug.
[Lewelyn Over Radio] Colonel McQueen, report to the bridge.
- [Lewelyn] You're makin' a mistake, Keats.
- It won't be the first, sir.
[Yells]
Don't even think about it.
This isn't what I wanted.
That's not good enough.
Get your men back to their stations.
I'm taking the bridge.
- [Gun Cocks]
- I can't allow that.
[Cooper] You are not going to kill him.
And you are not going to kill the Tanks.
You can't have it both ways.
[Nathan] I'm picking up an active gamma pulse.
He's doing a Yankee search.
Yankee search is an old navy term.
The bastard who's hunting us figures we're a pile of space garbage.
He's coming in to confirm the kill.
And right now there's not a damn thing we can do.
Bridge, Fire Control.
Fire light status-red.!
Repeat.
Fire light red.
Get us power.
What does the colonel want us to do now?
Throw rocks?
Pretty soon you're going to have to decide if you're gonna kill us.
- Pulse intervals decreasing.
- Clock's running out, Hawkes.
Time to decide.
Whose side are you on?
There are no sides, Colonel.
Just right and wrong.
Give me the gun.
The colonel will do the right thing.
You have to trust that.
Do you, Cooper?
Do you trust him?
Yes.
Don't make it worse.
Sir, the bridge is yours.
Thank you, Mr. Hawkes.
Engine Room, Bridge.
We have incoming.
Get me back online.
No can do.!
Pressure shocks hit the primary system hard.
This whole damn thing's gonna melt down if I don't get some help here.
We work together... or we die.
It's that simple.
I need your help, Mr. Keats.
Be good enough to get your men back to the engine room.
Fire Control, Bridge.
The captain's dead.
We have a class nine emergency.
Report to the engine room or the nuclear reactor's gonna melt down.
Maybe later you'll tell us what the hell is going on.
You ever try to do the right thing, only it turns out wrong?
Kick in the emergency core coolant system in... five, four, three... two, one-
Now!
Reload initiated.
[Exhales]
Glad to have you back.
Bridge, Engine Room. 90 minutes to get your reactor back on line.
- [Nathan] He's coming right at us.!
- Can't fight.
We can't run.
And your five minutes are up.
Now what the hell do you expect me to do?
Cut power to another section.
Pop quiz, Hawkes.
You cut power to Section 46, 168 Tanks die.
You cut the power to any other section, 400 humans die.
Now, how does the math work out?
What do you do?
We're dead center in the gamma pulse.
We have one advantage, Hawkes.
The U3-78 doesn't know we're ready to fight.
Are we?
Are we ready to fight?
[Machines Whirring]
[Hawkes Over P.A.] Power's cut to Section 46.
We have generator power, sir.
Bridge, Fire Control.
Fire light green.
[McQueen Over Radio] Hold your fire until the U3-78 closes.
At two klicks, he can't fire his missiles.
Solar flare.
I got no screen.
We lost the targeting system.
The solar flare scrambled the screen.
The only way the U3-78 can make contact is visual.
Right now, we are not on his radar screen.
Estimated time for his radar retrieval- three minutes.
We're blind and he's blind.
Let's play a little hide-and-seek.
Hard left rudder.
- Hard left rudder, sir.
- Fire Control, Bridge.
We don't know where she is, but she's out there.
Lower the blast shield!
[Mercer] Lowering the blast shield, sir.
He's coming right at us.
Wang!
Vansen!
Bogey bears 3-3-niner.
1.5 klicks, ayimuth 90 degrees.
Weapons hold.
Fire perigee kick motor, Mr. Mercer.
- Sir, we'll break up.
- Fire perigee kick motor!
- Come on.
Give the order.
- What's he waiting for?
Weapons hold.
Weapons hold.
Now!
Fire!
Fire!
All screens are clear.
[Damphousse] Pressure's at 18.5.
Climbing.
The core temp's cooling.
Bridge, Engine Room.
The reactor's stabilized.
We have 90 mikes until we're on line.
[McQueen] Good work, Damphousse.
I had a little help from my friends, sir.
There's gonna be hell to pay.
It was my call, Sorrell.
I'll take the responsibility.
We stand together.
- Plot a new course, Mr. Harkin.
- Yes, sir.
West.
Launching the cargo haulers was a great countermeasure.
I thought I had to make a point.
No.
You were right.
What I did- going after her- was selfish.
It won't happen again.
I know that, West.
Thanks.
My pleasure.

No, the way I see it... you'll only end up with a broken heart, and I don't have the time.
You did the right thing.
We're marines, Cooper.
Not Tanks.
What's gonna happen to Keats?
Keats and Ashby will stand trial for mutiny.
Sorrell, for murder.
Sorry f-
I'm sorry.
What would you know about sorrow?
I know this much.
I never had the... courage to look for my family.
Not because I was afraid of what I might find... but because I was afraid of what I might feel.
Kate.
Kate.
I'm sorry.
[Man] Watch your hands.
Watch your hands.
- We're cutting it pretty close.
- Man, I don't wanna miss my ride.
- The Mac Arthur will wait for us.
- They gotta wait.
I've been T.D.Y. On Groombridge 34 since April.
- You goin' Earthside?
- Haven't seen my wife since before the war.
She's probably forgotten what I look like.
I know.
I know.
In my case, maybe that's a good thing.
Still, it'll be nice to have dinner at home.
Man, would I love a meal that wasn't freeze-dried.
- Just havin' a break's gonna be good.
- [Laser Fire]
Take cover!
Take cover.!
Chig snipers in the tower.!
Chig snipers in the tower!
Cooper, Monk, cover the right flank.
Vansen, West, take the left.
Monk, keep down!
Medic!
No.
Come on.
- Hold on!
- I'm not gonna die.
Not yet.
Please, not yet.
[Clamoring]
- Medic!
- Cooper, don't leave me.
Don't let me die alone.
Two migs morphine.
Lasix, 80 mills, I.V. Push.
- Vitals?
- His name's Solomon Monk.
He doesn't need a doctor, Lieutenant.
He needs a rabbi.
- L-Look, maybe there's a chance-
- These men have a chance.
Tell my wife I don't mind goin' except for her.
Sh-She was my- my wife.
Cooper.!
We're takin'off in five.
We're hitching'a ride on a cargo ship.
He's dead.
His family will want these.
Come on.
Let's go.
[Man Over Radio] 58th, you're clear for docking.
Captain Lewelyn, I'm Colonel McQueen... 58th Air Commando Group en route from Fire Base Langston to the carrier Saratoga.
I waited for you, Colonel.
I didn't want you to miss your ride.
- How bad is it down below?
- Langston's still hot.
I lost a good man to a sniper tonight.
We have new orders.
Our course will take us through Blood Alley.
It's dangerous, but it's the only way out.
[Lewelyn] I don't suppose there's a chance of a fighter escort?
- Not in this lifetime.
- Careful of that!
Sixteen pounds prime rib.
- Black market.
- What'd that cost you?
I traded my only 1986 Dan Fouts card.
Better be pretty good prime rib.
InVitros.
[Breathing Heavily]
[Man] You've come to the right place.
Every man down here's a Tank.
- J.J. Keats.
- Hawkes.
Cooper Hawkes.
Ashby!
The engine room foreman.
- Howdy.
- Sorrell, Chief Engineer.
- Everyone on the crew a Tank?
- Six of us.
Seven humans including the captain.
Computers do the rest of the work.
Ever notice how Tanks always get the dirty jobs?
Isn't that why we were made?
You got that right.
You did good for yourself.
There's no trick becoming chief petty officer on a tramp steamer.
Do the dirty jobs, keep your mouth shut, go along.
Captain Lewelyn- better than most.
I got a standing invitation to take meals in the captain's mess.
Most of the cargo is humans suspended in cryogenic sleep.
They put you under, five years later, you wake up.
It's the next day of your life.
We're carrying six containers of unborn InVitros.
They're being shipped to a plutonium mining facility... in the Corvus star system.
They don't stand a chance.
What're a few Tanks, more or less?
- Do you know who they are?
- Right now they're just numbers on a cargo manifest.
Can't believe InVitros are still being shipped like that.
Set course for the Canis Majoris star system.
Plotting course for Canis Majoris star system.
- Bring us to 260 A.U.'s.
- Aye, aye, sir. 260 A.U.'s.
Plot course heading 2-1-fiver.
That's Blood Alley.
The nav-channel's 200 klicks wide.
Things change, Potter.
There's a war on.
Captain, that course takes us between Adhara and Aludra.
The hydrogen gasses play havoc with the radio communication.
The solar flares screw up the onboard computers.
It's the fastest way from Groombridge 34...
- to the battleship Saratoga.
- I don't recall hiring on for a suicide mission.
When I give an order, Mr. Potter, be so good as to follow it.
Plot a course heading 2-1-fiver, Mr. Harkin.
All ahead full, Mr. Mercer.
All ahead full.
[McQueen] Quite a cargo you've got here.
First five years out of the tank...
I worked the uranium mines at Omicron Draconis.
Thirty four of us were shipped out.
Six came back.
I don't know if there's a hell, but if there is, I've already been there.
That was before the World Federation banned indentured servitude, Colonel.
The InVitros I'm hauling signed on for the job.
You have a cargo of unborn, Captain.
What did they sign on for?
[Man's Voice] Janice loved your present.
I took her to Detroit Disneyland for her birthday.
She loved Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
I miss you.
You're still my favorite wild ride.
- My boyfriend's little girl.
- She's cute.
Yeah.
She still misses her mother though, big time.
She'll learn to love you.
Love isn't learned, Nathan.
It just is.
[Shane] How can you fall in love with someone you've never met?
Martie and I talk every day.
You met her through a personals ad in SpaceNet, Wang.
[Chuckles] You don't even know what she looks like.
I love the way she thinks.
She's got a great sense of humor.
Okay, let's say that you guys get along great at seven light-years.
What happens when you have to sit across a table eye to eye?
How will you know how to act with each other?
Is that a question or a confession?
You writing' Monk's wife?
How do you know what to put?
I tell his wife he was a good man and will be missed.
Is that what it says in the regs?
No.
That's what it says here.
How do you know what humans are feeling?
I see the laughter and tears, and I know.
I don't feel that stuff.
They take us out of the tank at 18, Hawkes.
You can't get 18 years back in a day.
Do you ever wonder what it would be like... to have a mother or a father?
I don't think about what never was.
But... it don't bother you that when you die... there's gonna be no blood relation there to say words over you?
The Corps is my family, Hawkes.
The men and women I served with will know what to say.
Yeah, you got that right.
It's great to have real food, Captain.
[Cooper] Captain... the invitro manifest-
- Cooper, not now.
- I'd like to see it.
You know what he's tryin' to do, Captain.
The same thing they all do- look for family.
No offense, but, uh... how can something grown in a tank consider itself related to anything else?
Except maybe algae.
Stuff a sock in it, Potter.
- [Rumbling] - [Clamoring]
What the hell-
Take a damage control team aft.
Secure the cargo hold.
- [Beeping]
- Coolant temp's spiked to 700!
- Step the rods down.
- Got it.
- Take it off-line.
- Going off-line.
[Alarm Blaring]
[Man Over P.A.] Generator Room, go to secondary power.
All right, come on, Clyde.
Don't fail me now.
Backup generators have kicked in.
Engine Room, Bridge.
Reactor's scrammed.
We're off line.
Core's unstable.
- What hit us?
- Solar flare.
What else can one expect when flying between two unstable suns?
- I want you midship with Keats.
- Yes, sir.
- What's your weapons package?
- Two laser pulse cannons, unmanned.
Vansen!
Wang!
With your permission, Captain.
Just in case that wasn't a solar flare.
Under the circumstances, I think there's room for two on the bridge.
- Damphousse.
- I know, Colonel.
Engine room.
Hawkes, I want you to go work with Keats.
I want one of us on damage control.
- Keats is one of us.
- He's a civilian.
We're marines.
And Hawkes, forget the invitro manifest.
The 58th is your family.
Looking for a past you never lived can only get you hurt.
Feeling pain's part of being human.
Who said you're human?
[Alarm Blaring]
Hey, where're you goin'?
What about Section 46?
We don't inspect it?
People are the priority here.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Tanks aren't people.
Look, you just stay away, pal.
You got no business over there.
What the hell is going on here?
Navigator was right.
White light solar flare.
I know what the machine says.
What do you say?
- There's no way to tell.
- Trust your instincts, West.
That's how you stay alive.
There's something out there.
I can feel it.
- [McQueen] Engine Room, Bridge.
- Core temperature's stabilized.
Estimate to get the reactor on line?
Maybe today.
Maybe Malaba Day.
- Stored energy?
- [Sorrel] 4.5 kilotons in the containment vessel.
- Keep the engine on line.
- Yes, sir!
Clad temp- 600.
Let's go back online.
Don't know what caused the coolant temp to spike.
It could happen again.
Worst thing that can happen is we could blow up, Mr. Ashby.
Then I don't see the problem.
The coolant density's at 800 kilograms over M3.
I think we're in the clear.
Let's do it.
Raise Rod 1.
Rod 1 raised.
Raise Rod 2.
[Ashby] Rod 2 raised.
You know your stuff.
Bridge, this is Fire Control.
Request permission for a weapons check.
[McQueen] Fire Control, Bridge.
Permission granted.
Fire light status- green.
- Fire light status- green.
- [McQueen] Commence firing.
Bucks like a mule.
West, anything?
I'd have better luck reading tea leaves, sir.
At least tea leaves would tell us something.
Let me see that.
She the girl you went AWOL for?
Yes, sir.
This is behind you.
The only thing on your mind is that radar screen.
- [Keats] I figured you'd show up.
- [Exhales]
The Tank cargo manifest.
The number on the left's the date of conception.
The middle number's the gene pool.
This is the batch number on the right.
Place of conception is indicated in the margin.
I've been lookin' 10 years, Cooper, so I know what you're feelin'.
You're wondering what it would be like to have family.
Only all the time.
What are you?
March 6, 2040.
Gene pool 16A.
Batch Alpha-3439.
The Philadelphia facility.
Brooklyn facility.
Not that it really matters.
All I know is that somewhere there's someone who's D.N.A. Reads...
A
- T, C-G, T-A, G
- C, C-G, A-T- that's black hair and hazel green eyes.
See, I know what my family would be like, but I can't find them.
Enjoy the read.
Hand me a reverse torque wrench.
Here's what I think.
Human beings are nothing more than highly evolved animals.
- Tell that to Einstein.
- We're attracted to a person because the way that they look.
The way that they smell.
The way that they feel to the touch.
Okay, so what's your point?
How can you fall in love with a woman that you met on SpaceNet?
You don't believe in the soul?
In spiritual connection?
I believe in what you can reach out and touch.
Then reach out and touch that morph head.
- [Nathan] I'm getting something.
- [McQueen] Range and bearing?
Looks like an energy pulse, Colonel.
I can't get an exact reading.
- It's gone.
- Just tell me what you saw.
I don't know!
Solar spike.
I need to know what's out there, West.
Figure it out.
Ceramic fuel temp- 1200 and holding.
Bridge, Engine Room.
Reactor's on line.
[McQueen] Well done, Damphousse.
I'll need full power.
- Full power.
- So, how come you got detailed down here?
Four years at Caltech.
Two summers I interned at San Onofre.
What kind of lunatic interns at a nuclear power plant?
My father was chief engineer.
Lot of people won't work with nipple-necks.
Let me tell you something, Mr. Ashby.
I'll work with anyone who wants to work.
Not a lot of people feel that way.
I'm not a lot of people.
What is it with you people?
How can you expect to be a marine?
You can't follow a simple order?
Huh?
Don't ever touch me again.
Oh, and what's so special about you?
I got a petri dish.
I can always make another Tank.
Scram it!
[Vanessa] Bridge, Engine Room.
Scrammed.
- Taking all systems off-line.
- Generator Room, Bridge.
- Go to secondary power supply.!
- Doing it now.
Captain, fire in the generator room.!
Potter, this is the captain.
Get a fire team to Station 4.
Help!
Aaah!
- [Potter] How bad is it?
- [Keats] Bad!
- We gotta get to the emergency shutoff valve.
- [Potter] Bruckheimer.
- Can you get to it?
- Do somethin' or we're gonna lose the generator.
There's protective gear in the cargo hold.
We don't have the time.
There's no other way.
[Keats] Cooper, what're you doing?
You don't owe them this, Cooper.
[Man] Cooper, don't do it.!
[Keats] Protect yourself down there, Coop.
Protect yourself.
[Man] It's crazy, Cooper.
Come on back.
Bruckheimer.
Cargo hold.
- I'm getting something.
- [McQueen] What's its signature?
- There is no signature.
- What does your gut tell you, West?
- What's the level of threat?
- I can't tell, Colonel, without more information.
All I'm getting are microwave emissions.
Enlarge it, West.
You happen to remember the U3-78 specs?
What we have here is an unidentified blob.
Give me the U3-78 specs!
The U3-78s- uh, alien class "D" destroyer, a hunter-killer.
- Weapons package?
- Rockets, mines, guided weapons.
- What else?
- Special ops thinks she has... advanced microwave technology that screw up... communications.
Causes reactor temperatures to spike.
- Goes for the soft kill.
- My gut tells me... that your unidentified blob is a U3-78... and he's comin' in for the hard kill.
Sir, I have radar contact.
Bearing 276.
Range- two parsecs.
Azimuth 4-niner.
There's not enough power to get us out of harm's way.
There's only one way to take the load off the second generator- cut power to one section of the cargo hold.
- You mean kill people.
- It's math, Colonel.
One section dies or we all die.
Is there really a choice?
Section 46 gives us the most power for the fewest lives.
Generator Room, this is Captain Lewelyn.
Stand by to cut power to Section 46.
Repeat.
Stand by to cut power to Section 46.
Section 46 houses 12 containers of InVitros, Captain.
That's 168 lives.
It's the only way to get the reactor back online.
There has to be another way, Captain.
That's an order, Keats.
Section 46.
Stand by.
McQueen won't let this happen.
He's one of us.
You hear his voice raised in protest just now?
What did you find?
I got a sister in Section 46.
[Whirring, Grinding]
Engine Room, Bridge.
Can you go on line?
- Negative.
I can't give you power.
- It's time to pull the plug.
Keats.
This is the captain.
Cut power to Section 46.
- Negative, Captain.
- Just what the hell is the problem?
- I'm the problem, Captain.
- There's not a lot of room for interpretation in your orders.
I won't do it, Captain.
Too many of us have died fighting your wars.
You're putting every life on this ship at risk.
Then we die equal.
[Potter] Keats.!
Some are more equal than others.
[Potter Straining]
Stay right there.
Right there.
Lift him up.
Are you gonna help me save those Tanks?
Because I know one thing- you're not going to kill your own people.
Keats, confirm you're cutting power to Section 46.
Keats, answer me.
Keats, what's going on?
Cut power, or we're gonna lose the ship.
Keats.!
Keats.!
Do it, man.!
Keats.!
Keats.!
Ceramic fuel temp- 1600.
- Ashby, Sorrell, come here.
- Yes, sir.
- What's the problem?
- Sir.
Captain's giving orders to kill the InVitros in Section 46.
- You can't let him do that.
- I can't stop him!
Not alone.
[Chattering]
[Beeps, Squawks]
- Missile's launched!
- Confirm that.
They're off the rails!
Engine Room, Bridge.
Give me everything you've got.
[Vanessa] 3.6 kilotons thrust.
Maximum power.
Vansen, Wang!
Missile incoming!
Lock on!
- Bingo!
- We're locked on.
Let's rock and roll.
2100 klicks.
1800 klicks.
Colonel, launch the cargo haulers.
The missiles will go for them, not us.
Launch starboard cargo haulers.
Prepare ship for impact!
Eight, seven, six-
Fire!
Come to Mama.
- Hard left rudder.
- Hard left rudder.
[Lasers Firing]
West, radar contact?
Negative.
But the U3-78's gonna come looking for confirmation of the kill.
Good call.
I'm going aft.
- Come on.
Come on!
- You're a dead man, Keats.
A dead man.
I don't want to kill you.
I will if I have to.
- What the hell's going on?
- A change in command.
You two stand down.
I'm not taking orders from you.
You are now.
Stand down.
How can you let him kill InVitros?
Our operating systems are down, Hawkes.
The captain has no choice.
- You can stop him.
- The captain's word is law.
When someone decides to kill an InVitro... it's not my law, and it shouldn't be yours.
Keats gave you the manifest.
- Who'd you find?
- A sister.
How could you kill your own people?
How can you?
Answer me!
- [Keats] Captain.!
- [Cocks Gun]
- I'm taking the helm.
- Are you adding mutiny to your résumé, Mr. Keats?
Mutiny, Captain?
He's adding murder.
- He'll kill us all.
- Whatever it takes.
As long as InVitros don't die.
Sit him down.
Stay at your post, son.
I need you alive.
Tell McQueen you need him on the bridge.
Tell him!
[McQueen] I'll buy us a little more time.
I'll give Damphousse five minutes... to get the reactor back on line.
If she can't, I have to pull the plug.
[Lewelyn Over Radio] Colonel McQueen, report to the bridge.
- [Lewelyn] You're makin' a mistake, Keats.
- It won't be the first, sir.
[Yells]
Don't even think about it.
This isn't what I wanted.
That's not good enough.
Get your men back to their stations.
I'm taking the bridge.
- [Gun Cocks]
- I can't allow that.
[Cooper] You are not going to kill him.
And you are not going to kill the Tanks.
You can't have it both ways.
[Nathan] I'm picking up an active gamma pulse.
He's doing a Yankee search.
Yankee search is an old navy term.
The bastard who's hunting us figures we're a pile of space garbage.
He's coming in to confirm the kill.
And right now there's not a damn thing we can do.
Bridge, Fire Control.
Fire light status-red.!
Repeat.
Fire light red.
Get us power.
What does the colonel want us to do now?
Throw rocks?
Pretty soon you're going to have to decide if you're gonna kill us.
- Pulse intervals decreasing.
- Clock's running out, Hawkes.
Time to decide.
Whose side are you on?
There are no sides, Colonel.
Just right and wrong.
Give me the gun.
The colonel will do the right thing.
You have to trust that.
Do you, Cooper?
Do you trust him?
Yes.
Don't make it worse.
Sir, the bridge is yours.
Thank you, Mr. Hawkes.
Engine Room, Bridge.
We have incoming.
Get me back online.
No can do.!
Pressure shocks hit the primary system hard.
This whole damn thing's gonna melt down if I don't get some help here.
We work together... or we die.
It's that simple.
I need your help, Mr. Keats.
Be good enough to get your men back to the engine room.
Fire Control, Bridge.
The captain's dead.
We have a class nine emergency.
Report to the engine room or the nuclear reactor's gonna melt down.
Maybe later you'll tell us what the hell is going on.
You ever try to do the right thing, only it turns out wrong?
Kick in the emergency core coolant system in... five, four, three... two, one-
Now!
Reload initiated.
[Exhales]
Glad to have you back.
Bridge, Engine Room. 90 minutes to get your reactor back on line.
- [Nathan] He's coming right at us.!
- Can't fight.
We can't run.
And your five minutes are up.
Now what the hell do you expect me to do?
Cut power to another section.
Pop quiz, Hawkes.
You cut power to Section 46, 168 Tanks die.
You cut the power to any other section, 400 humans die.
Now, how does the math work out?
What do you do?
We're dead center in the gamma pulse.
We have one advantage, Hawkes.
The U3-78 doesn't know we're ready to fight.
Are we?
Are we ready to fight?
[Machines Whirring]
[Hawkes Over P.A.] Power's cut to Section 46.
We have generator power, sir.
Bridge, Fire Control.
Fire light green.
[McQueen Over Radio] Hold your fire until the U3-78 closes.
At two klicks, he can't fire his missiles.
Solar flare.
I got no screen.
We lost the targeting system.
The solar flare scrambled the screen.
The only way the U3-78 can make contact is visual.
Right now, we are not on his radar screen.
Estimated time for his radar retrieval- three minutes.
We're blind and he's blind.
Let's play a little hide-and-seek.
Hard left rudder.
- Hard left rudder, sir.
- Fire Control, Bridge.
We don't know where she is, but she's out there.
Lower the blast shield!
[Mercer] Lowering the blast shield, sir.
He's coming right at us.
Wang!
Vansen!
Bogey bears 3-3-niner.
1.5 klicks, ayimuth 90 degrees.
Weapons hold.
Fire perigee kick motor, Mr. Mercer.
- Sir, we'll break up.
- Fire perigee kick motor!
- Come on.
Give the order.
- What's he waiting for?
Weapons hold.
Weapons hold.
Now!
Fire!
Fire!
All screens are clear.
[Damphousse] Pressure's at 18.5.
Climbing.
The core temp's cooling.
Bridge, Engine Room.
The reactor's stabilized.
We have 90 mikes until we're on line.
[McQueen] Good work, Damphousse.
I had a little help from my friends, sir.
There's gonna be hell to pay.
It was my call, Sorrell.
I'll take the responsibility.
We stand together.
- Plot a new course, Mr. Harkin.
- Yes, sir.
West.
Launching the cargo haulers was a great countermeasure.
I thought I had to make a point.
No.
You were right.
What I did- going after her- was selfish.
It won't happen again.
I know that, West.
Thanks.
My pleasure.

No, the way I see it... you'll only end up with a broken heart, and I don't have the time.
You did the right thing.
We're marines, Cooper.
Not Tanks.
What's gonna happen to Keats?
Keats and Ashby will stand trial for mutiny.
Sorrell, for murder.
Sorry f-
I'm sorry.
What would you know about sorrow?
I know this much.
I never had the... courage to look for my family.
Not because I was afraid of what I might find... but because I was afraid of what I might feel.
Kate.
Kate.
I'm sorry.
[Man] Watch your hands.
Watch your hands.
- We're cutting it pretty close.
- Man, I don't wanna miss my ride.
- The Mac Arthur will wait for us.
- They gotta wait.
I've been T.D.Y. on Groombridge 34 since April.
- You goin' Earthside?
- Haven't seen my wife since before the war.
She's probably forgotten what I look like.
I know.
I know.
In my case, maybe that's a good thing.
Still, it'll be nice to have dinner at home.
Man, would I love a meal that wasn't freeze-dried.
Just havin' a break's gonna be good.
Take cover!
Take cover!
Chig snipers in the tower!
Chig snipers in the tower!
Cooper, Monk, cover the right flank.
Vansen, West, take the left.
Monk, keep down!
Medic!
No.
Come on.
- Hold on!
- I'm not gonna die.
Not yet.
Please, not yet.
- Medic!
- Cooper, don't leave me.
Don't let me die alone.
Two migs morphine.
Lasix, 80 mills, I.V. push.
- Vitals?
- His name's Solomon Monk.
He doesn't need a doctor, Lieutenant.
He needs a rabbi.
- L-Look, maybe there's a chance...
- These men have a chance.
Tell my wife I don't mind goin' except for her.
Sh-She was my... my wife.
Cooper!
We're takin' off in five.
We're hitching' a ride on a cargo ship.
He's dead.
His family will want these.
Come on.
Let's go.
58th, you're clear for docking.
Captain Lewelyn, I'm Colonel McQueen... 58th Air Commando Group en route from Fire Base Langston to the carrier Saratoga.
I waited for you, Colonel.
I didn't want you to miss your ride.
- How bad is it down below?
- Langston's still hot.
I lost a good man to a sniper tonight.
We have new orders.
Our course will take us through Blood Alley.
It's dangerous, but it's the only way out.
I don't suppose there's a chance of a fighter escort?
- Not in this lifetime.
- Careful of that!
Sixteen pounds prime rib.
- Black market.
- What'd that cost you?
I traded my only 1986 Dan Fouts card.
Better be pretty good prime rib.
InVitros.
You've come to the right place.
Every man down here's a Tank.
- J.J. Keats.
- Hawkes.
Cooper Hawkes.
Ashby!
The engine room foreman.
- Howdy.
- Sorrell, Chief Engineer.
- Everyone on the crew a Tank?
- Six of us.
Seven humans including the captain.
Computers do the rest of the work.
Ever notice how Tanks always get the dirty jobs?
Isn't that why we were made?
You got that right.
You did good for yourself.
There's no trick becoming chief petty officer on a tramp steamer.
Do the dirty jobs, keep your mouth shut, go along.
Captain Lewelyn...
better than most.
I got a standing invitation to take meals in the captain's mess.
Most of the cargo is humans suspended in cryogenic sleep.
They put you under, five years later, you wake up.
It's the next day of your life.
We're carrying six containers of unborn InVitros.
They're being shipped to a plutonium mining facility... in the Corvus star system.
They don't stand a chance.
What're a few Tanks, more or less?
- Do you know who they are?
- Right now they're just numbers on a cargo manifest.
Can't believe InVitros are still being shipped like that.
Set course for the Canis Majoris star system.
Plotting course for Canis Majoris star system.
- Bring us to 260 A.U.'s.
- Aye, aye, sir. 260 A.U.'s.
Plot course heading 2-1-fiver.
That's Blood Alley.
The nav-channel's 200 klicks wide.
Things change, Potter.
There's a war on.
Captain, that course takes us between Adhara and Aludra.
The hydrogen gasses play havoc with the radio communication.
The solar flares screw up the onboard computers.
It's the fastest way from Groombridge 34...
- to the battleship Saratoga.
- I don't recall hiring on for a suicide mission.
When I give an order, Mr. Potter, be so good as to follow it.
Plot a course heading 2-1-fiver, Mr. Harkin.
All ahead full, Mr. Mercer.
All ahead full.
Quite a cargo you've got here.
First five years out of the tank...
I worked the uranium mines at Omicron Draconis.
Thirty four of us were shipped out.
Six came back.
I don't know if there's a hell, but if there is, I've already been there.
That was before the World Federation banned indentured servitude, Colonel.
The InVitros I'm hauling signed on for the job.
You have a cargo of unborn, Captain.
What did they sign on for?
Janice loved your present.
I took her to Detroit Disneyland for her birthday.
She loved Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
I miss you.
You're still my favorite wild ride.
- My boyfriend's little girl.
- She's cute.
Yeah.
She still misses her mother though, big time.
She'll learn to love you.
Love isn't learned, Nathan.
It just is.
How can you fall in love with someone you've never met?
Martie and I talk every day.
You met her through a personals ad in SpaceNet, Wang.
You don't even know what she looks like.
I love the way she thinks.
She's got a great sense of humor.
Okay, let's say that you guys get along great at seven light-years.
What happens when you have to sit across a table eye to eye?
How will you know how to act with each other?
Is that a question or a confession?
You writing' Monk's wife?
How do you know what to put?
I tell his wife he was a good man and will be missed.
Is that what it says in the regs?
No.
That's what it says here.
How do you know what humans are feeling?
I see the laughter and tears, and I know.
I don't feel that stuff.
They take us out of the tank at 18, Hawkes.
You can't get 18 years back in a day.
Do you ever wonder what it would be like... to have a mother or a father?
I don't think about what never was.
But... it don't bother you that when you die... there's gonna be no blood relation there to say words over you?
The Corps is my family, Hawkes.
The men and women I served with will know what to say.
Yeah, you got that right.
It's great to have real food, Captain.
Captain... the invitro manifest...
- Cooper, not now.
- I'd like to see it.
You know what he's tryin' to do, Captain.
The same thing they all do...
look for family.
No offense, but, uh... how can something grown in a tank consider itself related to anything else?
Except maybe algae.
Stuff a sock in it, Potter.
What the hell...
Take a damage control team aft.
Secure the cargo hold.
Coolant temp's spiked to 700!
- Step the rods down.
- Got it.
- Take it off-line.
- Going off-line.
Generator Room, go to secondary power.
All right, come on, Clyde.
Don't fail me now.
Backup generators have kicked in.
Engine Room, Bridge.
Reactor's scrammed.
We're off line.
Core's unstable.
- What hit us?
- Solar flare.
What else can one expect when flying between two unstable suns?
- I want you midship with Keats.
- Yes, sir.
- What's your weapons package?
- Two laser pulse cannons, unmanned.
Vansen!
Wang!
With your permission, Captain.
Just in case that wasn't a solar flare.
Under the circumstances, I think there's room for two on the bridge.
- Damphousse.
- I know, Colonel.
Engine room.
Hawkes, I want you to go work with Keats.
I want one of us on damage control.
- Keats is one of us.
- He's a civilian.
We're marines.
And Hawkes, forget the invitro manifest.
The 58th is your family.
Looking for a past you never lived can only get you hurt.
Feeling pain's part of being human.
Who said you're human?
Hey, where're you goin'?
What about Section 46?
We don't inspect it?
People are the priority here.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Tanks aren't people.
Look, you just stay away, pal.
You got no business over there.
What the hell is going on here?
Navigator was right.
White light solar flare.
I know what the machine says.
What do you say?
- There's no way to tell.
- Trust your instincts, West.
That's how you stay alive.
There's something out there.
I can feel it.
- Engine Room, Bridge.
- Core temperature's stabilized.
Estimate to get the reactor on line?
Maybe today.
Maybe Malaba Day.
- Stored energy?
- 4.5 kilotons in the containment vessel.
- Keep the engine on line.
- Yes, sir!
Clad temp... 600.
Let's go back online.
Don't know what caused the coolant temp to spike.
It could happen again.
Worst thing that can happen is we could blow up, Mr. Ashby.
Then I don't see the problem.
The coolant density's at 800 kilograms over M³.
I think we're in the clear.
Let's do it.
Raise Rod 1.
Rod 1 raised.
Raise Rod 2.
Rod 2 raised.
You know your stuff.
Bridge, this is Fire Control.
Request permission for a weapons check.
Fire Control, Bridge.
Permission granted.
Fire light status... green.
- Fire light status... green.
- Commence firing.
Bucks like a mule.
West, anything?
I'd have better luck reading tea leaves, sir.
At least tea leaves would tell us something.
Let me see that.
She the girl you went AWOL for?
Yes, sir.
This is behind you.
The only thing on your mind is that radar screen.
I figured you'd show up.
The Tank cargo manifest.
The number on the left's the date of conception.
The middle number's the gene pool.
This is the batch number on the right.
Place of conception is indicated in the margin.
I've been lookin' 10 years, Cooper, so I know what you're feelin'.
You're wondering what it would be like to have family.
Only all the time.
What are you?
March 6, 2040.
Gene pool 16A.
Batch Alpha-3439.
The Philadelphia facility.
Brooklyn facility.
Not that it really matters.
All I know is that somewhere there's someone who's D.N.A. reads...
A-T, C-G, T-A, G-C, C-G, A-T... that's black hair and hazel green eyes.
See, I know what my family would be like, but I can't find them.
Enjoy the read.
Hand me a reverse torque wrench.
Here's what I think.
Human beings are nothing more than highly evolved animals.
- Tell that to Einstein.
- We're attracted to a person because the way that they look.
The way that they smell.
The way that they feel to the touch.
Okay, so what's your point?
How can you fall in love with a woman that you met on SpaceNet?
You don't believe in the soul?
In spiritual connection?
I believe in what you can reach out and touch.
Then reach out and touch that morph head.
- I'm getting something.
- Range and bearing?
Looks like an energy pulse, Colonel.
I can't get an exact reading.
- It's gone.
- Just tell me what you saw.
I don't know!
Solar spike.
I need to know what's out there, West.
Figure it out.
Ceramic fuel temp...
1200 and holding.
Bridge, Engine Room.
Reactor's on line.
Well done, Damphousse.
I'll need full power.
- Full power.
- So, how come you got detailed down here?
Four years at Caltech.
Two summers I interned at San Onofre.
What kind of lunatic interns at a nuclear power plant?
My father was chief engineer.
Lot of people won't work with nipple-necks.
Let me tell you something, Mr. Ashby.
I'll work with anyone who wants to work.
Not a lot of people feel that way.
I'm not a lot of people.
What is it with you people?
How can you expect to be a marine?
You can't follow a simple order?
Huh?
Don't ever touch me again.
Oh, and what's so special about you?
I got a petri dish.
I can always make another Tank.
Scram it!
Bridge, Engine Room.
Scrammed.
- Taking all systems off-line.
- Generator Room, Bridge.
- Go to secondary power supply!
- Doing it now.
Captain, fire in the generator room!
Potter, this is the captain.
Get a fire team to Station 4.
Help!
Aaah!
- How bad is it?
- Bad!
- We gotta get to the emergency shutoff valve.
- Bruckheimer.
- Can you get to it?
- Do somethin' or we're gonna lose the generator.
There's protective gear in the cargo hold.
We don't have the time.
There's no other way.
Cooper, what're you doing?
You don't owe them this, Cooper.
Cooper, don't do it!
Protect yourself down there, Coop.
Protect yourself.
It's crazy, Cooper.
Come on back.
Bruckheimer.
Cargo hold.
- I'm getting something.
- What's its signature?
- There is no signature.
- What does your gut tell you, West?
- What's the level of threat?
- I can't tell, Colonel, without more information.
All I'm getting are microwave emissions.
Enlarge it, West.
You happen to remember the U3-78 specs?
What we have here is an unidentified blob.
Give me the U3-78 specs!
The U3-78s... uh, alien class "D" destroyer, a hunter-killer.
- Weapons package?
- Rockets, mines, guided weapons.
- What else?
- Special ops thinks she has... advanced microwave technology that screw up... communications.
Causes reactor temperatures to spike.
- Goes for the soft kill.
- My gut tells me... that your unidentified blob is a U3-78... and he's comin' in for the hard kill.
Sir, I have radar contact.
Bearing 276.
Range... two parsecs.
Azimuth 4-niner.
There's not enough power to get us out of harm's way.
There's only one way to take the load off the second generator... cut power to one section of the cargo hold.
- You mean kill people.
- It's math, Colonel.
One section dies or we all die.
Is there really a choice?
Section 46 gives us the most power for the fewest lives.
Generator Room, this is Captain Lewelyn.
Stand by to cut power to Section 46.
Repeat.
Stand by to cut power to Section 46.
Section 46 houses 12 containers of InVitros, Captain.
That's 168 lives.
It's the only way to get the reactor back online.
There has to be another way, Captain.
That's an order, Keats.
Section 46.
Stand by.
McQueen won't let this happen.
He's one of us.
You hear his voice raised in protest just now?
What did you find?
I got a sister in Section 46.
Engine Room, Bridge.
Can you go on line?
- Negative.
I can't give you power.
- It's time to pull the plug.
Keats.
This is the captain.
Cut power to Section 46.
- Negative, Captain.
- Just what the hell is the problem?
- I'm the problem, Captain.
- There's not a lot of room for interpretation in your orders.
I won't do it, Captain.
Too many of us have died fighting your wars.
You're putting every life on this ship at risk.
Then we die equal.
Keats!
Some are more equal than others.
Stay right there.
Right there.
Lift him up.
Are you gonna help me save those Tanks?
Because I know one thing...
you're not going to kill your own people.
Keats, confirm you're cutting power to Section 46.
Keats, answer me.
Keats, what's going on?
Cut power, or we're gonna lose the ship.
Keats!
Keats!
Do it, man!
Keats!
Keats!
Ceramic fuel temp... 1600.
- Ashby, Sorrell, come here.
- Yes, sir.
- What's the problem?
- Sir.
Captain's giving orders to kill the InVitros in Section 46.
- You can't let him do that.
- I can't stop him!
Not alone.
- Missile's launched!
- Confirm that.
They're off the rails!
Engine Room, Bridge.
Give me everything you've got.
3.6 kilotons thrust.
Maximum power.
Vansen, Wang!
Missile incoming!
Lock on!
- Bingo!
- We're locked on.
Let's rock and roll.
2100 klicks.
1800 klicks.
Colonel, launch the cargo haulers.
The missiles will go for them, not us.
Launch starboard cargo haulers.
Prepare ship for impact!
Eight, seven, six...
Fire!
Come to Mama.
- Hard left rudder.
- Hard left rudder.
West, radar contact?
Negative.
But the U3-78's gonna come looking for confirmation of the kill.
Good call.
I'm going aft.
- Come on.
Come on!
- You're a dead man, Keats.
A dead man.
I don't want to kill you.
I will if I have to.
- What the hell's going on?
- A change in command.
You two stand down.
I'm not taking orders from you.
You are now.
Stand down.
How can you let him kill InVitros?
Our operating systems are down, Hawkes.
The captain has no choice.
- You can stop him.
- The captain's word is law.
When someone decides to kill an InVitro... it's not my law, and it shouldn't be yours.
Keats gave you the manifest.
- Who'd you find?
- A sister.
How could you kill your own people?
How can you?
Answer me!
Captain!
- I'm taking the helm.
- Are you adding mutiny to your résumé, Mr. Keats?
Mutiny, Captain?
He's adding murder.
- He'll kill us all.
- Whatever it takes.
As long as InVitros don't die.
Sit him down.
Stay at your post, son.
I need you alive.
Tell McQueen you need him on the bridge.
Tell him!
I'll buy us a little more time.
I'll give Damphousse five minutes... to get the reactor back on line.
If she can't, I have to pull the plug.
Colonel McQueen, report to the bridge.
- You're makin' a mistake, Keats.
- It won't be the first, sir.
Don't even think about it.
This isn't what I wanted.
That's not good enough.
Get your men back to their stations.
I'm taking the bridge.
I can't allow that.
You are not going to kill him.
And you are not going to kill the Tanks.
You can't have it both ways.
I'm picking up an active gamma pulse.
He's doing a Yankee search.
Yankee search is an old navy term.
The bastard who's hunting us figures we're a pile of space garbage.
He's coming in to confirm the kill.
And right now there's not a damn thing we can do.
Bridge, Fire Control.
Fire light status... red!
Repeat.
Fire light red.
Get us power.
What does the colonel want us to do now?
Throw rocks?
Pretty soon you're going to have to decide if you're gonna kill us.
- Pulse intervals decreasing.
- Clock's running out, Hawkes.
Time to decide.
Whose side are you on?
There are no sides, Colonel.
Just right and wrong.
Give me the gun.
The colonel will do the right thing.
You have to trust that.
Do you, Cooper?
Do you trust him?
Yes.
Don't make it worse.
Sir, the bridge is yours.
Thank you, Mr. Hawkes.
Engine Room, Bridge.
We have incoming.
Get me back online.
No can do!
Pressure shocks hit the primary system hard.
This whole damn thing's gonna melt down if I don't get some help here.
We work together... or we die.
It's that simple.
I need your help, Mr. Keats.
Be good enough to get your men back to the engine room.
Fire Control, Bridge.
The captain's dead.
We have a class nine emergency.
Report to the engine room or the nuclear reactor's gonna melt down.
Maybe later you'll tell us what the hell is going on.
You ever try to do the right thing, only it turns out wrong?
Kick in the emergency core coolant system in... five, four, three... two, one...
Now!
Reload initiated.
Glad to have you back.
Bridge, Engine Room. 90 minutes to get your reactor back on line.
- He's coming right at us!
- Can't fight.
We can't run.
And your five minutes are up.
Now what the hell do you expect me to do?
Cut power to another section.
Pop quiz, Hawkes.
You cut power to Section 46, 168 Tanks die.
You cut the power to any other section, 400 humans die.
Now, how does the math work out?
What do you do?
We're dead center in the gamma pulse.
We have one advantage, Hawkes.
The U3-78 doesn't know we're ready to fight.
Are we?
Are we ready to fight?
Power's cut to Section 46.
We have generator power, sir.
Bridge, Fire Control.
Fire light green.
Hold your fire until the U3-78 closes.
At two klicks, he can't fire his missiles.
Solar flare.
I got no screen.
We lost the targeting system.
The solar flare scrambled the screen.
The only way the U3-78 can make contact is visual.
Right now, we are not on his radar screen.
Estimated time for his radar retrieval... three minutes.
We're blind and he's blind.
Let's play a little hide-and-seek.
Hard left rudder.
- Hard left rudder, sir.
- Fire Control, Bridge.
We don't know where she is, but she's out there.
Lower the blast shield!
Lowering the blast shield, sir.
He's coming right at us.
Wang!
Vansen!
Bogey bears 3-3-niner.
1.5 klicks, azimuth 90 degrees.
Weapons hold.
Fire perigee kick motor, Mr. Mercer.
- Sir, we'll break up.
- Fire perigee kick motor!
- Come on.
Give the order.
- What's he waiting for?
Weapons hold.
Weapons hold.
Now!
Fire!
Fire!
All screens are clear.
Pressure's at 18.5.
Climbing.
The core temp's cooling.
Bridge, Engine Room.
The reactor's stabilized.
We have 90 mikes until we're on line.
Good work, Damphousse.
I had a little help from my friends, sir.
There's gonna be hell to pay.
It was my call, Sorrell.
I'll take the responsibility.
We stand together.
- Plot a new course, Mr. Harkin.
- Yes, sir.
West.
Launching the cargo haulers was a great countermeasure.
I thought I had to make a point.
No.
You were right.
What I did... going after her...
was selfish.
It won't happen again.
I know that, West.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
"How many loved your moments of glad grace...
"and loved your beauty with love false or true;
"but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you... and loved the sorrows of your changing face."
Try sending that via SpaceNet.
The way I figure it, if you've had bad times and joy... then you've lived.
No, the way I see it... you'll only end up with a broken heart, and I don't have the time.
You did the right thing.
We're marines, Cooper.
Not Tanks.
What's gonna happen to Keats?
Keats and Ashby will stand trial for mutiny.
Sorrell, for murder.
Sorry f...
I'm sorry.
What would you know about sorrow?
I know this much.
I never had the... courage to look for my family.
Not because I was afraid of what I might find... but because I was afraid of what I might feel.
Kate.
Kate.
I'm sorry.
Watch your hands.
Watch your hands.
Morris.
Morris, I need to talk to you.
Morris, it's me.
Are you there?
Morris?
Morris, if you're in there, open the damn door.
Morris!
Morris.
Morris, I need to talk to you.
Gail Anne is dead.
It's my fault.
Morris!
Morris, I need to talk to you.
Come to the door, Morris, please.
Answer the door, damn it!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, God, no.
No, no.
God, no.
Please, no!
No, no, no!
Please, no!
Please!
Two apparent abductions in less than a month, and then this one last night.
According to my contact, the Richmond P.D.'s hit a brick wall.
- So I told them we'd come down and have a look.
- Who's your contact?
Her name is Kelly Ryan.
She was one of my students when I was teaching at the academy.
She's just been bumped up to detective, and she's a little nervous... about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
- I've heard a lot about you.
We'll talk later.
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, age 52.
He's a top executive with Morly Tobacco up from Raleigh-Durham for a meeting.
- He arrived on an evening train.
- How do you know he's missing?
He set a wake-up call for 6:00 A.M. This morning.
When the operator tried to place it, there was no answer.
Mmm, Scotch.
It looks like he barely touched it.
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
They waited three hours before sending hotel security up.
The door was locked, security chain fastened.
And when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.
- Windows?
- Locked from the inside.
We're six stories up.
No fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.
Agent Scully, what are you looking at?
Uh, the heat register.
- You don't think anyone could have squeezed in there?
- You never know.
You guys turn up any forensics evidence at all?
Just... this.
Hey, Scully, look at this.
- What is it?
- We don't know.
The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr. Newirth checked in.
And there were similar burn marks at each of the previous crime scenes.
Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
No.
According to his wife, he loathed cigarettes.
That's strange for a man who worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?
- Yes, sir.
It's mostly carbon with some potassium and trace minerals.
It could be the residue from burnt human flesh.
Does this look like an arm to anybody?
- An arm?
- What are you thinking, Mulder?
This burn mark.
It's right where I'd be... if I was standing here answering the door, right?
- Yes.
- And I wouldn't be looking out... the peephole unless there was something to look at, right?
That makes sense.
Detective Ryan, could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
- Of course.
- And can you run those against Mr. Newirth's?
Do you have Mr. Newirth's prints?
We got them from his toiletries and check-in slip.
Okay.
Can you check all those against all hotel employees and registered guests?
Anything else?
Yeah.
Do you have the name of the last missing person?
Uh... that would be Margaret Wysnecki.
Thanks.
This should do it.
Is this your first case, Detective?
- Yes, sir.
- Any idea why they gave it to you?
No one else wanted it.
Because of the lack of evidence, this is still officially a missing persons case, not likely to end up on the front page of the daily paper.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Can I ask what you think may have happened?
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.
You're doing just fine.
- Having a little fun?
- What are you talking about?
- Spontaneous human combustion?
- I have over a dozen case files... of human bodies reduced to ash without any attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.
Let's just forget for the moment that there's no scientific theory to support it.
Okay.
Hey, Scully, can you spare a prophylactic?
What are the odds of that, huh?
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.
Check this out.
My newest tool in the fight against crime. $49.95 at your local hardware store.
Neat trick.
For your birthday I'll buy you a utility belt.
- Look at this, Mulder.
- Hmm.
- What do we know about the victim?
- Margaret Wysnecki.
Age 66.
Widowed.
Retired from Laramie Tobacco... where she worked the production line for 36 years.
Tobacco?
Patrick Newirth worked for Morly Tobacco, didn't he?
Yeah, but half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks.
- May be just a coincidence.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, was an engineer for Polarity Magnetics, Inc.
They didn't find any prints in here or anywhere else in the house.
What makes you think the prints on the bulb mean anything?
I don't know.
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.
"M. Wysnecki. " Round-trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia.
Return train dated March 17.
- That's the day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came into town by train, didn't he?
And Gail Anne Lambert.
Uh, no.
It doesn't say anything here that puts her anywhere near the Richmond train station.
- Maybe that was a detail that was overlooked.
- So what's the significance?
Maybe these people aren't just disappearing.
Maybe they're being hunted, and the hunter's working the train station.
And whatever happened to spontaneous human combustion?
Maybe it's not so spontaneous.
Get on the phone to your young detective... and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.
In an alley near the train station.
I'm gonna check him out.
Roger that, 64.
I'm on my way.
Sir, could I speak with you?
- Hold on.
I only wanna ask you a couple of questions!
All right.
Stop right there.
Don't move.
Just hold it.
Put your hands in the air, sir.
Stay away from me.
What do you think you're doing?
All right.
Come on out of there.
We just want to talk to you.
Stay away from me!
I don't want to hurt you.
- Move it!
- Hands where we can see them.
Please.
I'm warning you.
I'm a dangerous man.
Keep moving, pal, out where we can see you.
All right.
I want you to lie face down on the ground.
Don't come any closer.
Get down on the ground, sir.
Now!
Please, you don't understand.
- Oh, God, no!
- Barney!
Don't!
No!
Stay away!
Oh, God.
No.
No.
Help!
God, not again!
No!
God!
No!
No!
No!
No!
What happened here, Kelly?
I sent two patrolmen down here last night like you told me.
They lost radio contact with them just after midnight.
All they found this morning was two more scorch marks on the pavement.
- Nothing else?
- No.
Suddenly this looks like it could be a cop killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.
- Well, you were just doing your job.
- Yeah?
They want to know on what suspicions I sent these men down here.
If I tell them I'm involved with the FBI, they're gonna snap.
- The prints you pulled from that lightbulb.
- I ran it... against all the hotel staff and guests, then through the national databases.
No match.
Some first case, huh?
You just make sure you hang on to this case.
I'm sure something will turn up.
- These ideas of yours, Mulder.
You care to share them?
- Not yet.
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully.
I was right about that.
All right.
Where does this leave us?
Maybe with enough to identify the killer.
- How?
- He was here last night.
He was also probably here on March 17 and March 31.
Those were the days Margaret Wysnecki and Patrick Newirth disappeared.
That leaves three train station videotapes to cross-reference and hopefully find this guy.
That's assuming we're looking for a guy.
Either way, the security camera's our only witness.
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.
Or none of them.
We've gone through the entire week, and I'm still not sure how you expect to find him.
That's it for March 22 on the arrival deck.
Okay.
Let's go back to the terminal tape.
Again?
He's gotta be on at least one of these tapes.
Chances are he's not walking around carrying a sign with an arrow on it.
There you go.
See, this guy.
Right here.
He's always here.
What's he doing?
Looking at the floor.
Why's he doing that?
Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.
Can you freeze this and blow it up 200º/º?
Sure.
Okay.
Can you reframe and blow it up some more?
See, he's got something in his jacket right there.
I'll see if I can pull it up.
Polarity Magnetics.
That's where the first victim worked.
Looks like it's been closed up.
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.
We're looking for a man who may have worked here.
When was this taken?
March 22.
Do you know him?
Sure I know him.
Dr. Chester Banton.
He was my business partner.
You mean he's not anymore?
I don't know.
I would assume not.
This is the first I've seen him in five weeks.
I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
How's that?
Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.
Polarity Magnetics does, or did, primarily two kinds of research.
Mostly we were designing mag-lev applications... people movers, bullet trains... but for Chester that was just a way to pay the bills... for the really theoretical stuff he was interested in.
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter... quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks.
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.
Theoretically, the very building blocks of reality.
Except no one knows if they truly exist.
Chester was sure they did.
So sure, he bet his life on it.
This is where it happened.
Chester was working to isolate a new particle.
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.
One fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in a space the size of a Wal-Mart.
Powered by what?
A couple billion megawatts.
Virginia Power loved us.
Exactly what happened here?
Well, the work involved the bombardment of beta particles... with an alpha target...
negative against positive.
Chester had everything set and had started the countdown... when he realized he had made a mistake.
There was something that needed adjusting in the target room.
Except you can't stop the countdown once you've begun.
There was time to safely make the change, but I'd left the room for a minute... when Chester decided to go in.
I didn't realize until it was too late... that the door had locked behind him.
Look at this.
As far as I can tell, it burned Chester's shadow right into the wall.
How did he survive?
All I can figure is, the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass... that they slid right through his body.
- Like getting an X-ray.
- A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.
When I looked at the monitor and saw what was happening... that Chester was trapped in here...
I panicked.
I cut the power, but it was too late.
I remember looking and seeing Chester.
He was perfectly calm, almost like he wanted it to happen... like he was finally going to experience... the dark matter he had theorized in some kind of physical way... as if the truth might come into him.
Excuse me.
What do you think, Scully?
Well, this looks like the same kind of material... that they found at each of the other crime scenes.
Maybe what we're dealing with is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.
I'm less convinced of that now.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr. Chester Ray Banton.
Maybe even part of him.
Well, whatever it is, we have to find it.
I know of only one place to start looking.
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.
- What are you looking at?
- On the videotape, Dr. Banton kept staring at the floor.
I'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.
Well, maybe the exposure affected his mind.
Nonsensical repetitive behavior is a common trait of mental illness.
You trying to tell me something?
I called Detective Ryan.
She's having the prints on the lightbulbs checked against Banton's.
Did you tell her about Dr. Banton's accident?
No.
I only told her that he was a possible suspect... and that it was a bit too early to get her hopes up... and that right now we have more questions than we do answers.
- Like?
- Like a motive, like a murder weapon, like...
What if Dr. Banton...
Look here.
- There are hardly any shadows cast.
- What do you mean?
The lighting in here is diffused... soft light.
- I wonder if that's what Dr. Banton was looking for.
- Looking for his shadow?
Dr. Banton.
Stop right there!
Dr. Banton!
Please, just leave me alone.
We're federal agents, Dr. Banton.
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.
Stay away from me.
Wait!
It'll kill you.
It doesn't care who you are.
Oh, thank God.
I thought the orders were to keep this patient in the dark.
He insisted on soft light.
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.
How can you even begin to understand what it's like?
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.
Living like a bum.
Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.
The accident in the lab...
the quanta bombardment.
You believe that altered you physically?
You could, you could say that.
Can you tell us how?
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.
But it has something to do with dark matter.
It has everything to do with dark matter.
My shadow... isn't mine.
It's, it's like a black hole.
It splits molecules into component atoms.
It unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.
That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
It wasn't me.
Gail Anne was my colleague.
She...
The night after the accident, I went to see her.
I was just standing in the doorway.
I was looking right at her.
And then she was gone.
You have no control over it?
If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people?
All I can do is... study it.
Try and divine its, its true nature before they do.
"They"?
The government.
They're after me.
And when they find me, they're going to do the brain suck they've just been dying to do.
"Brain suck"?
For the purpose of?
For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish.
And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.
- But if they, they killed you, then wouldn't your shadow just...
- Disappear?
Who knows?
That's why you have to get me out of here.
If I die, there could be nothing left to tether this thing.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to ask you to discontinue your interrogation of the suspect.
This is Detective Barron.
He's the primary on this case.
Yeah, I was just wondering what your involvement is here.
- We caught the guy.
- I appreciate that, but no one seems to be able to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.
Agent Mulder and I are here strictly in an unofficial capacity.
And who brought you in?
We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.
Well, Banton's prints place him at two of the crime scenes, and Transit Authority tapes show him in the immediate vicinity... of two of the most recent victims.
- So I say this case is looking pretty much explained.
- Really?
Have you talked to Dr. Banton?
I hope you're not trying to interrogate me, Agent Mulder, because I'm not the suspect.
I don't think you know anything about this case, which is why you stuck it... with Detective Ryan, and I think you should allow her to decide how to proceed.
Detective Ryan is handling this case.
She's done well, and I see no reason not to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred.
Transferred?
Where?
To the city jail in preparation for his arraignment.
I don't think you appreciate this man's condition or the danger he poses.
I don't think you have the authority to tell me... or anyone else in my unit how to do our job.
I think we can handle it from here, Agent Mulder.
We'll call you if there's anything more you can do.
Come on, Mulder.
Let's go.
Soft light.
He needs soft light.
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- What do you mean?
Putting Detective Ryan's ambition ahead of all good sense in this case.
Ambition?
She's a woman trying to survive the boy's club, Mulder.
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- The difference is... you never put yourself ahead of your work, and that's what's happening here.
Look.
The fact is we have no jurisdiction here.
- We were called in as a favor.
- And as a favor, we just handed over the A-bomb to the Boy Scouts.
I'm sure all the necessary precautions will be taken.
I'm sure that Robert Oppenheimer got similar reassurances from his government... the same government that Dr. Banton is afraid of.
- You don't believe all this paranoia about brain sucking.
- That man is scared, and it's not just of his own shadow.
Mulder, as brilliant as Dr. Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional.
He demonstrated just about every textbook indicator back there.
We've both seen the physical evidence, Scully.
Look.
I don't know how to explain it, but that's not our job.
I don't know what else we should do.
I think I do.
All you've given me is a name...
Chester Ray Banton.
- Dr. Chester Ray Banton.
Do you know him?
- No.
Should I?
He's being held by the Richmond Police in connection with several bizarre murders.
He's a physicist... researching quarks, gluons... dark matter.
He believes the government is out to get him.
It's tax season.
So do most Americans.
He believes his life is in danger.
- Is he a dangerous man?
- Yes.
Where is he being held?
At the Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital, but not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- Why?
The last time I helped you, I bloodied my fists... and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.
Yes, I know, and you can trust them as you trust me.
I promise.
Dead men can't keep promises.
The next time, the blood and regret could be yours.
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.
I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you.
Promise you won't contact me again unless absolutely necessary.
Promise.
Frank, are your lights on down there?
Ours just went...
Hi.
We're here to transfer Chester Ray Banton.
I have orders he's not being transferred until tomorrow.
Due to the power outage, there's been a change of plans.
No one's supposed to go in there!
Here.
Quickly.
Who are you?
No.
Don't do this.
Please.
Please, no!
No, don't!
Leave me alone!
Please!
- Mulder.
- What did you find out, Scully?
Richmond P.D. Had two officers outside watching the entrance.
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- According to the floor nurse, there were three men.
Three?
The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks from here.
Somebody posing as a city engineer.
Somebody who would have access to plans for Virginia Power... so they could take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.
Somebody from the government coming for Dr. Banton?
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, Scully, but my guess is he was unsuccessful and Dr. Banton's on the loose.
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her leave.
She was in charge of Dr. Banton's transfer and arraignment this morning.
She's in some pretty hot water.
Maybe that was an appointment he was never meant to keep.
- Let's go.
- Where?
Mulder, wait.
- Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr. Banton said last night.
- I heard him say a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head, Scully.
I think the only reason he hasn't tried to kill himself... is because he's afraid his death will release the dark matter.
Wait a second.
That's still just a theory, and it's a pretty wild one at that.
Whether or not Dr. Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.
And apparently so does whoever it is who tried to take him last night.
All that he's been trying to do since the accident is try to control this thing.
If he escapes, he's gonna go where he thinks he can do that, and we gotta get there first.
Don't turn on the light, Chris.
Not unless you want to die.
Chester, what the hell is going on?
The FBI have been looking for you.
Where have you been?
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.
What's this about, Chester?
You're acting crazy.
Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris.
It's real.
We found it.
- What are you talking about?
Don't you understand?
I'm it!
It's, it's in me.
- The accident?
- They're coming for me, Chris.
We have to destroy this thing before they get here.
- No.
You can't go back in there, Chester.
Police!
I'm placing you under arrest, Dr. Banton.
A lot of people will die if you do this.
Step against the wall, sir!
I'm begging you.
I don't want to hurt you.
I said step against the wall, now!
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
Chester!
No matter what they say to you later, you're doing the right thing.
Lock it up, Chris.
- All right.
Let's get the accelerator on line.
I'm afraid not, Chester.
You can do it, Chris.
I can, but I'm not.
No.
Chris, tell me you're not working for them.
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!
Careful.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
I'll die before I let them use me!
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.
Chris, don't do this.
Listen to me!
This is wrong.
You're making a terrible mistake.
- Yes?
Is he there?
- I've got him.
He's not going anywhere until you pick him up.
Hello?
Dr. Davey?
- Chris!
Chris.
Chris!
What's happening?
Chris!
Chris.
We're not the first ones here, Mulder.
That's Detective Ryan's car.
I was afraid of this.
Mulder.
Damn it.
What's that noise?
It's the accelerator.
Mulder!
Scully, look at this.
He must have killed her and then killed himself.
- No, he couldn't have.
- What?
This chamber's been sealed from the outside.
By who?
Agent Mulder.
- I thought you had agreed not to contact me again about this.
- You lied to me.
- About?
- About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was, and you used me to lead you to him.
You were the one who contacted me, Agent Mulder.
I won't be your stalking horse, or the government's.
You seem to be mistaken about the amount of control you exercise over this arrangement.
You killed Dr. Banton!
- Have you lost your mind?
- A nurse at the hospital identified you.
Ayoung detective is dead because of you.
Who do you answer to?
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor,
I've never made you any promises.
All right.
Promise me something right now.
Promise me this will be our last meeting.
We're finished.
You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder.
Mulder.
I didn't kill him.
The mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.
How you doing?
I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.
She was my student, and she came to me for help.
I know it must be hard.
This shouldn't have happened.
This never should have happened.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond P.D.
- Doing what?
- A missing person report... was filed this morning by a Dr. Morris West.
He's a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.
- I'm not sure I follow you.
- The missing person was Dr. Christopher Davey.
He hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.
Do they have any leads or know where he might be?
- No.
None.
- But you do.
I've been wondering.
What if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?
Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?
Dr. Davey would have been helpful to us.
We'll be studying this man for a long time.
Morris?
Morris, I need to talk to you!
Morris, it's me.
Are you in there?
Morris?
Morris, if you're in there, open the damn door!
Morris!
Morris, open up!
Morris, I need to talk to you!
Gail Anne is dead.
It was my fault.
Morris!
Morris, I need to talk to you.
Come to the door, Morris, please.
Answer the door, dammit!
Oh, no!
No.
Oh, God, no!
No, God!
God, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Please, no.
Please!
X-Files Season 2 Episode 23
- Soft Light
Two apparent abductions in a month, then this one.
My contact says the Richmond PD's hit a brick wall, so I said we'd have a look.
- Who's your contact?
- Kelly Ryan.
She was one of my students at the academy.
She's been bumped up to detective and she's nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.
- Hi.
This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
- Heard a lot about you.
We'll talk later.
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, aged 52.
He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco, up here for a meeting.
- He arrived by train.
- How do you know he's missing?
He set a wake-up call for 6am.
The operator tried, but got no answer.
Mm.
Scotch.
It looks like he barely touched it.
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
After three hours, they sent hotel security up.
The door was locked, security chain fastened.
And when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.
- Windows?
- Locked from the inside.
We're six storeys up, no fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.
- Agent Scully, what are you lookin' at?
- Uh, the heat register.
- You think anyone could squeeze in there?
- You never know.
- You guys turn up any forensics evidence?
- Uh, just this.
- Scully, look at this.
- What is it?
We don't know.
The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr Newirth checked in.
There were similar burn marks at the previous crime scenes.
- Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
- No.
His wife says he loathed cigarettes.
- Yet he worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?
Yes, sir.
Mostly carbon, with some potassium and trace minerals.
- Could be residue from burnt human flesh.
- Does this look like an arm to anybody?
- An arm?
- What are you thinkin', Mulder?
This burn mark is right where I'd stand to answer the door, right?
- Yes.
- And I'd only look out the peephole if there was something to look at, right?
- That makes sense.
- Could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
- Of course.
And can you run those against Mr Newirth's?
Do you have his prints?
From his toiletries and check-in slip.
Check them against all hotel employees and guests.
- Anything else?
- What's the name of the last missing person?
That would be Margaret Wysnecki.
Thanks.
This should do it.
Is this your first case, Detective?
- Yes, sir.
- Any idea why they gave it to you?
No one else wanted it.
Because of the lack of evidence, this is still a missing persons case not likely to end up on the front pages.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Can I ask what you think may have happened?
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.
You're doing just fine.
- Having a little fun?
- What do you mean?
- Spontaneous human combustion?
- I have case files of bodies reduced to ash with no attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.
Let's forget that there's no scientific theory to support it.
OK.
Hey, Scully.
Can you spare a prophylactic?
What are the odds of that, huh?
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.
Check this out.
My newest tool in the fight against crime.
$49.95 at your local hardware store.
Neat trick.
For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt.
- Look at this, Mulder.
- Hm.
What do we know about the victim?
Margaret Wysnecki, aged 66.
Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco, where she worked for 36 years.
Tobacco?
Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco.
Half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks.
- Could be just a coincidence.
- Yeah, probably.
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, worked for Polarity Magnetics Inc.
They didn't find any prints.
Why should the prints on the bulb mean anything?
I don't know.
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.
M Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia.
Return train dated March 17th.
- The day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came by train.
And Gail Anne Lambert...
Uh, no.
Nothing here puts her near the train station.
- Maybe that detail was overlooked.
- What's the significance?
Maybe these people are being hunted, and the hunter's working the train station.
What about spontaneous human combustion?
Maybe it's not spontaneous.
Call your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.
Suspicious male in the alley behind the station.
I'm gonna check him out.
Roger that, 64.
I'm on my way.
Sir, could I speak with you?
Hold on!
I only wanna ask you a couple of questions!
All right, stop right there.
Don't move.
Just hold it.
Put your hands in the air, sir.
Stay... away from me.
What do you think you're doin'?
Come on outta there.
We just wanna talk to you.
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna hurt you.
- Move it.
- Hands where we can see them.
Please...
I'm warning you.
- I'm a dangerous man.
- Keep movin', pal, out where we can see ya.
All right.
I want you to lie face down on the ground.
Don't... come any closer.
Get down on the ground, sir.
Now!
Please!
You don't understand.
- Oh, God!
No!
- Barney?
Don't!
No!
Stay away!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Not again!
No!
No!
No!
No!
- What happened here, Kelly?
- I sent two patrolmen down here.
They lost radio contact with them just after midnight.
- All they found was two more scorch marks.
- Nothing else?
No.
Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.
- You were just doing your job.
- They wanna know why I sent these men.
- If I tell them I've involved you, they'll snap.
- Those prints?
I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests then through the national databases.
No match.
- Some first case, huh?
- Make sure you hang on to this case.
I'm sure something will turn up.
- These ideas of yours.
Care to share them?
- Not yet.
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully.
I was right about that.
- So where does this leave us?
- Maybe with enough to identify the killer.
- How?
- He was here last night.
He was also probably here on March 17th and March 31st.
The days that the other two people disappeared.
That leaves us with three days of station video tapes to check and hopefully find out who this guy is.
- That's assuming we're looking for a guy.
Either way, the security camera's our only witness.
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.
Or none of them.
We've gone through the entire week and I'm still not sure how to find him.
That's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck.
- Let's go back to the terminal tape.
- Again?
He's gotta be on at least one tape.
Chances are he's not carrying a sign with an arrow on it.
There you go.
See this guy, right here?
He's always here.
What's he doing?
- Looking at the floor.
- Why's he doin' that?
Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.
- Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
- Sure.
OK.
Can you reframe and blow it up some more?
See, he's got something on his jacket.
Let's see if I can pull it up.
- Polarity Magnetics.
- That's where the first victim worked.
Looks like it's been closed up.
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.
We're looking for a man who may have worked here.
- When was this taken?
- March 22nd.
Do you know him?
Sure I know him.
Dr Chester Banton.
- He was my business partner.
- You mean he's not any more?
I don't know.
I would assume not.
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.
- I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
- How's that?
Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.
Polarity Magnetics does, or did, primarily two kinds of research.
Mostly we designed maglev applications - people movers, bullet trains.
But, for Chester, that just paid the bills for the theoretical stuff he was interested in.
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter.
Quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks.
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.
- The very building blocks of reality.
- Except no one knows if they exist.
Chester was sure they did.
So sure, he bet his life on it.
This is where it happened.
Chester was working to isolate a new particle.
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.
One fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart.
- Powered by what?
- A couple of billion megawatts.
- Virginia Power loved us.
- Exactly what happened here?
The work involved bombarding beta particles with an alpha target negative against positive.
Chester had started the countdown when he realised he'd made a mistake.
Something needed readjusting in the target room.
Except you can't stop the countdown once you've begun.
There was time to safely make the change but I had left the room for a minute when Chester decided to go in.
I didn't realise until it was too late that the door had locked behind him.
Look at this.
As far as I can tell, it burned Chester's shadow right into the wall.
- How did he survive?
- All I can figure is the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass.
- They slid right through his body.
- Like getting an X-ray.
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.
When I saw on the monitor what was happening that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked.
I cut the power, but it was too late.
I remember looking, and... seeing Chester.
He was perfectly calm almost like he wanted it to happen.
Like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorised in some kind of physical way.
As if the truth might come into him.
Excuse me.
What do you think, Scully?
Well, this looks like the same kind of material found at the other crime scenes.
Maybe it is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.
I'm less convinced of that now.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr Chester Banton.
Maybe even part of him.
Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.
I know of only one place to start lookin'.
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.
- What are you looking at?
- On the tape, he kept staring at the floor.
I'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.
Maybe the exposure affected his mind.
Nonsensical repetitive behaviour is common in mental illness.
You trying to tell me something?
I called Detective Ryan.
She's having the prints on the bulbs checked against Banton's.
Did you tell her about his accident?
No.
I only told her he was a possible suspect, and that it was too early to get her hopes up.
And that we have more questions than answers.
- Like?
- Like a motive.
Like a murder weapon.
- Like...
- What if Dr Banton...
Look here.
There are hardly any shadows cast.
- What do you mean?
- The lighting in here is diffused.
Soft light.
What if that's what Dr Banton was looking for?
Looking for his shadow?
Dr Banton.
Stop right there!
Dr Banton!
Please... just leave me alone.
We're federal agents, Dr Banton.
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.
Stay away from me.
Wait!
It'll kill you.
It doesn't care who you are.
Oh, thank God!
- I thought he was to be kept in the dark.
- He insisted on soft light.
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.
How can you even... begin to understand what it's like?
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.
Living like a bum.
Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.
The accident in the lab, the quantum bombardment.
You believe that altered you physically?
You could...
You could say that.
Can you tell us how?
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.
- But it has something to do with dark matter.
- It has everything to do with dark matter.
My shadow isn't mine.
It's...
It's like a black hole.
It splits molecules into component atoms.
It unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.
- That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
- It wasn't me.
Gail Anne was my colleague.
She...
The night after the accident, I went to see her.
I was just standing in the doorway.
I was...
I was looking right at her.
And then she was gone.
You have no control over it?
If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people?
All I can do is study it.
Try and divine its...
its true nature before they do.
They?
The government.
They're after me.
And when they find me they're going to do the brain suck they've just been dying to do.
"Brain suck"?
For the purpose of?
For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish.
And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.
But if they killed you, wouldn't your shadow just...
Disappear?
Who knows?
That's why you have to get me out of here.
If I die... there could be nothing left to tether this thing.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to ask you to discontinue interrogating the suspect.
This is Detective Barron, the primary on this case.
- I was wondering what your involvement is.
- We caught the guy.
I appreciate that.
But no one seems to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.
Agent Mulder and I are here in an unofficial capacity.
Then who brought you in?
We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.
Banton's prints place him at two of the crime scenes.
And Transit Authority tapes show him in the vicinity of two of the most recent victims.
- I'd say this case is pretty much explained.
- Really?
Have you talked to Dr Banton?
Don't try to interrogate me, Agent Mulder.
I'm not the suspect.
You know nothing about this case, so you stuck it with Detective Ryan.
- Let her decide how to proceed.
- She is handling this case.
She's done well.
I see no reason not to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred.
Transferred?
Where?
To the city jail, for his arraignment.
I don't think you appreciate the danger that he poses.
I don't think you have the authority to tell me or anyone else in my unit how to do our job.
I think we can handle it from here, Agent Mulder.
We'll call you if there's anything more you can do.
Come on, Mulder.
Let's go.
Soft light.
He needs soft light.
I hope you know what you're doing, putting Detective Ryan's ambition over good sense.
Ambition?
She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club.
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- You never put yourself ahead of your work.
And that's what's happening here.
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction here.
We were called in as a favour.
And we just handed the A-bomb to the Boy Scouts.
I'm sure precautions will be taken.
I'm sure Robert Oppenheimer heard that from the same government Dr Banton is afraid of.
You believe this paranoia about brain sucking?
That man is scared, and not just of his own shadow.
As brilliant as Dr Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional.
- He shows almost every textbook indicator.
- We've both seen the physical evidence.
Look, I don't know how to explain it.
But that's not our job.
I don't know what else we should do.
I think I do.
All you've given me is a name.
Chester Ray Banton.
- Dr Chester Ray Banton.
Do you know him?
- No.
Should I?
He's being held by the police in connection with several bizarre murders.
He's a physicist, researching quarks, gluons...
Dark matter.
- He thinks the government is out to get him.
- It's tax season.
So do most Americans.
- He believes his life is in danger.
- Is he a dangerous man?
Yes.
Yes.
- Where is he being held?
- Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital.
- But not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- Why?
- Last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.
Yes, I know.
And you can trust them as you trust me, I promise.
Dead men can't keep promises.
The next time, the blood and regret could be yours.
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.
I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you.
Promise you won't contact me again unless absolutely necessary.
I promise.
Frank, are your lights on?
Ours just went...
Hi.
We're here to transfer Chester Ray Banton.
I have orders he's being transferred tomorrow.
Due to the power outage, there's been a change of plans.
No one's supposed to go in there!
Here.
Quickly.
Who are you?
No.
Don't do this.
Please, no.
No, don't.
Leave me alone.
- What did you find out, Scully?
- Richmond PD had two officers outside.
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- The nurse said there were three men.
Three?
The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks away.
Somebody posing as a city engineer.
Somebody who knew how to take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.
Somebody from the government coming for Dr Banton?
Being paranoid doesn't mean he's wrong.
But my guess is they failed, and Dr Banton's on the loose.
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her.
She was in charge of his transfer and arraignment.
She's in some pretty hot water.
Maybe that was an appointment he wasn't meant to keep.
Let's go.
- Where?
Mulder, wait.
Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr Banton said last night.
- He said a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head.
He hasn't killed himself only because he's afraid of releasing the dark matter.
That's just a theory, and a pretty wild one at that.
Whether or not Dr Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.
And so does whoever tried to take him last night.
All he's tried to do is control this thing.
He'll go to the one place where he thinks he can do that.
And we gotta get there first.
Don't turn on the light, Chris, unless you wanna die.
Chester, what the hell is going on?
The FBI are looking for you.
Where have you been?
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.
- What's this about?
Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris.
It's real.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand?
I'm it.
- It's...
It's in me.
- The accident?
They're coming for me.
We have to destroy this thing before they get here.
No!
You can't go back in there!
Police!
I'm placing you under arrest, Dr Banton.
- A lot of people will die if you do this.
- Step against the wall, sir.
I'm begging you.
I don't wanna hurt you.
I said step against the wall.
Now!
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
- Chester!
- No matter what they say to you later you're doing the right thing.
Lock it up, Chris.
All right.
Let's get the accelerator on line.
I'm afraid not, Chester.
- You can do it, Chris.
- I can.
But I'm not.
No!
Chris, tell me you're not working for them.
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!
- Careful.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'll die before I'll let them use me!
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.
Chris, don't do this.
Listen to me!
This is wrong!
You're making a terrible mistake!
I've got him.
He's not goin' anywhere till you pick him up.
Chris!
Chris?
Chris!
What's happening?
Chris!
Chris...
- Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.
- I was afraid of this.
Mulder.
Dammit.
What's that noise?
It's the accelerator.
Mulder!
Scully, look at this.
He must have killed her and then killed himself.
He couldn't have.
This chamber's been sealed from the outside.
By who?
Agent Mulder.
I thought you agreed not to contact me again about this.
- You lied to me.
- About?
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was.
- And you used me to lead you to him.
- You contacted me, Agent Mulder.
I won't be your stalking-horse, or the government's.
You seem to be mistaken about how much control you exercise over this arrangement.
You killed Dr Banton!
- Have you lost your mind?
- The nurse identified you.
A young detective is dead because of you.
Who do you answer to?
!
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor I've never made you any promises.
All right.
Promise me somethin' right now.
Promise me this'll be our last meeting.
We're finished.
You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder.
Mulder!
I didn't kill him.
The mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.
- How are you doin'?
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.
She was my student, and she came to me for help.
- I know it must be hard.
- This shouldn't have happened.
This never should have happened.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.
- Doing what?
- A missing-person report was filed by a Dr Morris West, a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.
I'm not sure I follow you.
Dr Christopher Davey hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.
- Do they have any leads?
- No.
None.
But you do?
What if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?
Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?
Dr Davey would have been helpful to us.
We'll be studying this man for a long time.
Morris?
Morris, I need to talk to you!
Morris, it's me.
Are you in there?
Morris?
Morris, if you're in there, open the damn door!
Morris!
Morris, open up!
Morris, I need to talk to you!
Gail Anne is dead.
It was my fault.
Morris!
Morris, I need to talk to you.
Come to the door, Morris, please.
Answer the door, dammit!
Oh, no!
No.
Oh, God, no!
No, God!
God, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Please, no.
Please!
X-Files Season 2 Episode 23
- Soft Light
Two apparent abductions in a month, then this one.
My contact says the Richmond PD's hit a brick wall, so I said we'd have a look.
- Who's your contact?
- Kelly Ryan.
She was one of my students at the academy.
She's been bumped up to detective and she's nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.
- Hi.
This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
- Heard a lot about you.
We'll talk later.
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, aged 52.
He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco, up here for a meeting.
- He arrived by train.
- How do you know he's missing?
He set a wake-up call for 6am.
The operator tried, but got no answer.
Mm.
Scotch.
It looks like he barely touched it.
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
After three hours, they sent hotel security up.
The door was locked, security chain fastened.
And when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.
- Windows?
- Locked from the inside.
We're six storeys up, no fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.
- Agent Scully, what are you lookin' at?
- Uh, the heat register.
- You think anyone could squeeze in there?
- You never know.
- You guys turn up any forensics evidence?
- Uh, just this.
- Scully, look at this.
- What is it?
We don't know.
The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr Newirth checked in.
There were similar burn marks at the previous crime scenes.
- Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
- No.
His wife says he loathed cigarettes.
- Yet he worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?
Yes, sir.
Mostly carbon, with some potassium and trace minerals.
- Could be residue from burnt human flesh.
- Does this look like an arm to anybody?
- An arm?
- What are you thinkin', Mulder?
This burn mark is right where I'd stand to answer the door, right?
- Yes.
- And I'd only look out the peephole if there was something to look at, right?
- That makes sense.
- Could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
- Of course.
And can you run those against Mr Newirth's?
Do you have his prints?
From his toiletries and check-in slip.
Check them against all hotel employees and guests.
- Anything else?
- What's the name of the last missing person?
That would be Margaret Wysnecki.
Thanks.
This should do it.
Is this your first case, Detective?
- Yes, sir.
- Any idea why they gave it to you?
No one else wanted it.
Because of the lack of evidence, this is still a missing persons case not likely to end up on the front pages.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Can I ask what you think may have happened?
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.
You're doing just fine.
- Having a little fun?
- What do you mean?
- Spontaneous human combustion?
- I have case files of bodies reduced to ash with no attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.
Let's forget that there's no scientific theory to support it.
OK.
Hey, Scully.
Can you spare a prophylactic?
What are the odds of that, huh?
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.
Check this out.
My newest tool in the fight against crime.
$49.95 at your local hardware store.
Neat trick.
For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt.
- Look at this, Mulder.
- Hm.
What do we know about the victim?
Margaret Wysnecki, aged 66.
Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco, where she worked for 36 years.
Tobacco?
Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco.
Half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks.
- Could be just a coincidence.
- Yeah, probably.
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, worked for Polarity Magnetics Inc.
They didn't find any prints.
Why should the prints on the bulb mean anything?
I don't know.
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.
M Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia.
Return train dated March 17th.
- The day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came by train.
And Gail Anne Lambert...
Uh, no.
Nothing here puts her near the train station.
- Maybe that detail was overlooked.
- What's the significance?
Maybe these people are being hunted, and the hunter's working the train station.
What about spontaneous human combustion?
Maybe it's not spontaneous.
Call your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.
Suspicious male in the alley behind the station.
I'm gonna check him out.
Roger that, 64.
I'm on my way.
Sir, could I speak with you?
Hold on!
I only wanna ask you a couple of questions!
All right, stop right there.
Don't move.
Just hold it.
Put your hands in the air, sir.
Stay... away from me.
What do you think you're doin'?
Come on outta there.
We just wanna talk to you.
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna hurt you.
- Move it.
- Hands where we can see them.
Please...
I'm warning you.
- I'm a dangerous man.
- Keep movin', pal, out where we can see ya.
All right.
I want you to lie face down on the ground.
Don't... come any closer.
Get down on the ground, sir.
Now!
Please!
You don't understand.
- Oh, God!
No!
- Barney?
Don't!
No!
Stay away!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Not again!
No!
No!
No!
No!
- What happened here, Kelly?
- I sent two patrolmen down here.
They lost radio contact with them just after midnight.
- All they found was two more scorch marks.
- Nothing else?
No.
Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.
- You were just doing your job.
- They wanna know why I sent these men.
- If I tell them I've involved you, they'll snap.
- Those prints?
I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests then through the national databases.
No match.
- Some first case, huh?
- Make sure you hang on to this case.
I'm sure something will turn up.
- These ideas of yours.
Care to share them?
- Not yet.
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully.
I was right about that.
- So where does this leave us?
- Maybe with enough to identify the killer.
- How?
- He was here last night.
He was also probably here on March 17th and March 31st.
The days that the other two people disappeared.
That leaves us with three days of station video tapes to check and hopefully find out who this guy is.
- That's assuming we're looking for a guy.
Either way, the security camera's our only witness.
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.
Or none of them.
We've gone through the entire week and I'm still not sure how to find him.
That's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck.
- Let's go back to the terminal tape.
- Again?
He's gotta be on at least one tape.
Chances are he's not carrying a sign with an arrow on it.
There you go.
See this guy, right here?
He's always here.
What's he doing?
- Looking at the floor.
- Why's he doin' that?
Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.
- Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
- Sure.
OK.
Can you reframe and blow it up some more?
See, he's got something on his jacket.
Let's see if I can pull it up.
- Polarity Magnetics.
- That's where the first victim worked.
Looks like it's been closed up.
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.
We're looking for a man who may have worked here.
- When was this taken?
- March 22nd.
Do you know him?
Sure I know him.
Dr Chester Banton.
- He was my business partner.
- You mean he's not any more?
I don't know.
I would assume not.
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.
- I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
- How's that?
Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.
Polarity Magnetics does, or did, primarily two kinds of research.
Mostly we designed maglev applications - people movers, bullet trains.
But, for Chester, that just paid the bills for the theoretical stuff he was interested in.
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter.
Quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks.
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.
- The very building blocks of reality.
- Except no one knows if they exist.
Chester was sure they did.
So sure, he bet his life on it.
This is where it happened.
Chester was working to isolate a new particle.
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.
One fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart.
- Powered by what?
- A couple of billion megawatts.
- Virginia Power loved us.

- How did he survive?
- All I can figure is the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass.

- Like getting an X-ray.
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.
When I saw on the monitor what was happening that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked.
I cut the power, but it was too late.
I remember looking, and... seeing Chester.
He was perfectly calm almost like he wanted it to happen.
Like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorised in some kind of physical way.
As if the truth might come into him.
Excuse me.
What do you think, Scully?
Well, this looks like the same kind of material found at the other crime scenes.
Maybe it is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.
I'm less convinced of that now.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

Maybe even part of him.
Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.

There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.
- What are you looking at?
- On the tape, he kept staring at the floor.
I'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.
Maybe the exposure affected his mind.
Nonsensical repetitive behaviour is common in mental illness.
You trying to tell me something?
I called Detective Ryan.
She's having the prints on the bulbs checked against Banton's.
Did you tell her about his accident?
No.
I only told her he was a possible suspect, and that it was too early to get her hopes up.
And that we have more questions than answers.
- Like?
- Like a motive.
Like a murder weapon.
- Like...
- What if Dr Banton...
Look here.
There are hardly any shadows cast.
- What do you mean?
- The lighting in here is diffused.
Soft light.
What if that's what Dr Banton was looking for?
Looking for his shadow?
Dr Banton.
Stop right there!
Dr Banton!
Please... just leave me alone.
We're federal agents, Dr Banton.
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.
Stay away from me.
Wait!
It'll kill you.
It doesn't care who you are.
Oh, thank God!
- I thought he was to be kept in the dark.
- He insisted on soft light.
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.
How can you even... begin to understand what it's like?
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.
Living like a bum.
Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.
The accident in the lab, the quantum bombardment.
You believe that altered you physically?
You could...
You could say that.
Can you tell us how?
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.
- But it has something to do with dark matter.
- It has everything to do with dark matter.
My shadow isn't mine.
It's...
It's like a black hole.
It splits molecules into component atoms.
It unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.
- That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
- It wasn't me.
Gail Anne was my colleague.
She...
The night after the accident, I went to see her.
I was just standing in the doorway.
I was...
I was looking right at her.
And then she was gone.
You have no control over it?
If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people?
All I can do is study it.
Try and divine its...
its true nature before they do.
They?
The government.
They're after me.
And when they find me they're going to do the brain suck they've just been dying to do.
"Brain suck"?
For the purpose of?
For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish.
And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.
But if they killed you, wouldn't your shadow just...
Disappear?
Who knows?
That's why you have to get me out of here.
If I die... there could be nothing left to tether this thing.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to ask you to discontinue interrogating the suspect.
This is Detective Barron, the primary on this case.
- I was wondering what your involvement is.
- We caught the guy.
I appreciate that.
But no one seems to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.
Agent Mulder and I are here in an unofficial capacity.
Then who brought you in?
We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.
Banton's prints place him at two of the crime scenes.
And Transit Authority tapes show him in the vicinity of two of the most recent victims.
- I'd say this case is pretty much explained.
- Really?
Have you talked to Dr Banton?
Don't try to interrogate me, Agent Mulder.
I'm not the suspect.
You know nothing about this case, so you stuck it with Detective Ryan.
- Let her decide how to proceed.
- She is handling this case.
She's done well.
I see no reason not to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred.
Transferred?
Where?
To the city jail, for his arraignment.
I don't think you appreciate the danger that he poses.
I don't think you have the authority to tell me or anyone else in my unit how to do our job.
I think we can handle it from here, Agent Mulder.
We'll call you if there's anything more you can do.
Come on, Mulder.
Let's go.
Soft light.
He needs soft light.
I hope you know what you're doing, putting Detective Ryan's ambition over good sense.
Ambition?
She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club.
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- You never put yourself ahead of your work.
And that's what's happening here.
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction here.
We were called in as a favour.
And we just handed the A-bomb to the Boy Scouts.
I'm sure precautions will be taken.
I'm sure Robert Oppenheimer heard that from the same government Dr Banton is afraid of.
You believe this paranoia about brain sucking?
That man is scared, and not just of his own shadow.
As brilliant as Dr Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional.
- He shows almost every textbook indicator.
- We've both seen the physical evidence.
Look, I don't know how to explain it.
But that's not our job.
I don't know what else we should do.
I think I do.
All you've given me is a name.
Chester Ray Banton.
- Dr Chester Ray Banton.
Do you know him?
- No.
Should I?
He's being held by the police in connection with several bizarre murders.
He's a physicist, researching quarks, gluons...
Dark matter.
- He thinks the government is out to get him.
- It's tax season.
So do most Americans.
- He believes his life is in danger.
- Is he a dangerous man?
Yes.
Yes.
- Where is he being held?
- Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital.
- But not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- Why?
- Last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.
Yes, I know.
And you can trust them as you trust me, I promise.
Dead men can't keep promises.
The next time, the blood and regret could be yours.
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.
I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you.
Promise you won't contact me again unless absolutely necessary.
I promise.
Frank, are your lights on?
Ours just went...
Hi.
We're here to transfer Chester Ray Banton.
I have orders he's being transferred tomorrow.
Due to the power outage, there's been a change of plans.
No one's supposed to go in there!
Here.
Quickly.
Who are you?
No.
Don't do this.
Please, no.
No, don't.
Leave me alone.
- What did you find out, Scully?
- Richmond PD had two officers outside.
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- The nurse said there were three men.
Three?
The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks away.
Somebody posing as a city engineer.
Somebody who knew how to take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.
Somebody from the government coming for Dr Banton?
Being paranoid doesn't mean he's wrong.
But my guess is they failed, and Dr Banton's on the loose.
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her.
She was in charge of his transfer and arraignment.
She's in some pretty hot water.
Maybe that was an appointment he wasn't meant to keep.
Let's go.
- Where?
Mulder, wait.
Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr Banton said last night.
- He said a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head.
He hasn't killed himself only because he's afraid of releasing the dark matter.
That's just a theory, and a pretty wild one at that.
Whether or not Dr Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.
And so does whoever tried to take him last night.
All he's tried to do is control this thing.
He'll go to the one place where he thinks he can do that.
And we gotta get there first.
Don't turn on the light, Chris, unless you wanna die.
Chester, what the hell is going on?
The FBI are looking for you.
Where have you been?
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.
- What's this about?
Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris.
It's real.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand?
I'm it.
- It's...
It's in me.
- The accident?
They're coming for me.
We have to destroy this thing before they get here.
No!
You can't go back in there!
Police!
I'm placing you under arrest, Dr Banton.
- A lot of people will die if you do this.
- Step against the wall, sir.
I'm begging you.
I don't wanna hurt you.
I said step against the wall.
Now!
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
- Chester!
- No matter what they say to you later you're doing the right thing.
Lock it up, Chris.
All right.
Let's get the accelerator on line.
I'm afraid not, Chester.
- You can do it, Chris.
- I can.
But I'm not.
No!
Chris, tell me you're not working for them.
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!
- Careful.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'll die before I'll let them use me!
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.
Chris, don't do this.
Listen to me!
This is wrong!
You're making a terrible mistake!
I've got him.
He's not goin' anywhere till you pick him up.
Chris!
Chris?
Chris!
What's happening?
Chris!
Chris...
- Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.
- I was afraid of this.
Mulder.
Dammit.
What's that noise?
It's the accelerator.
Mulder!
Scully, look at this.
He must have killed her and then killed himself.
He couldn't have.
This chamber's been sealed from the outside.
By who?
Agent Mulder.
I thought you agreed not to contact me again about this.
- You lied to me.
- About?
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was.
- And you used me to lead you to him.
- You contacted me, Agent Mulder.
I won't be your stalking-horse, or the government's.
You seem to be mistaken about how much control you exercise over this arrangement.
You killed Dr Banton!
- Have you lost your mind?
- The nurse identified you.
A young detective is dead because of you.
Who do you answer to?
!
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor I've never made you any promises.
All right.
Promise me somethin' right now.
Promise me this'll be our last meeting.
We're finished.
You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder.
Mulder!
I didn't kill him.
The mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.
- How are you doin'?
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.
She was my student, and she came to me for help.
- I know it must be hard.
- This shouldn't have happened.
This never should have happened.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.
- Doing what?
- A missing-person report was filed by a Dr Morris West, a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.
I'm not sure I follow you.
Dr Christopher Davey hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.
- Do they have any leads?
- No.
None.
But you do?
What if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?
Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?
Dr Davey would have been helpful to us.
We'll be studying this man for a long time.

Morris, I need to talk to you!
Morris, it's me.
Are you in there?

Morris, open up!
Morris, I need to talk to you!
Gail Anne is dead.
It was my fault.

Two apparent abductions in a month, then this one.
My contact says the Richmond PD's hit a brick wall, so I said we'd have a look.
- Who's your contact?
- Kelly Ryan.
She was one of my students at the academy.
She's been bumped up to detective and she's nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.
- Hi.
This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
- Heard a lot about you.
We'll talk later.
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, aged 52.
He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco, up here for a meeting.
- He arrived by train.
- How do you know he's missing?
He set a wake-up call for 6am.
The operator tried, but got no answer.
Mm.
Scotch.
It looks like he barely touched it.
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
After three hours, they sent hotel security up.
The door was locked, security chain fastened.
And when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.
- Windows?
- Locked from the inside.
We're six storeys up, no fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.
- Agent Scully, what are you lookin' at?
- Uh, the heat register.
- You think anyone could squeeze in there?
- You never know.
- You guys turn up any forensics evidence?
- Uh, just this.
- Scully, look at this.
- What is it?
We don't know.
The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr Newirth checked in.
There were similar burn marks at the previous crime scenes.
- Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
- No.
His wife says he loathed cigarettes.
- Yet he worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?
Yes, sir.
Mostly carbon, with some potassium and trace minerals.
- Could be residue from burnt human flesh.
- Does this look like an arm to anybody?
- An arm?
- What are you thinkin', Mulder?
This burn mark is right where I'd stand to answer the door, right?
- Yes.
- And I'd only look out the peephole if there was something to look at, right?
- That makes sense.
- Could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
- Of course.
And can you run those against Mr Newirth's?
Do you have his prints?
From his toiletries and check-in slip.
Check them against all hotel employees and guests.
- Anything else?
- What's the name of the last missing person?
That would be Margaret Wysnecki.
Thanks.
This should do it.
Is this your first case, Detective?
- Yes, sir.
- Any idea why they gave it to you?
No one else wanted it.
Because of the lack of evidence, this is still a missing persons case not likely to end up on the front pages.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Can I ask what you think may have happened?
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.
You're doing just fine.
- Having a little fun?
- What do you mean?
- Spontaneous human combustion?
- I have case files of bodies reduced to ash with no attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.
Let's forget that there's no scientific theory to support it.
OK.
Hey, Scully.
Can you spare a prophylactic?
What are the odds of that, huh?
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.
Check this out.
My newest tool in the fight against crime.
$49.95 at your local hardware store.
Neat trick.
For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt.
- Look at this, Mulder.
- Hm.
What do we know about the victim?
Margaret Wysnecki, aged 66.
Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco, where she worked for 36 years.
Tobacco?
Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco.
Half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks.
- Could be just a coincidence.
- Yeah, probably.
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, worked for Polarity Magnetics Inc.
They didn't find any prints.
Why should the prints on the bulb mean anything?
I don't know.
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.
M Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia.
Return train dated March 17th.
- The day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came by train.
And Gail Anne Lambert...
Uh, no.
Nothing here puts her near the train station.
- Maybe that detail was overlooked.
- What's the significance?
Maybe these people are being hunted, and the hunter's working the train station.
What about spontaneous human combustion?
Maybe it's not spontaneous.
Call your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.
Suspicious male in the alley behind the station.
I'm gonna check him out.
Roger that, 64.
I'm on my way.
Sir, could I speak with you?
Hold on!
I only wanna ask you a couple of questions!
All right, stop right there.
Don't move.
Just hold it.
Put your hands in the air, sir.
Stay... away from me.
What do you think you're doin'?
Come on outta there.
We just wanna talk to you.
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna hurt you.
- Move it.
- Hands where we can see them.
Please...
I'm warning you.
- I'm a dangerous man.
- Keep movin', pal, out where we can see ya.
All right.
I want you to lie face down on the ground.
Don't... come any closer.
Get down on the ground, sir.
Now!
Please!
You don't understand.
- Oh, God!
No!
- Barney?
Don't!
No!
Stay away!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Not again!
No!
No!
No!
No!
- What happened here, Kelly?
- I sent two patrolmen down here.
They lost radio contact with them just after midnight.
- All they found was two more scorch marks.
- Nothing else?
No.
Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.
- You were just doing your job.
- They wanna know why I sent these men.
- If I tell them I've involved you, they'll snap.
- Those prints?
I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests then through the national databases.
No match.
- Some first case, huh?
- Make sure you hang on to this case.
I'm sure something will turn up.
- These ideas of yours.
Care to share them?
- Not yet.
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully.
I was right about that.
- So where does this leave us?
- Maybe with enough to identify the killer.
- How?
- He was here last night.
He was also probably here on March 17th and March 31st.
The days that the other two people disappeared.
That leaves us with three days of station video tapes to check and hopefully find out who this guy is.
- That's assuming we're looking for a guy.
Either way, the security camera's our only witness.
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.
Or none of them.
We've gone through the entire week and I'm still not sure how to find him.
That's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck.
- Let's go back to the terminal tape.
- Again?
He's gotta be on at least one tape.
Chances are he's not carrying a sign with an arrow on it.
There you go.
See this guy, right here?
He's always here.
What's he doing?
- Looking at the floor.
- Why's he doin' that?
Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.
- Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
- Sure.
OK.
Can you reframe and blow it up some more?
See, he's got something on his jacket.
Let's see if I can pull it up.
- Polarity Magnetics.
- That's where the first victim worked.
Looks like it's been closed up.
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.
We're looking for a man who may have worked here.
- When was this taken?
- March 22nd.
Do you know him?
Sure I know him.
Dr Chester Banton.
- He was my business partner.
- You mean he's not any more?
I don't know.
I would assume not.
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.
- I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
- How's that?
Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.
Polarity Magnetics does, or did, primarily two kinds of research.
Mostly we designed maglev applications - people movers, bullet trains.
But, for Chester, that just paid the bills for the theoretical stuff he was interested in.
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter.
Quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks.
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.
- The very building blocks of reality.
- Except no one knows if they exist.
Chester was sure they did.
So sure, he bet his life on it.
This is where it happened.
Chester was working to isolate a new particle.
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.
One fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart.
- Powered by what?
- A couple of billion megawatts.
- Virginia Power loved us.
- Exactly what happened here?
The work involved bombarding beta particles with an alpha target negative against positive.
Chester had started the countdown when he realised he'd made a mistake.
Something needed readjusting in the target room.
Except you can't stop the countdown once you've begun.
There was time to safely make the change but I had left the room for a minute when Chester decided to go in.
I didn't realise until it was too late that the door had locked behind him.
Look at this.
As far as I can tell, it burned Chester's shadow right into the wall.
- How did he survive?
- All I can figure is the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass.
- They slid right through his body.
- Like getting an X-ray.
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.
When I saw on the monitor what was happening that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked.
I cut the power, but it was too late.
I remember looking, and... seeing Chester.
He was perfectly calm almost like he wanted it to happen.
Like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorised in some kind of physical way.
As if the truth might come into him.
Excuse me.
What do you think, Scully?
Well, this looks like the same kind of material found at the other crime scenes.
Maybe it is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.
I'm less convinced of that now.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr Chester Banton.
Maybe even part of him.
Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.
I know of only one place to start lookin'.
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.
- What are you looking at?
- On the tape, he kept staring at the floor.
I'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.
Maybe the exposure affected his mind.
Nonsensical repetitive behaviour is common in mental illness.
You trying to tell me something?
I called Detective Ryan.
She's having the prints on the bulbs checked against Banton's.
Did you tell her about his accident?
No.
I only told her he was a possible suspect, and that it was too early to get her hopes up.
And that we have more questions than answers.
- Like?
- Like a motive.
Like a murder weapon.
- Like...
- What if Dr Banton...
Look here.
There are hardly any shadows cast.
- What do you mean?
- The lighting in here is diffused.
Soft light.
What if that's what Dr Banton was looking for?
Looking for his shadow?
Dr Banton.
Stop right there!
Dr Banton!
Please... just leave me alone.
We're federal agents, Dr Banton.
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.
Stay away from me.
Wait!
It'll kill you.
It doesn't care who you are.
Oh, thank God!
- I thought he was to be kept in the dark.
- He insisted on soft light.
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.
How can you even... begin to understand what it's like?
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.
Living like a bum.
Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.
The accident in the lab, the quantum bombardment.
You believe that altered you physically?
You could...
You could say that.
Can you tell us how?
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.
- But it has something to do with dark matter.
- It has everything to do with dark matter.
My shadow isn't mine.
It's...
It's like a black hole.
It splits molecules into component atoms.
It unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.
- That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
- It wasn't me.
Gail Anne was my colleague.
She...
The night after the accident, I went to see her.
I was just standing in the doorway.
I was...
I was looking right at her.
And then she was gone.
You have no control over it?
If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people?
All I can do is study it.
Try and divine its...
its true nature before they do.
They?
The government.
They're after me.
And when they find me they're going to do the brain suck they've just been dying to do.
"Brain suck"?
For the purpose of?
For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish.
And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.
But if they killed you, wouldn't your shadow just...
Disappear?
Who knows?
That's why you have to get me out of here.
If I die... there could be nothing left to tether this thing.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to ask you to discontinue interrogating the suspect.
This is Detective Barron, the primary on this case.
- I was wondering what your involvement is.
- We caught the guy.
I appreciate that.
But no one seems to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.

Come on, Mulder.
Let's go.
Soft light.
He needs soft light.
I hope you know what you're doing, putting Detective Ryan's ambition over good sense.
Ambition?
She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club.
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- You never put yourself ahead of your work.
And that's what's happening here.
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction here.

Yes.
Yes.

- Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital.
- But not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- Why?
- Last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.
Yes, I know.
And you can trust them as you trust me, I promise.
Dead men can't keep promises.

I have orders he's being transferred tomorrow.
Due to the power outage, there's been a change of plans.
No one's supposed to go in there!
Here.
Quickly.
Who are you?
No.
Don't do this.
Please, no.
No, don't.

- What did you find out, Scully?
- Richmond PD had two officers outside.
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- The nurse said there were three men.
Three?
The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks away.
Somebody posing as a city engineer.
Somebody who knew how to take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.
Somebody from the government coming for Dr Banton?
Being paranoid doesn't mean he's wrong.
But my guess is they failed, and Dr Banton's on the loose.
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her.
She was in charge of his transfer and arraignment.
She's in some pretty hot water.
Maybe that was an appointment he wasn't meant to keep.
Let's go.
- Where?
Mulder, wait.
Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr Banton said last night.
- He said a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head.
He hasn't killed himself only because he's afraid of releasing the dark matter.
That's just a theory, and a pretty wild one at that.
Whether or not Dr Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.
And so does whoever tried to take him last night.
All he's tried to do is control this thing.
He'll go to the one place where he thinks he can do that.
And we gotta get there first.
Don't turn on the light, Chris, unless you wanna die.
Chester, what the hell is going on?
The FBI are looking for you.
Where have you been?
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.
- What's this about?
Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris.
It's real.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand?
I'm it.
- It's...
It's in me.
- The accident?
They're coming for me.
We have to destroy this thing before they get here.
No!
You can't go back in there!
Police!
I'm placing you under arrest, Dr Banton.
- A lot of people will die if you do this.
- Step against the wall, sir.
I'm begging you.
I don't wanna hurt you.
I said step against the wall.
Now!
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
- Chester!
- No matter what they say to you later you're doing the right thing.
Lock it up, Chris.
All right.
Let's get the accelerator on line.
I'm afraid not, Chester.
- You can do it, Chris.
- I can.
But I'm not.
No!
Chris, tell me you're not working for them.
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!
- Careful.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'll die before I'll let them use me!
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.
Chris, don't do this.
Listen to me!
This is wrong!
You're making a terrible mistake!
I've got him.
He's not goin' anywhere till you pick him up.
Chris!
Chris?
Chris!
What's happening?
Chris!
Chris...
- Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.
- I was afraid of this.
Mulder.
Dammit.
What's that noise?
It's the accelerator.
Mulder!
Scully, look at this.
He must have killed her and then killed himself.
He couldn't have.
This chamber's been sealed from the outside.
By who?
Agent Mulder.
I thought you agreed not to contact me again about this.
- You lied to me.
- About?
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was.
- And you used me to lead you to him.
- You contacted me, Agent Mulder.
I won't be your stalking-horse, or the government's.
You seem to be mistaken about how much control you exercise over this arrangement.
You killed Dr Banton!
- Have you lost your mind?
- The nurse identified you.
A young detective is dead because of you.
Who do you answer to?
!
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor I've never made you any promises.
All right.
Promise me somethin' right now.
Promise me this'll be our last meeting.
We're finished.
You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder.
Mulder!
I didn't kill him.
The mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.
- How are you doin'?
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.
She was my student, and she came to me for help.
- I know it must be hard.
- This shouldn't have happened.
This never should have happened.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.
- Doing what?
- A missing-person report was filed by a Dr Morris West, a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.
I'm not sure I follow you.
Dr Christopher Davey hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.
- Do they have any leads?
- No.
None.
But you do?
What if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?
Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?
Dr Davey would have been helpful to us.
We'll be studying this man for a long time.

Two apparent abductions in less than a month, and then this one last night.
According to my contact, the Richmond PD has hit a brick wall, so I told her we'd come down and have a look.
Who's your contact?
Her name's Kelly Ryan.
She was one of my students when I was teaching at the academy.
She's just been bumped up to detective, and she's a little nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.
Kelly.
Agent Scully.
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
Heard a lot about you.
We'll talk later.
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, age 52.
He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco up from Raleigh-Durham for a meeting.
He arrived on an evening train.
How do you know he's missing?
He set a wake-up call for 6:00 a.m. this morning.
When the operator tried to place it, there was no answer.
Mmm.
Scotch.
It looks like he barely touched it.
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
They waited three hours before sending hotel security up.
The door was locked, security chain fastened, and when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.
Windows?
Locked from the inside.
We're six stories up-- no fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.
Agent Scully, what are you looking at?
Uh, the heat register.
You don't think anyone could've squeezed in there.
You never know.
You guys turn up any forensics evidence at all?
Just this.
Scully, look at this.
- What is it?
- We don't know.
The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr. Newirth checked in.
And there were similar burn marks at each of the previous crime scenes.
Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
No.
According to his wife, he loathed cigarettes.
That's strange for a man who worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?
- Yes, sir.
It's mostly carbon, with some potassium and trace minerals.
Well, could be residue from burned human flesh.
This look like an arm to anybody?
An arm?
What are you thinking, Mulder?
This burn mark-- it's right where I'd be if I was standing here answering the door, right?
- Yes.
- And I wouldn't be looking out the peephole unless there was something to look at, would I?
That makes sense.
Detective Ryan, could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
Of course.
And can you run those against Mr. Newirth's?
Do you have Mr. Newirth's prints?
We got them from his toiletries and check-in slip.
Okay, can you check those against all hotel employees and registered guests?
Anything else?
Yeah, do you have the name of the last missing person?
Uh... that would be Margaret Wysnecki.
Thanks.
This should do it.
Is this your first case, Detective?
Yes, sir.
Any idea why they gave it to you?
No one else wanted it.
Because of the lack of evidence, this is still officially a missing persons case.
Not likely to end up on the front page of the daily paper.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Can I ask what you think may have happened?
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.
You're doing just fine.
Having a little fun?
What are you talking about?
Spontaneous human combustion?
I have over a dozen case files.
A human body is reduced to ash without any attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.
Let's just forget for the moment that's there's no scientific theory to support it.
Okay.
Hey, Scully, can you spare a prophylactic?
Thanks.
What are the odds of that, huh?
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.
Check this out.
My newest tool in the fight against crime.
$49.95 at your local hardware store.
Neat trick.
For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt.
Look at this, Mulder.
Hmm.
What do we know about the victim?
Margaret Wysnecki, age 66.
Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco, where she worked production line for 36 years.
Tobacco.
Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco, didn't he?
Yeah, but half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks-- could be just a coincidence.
Yeah, you're probably right.
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, was an engineer for Polarity Magnetics, Inc.
They didn't find any prints in here or anywhere else in the house.
What makes you think the prints on the bulb mean anything?
I don't know.
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.
M. Wysnecki, round-trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia.
Return train dated March 17.
That's the same day she disappeared.
Patrick Newirth came into town by train, didn't he?
And Gail Anne Lambert...
Uh, no, it doesn't say anything here that puts her anywhere near the Richmond train station.
Maybe that was a detail that was overlooked.
Well, even so, what's the significance?
Maybe these people aren't just disappearing, maybe they're being hunted, and the hunter's working the train station.
And whatever happened to spontaneous human combustion?
Maybe it's not so spontaneous.
Get on the phone to your young detective, and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.
56, this is 64.
Suspicious male loitering in the alley behind the train station.
I'm going to check him out.
Roger that, 64.
I'm on my way.
Sir, can I speak with you?
Hold on!
I only want to ask you a couple of questions!
All right, stop right there.
Don't move.
Just hold it.
Put your hands in the air, sir.
Stay away from me.
What do you think you're doing?
All right, come on out of there.
We just want to talk to you.
Stay away from me!
I don't want to hurt you.
Move it!
Hands where we can see them.
Please, I'm warning you.
I'm a dangerous man.
Keep moving, pal.
Out where we can see you.
All right, I want you to lie face down on the ground.
Don't come any closer.
Get down on the ground, sir.
Now!
Please.
You don't understand.
Oh, God, no!
Barney?
Don't!
No!
Stay away!
Oh, God.
No, no.
Oh, God, not again!
Oh, God!
Oh, no!
No!
What happened here, Kelly?
I sent two patrolmen down here last night like you told me.
They lost radio contact with them just after midnight.
All they found this morning was two more scorch marks on the pavement.
Nothing else?
No.
Suddenly, this looks like it could be a cop-killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.
Well, you were just doing your job.
Yeah, well, they want to know on what suspicions I sent these men down here.
If I tell them I've involved the FBI, they're going to snap.
The prints you pulled from that lightbulb...
I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests, then through the national databases.
No match.
Some first case, huh?
You just make sure you hang on to this case.
I'm sure something will turn up.
These ideas of yours, Mulder, you care to share them?
Not yet.
You don't have a clue, do you?
He was here, Scully;
I was right about that.
All right, where does this leave us?
Maybe with enough to identify the killer.
How?
He was here last night.
He was also probably here on March 17 and 31.
Those are the dates that Margaret Wysnecki and Patrick Newirth disappeared.
That leaves us with three days of train station videotapes to cross-reference and hopefully find out who this guy is.
That's assuming we're looking for a guy.
Either way, the security camera's our only witness.
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.
Or none of them.
We've gone through the entire week, and I'm still not sure how you expect to find him.
That's it for March 22 on the arrival deck.
Okay, let's go back to the terminal tape.
Again?
He's got to be on at least one of these tapes.
Chances are, he's not walking around carrying a sign with an arrow on it.
There you go.
See, this guy right here-- he's always here.
What's he doing?
Looking at the floor.
Why's he doing that?
Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.
Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
Sure.
Okay, can you reframe and blow it up some more?
He's got something on his jacket right there.
I'll see if I can pull it up.
Polarity Magnetics.
That's where the first victim worked.
Looks like it's been closed up.
Yes?
We're Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.
We're looking for a man who may have worked here.
When was this taken?
March 22.
Do you know him?
Sure, I know him.
Dr. Chester Banton.
He was my business partner.
You mean he's not anymore?
I don't know.
I would assume not.
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.
I wondered if he wasn't going to turn up dead.
How's that?
Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.
Polarity Magnetics does-- or did-- primarily two kinds of research.
Mostly, we were designing mag-lev applications-- people movers, bullet trains-- but for Chester, that was just a way to pay the bills for the really theoretical stuff he was interested in.
Which was what?
Researching dark matter.
Quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks.
Subatomic particles.
The mysteries of the universe.
Theoretically, the very building blocks of reality.
Except no one knows if they truly exist.
Chester was sure they did.
So sure, he bet his life on it.
This is where it happened.
Chester was working to isolate a new particle.
He'd been working on it for a year.
This is a particle accelerator.
One-fifth the power of the Texas supercollider in a space the size of a Walmart.
Powered by what?
Couple billion megawatts.
Virginia Power loved us.
Exactly what happened here?
The work involved the bombardment of beta particles with an alpha target-- negative against positive.
Chester had everything set and had started the countdown when he realized he'd made a mistake.
There was something that needed readjusting in the target room.
Except, you can't stop the countdown once you've begun.
There was time to safely make the change, but I'd left the room for a minute when Chester decided to go in.
I didn't realize until it was too late that the door had locked behind him.
Look at this.
As far as I can tell, it burned Chester's shadow right into the wall.
How did he survive?
All I can figure is, the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass-- that they slid right through his body.
Like getting an X-ray.
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.
When I looked at the monitor and saw what was happening-- that Chester was trapped in here-
- I panicked.
I cut the power, but it was too late.
I remember looking and seeing Chester.
He was perfectly calm.
Almost like he wanted it to happen.
Like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorized in some kind of physical way.
As if the truth might come into him.
Excuse me.
What do you think, Scully?
Well, this looks like the same kind of material that they found at each of the other crime scenes.
Maybe what we're dealing with is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.
I'm less convinced of that now.
What do you think it is?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr. Chester Ray Banton-- maybe even part of him.
Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.
Well, I know of only one place to start looking.
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.
What are you looking at?
In the videotape, Dr. Banton kept staring at the floor, and I'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.
Well, maybe the exposure affected his mind.
Nonsensical, repetitive behavior is a common trait of mental illness.
You trying to tell me something?
I called Detective Ryan.
She's having the prints on the lightbulbs checked against Banton's.
Did you tell her about Dr. Banton's accident?
No, I only told her that he was a possible suspect and that it was a bit too early to get her hopes up.
And that right now, we have more questions than we do answers.
Like?
Like a motive.
Like a murder weapon.
Like...
What if Dr. Banton...?
Look here.
There are hardly any shadows cast.
What do you mean?
The lighting in here is diffused.
It's soft light.
What if that's what Dr. Banton was looking for?
Looking for his shadow?
Dr. Banton.
Stop right there!
Dr. Banton!
Please... just leave me alone.
We're federal agents, Dr. Banton.
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.
Stay away from me.
Wait!
It'll kill you.
It doesn't care who you are.
Oh, thank God.
I thought the orders were to keep this patient in the dark.
He insisted on soft light.
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.
How can you even begin to understand what it's like?
We're trying to understand.
Living in a train station day and night, living like a bum.
Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.
The accident in the lab-- the quanta bombardment-- you believe that altered you physically?
You could...
you could say that.
Can you tell us how?
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.
But it has something to do with dark matter?
It has everything to do with dark matter.
My shadow... isn't mine.
It's... it's like a black hole.
It splits molecules into component atoms.
It unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.
That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
Wasn't me.
Gail Anne was my colleague.
She...
The night after the accident, I went to see her.
I was just standing in the doorway.
I was...
I was looking right at her, and then she was gone.
You have no control over it?
If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people?
All I can do is... study it... try and divine its true nature before they do.
"They"?
The government.
They're after me.
And when they find me, they're going to do the brain suck they've just been dying to do.
"Brain suck."
For the purpose of...?
For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish.
And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.
But if they...
if they killed you, then wouldn't your shadow just...?
Disappear?
Who knows?
That's why you have to get me out of here.
If I die, there could be nothing left to tether this thing.
Excuse me.
I'm going to have to ask you to discontinue your interrogation of the suspect.
This is Detective Barron.
He's the primary on this case.
Yeah, I was just wondering what your involvement is here.
We caught the guy.
I appreciate that.
But no one seems to be able to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.
Agent Mulder and I are here strictly in an unofficial capacity.
Then who brought you in?
We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.
Well, Banton's prints place him at two of the crime scenes, and Transit Authority tapes show him in the immediate vicinity of two of the most recent victims.
So I say this case is looking pretty much explained.
Really?
Have you talked to Dr. Banton?
I hope you're not trying to interrogate me, Agent Mulder, because I'm not the suspect.
I don't think you know anything about this case, which is why you stuck it with Detective Ryan.
And I think you should allow her to decide how to proceed.
Detective Ryan is handling this case.
She's done well, and I see no reason not to continue to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred.
Transferred?
Where?
To the city jail, in preparation for his arraignment.
I don't think you fully appreciate this man's condition or the danger that he poses.
I don't think you have the authority to tell me or anyone else in my unit how to do our job.
I think we can handle it from here, Agent Mulder.
We'll call you if there's anything more you can do.
Come on, Mulder, let's go.
Soft light.
He needs soft light.
Hope you know what you're doing, Scully.
What do you mean?
Putting Detective Ryan's ambition
- ahead of all good sense in this case.
- Ambition?
She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club, Mulder.
Believe me, I know how she feels.
The difference is, you never put yourself ahead of your work.
And that's what's happening here.
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction here.
We were called in as a favor.
And as a favor, we just handed over the A-bomb to the Boy Scouts.
I'm sure all the necessary precautions will be taken.
And I'm sure that Robert Oppenheimer got similar reassurances from his government-- the same government that Dr. Banton is afraid of.
You don't believe all this paranoia about brain sucking, do you?
That man is scared, and it's not just of his own shadow.
Mulder, as brilliant as Dr. Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional.
He demonstrated just about every textbook indicator back there.
We've both seen the physical evidence, Scully.
Look, I don't know how to explain it, but that's not our job.
I don't know what else we should do.
I think I do.
All you've given me is a name-- Chester Ray Banton.
Dr. Chester Ray Banton.
Do you know him?
No.
Should I?
He's being held by the Richmond Police in connection with several bizarre murders.
He's a physicist, researching quarks, gluons-- dark matter.
He believes the government is out to get him.
It's tax season.
So do most Americans.
He believes his life is in danger.
Is he a dangerous man?
Yes.
Where is he being held?
At the Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital, but not for long.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
Why?
The last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.
Yes, I know.
And you can trust them as you trust me.
I promise.
Dead men can't keep promises.
The next time, the blood and regret could be yours.
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.
I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you.
Promise you won't contact me again unless absolutely necessary.
Promise.
Frank, are your lights on down there?
Ours just went...
Hi.
We're here to transfer Chester Ray Banton.
I have orders he's not being transferred until tomorrow.
Due to the power outage, there's been a change of plans.
No one's supposed to go in there!
Here.
Quickly.
Who are you?
No, don't do this.
Please.
Please, no.
No, don't.
Leave me alone.
Mulder.
What did you find out, Scully?
Richmond PD had two officers outside watching the entrance.
They didn't see anybody come in.
According to the floor nurse, there were three men.
Three?
The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks from here.
Somebody posing as a city engineer.
Somebody who would have access to plans for Virginia Power so they could take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.
Somebody from the government coming for Dr. Banton?
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, Scully.
But my guess is he was unsuccessful, and Dr. Banton's on the loose.
That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
Yeah, I just saw her leave.
She was in charge of Dr. Banton's transfer and arraignment this morning.
She's in some pretty hot water.
Well, maybe that was an appointment he was never meant to keep.
- Let's go.
- Where?
Mulder, wait.
Where are we going?
You heard what Dr. Banton said last night.
I heard him say a lot of things.
Put yourself in his head, Scully.
I think the only reason he hasn't tried to kill himself is because he's afraid his death will release the dark matter.
Wait a second.
That's still just a theory, and it's a pretty wild one at that.
Whether or not Dr. Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.
And apparently, so does whoever it is who tried to take him last night.
All that he's been trying to do since the accident is try to control this thing.
And if he escapes, he's going to go to the one place where he thinks he can do that,
We got to get there first.
Don't turn on the light, Chris, unless you want to die.
Chester, what the hell is going on?
The FBI have been looking for you.
Where have you been?
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.
What's this about, Chester?
You're acting crazy.
Talk to me!
We found the dark matter, Chris.
It's real, we found it.
What are you talking about?
Don't you understand?
!
I'm it.
It's... it's in me.
The accident?
They're coming for me, Chris.
We have to destroy this thing before they get here.
No, you can't go back in there, Chester.
Police!
I am placing you under arrest, Dr. Banton.
A lot of people will die if you do this.
Step against the wall, sir.
I'm begging you.
I don't want to hurt you.
I said step against the wall.
Now.
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
Chester!
No matter what they say to you later, you're doing the right thing.
Lock it up, Chris.
All right, let's get the accelerator online.
I'm afraid not, Chester.
You can do it, Chris.
I can, but I'm not.
No, Chris.
Tell me you're not working for them.
Wish I could, Chester.
You son of a bitch!
Careful.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
I'll die before I let them use me!
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.
Chris, don't do this.
Listen to me!
This is wrong!
You're making a terrible mistake.
I've got him.
He's not going anywhere till you pick him up.
Chris!
Chris?
Chris?
!
What's happening?
Chris?
!
Chris?
We're not the first ones here, Mulder.
That's Detective Ryan's car.
I was afraid of this.
Mulder.
Oh, damn it.
What's that noise?
It's the accelerator.
Mulder!
Scully, look at this.
He must have killed her and then killed himself.
He couldn't have.
This chamber's been sealed from the outside.
By who?
Agent Mulder.
I thought you had agreed not to contact me again about this.
You lied to me.
About?
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was, and you used me to lead you to him.
You were the one who contacted me, Agent Mulder.
I won't be your stalking horse, or the government's.
You seem to be mistaken about the amount of control you exercise over this arrangement.
You killed Dr. Banton!
Have you lost your mind?
A nurse at the hospital identified you.
A young detective is dead because of you.
Who do you answer to?
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor,
I've never made you any promises.
All right.
Promise me something right now.
Promise me this will be our last meeting.
We're finished.
You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder.
Mulder?
I didn't kill him.
Mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.
How you doing?
I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.
She was my student, and she came to me for help.
I know it must be hard.
This shouldn't have happened.
This never should have happened.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.
Doing what?
A missing person report was filed this morning by a Dr. Morris West.
He's a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.
I'm not sure I follow you.
The missing person was Dr. Christopher Davey.
He hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.
Do they have any leads or know where he might be?
No, none.
But you do.
I've been wondering, what if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?
Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?
Dr. Davey would have been helpful to us.
We'll be studying this man for a long time.
I made this!
Morris?
Morris, I need to talk to you!
Morris, it's me.
Are you in there?
Morris?
Morris, if you're in there, open the damn door!
Morris!
Morris, open up!
Morris, I need to talk to you!
Gail Anne is dead.
It was my fault.
Morris!
Morris, I need to talk to you.
Come to the door, Morris, please.
Answer the door, dammit!
Oh, no!
No.
Oh, God, no!
No, God!
God, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Please, no.
Please!
X-Files Season 2 Episode 23
- Soft Light
Two apparent abductions in a month, then this one.
My contact says the Richmond PD's hit a brick wall, so I said we'd have a look.
- Who's your contact?
- Kelly Ryan.
She was one of my students at the academy.
She's been bumped up to detective and she's nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.
- Hi.
This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
- Heard a lot about you.
We'll talk later.
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, aged 52.
He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco, up here for a meeting.
- He arrived by train.
- How do you know he's missing?
He set a wake-up call for 6am.
The operator tried, but got no answer.
Mm.
Scotch.
It looks like he barely touched it.
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
After three hours, they sent hotel security up.
The door was locked, security chain fastened.
And when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.
- Windows?
- Locked from the inside.
We're six storeys up, no fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.
- Agent Scully, what are you lookin' at?
- Uh, the heat register.
- You think anyone could squeeze in there?
- You never know.
- You guys turn up any forensics evidence?
- Uh, just this.
- Scully, look at this.
- What is it?
We don't know.
The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr Newirth checked in.
There were similar burn marks at the previous crime scenes.
- Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
- No.
His wife says he loathed cigarettes.
- Yet he worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?
Yes, sir.
Mostly carbon, with some potassium and trace minerals.
- Could be residue from burnt human flesh.
- Does this look like an arm to anybody?
- An arm?
- What are you thinkin', Mulder?
This burn mark is right where I'd stand to answer the door, right?
- Yes.
- And I'd only look out the peephole if there was something to look at, right?
- That makes sense.
- Could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
- Of course.
And can you run those against Mr Newirth's?
Do you have his prints?
From his toiletries and check-in slip.
Check them against all hotel employees and guests.
- Anything else?
- What's the name of the last missing person?
That would be Margaret Wysnecki.
Thanks.
This should do it.
Is this your first case, Detective?
- Yes, sir.
- Any idea why they gave it to you?
No one else wanted it.
Because of the lack of evidence, this is still a missing persons case not likely to end up on the front pages.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Can I ask what you think may have happened?
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.
You're doing just fine.
- Having a little fun?
- What do you mean?
- Spontaneous human combustion?
- I have case files of bodies reduced to ash with no attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.
Let's forget that there's no scientific theory to support it.
OK.
Hey, Scully.
Can you spare a prophylactic?
What are the odds of that, huh?
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.
Check this out.
My newest tool in the fight against crime.
$49.95 at your local hardware store.
Neat trick.
For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt.
- Look at this, Mulder.
- Hm.
What do we know about the victim?
Margaret Wysnecki, aged 66.
Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco, where she worked for 36 years.
Tobacco?
Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco.
Half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks.
- Could be just a coincidence.
- Yeah, probably.
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, worked for Polarity Magnetics Inc.
They didn't find any prints.
Why should the prints on the bulb mean anything?
I don't know.
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.
M Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia.
Return train dated March 17th.
- The day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came by train.
And Gail Anne Lambert...
Uh, no.
Nothing here puts her near the train station.
- Maybe that detail was overlooked.
- What's the significance?
Maybe these people are being hunted, and the hunter's working the train station.
What about spontaneous human combustion?
Maybe it's not spontaneous.
Call your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.
Suspicious male in the alley behind the station.
I'm gonna check him out.
Roger that, 64.
I'm on my way.
Sir, could I speak with you?
Hold on!
I only wanna ask you a couple of questions!
All right, stop right there.
Don't move.
Just hold it.
Put your hands in the air, sir.
Stay... away from me.
What do you think you're doin'?
Come on outta there.
We just wanna talk to you.
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna hurt you.
- Move it.
- Hands where we can see them.
Please...
I'm warning you.
- I'm a dangerous man.
- Keep movin', pal, out where we can see ya.
All right.
I want you to lie face down on the ground.
Don't... come any closer.
Get down on the ground, sir.
Now!
Please!
You don't understand.
- Oh, God!
No!
- Barney?
Don't!
No!
Stay away!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Not again!
No!
No!
No!
No!
- What happened here, Kelly?
- I sent two patrolmen down here.
They lost radio contact with them just after midnight.
- All they found was two more scorch marks.
- Nothing else?
No.
Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.
- You were just doing your job.
- They wanna know why I sent these men.
- If I tell them I've involved you, they'll snap.
- Those prints?
I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests then through the national databases.
No match.
- Some first case, huh?
- Make sure you hang on to this case.
I'm sure something will turn up.
- These ideas of yours.
Care to share them?
- Not yet.
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully.
I was right about that.
- So where does this leave us?
- Maybe with enough to identify the killer.
- How?
- He was here last night.
He was also probably here on March 17th and March 31st.
The days that the other two people disappeared.
That leaves us with three days of station video tapes to check and hopefully find out who this guy is.
- That's assuming we're looking for a guy.
Either way, the security camera's our only witness.
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.
Or none of them.
We've gone through the entire week and I'm still not sure how to find him.
That's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck.
- Let's go back to the terminal tape.
- Again?
He's gotta be on at least one tape.
Chances are he's not carrying a sign with an arrow on it.
There you go.
See this guy, right here?
He's always here.
What's he doing?
- Looking at the floor.
- Why's he doin' that?
Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.
- Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
- Sure.
OK.
Can you reframe and blow it up some more?
See, he's got something on his jacket.
Let's see if I can pull it up.
- Polarity Magnetics.
- That's where the first victim worked.
Looks like it's been closed up.
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.
We're looking for a man who may have worked here.
- When was this taken?
- March 22nd.
Do you know him?
Sure I know him.
Dr Chester Banton.
- He was my business partner.
- You mean he's not any more?
I don't know.
I would assume not.
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.
- I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
- How's that?
Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.
Polarity Magnetics does, or did, primarily two kinds of research.
Mostly we designed maglev applications - people movers, bullet trains.
But, for Chester, that just paid the bills for the theoretical stuff he was interested in.
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter.
Quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks.
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.
- The very building blocks of reality.
- Except no one knows if they exist.
Chester was sure they did.
So sure, he bet his life on it.
This is where it happened.
Chester was working to isolate a new particle.
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.
One fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart.
- Powered by what?
- A couple of billion megawatts.
- Virginia Power loved us.
- Exactly what happened here?
The work involved bombarding beta particles with an alpha target negative against positive.
Chester had started the countdown when he realised he'd made a mistake.
Something needed readjusting in the target room.
Except you can't stop the countdown once you've begun.
There was time to safely make the change but I had left the room for a minute when Chester decided to go in.
I didn't realise until it was too late that the door had locked behind him.
Look at this.
As far as I can tell, it burned Chester's shadow right into the wall.
- How did he survive?
- All I can figure is the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass.
- They slid right through his body.
- Like getting an X-ray.
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.
When I saw on the monitor what was happening that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked.
I cut the power, but it was too late.
I remember looking, and... seeing Chester.
He was perfectly calm almost like he wanted it to happen.
Like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorised in some kind of physical way.
As if the truth might come into him.
Excuse me.
What do you think, Scully?
Well, this looks like the same kind of material found at the other crime scenes.
Maybe it is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.
I'm less convinced of that now.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr Chester Banton.
Maybe even part of him.
Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.
I know of only one place to start lookin'.
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.
- What are you looking at?
- On the tape, he kept staring at the floor.
I'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.
Maybe the exposure affected his mind.
Nonsensical repetitive behaviour is common in mental illness.
You trying to tell me something?
I called Detective Ryan.
She's having the prints on the bulbs checked against Banton's.
Did you tell her about his accident?
No.
I only told her he was a possible suspect, and that it was too early to get her hopes up.
And that we have more questions than answers.
- Like?
- Like a motive.
Like a murder weapon.
- Like...
- What if Dr Banton...
Look here.
There are hardly any shadows cast.
- What do you mean?
- The lighting in here is diffused.
Soft light.
What if that's what Dr Banton was looking for?
Looking for his shadow?
Dr Banton.
Stop right there!
Dr Banton!
Please... just leave me alone.
We're federal agents, Dr Banton.
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.
Stay away from me.
Wait!
It'll kill you.
It doesn't care who you are.
Oh, thank God!
- I thought he was to be kept in the dark.
- He insisted on soft light.
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.
How can you even... begin to understand what it's like?
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.
Living like a bum.
Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.
The accident in the lab, the quantum bombardment.
You believe that altered you physically?
You could...
You could say that.
Can you tell us how?
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.
- But it has something to do with dark matter.
- It has everything to do with dark matter.
My shadow isn't mine.
It's...
It's like a black hole.
It splits molecules into component atoms.
It unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.
- That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
- It wasn't me.
Gail Anne was my colleague.
She...
The night after the accident, I went to see her.
I was just standing in the doorway.
I was...
I was looking right at her.
And then she was gone.
You have no control over it?
If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people?
All I can do is study it.
Try and divine its...
its true nature before they do.
They?
The government.
They're after me.
And when they find me they're going to do the brain suck they've just been dying to do.
"Brain suck"?
For the purpose of?
For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish.
And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.
But if they killed you, wouldn't your shadow just...
Disappear?
Who knows?
That's why you have to get me out of here.
If I die... there could be nothing left to tether this thing.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to ask you to discontinue interrogating the suspect.
This is Detective Barron, the primary on this case.
- I was wondering what your involvement is.
- We caught the guy.
I appreciate that.
But no one seems to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.
Agent Mulder and I are here in an unofficial capacity.
Then who brought you in?
We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.
Banton's prints place him at two of the crime scenes.
And Transit Authority tapes show him in the vicinity of two of the most recent victims.
- I'd say this case is pretty much explained.
- Really?
Have you talked to Dr Banton?
Don't try to interrogate me, Agent Mulder.
I'm not the suspect.
You know nothing about this case, so you stuck it with Detective Ryan.
- Let her decide how to proceed.
- She is handling this case.
She's done well.
I see no reason not to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred.
Transferred?
Where?
To the city jail, for his arraignment.
I don't think you appreciate the danger that he poses.
I don't think you have the authority to tell me or anyone else in my unit how to do our job.
I think we can handle it from here, Agent Mulder.
We'll call you if there's anything more you can do.
Come on, Mulder.
Let's go.
Soft light.
He needs soft light.
I hope you know what you're doing, putting Detective Ryan's ambition over good sense.
Ambition?
She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club.
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- You never put yourself ahead of your work.
And that's what's happening here.
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction here.
We were called in as a favour.
And we just handed the A-bomb to the Boy Scouts.
I'm sure precautions will be taken.
I'm sure Robert Oppenheimer heard that from the same government Dr Banton is afraid of.
You believe this paranoia about brain sucking?
That man is scared, and not just of his own shadow.
As brilliant as Dr Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional.
- He shows almost every textbook indicator.
- We've both seen the physical evidence.
Look, I don't know how to explain it.
But that's not our job.
I don't know what else we should do.
I think I do.
All you've given me is a name.
Chester Ray Banton.
- Dr Chester Ray Banton.
Do you know him?
- No.
Should I?
He's being held by the police in connection with several bizarre murders.
He's a physicist, researching quarks, gluons...
Dark matter.
- He thinks the government is out to get him.
- It's tax season.
So do most Americans.
- He believes his life is in danger.
- Is he a dangerous man?
Yes.
Yes.
- Where is he being held?
- Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital.
- But not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- Why?
- Last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.
Yes, I know.
And you can trust them as you trust me, I promise.
Dead men can't keep promises.
The next time, the blood and regret could be yours.
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.
I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you.
Promise you won't contact me again unless absolutely necessary.
I promise.
Frank, are your lights on?
Ours just went...
Hi.
We're here to transfer Chester Ray Banton.
I have orders he's being transferred tomorrow.
Due to the power outage, there's been a change of plans.
No one's supposed to go in there!
Here.
Quickly.
Who are you?
No.
Don't do this.
Please, no.
No, don't.
Leave me alone.
- What did you find out, Scully?
- Richmond PD had two officers outside.
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- The nurse said there were three men.
Three?
The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks away.
Somebody posing as a city engineer.
Somebody who knew how to take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.
Somebody from the government coming for Dr Banton?
Being paranoid doesn't mean he's wrong.
But my guess is they failed, and Dr Banton's on the loose.
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her.
She was in charge of his transfer and arraignment.
She's in some pretty hot water.
Maybe that was an appointment he wasn't meant to keep.
Let's go.
- Where?
Mulder, wait.
Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr Banton said last night.
- He said a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head.
He hasn't killed himself only because he's afraid of releasing the dark matter.
That's just a theory, and a pretty wild one at that.
Whether or not Dr Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.
And so does whoever tried to take him last night.
All he's tried to do is control this thing.
He'll go to the one place where he thinks he can do that.
And we gotta get there first.
Don't turn on the light, Chris, unless you wanna die.
Chester, what the hell is going on?
The FBI are looking for you.
Where have you been?
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.
- What's this about?
Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris.
It's real.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand?
I'm it.
- It's...
It's in me.
- The accident?
They're coming for me.
We have to destroy this thing before they get here.
No!
You can't go back in there!
Police!
I'm placing you under arrest, Dr Banton.
- A lot of people will die if you do this.
- Step against the wall, sir.
I'm begging you.
I don't wanna hurt you.
I said step against the wall.
Now!
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
- Chester!
- No matter what they say to you later you're doing the right thing.
Lock it up, Chris.
All right.
Let's get the accelerator on line.
I'm afraid not, Chester.
- You can do it, Chris.
- I can.
But I'm not.
No!
Chris, tell me you're not working for them.
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!
- Careful.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'll die before I'll let them use me!
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.
Chris, don't do this.
Listen to me!
This is wrong!
You're making a terrible mistake!
I've got him.
He's not goin' anywhere till you pick him up.
Chris!
Chris?
Chris!
What's happening?
Chris!
Chris...
- Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.
- I was afraid of this.
Mulder.
Dammit.
What's that noise?
It's the accelerator.
Mulder!
Scully, look at this.
He must have killed her and then killed himself.
He couldn't have.
This chamber's been sealed from the outside.
By who?
Agent Mulder.
I thought you agreed not to contact me again about this.
- You lied to me.
- About?
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was.
- And you used me to lead you to him.
- You contacted me, Agent Mulder.
I won't be your stalking-horse, or the government's.
You seem to be mistaken about how much control you exercise over this arrangement.
You killed Dr Banton!
- Have you lost your mind?
- The nurse identified you.
A young detective is dead because of you.
Who do you answer to?
!
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor I've never made you any promises.
All right.
Promise me somethin' right now.
Promise me this'll be our last meeting.
We're finished.
You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder.
Mulder!
I didn't kill him.
The mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.
- How are you doin'?
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.
She was my student, and she came to me for help.
- I know it must be hard.
- This shouldn't have happened.
This never should have happened.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.
- Doing what?
- A missing-person report was filed by a Dr Morris West, a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.
I'm not sure I follow you.
Dr Christopher Davey hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.
- Do they have any leads?
- No.
None.
But you do?
What if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?
Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?
Dr Davey would have been helpful to us.
We'll be studying this man for a long time.

Two apparent abductions in a month, then this one.
My contact says the Richmond PD's hit a brick wall, so I said we'd have a look.
- Who's your contact?
- Kelly Ryan.
She was one of my students at the academy.
She's been bumped up to detective and she's nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.
- Hi.
This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.
- Heard a lot about you.
We'll talk later.
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, aged 52.

- You think anyone could squeeze in there?
- You never know.
- You guys turn up any forensics evidence?
- Uh, just this.
- Scully, look at this.
- What is it?
We don't know.
The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr Newirth checked in.
There were similar burn marks at the previous crime scenes.
- Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
- No.
His wife says he loathed cigarettes.
- Yet he worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?
Yes, sir.
Mostly carbon, with some potassium and trace minerals.
- Could be residue from burnt human flesh.
- Does this look like an arm to anybody?
- An arm?
- What are you thinkin', Mulder?
This burn mark is right where I'd stand to answer the door, right?
- Yes.
- And I'd only look out the peephole if there was something to look at, right?
- That makes sense.

Spontaneous human combustion.

Rapid oxidation without heat.
Let's forget that there's no scientific theory to support it.
OK.

They didn't find any prints.
Why should the prints on the bulb mean anything?
I don't know.
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.
M Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia.
Return train dated March 17th.
- The day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came by train.
And Gail Anne Lambert...
Uh, no.
Nothing here puts her near the train station.
- Maybe that detail was overlooked.
- What's the significance?
Maybe these people are being hunted, and the hunter's working the train station.
What about spontaneous human combustion?
Maybe it's not spontaneous.
Call your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.
Suspicious male in the alley behind the station.
I'm gonna check him out.
Roger that, 64.
I'm on my way.
Sir, could I speak with you?
Hold on!
I only wanna ask you a couple of questions!
All right, stop right there.
Don't move.
Just hold it.
Put your hands in the air, sir.
Stay... away from me.
What do you think you're doin'?
Come on outta there.
We just wanna talk to you.
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna hurt you.
- Move it.
- Hands where we can see them.
Please...
I'm warning you.
- I'm a dangerous man.
- Keep movin', pal, out where we can see ya.
All right.
I want you to lie face down on the ground.
Don't... come any closer.
Get down on the ground, sir.
Now!
Please!
You don't understand.
- Oh, God!
No!
- Barney?
Don't!
No!
Stay away!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Not again!
No!
No!
No!
No!
- What happened here, Kelly?
- I sent two patrolmen down here.
They lost radio contact with them just after midnight.
- All they found was two more scorch marks.
- Nothing else?
No.
Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.
- You were just doing your job.
- They wanna know why I sent these men.
- If I tell them I've involved you, they'll snap.
- Those prints?
I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests then through the national databases.
No match.
- Some first case, huh?
- Make sure you hang on to this case.
I'm sure something will turn up.
- These ideas of yours.
Care to share them?
- Not yet.
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully.
I was right about that.
- So where does this leave us?
- Maybe with enough to identify the killer.
- How?
- He was here last night.
He was also probably here on March 17th and March 31st.
The days that the other two people disappeared.
That leaves us with three days of station video tapes to check and hopefully find out who this guy is.
- That's assuming we're looking for a guy.
Either way, the security camera's our only witness.
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.
Or none of them.
We've gone through the entire week and I'm still not sure how to find him.
That's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck.
- Let's go back to the terminal tape.
- Again?
He's gotta be on at least one tape.
Chances are he's not carrying a sign with an arrow on it.
There you go.
See this guy, right here?
He's always here.
What's he doing?
- Looking at the floor.
- Why's he doin' that?
Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.
- Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
- Sure.
OK.
Can you reframe and blow it up some more?
See, he's got something on his jacket.
Let's see if I can pull it up.
- Polarity Magnetics.
- That's where the first victim worked.
Looks like it's been closed up.
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.
We're looking for a man who may have worked here.
- When was this taken?
- March 22nd.
Do you know him?
Sure I know him.
Dr Chester Banton.
- He was my business partner.
- You mean he's not any more?
I don't know.
I would assume not.
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.
- I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
- How's that?
Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.
Polarity Magnetics does, or did, primarily two kinds of research.
Mostly we designed maglev applications - people movers, bullet trains.
But, for Chester, that just paid the bills for the theoretical stuff he was interested in.
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter.
Quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks.
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.
- The very building blocks of reality.
- Except no one knows if they exist.
Chester was sure they did.
So sure, he bet his life on it.
This is where it happened.
Chester was working to isolate a new particle.
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.
One fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart.
- Powered by what?
- A couple of billion megawatts.
- Virginia Power loved us.
- Exactly what happened here?
The work involved bombarding beta particles with an alpha target negative against positive.
Chester had started the countdown when he realised he'd made a mistake.
Something needed readjusting in the target room.
Except you can't stop the countdown once you've begun.
There was time to safely make the change but I had left the room for a minute when Chester decided to go in.
I didn't realise until it was too late that the door had locked behind him.
Look at this.
As far as I can tell, it burned Chester's shadow right into the wall.
- How did he survive?
- All I can figure is the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass.
- They slid right through his body.
- Like getting an X-ray.
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.
When I saw on the monitor what was happening that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked.
I cut the power, but it was too late.
I remember looking, and... seeing Chester.
He was perfectly calm almost like he wanted it to happen.
Like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorised in some kind of physical way.
As if the truth might come into him.
Excuse me.
What do you think, Scully?
Well, this looks like the same kind of material found at the other crime scenes.
Maybe it is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.
I'm less convinced of that now.
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr Chester Banton.
Maybe even part of him.
Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.
I know of only one place to start lookin'.
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.
- What are you looking at?
- On the tape, he kept staring at the floor.
I'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.
Maybe the exposure affected his mind.
Nonsensical repetitive behaviour is common in mental illness.
You trying to tell me something?
I called Detective Ryan.
She's having the prints on the bulbs checked against Banton's.
Did you tell her about his accident?
No.
I only told her he was a possible suspect, and that it was too early to get her hopes up.
And that we have more questions than answers.
- Like?
- Like a motive.
Like a murder weapon.
- Like...
- What if Dr Banton...
Look here.
There are hardly any shadows cast.
- What do you mean?
- The lighting in here is diffused.
Soft light.
What if that's what Dr Banton was looking for?
Looking for his shadow?
Dr Banton.
Stop right there!
Dr Banton!
Please... just leave me alone.
We're federal agents, Dr Banton.
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.
Stay away from me.
Wait!
It'll kill you.
It doesn't care who you are.
Oh, thank God!
- I thought he was to be kept in the dark.
- He insisted on soft light.
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.
How can you even... begin to understand what it's like?
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.
Living like a bum.
Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.
The accident in the lab, the quantum bombardment.
You believe that altered you physically?
You could...
You could say that.
Can you tell us how?
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.
- But it has something to do with dark matter.
- It has everything to do with dark matter.
My shadow isn't mine.
It's...
It's like a black hole.
It splits molecules into component atoms.
It unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.
- That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
- It wasn't me.
Gail Anne was my colleague.
She...
The night after the accident, I went to see her.
I was just standing in the doorway.
I was...
I was looking right at her.
And then she was gone.
You have no control over it?
If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people?
All I can do is study it.
Try and divine its...
its true nature before they do.
They?
The government.
They're after me.
And when they find me they're going to do the brain suck they've just been dying to do.
"Brain suck"?
For the purpose of?
For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish.
And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.
But if they killed you, wouldn't your shadow just...
Disappear?
Who knows?
That's why you have to get me out of here.
If I die... there could be nothing left to tether this thing.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to ask you to discontinue interrogating the suspect.
This is Detective Barron, the primary on this case.
- I was wondering what your involvement is.
- We caught the guy.
I appreciate that.
But no one seems to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.
Agent Mulder and I are here in an unofficial capacity.
Then who brought you in?
We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.
Banton's prints place him at two of the crime scenes.
And Transit Authority tapes show him in the vicinity of two of the most recent victims.
- I'd say this case is pretty much explained.
- Really?
Have you talked to Dr Banton?
Don't try to interrogate me, Agent Mulder.
I'm not the suspect.
You know nothing about this case, so you stuck it with Detective Ryan.
- Let her decide how to proceed.
- She is handling this case.
She's done well.
I see no reason not to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred.
Transferred?
Where?
To the city jail, for his arraignment.
I don't think you appreciate the danger that he poses.
I don't think you have the authority to tell me or anyone else in my unit how to do our job.
I think we can handle it from here, Agent Mulder.
We'll call you if there's anything more you can do.
Come on, Mulder.
Let's go.
Soft light.
He needs soft light.
I hope you know what you're doing, putting Detective Ryan's ambition over good sense.
Ambition?
She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club.
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- You never put yourself ahead of your work.
And that's what's happening here.
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction here.
We were called in as a favour.
And we just handed the A-bomb to the Boy Scouts.
I'm sure precautions will be taken.
I'm sure Robert Oppenheimer heard that from the same government Dr Banton is afraid of.
You believe this paranoia about brain sucking?
That man is scared, and not just of his own shadow.
As brilliant as Dr Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional.
- He shows almost every textbook indicator.
- We've both seen the physical evidence.
Look, I don't know how to explain it.
But that's not our job.
I don't know what else we should do.
I think I do.
All you've given me is a name.
Chester Ray Banton.
- Dr Chester Ray Banton.
Do you know him?
- No.
Should I?
He's being held by the police in connection with several bizarre murders.
He's a physicist, researching quarks, gluons...
Dark matter.
- He thinks the government is out to get him.
- It's tax season.
So do most Americans.
- He believes his life is in danger.
- Is he a dangerous man?
Yes.
Yes.
- Where is he being held?
- Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital.
- But not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.
- Why?
- Last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.
Yes, I know.
And you can trust them as you trust me, I promise.
Dead men can't keep promises.
The next time, the blood and regret could be yours.
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.
I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you.
Promise you won't contact me again unless absolutely necessary.
I promise.
Frank, are your lights on?
Ours just went...
Hi.
We're here to transfer Chester Ray Banton.
I have orders he's being transferred tomorrow.
Due to the power outage, there's been a change of plans.
No one's supposed to go in there!
Here.
Quickly.
Who are you?
No.
Don't do this.
Please, no.
No, don't.
Leave me alone.
- What did you find out, Scully?
- Richmond PD had two officers outside.
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- The nurse said there were three men.
Three?
The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks away.
Somebody posing as a city engineer.
Somebody who knew how to take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.
Somebody from the government coming for Dr Banton?
Being paranoid doesn't mean he's wrong.
But my guess is they failed, and Dr Banton's on the loose.
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her.
She was in charge of his transfer and arraignment.
She's in some pretty hot water.
Maybe that was an appointment he wasn't meant to keep.
Let's go.
- Where?
Mulder, wait.
Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr Banton said last night.
- He said a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head.
He hasn't killed himself only because he's afraid of releasing the dark matter.
That's just a theory, and a pretty wild one at that.
Whether or not Dr Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.
And so does whoever tried to take him last night.
All he's tried to do is control this thing.
He'll go to the one place where he thinks he can do that.
And we gotta get there first.
Don't turn on the light, Chris, unless you wanna die.
Chester, what the hell is going on?
The FBI are looking for you.
Where have you been?
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.
- What's this about?
Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris.
It's real.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand?
I'm it.
- It's...
It's in me.
- The accident?
They're coming for me.
We have to destroy this thing before they get here.
No!
You can't go back in there!
Police!
I'm placing you under arrest, Dr Banton.
- A lot of people will die if you do this.
- Step against the wall, sir.
I'm begging you.
I don't wanna hurt you.
I said step against the wall.
Now!
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
- Chester!
- No matter what they say to you later you're doing the right thing.
Lock it up, Chris.
All right.
Let's get the accelerator on line.
I'm afraid not, Chester.
- You can do it, Chris.
- I can.
But I'm not.
No!
Chris, tell me you're not working for them.
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!
- Careful.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'll die before I'll let them use me!
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.
Chris, don't do this.
Listen to me!
This is wrong!
You're making a terrible mistake!
I've got him.
He's not goin' anywhere till you pick him up.
Chris!
Chris?
Chris!
What's happening?
Chris!
Chris...
- Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.
- I was afraid of this.
Mulder.
Dammit.
What's that noise?
It's the accelerator.
Mulder!
Scully, look at this.
He must have killed her and then killed himself.
He couldn't have.
This chamber's been sealed from the outside.
By who?
Agent Mulder.
I thought you agreed not to contact me again about this.
- You lied to me.
- About?
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was.
- And you used me to lead you to him.
- You contacted me, Agent Mulder.
I won't be your stalking-horse, or the government's.
You seem to be mistaken about how much control you exercise over this arrangement.
You killed Dr Banton!
- Have you lost your mind?
- The nurse identified you.
A young detective is dead because of you.
Who do you answer to?
!
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor I've never made you any promises.
All right.
Promise me somethin' right now.
Promise me this'll be our last meeting.
We're finished.
You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder.
Mulder!
I didn't kill him.
The mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.
- How are you doin'?
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.
She was my student, and she came to me for help.
- I know it must be hard.
- This shouldn't have happened.
This never should have happened.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.
- Doing what?
- A missing-person report was filed by a Dr Morris West, a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.
I'm not sure I follow you.
Dr Christopher Davey hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.
- Do they have any leads?
- No.
None.
But you do?
What if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?
Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?
Dr Davey would have been helpful to us.
We'll be studying this man for a long time.

Dude, how much longer are you going to play the fool?
I'm telling you, she's a ripe, little melon, just waiting to picking.
Look at her.
Look at her over there, all lonely at that lonely little lemonade stand.
Swagger over there and say, hey, babe!
You, me, Saturday Night?
Prom?
Be there.
- Be square.
Huh?
- Give it a rest.
All right, play it safe then.
Walk over there and say, hi, ah, Sandy, I was wondering if you had a date for the prom?
How hard can that be?
You should talk.
You don't have a date.
Yeah, well, my periscope hasn't settled on a target yet, but it's obvious yours has.
Asking a girl out is something I have to ease into, otherwise I'll scare her off.
Shoot, Stan.
The only one scared is you.
No.
I'm not scared.
I'm cautious.
There's a difference there.
Cautious is for people with weak bladders.
Stan, look at her.
The time is now.
Okay?
You have to claim that property now, before some other sap will.
Maybe tomorrow.
Okay?
No!
There's no more time.
The prom is in three days.
Stan, look, the cards are in your hand.
The Joker is wild.
Bet it all, or fold, baby!
Oh!
Hi.
Can I help you?
Two hot dogs.
Everything on 'em.
Right.
- Hi, Sandy.
- Hi.
- How's hot dog business?
- Oh, great.
Great.
We're not too busy right now though.
Yeah, I know.
Me neither.
Ah, can I get a lemonade?
Sure.
So, are you going to be taking summer school?
No, I'm taking the summer off.
There you go.
Thanks.
How much do I owe you?
Do I owe you a buck?
- It's on the house.
- Thanks.
Maybe I can get a hot dog sometime.
Oh yeah.
Great.
Yeah.
Do you want one right now?
- No.
Ha, ha, no.
Thanks.
- Okay... okay...
So, ah, are, are you going to the--
- Hi.
- One large lemonade.
Lots of ice.
Sandy, prom?
You and me, Saturday Night?
Good deal?
- SANDY:
There you go.
- Oh, God.
Sandy, would you like to go to the prom with me?
- Saturday night?
- Stan.
- What?
- What are you doing?
Um... are you going to be going to the prom by any chance?
- Nope.
- Nope?
That's cool.
I'd love to go.
So, ah, I guess I'll see you around then?
Yeah.
I'll see you at school.
Yeah, school... school.
That's right.
That's right.
We go to school together.
- Well.
Has the eagle landed?
- Oh, yeah.
It sure has.
Cool.
She's really going to the prom with you?
Well, she doesn't have anyone else to go with.
Wow!
TV REPORTER: ...covered six hundred forty-one million gap in this year's budget.
The Los Angeles county board of supervisors set in motion a plan of action
Thursday, that can result in reductions in health services.
Now, back to the studio with Brea Walker.
Mr. Vonn.
Ah, Mr. Vonn.
Please, please sit.
Thank you.
I'm a bit short on time.
I think you'll find last nights news cast very enlightening.
With us now, live, from Ucla, is archaeology professor,
Dr. Rachel Richman.
Dr. Richman?
- Can you hear us?
- Yes, Brea.
I'm...
I'm hear.
Doctor, explain to us the significance of the ancient ring.
The ancinet rings of power were forged of solid gold.
As a pair, these rings have been officially ruled as priceless.
One of the rings has been missing for over eight hundred years.
However, it's counterpart has been on display at the L.A. county art museum since 1963.
Until tonight, that ring was stolen.
WALKER:
Police believe that the theft was a solo operation, which occurred earlier this evening.
No arrests have been made.
You did very well, Mr. Vonn.
I'm very pleased.
Me, too.
Perhaps, you can be of service to me again someday.
Perhaps.
- First, the ring.
- The ring?
Yes, the ring.
Where is it?
You mean, this ring.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's not funny, Mr. Vonn.
Take it off.
Well, I would.
But it doesn't seem to want to come off.
Little bugger seems to be stuck.
Mr. Vonn, take it off your finger... or I'll have someone take your finger off.
I suggest you honor your deal with Mr. Deriva.
Well, I appreciate your concern, Mr. Mosh, but I've altered the deal.
You see, I'm going to keep the ring and take your money.
I don't think so.
I do.
Thank you, Mr. Deriva.
And this story, just in to the CRN news center, a powerful ring has been stolen from Ucla art museum.
Authorities have no leads as to the whereabouts of the ring at this time.
Car 612.
We have a 211 in progress.
Second street tunnel.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- We came for the ring.
Ah, yes, Mr. Mosh.
The ring.
Now, the ring doesn't seem to want you, does it?
Aaaah!
Get him!
Car 612.
I'm going to need back up.
Mr. Mosh, please tell Victor, if he continues to pester me,
I'll send for his soul!
GIRL IN CAR:
The cops in coming.
Have a nice evening, gentlemen.
Hey!
Officer needs assistance at the corner of figueroa and second.
Suspect is heading...
east on second.
He said he'd send the devil for your soul, or something along those lines.
Kid's got a lot of nerve.
First he double-crosses me, and now he treatens me.
That ring's supposed to have powers.
That ring is worth a lot of money, stupid.
He went through five of us like we weren't even there.
- He was wearing the ring.
- Give me a break, Mosh.
Let me tell you what kind of power that ring has... 5.5 million dollars.
That's what I paid Raymond Vonn in advance to steal it.
And that's why he's holding out on me.
It has nothing to do with this hocus-pocus voodoo nonsense.
- It's chinese!
- Yeah, well, whatever it is.
We'll find him again.
We'll find him.
You do that, Mosh.
Shit.
Hey, loser.
Why don't you just shut up?
What's your problem?
Hey, loser...
loser...
Loser, Mom's looking for you.
Where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I called Dr. Maxwell's, but they said the police has already been there.
I know what you're thinking, but you must let me explain.
They don't know what happened.
The police don't.
The doctor's don't.
They weren't there.
I was there.
I know.
Everybody agrees on that, but they won't believe me.
They won't understand.
They won't listen.
They won't let me go to trail.
They think...
I'm crazy.
Do you?
- Yes, Charice, I do.
- No!
No!
No, no, no, no, no!
As God as my witness, I will prove my sanity.
I will prove it to you all!
I'll prove I'm not mad.
[ Begins Sobbing ]
- Too much?
- A little.
It'll be there.
So... did you get a date for the prom yet?
I told you, Mom.
I'm not going to the prom.
Honey, how can you say that?
This is a very special time in your high school career.
Boy, I remember my first prom.
It was one of the highlights of my life.
Now, that's scary.
Look, there's a young girl in my action class.
Her name is Amulet.
She's nice, she's very pretty.
She's a wonderful actress.
She's a virgo.
- You'd be perfect together.
- No.
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to go.
No, because he's afraid to ask someone.
Honey, you don't have go be afraid to ask a girl out.
No, but I'm afraid to ask what that is.
- I wa trying something, huh.
- Ha ha ha.
- Did you taste it?
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
Okay, wise guys.
You can pay for the pizza.
Thank God he delivers.
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm going to bed, sweetie.
I've got an audition in the morning.
- Okay, good luck.
- Thanks.
Stan... promise me you'll ask at least on girl to the prom?
- Mom!
- Please?
Okay, one.
Maybe.
Who are you fooling?
I know you want to go.
- Good night, Mom.
- I'm outta here.
One turn down won't be so bad.
I will have your brother, and we will be complete.
And together we will reign.
We will all reign supreme.
[ Chanting ]
Stan...
Stan...
Stanley Dryer?
Are you awake?
- [ Bell Rings ]
- Okay, saved by the bell.
Class dismissed.
Now, just because it's the last week of school, does not mean you don't have to do your homework.
Everyone read chapter 67 in your text.
You never know when those pop quizzes are coming.
- Stan, can you stay for a moment?
- Busted.
I was going through the test last night when I got to yours.
- Yeah?
- You got an F.
I failed?
Stan, this is your second F this semester.
Now, when this year started, you were a decent A-B student.
Now, I want girls off your mind and poli-sci on it.
We've got a final exam coming up and I want to see Stan, then student, not Stan the romantic.
I'm sorry.
I'll try harder.
As I return there test results to you,
I pose one simple question why do you insist on wasting my time?
We have spent the whole year discussing the history of this nation and I have given my services to your education, and what do I get in return?
C minus...
D...
B minus...
D...
And how many time must I tell you that the war of 1812, was in 1812?
F.
Ha, ha, hello?
This is my favorite time of the year.
We get to throw away all the homework they made us do for a whole year.
I take great pleasure with every single tear.
- What the heck is this?
- I can't believe it.
That's the friday exam which I didn't finish at lunch.
I thought I'd eat it later.
Man, that was like a month ago.
Sick!
You know, I can't believe I shared a locker with you for a whole year.
Hey, that ain't as bad as Leon Crinkle.
He used to put his dirty jockstraps on his locker.
So, did you finally decide where you're going to take Sandy after the prom?
- After?
- Yeah, dork.
What hotel?
- Hotel?
- Hotel!
You've got to get her a hotel room.
You can get a cheap room for...
twenty bucks.
It will impress her.
- Think so?
- Hell, yeah.
I can't believe it.
I love it, man.
My pal, Stan Dryer's getting a hotel room with Sandy Applegate.
Just make sure old Leon doesn't find out about it.
What are you talking about?
I thought she broke up with him?
Yeah... but that doesn't mean he broke up with her though.
There he is.
There he is.
That's the guy who's been hitting on Sandy.
- Where?
- Come on, let's go.
STAN:
You were drunk.
Anything's possible.
Hey!
Guys, lay off here, will you?
I hear you asked my girl to the prom.
- What?
- I don't think you got the point.
Next time, think twice before you ask somebody to prom.
- Leon, what are you doing?
- Get lost, Sandy.
- You betrayed me.
- What?
How could you go to the prom with this loser?
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to prom with him.
- He didn't ask you to prom?
- No.
- You didn't ask her to prom?
- No.
All right, let this be a lesson then.
Nobody asks my girl to prom.
I'm not your girl, Leon.
We broke up, remember?
That's besides the point.
Come on.
You got lucky this time, punk!
- You never asked her out?
- No.
Cowardice knows no boundaries.
You know, it's a good thing I didn't, otherwise he might not have stopped.
Hey, you know, that karate stuff you're taking is really paying off.
All right class, this is a lesson in technique, speed, focus and control.
Now, that's the end of class.
I want everybody to make sure you're ready next week.
We have testing for capa.
Understand?
Let's everybody get up and bow.
Very nice.
Dismissed.
Very, very nice.
Stan, I want to talk to you for a minute.
Come over here.
Stan, you have so much potential, but you're not using what you have.
You lack confidence.
Do you realize how good you could be if you believed in yourself?
And you wouldn't be sporting that black eye, either.
- I have to leave.
- Just think about what I said, Stan.
You know, I'm really tired of driving you around.
- Why don't you just take a bus?
- Six weeks of karate, and you would think that you'd be able to at least lay one punch in.
What are you talking about?
There were five of them.
- That's five to choose from.
- So!
Sinsei is right.
You lack what it takes.
You understimate yourself, so you end up getting your butt kicked like today.
I don't want to hear it.
Tell Mom I'm going to get my own dinner, okay.
- Where are you going?
- The park.
Later, loser.
VONN:
Old man!
You waste such power on a boy.
Your vanity is surpassed only by your ignorance, Mr. Vonn.
Hmm, hmm, hm.
Give me the ring.
You shall not have it.
You will be defeated.
Look out behind you!
Get in!
Come on, get in!
Who are you?
Why is going on here, man?
He's coming after us.
OLD MAN:
Faster, boy.
Stop the car.
I said, stop the car.
Stop the car, boy, now!
Okay, okay.
Just stay calm.
Just remain calm, Stan.
There's a perfectly...
logical... reasons why I'm standing here, on the beach.
Yes!
But it is too simple to understand.
Okay.
I want an explanation, old man.
The best explanation for all things... is time.
What?
Now, what's that supposed to mean?
Okay, okay.
Wake up Stan.
Just wake up.
OLD MAN:
Boy!
Oh, great.
You could of helped, you know.
But, I did.
Look, just please tell me--
There is an answer for every question.
You will learn them only in their... due time.
For now, my body grows tired for the last time.
Give, give me your hand.
Boy!
Please!
Give me your hand.
The ring is not the source of power.
It is... but a doorway to the Power Within you.
Wait!
Hold on!
Just stay with me.
God.
We've got to get you to a doctor.
Open your eyes!
I have been on is Earth for eighty-seven years.
I am ready to leave.
No.
No.
Don't leave me!
Please!
No!
Dude, I'm telling you, man, it's a red wire.
- It's a green wire, man.
- No, it's the red wire.
- Get that lighter down here, dude.
I need some light.
- You're going to burn the dash.
If you touch that...
You're going to get a shock if you touch that wire.
- Ha, ha, ha, haaa.
- Ah!
Shut up, man.
Get that lighter down here.
- [ Others Continue to Laugh ]
- It's the red wire.
Oh, here comes some little kid, man.
Hey, guys.
Mind getting out of my car?
[ Everyone Laughs ] Your car?
[ Belch ] We're sittin' in it.
- Doesn't it make it our car?
- Look...
I'm tired and I've had a long night.
I just want to go home, okay?
He's tired.
It's late.
And he just wants to go home.
[ Laughing Continues ]
We want to go home, too.
So why don't you give us the keys... and we'll go home.
Would you please get out of my car?
He doesn't want to give us the keys, man.
Keys, man!
Come on, get the keys.
He's going to get the keys.
Watch it, man.
He's got a hell of a right.
Come on, man.
Come on, little boy.
[ Belch ]
Oh, is this your car...
Oh, sorry man.
TV:
Only one of you can emerge as a champion.
Pay your respects.
Stanley, do you know what time it is?
Loser, you're missing magic kid.
- Look, I'm sorry I'm late.
Okay?
- Stanley...
I don't have any excuses, I just want to go to sleep.
All right?
is that okay?
Okay.
- Go check out your brother.
- Okay.
Yeah, dip lips.
Where were you?
- Get out of my room.
- What's with the peanut butter?
- Get out!
- I don't think so, cheesehead.
Okay, let go.
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.
- Get out of my room.
- Okay, okay.
Chill.
Foolish old man.
Curse your dead soul.

[ Laughing Grows Louder ]
- Sweetheart... honey, wake up.
- What?
- Are you all right?
- Huh?
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Trying to wake you up.
You're waking up the entire neighbourhood.
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry.
It's all right.
What did you do?
- Meet Freddie Kruger?
- God.
It was so intense.
I was fighting all these ninjas at Culver Bridge.
Hmm.
Ninjas at Culver Bridge.
Wow!
Well, it's only a dream.
You know, after your father died,
- I had nightmares every night.
- Did they stop?
Sure.
As soon as I decided not to let them scare me anymore.
- Easier said, than done.
- You know, sweetheart, we have to choices in life, and we face them everyday.
To be, or not to be.
Hey, I'm serious here.
You either are, or you aren't.
You do, or you don't.
And the world doesn't make those choices for you.
I don't make those choices for you.
Kids at school don't.
The only one who can decide who and what you are, is you.
To be, or not to be, Stan.
That's it.
Hey, how'd that interview go today?
Oh, well, after I signed three autographs, they said no one would accept pig-tailed "Peggy"
as a Raving Lunatic.
Ha, ha, ha.
Who cares what they think,
I know you can be a Raving Lunatic, Mom.
- That's all that matters.
- Thank you.
- Good night, sweet prince.
- Good night, Mom.
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.
- [ Indistinctive Chatter ] - [ Bell Rings ]
Okay, our next set of questions will involve the cold war era, and they would be directed towards...
Stanley Dryer.
Explain what death blow was dealt to the communist party by Gorbachev in 1989.
Um... he ordered that party members could no longer enjoy private privileged access to food and housing, and communism suddenly lost its appeal to card carrying members.
That's good.
Next question.
What kind of tactics were used to gain freedom from the party conservatives?
A political shift towards western style presidency, and a cabinet system of government, utilizing the popularly elected people's congress.
Well, that's right.
Next question.
What was the result of the Sinatra Doctrine?
Well, it replaced the Brezhnev Doctrine, so, it was quite electrifying.
Um... solidarity put gorby to the test by demanding a dominant voice in polish government.
But, with little assistance in sight,
Solidarity won stunning election victories over poland.
Reformers drove out communists, and free elections were set for 1990.
The fresh winds of change have finally arrived.
Any more questions?
- Ha, ha.
- I'm impressed.
I don't know where you got your cheat sheet, but I want a copy.
I have in my possession, the graded results of the final written exam.
And I say to you once more, why do you torment me with your blatant disregard of my educational services?
F...
D...
C...
I feel as if we had accomplished nothing during the past year, except to fix your position as belligerent students, and my position as an old windbag.
A... plus.

[ Bell Rings ]
Sandy, we dated for over four weeks.
I mean that's a month.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Could you hold your voice down, please, Leon.
- People are watching.
- Oh, come on!
Look...
Remember all the good times we had?
Remember how you used to stay after school and watch my football practice?
Remember all the beer parties?
I remember sitting home on friday nights while you went out with rock and gooble.
I remember watching TV all day on weekends with your older brothers, who by the way, are all pigs.
How could you say that?
They all went varsity.
- Everyone of them.
- God.
Man, that sap doesn't know when to give up.
Somebody ought to shove a jockstrap in his mouth.
I think I could do better than that.
What?
It's not going to happen.
I'm tired of it.
- Enough.
- Stan, where are you going?
Stan?
Excuse me one second, guys.
Sandy, would you like to go to the prom with me?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Prom?
You and me?
- You're dead meat, Dryer.
- Oh, but, Leon.
Wait, wait, wait.
Stan doesn't know what he's talking about.
He's... a... suffering delusions, he hasn't been himself lately.
- You got to forgive him.
- I've got one work for you, Graves.
Move your butt, or I'll move it for you.
Isn't that like, eight words to many.
- Leo, no!
- Hey, that's it, Dryer.
It's like a cuisinart thing you did there.
Jockstrap in the mouth is a bit extreme.
Yaaah!
Speed and execution.
That's what it's all about.
I want you to remember, when you're performing breaks, it's dangerous.
Speed and execution is very important.
Excuse me, Sinsei.
Don Wilson is here.
Don.
Don, it's a pleasure to see you again.
It's a pleasure to see you.
Everybody, we have an honored guest today.
Retired Kickboxing Champion, Don "The Dragon Wilson."
I want everybody to get up right now.
Quick.
Courtest bow.
Don "The Dragon Wilson."
Good to see you, Don.
All righty, sit down.
Johnson stay up, Dryer, stay up.
Johnson, I want you to be very, very careful with Dryer, he's only a green belt, you understand?
You're a black belt.
Ready?
Bow here.
Bow to each other.
Ready, set.
Careful, guys.
Easy.
DON:
Sensei, let me speak with Dryer for a minute.
You did great.
Your technique and strategy was right on the money.
You also seem pretty sure of yourself,
- Set.
- all of a sudden,
I have all of this power and confidence.
I mean, you saw me beat up that black belt.
Yes, I did.
But that was the easy part.
What do you mean?
Marital Arts has more to do with mental toughness and more responsibility, than just beating up black belts.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you talking about?
You had a whole career of beating up people.
No, I didn't.
That was kickboxing.
It was just a sport.
I had the utmost respect for my opponments.
It's true, you're good, and someday you might be a champion yourself.
But remember there's a responsibility that comes with your abilities, and it's the proper use of power that's important.
Dude, are you on, like, on steroids, or something?
What?
Well, you kicked Leon's booty in class today, and that's not like you.
Nah, I've just been working out.
That's all.
What was that Einstein stuff in class today, huh?
- I've been studying.
- No, no, no, I don't buy it.
You've been taken over by an alien life form, haven't you?
Yeah, you have.
You can tell me.
It's okay, I'm your buddy.
I was reading about it in the enquirer.
- Excuse me, Stan?
- Sandy, hi, how are you?
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Oh, yeah.
Sure.
What?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I was thinking about what you asked me today,
- you know, about prom.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- And?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Really.
- Oh, that's... that's great!
So, what are you doing right now?
Right now?
I was thinking if you're not doing anything, then maybe we could do something.
Um, actually right now, I'm not doing anything at all.
Ah, Eric, you said that you could handle things alone?
- Alone, me?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Oh!
hey, you two kids go!
Play!
Have a good time.
Yeah, I'll man these dogs myself.
Hot dogs?

It is Stanley, isn't it?
Oh, you can run, but you can't...
Well, you know.
Hey, kid.
Remember me?

You've got something I want, Stanley.
Must we play these games?
Get in!
Get in, if you want to escape.
Hello, Mr. Vonn.
How's it hanging?
Persistent little bugger, aren't you, Mosh?
Actually, Mr. Vonn...
I am.
- STAN:
Who are you?
- Hin-See.
Master Yung was my grandfather.
STAN:
He's the old man who stuck this on my finger.
Why was I being chased?
Where are we going?
HIN-SEE:
Stan!
Very soon, all your questions well be answered.
We're here.
What?
Where are you going?
Where am I?
The house of my grandfather, Master Yung.
Why did he put this ring on my finger?
YUNG:
Surely you can do such a simple task as removing the ring?
Yung!
Yung!
What?
He was just talking to me.
What?
- He said something to me.
- This is Jendo.
He's a chimpanzee.
[ Sighing ] Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Fine.
He hasn't been the same, since my grandfather passed away.
YUNG:
I'm a good boy, but not that good.
You...
You're dead!
No.
I'm alive!
More alive than I have ever been.
No.
I saw you die.
You're dead!
Your fear is your weakness.
- Who are you?
- Master Yung.
Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?
- I see, you do not know either.
- I'm Stan Dryer.
- Very good.
- We're off to a good start.
- Start?
- All right!
Cool!
Yeah!
- CABRELL:
He fought with that man.
That's what the report says.
Lieutenant Cabrell, my son is anything but what you just described.
Well, what I described to you was attested to by a dozen different witnesses.
They all saw Stan fighting with that man.
How can a dozen different witness be wrong?
- Are you saying his mother is wrong?
- No.
I'm saying his mother wasn't there to see it.
He's sixteen, he's never been in a fight.
Believe me!
He's a good boy.
We're off on the wrong foot, here.
That's my fault.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be pointing fingers here,
I just need to settle the facts of this case the best way I can.
And to do that,
- I'm going to need your help.
- Sure.
You mind if I ask you where your husband is?
- I'm a widow.
- Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So it's just you and your two sons?
Uh-huh.
Is there something wrong with that?
No.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Listen, I have my men out looking for Stan right now.
- If anything comes up--
- You'll call me.
I'll call you.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.
I knew it.
I grew up on that show.
Um, so did I.
I had such a crush on "Pig-tailed Peggy,"
back when I was eight years old.
Do you mind if, if I get...
- What?
- Your autograph?
Oh, sure.
I'd say it's for my kids, but I don't have any kids.
I wish you did.
Because then you'd understand, how ridiculous these accusations are.
Mr. Deriva, it won't come off.
Use a knife.
Ah, Raymond!
Welcome to the party.
Mr. Mosh here, is about to take what you owe me.
- And whatever else comes with it.
- I owe you nothing.
I paid you!
I gave you everything you asked for!
And you served your purpose well.
Ha.
You do have an ego, don't you?
I would of played it straight with you, but you're the one who double-crossed me.
Why?
Oh, because you're a fool, Mr. Deriva.
And I would be a fool to follow you, and I can't have that now, can I?
I would rather the boy have the ring, than you.
Boy?
- What boy?
- The boy with the other ring.
Other ring?
I don't have time to explain right now, Mr. Deriva, but, I'd like to make a new deal with you.
[ Chuckling ] Do you think I'm stupid.
No deal!
Cut the finger!
I think you'll like this deal quite simply.
Obey me, or die!
Now, can I have everybody's attention?
[ Groaning ]
Let me repeat my proposition one more time.
Quite simply, obey me, or, I think you remember the rest.
Victor!
Please.
There you go.
I think you'll make a fine example to your boys.
- What do you say?
- Work for me!
Oh, I think you should have taken heed to Mr. Mosh's warnings.
This ring does harbor power.
Power greater than you can imagine, and I wear it on my finger!
YANG:
You're the one chosen to carry the ring.
What do you mean, I was chosen?
You make it sound like the ring makes its own decisions.
It does.
The ring is a vessel, a key to the secrets and strengths each and every man holds within.
It is a doorway to the power of the will.
- It selected you as its bearer.
- Why me then?
It is not for you to question.
It is for you to accept.
Okay.
Okay.
So, I'm going to pass this thing through my family, for let's say, the next eight hundred years?
Only until the ring decides different.
I'm as baffled by its selection as you, but, that is of no matter.
What does matter, is that you were chosen.
Yeah.
I'm the chosen one.
It's time for rest.
Shhh!
Your grandfather's not that great in the explanation department.
My grandfather thinks that the best explanation
- for everything is--
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
Don't tell me.
Time.
Right.
Stan, listen to me.
Long ago... a great emperor longed for strength.
He entered a volcano, and three days later he emerged with two matching rings.
The rings of power.
When he put these two rings on, the emperor became all powerful, but he misused his power, bringing death and misery to his whole village.
And one day, the volcano erupted, destroying the emperor and his whole city.
The only survivors...
were the two rings themselves.
These rings must be split up, and never again worn by the same man.
And as bearer of this ring, it is your responsibility to uphold this commandment.
Vonn is in search of the other ring to abuse its power.
You must make sure he never acquires it.
Because if he does, neither you, nor anyone, will ever be safe again.
Do you understand?
[ Door Bell Ringing ]
- Oh, Lieutenant.
Come in.
- It's, it's Jim.
Remember?
I'm sorry.
Jim, come on in.
No, no.
Actually, I'm just stopping by.

- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

- No.

Don't be afraid.

- You don't have to yell, boy.
- What are you doing, fishing?
Heaven is different for everyone.
For me, it is fishing.
- Last night I had a dream.
- Not a dream, boy, a vision.
What do you think I should do about it?
With the ring...
You will experience power greater than ever imagined!
Understanding it is like a seed.
Nurture it, and it will grow.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
I'm totally late!
I've got to go!
I'm late for a date.
Boy, wait!
The ring brings you many strengths... but you will be strongest, when you use your own true abilities.
Okay, gentlemen.
I'm going to tell you a story of a wicked boy, named Stanley.
Listen closely.
You'll all get to know him very shortly.
- Would you hold still?
- Mom, where's my mascara?
Oh, sweetheart, I don't think you need any more mascara.
You know, where's your ivory broach?
What do you mean I don't need any more mascara?
Well, I think you're wearing enough already.
I mean, any more and you'll need a red nose, and big floppy shoes.
Now, where is your ivory broach?
What do you mean red nose and floppy shoes?
Are you saying I look like a clown?
You know, I have to find that ivory broach.
What ivory broach?
Mom!
Am I wearing too much make-up?
Mom!
What ivory broach?
The ivory broach your older sister wore at her prom.
The ivory broach that I wore to my prom, that ivory broach.
Should I put on some more lipstick, you know,
- to subdue the mascara?
- No.
The ivory broach that my mother gave to me, that her mother gave to her.
It's been in our family for generations!
Oh God!
I can't just cake it on or
I will look like a clown.
I can't believe this!
If I have lost that ivory broach.
- I will never forgive myself.
- [ Door Bell Rings ]
Oh my God!
That's him.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh!
I can't go through with this.
- What are you talking about?
- I look like a clown.
What?
What ever gave you that idea?
You did.
Oh, sweetheart!
I was only kidding.
Sit down.
Look in the mirror.
Huh?
You look like a princess, right out of a fairy tale.
Now, you finish getting dressed.
Huh?
- I'll answer the door.
- Stall him.
Yes!
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Stan Dryer.
- Hi.
Come on in.
- Thanks.
- I'm Gail, Sandy's mother.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
Well, I've heard so much about you.
Sandy's so excited.
Uh, have you been driving long?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Wow.
You look great.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You both look wonderful.
Uh, this is definitely a kodak moment!
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Ah, Stan, maybe a little closer.
Ah... okay.
Ah, no.
Ah, Stan, put your arm around Sandy.
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah.
That's good.
Okay, let's see.

- Thanks.
- You seem different, Stan.
- Is that okay?
Yeah.
I like it.
I mean, not that I didn't like it before, I do.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I just didn't think you'd be interested in me.
[ Door Bell Ringing ]
- Yes?
- Mrs. Applegate?
- Yes.
- I'm Clyda Dryer.
May I come in?
- Please.
- Thank you.
My son Stan...
- goes to school your daughter--
- You're "Pig-tailed Peggy."
Oh my God! "Pig-tailed Peggy." I can't believe it's you.
Yes.
Well, anyway, you see my son--
I have seen a fan of yours since I was six years old.
I wore my hair in pigtails until
I was seventeen, because of you!
- Great!
I'm very flattered.
- Look, the reason I'm here--
Do you remember that show, when you hair got caught in that meat grinder?
And oh--
Mrs. Applegate!
My son is missing.
I found your daughter's name and address
- written down in his room.
- Missing?
- Yes.
- Well, I don't understand.
- He took my daughter to the prom.
- He what?
[ Slow Tempo Music Playing ]
I can't believe I'm actually at the prom and having a good time.
- Why?
- Because, I came with you.
Not that I didn't expect to come to the prom with you and have a good time, but, well, yeah, because I didn't expect to come to the prom with you.
Or to have fun.
I just thought
I would be Leon's arm-piece, you know?
Boring!
- I hope you're not bored with me.
- No.
Are you?
You know what I want.
Have fun!
[ Music Continues Playing ]
[ Music Stops Abruptly ]
Stan, what's going on?
Sandy.
Leave.
I think you have something that belongs to me, kid.
Leave!
Take him!
Stanley, where have you been?
What are these handcuffs doing on you?
Handcuffs, cool!
What are these handcuffs doing on him?
Strong, why don't you take deke, and show him where we keep the cookies around here.
Your son was arrested tonight for the assault on twenty men.
Twenty?
What is this, some kind of joke?
Come on!
Take the cuffs off him.
It's not a joke.
He was just beginning to explain to me, not only how he was able to beat up twenty men, but what he's doing in possession of a stolen ring, that's now stuck on his finger.
Well, Stanley, explain!
The best explanation for all things...
- Is time.
- Well...
- there you go.
- [ Sighs ]
Dr. Rachel Richman, Professor of Archaeology.
Oh yes, of course.
I'm sorry.
Lieutenant Cabrell.
Nice to meet you, and thank you for coming.
- There's the ring.
- Well, couldn't you have at least removed it from his finger?
That's part of the problem.
It isn't coming off.
Doctor, would you excuse us for just a minute, please?
Be gone.
Be gone.
You're of no use to me.
Look, I may have to detain him possibly overnight.
What?
You mean put him in jail?
The ring is stolen property, and it's not coming off of his finger.
- I can't let that leave the station.
- I don't believe this!
Did you try butter?
Would you please hold still, young man?
Oh my heavens!
Oh my God!
- It is your ring, isn't it?
- No, it is not.
What do you mean?
Lieutenant, may I use your telephone?
- What's the matter?
- DR:
RICHMAN:
It's the other ring.
Other ring.
What's going on?
It's the missing twin ring, thought to have been lost for over eight hundred years!
Give me President Hathaway!
VONN:
Stanley!
Dreams do come true.
- Come on, Stanley.
- No!
Stanley, she's scared!
That is not the ring stolen.
It's the stolen ring's counterpart, a twin ring.
When worn with the other, is said to make the wear invincible.
Stanley!
Stanley!
What are you doing?
- Hey!
Stop that kid!
- Stanley!
You come back here right now!
Stay right here!
Hurry get in the car!
- Why would he go crazy like that?
- He was called.
Called?
Called by who?
Called by what?
By the other ring. has your son been suffering nightmares?
Culver Bridge.
Oh God!
Somebody!
Oh God!
SANDY:
Somebody help me please!
Stay here!
Hey kid, so we meet again!
SANDY:
Stan!
Good show, Stanley.
Wonderful!
- How about an encore?
- [ Thugs Hollering ]
SANDY:
Stan!
Very impressive, Stanley.
But, they're not wearing the ring, are they?
I guess it's just you and me.
Wait!
No!
He was to do it himself.
Come here, please.
Yaah!
SANDY:
Stan!
No!
Stay here!
YUNG:
Boy, the rings are not the source of power.
The true power lies within you!
The true power lies within you!
You destroyed them!
You fool!
Stanley!
Don't hurt me, Stanley.
No.
Please, I'm fragile.
Really.
- You lose!
- Yes!
Yes!
I lose.
- I lose, Stanley.
- You're powerless, Vonn!
- Yes!
Yes!
- It is Vonn, isn't it?
Oh, gee!
CLYDA:
Are you okay, Stan?
Thank you!
Thank you!
Stan!
- You saved my life!
- Piece of cake.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Great!
Oh!
Raymond Vonn is wanted in three countries for art theft.
I think we've found our ring theft.
Jim?
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Well, it looks like that about raps it up?
That hardly raps it up.
You've got a lot of explaining to do, mister.
Well, Mom, the best explanation for all things--
Don't even say it!
Come on.
Let's go home.
YUNG:
Boy, the power has always been within you.
You defeated Vonn with your own true abilities.
You have fulfilled the destiny of the rings.
I have come to the end of my journey, but, Stanley, yours...
has just begun.

Well, that's what's brilliant about you, Mr. Feldman.
No one else would have thought of building a residential mini-mall.
Now that I've got everyone else on the block to agree to your offer, I think we're...
It's got to be everyone on the block... everyone... or the deal's off.
Oh, we're headed into the canyon.
I think I'm losing you.
Mr. Feldman.
Cut the crap, Dittmeyer.
Did you get everyone or not?
Well, there's this one family that's holding out.
Then sweeten the deal.
Up the offer.
It's not that simple.
It's like they're not interested in money.
It's like they're not normal.
Why the hell not?
What's their story?

Don't worry about me.
I'm okay.
Morning, Mrs. Brady.
Oh, thanks, Alice.
Morning, Alice.
Careful, Mr. Brady.
Don't bend over.
We've gotten the Dittmeyers' mail again, sweetheart.
You'd think, after all these years they'd know who lives where.
Well, I always know where to deliver my mail.
Mr. Brady...
Mommy, Marcia's been in the bathroom for a super-long time.
Now, Cindy, we've told you before... no one likes a tattletale.
But, Daddy...
Your father's right, sweetheart.
Why don't you help Alice make some cookies?
Okay, Mommy.
But can my doll help, too?
As long as it's not Betsy Wetsy.
She makes my cookies soggy woggy.
Oh, Alice.
Mmm.
4,998...
Come on, Marcia, open up.
I've got to shave.
4,999...
Gosh, Marcia, there are other people in this family besides you.
5,000.
Come on, Marcia.
Doug Simpson's sure to notice me today.
All finished.
Finally.
Greg.
Jan, you're just going to have to wait your turn.
It's never my turn.
Jan, did you move my trophies?
Yes.
I couldn't look in the mirror without seeing the awards of the great Marcia Brady.
I believe these are my white kneesocks.
Not everything in this room is yours.
See, Jan?
I told you they were mine.
Now, put them back, and don't forget to close the drawer when you're done.
She has every right to be mad.
They are her socks.
But why does Marcia get all the socks?
Why does Marcia get all the trophies?
Why does Marcia get all the good drawers?
Yeah.
Why does Marcia get everything?
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.
It's closed!
Come on, Greg.
Hurry up.
Boy, he's worse than Marcia.
Hmm.
Hey, what's wrong with your voice?
Well, my libido is increasing at a rapid rate and the surge of hormones causes dramatic physical and emotional changes.
Well, that's what Miss Lynley told us in health class.
Finally.
Yeah.
Well, you kids have no idea what it takes to impress a chick.
Maybe, someday, when you're older you'll get hip to what it's like being a man.
Good news, Greg.
I'm putting on your favorite Scooby Doo bedsheets.
Scooby Dooby doo!
Honey, I think you've stirred that enough.
I'm not stirring.
I'm looking for Kitty Carryall's underpants.
I tell you what.
Why don't I take over the cookies, and you run these letters to the Dittmeyers and see if they've gotten any of our mail by mistake.
Okay, Mommy.
Missy, get your butt-ugly face down here!
Hello, Eric.
Are your parents home?
Blow off, cheeseball.
Missy!
Shut up before you have a toxic dump.
Hello, Missy.
How's your science project coming?
I finished mine.
What are you going to do?
Hand in your face and call it barf mold?
Thee you on the theethaw, Thindy.
Bye.
Look, Mr. Feldman, I promised they'd sell, and they will.
Like the Bates deal.
Yeah, I know I took it in the rear on that subdivision, but this time,
I'm the one who's doing the screwing.
Yeah, well, just make sure one holdout family doesn't wreck this.
You hear me?
Look, can I call you back?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hello, Mr. Dittmeyer.
Why are you here?
Oh.
Thanks.
Mom asked me to ask you if there's mail for us here by mistake.
I...
I don't understand you.
What do you want?
Mom asked me to ask you if there's any mail for us here by mistake.
What?
Mom asked me to ask you if there's any mail for us here by mistake.
Nope.
Not a clue.
She wants the Bradys' mail, Larry!
Thank you, darling.
So kind of you to climb out from under your hangover.
Let's see.
Where did I file your mail?
Oh, yes.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
How's your daddy?
He's fine.
Mrs. Brady's lucky to have a big, strong, virile man like that.
Tell you what, sweetie.
Next Christmas, you tell you daddy
I'd be more than happy to wrap his package.
Okay.
Here.
Hit the road, bad seed.
Excuse me, but the juice will make your shoes slip.
What?
Your shoes'll slip in the juice.
Oh.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Daddy, Mrs. Dittmeyer said that she'd be glad to wrap your package this Christmas.
Hmm... really?
How is Mrs. Dittmeyer?
Mr. Dittmeyer says she's overhung.
But he's not in a good mood because she's taking it in the rear.
Must be that paperboy again.
Cindy, that's Mr. Dittmeyer's business.
Remember, nobody likes a snitch.
I'm not a snitch.
I just tell it like it is.
You know, Cindy, when you tattle on someone, you're not just telling on them.
You're telling on yourself.
And, by tattling on someone, you're really just telling them,
"I'm a tattletale."
Now, is that the tale you want to tell?
I never thought of it like that.
Sweetheart, it's time to get your school things together, honey.
Okay, Mommy.
Hmm...
What is it, Mike?
It's a letter from the county.
They say we haven't paid our property taxes.
Haven't paid our taxes?
We always pay our taxes.
Well, they say it's the fifth notice and we owe them $20,000 by the end of the week or they'll auction our house.
$20,000?
!
There has to be a mix-up.
Well, we better call someone.
We are?
You do?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I see.
We should?
!
You are?
!
Uh-huh.
All right.
Good-bye.
We owe them.
Oh, Mike.
Well, don't you worry, honey.
We'll find the money.
Find the money?
But we used our savings to go to the Grand Canyon and Hawaii.
What are we going to do, Mike?
Okay, troops... time for school!
Greg!
Marcia!
Peter!
Jan!
Bobby!
Cindy!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Do we always have to walk so close?
Oh, Jan.
Uh...
Mom, can I borrow your car today?
I want to ask Donna Leonard to go out for a soda after school.
All right, but no hot-rodding.
Thanks, Mom.
She's the most far-out chick in my class.
You wouldn't believe how much I dig her.
Sure, I would.
I've been digging Sam so long, by the time he proposes,
I'll be six feet under.
Oh, Alice, what would we do without you?
Probably eat out.
Hey, why the long face, Bobby?
Well, ever since I became a safety monitor at school... nobody will talk to me.
They think I'm some kind of fink.
Bobby, people like to be corrected when they're doing something wrong.
That's how we improve ourselves.
Right, Dad.
And, if your sister would wear her glasses, she just might improve her eyesight.
Marcia doesn't have to wear glasses.
Besides, all my friends at school say glasses make me look positively goofy.
Now, honey, you look very lovely with your glasses on.
Doesn't she, kids?
Far out, Jan. Yeah.
Yeah.
You look great.
Yeah, I mean it.
Outtasight.
All right, troops, off to school.
Good-bye.
Have a good day.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Dad.
Bye, Mom.
Come on, Marcia.
I'm coming.
Jan, a real friend likes you for who you are, not what's on your face.
If you judge your friends for passing judgment on you, you're not only judging yourself you're judging your friends for judging you.
And that would be using bad judgment.
I never thought of it that way.
Jan?
Oh.
Bye.
Bye, honey.
Bye, Bobby.
Bye, Jan.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Stupid little punk kid, stay out of the road!
Davy Jones is the most.
I sure wish he'd write back.
I wrote him over a month ago.
But, Marcia, he gets millions of letters.
But I'm president of his fan club and I invited him to entertain at the school dance.
A big rock star like that can't just drop everything for our dance.
Geez, you can be so silly sometimes.
Everybody out.
This is a carjack.
Well, of course this is a car.
But my name's not Jack...
it's Greg.
And this is my sister Marcia.
Hi.
And you are?
Eddie.
Wait a minute.
Didn't you hear me?
Get out now!
This is a carjacking.
Greg, I think he has a flat tire.
He must need a jack.
Sorry, Eddie.
We don't have a jack.
But don't worry.
I'll call AAA as soon as we get to school.
It was so nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.
Hey, you moron!
Out of the way, jerk!
Now, don't worry about the house, honey.
I'm sure Mr. Phillips will advance me the money.
Oh, of course he will.
You're the best player on his team.
Mmm.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Tiger...
Tiger...
Whatever happened to that dog?
Ha!
Brady.
Morning, Larry.
You know, I was just reading about some beautiful property available up in Utah.
I'll bet you'd feel right at home there.
Blue skies, clean living, Osmonds.
Thanks, Larry, but I'm still not interested in moving.
I love this house.
Carol loves it, the kids love it, Alice loves it.
It was our first house all together.
Half a mil...
take it or leave it.
Like I said, there's nothing that could get us to sell.
I designed this house myself.
It's in perfect condition.
Carol thinks so, the kids think so, Alice thinks so.
Sorry.
Well, you can't blame a guy for trying, huh?
Putz.
Uh... excuse me, Mr. Dittmeyer... but, as a member of the safety patrol,
I must warn you that your hedge is overgrown and can block the view of the street for oncoming traffic.
I know this because I was on my bike and checked out the sight lines myself.
Hmm.
Well, you see, Billy...
Bobby.
Like it matters.
I grew my hedge tall for a reason.
So I wouldn't have to see your family.
Thank you for your concern.
Loco!
Loco!
You are standing too close to the vehicle.
¶ I've seen the future, and this is... ¶
¶ ...warmer, girl ¶
¶ Making the music softer... ¶
See you later.
Hey, there, groovy chick.
Oh, great.
Do I look like a yellow, fuzzy baby bird to you?
Hey, that's funny, Donna.
You know, you are really happening in a far-out way.
How about you and me going out for a soda after school?
Sorry.
I got a step class.
If you're having problems with your steps maybe you should let me carry your books to history class.
I can hold my own books, and it's not history... it's "herstory."
Wow.
Hi, everybody.
¶ A goddess on a mountaintop ¶
¶ Was burnin' like a silver flame... ¶
Hey, Marcia.
Hello, Doug Simpson.
¶ And Venus was her name... ¶
God, she drives me crazy!
I got to have that.
I live next door to her.
And she's harder to get into than a Pearl Jam concert.
What are you guys talking about?
Just how twisted the Bradys are.
Especially Marcia.
What a retro-wannabe.
I think Peter's a babe.
Well, in a Gilligan sort of way.

Biology.

What?
¶ Wow!
¶
¶ She's got it ¶
¶ Yeah, baby, she's got it... ¶
Hi, Marcia.
Hi.
Oh, guess what?
My mom said I can sleep over.
Oh, really?
That's great, Noreen.
Guess what else.
Doug just said hi to me.
He is so dreamy, isn't he?
Yeah, I guess.
If you like that sort of thing.
So, can I carry your books to class?
Sure, Noreen.
After all, you are my best friend.
Uh-oh.
Here comes Doug.
Go away.
Sure.
No, no.
Stay.
Okay.
No, no.
Leave.
Fine.
No, no.
Stay.
And pretend I just said something really funny.
What?
Oh.
Hi, Marcia.
What's up?
Oh.
Um... hi, Doug.
Listen, I was just wondering, if you're not doing anything.
Friday night, maybe you'd like to go to the dance with me.
Sure.
That would be a blast.
Cool.
You'll hear from me.
Great.
He's so outtasight.
Oh, my gosh!
I just remembered.
What?
I already told Charlie
I would go to the dance with him.
So?
So I can't go out with two boys at once.
I like Charlie, but Doug is so cute.
And, after all, he is the big man on campus.
Noreen, what am I going to do?
This is the worst mess I've ever gotten myself into.
The worst!
Oh...
My life is over!
So, that is what males experience during the onset of puberty.
Now, as far as the young women are concerned...
First, we begin with ovulation and its effect on the female body.
Peter?
Yes, Miss Lynley?
Why don't you come up here and take the pointer...
and we will trace the path of the ovum through the fallopian tube, where the uterine lining is flushed through the vagina.
Ohh...
Oh!
Peter!
Peter!
So, Jan, what can I help you with?
Teen pregnancy?
Bulimia?
Suicidal tendencies?
No.
It's my stupid glasses.
Oh.
I know I should wear them.
I look at myself in the mirror every morning and I say to myself, "Jan, put on your glasses."
But then I say, "You look like a super creep.
Take them off."
It's like my head tells me to do different things and I get very confused.
Inner voices?
Good.
That's good.
Let's explore that.
What does she mean, "inner voices"?
I don't think that's any of her business.
But it's her job to ask questions.
You are so dumb.
I don't have "inner voices."
Now, Jan, paranoid schizophrenia is very common amongst children of blended families.
You are the middle child, aren't you?
Middle child?
Don't you mean Marcia Brady's little sister?
Wait a minute.
She's just trying to help.
Help?
Wake up!
She's just looking for an excuse to bring up Marcia.
Marcia!
Marcia!
Marcia!
Yes!
I'm in the middle!
Well, it sounds like you have a serious case of...
"middle child syndrome."
But you needn't worry.
Here's a copy of my book... and my tapes.
In the meantime, do something to make yourself stand out... give you your own look... apart from your siblings.
A new look.
That's it.
Gee, thanks, Mrs. Cummings.
Jan, come back when you're pregnant.
And, girl, you better work.
¶ Work it down ¶
¶ Do your thing... ¶
There ain't no justice!
Hi, Holly.
Hi.
Can I give you a hand?
Yeah.
Thanks.
I'm over here.
Hey...
Petey.
Look, Leon.
It's Holly's little friend.
Hey, knock it off or I'll...
Or you'll what?
Dittmeyer!
Do it and die.
I'm going to get you, Brady.
A $20,000 advance?
I'd like to, Mike, but we're still hurting from the recession.
I only have three developers coming all this week.
Let me have a shot at those projects, Mr. Phillips.
If I can sell one of them my design you could front me the advance, right?
Sure, but...
How should I put this delicately, Mike?
Your designs are from another time.
That's kind of you to say, Mr. Phillips.
I've always thought of my style as "classic," as well.
I'll get right to work.
Well, Mr. Amir, what do you think?
I love it.
But it's too... interesting.
I want something simple.
A couple of self-serve pump and a Slurpee machine.
Sorry.
It's only strike one, Mr. Phillips.
I've still got two more times at bat.
Cinderella, dressed in yellow, went to the ball to kiss the fellow.
Hey, Heidi, go yodel in your own yard, huh?
Okay, Mr. Dittmeyer.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey, little girl!
I got to get something out of my truck.
Don't let anybody touch this wire.
Can you do that?
Of course.
Daddy, there's a Brady in our yard!
I thought I told you to stay in your own yard.
Yes.
But you see, Mr. Dittmeyer, I'm simply standing here...
You know, the lisp thing is really getting old.
So why don't you hop back on the Swiss Miss package where you belong, huh?
Okay.
Oh.
Don't forget your jump rope.
Ohh...
Try it and you're Spam.
Well, Mr. Brady, did you hit a home run today?
My design didn't even make it to first base.
You know, maybe we should think about taking Mr. Dittmeyer up on his offer.
You're serious about selling the house?
Carol, I designed this house myself... every color, every brick, every sheet of Formica.
If I knew another way out, I'd take it.
But where else are we going to find
$20,000 by the end of the week?
Oh, no.
We're going to have to sell our house.
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ Beanstalks never grew ¶
¶ No one ever loved... ¶
What is it, Cindy?
I'm busy writing a song for Danielle.
I have to tell you something.
Okay.
But I can't tell you, 'cause that would be tattling.
Come on, Cindy.
If it's important, it's not tattling.
I'm never going to tell that Mom and Dad have to sell the house because they owe
$20,000.
Oops.
And that's why I called this meeting.
Greg, what are we going to do?
Yeah.
If we don't raise $20,000 in one week, we'll have to move.
And go to a new school.
And make new friends.
But, Jan, you don't have any friends.
Wait.
We can save the house.
We can raise the money ourselves.
But how?
Well, we can each get jobs and earn extra money.
Hey, neato idea.
Gee, there are so many things I'm good at.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Oh, I'm just so perfect at so many things.
You're just jealous, Jan.
I'm going to make some serious cash.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I bet I can make more than you.
With what, shrimpo?
Your tooth fairy money?
Who are you calling "shrimpo"?
Hey, Mom always said don't play ball in the house.
Hey, you guys, stop fighting!
If we're going to save this house for Mom and Dad, we've each got to make as much as we can.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, Jan, you don't have any friends.
You're just jealous, Jan.
Jan!
What are you doing?
Go back to sleep, Cindy.
Jan, don't!
Marcia's hair is so beautiful.
Exactly.
That's why
I'm going to get a lot of money when I sell it.
Jan, what are you doing?
Oh, Marcia.
I love your hair.
Ooh!
What a groovy hairdo.
Oh, you're so beautiful!
No!
She's supposed to look bad.
No!
Nooooo!
What a horrible dream.
Greg, have you gone bananas?
No.
I just found a way to save our house.
I'm going to become a rock star.
That's great, Greg, but I need some advice about something really important.
See, Charlie asked me to the dance and I said yes.
Then Doug asked me, and I said yes to him, too.
What am I going to do?
Well, you just tell the guy you don't want to go with that something suddenly came up.
And that works?
Sure.
Girls say it to me all the time.
Hey, Marcia.
Oh, hi, Charlie.
I can't wait until the dance Friday night.
Oh.
Um... about the dance, Charlie... well, something suddenly came up.
Oh.
Oh, well, you know, that's okay.
Maybe some other time?
Sure.
Bye.
Bye.
Greg was right.
Well, that takes care of that problem.
Let's see what's next.
Hmm.
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ Beanstalks never grew... ¶
"Attention!
"Missing school office supplies.
Reward offered."
Office supplies?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah.
I heard it before.
You know, I've got reward money riding on this.
Now, spread 'em.
Oh, come on, Mrs. Whitfield!
You're going to have to do better than that!
Boy, you sure have some strong thigh muscles, Mrs. Whitfield.
But I've been here for hours!
Please!
You won't regret it!
I guarantee it!
Please.
Weren't you ever a kid with a dream of making something of yourself?
"Clowns"?
"Beanstalks"?
What the hell is this?
This is a guaranteed gold record!
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ And beanstalks... ¶
No.
Look, what did you say your name was again?
Bravo...
Johnny Bravo.
Listen...
"Bravo..."
today's sound is raw, with an edge.
Seattle... grunge...
garage bands...
Don't they have beanstalks in Seattle?
Well, hey, there, groovy chick.
Mmm... uh-uh.
Yeah.
It went fabulous.
Put the head back on, Fletcher.
Listen, I am closing in on the, uh... on the Bradys, though.
Can I call you back, Mr. Feldman?
My car phone's ringing.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm calling from a marketing firm.
We'd just like a few minutes of your time...
Ow!
Do you ever use pens and pencils?
I know you do...
Oh, hi, Mrs. Dittmeyer!
I'm here to see Eric.
Oh, hi, Greggie.
Oh, Greg...
I'm so glad you're here.
I've got some more of your mail.
Oh.
Oh, gee, your hands are full.
Let me just...
My, you've... gotten so big.
You're almost as big as your daddy.
And I'm still growing.
Right... before my very eyes.
Your pants are... so tight.
Hey, Mrs. Dittmeyer.
Peter!
Can I mow your lawn?
I'm trying to earn some extra money.
Sure.
Two Bradys...
Tell you what...
when you boys are done, why don't you come inside and help me make a sandwich?
Penny for your thoughts.
How about 20,000 of them?
You're worried about the house, aren't you?
I told you I'd take care of everything.
Oh, Mike, it's just that we're so happy here.
I sure would miss our kitchen and our garden... and Alice!
If we lose her, who'll make the lunches I pass out?
And who'll answer the phone:
"Brady residence."
And who'll help me...
Honey, Alice isn't going anywhere, and neither are we.
Besides, she doesn't do everything around her.
Time to put your bookmark in, Mr. Brady.
I sure am glad your mom let you sleep over on a school night.
Marcia, I have to tell you something.
Hmm?
You are the prettiest girl in the entire school.
I know.
But how can I use my good looks and sparkling personality to make money and save our house?
That's it!
I could be a teen model!
Oh, thanks, Noreen!
You're the greatest!
Oh...
Noreen?
Hmm?
Is that you?
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought that was my leg.
Oh...
Night.
Sweet dreams, Marcia.
I still don't know why you had to tag along.
This is my thing.
You're not the only one who can be a model, you know.
Ooh... those are pretty pictures.
What have you modeled for?
Guess.
Um... are you a Breck girl?
No. "Guess" jeans.
Okay, um...
Levis...
Wrangler...
Oshkosh B'Gosh?
Brady girls?
That's us.
So... you're professional models?
Yes, we are!
Of course!
So, what do you have to show me?
Plenty.
Oh...
Why don't we take five?
You.
Wow...
Thank you!
Why does everyone always choose Marcia?
!
What does she have that I don't have?
!
Now, Marcia, I may be able to use you, but first, you're going to have to do a little work on yourself.
You mean like walking with a book on my head?
No.
I mean like cutting that mousy hair, capping those teeth and losing about 30 pounds, my little sausage.
How do you feel about breast implants?
Cut my hair?
!
And, after much consideration, Mr. Swanson,
I designed a structure especially for your needs.
So, what do you think?
Well, it's just too good a design for a fast food joint.
You see what I'm saying, Phillips?
This is...
I think you're pumping a dry well here.
You understand what I'm saying?
All right.
I'll be in touch with you.
Sorry, Mikey.
Well... strike two.
There's got to be a way to make $20,000.
Hey!
"Search for the Stars is looking
"for fresh young musical acts.
First prize: $20,000."
Hmm...
Too bad I'm not a musical act.
Hey, Marcia!
I'm not Marcia!
I'm Jan!
The usual, Sam.
Sure thing, Mrs. Brady.
20 pounds of ground round coming right up.
Carol, are you still eating red meat?
Why, of course!
I've got growing kids!
I have to think about their health!
Isn't Sam the best?
We're sure going to miss this place when we move, won't we?
Oh, we're not moving.
You're not?
I thought everyone on the block was.
Mike says there's no reason to sell.
We'll be here forever.
There you go, Mrs. Brady.
Thanks, Sam.
Have a nice day.
Bye, Sam.
Bye.
Marcia, could you call the troops to dinner?
In a second.
I'm just checking for a letter from Davy Jones.
Nothing.
Oh, Alice, if I don't get an answer from him soon,
I'll be the most humiliated girl in the world.
You think waiting three weeks for an answer is rough?
Try waiting 20 years for the question.
Alice.
Hey, Greg, you're the Casanova of Clinton Avenue.
How can I get Holly to go for me?
Well, chicks love compliments, man.
Just tell her how groovy she is.
And that really works?
Trust me.
It always gets a reaction.
Now, throw me a pass.
24, 32, set, hike.
Dinner's ready...
Ooh, my nose!
Are you all right?
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Marcia.
Yeah, me, too.
Let's have a look, Marcia.
I look awful, just awful.
I can never show my face in school again.
I'm ruined.
Sweetheart, I know you feel terrible, but it's going to get better.
I'm sure no one will ever notice.
Oh, my goodness.
What happened to your...?
Mother's favorite picture?
It's crooked.
I mean the painting's crooked.
I think I'd better go.
I think I hear the nose boy.
I mean the newsboy.
Oh, boy, did I blow it.
Now I'll never be a teen model.
I'll never be anything.
What's the point of living?
I might as well die.
Don't forget my $10 reward money.
I made more than you... almost $12.
Well, I got $15 from Mrs. Dittmeyer.
Boy, is she a good tipper.
But we're still nowhere near $20,000.
This is just awful.
You can say that again.
Tonight's the school dance and my nose still hasn't gone down.
Hey, I saw something on the bulletin board at school about a "Search for the Stars" contest.
They're looking for fresh, young musical groups.
First prize is exactly $20,000.
Oh, sure, Jan, like we'd really win.
Oh, Jan...
We'd never have a chance of winning.
We might as well rob a bank.
Guys, there's no point in fighting.
We're running out of time, and we still have to find a way out of this mess.
I sure am going to miss this house.
Uh-oh.
Here comes Mom and Dad.
All right, now, remember, everyone, act happy.
We can't let on that we know anything.
Mike, you don't think the kids suspect anything, do you?
Oh, no, of course not.
Well, just to make sure, we should act extra happy.
Well, you know what makes us the happiest.
Potato sack race!
Get ready... get set... go!
So, what can I do you for?
You can explain to me what Mrs. Brady told my wife.
Yeah, if Mike Brady won't sell, we're all screwed.
Well, allow me to take this opportunity to set the record straight.
The Bradys are selling, my clients are buying and you are all making out like bandits.
Scotch, Steve?
Are you calling my wife a liar?
Steve, no.
I'm just saying you can't believe the Bradys.
You've all seen the insane stuff that goes on over there.
How about this Astroturf lawn they treat like real grass, huh?
And, excuse me... the family that's happy all the time?
Not possible.
It is strange how they spend their weekends... hopping around in potato sacks.
And you know something?
Yeah.
I hear that their maid works for free.
Can you understand that?
No.
I can't.
No.
You know, I was over there once.
One bathroom for nine people?
Get out of here.
Oh, stop, please.
And I never did see a toilet.
Please, they've got to put it somewhere.
Come on.
I rest my case.
Hi.
I'm Doug Simpson.
Marcia's date?
Oh, right...
the big man on campus.
Come on in, Doug.
Marcia, Doug's here!
Hi, Doug.
Big man on campus, huh?
Yeah, right.
Hi, Doug.
Hi, Marcia.
Is anything wrong?
Sweetheart, I think you better show him.
I suppose you don't want to go out with me now, huh?
Oh, of course I do.
It's not your nose I'm after.
That's a fine boy.
Marcia's got there.
Oh, Marcia, it looks like rain.
You better take your shawl.
Thanks.
Uh, Doug, how about you?
Do you have any protection?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Assorted colors and textures.
Good for you.
Have fun, kids.
Bye-bye.
¶ Are you coming with me?
¶
But, Doug, this isn't the school dance.
I just figured we'd come up here and unwind a little bit before we go down.
Mind if I change the station?
Oh, it is windy tonight.
Maybe we should put the top up.
I'll keep you warm, Marcia.
Uh...
Doug, your hand is on my shoulder.
So?
Well, that's third base, and I don't go that far.
Doug, I think I just felt your tongue in my mouth.
That's called a French kiss, Marcia.
I thought you were from Nebraska.
I am.
Listen, Doug, I don't know what you were thinking, but I don't do things like that.
You may live your life one way, but we Bradys follow our own drummer.
So, I hope this doesn't sour the rest of our date.
You Bradys suck!
Excuse me.
Oh, no, thank you.
I don't take rides from strangers.
I was just wondering how to get to West Dale High School.
West Dale High?
¶ How do you do?
¶
¶ Yeah ¶
¶ So now I'm pissed off ¶
¶ My head is a twist-off ¶
¶ I never have been cute ¶
¶ I need more money 'cause my life is crummy ¶
¶ And get that stuff off my shoe ¶
¶ It is a cruel world, I'm no schoolgirl ¶
¶ I never do what I should ¶
¶ And they never know, it's about to blow... ¶
Hey, you're one groovy chick.
You're really happening in a far-out way.
Thanks.
Peter!
Yeah!
Excuse me.
Can I have your attention, please?
You may all know me as Greg Brady, but tonight, I'd like to introduce you to...
Johnny Bravo!
For my first song,
I'd like to sing a number I wrote for the grooviest chick at West Dale High.
One, two three, four... ¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ Beanstalks never grew ¶
¶ Ponies never ran before ¶
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
¶ Does it scare you ¶
¶ When you see me lose my mind... ¶
¶ I go crazy... ¶
Hi, everybody.
It's the new Jan Brady.
Am I a hit?
Do you like it?
Hmm.
Wow.
It worked.
I really did make a splash.
Can I have your attention, please?
I have some news that's going to make everyone flip.
Hey... what about me?
I thought he might show up, but I didn't want to get all your hopes up.
Marcia did it again.
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!
But here he is...
Davy Jones!
Hey, Grandpa...
Oh, man!
Thanks a lot for being here, Davy...
I mean, Mr. Jones.
Anything for my number-one fan.
¶ Girl ¶
¶ Look what you've done to me ¶
Look, it really is Davy Jones!
¶ Me ¶
¶ And my whole world ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ You've brought ¶
¶ The sun to me ¶
¶ With your smile ¶
¶ You did it, girl ¶
¶ I'm telling you, girl ¶
¶ Something not ¶
¶ Known to me ¶
¶ Makes ¶
¶ You what you are... ¶
Hi, Charlie.
Hey, Marcia.
It was rude of me to break our date.
How can I make it up to you?
Well, uh... gee, Marcia, how about a dance?
Why, I'd love to, Charlie Anderson.
¶ ...that way, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ For making the morning brighter ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making the nighttime nicer ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making a better world ¶
¶ For me ¶
¶ I'm telling you, girl ¶
¶ Something unknown to me ¶
¶ Makes ¶
¶ You what you are ¶
¶ And what you are ¶
¶ Is all that I want for me ¶
¶ And it's good ¶
¶ To feel that way, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ For making the winter warmer ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making the music softer ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making a better world for me ¶
¶ And what you are ¶
¶ Is all that I want for me ¶
¶ And it's good ¶
¶ To feel that way, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl... ¶
Hey, where are you going?
Something suddenly came up.
Hey, Marcia, you looked great up there.
Thanks, Noreen.
Hey, Marcia, you got a sec?
Forget it, Doug.
Even with a swollen nose,
I can still smell a rat.
Slut.
Um...
Marcia, would you get our coats.
I have a little, uh...
matter to discuss.
Sure, Charlie.
Hey...
I heard what you said, Doug... and I'm not going to let you talk to Marcia like that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, what are you going to do about it, geek?
I-I'm going to...
lose... consciousness.
Hey, Doug.
How's about a little punch?
Is he dead?
Wow.
Charlie, thanks.
Couldn't have done it better myself.
Here.
Are you okay?
I really had a great time, Marcia.
Yeah, me, too, Charlie.
Well, uh...
Bye.
Bye.
Uh, Marcia?
So, um... can, uh... can I have a kiss good night?
Yeah.
Okay, Charlie.
Marcia...
I think I just felt your tongue in my mouth.
It's called a French kiss, Charlie.
Um...
Marcia, I got to go.
Uh, something suddenly came up.
32, 24, hike.
Dinner's ready.
Oh, my nose!
What a nice dream.
Jan, what is it?
Has my nose gotten worse?
No.
It's better.
The hardest thing about the health club business is getting people to leave their house.
Well... what do you think?
I love it.
Consider yourself hired.
Uh-huh.
You would?
I see.
Ahh.
All right.
Mom, Dad?
Hey, why the gloom?
Well, we just had a kid meeting and, well, we decided that we don't mind if we have to move.
We tried to raise the money for the tax bill ourselves, but there are only two days left and all we could come up with was $110.
What?
How did you know about the house and the tax bill?
Oops!
Cindy, do I have to remind you that when you tattle on somebody, you're not just telling on them, you're telling on yourself and...
Telling them that you're a tattletale.
We've heard it, Dad.
Thanks.
Kids, you have nothing to worry about.
Today your father sold a design and now he can get that $20,000 advance.
I appreciate what you all tried to do and from now on, no more secrets.
The important thing is we still have our home so, let's celebrate.
Put on your Sunday best, kids.
We're going to Sears.
¶ I think I'll go for a walk outside now ¶

Oh, Alice.
Hey, everybody, look.
Come on, gang, let's have a look.

"Joint consolidated tax bill:
Final notice."
"Dear Mr. Brady...
"due to your failure to pay... house will be auctioned 2:00 p.m. tomorrow..."
$20,000.
Dina?
Dina... this is the greatest day of our lives.
Did the kids run away?
No.
We are rich.
We are going to be filthy, stinking, disgustingly rich.
Larry?
Yeah?
Get me my ice mask.
Forget your ice mask.
We're going to be so rich you can hire an Eskimo to sit on your face.
It's open.
Of course it is.
Morning.
Morning, Larry.
If you're here about the offer, the answer's still no.
I haven't changed my mind.
No need for that.
I know you won't be selling this house because, after the auction tomorrow at 2:00, I'll own it.
Well, I don't think there'll be any auction.
What?
Well, luckily, I just sold one of my designs, so it looks like the Bradys are here to stay.
So, which firm was lucky enough to snag one of your designs, Mike?
And, of course if you ever need a property for one of your health clubs
I'm your man.
Oh, thank you.
Well, well.
What have we here?
This is one of our new gyms that we're constructing.
We are negotiating to buy the design right now.
Really?
Who's your architect?
A very talented fellow... name of Brady.
I guess you won't be breaking ground until after he dries out.
Dries out?
I really shouldn't say anything.
Guy's been through a lot lately, what with the charges filed against him and everything.
Charges?
Criminal negligence.
A building he designed completely collapsed.
Old folks home, Christmas day.
All those cute, little visiting grandchildren... some with puppies.
Let's take a moment to honor their memory, shall we?
I'll get it.
Brady residence.
You did?
I see.
When?
Uh-huh.
They did?
Why not?
Uh-huh... oh.
Yeah?
Right.
Well... bye.
Bad news, I'm afraid.
Oh, Mike.
What?
The Flex factory pulled out of the project this morning.
They're not going with my design.
Oh, Mike.
Why?
Well, they wouldn't say.
I guess this means it's over.
Unless a miracle happens by 2:00 tomorrow, the county is going to auction our house.
Oh, Mike.
How?
Kids, I'm afraid the money that we were counting on is no longer a possibility.
But I want you to remember that no matter where we go, or whatever house we're in, we'll be fine as long as we're together, so I don't want to see any more frowns.
We're Bradys.
And as a wise man once said:
"Wherever you go, there you are."
I never thought of it that way, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
Boy, this is crummy.
Well, there must be some way out of this mess.
Everybody think.
Hey, I've got it.
We can enter that "Search for the Stars" contest.
First prize is exactly $20,000.
Hey, that's a nifty idea, Marcia.
Great idea, Marcia.
Good idea, Marcia.
Am I invisible?
Do I not have a voice?
I had that idea two days ago.
Stop being so selfish, Jan.
Come on, Jan.
Oh, Jan.
Jan. Jan.
Come on, you guys, we got a big day ahead of us.
We better get some rest if we're going to be a fresh, young musical group.
It was my idea.
Mine.
Didn't anybody hear me?
I heard you.
Me, too, but it sounded better coming from Marcia.
Sam, that was the juiciest Meat Cutters' Ball
I've ever been to.
I'm cooked.
Alice, I want you to stick out your hand and close your eyes.
I got a surprise for you.
Unless it fits on my finger, I've got to hit the sack.
It better fit, or I'm going to have to take it back.
Sam, I thought this day would never come.
When I saw it,
I thought it was right up your alley.
I'm bowled over.
I always thought our grandchildren would come visit us in this house.
Oh, Mike.
You know, this is going to be our last night in this bedroom.
Why, Grandpa Brady.
Jan, where are you going?
Someplace where I can be appreciated.
Go ahead and snitch if you want.
Just give me a head start.
I wouldn't snitch.
But how will we sing without you?
Why don't you ask Marcia?
Maybe she has another brilliant idea.
Mom?
Dad?
Uh... what is it, Cindy?
If you know something, but you don't want to be a tattle, but it's very important that you tell someone...
Cindy, let's talk about it tomorrow.
But Jan could be dead by then!
What?
!
Oops!
Why would Jan run away like this?
Maybe we were thinking too much about our problems and not enough about the kids.
Did anyone say anything that would make Jan run away?
Nothing more than what we usually say to her.
Yeah.
I'll get Alice.
Oh.
Hi, folks.
Sam, what are you doing here?
Oh, I was just, um, delivering some meat.
Well, it's a good thing you're here.
Jan ran away, and we need you and Alice to help find her.
We'll circle the block.
You check the school.
Come on, gang, let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, everybody, hurry up.
Come on.
Come on, Cindy.
I call the way back.
I got the backseat.
What happened?
Did an animal die on your head?
Hey, lose the hat.
You'll be okay.
Keep your eyes peeled, everybody.
Breaker, one-nine, breaker, one-nine, this is Christmas Carol.
Honey, no one's answered us in years.
Oh, Mike, I have to try.
Breaker, one-nine, do you read me?
Anyone out there?
I need a 20 on a little girl.
Blond, blue-eyed, answers to the name of Jan.
Tell her...
Mother Hen and Father Goose love her very much.
Come after me if you're out there, over.
Huh.
Sounds like some family misses somebody they love very much.
I don't have a family.
Oh, no family.
You know, sometimes
I'm driving the graveyard shift in the middle of nowhere,
I can't help thinking what might have been if I'd taken a different road... married young, had a family... three boys, three girls.
Oh, then a little voice says, "Are you kidding?
They'd probably just treat you like a maid."
Do you want some of this, Jan?
No, thanks.
You have a little voice, too?
Mmm.
Oh, honey, when you're on the road as long as I am, you got to talk to somebody.
That's a trick I learned growing up.
It's tough being a middle child.
You're a middle child.
So am I.
Then you know what it feels like not being special.
What does she mean, "I'm not special?"
Hey, she's just trying to help.
My family's not much.
No kids, though we do have a lot of livestock.
Jan!
Oh, Jan!
Don't listen to her!
In this day and age, if you're lucky enough...
Who is that?
It's me... the new Jan Brady.
Let's knock over a 7-Eleven.
Stop!
You're scaring me!
Me, too.
Me, too!
Mom?
Dad?
Hi.
I'm back.
Marcia?
Cindy?
Are you up there?
Greg?
Peter?
Bobby?
Alice?
Sam?
Christmas Carol, this is Schultzy, come back to me.
Schultzy!
Th-this is Christmas Carol.
I got a 20 on a little girl.
Blue eyes, blonde hair, answers to the name of Jan.
I just dropped her off at 4222 Clinton Way.
Thank you, Schultzy, thank you and God bless!
Over.
That's a big ten-four.
Jan?
Jan, are you here?
Mom?
Dad?
Oh, honey!
Oh, honey!
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm so glad you're safe!
Oh, honey, what on earth made you run away?
I thought no one wanted me here anymore, but when I was out in the real world,
I realized that I wanted me to be here.
You're all a part of me and I'm a part of you, and there's no escaping that... but it makes me feel really special.
I couldn't have put it better myself, Jan, but I'll try anyway.
See, I've always believed that it doesn't matter where your home is, because home is where your heart is, and we may lose this house, but we'll always have our family because we're Bradys,
and this family is our home.
That's why we'll always have our home.
As long as we have our family, even if we lose our house, we're still Bradys.
Your father's right.
Oh, yeah, absolutely, Dad.
Maybe we can still save the house.
How about Jan's idea of the "Search for the Stars" contest?
Jan's idea?
Yes, it was Jan's, and it's a really great plan.
What's "Search for the Stars?"
It's a contest for the best musical group, and there's a first prize of $20,000.
And singing one of Greg's songs, we're sure to win.
Well, then, you're going to have to sing it without me.
Huh?
What?
Why?
I thought I could change my name and my personality and become some big, flashy rock star, but I was just kidding myself.
Nobody liked my act.
I guess I just don't have what it takes.
Well, let's face it,
Johnny Bravo's nothing but...
Johnny Rotten.
You're right, son.
Johnny Bravo doesn't have what it takes... but Greg Brady does.
He has us, and this family can accomplish anything.
Alone, we can only move buckets, but if we work together, we can drain rivers.
Your father's right.
The eight of us separate are just eight... well, with Alice, we're nine, but nine...
Yes, well, technically...
And with Sam, ten, but ten separate, just ten.
Together... we're a Bunch.
Yeah.
The Brady Bunch.
What do you say, Greg?
Please?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Grab some costumes.
We've got to make that contest!
Okay!
All right!
¶ We are blood ¶
¶ We don't vote ¶
¶ We are standing all alone ¶
¶ At the beginning ¶
¶ Of the end ¶
¶ We are phlegm ¶
¶ We are phlegm. ¶
I'm so nervous.
Why am I so nervous?
Stop it.
You're making me nervous.
All right, let's have a big hand for Phlegm.
Yay!
You sounded hot.
What, are you...
completely brain-dead?
Leon missed an entire riff.
Didn't you hear it?
I liked it.
You're such a loser.
Hey, Eric.
I'm sick and tired of seeing you treat Holly that way.
In fact...
I'm sick and tired of you altogether.
You're nothing but a... a big bully.
You're dog meat, Brady.
Do it... and die, Eric.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh.
Hurry, Peter.
We're on.
Thanks, Peter.
I think you're really... neato.
- Oh, yes.
- I hope everybody's having a good time.
Why, uh... thank you, Holly.
I think you're...
Ginger and Mary Ann combined.
Come on, Peter.
That's us.
See ya.
Good luck.

Thank you, Brady Bunch.
You were great.
Great.
Give the rest of our contestants a big hand as our judges tally up the scores.
Thank you.
And I have it right here.
The winner of the Search for the Stars $20,000 grand prize is... the Brady Bunch?
Hey, great job.
Thanks.
They what?
!
How could those losers win anything?
Look, Eric, you got to stall them for me.
What do you mean, what's in it for you?
All right, you have my permission to pierce anything you want.
Just keep them from getting here.
Damn kid.
Come on.
Well, here it is.
A check made out to the Brady Bunch for $20,000.
Come on, gang, let's go.
Hurry!
All right, everybody.
Let's hear it for them Bradys.
They were something else.
Thanks for coming down.
I hope you had a good time and we'll see you...
Come on, come on.
Let's go, troops!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Hey, there, groovy chicks.
You're all happening in far out ways.
Greg, hurry.
The house.
Now, how do you suppose that happened?
Oh, Mike.
What are we going to do?
Hey, Marcia, look.
It's our friend, Eddie.
You remember.
The guy who needed a car jack.
Come on, everybody.
He can give us a lift.
Hey, Eddie!
Oh, no.
Can you give us a ride?
A ride?
Good afternoon.
Having trouble with the car alarm?
No.
It's not our car.
It's our friend Eddie's.
Oh, really?
Where are the keys, Eddie?
I lost them.
Oh, no.
But we were counting on you to give us a ride to our house.
I'll run the plate.
Uh, excuse me, Officer but I'd hate to ask a law enforcement official to bend the rules... especially for penal code 117 section 33-B, but our house is at stake.
Please?
2:00.
Auction time.
It's exciting, isn't it, Alice?
By the power authorized me by the county of Los Angeles,
I hereby offer this property to the highest bidder, unless the owner redeems...
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'll start the bidding at the sum total of back taxes: $20,000.
Do I have any takers?
Say...
I've got $20,000.
Stop the auction!
We have the money for the tax bill.
I repeat, stop the auction.
We have the money for the tax bill.
The house is still ours.
Come on, kids.
Hold everything.
Good news, everybody.
The Bradys are here to stay.
You lied to us, Dittmeyer.
The Bradys aren't selling.
I knew it!
You guaranteed us!
You ruined us, Dittmeyer.
You're going to pay for this.
Now, hold on, people.
Wait a minute.
The man you should be angry with is me, 'cause our house is more important than money.
This neighborhood is more important than money.
Tell me, how many times have we borrowed each other's power tools or patched up each other's kids?
We know so much about each other.
I know that every January, Mr. Yeager's going to have that big Super Bowl party at his house.
Yeah.
We know every spring Mrs. Simmons is going to have the prettiest daffodils on the block.
They are beautiful.
They are lovely flowers.
We know that at 10:15 every Saturday morning,
Mrs. Topping likes to walk through her living room naked.
You knew about that?
Call me old-fashioned, but these things are important and they're not for sale.
This is our neighborhood... and we're staying.
Now, this is going to sound crazy... but Brady's right.
We're never going to find another neighborhood like this.
And we'll never find neighbors like the Bradys.
We're staying, too.
Us, too.
So are we.
We will, too.
Great.
Gosh, I wish I lived here.
I mean, it's...
it's incredible.
You people are all staying... because one family is willing to stand up for what they believe in?
Well... that and the huge settlement we're going to get after we sue Dittmeyer's ass.
Oh, Mike.
I always knew you could hit a grand slam and now we can stay in our house after all.
Hey, do you know who'd love to hear about this?
Grandma!
Hey.
Hi, everybody.
Wait a minute.
Look, how pretty you have gotten.
Oh, those clothes.
Oh, what taste.
And that smile...
Oh, Marcia, you are such a beauty.
Everyone loves Marcia.
No one loves you.
Watch my head spin.
Kill, kill, kill!
No, stop it!
I can't take it anymore!
Aw, shut up, you loser!
Jan!
Cut the crap.
They're gone.
Thank you, Grandma.
Oh, there.
Cindy.
Oh, Cindy.
Why does Jan get all the attention?
Yeah.
It's always Jan, Jan, Jan.

Well, that's what's brilliant about you, Mr. Feldman.
No one else would have thought of building a residential mini-mall.
Now that I've got everyone else on the block to agree to your offer, I think we're...
It's got to be everyone on the block... everyone... or the deal's off.
Oh, we're headed into the canyon.
I think I'm losing you.
Mr. Feldman.
Cut the crap, Dittmeyer.
Did you get everyone or not?
Well, there's this one family that's holding out.
Then sweeten the deal.
Up the offer.
It's not that simple.
It's like they're not interested in money.
It's like they're not normal.
Why the hell not?
What's their story?
¶ Here's the story of a lovely lady ¶

¶ That's the way we became the Brady Bunch. ¶
Don't worry about me.
I'm okay.
Morning, Mrs. Brady.
Oh, thanks, Alice.
Morning, Alice.
Careful, Mr. Brady.
Don't bend over.
We've gotten the Dittmeyers' mail again, sweetheart.
You'd think, after all these years they'd know who lives where.
Well, I always know where to deliver my mail.
Mr. Brady...
Mommy, Marcia's been in the bathroom for a super-long time.
Now, Cindy, we've told you before... no one likes a tattletale.
But, Daddy...
Your father's right, sweetheart.
Why don't you help Alice make some cookies?
Okay, Mommy.
But can my doll help, too?
As long as it's not Betsy Wetsy.
She makes my cookies soggy woggy.
Oh, Alice.
Mmm.
4,998...
Come on, Marcia, open up.
I've got to shave.
4,999...
Gosh, Marcia, there are other people in this family besides you.
5,000.
Come on, Marcia.
Doug Simpson's sure to notice me today.
All finished.
Finally.
Greg.
Jan, you're just going to have to wait your turn.
It's never my turn.
Jan, did you move my trophies?
Yes.
I couldn't look in the mirror without seeing the awards of the great Marcia Brady.
I believe these are my white kneesocks.
Not everything in this room is yours.
See, Jan?
I told you they were mine.
Now, put them back, and don't forget to close the drawer when you're done.
She has every right to be mad.
They are her socks.
But why does Marcia get all the socks?
Why does Marcia get all the trophies?
Why does Marcia get all the good drawers?
Yeah.
Why does Marcia get everything?
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.
It's closed!
Come on, Greg.
Hurry up.
Boy, he's worse than Marcia.
Hmm.
Hey, what's wrong with your voice?
Well, my libido is increasing at a rapid rate and the surge of hormones causes dramatic physical and emotional changes.
Well, that's what Miss Lynley told us in health class.
Finally.
Yeah.
Well, you kids have no idea what it takes to impress a chick.
Maybe, someday, when you're older you'll get hip to what it's like being a man.
Good news, Greg.
I'm putting on your favorite Scooby Doo bedsheets.
Scooby Dooby doo!
Honey, I think you've stirred that enough.
I'm not stirring.
I'm looking for Kitty Carryall's underpants.
I tell you what.
Why don't I take over the cookies, and you run these letters to the Dittmeyers and see if they've gotten any of our mail by mistake.
Okay, Mommy.
Missy, get your butt-ugly face down here!
Hello, Eric.
Are your parents home?
Blow off, cheeseball.
Missy!
Shut up before you have a toxic dump.
Hello, Missy.
How's your science project coming?
I finished mine.
What are you going to do?
Hand in your face and call it barf mold?
Thee you on the theethaw, Thindy.
Bye.
Look, Mr. Feldman, I promised they'd sell, and they will.
Like the Bates deal.
Yeah, I know I took it in the rear on that subdivision, but this time,
I'm the one who's doing the screwing.
Yeah, well, just make sure one holdout family doesn't wreck this.
You hear me?
Look, can I call you back?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hello, Mr. Dittmeyer.
Why are you here?
Oh.
Thanks.
Mom asked me to ask you if there's mail for us here by mistake.
I...
I don't understand you.
What do you want?
Mom asked me to ask you if there's any mail for us here by mistake.
What?
Mom asked me to ask you if there's any mail for us here by mistake.
Nope.
Not a clue.
She wants the Bradys' mail, Larry!
Thank you, darling.
So kind of you to climb out from under your hangover.
Let's see.
Where did I file your mail?
Oh, yes.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
How's your daddy?
He's fine.
Mrs. Brady's lucky to have a big, strong, virile man like that.
Tell you what, sweetie.
Next Christmas, you tell you daddy
I'd be more than happy to wrap his package.
Okay.
Here.
Hit the road, bad seed.
Excuse me, but the juice will make your shoes slip.
What?
Your shoes'll slip in the juice.
Oh.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Daddy, Mrs. Dittmeyer said that she'd be glad to wrap your package this Christmas.
Hmm... really?
How is Mrs. Dittmeyer?
Mr. Dittmeyer says she's overhung.
But he's not in a good mood because she's taking it in the rear.
Must be that paperboy again.
Cindy, that's Mr. Dittmeyer's business.
Remember, nobody likes a snitch.
I'm not a snitch.
I just tell it like it is.
You know, Cindy, when you tattle on someone, you're not just telling on them.
You're telling on yourself.
And, by tattling on someone, you're really just telling them,
"I'm a tattletale."
Now, is that the tale you want to tell?
I never thought of it like that.
Sweetheart, it's time to get your school things together, honey.
Okay, Mommy.
Hmm...
What is it, Mike?
It's a letter from the county.
They say we haven't paid our property taxes.
Haven't paid our taxes?
We always pay our taxes.
Well, they say it's the fifth notice and we owe them $20,000 by the end of the week or they'll auction our house.
$20,000?
!
There has to be a mix-up.
Well, we better call someone.
We are?
You do?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I see.
We should?
!
You are?
!
Uh-huh.
All right.
Good-bye.
We owe them.
Oh, Mike.
Well, don't you worry, honey.
We'll find the money.
Find the money?
But we used our savings to go to the Grand Canyon and Hawaii.
What are we going to do, Mike?
Okay, troops... time for school!
Greg!
Marcia!
Peter!
Jan!
Bobby!
Cindy!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Do we always have to walk so close?
Oh, Jan.
Uh...
Mom, can I borrow your car today?
I want to ask Donna Leonard to go out for a soda after school.
All right, but no hot-rodding.
Thanks, Mom.
She's the most far-out chick in my class.
You wouldn't believe how much I dig her.
Sure, I would.
I've been digging Sam so long, by the time he proposes,
I'll be six feet under.
Oh, Alice, what would we do without you?
Probably eat out.
Hey, why the long face, Bobby?
Well, ever since I became a safety monitor at school... nobody will talk to me.
They think I'm some kind of fink.
Bobby, people like to be corrected when they're doing something wrong.
That's how we improve ourselves.
Right, Dad.
And, if your sister would wear her glasses, she just might improve her eyesight.
Marcia doesn't have to wear glasses.
Besides, all my friends at school say glasses make me look positively goofy.
Now, honey, you look very lovely with your glasses on.
Doesn't she, kids?
Far out, Jan. Yeah.
Yeah.
You look great.
Yeah, I mean it.
Outtasight.
All right, troops, off to school.
Good-bye.
Have a good day.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Dad.
Bye, Mom.
Come on, Marcia.
I'm coming.
Jan, a real friend likes you for who you are, not what's on your face.
If you judge your friends for passing judgment on you, you're not only judging yourself you're judging your friends for judging you.
And that would be using bad judgment.
I never thought of it that way.
Jan?
Oh.
Bye.
Bye, honey.
Bye, Bobby.
Bye, Jan.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Stupid little punk kid, stay out of the road!
Davy Jones is the most.
I sure wish he'd write back.
I wrote him over a month ago.
But, Marcia, he gets millions of letters.
But I'm president of his fan club and I invited him to entertain at the school dance.
A big rock star like that can't just drop everything for our dance.
Geez, you can be so silly sometimes.
Everybody out.
This is a carjack.
Well, of course this is a car.
But my name's not Jack...
it's Greg.
And this is my sister Marcia.
Hi.
And you are?
Eddie.
Wait a minute.
Didn't you hear me?
Get out now!
This is a carjacking.
Greg, I think he has a flat tire.
He must need a jack.
Sorry, Eddie.
We don't have a jack.
But don't worry.
I'll call AAA as soon as we get to school.
It was so nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.
Hey, you moron!
Out of the way, jerk!
Now, don't worry about the house, honey.
I'm sure Mr. Phillips will advance me the money.
Oh, of course he will.
You're the best player on his team.
Mmm.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Tiger...
Tiger...
Whatever happened to that dog?
Ha!
Brady.
Morning, Larry.
You know, I was just reading about some beautiful property available up in Utah.
I'll bet you'd feel right at home there.
Blue skies, clean living, Osmonds.
Thanks, Larry, but I'm still not interested in moving.
I love this house.
Carol loves it, the kids love it, Alice loves it.
It was our first house all together.
Half a mil...
take it or leave it.
Like I said, there's nothing that could get us to sell.
I designed this house myself.
It's in perfect condition.
Carol thinks so, the kids think so, Alice thinks so.
Sorry.
Well, you can't blame a guy for trying, huh?
Putz.
Uh... excuse me, Mr. Dittmeyer... but, as a member of the safety patrol,
I must warn you that your hedge is overgrown and can block the view of the street for oncoming traffic.
I know this because I was on my bike and checked out the sight lines myself.
Hmm.
Well, you see, Billy...
Bobby.
Like it matters.
I grew my hedge tall for a reason.
So I wouldn't have to see your family.
Thank you for your concern.
Loco!
Loco!
You are standing too close to the vehicle.
¶ I've seen the future, and this is... ¶
¶ ...warmer, girl ¶
¶ Making the music softer... ¶
See you later.
Hey, there, groovy chick.
Oh, great.
Do I look like a yellow, fuzzy baby bird to you?
Hey, that's funny, Donna.
You know, you are really happening in a far-out way.
How about you and me going out for a soda after school?
Sorry.
I got a step class.
If you're having problems with your steps maybe you should let me carry your books to history class.
I can hold my own books, and it's not history... it's "herstory."
Wow.
Hi, everybody.
¶ A goddess on a mountaintop ¶
¶ Was burnin' like a silver flame... ¶
Hey, Marcia.
Hello, Doug Simpson.
¶ And Venus was her name... ¶
God, she drives me crazy!
I got to have that.
I live next door to her.
And she's harder to get into than a Pearl Jam concert.
What are you guys talking about?
Just how twisted the Bradys are.
Especially Marcia.
What a retro-wannabe.
I think Peter's a babe.
Well, in a Gilligan sort of way.
What, are you nuts?
Biology.
Take notes.
What?
¶ Wow!
¶
¶ She's got it ¶
¶ Yeah, baby, she's got it... ¶
Hi, Marcia.
Hi.
Oh, guess what?
My mom said I can sleep over.
Oh, really?
That's great, Noreen.
Guess what else.
Doug just said hi to me.
He is so dreamy, isn't he?
Yeah, I guess.
If you like that sort of thing.
So, can I carry your books to class?
Sure, Noreen.
After all, you are my best friend.
Uh-oh.
Here comes Doug.
Go away.
Sure.
No, no.
Stay.
Okay.
No, no.
Leave.
Fine.
No, no.
Stay.
And pretend I just said something really funny.
What?
Oh.
Hi, Marcia.
What's up?
Oh.
Um... hi, Doug.
Listen, I was just wondering, if you're not doing anything.
Friday night, maybe you'd like to go to the dance with me.
Sure.
That would be a blast.
Cool.
You'll hear from me.
Great.
He's so outtasight.
Oh, my gosh!
I just remembered.
What?
I already told Charlie
I would go to the dance with him.
So?
So I can't go out with two boys at once.
I like Charlie, but Doug is so cute.
And, after all, he is the big man on campus.
Noreen, what am I going to do?
This is the worst mess I've ever gotten myself into.
The worst!
Oh...
My life is over!
So, that is what males experience during the onset of puberty.
Now, as far as the young women are concerned...
First, we begin with ovulation and its effect on the female body.
Peter?
Yes, Miss Lynley?
Why don't you come up here and take the pointer...
and we will trace the path of the ovum through the fallopian tube, where the uterine lining is flushed through the vagina.
Ohh...
Oh!
Peter!
Peter!
So, Jan, what can I help you with?
Teen pregnancy?
Bulimia?
Suicidal tendencies?
No.
It's my stupid glasses.
Oh.
I know I should wear them.
I look at myself in the mirror every morning and I say to myself, "Jan, put on your glasses."
But then I say, "You look like a super creep.
Take them off."
It's like my head tells me to do different things and I get very confused.
Inner voices?
Good.
That's good.
Let's explore that.
What does she mean, "inner voices"?
I don't think that's any of her business.
But it's her job to ask questions.
You are so dumb.
I don't have "inner voices."
Now, Jan, paranoid schizophrenia is very common amongst children of blended families.
You are the middle child, aren't you?
Middle child?
Don't you mean Marcia Brady's little sister?
Wait a minute.
She's just trying to help.
Help?
Wake up!
She's just looking for an excuse to bring up Marcia.
Marcia!
Marcia!
Marcia!
Yes!
I'm in the middle!
Well, it sounds like you have a serious case of...
"middle child syndrome."
But you needn't worry.
Here's a copy of my book... and my tapes.
In the meantime, do something to make yourself stand out... give you your own look... apart from your siblings.
A new look.
That's it.
Gee, thanks, Mrs. Cummings.
Jan, come back when you're pregnant.
And, girl, you better work.
¶ Work it down ¶
¶ Do your thing... ¶
There ain't no justice!
Hi, Holly.
Hi.
Can I give you a hand?
Yeah.
Thanks.
I'm over here.
Hey...
Petey.
Look, Leon.
It's Holly's little friend.
Hey, knock it off or I'll...
Or you'll what?
Dittmeyer!
Do it and die.
I'm going to get you, Brady.
A $20,000 advance?
I'd like to, Mike, but we're still hurting from the recession.
I only have three developers coming all this week.
Let me have a shot at those projects, Mr. Phillips.
If I can sell one of them my design you could front me the advance, right?
Sure, but...
How should I put this delicately, Mike?
Your designs are from another time.
That's kind of you to say, Mr. Phillips.
I've always thought of my style as "classic," as well.
I'll get right to work.
Well, Mr. Amir, what do you think?
I love it.
But it's too... interesting.
I want something simple.
A couple of self-serve pump and a Slurpee machine.
Sorry.
It's only strike one, Mr. Phillips.
I've still got two more times at bat.
Cinderella, dressed in yellow, went to the ball to kiss the fellow.
Hey, Heidi, go yodel in your own yard, huh?
Okay, Mr. Dittmeyer.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey, little girl!
I got to get something out of my truck.
Don't let anybody touch this wire.
Can you do that?
Of course.
Daddy, there's a Brady in our yard!
I thought I told you to stay in your own yard.
Yes.
But you see, Mr. Dittmeyer, I'm simply standing here...
You know, the lisp thing is really getting old.
So why don't you hop back on the Swiss Miss package where you belong, huh?
Okay.
Oh.
Don't forget your jump rope.
Ohh...
Try it and you're Spam.
Well, Mr. Brady, did you hit a home run today?
My design didn't even make it to first base.
You know, maybe we should think about taking Mr. Dittmeyer up on his offer.
You're serious about selling the house?
Carol, I designed this house myself... every color, every brick, every sheet of Formica.
If I knew another way out, I'd take it.
But where else are we going to find
$20,000 by the end of the week?
Oh, no.
We're going to have to sell our house.
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ Beanstalks never grew ¶
¶ No one ever loved... ¶
What is it, Cindy?
I'm busy writing a song for Danielle.
I have to tell you something.
Okay.
But I can't tell you, 'cause that would be tattling.
Come on, Cindy.
If it's important, it's not tattling.
I'm never going to tell that Mom and Dad have to sell the house because they owe
$20,000.
Oops.
And that's why I called this meeting.
Greg, what are we going to do?
Yeah.
If we don't raise $20,000 in one week, we'll have to move.
And go to a new school.
And make new friends.
But, Jan, you don't have any friends.
Wait.
We can save the house.
We can raise the money ourselves.
But how?
Well, we can each get jobs and earn extra money.
Hey, neato idea.
Gee, there are so many things I'm good at.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Oh, I'm just so perfect at so many things.
You're just jealous, Jan.
I'm going to make some serious cash.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I bet I can make more than you.
With what, shrimpo?
Your tooth fairy money?
Who are you calling "shrimpo"?
Hey, Mom always said don't play ball in the house.
Hey, you guys, stop fighting!
If we're going to save this house for Mom and Dad, we've each got to make as much as we can.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, Jan, you don't have any friends.
You're just jealous, Jan.
Jan!
What are you doing?
Go back to sleep, Cindy.
Jan, don't!
Marcia's hair is so beautiful.
Exactly.
That's why
I'm going to get a lot of money when I sell it.
Jan, what are you doing?
Oh, Marcia.
I love your hair.
Ooh!
What a groovy hairdo.
Oh, you're so beautiful!
No!
She's supposed to look bad.
No!
Nooooo!
What a horrible dream.
Greg, have you gone bananas?
No.
I just found a way to save our house.
I'm going to become a rock star.
That's great, Greg, but I need some advice about something really important.
See, Charlie asked me to the dance and I said yes.
Then Doug asked me, and I said yes to him, too.
What am I going to do?
Well, you just tell the guy you don't want to go with that something suddenly came up.
And that works?
Sure.
Girls say it to me all the time.
Hey, Marcia.
Oh, hi, Charlie.
I can't wait until the dance Friday night.
Oh.
Um... about the dance, Charlie... well, something suddenly came up.
Oh.
Oh, well, you know, that's okay.
Maybe some other time?
Sure.
Bye.
Bye.
Greg was right.
Well, that takes care of that problem.
Let's see what's next.
Hmm.
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ Beanstalks never grew... ¶
"Attention!
"Missing school office supplies.
Reward offered."
Office supplies?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah.
I heard it before.
You know, I've got reward money riding on this.
Now, spread 'em.
Oh, come on, Mrs. Whitfield!
You're going to have to do better than that!
Boy, you sure have some strong thigh muscles, Mrs. Whitfield.
But I've been here for hours!
Please!
You won't regret it!
I guarantee it!
Please.
Weren't you ever a kid with a dream of making something of yourself?
"Clowns"?
"Beanstalks"?
What the hell is this?
This is a guaranteed gold record!
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ And beanstalks... ¶
No.
Look, what did you say your name was again?
Bravo...
Johnny Bravo.
Listen...
"Bravo..."
today's sound is raw, with an edge.
Seattle... grunge...
garage bands...
Don't they have beanstalks in Seattle?
Well, hey, there, groovy chick.
Mmm... uh-uh.
Yeah.
It went fabulous.
Put the head back on, Fletcher.
Listen, I am closing in on the, uh... on the Bradys, though.
Can I call you back, Mr. Feldman?
My car phone's ringing.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm calling from a marketing firm.
We'd just like a few minutes of your time...
Ow!
Do you ever use pens and pencils?
I know you do...
Oh, hi, Mrs. Dittmeyer!
I'm here to see Eric.
Oh, hi, Greggie.
Oh, Greg...
I'm so glad you're here.
I've got some more of your mail.
Oh.
Oh, gee, your hands are full.
Let me just...
My, you've... gotten so big.
You're almost as big as your daddy.
And I'm still growing.
Right... before my very eyes.
Your pants are... so tight.
Hey, Mrs. Dittmeyer.
Peter!
Can I mow your lawn?
I'm trying to earn some extra money.
Sure.
Two Bradys...
Tell you what...
when you boys are done, why don't you come inside and help me make a sandwich?
Penny for your thoughts.
How about 20,000 of them?
You're worried about the house, aren't you?
I told you I'd take care of everything.
Oh, Mike, it's just that we're so happy here.
I sure would miss our kitchen and our garden... and Alice!
If we lose her, who'll make the lunches I pass out?
And who'll answer the phone:
"Brady residence."
And who'll help me...
Honey, Alice isn't going anywhere, and neither are we.
Besides, she doesn't do everything around her.
Time to put your bookmark in, Mr. Brady.
I sure am glad your mom let you sleep over on a school night.
Marcia, I have to tell you something.
Hmm?
You are the prettiest girl in the entire school.
I know.
But how can I use my good looks and sparkling personality to make money and save our house?
That's it!
I could be a teen model!
Oh, thanks, Noreen!
You're the greatest!
Oh...
Noreen?
Hmm?
Is that you?
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought that was my leg.
Oh...
Night.
Sweet dreams, Marcia.
I still don't know why you had to tag along.
This is my thing.
You're not the only one who can be a model, you know.
Ooh... those are pretty pictures.
What have you modeled for?
Guess.
Um... are you a Breck girl?
No. "Guess" jeans.
Okay, um...
Levis...
Wrangler...
Oshkosh B'Gosh?
Brady girls?
That's us.
So... you're professional models?
Yes, we are!
Of course!
So, what do you have to show me?
Plenty.
Oh...
Why don't we take five?
You.
Wow...
Thank you!
Why does everyone always choose Marcia?
!
What does she have that I don't have?
!
Now, Marcia, I may be able to use you, but first, you're going to have to do a little work on yourself.
You mean like walking with a book on my head?
No.
I mean like cutting that mousy hair, capping those teeth and losing about 30 pounds, my little sausage.
How do you feel about breast implants?
Cut my hair?
!
And, after much consideration, Mr. Swanson,
I designed a structure especially for your needs.
So, what do you think?
Well, it's just too good a design for a fast food joint.
You see what I'm saying, Phillips?
This is...
I think you're pumping a dry well here.
You understand what I'm saying?
All right.
I'll be in touch with you.
Sorry, Mikey.
Well... strike two.
There's got to be a way to make $20,000.
Hey!
"Search for the Stars is looking
"for fresh young musical acts.
First prize: $20,000."
Hmm...
Too bad I'm not a musical act.
Hey, Marcia!
I'm not Marcia!
I'm Jan!
The usual, Sam.
Sure thing, Mrs. Brady.
20 pounds of ground round coming right up.
Carol, are you still eating red meat?
Why, of course!
I've got growing kids!
I have to think about their health!
Isn't Sam the best?
We're sure going to miss this place when we move, won't we?
Oh, we're not moving.
You're not?
I thought everyone on the block was.
Mike says there's no reason to sell.
We'll be here forever.
There you go, Mrs. Brady.
Thanks, Sam.
Have a nice day.
Bye, Sam.
Bye.
Marcia, could you call the troops to dinner?
In a second.
I'm just checking for a letter from Davy Jones.
Nothing.
Oh, Alice, if I don't get an answer from him soon,
I'll be the most humiliated girl in the world.
You think waiting three weeks for an answer is rough?
Try waiting 20 years for the question.
Alice.
Hey, Greg, you're the Casanova of Clinton Avenue.
How can I get Holly to go for me?
Well, chicks love compliments, man.
Just tell her how groovy she is.
And that really works?
Trust me.
It always gets a reaction.
Now, throw me a pass.
24, 32, set, hike.
Dinner's ready...
Ooh, my nose!
Are you all right?
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Marcia.
Yeah, me, too.
Let's have a look, Marcia.
I look awful, just awful.
I can never show my face in school again.
I'm ruined.
Sweetheart, I know you feel terrible, but it's going to get better.
I'm sure no one will ever notice.
Oh, my goodness.
What happened to your...?
Mother's favorite picture?
It's crooked.
I mean the painting's crooked.
I think I'd better go.
I think I hear the nose boy.
I mean the newsboy.
Oh, boy, did I blow it.
Now I'll never be a teen model.
I'll never be anything.
What's the point of living?
I might as well die.
Don't forget my $10 reward money.
I made more than you... almost $12.
Well, I got $15 from Mrs. Dittmeyer.
Boy, is she a good tipper.
But we're still nowhere near $20,000.
This is just awful.
You can say that again.
Tonight's the school dance and my nose still hasn't gone down.
Hey, I saw something on the bulletin board at school about a "Search for the Stars" contest.
They're looking for fresh, young musical groups.
First prize is exactly $20,000.
Oh, sure, Jan, like we'd really win.
Oh, Jan...
We'd never have a chance of winning.
We might as well rob a bank.
Guys, there's no point in fighting.
We're running out of time, and we still have to find a way out of this mess.
I sure am going to miss this house.
Uh-oh.
Here comes Mom and Dad.
All right, now, remember, everyone, act happy.
We can't let on that we know anything.
Mike, you don't think the kids suspect anything, do you?
Oh, no, of course not.
Well, just to make sure, we should act extra happy.
Well, you know what makes us the happiest.
Potato sack race!
Get ready... get set... go!
So, what can I do you for?
You can explain to me what Mrs. Brady told my wife.
Yeah, if Mike Brady won't sell, we're all screwed.
Well, allow me to take this opportunity to set the record straight.
The Bradys are selling, my clients are buying and you are all making out like bandits.
Scotch, Steve?
Are you calling my wife a liar?
Steve, no.
I'm just saying you can't believe the Bradys.
You've all seen the insane stuff that goes on over there.
How about this Astroturf lawn they treat like real grass, huh?
And, excuse me... the family that's happy all the time?
Not possible.
It is strange how they spend their weekends... hopping around in potato sacks.
And you know something?
Yeah.
I hear that their maid works for free.
Can you understand that?
No.
I can't.
No.
You know, I was over there once.
One bathroom for nine people?
Get out of here.
Oh, stop, please.
And I never did see a toilet.
Please, they've got to put it somewhere.
Come on.
I rest my case.
Hi.
I'm Doug Simpson.
Marcia's date?
Oh, right...
the big man on campus.
Come on in, Doug.
Marcia, Doug's here!
Hi, Doug.
Big man on campus, huh?
Yeah, right.
Hi, Doug.
Hi, Marcia.
Is anything wrong?
Sweetheart, I think you better show him.
I suppose you don't want to go out with me now, huh?
Oh, of course I do.
It's not your nose I'm after.
That's a fine boy.
Marcia's got there.
Oh, Marcia, it looks like rain.
You better take your shawl.
Thanks.
Uh, Doug, how about you?
Do you have any protection?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Assorted colors and textures.
Good for you.
Have fun, kids.
Bye-bye.
¶ Are you coming with me?
¶
But, Doug, this isn't the school dance.
I just figured we'd come up here and unwind a little bit before we go down.
Mind if I change the station?
Oh, it is windy tonight.
Maybe we should put the top up.
I'll keep you warm, Marcia.
Uh...
Doug, your hand is on my shoulder.
So?
Well, that's third base, and I don't go that far.
Doug, I think I just felt your tongue in my mouth.
That's called a French kiss, Marcia.
I thought you were from Nebraska.
I am.
Listen, Doug, I don't know what you were thinking, but I don't do things like that.
You may live your life one way, but we Bradys follow our own drummer.
So, I hope this doesn't sour the rest of our date.
You Bradys suck!
Excuse me.
Oh, no, thank you.
I don't take rides from strangers.
I was just wondering how to get to West Dale High School.
West Dale High?
¶ How do you do?
¶
¶ Yeah ¶
¶ So now I'm pissed off ¶
¶ My head is a twist-off ¶
¶ I never have been cute ¶
¶ I need more money 'cause my life is crummy ¶
¶ And get that stuff off my shoe ¶
¶ It is a cruel world, I'm no schoolgirl ¶
¶ I never do what I should ¶
¶ And they never know, it's about to blow... ¶
Hey, you're one groovy chick.
You're really happening in a far-out way.
Thanks.
Peter!
Yeah!
Excuse me.
Can I have your attention, please?
You may all know me as Greg Brady, but tonight, I'd like to introduce you to...
Johnny Bravo!
For my first song,
I'd like to sing a number I wrote for the grooviest chick at West Dale High.
One, two three, four... ¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶
¶ Beanstalks never grew ¶
¶ Ponies never ran before ¶
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
¶ Does it scare you ¶
¶ When you see me lose my mind... ¶
¶ I go crazy... ¶
Hi, everybody.
It's the new Jan Brady.
Am I a hit?
Do you like it?
Hmm.
Wow.
It worked.
I really did make a splash.
Can I have your attention, please?
I have some news that's going to make everyone flip.
Hey... what about me?
I thought he might show up, but I didn't want to get all your hopes up.
Marcia did it again.
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!
But here he is...
Davy Jones!
Hey, Grandpa...
Oh, man!
Thanks a lot for being here, Davy...
I mean, Mr. Jones.
Anything for my number-one fan.
¶ Girl ¶
¶ Look what you've done to me ¶
Look, it really is Davy Jones!
¶ Me ¶
¶ And my whole world ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ You've brought ¶
¶ The sun to me ¶
¶ With your smile ¶
¶ You did it, girl ¶
¶ I'm telling you, girl ¶
¶ Something not ¶
¶ Known to me ¶
¶ Makes ¶
¶ You what you are... ¶
Hi, Charlie.
Hey, Marcia.
It was rude of me to break our date.
How can I make it up to you?
Well, uh... gee, Marcia, how about a dance?
Why, I'd love to, Charlie Anderson.
¶ ...that way, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ For making the morning brighter ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making the nighttime nicer ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making a better world ¶
¶ For me ¶
¶ I'm telling you, girl ¶
¶ Something unknown to me ¶
¶ Makes ¶
¶ You what you are ¶
¶ And what you are ¶
¶ Is all that I want for me ¶
¶ And it's good ¶
¶ To feel that way, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ For making the winter warmer ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making the music softer ¶
¶ Girl ¶
¶ For making a better world for me ¶
¶ And what you are ¶
¶ Is all that I want for me ¶
¶ And it's good ¶
¶ To feel that way, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl ¶
¶ Thank you, girl... ¶
Hey, where are you going?
Something suddenly came up.
Hey, Marcia, you looked great up there.
Thanks, Noreen.
Hey, Marcia, you got a sec?
Forget it, Doug.
Even with a swollen nose,
I can still smell a rat.
Slut.
Um...
Marcia, would you get our coats.
I have a little, uh...
matter to discuss.
Sure, Charlie.
Hey...
I heard what you said, Doug... and I'm not going to let you talk to Marcia like that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, what are you going to do about it, geek?
I-I'm going to...
lose... consciousness.
Hey, Doug.
How's about a little punch?
Is he dead?
Wow.
Charlie, thanks.
Couldn't have done it better myself.
Here.
Are you okay?
I really had a great time, Marcia.
Yeah, me, too, Charlie.
Well, uh...
Bye.
Bye.
Uh, Marcia?
So, um... can, uh... can I have a kiss good night?
Yeah.
Okay, Charlie.
Marcia...
I think I just felt your tongue in my mouth.
It's called a French kiss, Charlie.
Um...
Marcia, I got to go.
Uh, something suddenly came up.
32, 24, hike.
Dinner's ready.
Oh, my nose!
What a nice dream.
Jan, what is it?
Has my nose gotten worse?
No.
It's better.
The hardest thing about the health club business is getting people to leave their house.
Well... what do you think?
I love it.
Consider yourself hired.
Uh-huh.
You would?
I see.
Ahh.
All right.
Mom, Dad?
Hey, why the gloom?
Well, we just had a kid meeting and, well, we decided that we don't mind if we have to move.
We tried to raise the money for the tax bill ourselves, but there are only two days left and all we could come up with was $110.
What?
How did you know about the house and the tax bill?
Oops!
Cindy, do I have to remind you that when you tattle on somebody, you're not just telling on them, you're telling on yourself and...
Telling them that you're a tattletale.
We've heard it, Dad.
Thanks.
Kids, you have nothing to worry about.
Today your father sold a design and now he can get that $20,000 advance.
I appreciate what you all tried to do and from now on, no more secrets.
The important thing is we still have our home so, let's celebrate.
Put on your Sunday best, kids.
We're going to Sears.

"Joint consolidated tax bill:
Final notice."
"Dear Mr. Brady...
"due to your failure to pay... house will be auctioned 2:00 p.m. tomorrow..."
$20,000.
Dina?
Dina... this is the greatest day of our lives.
Did the kids run away?
No.
We are rich.
We are going to be filthy, stinking, disgustingly rich.
Larry?
Yeah?
Get me my ice mask.
Forget your ice mask.
We're going to be so rich you can hire an Eskimo to sit on your face.
It's open.
Of course it is.
Morning.
Morning, Larry.
If you're here about the offer, the answer's still no.
I haven't changed my mind.
No need for that.
I know you won't be selling this house because, after the auction tomorrow at 2:00, I'll own it.
Well, I don't think there'll be any auction.
What?
Well, luckily, I just sold one of my designs, so it looks like the Bradys are here to stay.
So, which firm was lucky enough to snag one of your designs, Mike?
And, of course if you ever need a property for one of your health clubs
I'm your man.
Oh, thank you.
Well, well.
What have we here?
This is one of our new gyms that we're constructing.
We are negotiating to buy the design right now.
Really?
Who's your architect?
A very talented fellow... name of Brady.
I guess you won't be breaking ground until after he dries out.
Dries out?
I really shouldn't say anything.
Guy's been through a lot lately, what with the charges filed against him and everything.
Charges?
Criminal negligence.
A building he designed completely collapsed.
Old folks home, Christmas day.
All those cute, little visiting grandchildren... some with puppies.
Let's take a moment to honor their memory, shall we?
I'll get it.
Brady residence.
You did?
I see.
When?
Uh-huh.
They did?
Why not?
Uh-huh... oh.
Yeah?
Right.
Well... bye.
Bad news, I'm afraid.
Oh, Mike.
What?
The Flex factory pulled out of the project this morning.
They're not going with my design.
Oh, Mike.
Why?
Well, they wouldn't say.
I guess this means it's over.
Unless a miracle happens by 2:00 tomorrow, the county is going to auction our house.
Oh, Mike.
How?
Kids, I'm afraid the money that we were counting on is no longer a possibility.
But I want you to remember that no matter where we go, or whatever house we're in, we'll be fine as long as we're together, so I don't want to see any more frowns.
We're Bradys.
And as a wise man once said:
"Wherever you go, there you are."
I never thought of it that way, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
Boy, this is crummy.
Well, there must be some way out of this mess.
Everybody think.
Hey, I've got it.
We can enter that "Search for the Stars" contest.
First prize is exactly $20,000.
Hey, that's a nifty idea, Marcia.
Great idea, Marcia.
Good idea, Marcia.
Am I invisible?
Do I not have a voice?
I had that idea two days ago.
Stop being so selfish, Jan.
Come on, Jan.
Oh, Jan.
Jan. Jan.
Come on, you guys, we got a big day ahead of us.
We better get some rest if we're going to be a fresh, young musical group.
It was my idea.
Mine.
Didn't anybody hear me?
I heard you.
Me, too, but it sounded better coming from Marcia.
Sam, that was the juiciest Meat Cutters' Ball
I've ever been to.
I'm cooked.
Alice, I want you to stick out your hand and close your eyes.
I got a surprise for you.
Unless it fits on my finger, I've got to hit the sack.
It better fit, or I'm going to have to take it back.
Sam, I thought this day would never come.
When I saw it,
I thought it was right up your alley.
I'm bowled over.
I always thought our grandchildren would come visit us in this house.
Oh, Mike.
You know, this is going to be our last night in this bedroom.
Why, Grandpa Brady.
Jan, where are you going?
Someplace where I can be appreciated.
Go ahead and snitch if you want.
Just give me a head start.
I wouldn't snitch.
But how will we sing without you?
Why don't you ask Marcia?
Maybe she has another brilliant idea.
Mom?
Dad?
Uh... what is it, Cindy?
If you know something, but you don't want to be a tattle, but it's very important that you tell someone...
Cindy, let's talk about it tomorrow.
But Jan could be dead by then!
What?
!
Oops!
Why would Jan run away like this?
Maybe we were thinking too much about our problems and not enough about the kids.
Did anyone say anything that would make Jan run away?
Nothing more than what we usually say to her.
Yeah.
I'll get Alice.
Oh.
Hi, folks.
Sam, what are you doing here?
Oh, I was just, um, delivering some meat.
Well, it's a good thing you're here.
Jan ran away, and we need you and Alice to help find her.
We'll circle the block.
You check the school.
Come on, gang, let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, everybody, hurry up.
Come on.
Come on, Cindy.
I call the way back.
I got the backseat.
What happened?
Did an animal die on your head?
Hey, lose the hat.
You'll be okay.
Keep your eyes peeled, everybody.
Breaker, one-nine, breaker, one-nine, this is Christmas Carol.
Honey, no one's answered us in years.
Oh, Mike, I have to try.
Breaker, one-nine, do you read me?
Anyone out there?
I need a 20 on a little girl.
Blond, blue-eyed, answers to the name of Jan.
Tell her...
Mother Hen and Father Goose love her very much.
Come after me if you're out there, over.
Huh.
Sounds like some family misses somebody they love very much.
I don't have a family.
Oh, no family.
You know, sometimes
I'm driving the graveyard shift in the middle of nowhere,
I can't help thinking what might have been if I'd taken a different road... married young, had a family... three boys, three girls.
Oh, then a little voice says, "Are you kidding?
They'd probably just treat you like a maid."
Do you want some of this, Jan?
No, thanks.
You have a little voice, too?
Mmm.
Oh, honey, when you're on the road as long as I am, you got to talk to somebody.
That's a trick I learned growing up.
It's tough being a middle child.
You're a middle child.
So am I.
Then you know what it feels like not being special.
What does she mean, "I'm not special?"
Hey, she's just trying to help.
My family's not much.
No kids, though we do have a lot of livestock.
Jan!
Oh, Jan!
Don't listen to her!
In this day and age, if you're lucky enough...
Who is that?
It's me... the new Jan Brady.
Let's knock over a 7-Eleven.
Stop!
You're scaring me!
Me, too.
Me, too!
Mom?
Dad?
Hi.
I'm back.
Marcia?
Cindy?
Are you up there?
Greg?
Peter?
Bobby?
Alice?
Sam?
Christmas Carol, this is Schultzy, come back to me.
Schultzy!
Th-this is Christmas Carol.
I got a 20 on a little girl.
Blue eyes, blonde hair, answers to the name of Jan.
I just dropped her off at 4222 Clinton Way.
Thank you, Schultzy, thank you and God bless!
Over.
That's a big ten-four.
Jan?
Jan, are you here?
Mom?
Dad?
Oh, honey!
Oh, honey!
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm so glad you're safe!
Oh, honey, what on earth made you run away?
I thought no one wanted me here anymore, but when I was out in the real world,
I realized that I wanted me to be here.
You're all a part of me and I'm a part of you, and there's no escaping that... but it makes me feel really special.
I couldn't have put it better myself, Jan, but I'll try anyway.
See, I've always believed that it doesn't matter where your home is, because home is where your heart is, and we may lose this house, but we'll always have our family because we're Bradys,
and this family is our home.
That's why we'll always have our home.
As long as we have our family, even if we lose our house, we're still Bradys.
Your father's right.
Oh, yeah, absolutely, Dad.
Maybe we can still save the house.
How about Jan's idea of the "Search for the Stars" contest?
Jan's idea?
Yes, it was Jan's, and it's a really great plan.
What's "Search for the Stars?"
It's a contest for the best musical group, and there's a first prize of $20,000.
And singing one of Greg's songs, we're sure to win.
Well, then, you're going to have to sing it without me.
Huh?
What?
Why?
I thought I could change my name and my personality and become some big, flashy rock star, but I was just kidding myself.
Nobody liked my act.
I guess I just don't have what it takes.
Well, let's face it,
Johnny Bravo's nothing but...
Johnny Rotten.
You're right, son.
Johnny Bravo doesn't have what it takes... but Greg Brady does.
He has us, and this family can accomplish anything.
Alone, we can only move buckets, but if we work together, we can drain rivers.
Your father's right.
The eight of us separate are just eight... well, with Alice, we're nine, but nine...
Yes, well, technically...
And with Sam, ten, but ten separate, just ten.
Together... we're a Bunch.
Yeah.
The Brady Bunch.
What do you say, Greg?
Please?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Grab some costumes.
We've got to make that contest!
Okay!
All right!

I'm so nervous.

Stop it.
You're making me nervous.
All right, let's have a big hand for Phlegm.
Yay!
You sounded hot.
What, are you...
completely brain-dead?
Leon missed an entire riff.
Didn't you hear it?
I liked it.
You're such a loser.
Hey, Eric.
I'm sick and tired of seeing you treat Holly that way.
In fact...
I'm sick and tired of you altogether.
You're nothing but a... a big bully.
You're dog meat, Brady.
Do it... and die, Eric.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh.
Hurry, Peter.
We're on.
Thanks, Peter.
I think you're really... neato.
- Oh, yes.
- I hope everybody's having a good time.
Why, uh... thank you, Holly.
I think you're...
Ginger and Mary Ann combined.
Come on, Peter.
That's us.
See ya.
Good luck.

Thank you, Brady Bunch.
You were great.
Great.
Give the rest of our contestants a big hand as our judges tally up the scores.
Thank you.
And I have it right here.
The winner of the Search for the Stars $20,000 grand prize is... the Brady Bunch?
Hey, great job.
Thanks.
They what?
!
How could those losers win anything?
Look, Eric, you got to stall them for me.
What do you mean, what's in it for you?
All right, you have my permission to pierce anything you want.
Just keep them from getting here.
Damn kid.
Come on.
Well, here it is.
A check made out to the Brady Bunch for $20,000.
Come on, gang, let's go.
Hurry!
All right, everybody.
Let's hear it for them Bradys.
They were something else.
Thanks for coming down.
I hope you had a good time and we'll see you...
Come on, come on.
Let's go, troops!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Hey, there, groovy chicks.
You're all happening in far out ways.
Greg, hurry.
The house.
Now, how do you suppose that happened?
Oh, Mike.
What are we going to do?
Hey, Marcia, look.
It's our friend, Eddie.
You remember.
The guy who needed a car jack.
Come on, everybody.
He can give us a lift.
Hey, Eddie!
Oh, no.
Can you give us a ride?
A ride?
Good afternoon.
Having trouble with the car alarm?
No.
It's not our car.
It's our friend Eddie's.
Oh, really?
Where are the keys, Eddie?
I lost them.
Oh, no.
But we were counting on you to give us a ride to our house.
I'll run the plate.
Uh, excuse me, Officer but I'd hate to ask a law enforcement official to bend the rules... especially for penal code 117 section 33-B, but our house is at stake.
Please?
2:00.
Auction time.
It's exciting, isn't it, Alice?
By the power authorized me by the county of Los Angeles,
I hereby offer this property to the highest bidder, unless the owner redeems...
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'll start the bidding at the sum total of back taxes: $20,000.
Do I have any takers?
Say...
I've got $20,000.
Stop the auction!
We have the money for the tax bill.
I repeat, stop the auction.
We have the money for the tax bill.
The house is still ours.
Come on, kids.
Hold everything.
Good news, everybody.
The Bradys are here to stay.
You lied to us, Dittmeyer.
The Bradys aren't selling.
I knew it!
You guaranteed us!
You ruined us, Dittmeyer.
You're going to pay for this.
Now, hold on, people.
Wait a minute.
The man you should be angry with is me, 'cause our house is more important than money.
This neighborhood is more important than money.
Tell me, how many times have we borrowed each other's power tools or patched up each other's kids?
We know so much about each other.
I know that every January, Mr. Yeager's going to have that big Super Bowl party at his house.
Yeah.
We know every spring Mrs. Simmons is going to have the prettiest daffodils on the block.
They are beautiful.
They are lovely flowers.
We know that at 10:15 every Saturday morning,
Mrs. Topping likes to walk through her living room naked.
You knew about that?
Call me old-fashioned, but these things are important and they're not for sale.
This is our neighborhood... and we're staying.
Now, this is going to sound crazy... but Brady's right.
We're never going to find another neighborhood like this.
And we'll never find neighbors like the Bradys.
We're staying, too.
Us, too.
So are we.
We will, too.
Great.
Gosh, I wish I lived here.
I mean, it's... it's incredible.
You people are all staying... because one family is willing to stand up for what they believe in?
Well... that and the huge settlement we're going to get after we sue Dittmeyer's ass.
Oh, Mike.
I always knew you could hit a grand slam and now we can stay in our house after all.
Hey, do you know who'd love to hear about this?
Grandma!
Hey.
Hi, everybody.
Wait a minute.
Look, how pretty you have gotten.
Oh, those clothes.
Oh, what taste.
And that smile...
Oh, Marcia, you are such a beauty.
Everyone loves Marcia.
No one loves you.
Watch my head spin.
Kill, kill, kill!
No, stop it!
I can't take it anymore!
Aw, shut up, you loser!
Jan!
Cut the crap.
They're gone.
Thank you, Grandma.
Oh, there.
Cindy.
Oh, Cindy.
Why does Jan get all the attention?
Yeah.
It's always Jan, Jan, Jan.

It is a male.
Pharaoh has decreed death for all Hebrew newborn males.
I'll see to it.
It's the best way.
Miriam.
At least they'll die quickly.
Moses.
Ptira, come and get your adopted son.
Teach him to stay on his feet.
Memefta.
My son.
Are you ready, Memefta?
-Moses?
-Ready.
Begin.
Moses!
We greet Pharaoh as we greet the sun.
-Pharaoh is Egypt.
-Egypt is Pharaoh.
We offer praise to you on the commemoration of the day... that the great God Rah gave all Egypt the gift of our Pharaoh, Ramses.
I love birthdays.
Especially my own.
And how does my family mark this special occasion?
We all bring offerings to you, god on earth, the sun that lights our lives.
I offer praise to my father on this great day.
You have done well, my daughter.
And what does your son bring?
Moses, are you here?
I'm here, Your Majesty.
I had a game made for you, Great Egypt.
Speak up, Moses, I can't hear you.
A game.
This is very fine woodwork, Moses.
I didn't know that you were so good with your hands.
No, Great Egypt.
I did not make the game myself.
It was made by a Hebrew craftsman at my request...
-especially for you.
-A Hebrew?
I have never been very skilled at games.
Are you?
-No, Great Egypt.
-Moses is too humble, Great Egypt.
-He defeats me in riddles quite often.
-You let him win, Tuntmin...
-as you do with me.
-Never.
-Are you good at riddles, my son?
-l have one for you, Father.
When is an Egyptian not an Egyptian?
I don't know, my son.
When?
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten the answer, Father.
Then it's not a very good riddle, is it?
I'm sure there are those in the court who know the answer.
When you do know the answer...
-ask it again.
-Yes, Father.
And now my gift for you.
A model of the great statue I'm building in honor of my father...
Great Egypt.
Ramses.
Prepare the chariots.
I wish to see where my son has decreed... that I shall stand through the centuries.
Put that back in the cart!
Here, have some water.
You, work harder!
Get up, they'll see you.
-Just rest here for a moment.
-No.
If they see me lying here, they will beat me.
-Just rest.
-Lazy Hebrew, will it take a beating...
-to make you work?
-No!
-You dare interfere, Hebrew?
-No, leave him !
The Pharaoh himself arrives.
Get to your knees, Hebrew.
The Great Ramses is within sight.
Down on your knees!
On your knees.
-Pharaoh is Egypt!
-Pharaoh is Egypt!
-Egypt is Pharaoh!
-Egypt is Pharaoh!
Back to work.
-Moses, you shouldn't come here.
-You say that every time I come... and every time I come, your eyes tell me what a terrible liar you are.
Please, Moses, they mustn't see me being idle.
They won't bother you.
Get up!
-How are you?
-l am well, Moses.
-And you?
-l want for nothing.
-Except....
-Except?
I have to go.
Expect me tonight.
Goodbye, Moses.
Give him a hand over there.
Come on, hurry!
You're not Hebrew, Moses.
You sucked at the breast of a Hebrew.
Nothing else.
You are an Egyptian prince.
Be proud.
Why?
Because Egyptians are powerful?
No.
Because it's what you are.
I'm not Egyptian, nor Hebrew. I'm nothing.
Don't speak this way, or you shall offend the gods.
Which gods?
The gods that you teach me to worship or the God that Jochabed loves?
Jochabed was your wet nurse, nothing more.
-She lies if she says she was more.
-She tells me nothing more.
-But I know the truth.
-The truth is that I am your mother.
-You are a royal prince of Egypt.
-l'm nothing!
Pharaoh knows it, the court knows it, the nation knows it.
Only you pretend, Mother.
Move along.
Keep moving. I want to get home.
No!
You thought you would get away with it, didn't you?
-No, master, please, I meant no harm !
-You made me look like a fool.
No!
Moses.
You've killed him.
You've killed an Egyptian.
Aaron.
Keep digging, Hur.
It's not deep enough.
Come on, pick up the body.
Cover it with some mud.
-Quickly.
-We have to go.
We must cover him.
Leave him.
You saved my life.
Why?
Why?
You're my brother, Aaron.
God be with you, Moses.
What do you want here?
-l want to see my mother.
-Moses, no.
-You don't belong here.
You're Egyptian.
-Aaron.
-l'm here to see my mother.
-Moses, no.
I'm here, my son.
Mother.
Forgive me, Moses.
It was my only way to save you from the sword of Ramses.
I am Hebrew.
You are whatever you choose to be.
God has given you a choice He has given to no other man.
-But I've taken it away.
-What do you mean?
Why are you wearing these rough clothes?
-l'm leaving Egypt.
-Leaving?
Tonight.
Didn't Aaron tell you?
Aaron?
I have so many questions... but now... I must go.
God saved you, Moses.
Serve him well.
Fill the trough.
Drive the flock forward.
But, Zipporah, Father said not to look for trouble.
He doesn't have to spend half of every day waiting until the men are through.
They have struck us before.
They'll do it again.
Fill the trough.
Come.
See how fortunate we are?
The priest's daughters have filled the trough for our flock.
You are mistaken.
The water is for my father's flock.
Really?
Jethro's sheep can wait.
Perhaps.
But my sisters and I can't.
Drive the flock forward.
Do as I say.
May I drink at your well?
Thank you.
If you would drink, you'd better ask my permission.
Nobody makes a fool of me.
You ignore me at your peril, stranger.
Now there's no point in strutting for the sisters.
-You're one and we are four.
-What's your name, shepherd?
Midan.
What's yours?
Moses, son of Ptira, daughter of Ramses.
-Ramses.
-Look inside my cloak.
My cloak.
-Egyptian.
-lt's Egyptian army.
I serve Ramses himself.
His army can probably be seen from the top of that ridge.
They'll need lambs to eat.
Shall we take your sheep... or those of the women?
Move the sheep.
Quick.
What did you say to him that made him so afraid?
You're shaking, yet you're brave.
Why?
-l was not brave.
-You were brave.
Why?
I was angry.
Sometimes....
He knocked you down.
That was wrong.
My father is Jethro.
He's the priest of Midian.
He'll be grateful.
-l'll be on my way.
-But my father--
No, it's best.
Go well.
You're back soon.
Father!
An Egyptian stopped Midan from taking our place at the trough.
An Egyptian?
Or a gang of them?
-No, Father, just one.
-But a very brave one.
is that him?
He deserves a show of gratitude.
I asked him to stay, Father, but--
Go fetch him, daughter!
My, what great pleasure it is for me to have another man at my table.
My life is surrounded by women.
A father needs a son amongst his family.
As you saw today at the well, we live in a time of rough men... with little respect for women.
I'm a priest to the people of Midian... which lies just beyond the ridge.
What gods do you worship, Moses?
In Egypt, we have many gods.
-The Hebrew slaves have only one.
-Yes.
You know of him?
is He above other gods?
I haven't heard much of his power for many years.
My Hebrew wet nurse... she says that he will deliver them from slavery.
From the Egyptians?
That will be an act of great power.
You're a man of many fascinating thoughts and ideas, Moses.
But not many words.
It would be worth our while to persuade you to stay for a time.
There's no better kitchen in the entire region.
Zipporah makes sure of that.
And no one weaves finer fabric than we do.
-Also under Zipporah's eye.
-They exaggerate, Moses.
I'm sure it's all true, but I must be on my way.
East?
Mostly barren land.
What towns do exist rarely welcome strangers.
Why not stay here... until you have a better idea of where you're headed?
-Yes, please stay.
-Please stay.
-You're very kind, but--
-Good, that's agreed.
A full day has passed since great Pharaoh has shown any sign of mortal spark.
Let Egypt rejoice.
My father has rejoined the gods of the other world.
Give thanks to great Pharaoh.
The sun and moon live in him.
Arise.
Tuntmin, you may look upon me.
Egypt's people shall mourn for one full phase of the moon... while the holy embalmers prepare my father... for his journey to the other world.
As it is said, so shall it be done.
Then I shall take my place on the sun throne.
-As it is said, so shall it be done.
-Good.
Let the mourning begin.
-You counted them?
-l have.
-Every one?
-Every one.
Dried lamb, bread, dates, and the water.
-ls that enough for you?
-lt's two or three days.
I'll see them settled for summer grazing, then I'll return.
-Take care.
-l will.
-Beware of the wolves.
-l will.
Yes, you've lost your mum.
You've lost your mama.
Strange.
No lightning.
Come, let's go and see.
You burn, but the flames don't consume you.
Moses.
Here I am.
Remove your sandals... for the place where you stand is holy ground.
Be at peace.
I am the God of your fathers...
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.
Why do you come to me?
I have heard the cry of my people, Israel.
I will send you to the Pharaoh... and you shall free my people from Egypt.
Why me?
A man clumsy with words.
Who am I to go before the Pharaoh?
I will be with you.
If I go to the Israelites and say that God has sent me... they won't believe me.
They'll ask, "What is his name?"
I am who I am.
They won't listen.
Why should they?
They'll seek signs.
That rod, cast it to the ground.
Grasp it by the tail.
Now put your hand under your cloak.
Now withdraw it.
No.
Now replace your hand... and then withdraw it.
This will be the sign that you speak... with the voice of the Lord their God.
Please.
Lord.
Not me.
I've never been a man of words.
Not in times past, not now.
Even as you speak to me... I'm still... I'm still of speech!
Your brother, Aaron, will meet you... and you will be my voice to him, and he will speak for you to the people.
Jethro!
Moses!
Maybe I was dreaming or mad from the sun.
-Or perhaps God spoke to you.
-Why would God speak to me?
-Why not you?
-Because I don't know God... I know nothing of God!
-ln Egypt they have many gods.
-Which god spoke to you?
The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
-But you're Egyptian.
-No. I'm Hebrew.
I had two mothers.
I came from the womb of Jochabed, a Hebrew slave.
But I was raised up by Ptira, daughter of Ramses himself.
Ramses?
Both mothers... spoke to me of God, but....
l've yet to find my God, I can't find him.
God doesn't speak to anyone.
-He knows your heart.
-Even a murderer?
Does he speak to murderers?
Does he know the heart of a murderer?
What are you saying?
Moses?
In Egypt I killed a man.
It's why I ran. lt's why I came here.
They killed so many of them.
Of us!
And I survive.
And I kill!
I know nothing of this.
But I do know...
God speaks for a purpose...
-and you heard your God's voice.
-Did I?
Are you mad?
No, you're not.
You saw the bush.
You heard the voice.
-God has spoken to you.
-Has he?
Did he not give you a sign?
Did he not change your staff into a serpent...
-as you told us?
-As I told you.
-lt was God.
-Was it?
Was it God?
What could be more real than the call of God?
What if it is true?
Can you live without testing the truth?
Did I see God, Zipporah?
Only you can answer that, Moses.
If I go back to Egypt... as the voice has commanded, they may kill me.
Not if God is with you.
Not if he is sending you to free your people.
I can't even talk in the presence of the Pharaoh.
It is a true call.
You must answer it.
They may kill your husband.
I will trust in God.
Will you?
God be with you.
Aaron.
Aaron, my brother.
-How I've missed you.
-l'm here.
What are you doing here in the middle of the desert?
-God called me to come to you.
-God?
He spoke to me, too.
I know.
Moses has returned!
Moses has come back!
-What are you doing?
-l must let the people know you're here.
Why?
-You are sent by God to free his people.
-But what if--
Moses.
Blessed is the day God chooses to free his people from bondage.
That day has come with your arrival.
The people will want to know.
It has begun.
Moses has arrived!
Moses has returned!
Moses is God's messenger!
He has been chosen by God... to lead his people out of bondage.
Behold the deliverer!
-Moses.
-Miriam.
My brother.
Moses has come back as a messenger of God... to free his people from the Egyptian bondage.
Come, we'll show you.
Gather round, all of you!
Come gather!
Moses has returned as God's messenger.
Gather around.
Witness the power of God... through Moses.
-A few weeks ago, I was on Mount Sinai.
-Speak up!
A few weeks ago, I was on Mount Sinai.
God... the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob... came to me and asked me to return to Egypt to lead you... his chosen people... out of bondage into a land of milk and honey.
Moses the Egyptian.
I was raised in an Egyptian family, but I'm Hebrew by birth.
An Egyptian family.
You were raised by the daughter of the Pharaoh himself.
I believe God asked me to return to lead you out of slavery.
Do you?
And why do you believe this, Egyptian?
Here is a sign God gave me.
-A magic trick.
-No.
The hand of God.
And there is more.
These are the signs of God.
Moses has been called to lead us out of bondage.
-And why would God call an Egyptian?
-Moses is my brother, and you know it.
He's the son of our departed mother Jochabed.
-But he was raised in the way of Egypt.
-Do you question God's ways?
These are the signs of God!
Proof that he's heard us.
Proof that he has come back to us.
Have we followed the way of God through all this... to desert him when he hears us?
Great Egypt, I beseech you, show mercy to this man.
My chief steward says I should show you mercy.
But he's too soft.
Your tax will be paid or your life is forfeited.
Next.
Come forward.
Plead before Great Egypt.
You see, steward?
A steady hand and complaints disappear.
Now if there's no more business....
Who are you to enter my courtroom?
I'll have your head.
I am Moses.
I knew a man by that name once, but he left under cover of night.
God has demanded my return.
So, adopted son of Egypt, from time to time... we wondered where you were.
In... distant lands.
Very distant, I'm sure.
I expected your return for Ptira's entombment... out of gratitude to your Egyptian mother.
I knew nothing of her passing.
And who is this?
I am Aaron, the Levite...
-brother of Moses, Great Egypt.
-Great Egypt.
Exactly right.
So how do you dare to come before me?
-l do as Moses instructs, sire.
-As Moses instructs?
Why did you not tell me, steward, that there are those other than myself... who command the acts of people in my kingdom?
I had no idea there was another authority, sire.
May I be forgiven?
How dare you show your face before me?
It is not by choice, Pharaoh.
I come only because the Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob... has asked me to speak his message.
Do you hear, steward?
A wretch in shepherd's clothes... speaks of a God great enough to decide to whom I... god on earth...
-must give audience.
-But our God... the God of Israel, has shown himself to us.
And these are His words.
He says:
"Let my people go...
"so they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness."
I should have you both killed for daring to come before me... but your blood is unworthy of me.
If Hebrew you must be, so be it.
Go, Moses, take your brother.
Live with the slaves, live there.
Then come back and speak to me of your God.
-Steward!
-Sire?
We can't have slaves dreaming of journeys to the wilderness.
Egypt needs their sweat.
lncrease their workload.
Have them gather their own straw for the bricks they make.
Then demand the same number of bricks be made each day.
Then we'll see if deceitful promises distract them.
Work harder!
Use your strength.
Who is their foreman?
You, Zerack!
Kneel before the steward of Great Egypt.
You failed to meet the prescribed quota of bricks today and yesterday.
We try, master, but now we have to gather our own straw.
As hard as we work, the quota is never reached.
We only want to serve Great Pharaoh.
Then explain why you sent him Moses... to beg that you be allowed three days in the wilderness.
I sent no one, master. I beg of you.
Ask Great Egypt to lift this burden.
You will produce your quota of bricks or you'll be beaten.
-Hold him.
-Guards.
Beat him.
-l don't understand.
-l knew they wouldn't listen to me.
Why should God cause greater suffering?
More hardship?
Look upon this, prophet.
Moses plays us for fools.
There are no voices.
-Look at him, the false prophet.
-Hold your tongue, Zerack.
It was not you under lash, nor was it Moses.
The Pharaoh lets Moses sit and watch, while the rest of us work until we die!
-To make you jealous of him.
-Hold that sharp tongue, woman.
I'm sorry, Zerack.
I believed God spoke to me.
God called you, Moses.
Don't doubt.
If you are not convinced, then how are we to believe it?
Your doubts won't stop Zerack from plotting against you.
You better do something, brother.
Quickly.
Fill me with belief, Lord.
Fill my arms, fill my hands, fill my tongue.
Again, Moses, such insolence to look upon my face.
Why are you here?
As part of my entertainment?
We come with the Word of God.
He bids you, let his people go.
Does he really?
That doesn't fit with my plan, Hebrew.
Ask him to wait, will you?
Are you so sure that I'm a fool and a fake... that you'd risk his wrath?
Risk?
Great Lord!
Now hear me... for God fills my tongue.
The Lord, God of Israel bids you... let his people go.
No one bids Great Egypt... god on earth... anything.
Come here.
Behold, a prince of Egypt... heir to the throne.
Hail, Prince of Egypt.
And now I must bathe in the Nile... as a gift of thanks to Amun.
Stop!
Hear now!
The voice of the Lord, God of Israel.
He bids you let His people go!
Blood.
There will be blood throughout the whole of Egypt for seven days.
The fish will die.
The rivers will stink of death.
Through Moses, the Lord says:
"Know by this that I am the Lord."
The Lord bids Pharaoh, "Let my people go."
Or... he will fall upon you with pestilence and the sword.
No work today.
Rest.
Be at peace with your families!
No work today for any of us.
The Nile is undrinkable.
Every single Egyptian across the entire land... is scratching at the earth for water.
You were right.
And surely now, Pharaoh will let us go.
is it to be that simple?
Isn't it?
God warns us the Pharaoh's heart is hard.
This will not be won easily.
-Great Egypt, your priests have an answer.
-Show me.
Great Lord.
You see?
The Hebrew's trick is easily performed.
And our agents in your upper kingdom report that the waters of great Nile... are now clean and sweet as they flow downriver towards us.
Before seven days have passed, this plague will be only memory.
Good.
Put the Hebrews back to work.
They must make up for the work lost by these games of Moses.
I suppose you and your God take credit for this.
If you do not believe this, then why did you call us before you?
Lift this plague.
I'm tired of these games your God plays.
-Will you let the Lord's people go?
-Yes.
But lift this plague.
-Great Lord--
-Silence!
I want peace.
Get these frogs away.
Take your people to the wilderness for your sacrifice.
I have spoken.
Here you are, go on.
This is our day of freedom !
Praise be to God, Zerack.
We are leaving.
Ready?
Let's go.
Truly, Moses, you are a prophet of God!
I never thought to see the day we would be gone from Egypt.
-You will.
-Will?
Out of my way.
Did you think Pharaoh would be compelled by a silly trick?
To your labors.
-You said Pharaoh released us.
-Line up for work.
-Today is no different from any other day.
-You lied, Moses!
Line up for work!
-You lied, Moses.
-This is your vanity.
The Lord must try Israel... even as he afflicts Egypt.
The people are righteous!
Listen to the people!
-l believed you, Moses!
-Vanity!
All your tricks will not convince me to release Egypt's work force.
It is God's will... that you let his people go.
And who will do the work?
Your God?
Your people cannot survive in freedom, you know that.
You understand the system.
I cannot expect your brother here to understand, but you do.
Slaves are slaves, Moses.
They're happiest being slaves.
Thus says the Lord, "Let my people go so that they may worship me.
"For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people...
"but I have let you live to show my power...
"and to make my name resound through all the earth."
My name resounds through all the earth... and I have let you live.
Let me put you in charge of the Jews.
You can look after them.
You can care for them.
But they must stay.
They can worship who they like.
I've never interfered with their God.
Send everything you have in open field... to a secure place.
Every human and every animal will die... when the hail comes.
Hail?
We are in a desert!
Open the doors!
You are a madman, Moses, do not come before me again.
Do you hear me?
Never again!
If your powers are less than a slave god's... what good is your service or your lives?
Great Egypt, what can be lost by allowing them to worship in the wilderness?
Because once there, they'll never return.
They'll move on!
A hoard of people on our eastern flank, a threat to Egypt!
But what greater threat can Egypt face than these plagues?
They're great magic, my lord.
The omens tell us that while we keep the Hebrews, we will have no peace.
Enough!
Egypt is ruined.
The barley is in the ear, the flax in bud...
-the locusts will eat it all.
-The hand of the Lord.
Blessed be his name.
He is still upon us.
Now will the Pharaoh's heart soften?
If God sees us ready for freedom.
If not, he will harden the Pharaoh's heart... and we will remain slaves.
We will leave this place... when Egypt finally understands the power of the Lord.
You pray to him that you'll be ready for that day when it comes.
Fear not!
God will not let them harm the children of Israel.
You may go.
And all your people with you.
Egypt has decided it no longer... desires you in our midst.
When the Lord lifts the disease from your body, will your heart harden again?
I want you gone.
All of you.
Only your flocks and your herds will remain.
The Lord bids all our possessions go with us.
How else will we have what we need to make sacrifice to Him to show our thanks?
It is to me you owe your gratitude.
You go.
Your flocks remain.
All of us.
Stop.
Our young, our old, our flocks, our herds.
Or you'll face a plague worse than anything the Lord has thus far shown you.
Not one more word... of this foolish God you boast of.
If your flocks are so dear to you, stay with them here in Egypt.
Think carefully on this.
How dare you instruct me!
Get out of my sight!
Be gone and take care never to look upon my face again!
For if ever I see your face one more time... I will kill you!
How long, Lord?
How long?
And with this last plague, the Lord will break the Pharaoh's conceit... and teach us the terrible price of freedom.
Mark well, now what I say to you.
On the 10th day of this month, each family will take a yearling lamb without blemish.
You will watch over this lamb until the 14th day of the month... at which time, the entire assemblage of Israel will gather.
And at twilight on that day, you will slaughter the lamb.
Take some of the lamb's blood and put it on the doorposts of your houses.
The lamb's blood will be a sign.
When the Lord sees the blood, he will pass over you... and you will not be harmed when he strikes the land of Egypt.
You will eat of the lamb the same night.
It must not be raw or cooked with water, only roasted.
And you shall eat it with your clothes on your back and a staff in your hand.
You'll not take time to leaven your bread.
This will be known as the feast of unleavened bread.
And you will eat this Passover offering hurriedly... for at midnight, the Lord shall go forth among the Egyptians... and the Lord will punish the gods of Egypt.
But the blood on the houses where you are will be a sign.
For when He sees the blood, He will pass over you.
Look what you have done to my son.
Your God is evil.
Evil.
Go away from my people.
Take your flocks, take your herds... and be gone.
I have let you go.
Bring a blessing on me.
Please.
Remember this night... on which you came out of Egypt.
Out of the house of slavery.
Because the Lord brought you out... with the strength of his hand.
Go forth, oh, Israel.
-The people wonder, Moses.
-About what?
Why we take this route.
This leads to the Red Sea.
South lies a clear path to the East, to the land of Canaan.
We take the route the Lord ordains.
What have I done... letting Israel leave our service?
-lt was a wise decision, Great Egypt.
-Where are they now?
Approaching the sea, but I caution.
They must pay for this.
Prepare a company of our army.
is this a game, Moses?
Did you bring us out of Egypt so that we could swim to the Promised Land?
I've done as the Lord instructed.
You must do likewise.
They're coming, the Egyptians!
With Pharaoh at their head.
An army of soldiers and chariots.
Save us.
-How far back?
How far behind are they?
-Half a day.
Half a day?
He'll find a way.
Was it that there were no graves in Egypt... that you've brought us here to die in the wilderness?
It would've been better to have served the Egyptians than to die in the desert.
The Lord has shown us the way.
If we follow it, he will deliver us.
It is a male.
Pharaoh has decreed death for all Hebrew newborn males.
I'll see to it.
It's the best way.
Miriam.
At least they'll die quickly.
Moses.
Ptira, come and get your adopted son.
Teach him to stay on his feet.
Memefta.
My son.
Are you ready, Memefta?
- Moses?
- Ready.
Begin.
Moses!
We greet Pharaoh as we greet the sun.
- Pharaoh is Egypt.
- Egypt is Pharaoh.
We offer praise to you on the commemoration of the day... that the great God Rah gave all Egypt the gift of our Pharaoh, Ramses.
I love birthdays.
Especially my own.
And how does my family mark this special occasion?
We all bring offerings to you, god on earth, the sun that lights our lives.
I offer praise to my father on this great day.
You have done well, my daughter.
And what does your son bring?
Moses, are you here?
I'm here, Your Majesty.
I had a game made for you, Great Egypt.
Speak up, Moses, I can't hear you.
A game.
This is very fine woodwork, Moses.
I didn't know that you were so good with your hands.
No, Great Egypt.
I did not make the game myself.
It was made by a Hebrew craftsman at my request...
- especially for you.
- A Hebrew?
I have never been very skilled at games.
Are you?
- No, Great Egypt.
- Moses is too humble, Great Egypt.
- He defeats me in riddles quite often.
- You let him win, Tuntmin...
- as you do with me.
- Never.
- Are you good at riddles, my son?
- I have one for you, Father.
When is an Egyptian not an Egyptian?
I don't know, my son.
When?
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten the answer, Father.
Then it's not a very good riddle, is it?
I'm sure there are those in the court who know the answer.
When you do know the answer...
- ask it again.
- Yes, Father.
And now my gift for you.
A model of the great statue I'm building in honor of my father...
Great Egypt.
Ramses.
Prepare the chariots.
I wish to see where my son has decreed... that I shall stand through the centuries.
Put that back in the cart!
Here, have some water.
You, work harder!
Get up, they'll see you.
- Just rest here for a moment.
- No.
If they see me lying here, they will beat me.
- Just rest.
- Lazy Hebrew, will it take a beating...
- to make you work?
- No!
- You dare interfere, Hebrew?
- No, leave him!
The Pharaoh himself arrives.
Get to your knees, Hebrew.
The Great Ramses is within sight.
Down on your knees!
On your knees.
- Pharaoh is Egypt!
- Pharaoh is Egypt!
- Egypt is Pharaoh!
- Egypt is Pharaoh!
Back to work.
- Moses, you shouldn't come here.
- You say that every time I come... and every time I come, your eyes tell me what a terrible liar you are.
Please, Moses, they mustn't see me being idle.
They won't bother you.
Get up!
- How are you?
- I am well, Moses.
- And you?
- I want for nothing.
- Except...
- Except?
I have to go.
Expect me tonight.
Goodbye, Moses.
Give him a hand over there.
Come on, hurry!
You're not Hebrew, Moses.
You sucked at the breast of a Hebrew.
Nothing else.
You are an Egyptian prince.
Be proud.
Why?
Because Egyptians are powerful?
No.
Because it's what you are.
I'm not Egyptian, nor Hebrew.
I'm nothing.
Don't speak this way, or you shall offend the gods.
Which gods?
The gods that you teach me to worship or the God that Jochabed loves?
Jochabed was your wet nurse, nothing more.
- She lies if she says she was more.
- She tells me nothing more.
- But I know the truth.
- The truth is that I am your mother.
- You are a royal prince of Egypt.
- I'm nothing!
Pharaoh knows it, the court knows it, the nation knows it.
Only you pretend, Mother.
Move along.
Keep moving.
I want to get home.
No!
You thought you would get away with it, didn't you?
- No, master, please, I meant no harm!
- You made me look like a fool.
No!
Moses.
You've killed him.
You've killed an Egyptian.
Aaron.
Keep digging, Hur.
It's not deep enough.
Come on, pick up the body.
Cover it with some mud.
- Quickly.
- We have to go.
We must cover him.
Leave him.
You saved my life.
Why?
Why?
You're my brother, Aaron.
God be with you, Moses.
What do you want here?
- I want to see my mother.
- Moses, no.
- You don't belong here.
You're Egyptian.
- Aaron.
- I'm here to see my mother.
- Moses, no.
I'm here, my son.
Mother.
Forgive me, Moses.
It was my only way to save you from the sword of Ramses.
I am Hebrew.
You are whatever you choose to be.
God has given you a choice He has given to no other man.
- But I've taken it away.
- What do you mean?
Why are you wearing these rough clothes?
- I'm leaving Egypt.
- Leaving?
Tonight.
Didn't Aaron tell you?
Aaron?
I have so many questions... but now...
I must go.
God saved you, Moses.
Serve him well.
Fill the trough.
Drive the flock forward.
But, Zipporah, Father said not to look for trouble.
He doesn't have to spend half of every day waiting until the men are through.
They have struck us before.
They'll do it again.
Fill the trough.
Come.
See how fortunate we are?
The priest's daughters have filled the trough for our flock.
You are mistaken.
The water is for my father's flock.
Really?
Jethro's sheep can wait.
Perhaps.
But my sisters and I can't.
Drive the flock forward.
Do as I say.
May I drink at your well?
Thank you.
If you would drink, you'd better ask my permission.
Nobody makes a fool of me.
You ignore me at your peril, stranger.
Now there's no point in strutting for the sisters.
- You're one and we are four.
- What's your name, shepherd?
Midan.
What's yours?
Moses, son of Ptira, daughter of Ramses.
- Ramses.
- Look inside my cloak.
My cloak.
- Egyptian.
- It's Egyptian army.
I serve Ramses himself.
His army can probably be seen from the top of that ridge.
They'll need lambs to eat.
Shall we take your sheep... or those of the women?
Move the sheep.
Quick.
What did you say to him that made him so afraid?
You're shaking, yet you're brave.
Why?
- I was not brave.
- You were brave.
Why?
I was angry.
Sometimes...
He knocked you down.
That was wrong.
My father is Jethro.
He's the priest of Midian.
He'll be grateful.
- I'll be on my way.
- But my father...
No, it's best.
Go well.
You're back soon.
Father!
An Egyptian stopped Midan from taking our place at the trough.
An Egyptian?
Or a gang of them?
- No, Father, just one.
- But a very brave one.
Is that him?
He deserves a show of gratitude.
I asked him to stay, Father, but...
Go fetch him, daughter!
My, what great pleasure it is for me to have another man at my table.
My life is surrounded by women.
A father needs a son amongst his family.
As you saw today at the well, we live in a time of rough men... with little respect for women.
I'm a priest to the people of Midian... which lies just beyond the ridge.
What gods do you worship, Moses?
In Egypt, we have many gods.
- The Hebrew slaves have only one.
- Yes.
You know of him?
Is He above other gods?
I haven't heard much of his power for many years.
My Hebrew wet nurse... she says that he will deliver them from slavery.
From the Egyptians?
That will be an act of great power.
You're a man of many fascinating thoughts and ideas, Moses.
But not many words.
It would be worth our while to persuade you to stay for a time.
There's no better kitchen in the entire region.
Zipporah makes sure of that.
And no one weaves finer fabric than we do.
- Also under Zipporah's eye.
- They exaggerate, Moses.
I'm sure it's all true, but I must be on my way.
East?
Mostly barren land.
What towns do exist rarely welcome strangers.
Why not stay here... until you have a better idea of where you're headed?
- Yes, please stay.
- Please stay.
- You're very kind, but...
- Good, that's agreed.
A full day has passed since great Pharaoh has shown any sign of mortal spark.
Let Egypt rejoice.
My father has rejoined the gods of the other world.
Give thanks to great Pharaoh.
The sun and moon live in him.
Arise.
Tuntmin, you may look upon me.
Egypt's people shall mourn for one full phase of the moon... while the holy embalmers prepare my father... for his journey to the other world.
As it is said, so shall it be done.
Then I shall take my place on the sun throne.
- As it is said, so shall it be done.
- Good.
Let the mourning begin.
- You counted them?
- I have.
- Every one?
- Every one.
Dried lamb, bread, dates, and the water.
- Is that enough for you?
- It's two or three days.
I'll see them settled for summer grazing, then I'll return.
- Take care.
- I will.
- Beware of the wolves.
- I will.
Yes, you've lost your mum.
You've lost your mama.
Strange.
No lightning.
Come, let's go and see.
You burn, but the flames don't consume you.
Moses.
Here I am.
Remove your sandals... for the place wher e you stand is holy gr ound.
Be at peace.
I am the God of your fathers...
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.
Why do you come to me?
I ha ve heard the cry of m y people, Israel.
I will send you to the Pharaoh... and you shall fr ee m y people fr om Egypt.
Why me?
A man clumsy with words.
Who am I to go before the Pharaoh?
I will be with you.
If I go to the Israelites and say that God has sent me... they won't believe me.
They'll ask, "What is his name?"
I am who I am.
They won't listen.
Why should they?
They'll seek signs.
That r od, cast it to the gr ound.
Grasp it by the tail.
Now put your hand under your cloak.
Now withdraw it.
No.
Now r eplace your hand... and then withdraw it.
This will be the sign that you speak... with the voice of the Lord their God.
Please.
Lord.
Not me.
I've never been a man of words.
Not in times past, not now.
Even as you speak to me...
I'm still...
I'm still of speech!
Your br other, Aar on, will meet you... and you will be m y voice to him, and he will speak for you to the people.
Jethro!
Moses!
Maybe I was dreaming or mad from the sun.
- Or perhaps God spoke to you.
- Why would God speak to me?
- Why not you?
- Because I don't know God...
I know nothing of God!
- In Egypt they have many gods.
- Which god spoke to you?
The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
- But you're Egyptian.
- No.
I'm Hebrew.
I had two mothers.
I came from the womb of Jochabed, a Hebrew slave.
But I was raised up by Ptira, daughter of Ramses himself.
Ramses?
Both mothers... spoke to me of God, but...
I've yet to find my God, I can't find him.
God doesn't speak to anyone.
- He knows your heart.
- Even a murderer?
Does he speak to murderers?
Does he know the heart of a murderer?
What are you saying?
Moses?
In Egypt I killed a man.
It's why I ran.
It's why I came here.
They killed so many of them.
Of us!
And I survive.
And I kill!
I know nothing of this.
But I do know...
God speaks for a purpose...
- and you heard your God's voice.
- Did I?
Are you mad?
No, you're not.
You saw the bush.
You heard the voice.
- God has spoken to you.
- Has he?
Did he not give you a sign?
Did he not change your staff into a serpent...
- as you told us?
- As I told you.
- It was God.
- Was it?
Was it God?
What could be more real than the call of God?
What if it is true?
Can you live without testing the truth?
Did I see God, Zipporah?
Only you can answer that, Moses.
If I go back to Egypt... as the voice has commanded, they may kill me.
Not if God is with you.
Not if he is sending you to free your people.
I can't even talk in the presence of the Pharaoh.
It is a true call.
You must answer it.
They may kill your husband.
I will trust in God.
Will you?
God be with you.
Aaron.
Aaron, my brother.
- How I've missed you.
- I'm here.
What are you doing here in the middle of the desert?
- God called me to come to you.
- God?
He spoke to me, too.
I know.
Moses has returned!
Moses has come back!
- What are you doing?
- I must let the people know you're here.
Why?
- You are sent by God to free his people.
- But what if...
Moses.
Blessed is the day God chooses to free his people from bondage.
That day has come with your arrival.
The people will want to know.
It has begun.
Moses has arrived!
Moses has returned!
Moses is God's messenger!
He has been chosen by God... to lead his people out of bondage.
Behold the deliverer!
- Moses.
- Miriam.
My brother.
Moses has come back as a messenger of God... to free his people from the Egyptian bondage.
Come, we'll show you.
Gather round, all of you!
Come gather!
Moses has returned as God's messenger.
Gather around.
Witness the power of God... through Moses.
- A few weeks ago, I was on Mount Sinai.
- Speak up!
A few weeks ago, I was on Mount Sinai.
God... the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob... came to me and asked me to return to Egypt to lead you... his chosen people... out of bondage into a land of milk and honey.
Moses the Egyptian.
I was raised in an Egyptian family, but I'm Hebrew by birth.
An Egyptian family.
You were raised by the daughter of the Pharaoh himself.
I believe God asked me to return to lead you out of slavery.
Do you?
And why do you believe this, Egyptian?
Here is a sign God gave me.
- A magic trick.
- No.
The hand of God.
And there is more.
These are the signs of God.
Moses has been called to lead us out of bondage.
- And why would God call an Egyptian?
- Moses is my brother, and you know it.
He's the son of our departed mother Jochabed.
- But he was raised in the way of Egypt.
- Do you question God's ways?
These are the signs of God!
Proof that he's heard us.
Proof that he has come back to us.
Have we followed the way of God through all this... to desert him when he hears us?
Great Egypt, I beseech you, show mercy to this man.
My chief steward says I should show you mercy.
But he's too soft.
Your tax will be paid or your life is forfeited.
Next.
Come forward.
Plead before Great Egypt.
You see, steward?
A steady hand and complaints disappear.
Now if there's no more business...
Who are you to enter my courtroom?
I'll have your head.
I am Moses.
I knew a man by that name once, but he left under cover of night.
God has demanded my return.
So, adopted son of Egypt, from time to time... we wondered where you were.
In... distant lands.
Very distant, I'm sure.
I expected your return for Ptira's entombment... out of gratitude to your Egyptian mother.
I knew nothing of her passing.
And who is this?
I am Aaron, the Levite...
- brother of Moses, Great Egypt.
- Great Egypt.
Exactly right.
So how do you dare to come before me?
- I do as Moses instructs, sire.
- As Moses instructs?
Why did you not tell me, steward, that there are those other than myself... who command the acts of people in my kingdom?
I had no idea there was another authority, sire.
May I be forgiven?
How dare you show your face before me?
It is not by choice, Pharaoh.
I come only because the Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob... has asked me to speak his message.
Do you hear, steward?
A wretch in shepherd's clothes... speaks of a God great enough to decide to whom I... god on earth...
- must give audience.
- But our God... the God of Israel, has shown himself to us.
And these are His words.
He says:
"Let my people go...
"so they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness. "
I should have you both killed for daring to come before me... but your blood is unworthy of me.
If Hebrew you must be, so be it.
Go, Moses, take your brother.
Live with the slaves, live there.
Then come back and speak to me of your God.
- Steward!
- Sire?
We can't have slaves dreaming of journeys to the wilderness.
Egypt needs their sweat.
Increase their workload.
Have them gather their own straw for the bricks they make.
Then demand the same number of bricks be made each day.
Then we'll see if deceitful promises distract them.
Work harder!
Use your strength.
Who is their foreman?
You, Zerack!
Kneel before the steward of Great Egypt.
You failed to meet the prescribed quota of bricks today and yesterday.
We try, master, but now we have to gather our own straw.
As hard as we work, the quota is never reached.
We only want to serve Great Pharaoh.
Then explain why you sent him Moses... to beg that you be allowed three days in the wilderness.
I sent no one, master.
I beg of you.
Ask Great Egypt to lift this burden.
You will produce your quota of bricks or you'll be beaten.
- Hold him.
- Guards.
Beat him.
- I don't understand.
- I knew they wouldn't listen to me.
Why should God cause greater suffering?
More hardship?
Look upon this, prophet.
Moses plays us for fools.
There are no voices.
- Look at him, the false prophet.
- Hold your tongue, Zerack.
It was not you under lash, nor was it Moses.
The Pharaoh lets Moses sit and watch, while the rest of us work until we die!
- To make you jealous of him.
- Hold that sharp tongue, woman.
I'm sorry, Zerack.
I believed God spoke to me.
God called you, Moses.
Don't doubt.
If you are not convinced, then how are we to believe it?
Your doubts won't stop Zerack from plotting against you.
You better do something, brother.
Quickly.
Fill me with belief, Lord.
Fill my arms, fill my hands, fill my tongue.
Again, Moses, such insolence to look upon my face.
Why are you here?
As part of my entertainment?
We come with the Word of God.
He bids you, let his people go.
Does he really?
That doesn't fit with my plan, Hebrew.
Ask him to wait, will you?
Are you so sure that I'm a fool and a fake... that you'd risk his wrath?
Risk?
Great Lord!
Now hear me... for God fills my tongue.
The Lord, God of Israel bids you... let his people go.
No one bids Great Egypt... god on earth... anything.
Come here.
Behold, a prince of Egypt... heir to the throne.
Hail, Prince of Egypt.
And now I must bathe in the Nile... as a gift of thanks to Amun.
Stop!
Hear now!
The voice of the Lord, God of Israel.
He bids you let His people go!
Blood.
There will be blood throughout the whole of Egypt for seven days.
The fish will die.
The rivers will stink of death.
Through Moses, the Lord says:
"Know by this that I am the Lord. "
The Lord bids Pharaoh, "Let my people go. "
Or... he will fall upon you with pestilence and the sword.
No work today.
Rest.
Be at peace with your families!
No work today for any of us.
The Nile is undrinkable.
Every single Egyptian across the entire land... is scratching at the earth for water.
You were right.
And surely now, Pharaoh will let us go.
Is it to be that simple?
Isn't it?
God warns us the Pharaoh's heart is hard.
This will not be won easily.
- Great Egypt, your priests have an answer.
- Show me.
Great Lord.
You see?
The Hebrew's trick is easily performed.
And our agents in your upper kingdom report that the waters of great Nile... are now clean and sweet as they flow downriver towards us.
Before seven days have passed, this plague will be only memory.
Good.
Put the Hebrews back to work.
They must make up for the work lost by these games of Moses.
I suppose you and your God take credit for this.
If you do not believe this, then why did you call us before you?
Lift this plague.
I'm tired of these games your God plays.
- Will you let the Lord's people go?
- Yes.
But lift this plague.
- Great Lord...
- Silence!
I want peace.
Get these frogs away.
Take your people to the wilderness for your sacrifice.
I have spoken.
Here you are, go on.
This is our day of freedom!
Praise be to God, Zerack.
We are leaving.
Ready?
Let's go.
Truly, Moses, you are a prophet of God!
I never thought to see the day we would be gone from Egypt.
- You will.
- Will?
Out of my way.
Did you think Pharaoh would be compelled by a silly trick?
To your labors.
- You said Pharaoh released us.
- Line up for work.
- Today is no different from any other day.
- You lied, Moses!
Line up for work!
- You lied, Moses.
- This is your vanity.
The Lord must try Israel... even as he afflicts Egypt.
The people are righteous!
Listen to the people!
- I believed you, Moses!
- Vanity!
All your tricks will not convince me to release Egypt's work force.
It is God's will... that you let his people go.
And who will do the work?
Your God?
Your people cannot survive in freedom, you know that.
You understand the system.
I cannot expect your brother here to understand, but you do.
Slaves are slaves, Moses.
They're happiest being slaves.
Thus says the Lord, "Let my people go so that they may worship me.
"For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people...
"but I have let you live to show my power...
"and to make my name resound through all the earth. "
My name resounds through all the earth... and I have let you live.
Let me put you in charge of the Jews.
You can look after them.
You can care for them.
But they must stay.
They can worship who they like.
I've never interfered with their God.
Send everything you have in open field... to a secure place.
Every human and every animal will die... when the hail comes.
Hail?
We are in a desert!
Open the doors!
You are a madman, Moses, do not come before me again.
Do you hear me?
Never again!
If your powers are less than a slave god's... what good is your service or your lives?
Great Egypt, what can be lost by allowing them to worship in the wilderness?
Because once there, they'll never return.
They'll move on!
A hoard of people on our eastern flank, a threat to Egypt!
But what greater threat can Egypt face than these plagues?
They're great magic, my lord.
The omens tell us that while we keep the Hebrews, we will have no peace.
Enough!
Egypt is ruined.
The barley is in the ear, the flax in bud...
- the locusts will eat it all.
- The hand of the Lord.
Blessed be his name.
He is still upon us.
Now will the Pharaoh's heart soften?
If God sees us ready for freedom.
If not, he will harden the Pharaoh's heart... and we will remain slaves.
We will leave this place... when Egypt finally understands the power of the Lord.
You pray to him that you'll be ready for that day when it comes.
Fear not!
God will not let them harm the children of Israel.
You may go.
And all your people with you.
Egypt has decided it no longer... desires you in our midst.
When the Lord lifts the disease from your body, will your heart harden again?
I want you gone.
All of you.
Only your flocks and your herds will remain.
The Lord bids all our possessions go with us.
How else will we have what we need to make sacrifice to Him to show our thanks?
It is to me you owe your gratitude.
You go.
Your flocks remain.
All of us.
Stop.
Our young, our old, our flocks, our herds.
Or you'll face a plague worse than anything the Lord has thus far shown you.
Not one more word... of this foolish God you boast of.
If your flocks are so dear to you, stay with them here in Egypt.
Think carefully on this.
How dare you instruct me!
Get out of my sight!
Be gone and take care never to look upon my face again!
For if ever I see your face one more time...
I will kill you!
How long, Lord?
How long?
And with this last plague, the Lord will break the Pharaoh's conceit... and teach us the terrible price of freedom.
Mark well, now what I say to you.
On the 10th day of this month, each family will take a yearling lamb without blemish.
You will watch over this lamb until the 14th day of the month... at which time, the entire assemblage of Israel will gather.
And at twilight on that da y, you will slaughter the lamb.
Take some of the lamb's blood and put it on the doorposts of your houses.
The lamb's blood will be a sign.
When the Lord sees the blood, he will pass over you... and you will not be harmed when he strikes the land of Egypt.
You will eat of the lamb the same night.
It must not be raw or cooked with water, only r oasted.
And you shall eat it with your clothes on your back and a staff in your hand.
You'll not take time to lea ven your br ead.
This will be known as the feast of unlea vened br ead.
And you will eat this Passover offering hurriedly... for at midnight, the Lord shall go forth among the Egyptians... and the Lord will punish the gods of Egypt.
But the blood on the houses wher e you ar e will be a sign.
For when He sees the blood, He will pass over you.
Look what you have done to my son.
Your God is evil.
Evil.
Go away from my people.
Take your flocks, take your herds... and be gone.
I have let you go.
Bring a blessing on me.
Please.
Remember this night... on which you came out of Egypt.
Out of the house of slavery.
Because the Lord brought you out... with the strength of his hand.
Go forth, oh, Israel.
- The people wonder, Moses.
- About what?
Why we take this route.
This leads to the Red Sea.
South lies a clear path to the East, to the land of Canaan.
We take the route the Lord ordains.
What have I done... letting Israel leave our service?
- It was a wise decision, Great Egypt.
- Where are they now?
Approaching the sea, but I caution.
They must pay for this.
Prepare a company of our army.
Is this a game, Moses?
Did you bring us out of Egypt so that we could swim to the Promised Land?
I've done as the Lord instructed.
You must do likewise.
They're coming, the Egyptians!
With Pharaoh at their head.
An army of soldiers and chariots.
Save us.
- How far back?
How far behind are they?
- Half a day.
Half a day?
He'll find a way.
Was it that there were no graves in Egypt... that you've brought us here to die in the wilderness?
It would've been better to have served the Egyptians than to die in the desert.
The Lord has shown us the way.
If we follow it, he will deliver us.
What's he doing?
He's trying to blow the Egyptians away.
Look.
Everyone, look!
Oh, my Lord!
All hail the power of the Lord!
He has turned his face towards us.
Forward!
Death to any man who disobeys!
Forward!
Forward!
He has triumphed!
The Lord is my strength and my might.
This is my God... and I will praise Him.
Who is like the Lord?
Who among the mighty?
In your steadfast love... you led the people whom you redeemed!
You guided them with your strength.
The Lord will reign!
Yes.
Forever and ever!
Look at Moses up there.
Nothing stops him.
Speak up, Eliav!
My stomach's growling so loudly I cannot hear you.
Listen to you bleating like a lamb waiting at the slaughter.
Slaughter there will be if we don't eat soon.
Well, did the Lord fill any of your empty stomachs today?
Did God lead us into the desert to starve?
If it is God's will, so be it.
Do you have a plan, Moses, or not?
I demand to know.
To follow God's will as always.
For us to starve in this godforsaken place?
Godforsaken?
God has shown you the way.
You can call it godforsaken.
Your people are starving, Moses!
What are you going to do about it?
Did you follow this man into the desert to starve?
Truly, Moses is a great man.
But somewhere he has lost contact with God's will.
We must help him now!
Look!
Fire!
Hurry!
Moses, help us!
Please.
- Moses, stop the fire!
- Enough!
Moses, you have the power!
Stop the fire!
Praying won't help.
Come.
Throw sand on the fire.
He can't help you now.
Praying won't help.
Do something!
Help!
Throw sand on the fire!
He can't help you.
Eliav!
Stop the fire, Moses!
Why do you lay the burden of all the people on me?
Did I conceive these people?
Did I give birth to them?
I cannot carry all these people alone!
They're too heavy for me.
The people are waiting, Moses.
- For what?
- For God to feed them.
God didn't lead us here to die, Moses.
Go into your tents.
Don't come out until the morning.
God himself will provide bread.
Bread?
How?
Not a stalk of grain within a month's journey.
Go into your tents.
Don't come out until morning.
What is it?
Eat it.
Delicious.
Like coriander seed.
Sisters, gather it up.
Men, get some baskets and help to gather it up.
It's a gift from God.
We will call it, "manna. "
Manna.
The bread that the Lord has given you to eat.
Every morning you will gather as much as needed for a single day.
You will receive this as a gift.
Take no more than is needed for a single day... because each day the Lord will see to your needs.
If you lack faith in the Lord and take more, it will rot.
It will rot.
- It's good.
- Now that you're free men... you may rest every seventh day.
This will be the Sabbath, and you will not have to work.
- The Sabbath?
- No work?
- What's the Sabbath?
- No work on the Sabbath.
How can we?
- You rest.
- What does it mean?
God says to me, "There is no work on the Sabbath...
"you will rest, you will not gather the manna on that day...
"but on the sixth day, you will take a double ration which will not rot. "
No work, rest.
- Sabbath.
- No work.
Remember this the next time you grow impatient with God, Zerack.
Do you expect us to live on bread alone?
This day the Lord will send you meat.
Meat?
We haven't seen meat since we left Egypt.
The Lord will send you meat.
And you will eat it till it comes out of your nostrils.
Meat.
Jethro.
I've heard of all your God has done for you, Moses.
I had to come.
See for myself.
God has been good to us.
- How's Zipporah?
- She's well.
I miss her.
She understands, Moses.
She understands.
You are a liar!
This has gone on 10 days, it's too long.
You must honor the bond.
Benjamin... know in your heart that just as a parent disciplines a child... so the Lord your God must discipline you.
That's all for today, Moses must rest.
Tomorrow Moses will hear your cases.
He must rest now.
The sun's almost gone.
Why do you sit alone in judgment all day?
I make known to them the statutes and instructions of God as you've seen.
What I've seen is the people feeding off you and you allowing it to happen.
And you've allowed it to happen.
Do you not love your brother?
You have no right to ask such a question.
And you, none of you... have any right to let Moses be destroyed by his own people.
Look at him.
He can hardly stand.
Is this how your God rewards his servants?
Jethro!
Your tongue's too sharp.
But you speak the truth.
This task is too heavy for a single man, Moses.
Your God did not mean for you to be his only voice.
Aaron was called also by God.
Listen to me... and I will give you counsel for a change.
You must...
look for men... who fear your God... and set these men as officers over the people.
Let them settle the small matters... bring you only the important ones.
Now if you do this, you will be able to endure... and these people will go home in peace.
I wonder why it is so hard to listen to someone speak the truth?
Do I speak the truth?
How many times do you want me to say it?
You're a hard teacher, Jethro.
Yes, you speak the truth.
These people... are still learning to live without the law of their slave masters.
- God will reveal his law to us.
- But will you be ready?
You can ask that?
We travel the world, in us trusting in God's plan every day.
Have you traded an Egyptian slave owner, for a taskmaster in the heavens?
Profanity.
Laws are not sufficient by themselves... and the people must learn to follow the law without Moses or any leader.
They must learn to want to follow the law... without fear of any whip on their backs... on their souls.
To follow the law... because they are free not to.
When they have learned that, they will truly be free.
Until then... they are still slaves.
This is my dream, Jethro.
To no longer be needed.
You're a wise man, Moses.
I'll begin by choosing God-fearing men tomorrow.
Tonight.
I'll begin by choosing Aaron.
Thank you for your counsel.
Where will you go now, Moses?
I believe God is leading us to Mount Sinai.
- I wish you pure water and green grass.
- As God wishes.
Mount Sinai.
- Where God first spoke to me.
- In the burning bush.
God is calling me up there.
Do you think I'll make it, Joshua?
If God is calling you, Moses.
I wish he'd given me a better pair of sandals first.
Moses.
Moses!
- Moses is coming!
- Moses!
Hear now, oh, Israel.
Hear the words of the Lord.
Hear His word.
God says to you:
"You've seen what I did to the Egyptians!
"I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to me.
"If you will be faithful to me and heed my covenant...
"you shall be my treasured possession...
"amongst all peoples. "
God says to you, "All the earth is mine.
"But you shall be to me a kingdom of priests...
"and a holy nation, if you'll obey my law...
"and heed my covenant, " God says to you.
All the words which the Lord hath spoken we will obey.
We will obey!
Gladly!
Did the Lord appear to you, Moses?
You wish to hear his voice yourselves?
The people need to know that the word is truly his and not yours.
You doubt me, Zerack?
If you would hear the words of the Lord yourselves... then you must be prepared and consecrated.
Water over here.
The Lord has said to me:
"Ha ve the people wash their clothes.
"For thr ee da ys, they will not lie with their wives.
"Pr epar e for the third da y...
"when I will come upon Mount Sinai...
"in the sight of the people. "
Purify your hearts, not only your robes... for you will be in the presence of God.
My task is almost complete, Aaron.
After today...
God will no longer need a mediator.
He'll speak directly to the people.
No, the people will always need a leader, Moses.
No, Aaron...
I'm not a leader.
I'm an ordinary man who happened to be chosen... but now that we're out of Egypt... through God's will and power, my task is complete.
You stand assembled today before the Lord your God... to enter into a covenant which he is making with you... in order that he may establish you as his people... and that he may be your God.
If you obey the commandments that God will give you today... then you will live and become numerous and the Lord will bless you... in the land he has promised to...
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
God of Abraham... we wait upon you.
Speak to us!
Moses!
Do not let God speak to us!
Moses!
Do not let God speak to us!
Do not be afraid of him.
We will surely die, Moses!
Do not be afraid... it is your God!
You speak to us, we will listen!
No!
I am but a man!
If I can hear him, so can you!
Do not be afraid!
Listen to His voice!
You must hear Him for us!
Moses!
- Please!
We will surely die!
- Yes.
Israel!
Hear the word of the Lord.
The Lord has spoken and said:
"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of bondage!
"You will have no other gods besides me!
"You will make no graven image...
"nor bow down, nor worship any idol.
"You shall not swear falsely in the name of the Lord.
"Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy!"
Remember the Sabbath.
"Honor your father and your mother...
"that you may stay long in the land the Lord your God will assign you.
"You shall not murder!
"You shall not commit adultery!
"You shall not steal!
"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor!
"You shall not covet your neighbor's house!
"Nor his wife, nor anything that is your neighbor's!"
The Lord has spoken!
He has pronounced his law!
The law of his covenant!
Do you hear, oh, Israel?
Yes, Moses!
I must go back on the mountain.
For God wishes to... give you his law.
You will stay here.
You will remain pure while you wait for my return.
Stay pure to receive the law... he will send down.
Joshua, come with me.
Purify your soul.
Purify your heart.
This is madness.
Thirty days and nothing.
He had no food when he left.
Thank you, Korah.
Do I look so awful that my presence makes you silent?
No.
We were just gossiping.
Stop it, Korah.
Tell the man the truth.
After all, isn't he the brother of Moses?
Which is not the same as Moses himself.
So surely you can speak openly to me.
Moses has been gone four phases of the moon.
Thirty days on Mount Sinai.
It's a long time without any food.
- What do you want me to do?
- Go up after Moses?
You know that's impossible.
We were told to wait and to keep pure.
Keep pure?
We wash three times a day.
But for what?
Not for what, Zerack, but for who.
We'll do as Moses said and wait.
Easy to say, but hard to enforce, Aaron.
You have no faith if you think they aren't returning.
People are nervous, restless.
You must do something.
- Aaron.
- Yes.
Look, we do nothing more than Moses instructed.
Have you forgotten your fear at the storm?
No, of course not.
So we'll do as we promised and wait.
For how long?
Please, listen!
Silence!
For the love of all you hold holy... silence!
Thirty-two days since Moses went up the mountain.
And no sign of him.
Are we to wait here forever?
Did we come up from Egypt... to be abandoned in the desert?
Then go back!
Always the same threat.
Are these the only choices left to us?
Blind obedience to Pharaoh or even blinder obedience to an old man... who's probably perished in the wilderness of Mount Sinai?
He's not perished!
Do you have a third option, Zerack?
Yes.
- Stop relying on Moses.
- Yes.
We don't even know what has become of him.
Let us find our own way of seeking God.
Fashion our own tribute to God.
We will fashion his image with our own hands so that we can see him, touch him.
You heard the voice of the Lord yourself.
He commanded us to have no idols.
Not an idol, Aaron.
A tribute!
Fashioned from the best gold, the best precious metals... the best gems we possess.
It can be our guide out of this wilderness!
Aaron, don't listen to them.
God has been our savior so far.
And he will remain with us if we're true to his word.
- Yes.
- How long before you admit... that Moses has died... that he perished on Mount Sinai?
Moses is not dead!
Only your faith in God is dead!
Hold your tongue, woman!
The people need something to look to for inspiration now.
- Yes, Aaron.
- But a graven image...
No, a symbol!
A guide to show the way.
How long must we wait?
Seven days.
- Why?
Why seven days?
- Give him seven days.
By then Moses will return.
I'm sure of it.
Aaron, do you have any doubt of Moses' return?
Are you ready to abandon the Lord's word this easily?
I said seven days, Miriam, and seven days it's been.
Aaron!
They'll do what they want.
You know that.
We have discussed this amongst ourselves.
We have waited the seven days.
It's time for us to take matters into our own hands.
On your head be it, Zerack.
He's seen the truth!
Gather up all your gold and gems.
Your earrings, your bracelets!
Bring down the smiths and the metal workers to me!
Blessed be this symbol of the great force that led us out of Egypt.
We consecrate your image, and ask that you be with us now.
Greet the birth of this image of the Almighty!
Celebrate its presence in our midst!
Celebrate!
Is this how you serve God in my absence?
I'm not like you, brother.
I am a weak man.
We thought you were dead, Moses.
What else were we to think?
The word of the Lord.
The hand of God.
A path... to lead you out of the wilderness...
- of your own hearts.
- No, Moses!
No!
If that was the word of God, Moses... it was easily shattered.
Can't you see?
Moses can't lead us out of here.
Let the calf go ahead of us... and let other tribes see our wealth and power.
You have broken God's covenant.
It lies on the ground before you.
Those of you who would still choose to be with God... come stand by my side now.
My brothers.
Fellow Levites.
Have you come this far to turn your back on the Lord?
Come stand with us.
Stand with your tribesmen now.
Are you fools?
Do you wish to die in the desert?
Stand with me... and we will take our own freedom.
Those of you who would be with God, stand with me.
Those of you who would be delivered from the wilderness... stand with me.
We'll break camp in the morning.
The calf will lead us.
You're a fool, Moses.
We'll go our own way.
There's nothing you can do about it.
Lay them waste.
Moses.
Thus says the Lord:
"Whomsoever has sinned against me...
"I will blot out of my book. "
Do God's work.
Purify Israel.
Moses.
No!
You will grind the idol into dust!
You will put it in the water!
You will drink your evil ways!
And taste its bitterness!
Where are you going?
To seek God's forgiveness.
Maybe I can make atonement for your sins.
Moses!
It's Moses!
See the blood of the covenant, the Lord has made with you.
Look upon your work, Israel.
This will be your sanctuary.
The place for meeting God.
The Lord bless you and keep you.
The Lord make his face to shine upon you... and be gracious to you.
The Lord lift up his countenance upon you... and give you peace.
Ten days since we left Sinai and still no end to this wandering.
Nothing to eat but this daily portion of manna.
Do you remember the feast days in Egypt...
- when we ate fish till we burst?
- True.
There was a richness of food, even vegetables.
But they were only given to us at the Pharaoh's pleasure.
But at least it was given to us.
Is that how you wish to live, Miriam?
Eating or starving at another man's whim?
I travel the desert at my brother's whim.
Do you think I'm so arrogant that I decide the fate of Israel?
Do you think it was me who brought you out of Egypt?
No, I think it was all of us.
Has the Lord spoken only through you, Moses?
Didn't God call you to the wilderness to meet Moses?
It was you who gave the Lord a voice in front of the Pharaoh.
Has God spoken only through Moses?
No.
Miriam, how can you say such a thing?
You know that Moses is a humble man, he seeks no glory.
- You stay out of this.
- Miriam.
All this wandering is so aimless.
Surely God knows the route to the land he's promised us.
Yes, and when he sees we're ready he'll deliver us there.
- You think we're not ready?
- Well, do you?
If God brought us to Canaan tomorrow, would we know what to do?
Would we be able to see his law being followed?
Could we organize ourselves?
A kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
We have wealth in our children, and a desire to settle on our own land.
What more do we need?
Brotherhood.
And a willingness to serve more than our own stomachs.
Miriam, what's the matter?
Hold still, Miriam.
Be still.
- Leprosy.
- Oh, my Lord!
Do not punish her for her sins.
Do not let her be consumed, Lord.
Please, heal her.
God says she must be shut out of the camp for seven days... after which time she may be brought in again.
She will be healed then.
Take her.
Take her.
God is being merciful.
Unclean.
Unclean.
It's Moses, Miriam.
I've brought you some food.
Stay away, Moses.
I'm not afraid, and you have to eat.
Go away.
- Please.
Go away.
- No.
Why are you doing this?
You're my sister.
I'm sorry you thought me so arrogant.
I spoke in anger, and God has punished me.
God talks to me, Miriam... just as I'm talking to you.
I don't deserve his presence.
Why did God choose me, why me?
Don't let my sin punish both of us.
God has chosen you, and I am your sister... and that's God's will.
Rejoice.
All this will soon be over.
We will journey to the Promised Land.
All of us together.
It is so green and lush as far as the eye can see.
Oh, Moses, it's beautiful.
Truly, Moses, we should never have doubted you.
There is the Promised Land.
We should never have doubted you.
You should always question me, Korah, but never the word of the Lord.
As he promised us, so it shall be.
When will the Lord appear to lead us forward?
- He won't.
- What?
Look at our numbers.
Are we expected simply to walk into Canaan and occupy it?
How else will it be delivered into our hands?
Surely the Lord will do it for us.
We must act for ourselves, Eliav, if we are to be a free people.
Joshua, select 12 men, one from each of the tribes of Israel... lead them across the plain into Canaan, look closely at everything you see... then return with your news.
Caleb, from the tribe of Judah.
Shammua.
Nahbi.
Shaphat.
Igal.
We will all die if we try to occupy this land.
Are you too scared to lead us to the land God promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?
I won't lead my family to certain death or enslavement.
God will be with us.
He will lead.
Be reasonable, Joshua.
We've spent 40 days here. 40 days.
You saw the same things we saw.
The cities are heavily fortified and the people are strong.
And there are so many, Joshua.
But what good will their numbers be against the strength of the God... who delivered us from Egypt and destroyed the Pharaoh's army?
Would you risk the life of your children on it, Joshua?
Where the Lord leads there is no risk.
Come.
Madness, Joshua, madness.
You sound like a madman.
Eating nothing but manna has destroyed your good sense.
The desert sun has rotted your brain.
Perhaps, but not my heart.
Or my faith.
My trust is in the Lord... my love is for God.
Can you say the same, Nahbi?
Are you so righteous that you'd risk our lives?
I claim no special righteousness, only devotion to the words of God.
You've spent too long yapping at Moses' heels like a faithful lap dog.
It's time you thought for yourself.
He does.
As do I.
And we know that the land God promised us lies within our reach.
Try it and the Hittites will slice your hand off.
They are mighty people, armed, fortified... and 10 times our number.
And if the Lord is with us, he will bring us there.
Like lambs to slaughter.
How can you doubt God?
Look how far he's brought us.
Yes, look how far.
Through a desert to a wilderness.
We've seen brother kill brother because of the golden calf.
Every step of the way he has tested us over and over.
Perhaps this is yet another trial, one that only few will survive.
- Yes.
- Korah speaks the truth.
This so-called Promised Land is already home to Hittites, Jebusites.
What good is a land of milk and honey... if only a handful live to enjoy it?
Moses, is this another test?
How can I know that?
All I can tell you is what the Lord commanded.
We go forward into the land he promised our forefathers.
I follow his word without question.
Then perhaps it is time for a new leader.
One who cares enough about the safety of Israel... to know God's answers to these questions.
- A new leader?
- Yes.
It is not too late to save ourselves.
Better to go back to Egypt... than to die here or on an Amalekite sword.
Far better.
At least there we knew what each day would bring.
A new leader.
We've gone far enough with Moses and Aaron.
The only place they have brought us to is one of hardship and suffering.
The hardship and suffering you brought upon yourself.
- You sinned against the Lord.
- Sinned?
Listen, oh, Israel.
Moses always tells us it's our fault.
I stand with Korah.
I say we anoint a new leader.
One who will take us back to Egypt and save us from destruction.
Look, they draw weapons.
Is this killing of one another never to end?
How many more of us must die?
Stone them.
The Lord has spoken.
Hear his words.
Ten times we challenged him... and ignored his bidding.
Yet even now... he will spare you.
All of the men who have lived 20 years or more will die in this desert.
For 40 years... one for each da y that his servants scouted that land... those who spoke against him... will wander and die.
When the last of those who spurned God ar e fallen... then he will take their childr en... into that country given by his oath... to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Of those who spoke... only Joshua and Caleb... will live to occupy that land... for they alone wer e of a differ ent spirit.
- All is as it should be, Aaron.
- Good.
Then we have a home again.
A temporary one, of course.
How long before the Promised Land, Aaron?
This drought is hurting us.
Moses says only weeks away.
So let us pray that our water lasts.
- Let me.
- No need, I'm not dead yet.
- Get about your business.
- But I can help.
You're too clumsy.
Men aren't able to do this kind of work.
Moses, Aaron, it's Miriam, come quickly.
Miriam.
Speak to me.
Oh, no, Lord.
Not Miriam.
Miriam my sister.
Miriam, the light of my family.
Not now!
Not this close to home!
Sleep gently, sister.
And glory in God's goodness.
Without water, we'll all follow her to the grave, and quickly.
No!
Which one of you said that?
Even at my sister's burial you complain?
Can't I even grieve without hearing your whining?
Moses, they meant no harm, they simply...
They simply worry for themselves.
As if the Lord hasn't proven he'll care for their every need.
We feel for your grief... but our animals will soon die of thirst, we only ask...
You only!
You ignore all that God does for you, and you whine and you want.
Where's the wonder at what you already have?
Where's the wonder?
Moses, come.
We must ask for God's hand in this matter.
Come, let us ask God's hand.
Come.
Now kneel to God.
Dear Lord... the people need water.
You satisfied now?
What do you mean?
- God did not speak to me.
- He spoke to me.
Go on out of my way.
I command you... to yield water to the people.
Yield!
There, I've given you water.
I heard your call, Lord.
I'm here.
Yes.
I did.
I lacked faith.
I should have waited upon you, Lord.
It was my anger, Lord... my arrogance.
Moses.
Miriam?
You forget... brother, Miriam has passed on.
Ah, yes.
Has the time come for me to join our beloved sister Miriam?
That hour is known only to God.
But Canaan is within grasp.
Yes.
We saw... and lived miracles.
Did we not, my brother?
The calf.
Will God remit my sins?
Surely.
He already has.
Moses, what can I do?
How do I help you?
By taking the torch from my hands, Joshua.
Just as God decreed.
You and I will journey... to Mount Nebo tomorrow.
- Mount Nebo?
- To the top of Pisgah.
But before that... you must be commissioned, Joshua.
God has named you... to be in authority after me.
I have asked the Lord...
God of the spirits of all flesh... to appoint someone over the congregation... who shall go out before them and come in before them... who shall lead them out and bring them in... so that the congregation of the Lord shall not be like... sheep without a shepherd.
And the Lord said, "Take Joshua...
"for he is a man in whom dwells the spirit.
"Lay hands upon him...
"and commission him. "
Be strong and bold... for you shall lead the Israelites into the land the Lord promised them.
God will be with you.
Sit me down on a rock, Joshua.
The land the Lord promised... is just on the other side of this mountain.
Yes, Moses, and we are ready.
God has said to me:
"This is the land...
"I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying...
"'I will give this to your descendants. "'
You have achieved the great task the Lord put before you.
The Lord... also said this to me:
"Moses...
"you may view the land from a distance...
"but you shall not enter it. "
This cannot be.
You are the servant of the Lord.
God has said this to me.
Surely if you plead with God, he will hear you.
I have.
No, Joshua.
- This is as it should be.
- Why?
Because I was arrogant.
I struck the rock twice for God's water.
I did not trust God... to reveal his holiness before the eyes of the people.
But, Moses...
It was my anger speaking... and God cannot turn his eyes from that.
God cannot build... a nation on anger.
I'm... going... up the mountain now.
I shall not come down again.
- No, I'll come with you.
- No, no.
This is as it should be.
God is calling me home... now... to be with him forever.
The people must follow you now, Joshua.
You are beloved of God... but the land of Canaan is only promised, Joshua.
Every inch will be a struggle.
You must now build a new Israel... based on the love of the law... not blind obedience to it.
You have the people well-organized.
- Are they ready to cross Jordan?
- More than ready.
Anxious to follow God's word.
Rejoice... for I have accomplished my task.
It's for you now... to complete God's will.
My job is finished.
God's will be done.
The Promised Land.
Remember what Moses... the servant of God, instructed you.
Beyond lies Canaan, the land promised our forefathers.
For the second time, the Lord bids you... go forth!
Fr om Jericho to Shechem... the Lord led Israel into the land he had pr omised their for efathers.
And at Shechem...
Joshua placed a stone at the foot of the sacr ed oak... and said:
"Let this stone be a witness against us...
"if ever we br eak faith with God. "
And the childr en of Israel... ended their wandering.

I'm here, your Majesty.
I had a game made for you Great Egypt.
Speak up, Moses, I can't hear you!
A...
A game.
This is very fine woodwork, Moses.
I didn't know that you were so good with your hands.
No...
Great Egypt.
I did not make the game my self.
It was made by a Hebrew craftsman... at my request... especially for you.
A Hebrew!
I have never been very skilled with games, Moses.
-Are you?
-No, Great Egypt.
Moses is too humble, Great Egypt.
He defeats me in riddles quite often.
You let him win, Tuntmim.
Just as you do with me.
Never!
Are you good at riddles, my son?
I have one for you, father.
When is a Egyption, not an Egyption?
I don't know my son.
When?
Oh, I'm sorry I've forgotten the answer, Father.
Then it's not a good riddle, is it?

Ask it again!
Yes, Father.
And now my gift for you.
It's wonderful!

No, Aaron if they see me lying here they will beat me..
-Just rest!
-Lazy Hebrew... will it take a beating to make you work?
No!
-You dare interfere, Hebrew!
No, leave him.

Moses!
You shouldn't come here!
You say this every time I come... and every time your eyes tell me what a terrible liar you are.

They won't bother you..
They won't bother you..
Get up!
Up!
Get up!
How are you?
I'm well, Moses.

-And you?
-Oh, I want for nothing....
-except...
-Except?
I have to go.
Expect me tonight..
Goodbye, Moses.
Work!
Lazy workers.
Quicky!
Come on
You're not Hebrew, Moses.
You sucked at the breast of a Hebrew, nothing else.
You are an Egyptian prince, Moses.
Be proud!
Why?
Because Egyptians are powerful?
No!
Because it's what you are.
I'm not Egyptian, or Hebrew...
I'm nothing.
Moses!
Don't speak this way!
Or you shall offend the gods!
Which gods?
UH!
That gods you teach me to worship?
Or the god that Jachabed loves?
Jachabed was your wet nurse, nothing more!
She lies if she says she was more.
She tells me nothing more.
But I know the truth..
The truth is that I am your mother... and you are a royal Prince of Egypt.
I am nothing!
The Pharoah knows it, the court knows it... the nation knows.
only you pretend, mother.
Good night.
Keep moving.
I want to get home.
You thought were going to get away with it?
-No, master I meant no harm...
-You made me look like a fool!
No!
Moses!
You killed him!
You killed an Egyptian!
Aaron!
Keep diging her.
It's not deep enough.
Come on.
quickly!
Hurry up!
-quickly
-We have to go.
Cover him.
You saved my Iife.
Why?
Why?
You're my brother, Aaron.
God be with you, Moses.
What do you want here?
-I want to see my mother.
-Moses, no.
You don't belong here.
You are an Egyptian.
Aaron!
I came to see my mother.
Moses, no.
I am here, my son.
Mother.
Forgive me, Moses!
It was my only way to save you from the sword of Ramses.
I am Hebrew.
You are whatever you choose to be, Moses..
God has given you a choise he has given to no other man.
And I have taken it away!
What do you mean?
And why?
Why are you wearing this rough cloak?
-I am leaving Egypt.
-Leaving...
Tonight.
Didn't Aaron tell you?
Aaron?
I have so many questions.
But now...
I must go.
God saved you, Moses.
Serve him well.
fill the trough!
Drive the flock forward!
But Zipporah... father said not to look for trouble!
He doesn't have to wait until the men are through!
They have struck us before, Zipporah, they'II do it again.
fill the trough!
Come, come!
Let's go!
See how fortunate we are!
.
The priest's daughters have filled the trough for our flock!
You are mistaken!
The water is for my father's flock!
really?
well...
Jethro's sheep can wait..
Perhaps.
But my sister and I can't.
Drive the flock forward.
Do as I say!
I... may I drink at your well?
Thank you...
If you would drink, you'd better ask my permission.
Nobody makes a fool of me.
You ignore me at your peril, stranger!
Now there's no point strutting for the sisters!
-You're one and we are four.
-What's your name, Shepherd?
Midan, what is yours?
Moses, son of Ptira, daughter of Ramses.
Ramses...
Look inside my cloak.
My cloak.
Egyptian?
It's Egyptian army.
I serve Ramses himself.... his army can probably be seen from the top of that ridge.
They'II need lambs to eat.
Now shall we taken yours or those of the women?
Move the sheep!
Move the sheep!
Quick!
Quick!
Move it.
Come on Move it!
What did you say to him that made him so afraid?
You are shaking, yet you're brave.
Why?
-I was not brave.
-You were brave.
Why?
I was angry, Sometimes...
well...he knocked you down.
That was wrong.
My father is Jethro.
He is the priest of Midian
He will be grateful.
well...
I'II be on my way.
Oh!
But my father?
No!
It's best!
Go well.
You're back soon!
?
.
Father!
Father...
An Egyptian stopped Midian from taking our place at the trough.
An Egyptian?
Or a gang of them?
No, Father just one..
But a very brave one.
Is that him?
He deserves a show of gratitude!
I asked him to stay, Father, but...
Go fetch him, daughter!
What a great pleasure for me to have another man at my table!
My life is surrounded by women!
A father needs a son amongst his family..
You saw today at the well.
We live in a time of rough men... with little respect for women.
I am a priest to the people of Midian which...
lies just-beyond the ridge.
What gods do you worship, Moses?
In Egypt we have many gods.
The Hebrew slaves have only one.
Yes.
You know of him?
Is he above other gods?
I haven't heard much of his power for many years.
My wetnurse... my Hebrew wetnurse ... she says that he will deliver them from slavery.
From Egyptians?
That would be an act of great power.
You are a man of many fascinating thoughts and ideas.
But not many words!
It would be worth our while to persuade you... to stay for a time
There's no better kitchen in the entire region!
Zipporah makes sure of that!
And no one weaves finer fabric than we do.
also under Zipporah's eye de Sefora.
They exaggerate, Moses.
I'm sure, it's all true.
AII of it.
But I, must be on my way.
East?
mostly barren land..
What towns do exist rarely welcome strangers
Why not stay here?
until you have a better idea of where you're headed?
-Oh please stay Moses!
-please stay, please!
You're very kind, but...
Good!
That's agreed!
Foi bom ter ficado aqui.
A full day has passed since...
Pharoah has show any sign of mortal spark.
Let Egypt rejoice!
My father... rejoined the gods of the other world.
Give thanks to the great Pharoah.
The Sun and Moon live in him.
Rise.
Tuntmin, you may look upon me.
Egypt's people shall mourn for one full phase of the moon... while the holy embaImers prepare my Father... for his journey to the other world.
As it is said, so shall it be done.
Then I shall take my place on the sun throne
As it is said, so shall it be done.
Good!
Let the mourning begin.
-Have you counted them?
-I have.
-Every one?
-Every one.
Dried lamb, bread dates and your water.
-Is that enough for you?
-Oh for two or three days.
I'II see them settled for summer grazing.
-Take care!
-I will, I will.
Beware of the wolves!
I will.
Yes, Yes, you've lost your mum, you've lost your Mama.
Came here.
I will take care of you.
Strange...
No lightning.
Let's go and see.
C'mon let's go and see!
You burn but the flames... don't consume you?
.
Moses!
Moses.
Here I am.
Remove your sandals...
For the place where you stand is holy ground.
Be at peace.
I am the god of your fathers...
Abžraham, of Isaac and of Jacobž.
God!
Why did you come to me?
I have heard the cry of my people, Israel.
I will send you to the Pharoah.
And you shall free my people from Egypt.
Why me ?
A man clumsy with words.
Who am I to go before the Pharoah?
I will bže with you.
If I go to the israelites... and say, God has sent me, they won't believe me.
They'II ask what is his name?
I am who I am.
They won't listen !
Why should they!
?
They will seek signs.
That rod, cast it on the ground.
Grasp it bžy the tail.
Now, put your hand under your cloak.
Now withdraw it.
No, no.
Now replace your hand, and then withdraw it.
This will bže the sign... that you speak with the voice of the Lord their God.
please, Lord.
Not me... not me, not me,
I've never been a man of world, not in past time not, not now and even... as you speak to me.
I'm, I'm...
I'm slow...
I'm slow of speech!
Your bžrother Aaron will meet you.
And you will bže my voice to him... and he will speak for you to the people.
Jethro!
Jethro!
Moses!
Maybe I was dreaming or mad from the sun...
Or perhaps God spoke to you.
-Why would God choose me?
-Why not you?
Because I don't know God!
I know nothing about god!
In Egypt they have many gods.
Which God spoke to you?
The God of de Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But you are Egyptian.
No, I'm Hebrew.
I had two mothers.
I came from the womb of Jochabed, a Hebrew slave.
But I was raised up by Ptira... daughter of Ramses himself.
Ramses?
Both mothers.... spoke to me of God.
But...
I have yet to find my God.
And I can't find him!
.
I can't find him!
God... can speak to any one...
-he knows your heart.
-Even a murderer?
Does he speaks to murderer?
Does he know the heart of a murderer?
What are you saying?
Moses!
In Egypt I killed a man.
It's why I ran.
It's why I came here.
They.... killed... so many of them... of us!
An I survived...
An I kill!
I know nothing of this.
But I do know...
God speaks for a purpose.
You have heard your God's voice..
Did I?
Are you mad?
Are you mad?
No!
You are not.
Your heard the voice!
God has spoken to you
-Did he not give you a sign!
?
-Did he not change the staff...
-into a serpent, as you told us!
?
-As I told you.
- Then it was God!
.
- Was it!
Was it!
Was it!
Oh has he?
Was it?
Was it God?
What could be more real than the call of God?
What if it is true?
Can you live without testing the truth?
Did I see God, Zipporah?
only you can answer that, Moses!
If I go back to Egypt... as the voice has commanded, they may kill me.
Not if God is with you
Not if he is sending you to free your people.
I can't even talk in the presence of the Pharoah
I can't talk!
It is a true call.
You must answer it.
They may kill your husband.
I will trust in God.
will you?
God be with you.
Aaron.
Aaron, my brother.
Oh Moses, how I missed you.
I'm here.
I'm here, I'm here.
What are you doing here, in the middle of the desert?
God called me to come to you.
God?
He spoke to me too.
I know..
slow down a bit.
Moses has returned.
-O Moses has come back.
-What are you doing?
I must let the people know you are here, Moses.
Why?
You are sent by God to free his people.
-But what if...
-Moses, blessed is the day God... chooses to free his people from bondage.
That day has come with arrival.
The people will want to know.
Moses... it has begun.
Moses has arrived!
Moses has returned!
Moses is God's messenger!
He has been chosen by God to...
lead his people out of bondage
behold the deliverer.
Moses.
Miriam.
Moses... my brother.
Miriam...
Moses come back as a messenger of God...
To free his people from the Egyptian bondage, come.
We'II show you.
Come!
Come!
Gather round all of you.
Come gather!
Moses has returned as God's messenger.
Gather around.
Witness the power of God through...
Moses.
Moses!
A few weeks ago I was on, Mount Sinai...
Speak up.
A few weeks ago I was on, Mount Sinai...
God...
The God of Abraham, Isaac e Jacob... came to me and asked me to return to Egypt... to lead you, his chosen people... out of bondage into a land of milk and honey.
Moses...
Moses, the Egyptian.
I was raised in a Egyptian family... but I am Hebrew by birth.
An Egyptian family?
You were raised by the daughter of the Pharoah himself!
I believe god asked me to return, to lead you out of slavery.
Do you?
Why do you believe this Egyptian?
Here is a sign God gave me.
The power of God is infinite.
magic trick!
No!
The hand of God.
And there is more.
These are the sign of God.
Moses has been called to lead us out of bondage.
And why would God call an Egyptian?
Moses is my brother, and you know it.
He is the son of our departed mother, Jochabed
-He was raised in the way of Egypt!
-Do you question God's ways?
These are the signs of God.
Proof that he has heard us.
Proof that he has come back to us.
Have we followed the way of Good through all this... to desert him when he hears us?
The Egyptians are a mercifully people.
My chief steward says , I should show you mercy.
But he is too soft.
Your tax will be paid or your life is forfeited.
Next.
Come forward.
plead before, Great Egypt.
You see, steward?
A steady hand, and complaints disappear.
Now if there's no more business...
Who are you to enter my court room?
I'II have your head.
I am Moses.
Moses?
But I knew a man by that name once.
But he left under the cover of night.
God has demanded my return.
So, adopted son of Egypt.
From time to time we wondered where you were.
In... distant lands.
Very...
distant, I'm sure.
I expected your return for Ptira entombment.
Out of gratitude to you Egyptian mother.
I knew nothing of her passing
And who is this?
I am Aaron, the Levite... brother of Moses,.
Great Egypt.
Great Egypt!
exactly right!
So how do you dare to come before me?
I do as Moses instructs, sire.
As Moses instructs?
Why did you not tell me, steward... that there are those other man than myself who... command the acts of people in my kingdom?
I had no idea there was another authority, sire.
May I be forgiven?
Moses...
How dare you show your face before me ?
It is not by choise, Pharoah.
I come only because the Lord... of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has asked me... to speak his message.
Do you hear , steward?
A wretch in shepherd's clothes... speaks of God great enough to decide to whom I, god-on-earth must give audience!
But your God... the God of israel has shown himself to us.
And these are his words.
He says...
"Let my people go... so they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness."
I should have you both killed, your for daring to come before me.
But your blood is unworthy of me
If Hebrew you must be, so be it.
Go Moses, take your brothers.
Live with the slaves!
Live there.
Then come back and speak to me of your God.
Steward?
Sire?
We can't have slaves dreaming of journeys to the wilderness!
Egypt needs their sweat!
Increase their workload!
Have them gather their own straw for the bricks that make.
Then demand the same number of bricks be made each day.
Then we'II see if deceitful promises distract them?
!
Who is their foreman?
You!
Zerak.
kneel before the steward of Great Egypt.
You failed to meet the prescribed quota of bricks today and yesterday.
We try, Master!
But now we have to gather our own straw.
As hard as we work the quota is never reached!
We want only to serve Great Pharoah.
Then explain why you sent him Moses to beg that you be... allowed three days in the wilderness?
I sent no one, Master.
I beg of you!
Ask Great Egypt to lift this burden!
You'II produce our quota of bricks Or you will be beaten.
-hold him.
-Guards.
Beat him.
I don't understand it.
I knew they wouldn't listen to me.
Why should God cause greater suffering?
More hardship?
Moses!
Look upon this, Prophet!
Moses plays us for fool .
There are no voices.
Look at him!
The false prophet.
It was not you under the lash!
Nor was it Moses.
The Pharoah lets Moses sit and watch while... the rest of us work until we die!
To make you jealous of him.
hold that sharp tongue, woman!
I'm sorry , Zerak.
I believe God spoke to me...
God called you, Moses.
Don't doubt.
If you are not convinced, then how are we to believe it?
Your doubts won't stop Zerak from plotting against you.
You'd better do something, brother.
quickly.
fill me with belief, Lord.
fill my arms, fill my hands, fill my tongue.
Again Moses!
Such insolence to look upon my face.
Why are you here?
Are you a part of my entertainment?
We come with the word of God.
Oh does he really?
well... that doesn't fit with my plans, Hebrew.
Ask him to wait, will you?
Are you... so sure I'm a full and a fake that you'd?
risk his wrath?
Risk!
Great Lord!
Now hear me!
For God fills my tongue.
The Lord of israel... bids you let his people go!
No one... no one bids Great Egypt, god-on-earth, anything!
Anything!
Nobody
Come here!
behold... the prince of Egypt.
Heir to the throne.
Heir of throne.
And now I must bathe in the nile.
As a gift of thanks, yes to Amun.
Stop.
Don't move.
Hear now the voice of the Lord God of israel.
He bids you let his people go!
blood.
blood.
There will be blood throughout the whole of Egypt for seven days.
The fish will die, the rivers will stink of death.
Through Moses, The Lord says...
"Know by this that I am the Lord."
The Lord bids Pharoah...
"Let my people go."
Or, he will faII upon with... pestilence and the sword.
No work today.
Rest!
Be at peace with your families!
Rest !
No work today for any of us.
The nile is undrinkable!
Every single Egyptian across the entire land is scratching... at the earth for water.
Moses...
Moses, you're right!
And surely now Pharoah will let us go!
Is it to be that simple?
well, isn't it?
God warn us, that Pharoah's heart is hard.
This won't be won easily.
Great Egypt!
Your priests have an answer.
Show me!
Great Lord.
You see!
The Hebrew trick is easily performed
And our agents in upper kingdom report that the water... of great NiIo, are now clean an sweet... as they flow down river, toward to us.
Before seven days have passed, this plague will be only a memory.
Good, put the Hebrew back to work.
They must make up for the work lost... by these games of Moses.
I suppose you and your God take credit for this?
If you do not believe this then why did you call us before you?
Lift this plague!
I'm tired of these games of your God plays.
will you let the Lord's people go?
Yes, Yes.
But lift this plague.
-No Lord.
-silence.
I want peace.
Get these frogs away take,... your people to the wilderness, for your sacrifice!
This is our day of freedom!
Praise be to God for him, Zerak.
We are leaving!
We are leaving!
Ready?
Let's go.
truly, Moses you are a prophet of God.
I never thought to see the day we would gone from Egypt.
-You will.
-Good!
You're going?
Going?
fools!
Did you think Pharoah would be compelled by a... silly trick?
To your labors.
To your labors!
You said Pharoah released us.
Traitor!
You lied Moses!
.
You lied.
-You lied!
Back to work.
AII of you.
This is your vanity.
This is your vanity.
You lied Moses!
You lie
The Lord must try israel even as he... affIicts the people of Egypt.
You charIatan!
,
I believed you Moses!
Vanity!
Moses, all your tricks will not convince me to... release Egypt's work force.
It is God's will...
That you let his people go.
And who will do the work?
Your God?
Moses... your people cannot survive in freedom... you know that.
You understand the system.
I cannot expect your brother here to understand... but you do, slaves are slaves, Moses.
They are happiest being slaves.
Thus says the Lord.
"Let my people so that they may worship me."
For now I couId have stretched out my hand... and struck you and your people... but I have let you live to show my power.
And to make my name resound through all the earth
My name resound through all the earth.
And I have let you live.
Moses let me put you in charge of the Jews?
You can look after them, you can care for them.
But they must stay.
They can worship who they like.
I've never interfered with their God!
Send everything that you have in an open field... to a secure place.
Every human and animal will die... when the hall comes.
hall!
hall!
We are in a desert, open the doors.
You are a madman, Moses...
Do not come before me again!
Do you hear me?
Never!
Never again.
If your powers are less than those of a slave Gods... what good is your services or your lives?
Great Egypt, what can be lost by allowing... them to worship In the wilderness?
because once there, They'II never return.
They'II move a horde Of people on... our eastern flanks, a threat to Egypt
But what greater threat can Egypt face than these plagues?
They're great magic, my Lord.
The omens tell us that... while we keep the Hebrews we.
- will have no peace.
-That is enough!
Enough!
Egypt is ruined!
The barley is in the ear...
The locusts will eat it all.
The hand of the Lord.
blessed be his name!
He is still upon us!
.
Moses, now will Pharoah's heart soften?
If God sees us ready for freedom.
If not, he will harden Pharoah's heart... and we will remain slaves.
We will leave this place... when Egypt finally understands the power of the lord.
You pray to him that you'II be ready for that day ..
When it comes.
God shall not harm IsraeIi's children.
You may go.
And all your people with you.
Egypt has decided it no Ionger desires...
You in our midst.
When the Lord lifts the disease from your body... will your heart harden again?
I want you gone...
all of you!
only your flocks and herds will remain.
The Lord bids all our possessions go with us.
How else will we have what we need to make sacrifice to him.
To show our thanks.
It is tome you owe your gratitude!
You go...
Your flocks remain.
AII of us.
Stop.
Our young, our old, Our flocks, our herds... or you will face a plague worse than anything... the Lord has thus far shown you.
Not one more word of this foolish God you... boast of.
If your flocks are so dear to you...
Stay with them!
Here!
In Egypt.
Think carefully on this.
How dare you instruct me?
Get out of my sight.
Be gone and take care never to look upon my face again.
For if I ever see Your face one more time...
I will kill you!
I will kill you!
How long, oh Lord?
How long?
And with this last...
The Lord will break the Pharoah's conceit...
And teach us the terrible price of freedom.
Mark well, now, what I say to you... on the tenth day of this month... each family will take a yearling lamb without blemish.
You'II watch over this lamb until the 1 4 day of the month... at which time the entire assemblage of israel will gather.
And at twilight on that day, you will slaughter the Iamb.
Take some of the lambs blood... and put it on the doorposts of your houses.
The lamb's blood will be a sign.
When the Lord sees the blood, he will pass over and you will... be not harmed ... when he strickes the land of Egypt
You will eat of the Iamb The same night.
But, it not must be raw... or cooked with water, only roasted.
You shall eat it with your clothes, and your staff in your hand.
You will not take time to leaven your bread.
This will be known as the feast of unleavened bread.
You will eat this pass over offering hurriedly for at midnight.
The Lord will punish the gods of Egypt.
And the Lord will see the gods of Egypt.
But the blood on the houses where you are will be a sing... for when he sees the blood he will pass over you.
No!
No!
Look what you have done to my son!
Your God is evil!
evil and powerful.
I who have never known fear... fear him.
Go away from my people.
tale your flocks!
Take your herds!
Then be gone.
Moses.
I have let you go.
Bring a blessing on me?
please!
Remember this night!
On which you came out of Egypt!
Out of the house of slavery.
Because the Lord brought you out... with the strength of his hands!
Go forth on israel.
Oh, israel... go forth !
The people wonder, Moses.
About what?
Why we take this route?
This leads to the Red Sea.
South lies a clear path ... to the east to the land of Canaan..
We take the route the Lord ordains.
Tuntmin!
What have I done...
letting israel leave our services?
I was a wise decision, Great Egypt.
-Were are they now?
-Approaching the sea...
They must pay for this.
Prepare a company of our army.
is this a game, Moses?
Did you bring us out of Egypt... so that we could swim to the promised land?
.
I have done as the Lord instructed.
You must do likewise.
Moses, they are coming!
The Egyptians.
With Pharoah at their head!
An army of soldiers!
and chariots!
Save us.
How far back?
How far behind are they?
-half a day.
-half a day?
half a day.
We will find a way.
Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have brought us here to die in the wilderness?
Better to have served them than to die in the desert.
The Lord has shown us the way.
If we follow it, he will deliver us.
-What's he doing?
-He is trying to...
Look.
Look!
Look!
Look... everybody!
Oh Lord!
holy is the Lord!
Thank you , Lord!
Look!
-Oh Lord
-Praised be the Lord!
AII hall the power of the Lord.
He has saved israel.
Thank you, Lord.
Come on!
Ahead!
Come on!
Ahead!
Death to any man who disobeys!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
he has triumphed!
The Lord is my strength... and my might.
This is my God... and I will praise him.
Who is like to Lord?
Who among the might?
In your steadfast love you...
led the people whom you redeemed...
You guided them with your strength.
The Lord will... reign forever and ever.
Yes.
Forever and ever!
Forever and ever!
Forever and ever!
Forever and ever!
Forever and ever!
Forever and ever!
Forever and ever!
Look at Moses up there.
-Nothing stops him.
-Speak up, EIiav.
My stomach's growling so loudly I cannot hear you.
Listen to you!
BIeating like a lamb waiting at the slaughter.
slaughter there will be if we don't eat soon.
well?
Did Lord fill any of your empty stomachs today?
Moses...
Did God lead us into the desert, to starve?
If it is God's will.
So be it.
Do you have a plan Moses?
or not?
I demand to know.
To follow God's will as always.
For us to starve in this godforsaken place?
Godforsaken?
God has shown you the way... and you call it godforsaken?
Your people are starving, Moses.
What are going to do about it?
did you follow this man into the desert starve?
truly, Moses is a great man, but... somewhere he has lost contact with God's will.
We must help him!
Look!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Come get it!
Hurry up!
Come!
Come!
Moses, Stop the fire.
Moses, help us!
Moses, help us
Moses, please Moses stop the fire!
Aaron!
Stop the fire!
Moses!
You have the power!
Praying won't help!
calm down.
Throw sand on the fire.
He can't help you now.
Praying won't help!
Do something!
help throw sand on the fire.
He cannot help you now.
Moses, help us.
help.
Stop the fire..
Senior...
Moses, stop the fire!
Moses!
Why do you lay the burden of all the people on me?
Did I conceive these people?
Did I gave birth to them?
I cannot carry all these people alone.
For... they are too heavy for me.
Throw sand!
Go ahead!
We must stopped this fire!
The people are waiting.
-For what?
-For God to feed them.
God didn't lead us here to die, Moses.
Go to your tents.
Don't come out until the morning.
God himself will provide bread.
Bread?
How?
There's not a stalk of grain within a month's journey!
Go into your tents.
Don't come out until morning.
Aaron...
Look!
What is this?
Eat is.
delicious.
delicious.
Like coriander seed.
Sister!
Gather it up.
Gather it up.
Man get some baskets and help to gather it up.
it is a gift from God.
We will call it Manna.
-Manna?
-Yes.
The bread that the Lord has given you to eat.
Every morning you will gather as much as needed for a day
You will receive this as a gift.
You'II take no more than is needed for a single day, because... each day the Lord will see to your needs.
if you lack faith in the Lord and take more, it will rot.
It will rot.
It will rot.
It will rot.
Now that you're free men, you may rest every seventh day.
This will be the Sabbath, and you will not have to work.
-Sabbath?
No work
-No work on the Sabbath?
-How can it be?
-You rest.
What does it mean?
God says to me... there is no work on the Sabbath.
You will rest.
You will not gather Manna on that day.
But on the sixth day you will take a double ration... which will not rot.
-No work, rest!
-Sabbath?
-No work?
-Rest?
Remember this the next time you grow impatient with God, Zerak.
Do you expect us to live on bread alone?
This day the Lord will send you meat.
Meat?
We haven't seen meat since we left Egypt.
The Lord will send you meat.
And you will eat until it... comes out of your nostrils.
AII right.
Jethro.
Jethro!
I have heard of all your God has done for you, Moses.
I had to come, see for my self.
God has been good to us.
- How is Zipporah?
-She is well.
I miss her.
She understands, Moses.
She understands.
-Liar!
-Such a liar.
You promised...
You must abstain for thirty days.
You are liar...
You must respect that.
Come closer.
Know in your heart that... as a parent, disciplines a child... so the Lord your God, must discipline you.
That all for today.
Moses must rest.
Tomorrow, tomorrow, Moses will hear your cases.
He must rest now, the sun is almost gone.
Why do you sit alone in judgment all day?
I make know to them, the statutes and.... instructions of God, as you have seen.
What I have seen is the people feeding off you... and you allowing it to happen.
You have allowed it to happen.
Do you not love your brother?
You have no right to ask such a question.
And you, none of you, have any right to let...
Moses be destroyed by his own people.
Look at him, He can hardly stand.
Is this how your God rewards his servant?
Jethro!
Your tongue's too sharp...
Jethro.
But, you speak the truth.
This task is too heavy for a single man, Moses?
You God did not mean for you, to be his only voice.
Aaron, was called also by God.
listen to me and I will... give you council for a change.
You must look for men who fear your God.
And set these men as officers over the people.
Let them settle the small matters... bring to you only the important ones.
Now, if you do this ... you will be able to endure... and these people will go home in peace.
I wonder why it is so hard to listen to ...
-someone speak the truth?
-Do I speak the truth?
How many times do you want me to say it?
You're a hard teacher, Jethro.
Yes, you speak the truth.
These people are still learning... to live without the Iaw of their slave masters.
God will reveal his law to us.
But will you be ready?
You can ask that?
We travel the wilderness trusting in God's plan every day.
You traded an Egyptian slave owner for a taskmaster in the heavens?
Profanity.
Laws are not sufficient by themselves.
The people must learn how to follow the Iaw without...
Moses, or any leader.
They must learn to want to follow... without fear of any whip on their backs... on their soul.
To follow the Iaw!
Because they are free not to.
When they learned that they will... truly be free.
until then, they are slave... are still slaves.
This is my dream, Jethro...
To no Ionger be needed.
You are a wise man Moses.
I'II begin by choosing God-fearing men tomorrow... tonight.
I'II begin by choosing, Aaron.
Thank you for your council.
Where will you go now Moses?
I believe god is leading us to Mount Sinai.
I wish you pure water and green grass.
As God wishes.
THREE MONTHS HAVE PASSED.
Mount Sinai!
Where God first spoke to me.
In the burning bush.
God is calling... me up there.
Do you think I'II make it, Joshua?
If God is calling you, Moses.
I wish he'd give me a better pair of sandals first.
Moses.
Moses!
Moses, is coming!
-Moses!
-Moses, is coming!
-Come on!
-Moses.
-Moses, Moses!
-Come on all!
Moses!
Hear now, oh israel!
Hear the words of the lord.
Here his law.
God says to you...
"You have seen what I did to the Egyptians... how I carried you on eagle's wind's and... brought you to me!
if you will be faithful to me and... heed my covenant you shall... be my treasure possession... amongst all peoples."
God says to you...
"AII the earth is mine... but you shall be to me a... kingdom of priest... and a holy nation.
If you will obey my law... and heed my covenant!
God says to you.
AII the words which the Lord, has spoken, we will obey.
-We will obey!
-GIadIy!
Did the Lord appear to you, Moses?
Do you wish to hear his, voice yourselves?
The people need to see that the... words is truly and not yours.
You doubt me , Zerak?
if you would Iike to hear the words of the Lord yourselves... then you must prepare... and consecrated .
Water, woman!
The Lord said to me...
"Have the people wash their clothes.
For three days they will, not lie with their wife .
Prepare for the third day... when I come up upon Mount Sinai, in the sight of the people.
Purify your hearts, not only your your robes..
For you wil be in the presence of God.
My task is almost complete, Aaron.
After today God will no Ionger need a mediator.
He'II speak directly to the people.
No, the people will always need a leader, Moses.
I'm not a Ieader.I'm an ordinary man who happened to be chosen.
But now that we are out of Egypt, through God's will and power.
My task is complete.
You stand assembled today before the Lord..... to God to enter into a covenant... which he is making with you.
In order that he may establish you as his people... and that he may be your God.
If you obey the commandment that God will give you today... then you will live and become... numerous then.... the Lord will bless you... in the land he has promised... to Abraham, Isaac and to Jacob.
God of Abraham!
We wait upon you!
Speak to us.
Moses!
Moses!
Do not let God speak to us!
Moses!
Moses!
Do not let God speak to us!
Do not be afraid!
We will surely die, Moses.
Do not be afraid.
It is your God.
You speak to us, we will listen.
No!
I am but a man.
If I can hear him so can you.
Do not be afraid.
Listen!
Listen to his voice!
You must hear him for us.
Moses!
please!
We will surely die!
israel... hear the word of the Lord!
The Lord has spoken and said:
"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of bondage!
You will have no other gods besides me!
Yes, master!
You will make no graven image... nor bow down nor serve any idol!
You will not swear falsely in the name of the lord!
-Remember the Sabbath day...
-Remember the Sabbath day...
-and keep it holy!
-and keep it holy.
Remember the Sabbath day.
Honor your Father and your Mother that you may stay long... in the land of the Lord your God will assign you!
You shall no murder!
You shall not commit adultery!
You shall not steal!
You shall not hear false witness against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbour's house... nor his wife nor anything that is your neighbour's!
The Lord has spoken.
He has pronounced his law!
The law of his covenant!
Do you hear, oh israel!
?
-Yes, Moses.
-Do you hear, oh israel?
Yes Moses.
Moses, Moses!
Moses!
help us, Moses!
I must go back up the mountain... for God wishes to give you...
His law.
You will stay here.
You will remain pure while you wait for my return.
Stay pure to receive the Iaw...
He wiII-send-down.
Joshua!
Joshua, come with me!
Come with me!
Purify your soul.
You have my blessing.
Purify your soul.
Joshua.
This is madness!
Thirty days of nothing.
He had no food when he left.
Thank you, Korah.
Do I Iook so awful that my presence makes you silent?
-We were just gossiping.
-Stop it, Korah!
tell the man the truth!
After all, isn't he the brother of Moses?
So surely you can speak openly to me.
Moses has been gone four phases of the moon!
Thirty days on Mount Sinai.
-Long time without any food.
-What do you want me to do?
Go up after Moses?
-You know that's impossible.
We were told to wait and to keep pure.
Keep pure!
We wash three times a day!
But for what?
Not for what, Zerak!
But for who!
?
We'II do as Moses said and wait!
Easy to say but hard to enforce!
Aaron.
You do not shall to do this.
-You didn't do it this.
-It's not Iike t hat...
people are nervous, restless.
You must do something
-Aaron?
-My turn.
We do nothing more than Moses instructed.
Have you forgotten your fear at the storm?
No!
Of course not!
So we'II do as we promised, and wait.
For how long?
Wait!
Wait a minute please.
Listen!
Wait.
Listen!
-please, listen.
Listen.
-Let he speak, please.
silence!
For the love of all you hold holy.
silence!
32 days since Moses went up the mountain.
No sign of him.
Are we to wait here forever?
Did we come up from Egypt to be abandoned in t he desert?
-No.
No.
.
-Then go back.
always the same threat!
Are those the only choices left to us... blind obedience to Pharoah... or even blinder obedience to an old man... who's probably perished in the wilderness of Mount Sinai?
You right.
absolutely right.
Have you a third option, Zerak?
Yes.
-Stopping relying on Moses.
-Yes!
We don't even know what has become of him.
Let us find our own way of . seeking God
Fashion our own tribute to God.
We will fashion his image with our own hands... so that we can see Him, touch Him.
You heard the voice of the Lord yourself.
He commanded us to have no idols.
Not an idol, Aaron.
A tribute fashioned... from the best gold, the best precious metals.
It can be our guide out of this wilderness.
-He is right.
-silence!
Don't listen to them!
God has been our savior so far.
He will remain with us if we're true to His word.
Yes... but...
How long before you'II admit Moses that has died... that he perished on Mount Sinai?
Moses is not dead.
only your faith in God...
-is dead.
-hold your tongue, woman.
The people need something to believe, Aaron.
Yes, Aaron now!
But a Graven image...
A symbol!
A guide to show the way!
How long must we wait?
Yes!
-Seven days...
-Why seven days?
-Seven days.
-Give him seven days.
By then, Moses will return.
I'm sure of it.
Waiting seven days...
Aaron!
Aaron!
Do you have any doubt in Moses' return?
Are you ready to abandon the Lord's word this easily?
I said seven day, Miriam and seven day it's been...
Aaron!
They'II do what they want, you know that.
Aaron!
We have discussed this among ourselves, Aaron.
We have waited the seven days.
It's time for us to take matters into our own hands.
On your head be it, Zerak.
He's seen the truth!
Gather up all your gold and gems.
Your earrings and bracelets.
Prepare the smiths metal workers.
blessed be this symbol, the great force that led us out to Egypt.
We consecrate your image... and ask you that you be with us now.
Great the birth of this image of the almighty.
celebrate its presence in our midst.
celebrate!
celebrate!
Is this how you serve God in my absence?
I'm not Iike you, brother.
I'm... a weak man.
We thought you were dead, Moses.
What else were we to think?
The word of the Iaw... the hand of the God!
A path... to lead you out of the wilderness... of your own hearts.
No, Moses, no!
If that was the word of god, Moses... it was easily shattered.
Can't you see!
?
Moses can't lead us out of here.
Let the calf go ahead of us... and let the other tribes see our wealth and power.
You have broken God's covenant.
It lies on the ground before you.
Those of you who would still choose to be with God... come stand by my side.
Now.
My brothers... sons of Levites.
Have you come this far only to turn your back on the Lord!
Come stand with us!
Stand with your tribesmen!
Now.
Are you fools!
?
Do you wish to die in the desert?
Stand with me and we will take our own freedom!
Those of you who would be with God... stand with me!
Those of you who would be delivered from the wilderness... stand with me!
We'II break camp in the morning.
The calf will lead us!
You're a fool, Moses.
We'II go on our own way!
There's nothing you can do about it.
Let them... waste!
Moses...
Thus says the Lord:
"Whosoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book".
Do God's work.
Furify israel!
Moses!
No!
You will grind the idol into dust!
You will put it in the water!
You will drink your evil ways... and taste its bitterness.
-Where are you going?
-To seek God's forgiveness.
Maybe I can make atonement for your sins.
Moses!
It's Moses!
Lord!
See the blood of the covenant... the Lord has made with you!
Look upon your work.
israel.
This will be your sanctuary.
The place for meeting God.
The Lord bless you and keep you.
The Lord make his face to shine upon you!
Shine and be gracious to you!
The Lord lift up his countenance upon you... and give you peace.
Ten days since we left Sinai and still no end to this wandering.
And nothing to eat but this daily portion of manna!
Fish!
Do you remember the feast days in Egypt?
When we ate fish till we burst?
There was a richness of food there.
Even vegetables
But they were only given to us at Pharoah's pleasure.
But at Ieast it was given to us.
Is that how you wish to live, Miriam?
Eating or starving at another man's whim?
I travel the desert at my brother's whim!
D'you think I'm so arrogant that I decide the fate of israel?
Do you think it was me who brought you out of Egypt?
No, I think it was all of us.
Has the Lord spoken only through you, Moses?
Mirian...
Didn't god call you to the wilderness to meet Moses?
It was you who gave the Lord a voice in front of the Pharoah.
Has God spoken only though Moses?
Mirian?
How can you say such a thing?
-He seeks no glory.
-You stay out of this.
Mirian!
AII this wandering is so aimless.
surely God knows the route to the land.
He's promised us!
And when he sees we're ready, He'II deliver us there.
-We're not ready?
-well, do you?
If God brought us to Canaan tomorrow would we know what to do?
would we be able to see His law is being followed?
could we...
organize ourselves?
A kingdom of priests and a holy nation!
We have wealth in our children... and a desire to settle on our land.
-What more do we need?
-Brotherhood.
A willingness to serve more than our own stomachs.
Mirian, stop.
please, stop.
-Mirian!
-Be still.
-please!
-What is it, Mirian?
hold still!
Leprosy.
Oh, Lord!
Do not punish her for a sin she has so foolishly committed.
Do not let her be consumed.
Lord please heal her.
Lord forgive her.
Lord don't do that.
God says she must be shut out of the camp for seven days.
After this time she may brought it again.
She will be healed then.
Take her!
God is being merciful.
unclean!
unclean!
unclean!
It's Moses, Mirian.
I've brought you some food.
-Stay away, Moses.
-I'm not afraid.
And you have to eat something.
Go away!
please!
-Go away!
-No.
Why are you doing this?
You are my sister.
I'm sorry you thought me so arrogant.
I spoke in anger, and god has punished me.
God talks to me.
Miriam... just as I am talking to you.
I don't deserve his presence.
Why did God choose me?
don't let my sin punish booth of us.
God has chosen you and...
I am your sister... and that's God's will.
-Rejoice!
.
-Rejoice!
AII this will be over.
We will journey to the promised land.
AII of us together.
So beautiful, Moses!
What a Land!
truly, Moses, we should never have doubted you.
There is the promised land.
We should never have doubted you.
You should always question me, Korah.
Never the word of the Lord.
As he promised us, so it shall be.
When will the Lord appear to lead us forward?
-He won't.
-What?
Look at our numbers!
Are we expected to simply walk into Canaan and occupy it?
How else will it be delivered into our hands?
surely the Lord will do it for us!
We must act for ourselves, EIiav, if we are to be a free people!
Joshua, select twelve men, one from each of the tribes of israel.
Lead them across the plain into Canaan.
Look closely at everything you see.Then return with news.
caleb from the tribe of Judah!
Sammua.
Nahbi.
Kabed, MieI...
We will all die if we try to occupy this land.
So Nahbi... are you too scared... to lead us to the land God promised Abraham, Isaac and Jacob?
I won't lead my family to a certain death or enslavement.
God will be with us!
He will lead!
Be reasonable Joshua!
We've spent forty days here!
And you saw the same things we saw!
The cities are heavily fortified.
And the people are strong.
And they are so many, Joshua.
You think they have power against... the strength of the god who delivered us from Egypt... and destroyed the Pharoah's army?
would you risk the life of your children on it, Joshua?
Where the Lord leads there is no risk!
Come!
Madness, Joshua!
Madness!
You're talking like a madman.
Eating nothing but manna has destroyed your good sense.
The desert sun has rotted your brain.
Perhaps!
But not my heart!
Or my faith!
My trust is in the Lord, my love is for God!
Can you say the same, Nahbi?
Are you so righteous that you'd risk our lives?
I claim no special righteousness!
only devotion to the words of God.
You've spent too long yapping at Moses's heel like a faithful dog.
No, no!
It's time you thought for yourself.
He does!
As do I.
And we know that the land God promised us...
lies within our reach!
Try it!
And the Hittites would slice your hand off!
They are mighty people!
Armed, fortified and ten times our number.
And if the Lord is with us he will bring us there!
Like lambs to slaughter!
How can you doubt God?
Look how far he's brought us!
Look how far!
Through the desert to a wilderness.
We've seen brother kill brother because of the golden calf!
Every step of the way he has tested us over and over.
This is yet another trial, one that only few will survive!
-Korah speaks the truth.
This so called Promised Land... is already home to the Hittites, Jebusites.
What good is a land of milk and honey... if only a handful live to enjoy it?
Moses is this another test?
How can I know that?
I tell what .the Lord commanded.
We go forward into the land he promised our forefathers.
I follow his word without question.
Then perhaps it is time for a new leader!
One who cares enough about the safety of israel... to know God's answers to these questions!
-A new leader.
-Yes!
It's not too late to save ourselves.
Better to go back to Egypt than die or on an AmaIekite's word?
At least there we knew what each day would bring.
A new leader!
We've gone far enough with Moses and Aaron.
They cause us only hardship and suffering.
No!
Hardship and suffering you brought upon yourselves.
-You sinned against the Lord.
-Sinned?
Listens sons of israel?
Moses always tell us it's our fault.
I stand with Korah!
I say we anoint a new leader.
One who will take us back to Egypt.
And save us from destruction!
Me!
Look they draw weapons!
Is this killing of one another never to end?
Oh, Lord!
The Lord has spoken.
Hear his words.
Ten times we challenged him... and ignored his bidding!
Yet even now he... will spare you!
AII of then men who have lived twenty years or more... will die in this desert.
-Keep moving!
-Forward!
For forty years... one for every day that His servants scouted that land.
Those who spoke against him will wander and die.
When the Iast of those who spurned God are fallen... then he will take their children... into that country given by his oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
Of those who spoke... only Joshua and caleb will live to occupy... that land for they alone were of a different spirit.
FORTY YEARS HAVE PASSED.
AII is as it should be, Aaron.
Good.
then we have a home again.
A temporary one, of course.
How long before the Promised Land, Aaron?
This drought is hurting us.
Moses says only weeks away.
So let us pray that our water lasts.
-Here!
Let me...
.
-No need!
I'm not dead yet!
Get about your business!
But I can help...
You're too clumsy.
Men aren't able to do this kind of work.
Moses!
Aaron!
It's Miriam!
Come quickly!
Speak to me, Miriam!
Miriam?
Not now, Lord not Miriam.
Miriam, my sister...
Miriam... the light of my family.
Not now.
Not this close to home!
sleep gently, sister.
And glory in God's goodness.
Without water we'II all follow her to the grave.
No!
Which one of you said that?
Even at my sister's burial you complain?
Can't I even grieve without hearing your whining?
Moses... they meant no harm...
-they simply...
-Worry for themselves.
We feel for your grief, Moses.
But our animals will soon die of thirst.
We only ask...
You ignore all that God does for you... and you whine and you want!
Where's the wonder at what you already have?
Where's the wonder?
Moses.
Come must ask for God's hand in this matter.
Let us ask God's hand!
Come!
Come!
Now and kneel to God.
Dear Lord... the people need water.
Water.
-Are you satisfied now?
-What do you mean?
God did not speak to me.
-He spoke to me.
-Moses...
Get out of my way!
I command you to yield water to the people.
yield!
yield!
There's nothing you can do for him.
I have given you water!
I heard your call, Lord.
I am here.
Yes.
I did.
I lacked faith.
I should have waited upon you Lord.
It was my anger, Lord.
My arrogance.
Moses...
Miriam?
you forget, brother...
Miriam has passed on...
Has the time come for me to join... our beloved sister, Miriam?
That hour is know only to God.
But...
Canaan... is within... grasp?
Yes.
We saw... and lived... miracles..
did we not my brother?
The calf, Moses, the calf... will God remit my sins?
surely, He already has.
Moses.
What can I do?
How do I help you, Moses?
By taking the torch from my hands, Joshua..
Just as God decreed.
Moses.
You and I will journey... to Mount Nebo tomorrow.
-Monte Nebo?
-To the top of the Pisgah.
But before that... you must be commissioned, Joshua.
God has named you to be in authority after me.
Be ready.
I have asked the Lord... god of the spirits of all flesh... to appoint someone over the congregation... who shall go out before them and come in before them... who shall lead them out and bring them in... so that the congregation of the Lord shall not be like... sheep without a shepherd.
And the Lord said, " take Joshua... for he is a man in whom dwells the spirit."
"Lay hands upon him... and commission him."
Be strong and bold... for you shall lead the israelites... into the land the Lord promised them!
God will be with you!
Sit me down on a rock, Joshua.
The land the Lord promised... is just on the other side of this mountain, Joshua.
Yes, Moses.
And we are ready.
God has said to me:
"This is the land that I swore to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying...
I will give this to your descendants."
You have achieved the great task the Lord put before you.
The Lord... also said this to me:
"You may view the land from a distance... but you shall no enter it."
This cannot be!
you are the servant of the Lord.
God has said this to me.
surely if you plead with god, he will hear you.
I have...
No, Joshua, this is as it should be.
Why?
Because I was arrogant, Joshua.
I... struck the rock twice for God's water.
I did not trust God to reveal... his holiness before the eyes of the people.
-But, Moses...
-It was my anger speaking...
And God cannot turn his eyes from that.
God cannot build a nation on anger.
I... going up... the mountain now, Joshua.
I shall not come down again.
-I will come with you .
-No, no.
this is as it should be.
God is calling me home... now.
to be with him forever..
The people must follow you now.
You are beloved of God.
But... the land of Canaan is only promised, Joshua.
Every inch will be a struggle.
You must now build a new israel based on the love of... the Iaw, not blind obedience to it.
You have the people well organized.
Are they ready to cross Jordan?
More than ready.
Anxious to follow God's word.
Rejoice.
For I have accomplished my task.
It's fro you now to complete God's will..
My job is finished.
God's will be done.
The Promised Land!
Remember what Moses... the servant of God, instructed you!
Beyond lies Canaan, the land promised our forefathers.
Now, for the second time... the Lord bids... you go forth!
Go forth!
From Jericho, to Shechem... the Lord led Israel into the land he... had promised their forefathers.
And at Shechem...
Joshua placed a stone... at the foot of the sacred oak and said:
"Let this stone be a witness against us... if ever we break faith with God."
And the children of Israel ended their wandering.
(lecturer) He died for love.
Born just after the Civil War, Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves, an artist by trade.
A wealthy landowner commissioned him to paint the portrait of his daughter.
They fell in love.
She became pregnant.
Her father had his thugs chase the poor man through the town.
When they caught him, they sawed off his right hand with a rusty blade.
A nearby beehive was raided, and the honeycomb smeared over his bleeding, mutilated body.
The crowd that had gathered fled as the bees came for him.
He died for love.
His resurrection began as rumor, and grew into myth.
Say his name five times in the mirror and he would appear.
A hook had replaced his severed hand.
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.
The myth has traveled from place to place, taking root in the most desperate areas.
Even here, in New Orleans, murders have been committed in his name.
Yes, but is he real?
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1992.
Helen Lyle becomes so obsessed by the myth that she takes on the persona of Candyman, killing her victims with a hook.
Cabrini residents believe she was the Candyman.
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?
I believe in the myth.
But the fact?
The flesh and blood?
No.
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman.
Well, that is a relief.
My publisher would never have forgiven me.
Imagine the headlines:
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated with Hook on Book Tour."
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet our Candyman, Peter.
- (crash) - (cat meows)
Oh, I'm sorry.
These streets have got me all turned around.
We were a little shy back there, were we?
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".
Ethan Tarrant.
Ethan, I'm sorry about what happened to your father.
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea
- how many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.
I'm not saying he was.
You told him there was no Candyman.
You told him to say the name - and now he's dead.
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.
Daniel Robitaille has been dead and buried for a very long time.
He's here.
You called him.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
You're next, Purcell.
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.
Give me a shot of single malt.
Fucking murderer!
Hey!
Get him the fuck outta here!
You're next, Purcell.
Get out!
It's... my book.
# WBOV
(radio) Are you with me, New Orleans?
Do ya hear me?
This is the Kingfish coming to you at 96.2 FM.
Anointed and appointed.
Just three more days, Crescent City, three days until Lent.
So let's have it, the merriment before the penance, and the feast before the fast.
The Kingfish gonna keep y'all company all the way down.
Hey, brothers and sisters, y'all know what "carnival" means in Latin?
Well, the Kingfish went to the good schools, so he can tell you all about it.
"Carnival: farewell to the flesh."
That's what it means.
I like that a lot. "Farewell to the flesh."
Yeah, you right.
And farewell to all that flooding', as far as I'm concerned.
That's right.
Look at it.
The banks of the mighty Mississippi are ready to spill their seed.
Just look at that sky out there.
It's ready to rain on us again.
And the clouds?
Well, now, brothers and sisters, they're not the only thing threatening' the Crescent City.
We're talking murder, mes amis.
Cos so we've heard before, the hook man, kerchunk.
So when you pull on your costume and turn to admire yourself in the mirror, please keep those lips locked tight.
Do not call his name.
Is he always so angry?
Guess so.
- And why do you think that is?
- Cos he's been hurt.
"Cos he's been hurt"(!
)
Who hurt him, Matthew?
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie.
Look.
Come here.
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?
No way.
I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.
Why not?
It's not going anywhere.
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.
Annie, if there's one thing these kids understand, it's taking care of themselves.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.
Hey, Pam.
You movin' in here, or what?
No.
No, let's go.
- Howdy, Miss Tarrant.
- Hi, Greg.
(alarm)
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Oh!
Lord, I hate that thing.
- Then why leave it on all the time?
- Annie, please.
Don't start with me.
- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Ah!
Well, he barely even spoke to me.
He only wants to see you.
Oh, Annie.
I mean, murder.
(phone)
- Hello, Mrs. Tarrant.
- Is that what you call a speedy response?
- Pardon me, ma'am?
- I set that alarm off 45 seconds ago.
Ma'am, we try to respond as fast as we can.
But we do need a codeword.
Codeword?
Oh, I'll give you a codeword.
- "Dickhead".
- Mother.
When you reach my age, Annie, you can say whatever the hell you want.
Does Dr. Lewis let you drink?
Dr. Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.
Says it doesn't make a difference what I do.
We'll get that taken in.
You know the only thing I regret?
I never had a chance to grow out the grey.
I can tell you the exact day I got ill.
It was the day your father died.
- Stay back.
Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?
Just stay back!
Paul!
Paul, just help my mother!
- Excuse me!
- Give us a comment!
Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.
(Octavia) You are a life-saver, Paul.
He'll make a great father someday.
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.
I'd like a winter funeral - especially with this climate.
Mrs. Tarrant?
Ma'am.
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.
I wouldn't want to upset him.
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.
Hey!
My guardian angel.
- How are you?
- Ah, I've been better.
How's Mom?
She's coping.
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?
Come on, Annie.
Law school was Dad's dream, not mine.
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.
Just tell me what happened last night.
This asshole sat down and he ordered a drink.
He started chewing' on his ice...
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!
What happened?
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.
Think I'll let some country-club pissant slip through our fingers?
The boy is getting sloppy.
The first three victims were John Does.
Until number four:
Mr. Coleman Tarrant.
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?
None other than young Ethan.
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?
Am I protecting someone?
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.
Can't help him now.
I knew kids like him in school.
Always thought they were better than me, cos they lived in some fucking mansion up on Esplanade Avenue.
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.
Don't you get it, Annie?
I did it.
I confessed.
End of story.
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin' Mardi Gras with my husband after all.
I know what this is about.
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished, even when they've done nothing wrong.
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.
You were just in the house that night.
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!
I said, leave it alone!
- Damn!
- Time's up.
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No!
No!
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant, but this is an open-and-shut case.
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.
Look, we're talking about more than Dr. Purcell's murder here.
What are you saying?
It's possible that Ethan was involved in your father's death as well.
They were killed in exactly the same way.
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.
My brother didn't do this.
We'll see.
(Kingfish) This is going out to the man with the hook.
Hey, man, chill.
Relax.
Have some gumbo or somethin'.
Even the Kingfish know when to draw the line.
Going somewhere, Ben?
- Oh, yeah.
I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh.
He's got to do the do.
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.
You're a lightweight.
Do you think a family can be cursed?
When we were growing up, we thought we were the luckiest kids in the world.
Ethan was so smart.
Daddy thought he'd be the first Tarrant in the Supreme Court.
But when he died, there was this... cloud.
Annie.
Annie!
You gotta start thinkin' of the good things in life.
You got a whole classroom full of kids who give a damn because of you.
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.
At least, your mama thinks so.
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.
Hey!
Get the hell outta here!
Goddamn tourist.
Gotta do the do.
Hm?
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me.
It's lookin' good.
I just can't seem to finish it.
(Annie) The happy family.
We'll do better.
I promise.
Daddy loved this house.
Even after we moved out, he'd always drive us past it.
It was as if he was drawn to it.
(Kingfish) Are you with me, Crescent City?
Do you feel it comin' on?
When the Catholic Church realized they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways,
- they invited...
- (switches off radio)
- What's that for?
- Just in case.
- (switches on car alarm)
- That's a good idea, honey.
Jesus.
This explains a lot.
Paul, I haven't lived here for 13 years.
Annie!
- I don't think we're alone.
- (clinking)
Oh...
You scared the hell out of me.
Keep your fucking hands off my things.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to get in your way.
Goddamn fool.
- Just like the others.
- Paul.
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.
You see, I used to live here.
I'm with her.
And I thought I'd met all your relatives.
No, no, no!
Annie, what are we looking for here?
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.
But it's more than that.
Follow me.
This... was my bedroom.
Oh, this is nice.
Ah, see?
You got the room with the view.
Those were the old slave quarters.
Ethan and I were never allowed to play there.
It happened in there.
Ow!
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.
(barking)
Hey!
What are you doing?
Goddammit.
(alarm bleeps)
Hey, come on, guys.
Come on.
Would you relax?
Let's go.
Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.
Right now, those kids are the only thing that's keeping me sane.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- I'll see you later.
- OK.
Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.
Boys...
Liz, what's his name?
Stop this!
Why are you doing this?
Drew, Matt, stop it!
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.
Wait a second.
Stop it.
What is the problem?
Matthew!
Drew!
Now stop it!
- What is going on?
- He started it.
- Liar.
- He did.
Look.
Matthew?
What is it?
It's the Candyman.
They killed him.
Listen, guys.
There's no such thing as a Candyman.
It's just a story, a really scary story.
And these come from Matthew's imagination.
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...
Sometimes there are people in this world that do bad things.
Horrible things.
When they don't get caught, we blame imaginary monsters for their crimes.
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.
Five times.
If you say his name five times, he's supposed to come.
You guys don't really believe that, do you?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to prove it, then.
Here goes.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
(Annie) You see?
Nothing happened.
(buzzing)
I can't believe you actually did that.
It was the only way I could convince them.
And maybe yourself?
- What does that mean?
- I think you know.
What?
Are you ready for dessert?
Again?
Come on.
There are no monsters.
(hums)
Shit!
Do you need any help out there?
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.
Paul?
Annie.
Annie.
I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom.
Annie,
I came for you.
Ready or not...
Paul...
We have a journey to make, you and I.
McKeever negotiates the steps, saves the dessert.
What a guy!
(tray crashes)
Annie, be with me.
You're mine.
Mardi Gras - every night's like a full moon.
If you ask me, that family won the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.
Give it a rest, Ray.
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.
It was him.
Him?
Who is "him"?
He just came out of the shadows.
He had this hook that came out of his arm, and bees were crawling out of his face.
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras.
Now, if you saw some kind of freak in a costume...
It wasn't a mask.
- He's real.
- Of course.
What about my brother?
There's no reason to think your husband's murder...
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.
Well, if he is, then that just leaves you, doesn't it?
Oh, Annie.
Annie.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, thank heavens... (whispers) She's lyin'.
I'm here, honey.
We're almost home, honey.
Here.
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.
Why did Daddy go to the house that night?
- What did he know?
- Annie, please.
You should rest.
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
Just go to sleep.
That's what you need.
That's what we all need.
(Kingfish) Today is the day, New Orleans.
It's Mardi Gras.
And time is already running' out.
When the clock strikes midnight, when good ol' Comus greets Rex, when the police on their horses come to sweep us out of the Quarter, it, mes amis, is histoire.
(tapping on windowpane)
- Annie.
- No.
You brought me here.
You killed Paul.
Swallow your horror, and let it nourish you.
Come with me, and sing the song of misery.
Share my world,
Annie.
No!
Annie!
It's all right.
It's all right.
You were just dreamin'.
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.
We leave life just like we came in.
- Alone?
- Naked, blind, and covered in our own shit.
Oh, no, but not me.
I'm goin' in my prom dress.
The Lord knows it fits again.
(phone)
You rest.
I'll get that.
I don't care what they say.
Tell them she's ill.
Tell them they should be in school, for God's sake.
Who is it?
It's no one, Annie.
Why don't you just go back up to bed?
Send them up.
Here?
(both speak at once)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.
Now, tell me exactly what happened.
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if?
(Kingfish) Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.
We are eatin' the meat raw.
I tell ya what.
I'm not goin' home till this is over.
I'm on the air full time.
Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.
Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.
Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis, and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.
- Who you lookin' for?
- I'm Matthew's teacher.
- I'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.
- Please.
I wanna help.
- Help?
We've had way too much of that already.
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?
I always worried about him being on the street after dark, but... he didn't want his daddy tagging' along when he went to buy his paints, so...
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?
The police don't give a damn.
They figure, one less drug dealer or potential murderer to worry about.
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.
Ever since his mother died, he's been having nightmares.
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.
- It's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them?
The paintings.
He calls this his studio.
Oh, Lord.
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.
But how did it happen to Matthew?
I see it every day.
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.
But what if it's true?
What if the Candyman does exist?
Then only God can save us.
Come on, guys, let's go home.
No, I'm gettin' this up.
- Come on.
Come on, guys.
- I'm tryin' to do this.
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.
Damn.
What do you want me to do?
Bees got him.
You will all be punished.
(laughter)
Even you.
(Kingfish) That's right, New Orleans, it's Mardi Gras.
It's Fat Tuesday, and I am fat.
My belt is broken, my pants are open, my belly is a mountain of love stuffed with oysters.
And y'all know what tomorrow is.
Ash Wednesday.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I just stood there and watched Paul die.
And now Matthew.
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.
Oh, Jesus.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.
You and Mom.
But it wasn't enough.
- It'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?
What was Daddy doing there?
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.
You weren't around to see how obsessed he became.
I mean, all Dad ever talked about was callin' the...
Callin' him.
It got so bad, I was afraid to leave him alone.
But, that night, he got away from me.
I knew exactly where he'd go.
He'd been goin' to the house every night.
(bloodcurdling scream)
I blew it, Annie.
- If I'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why?
Why did he call him?
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.
- What has our family got to do with this?
- I don't know.
Dad wouldn't tell me.
Before he died, he got in touch with this guy who trafficked in black market stuff.
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?
- He won't talk to ya.
I tried.
- His name.
Thibideaux.
He's in the Quarter.
No, don't go.
It's too dangerous.
- I must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.
There isn't time.
Besides, you'll be safe here.
There's always someone watching.
- I think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, get it where it's dripping' there.
- I'm gonna try.
Would you care for something sweet?
A small snowball, please.
Cherry?
Cherry would be fine.
Sweets for the sweet.
Would you like something else?
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted with anybody by that name.
- It's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.
He's dead.
He was murdered.
Coleman Tarrant.
Clara, why don't you run on ahead to that party and I'll meet you over there, OK?
I'll have you know, Honoré, I intend to collect on that drink you promised me.
(Honoré) Oh, yeah, baby.
I'm countin' on it.
Hello.
You wait here.
I'm gonna take a look.
Your father understood the difference between history and age.
Some pieces are merely old.
Others have history.
And history, because it reflects life, is not always pretty.
It eats, it - if you'll pardon the expression - shits.
Most of the objects your father sought held history within them.
Your father found out that the Candyman was born here in New Orleans.
His name was Daniel Robitaille.
And she was his lover.
Caroline Sullivan.
Your father was almost as obsessed with her as he was with the Candyman.
Why?
There was something of hers he most desperately wanted.
Her mirror.
Those who witnessed the horror said that Robitaille's suffering was so agonizing, so unbearable, that his soul became trapped in Caroline's mirror.
And my father thought he could stop him with it.
Break the mirror, break the curse.
Where's the mirror now?
Who knows?
Caroline found it next to Robitaille's body and disappeared.
There were rumors, of course.
Suicide...
Your father never believed that, though.
Let me go.
(buzzing)
What do you want from me?
There's a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
You cannot change who you are.
(yelling)
(whistles)
Come on!
Shit.
You have a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
Oh, Paul.
Who am I?
(children's laughter)
(Kingfish) The world is turning, brothers and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.
And I'm not the man I used to be.
I got hooves on my shoes and horns on my head.
I want life on a platter, medium rare.
And you can keep the silverware, cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.
Who's there?
Robitaille was born right here in New Orleans.
- I know.
- I called him in front of Matthew.
All slave births were registered here.
Daniel Robitaille.
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.
That's my family's house.
That's where I was born.
There's more.
If what Matthew believes is true,
I hope you can stop it.
God bless you.
They had a daughter.
Officer, they told me to make a report.
Sit down over here.
Take a look.
Take a good look.
- I can't keep doing this.
- Look!
More of your sister's handiwork.
- No!
Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!
I'm on to your sick games!
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been covering' for her all along.
You don't know what you're talkin' about!
It's him!
Who?
Your friend the Candyman?
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.
Should we call him?
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.
- Candyman.
- No, don't.
Candyman.
Candyman.
- Don't.
- Candyman.
No!
No!
No!
Stop!
I said, stop!
(sirens)
We were just wondering if you'd seen Mrs. Tarrant's daughter, Annie.
No, there's been no activity at all.
No!
No!
No!
God, no!
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?
No, ma'am.
Oh, Annie.
You lied to us from the beginning.
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.
No, it's not true.
It's true.
Caroline bought the house because that's where he was born.
And she raised their daughter in that house.
Your grandmother.
She was raised a white girl, and no one suspected the truth.
But Daddy did.
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.
- But you just kept on lying.
- I did it to protect you.
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have children of your own.
You'll understand.
I'll never lie to my child.
Your father was tryin' to destroy everything we had
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,
- by denying the truth.
- I am not a part of him!
- We're his family!
- No!
- We're his blood!
- I will not have you talk like that.
You can't wash him away with a bottle!
There is no Candyman.
He does not exist.
My child.
You doubted me - your own flesh and blood.
Death is a return, you know.
Annie...
Annie, it's almost time.
Time for our journey.
Soon we'll be together, just the way I planned.
You cannot resist what is in your blood.
Our blood.
Your baby's blood.
You can't fight what is meant to be.
The choice will be yours, Annie.
I'm so sorry.
No!
Miss Tarrant!
(banging)
Go on!
Quick!
Go around the back there.
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Ethan's dead.
I'm sorry.
He was shot trying to escape.
Detective Levesque's body was found... mutilated.
The guards assumed...
I watched the video tape of what happened in that room.
Ray's body was torn apart by somethin' powerful, and it wasn't your brother.
You better hurry before they get here.
(Kingfish) 29 minutes to go, New Orleans.
29 minutes till judgment.
So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.
Yeah, you're right.
I said it.
Y'all can trust the Kingfish.
The heavens have just opened up on us and the banks of the Mississippi are about to burst.
I don't think they're gonna hold it back any more.
They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.
Yeah, Mardi Gras.
Where is it?
Where is it?
God damn you!
The slave quarters.
Matthew!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
You should go home.
I knew when you called him, he'd come.
Like before.
You were hiding here.
He's in my dreams, Annie.
- I know.
- I had to see...
I wanted to see him for real.
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.
It must be down there.
Be careful.
Annie!
Go back!
Get some help, Matthew!
Annie, don't.
The mirror is the secret of my strength.
The keeper of my soul.
The destiny of our family.
Annie, our journey begins.
This is why I brought you here.
I was not always this way.
This is who I've become.
You must see what they did.
My only sin was to love Caroline, and to give her a daughter.
They took everything from me, Annie.
Let me go.
My family.
Did you think you could get away from us?
My child.
My life.
No!
Be my witness.
See how I became the reflection of their hatred.
Their evil.
(woman) Kill him!
See what it means to call me by that name.
Candyman.
- Candyman.
- (all chant) Candyman, Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!
My pain was unbearable.
But Caroline's was even greater.
Let him go!
Stop her!
No!
- Father!
- Caroline.
You will all be damned.
You defiled my daughter.
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?
Candyman...
Now, do you see what was taken from me?
Yes.
No!
No!
They killed me, Annie.
But they could not destroy my soul.
Join me, Annie.
We will go together to a world without pain.
No more pain.
Death is only the beginning.
Your cradle will be your grave.
- Annie.
- (Octavia) Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
- Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
- (Ethan) Annie.
- (Octavia) Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
(Candyman) Annie.
(thunder)
- (Matthew) Annie!
- (all) Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Grab my arm, Annie!
- Annie!
- (Drew) Grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Come here!
Grab my hand!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Annie, the choice is no longer yours.
You are mine.
The cradle is your grave, not mine.
No.
Go!
Let's get out of here.
Go!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
(Kingfish) Yeah, it's Lent.
So y'all take it easy.
We made it through another one, New Orleans.
And the Kingfish hope you got plenty to atone for.
Hope you all said a fond farewell to the flesh.
Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.
And we are startin' it again.
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.
That's your mommy.
She's pretty.
That's right.
And who's that?
That little girl is your great-grandma, Isabel.
And that's her mommy, Caroline.
That's my name, too.
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.
And when you get a little older, I will tell you a story about him.
- Tell me now.
- Uh-uh.
Right now, it's time for your nap.
(tinkling)
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman,
- Cand...
- Caroline!
Go to sleep.
Visiontext Subtitles:
Marisa Castle de Joncaire
(lecturer) He died for love.
Born just after the Civil War, Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves, an artist by trade.
A wealthy landowner commissioned him to paint the portrait of his daughter.
They fell in love.
She became pregnant.
Her father had his thugs chase the poor man through the town.
When they caught him, they sawed off his right hand with a rusty blade.
A nearby beehive was raided, and the honeycomb smeared over his bleeding, mutilated body.
The crowd that had gathered fled as the bees came for him.
He died for love.
His resurrection began as rumour, and grew into myth.
Say his name five times in the mirror and he would appear.
A hook had replaced his severed hand.
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.
The myth has travelled from place to place, taking root in the most desperate areas.
Even here, in New Orleans, murders have been committed in his name.
Yes, but is he real?
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1 992.
Helen Lyle becomes so obsessed by the myth that she takes on the persona of Candyman, killing her victims with a hook.
Cabrini residents believe she was the Candyman.
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?
I believe in the myth.
But the fact?
The flesh and blood?
No.
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman.
Well, that is a relief.
My publisher would never have forgiven me.
Imagine the headlines:
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated with Hook on Book Tour."
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet our Candyman, Peter.
- (crash) - (cat miaows)
Oh, I'm sorry.
These streets have got me all turned around.
We were a little shy back there, were we?
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".
Ethan Tarrant.
Ethan, I'm sorry about what happened to your father.
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea
- How many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.
I'm not saying he was.
You told him there was no Candyman.
You told him to say the name - and now he's dead.
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.
Daniel Robitaille has been dead and buried for a very long time.
He's here.
You called him.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
You're next, Purcell.
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.
Give me a shot of single malt.
Fucking murderer!
Hey!
Get him the fuck outta here!
You're next, Purcell.
Get out!
It's... my book.
" WBOV
(radio) Are you with me, New Orleans?
Do ya hear me?
This is the Kingfish coming to you at 96.2 FM.
Anointed and appointed.
Just three more days, Crescent City, three days until Lent.
So let's have it, the merriment before the penance, and the feast before the fast.
The Kingfish gonna keep y'all company all the way down.
Hey, brothers and sisters, y'all know what "carnival" means in Latin?
Well, the Kingfish went to the good schools, so he can tell you all about it.
"Carnival.
Farewell to the flesh. "
That's what it means.
I like that a lot. "Farewell to the flesh. "
Yeah, you right.
And farewell to all that flooding', as far as I'm concerned.
That's right.
Look at it.
The banks of the mighty Mississippi are ready to spill their seed.
Just look at that sky out there.
It's ready to rain on us again.
And the clouds?
Well, now, brothers and sisters, they're not the only thing threatening' the Crescent City.
We're talking murder, mes amis.
Coœ so we've heard before, the hook man, kerchunk.
So when you pull on your costume and turn to admire yourself in the mirror, please keep those lips locked tight.
Do not call his name.
Is he always so angry?
Guess so.
- And why do you think that is?
- Coœ he's been hurt.
"Coœ he's been hurt"(!
)
Who hurt him, Matthew?
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie.
Look.
Come here.
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?
No way.
I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.
Why not?
It's not going anywhere.
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.
Annie, if there's one thing these kids understand, it's taking care of themselves.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.
Hey, Pam.
You movin' in here, or what?
No.
No, let's go.
- Howdy, Miss Tarrant.
- Hi, Greg.
(alarm)
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Oh!
Lord, I hate that thing.
- Then why leave it on all the time?
- Annie, please.
Don't start with me.
- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Ah!
Well, he barely even spoke to me.
He only wants to see you.
Oh, Annie.
I mean, murder.
(phone)
- Hello, Mrs Tarrant.
- Is that what you call a speedy response?
- Pardon me, ma'am?
- I set that alarm off 45 seconds ago.
Ma'am, we try to respond as fast as we can.
But we do need a codeword.
Codeword?
Oh, I'll give you a codeword.
- "Dickhead".
- Mother.
When you reach my age, Annie, you can say whatever the hell you want.
Does Dr Lewis let you drink?
Dr Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.
Says it doesn't make a difference what I do.
We'll get that taken in.
You know the only thing I regret?
I never had a chance to grow out the grey.
I can tell you the exact day I got ill.
It was the day your father died.
- Stay back.
Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?
Just stay back!
Paul!
Paul, just help my mother!
- Excuse me!
- Give us a comment!
Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.
(Octavia) You are a life-saver, Paul.
He'll make a great father someday.
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.
I'd like a winter funeral - especially with this climate.
Mrs Tarrant?
Ma'am.
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.
I wouldn't want to upset him.
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.
Hey!
My guardian angel.
- How are you?
- Ah, I've been better.
How's Mom?
She's coping.
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?
Come on, Annie.
Law school was Dad's dream, not mine.
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.
Just tell me what happened last night.
This asshole sat down and he ordered a drink.
He started chewing' on his ice...
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!
What happened?
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.
Think I'll let some country-club pissant slip through our fingers?
The boy is getting sloppy.
The first three victims were John Does.
Until number four:
Mr Coleman Tarrant.
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?
None other than young Ethan.
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?
Am I protecting someone?
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.
Can't help him now.
I knew kids like him in school.
Always thought they were better than me, cos they lived in some fucking mansion up on Esplanade Avenue.
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.
Don't you get it, Annie?
I did it.
I confessed.
End of story.
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin' Mardi Gras with my husband after all.
I know what this is about.
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished, even when they've done nothing wrong.
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.
You were just in the house that night.
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!
I said, leave it alone!
- Damn!
- Time's up.
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No!
No!
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant, but this is an open-and-shut case.
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.
Look, we're talking about more than Dr Purcell's murder here.
What are you saying?
It's possible that Ethan was involved in your father's death as well.
They were killed in exactly the same way.
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.
My brother didn't do this.
We'll see.
(Kingfish) This is going out to the man with the hook.
Hey, man, chill.
Relax.
Have some gumbo or somethin'.
Even the Kingfish know when to draw the line.
Going somewhere, Ben?
- Oh, yeah.
I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh.
He's got to do the do.
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.
You're a lightweight.
Do you think a family can be cursed?
When we were growing up, we thought we were the luckiest kids in the world.
Ethan was so smart.
Daddy thought he'd be the first Tarrant in the Supreme Court.
But when he died, there was this... cloud.
Annie.
Annie!
You gotta start thinkin' of the good things in life.
You got a whole classroom full of kids who give a damn because of you.
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.
At least, your mama thinks so.
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.
Hey!
Get the hell outta here!
Goddamn tourist.
Gotta do the do.
Hm?
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me.
It's lookin' good.
I just can't seem to finish it.
(Annie) The happy family.
We'll do better.
I promise.
Daddy loved this house.
Even after we moved out, he'd always drive us past it.
It was as if he was drawn to it.
(Kingfish) Are you with me, Crescent City?
Do you feel it comin' on?
When the Catholic Church realised they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways,
- They invited...
- (switches off radio)
- What's that for?
- Just in case.
- (switches on car alarm)
- That's a good idea, honey.
Jesus.
This explains a lot.
Paul, I haven't lived here for 1 3 years.
Annie!
- I don't think we're alone.
- (clinking)
Oh...
You scared the hell out of me.
Keep your fucking hands off my things.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to get in your way.
Goddamn fool.
- Just like the others.
- Paul.
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.
You see, I used to live here.
I'm with her.
And I thought I'd met all your relatives.
No, no, no!
Annie, what are we looking for here?
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.
But it's more than that.
Follow me.
This... was my bedroom.
Oh, this is nice.
Ah, see?
You got the room with the view.
Those were the old slave quarters.
Ethan and I were never allowed to play there.
It happened in there.
Ow!
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.
(barking)
Hey!
What are you doing?
Goddammit.
(alarm bleeps)
Hey, come on, guys.
Come on.
Would you relax?
Let's go.
Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.
Right now, those kids are the only thing that's keeping me sane.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- I'll see you later.
- OK.
Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.
Boys...
Liz, what's his name?
Stop this!
Why are you doing this?
Drew, Matt, stop it!
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.
Wait a second.
Stop it.
What is the problem?
Matthew!
Drew!
Now stop it!
- What is going on?
- He started it.
- Liar.
- He did.
Look.
Matthew?
What is it?
It's the Candyman.
They killed him.
Listen, guys.
There's no such thing as a Candyman.
It's just a story, a really scary story.
And these come from Matthew's imagination.
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...
Sometimes there are people in this world that do bad things.
Horrible things.
When they don't get caught, we blame imaginary monsters for their crimes.
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.
Five times.
If you say his name five times, he's supposed to come.
You guys don't really believe that, do you?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to prove it, then.
Here goes.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
(Annie) You see?
Nothing happened.
(buzzing)
I can't believe you actually did that.
It was the only way I could convince them.
And maybe yourself?
- What does that mean?
- l think you know.
What?
Are you ready for dessert?
Again?
Come on.
There are no monsters.
(hums)
Shit!
Do you need any help out there?
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.
Paul?
Annie.
Annie.
I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom.
Annie, I came for you.
Ready or not...
Paul...
We have a journey to make, you and I.
McKeever negotiates the steps, saves the dessert.
What a guy!
(tray crashes)
Annie, be with me.
You're mine.
Mardi Gras - every night's like a full moon.
If you ask me, that family won the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.
Give it a rest, Ray.
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.
It was him.
Him?
Who is "him"?
He just came out of the shadows.
He had this hook that came out of his arm, and bees were crawling out of his face.
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras.
Now, if you saw some kind of freak in a costume... lt wasn't a mask.
- He's real.
- Of course.
What about my brother?
There's no reason to think your husband's murder...
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.
Well, if he is, then that just leaves you, doesn't it?
Oh, Annie.
Annie.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, thank heavens... (whispers) She's lyin'.
I'm here, honey.
We're almost home, honey.
Here.
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.
Why did Daddy go to the house that night?
- What did he know?
- Annie, please.
You should rest.
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
Just go to sleep.
That's what you need.
That's what we all need.
(Kingfish) Today is the day, New Orleans. lt's Mardi Gras.
And time is already running' out.
When the clock strikes midnight, when good ol' Comus greets Rex, when the police on their horses come to sweep us out of the Quarter, it, mes amis, is histoire.
(tapping on windowpane)
- Annie.
- No.
You brought me here.
You killed Paul.
Swallow your horror, and let it nourish you.
Come with me, and sing the song of misery.
Share my world,
Annie.
No!
Annie!
It's all right. lt's all right.
You were just dreamin'.
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.
We leave life just like we came in.
- Alone?
- Naked, blind, and covered in our own shit.
Oh, no, but not me.
I'm goin' in my prom dress.
The Lord knows it fits again.
(phone)
You rest. I'll get that.
I don't care what they say.
Tell them she's ill.
Tell them they should be in school, for God's sake.
Who is it?
It's no one, Annie.
Why don't you just go back up to bed?
Send them up.
Here?
(both speak at once)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.
Now, tell me exactly what happened.
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if...?
(Kingfish) Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.
We are eatin' the meat raw.
I tell ya what. I'm not goin' home till this is over.
I'm on the air full time.
Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.
Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.
Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis, and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.
- Who you lookin' for?
- l'm Matthew's teacher.
- l'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.
- Please. I wanna help.
- Help?
We've had way too much of that already.
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?
I always worried about him being on the street after dark, but... he didn't want his daddy tagging' along when he went to buy his paints, so...
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?
The police don't give a damn.
They figure, one less drug dealer or potential murderer to worry about.
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.
Ever since his mother died, he's been having nightmares.
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.
- lt's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them?
The paintings.
He calls this his studio.
Oh, Lord.
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.
But how did it happen to Matthew?
I see it every day.
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.
But what if it's true?
What if the Candyman does exist?
Then only God can save us.
Come on, guys, let's go home.
No, I'm gettin' this up.
- Come on.
Come on, guys.
- l'm tryin' to do this.
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.
Damn.
What do you want me to do?
Bees got him.
You will all be punished.
(laughter)
Even you.
(Kingfish) That's right, New Orleans, it's Mardi Gras.
It's Fat Tuesday, and I am fat.
My belt is broken, my pants are open, my belly is a mountain of love stuffed with oysters.
And y'all know what tomorrow is.
Ash Wednesday.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I just stood there and watched Paul die.
And now Matthew.
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.
Oh, Jesus.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- l wanted to protect you.
You and Mom.
But it wasn't enough.
- lt'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?
What was Daddy doing there?
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.
You weren't around to see how obsessed he became.
I mean, all Dad ever talked about was callin' the...
Callin' him. lt got so bad, I was afraid to leave him alone.
But, that night, he got away from me.
I knew exactly where he'd go.
He'd been goin' to the house every night.
(bloodcurdling scream)
I blew it, Annie.
- lf l'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why?
Why did he call him?
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.
- What has our family got to do with this?
- l don't know.
Dad wouldn't tell me.
Before he died, he got in touch with this guy who trafficked in black market stuff.
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?
- He won't talk to ya. I tried.
- His name.
Thibideaux.
He's in the Quarter.
No, don't go. lt's too dangerous.
- l must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.
There isn't time.
Besides, you'll be safe here.
There's always someone watching.
- l think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, get it where it's dripping' there.
- l'm gonna try.
Would you care for something sweet?
A small snowball, please.
Cherry?
Cherry would be fine.
Sweets for the sweet.
Would you like something else?
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted with anybody by that name.
- lt's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.
He's dead.
He was murdered.
Coleman Tarrant.
Clara, why don't you run on ahead to that party and I'll meet you over there, OK?
I'll have you know, Honore, I intend to collect on that drink you promised me.
(Honore) Oh, yeah, baby.
I'm countin' on it.
Hello.
You wait here.
I'm gonna take a look.
Your father understood the difference between history and age.
Some pieces are merely old.
Others have history.
And history, because it reflects life, is not always pretty.
It eats, it - if you'll pardon the expression - shits.
Most of the objects your father sought held history within them.
Your father found out that the Candyman was born here in New Orleans.
His name was Daniel Robitaille.
And she was his lover.
Caroline Sullivan.
Your father was almost as obsessed with her as he was with the Candyman.
Why?
There was something of hers he most desperately wanted.
Her mirror.
Those who witnessed the horror said that Robitaille's suffering was so agonising, so unbearable, that his soul became trapped in Caroline's mirror.
And my father thought he could stop him with it.
Break the mirror, break the curse.
Where's the mirror now?
Who knows?
Caroline found it next to Robitaille's body and disappeared.
There were rumours, of course.
Suicide...
Your father never believed that, though.
Let me go.
(buzzing)
What do you want from me?
There's a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
You cannot change who you are.
(yelling)
(whistles)
Come on!
Shit.
You have a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
Oh, Paul.
Who am I?
(children's laughter)
(Kingfish) The world is turning, brothers and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.
And I'm not the man I used to be.
I got hooves on my shoes and horns on my head.
I want life on a platter, medium rare.
And you can keep the silverware, cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.
Who's there?
Robitaille was born right here in New Orleans.
- l know.
- l called him in front of Matthew.
All slave births were registered here.
Daniel Robitaille.
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.
That's my family's house.
That's where l was born.
There's more.
If what Matthew believes is true, I hope you can stop it.
God bless you.
They had a daughter.
Officer, they told me to make a report.
Sit down over here.
Take a look.
Take a good look.
- l can't keep doing this.
- Look!
More of your sister's handiwork.
- No!
Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!
I'm on to your sick games!
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been covering' for her all along.
You don't know what you're talkin' about!
It's him!
Who?
Your friend the Candyman?
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.
Should we call him?
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.
- Candyman.
- No, don't.
Candyman.
Candyman.
- Don't.
- Candyman.
No!
No!
No!
Stop!
I said, stop!
(sirens)
We were just wondering if you'd seen Mrs Tarrant's daughter, Annie.
No, there's been no activity at all.
No!
No!
No!
God, no!
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?
No, ma'am.
Oh, Annie.
You lied to us from the beginning.
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.
No, it's not true.
It's true.
Caroline bought the house because that's where he was born.
And she raised their daughter in that house.
Your grandmother.
She was raised a white girl, and no one suspected the truth.
But Daddy did.
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.
- But you just kept on lying.
- l did it to protect you.
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have children of your own.
You'll understand.
I'll never lie to my child.
Your father was tryin' to destroy everything we had
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,
- by denying the truth.
- l am not a part of him!
- We're his family!
- No!
- We're his blood!
- l will not have you talk like that.
You can't wash him away with a bottle!
There is no Candyman.
He does not exist.
My child.
You doubted me - your own flesh and blood.
Death is a return, you know.
Annie...
Annie, it's almost time.
Time for our journey.
Soon we'll be together, just the way I planned.
You cannot resist what is in your blood.
Our blood.
Your baby's blood.
You can't fight what is meant to be.
The choice will be yours, Annie.
I'm so sorry.
No!
Miss Tarrant!
(banging)
Go on!
Quick!
Go around the back there.
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Ethan's dead.
I'm sorry.
He was shot trying to escape.
Detective Levesque's body was found... mutilated.
The guards assumed... I watched the video tape of what happened in that room.
Ray's body was torn apart by somethin' powerful, and it wasn't your brother.
You better hurry before they get here.
(Kingfish) 29 minutes to go, New Orleans.
29 minutes till judgment.
So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.
Yeah, you're right. I said it.
Y'all can trust the Kingfish.
The heavens have just opened up on us and the banks of the Mississippi are about to burst.
I don't think they're gonna hold it back any more.
They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.
Yeah, Mardi Gras.
Where is it?
Where is it?
God damn you!
The slave quarters.
Matthew!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
You should go home.
I knew when you called him, he'd come.
Like before.
You were hiding here.
He's in my dreams, Annie.
- l know.
- l had to see... I wanted to see him for real.
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.
It must be down there.
Be careful.
Annie!
Go back!
Get some help, Matthew!
Annie, don't.
The mirror is the secret of my strength.
The keeper of my soul.
The destiny of our family.
Annie, our journey begins.
This is why I brought you here.
I was not always this way.
This is who I've become.
You must see what they did.
My only sin was to love Caroline, and to give her a daughter.
They took everything from me, Annie.
Let me go.
My family.
Did you think you could get away from us?
My child.
My life.
No!
Be my witness.
See how I became the reflection of their hatred.
Their evil.
(woman) Kill him!
See what it means to call me by that name.
Candyman.
- Candyman.
- (all chant) Candyman, Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!
My pain was unbearable.
But Caroline's was even greater.
Let him go!
Stop her!
No!
- Father!
- Caroline.
You will all be damned.
You defiled my daughter.
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?
Candyman...
Now, do you see what was taken from me?
Yes.
No!
No!
They killed me, Annie.
But they could not destroy my soul.
Join me, Annie.
We will go together to a world without pain.
No more pain.
Death is only the beginning.
Your cradle will be your grave.
- Annie.
- (Octavia) Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
- Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
- (Ethan) Annie.
- (Octavia) Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
(Candyman) Annie.
(thunder)
- (Matthew) Annie!
- (all) Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Grab my arm, Annie!
- Annie!
- (Drew) Grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Come here!
Grab my hand!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Annie, the choice is no longer yours.
You are mine.
The cradle is your grave, not mine.
No.
Go!
Let's get out of here.
Go!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
(Kingfish) Yeah, it's Lent.
So y'all take it easy.
We made it through another one, New Orleans.
And the Kingfish hope you got plenty to atone for.
Hope you all said a fond farewell to the flesh.
Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.
And we are startin' it again.
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.
That's your mommy.
She's pretty.
That's right.
And who's that?
That little girl is your great-grandma, Isabel.
And that's her mommy, Caroline.
That's my name, too.
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.
And when you get a little older, I will tell you a story about him.
- Tell me now.
- Uh-uh.
Right now, it's time for your nap.
(tinkling)
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman,
- Cand...
- Caroline!
Go to sleep.
He died for love.
Born just after the Civil War, Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves, an artist by trade.
A wealthy landowner commissioned him to paint the portrait of his daughter.
They fell in love.
She became pregnant.
Her father had his thugs chase the poor man through the town.
When they caught him, they sawed off his right hand with a rusty blade.
A nearby beehive was raided, and the honeycomb smeared over his bleeding, mutilated body.
The crowd that had gathered fled as the bees came for him.
He died for love.
His resurrection began as rumor, and grew into myth.
Say his name five times in the mirror and he would appear.
A hook had replaced his severed hand.
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.
The myth has traveled from place to place, taking root in the most desperate areas.
Even here, in New Orleans, murders have been committed in his name.
Yes, but is he real?
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1992.
Helen Lyle becomes so obsessed by the myth that she takes on the persona of Candyman, killing her victims with a hook.
Cabrini residents believe she was the Candyman.
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?
I believe in the myth.
But the fact?
The flesh and blood?
No.
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman.
Well, that is a relief.
My publisher would never have forgiven me.
Imagine the headlines:
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated with Hook on Book Tour."
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet our Candyman, Peter.
Oh, I'm sorry.
These streets have got me all turned around.
We were a little shy back there, were we?
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".
Ethan Tarrant.
Ethan, I'm sorry about what happened to your father.
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea
- how many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.
I'm not saying he was.
You told him there was no Candyman.
You told him to say the name...
and now he's dead.
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.
Daniel Robitaille has been dead and buried for a very long time.
He's here.
You called him.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
You're next, Purcell.
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.
Give me a shot of single malt.
Fucking murderer!
Hey!
Get him the fuck outta here!
You're next, Purcell.
Get out!
It's... my book.
WBOV.
Are you with me, New Orleans?
Do ya hear me?
This is the Kingfish coming to you at 96.2 FM.
Anointed and appointed.
Just three more days, Crescent City, three days until Lent.
So let's have it, the merriment before the penance, and the feast before the fast.
The Kingfish gonna keep y'all company all the way down.
Hey, brothers and sisters, y'all know what "carnival" means in Latin?
Well, the Kingfish went to the good schools, so he can tell you all about it.
"Carnival: farewell to the flesh."
That's what it means.
I like that a lot. "Farewell to the flesh."
Yeah, you right.
And farewell to all that flooding', as far as I'm concerned.
That's right.
Look at it.
The banks of the mighty Mississippi are ready to spill their seed.
Just look at that sky out there.
It's ready to rain on us again.
And the clouds?
Well, now, brothers and sisters, they're not the only thing threatening' the Crescent City.
We're talking murder, mes amis.
Cos so we've heard before, the hook man, kerchunk.
So when you pull on your costume and turn to admire yourself in the mirror, please keep those lips locked tight.
Do not call his name.
Is he always so angry?
Guess so.
- And why do you think that is?
- Cos he's been hurt.
"Cos he's been hurt"!
Who hurt him, Matthew?
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie.
Look.
Come here.
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?
No way.
I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.
Why not?
It's not going anywhere.
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.
Annie, if there's one thing these kids understand, it's taking care of themselves.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.
Hey, Pam.
You movin' in here, or what?
No.
No, let's go.
- Howdy, Miss Tarrant.
- Hi, Greg.
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Oh!
Lord, I hate that thing.
- Then why leave it on all the time?
- Annie, please.
Don't start with me.
- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Well, he barely even spoke to me.
He only wants to see you.
Oh, Annie.
I mean, murder.
- Hello, Mrs. Tarrant.
- Is that what you call a speedy response?
- Pardon me, ma'am?
- I set that alarm off 45 seconds ago.
Ma'am, we try to respond as fast as we can.
But we do need a codeword.
Codeword?
Oh, I'll give you a codeword.
- "Dickhead".
- Mother.
When you reach my age, Annie, you can say whatever the hell you want.
Does Dr. Lewis let you drink?
Dr. Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.
Says it doesn't make a difference what I do.
We'll get that taken in.
You know the only thing I regret?
I never had a chance to grow out the grey.
I can tell you the exact day I got ill.
It was the day your father died.
- Stay back.
Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?
Just stay back!
Paul!
Paul, just help my mother!
- Excuse me!
- Give us a comment!
Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.
You are a life-saver, Paul.
He'll make a great father someday.
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.
I'd like a winter funeral...
especially with this climate.
Mrs. Tarrant?
Ma'am.
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.
I wouldn't want to upset him.
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.
Hey!
My guardian angel.
- How are you?
- I've been better.
How's Mom?
She's coping.
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?
Come on, Annie.
Law school was Dad's dream, not mine.
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.
Just tell me what happened last night.
This asshole sat down and he ordered a drink.
He started chewing' on his ice...
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!
What happened?
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.
Think I'll let some country-club pissant slip through our fingers?
The boy is getting sloppy.
The first three victims were John Does.
Until number four:
Mr. Coleman Tarrant.
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?
None other than young Ethan.
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?
Am I protecting someone?
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.
Can't help him now.
I knew kids like him in school.
Always thought they were better than me, cos they lived in some fucking mansion up on Esplanade Avenue.
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.
Don't you get it, Annie?
I did it.
I confessed.
End of story.
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin' Mardi Gras with my husband after all.
I know what this is about.
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished, even when they've done nothing wrong.
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.
You were just in the house that night.
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!
I said, leave it alone!
- Damn!
- Time's up.
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No!
No!
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant, but this is an open-and-shut case.
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.
Look, we're talking about more than Dr. Purcell's murder here.
What are you saying?
It's possible that Ethan was involved in your father's death as well.
They were killed in exactly the same way.
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.
My brother didn't do this.
We'll see.
This is going out to the man with the hook.
Hey, man, chill.
Relax.
Have some gumbo or somethin'.
Even the Kingfish know when to draw the line.
Going somewhere, Ben?
- Oh, yeah.
I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh.
He's got to do the do.
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.
You're a lightweight.
Do you think a family can be cursed?
When we were growing up, we thought we were the luckiest kids in the world.
Ethan was so smart.
Daddy thought he'd be the first Tarrant in the Supreme Court.
But when he died, there was this... cloud.
Annie.
Annie!
You gotta start thinkin' of the good things in life.
You got a whole classroom full of kids who give a damn because of you.
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.
At least, your mama thinks so.
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.
Hey!
Get the hell outta here!
Goddamn tourist.
Gotta do the do.
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me.
It's lookin' good.
I just can't seem to finish it.
The happy family.
We'll do better.
I promise.
Daddy loved this house.
Even after we moved out, he'd always drive us past it.
It was as if he was drawn to it.
Are you with me, Crescent City?
Do you feel it comin' on?
When the Catholic Church realized they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways, they invited...
- What's that for?
- Just in case.
That's a good idea, honey.
Jesus.
This explains a lot.
Paul, I haven't lived here for 13 years.
Annie!
I don't think we're alone.
You scared the hell out of me.
Keep your fucking hands off my things.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to get in your way.
Goddamn fool.
- Just like the others.
- Paul.
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.
You see, I used to live here.
I'm with her.
And I thought I'd met all your relatives.
No, no, no!
Annie, what are we looking for here?
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.
But it's more than that.
Follow me.
This... was my bedroom.
Oh, this is nice.
See?
You got the room with the view.
Those were the old slave quarters.
Ethan and I were never allowed to play there.
It happened in there.
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Goddammit.
Hey, come on, guys.
Come on.
Would you relax?
Let's go.
Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.
Right now, those kids are the only thing that's keeping me sane.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- I'll see you later.
- OK.
Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.
Boys...
Liz, what's his name?
Stop this!
Why are you doing this?
Drew, Matt, stop it!
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.
Wait a second.
Stop it.
What is the problem?
Matthew!
Drew!
Now stop it!
- What is going on?
- He started it.
- Liar.
- He did.
Look.
Matthew?
What is it?
It's the Candyman.
They killed him.
Listen, guys.
There's no such thing as a Candyman.
It's just a story, a really scary story.
And these come from Matthew's imagination.
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...
Sometimes there are people in this world that do bad things.
Horrible things.
When they don't get caught, we blame imaginary monsters for their crimes.
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.
Five times.
If you say his name five times, he's supposed to come.
You guys don't really believe that, do you?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to prove it, then.
Here goes.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
You see?
Nothing happened.
I can't believe you actually did that.
It was the only way I could convince them.
And maybe yourself?
- What does that mean?
- I think you know.
What?
Are you ready for dessert?
Again?
Come on.
There are no monsters.
Shit!
Do you need any help out there?
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.
Paul?
Annie.
Annie.
I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom.
Annie,
I came for you.
Ready or not...
Paul...
We have a journey to make, you and I.
McKeever negotiates the steps, saves the dessert.
What a guy!
Annie, be with me.
You're mine.
Mardi Gras... every night's like a full moon.
If you ask me, that family won the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.
Give it a rest, Ray.
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.
It was him.
Him?
Who is "him"?
He just came out of the shadows.
He had this hook that came out of his arm, and bees were crawling out of his face.
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras.
Now, if you saw some kind of freak in a costume...
It wasn't a mask.
- He's real.
- Of course.
What about my brother?
There's no reason to think your husband's murder...
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.
Well, if he is, then that just leaves you, doesn't it?
Oh, Annie.
Annie.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, thank heavens...
She's lyin'.
I'm here, honey.
We're almost home, honey.
Here.
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.
Why did Daddy go to the house that night?
- What did he know?
- Annie, please.
You should rest.
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
Just go to sleep.
That's what you need.
That's what we all need.
Today is the day, New Orleans.
It's Mardi Gras.
And time is already running' out.
When the clock strikes midnight, when good ol' Comus greets Rex, when the police on their horses come to sweep us out of the Quarter, it, mes amis, is histoire.
- Annie.
- No.
You brought me here.
You killed Paul.
Swallow your horror, and let it nourish you.
Come with me, and sing the song of misery.
Share my world,
Annie.
No!
Annie!
It's all right.
It's all right.
You were just dreamin'.
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.
We leave life just like we came in.
Alone?
Naked, blind, and covered in our own shit.
Oh, no, but not me.
I'm goin' in my prom dress.
The Lord knows it fits again.
You rest.
I'll get that.
I don't care what they say.
Tell them she's ill.
Tell them they should be in school, for God's sake.
Who is it?
It's no one, Annie.
Why don't you just go back up to bed?
Send them up.
Here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.
Now, tell me exactly what happened.
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.
We are eatin' the meat raw.
I tell ya what.
I'm not goin' home till this is over.
I'm on the air full time.
Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.
Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.
Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis, and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.
- Who you lookin' for?
- I'm Matthew's teacher.
- I'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.
- Please.
I wanna help.
- Help?
We've had way too much of that already.
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?
I always worried about him being on the street after dark, but... he didn't want his daddy tagging' along when he went to buy his paints, so...
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?
The police don't give a damn.
They figure, one less drug dealer or potential murderer to worry about.
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.
Ever since his mother died, he's been having nightmares.
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.
- It's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them?
The paintings.
He calls this his studio.
Oh, Lord.
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.
But how did it happen to Matthew?
I see it every day.
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.
But what if it's true?
What if the Candyman does exist?
Then only God can save us.
Come on, guys, let's go home.
No, I'm gettin' this up.
- Come on.
Come on, guys.
- I'm tryin' to do this.
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.
Damn.
What do you want me to do?
Bees got him.
You will all be punished.
Even you.
That's right, New Orleans, it's Mardi Gras.
It's Fat Tuesday, and I am fat.
My belt is broken, my pants are open, my belly is a mountain of love stuffed with oysters.
And y'all know what tomorrow is.
Ash Wednesday.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I just stood there and watched Paul die.
And now Matthew.
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.
Oh, Jesus.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.
You and Mom.
But it wasn't enough.
- It'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?
What was Daddy doing there?
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.
You weren't around to see how obsessed he became.
I mean, all Dad ever talked about was callin' the...
Callin' him.
It got so bad, I was afraid to leave him alone.
But, that night, he got away from me.
I knew exactly where he'd go.
He'd been goin' to the house every night.
I blew it, Annie.
- If I'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why?
Why did he call him?
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.
- What has our family got to do with this?
- I don't know.
Dad wouldn't tell me.
Before he died, he got in touch with this guy who trafficked in black market stuff.
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?
- He won't talk to ya.
I tried.
- His name.
Thibideaux.
He's in the Quarter.
No, don't go.
It's too dangerous.
- I must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.
There isn't time.
Besides, you'll be safe here.
There's always someone watching.
- I think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, get it where it's dripping' there.
- I'm gonna try.
Would you care for something sweet?
A small snowball, please.
Cherry?
Cherry would be fine.
Sweets for the sweet.
Would you like something else?
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted with anybody by that name.
- It's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.
He's dead.
He was murdered.
Coleman Tarrant.
Clara, why don't you run on ahead to that party and I'll meet you over there, OK?
I'll have you know, Honoré, I intend to collect on that drink you promised me.
Oh, yeah, baby.
I'm countin' on it.
Hello.
You wait here.
I'm gonna take a look.
Your father understood the difference between history and age.
Some pieces are merely old.
Others have history.
And history, because it reflects life, is not always pretty.
It eats, it... if you'll pardon the expression... shits.
Most of the objects your father sought held history within them.
Your father found out that the Candyman was born here in New Orleans.
His name was Daniel Robitaille.
And she was his lover.
Caroline Sullivan.
Your father was almost as obsessed with her as he was with the Candyman.
Why?
There was something of hers he most desperately wanted.
Her mirror.
Those who witnessed the horror said that Robitaille's suffering was so agonizing, so unbearable, that his soul became trapped in Caroline's mirror.
And my father thought he could stop him with it.
Break the mirror, break the curse.
Where's the mirror now?
Who knows?
Caroline found it next to Robitaille's body and disappeared.
There were rumors, of course.
Suicide...
Your father never believed that, though.
Let me go.
What do you want from me?
There's a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
You cannot change who you are.
Come on!
Shit.
You have a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
Oh, Paul.
Who am I?
The world is turning, brothers and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.
And I'm not the man I used to be.
I got hooves on my shoes and horns on my head.
I want life on a platter, medium rare.
And you can keep the silverware, cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.
Who's there?
Robitaille was born right here in New Orleans.
- I know.
- I called him in front of Matthew.
All slave births were registered here.
Daniel Robitaille.
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.
That's my family's house.
That's where I was born.
There's more.
If what Matthew believes is true,
I hope you can stop it.
God bless you.
They had a daughter.
Officer, they told me to make a report.
Sit down over here.
Take a look.
Take a good look.
- I can't keep doing this.
- Look!
More of your sister's handiwork.
- No!
Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!
I'm on to your sick games!
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been covering' for her all along.
You don't know what you're talkin' about!
It's him!
Who?
Your friend the Candyman?
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.
Should we call him?
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.
- Candyman.
- No, don't.
Candyman.
Candyman.
- Don't.
- Candyman.
No!
No!
No!
Stop!
I said, stop!
We were just wondering if you'd seen Mrs. Tarrant's daughter, Annie.
No, there's been no activity at all.
No!
No!
No!
God, no!
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?
No, ma'am.
Oh, Annie.
You lied to us from the beginning.
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.
No, it's not true.
It's true.
Caroline bought the house because that's where he was born.
And she raised their daughter in that house.
Your grandmother.
She was raised a white girl, and no one suspected the truth.
But Daddy did.
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.
- But you just kept on lying.
- I did it to protect you.
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have children of your own.
You'll understand.
I'll never lie to my child.
Your father was tryin' to destroy everything we had
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,
- by denying the truth.
- I am not a part of him!
- We're his family!
- No!
- We're his blood!
- I will not have you talk like that.
You can't wash him away with a bottle!
There is no Candyman.
He does not exist.
My child.
You doubted me...
your own flesh and blood.
Death is a return, you know.
Annie...
Annie, it's almost time.
Time for our journey.
Soon we'll be together, just the way I planned.
You cannot resist what is in your blood.
Our blood.
Your baby's blood.
You can't fight what is meant to be.
The choice will be yours, Annie.
I'm so sorry.
No!
Miss Tarrant!
Go on!
Quick!
Go around the back there.
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Ethan's dead.
I'm sorry.
He was shot trying to escape.
Detective Levesque's body was found... mutilated.
The guards assumed...
I watched the video tape of what happened in that room.
Ray's body was torn apart by somethin' powerful, and it wasn't your brother.
You better hurry before they get here.
29 minutes to go, New Orleans.
29 minutes till judgment.
So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.
Yeah, you're right.
I said it.
Y'all can trust the Kingfish.
The heavens have just opened up on us and the banks of the Mississippi are about to burst.
I don't think they're gonna hold it back any more.
They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.
Yeah, Mardi Gras.
Where is it?
Where is it?
God damn you!
The slave quarters.
Matthew!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
You should go home.
I knew when you called him, he'd come.
Like before.
You were hiding here.
He's in my dreams, Annie.
- I know.
- I had to see...
I wanted to see him for real.
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.
It must be down there.
Be careful.
Annie!
Go back!
Get some help, Matthew!
Annie, don't.
The mirror is the secret of my strength.
The keeper of my soul.
The destiny of our family.
Annie, our journey begins.
This is why I brought you here.
I was not always this way.
This is who I've become.
You must see what they did.
My only sin was to love Caroline, and to give her a daughter.
They took everything from me, Annie.
Let me go.
My family.
Did you think you could get away from us?
My child.
My life.
No!
Be my witness.
See how I became the reflection of their hatred.
Their evil.
Kill him!
See what it means to call me by that name.
Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Candyman, Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!
My pain was unbearable.
But Caroline's was even greater.
Let him go!
Stop her!
No!
- Father!
- Caroline.
You will all be damned.
You defiled my daughter.
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?
Candyman...
Now, do you see what was taken from me?
Yes.
No!
No!
They killed me, Annie.
But they could not destroy my soul.
Join me, Annie.
We will go together to a world without pain.
No more pain.
Death is only the beginning.
Your cradle will be your grave.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
- Annie.
Annie.
- Annie!
- Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Grab my arm, Annie!
- Annie!
- Grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Come here!
Grab my hand!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Annie, the choice is no longer yours.
You are mine.
The cradle is your grave, not mine.
No.
Go!
Let's get out of here.
Go!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Yeah, it's Lent.
So y'all take it easy.
We made it through another one, New Orleans.
And the Kingfish hope you got plenty to atone for.
Hope you all said a fond farewell to the flesh.
Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.
And we are startin' it again.
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.
That's your mommy.
She's pretty.
That's right.
And who's that?
That little girl is your great-grandma, Isabel.
And that's her mommy, Caroline.
That's my name, too.
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.
And when you get a little older, I will tell you a story about him.
- Tell me now.
- Right now, it's time for your nap.
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman,
- Cand...
- Caroline!
Go to sleep.

LECTURER:
He died for love.
Born just after the Civil War, Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves, an artist by trade.
A wealthy landowner commissioned him to paint the portrait of his daughter.
They fell in love.
She became pregnant.
Her father had his thugs chase the poor man through the town.
When they caught him, they sawed off his right hand with a rusty blade.
A nearby beehive was raided, and the honeycomb smeared over his bleeding, mutilated body.
The crowd that had gathered fled as the bees came for him.
He died for love.
His resurrection began as rumor, and grew into myth.
Say his name five times in the mirror and he would appear.
A hook had replaced his severed hand.
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.
The myth has traveled from place to place, taking root in the most desperate areas.
Even here, in New Orleans, murders have been committed in his name.
Yes, but is he real?
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1992.
Helen Lyle becomes so obsessed by the myth that she takes on the persona of Candyman, killing her victims with a hook.
Cabrini residents believe she was the Candyman.
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?
I believe in the myth.
But the fact?
The flesh and blood?
No.
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman.
Well, that is a relief.
My publisher would never have forgiven me.
Imagine the headlines:
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated with Hook on Book Tour."
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet our Candyman, Peter.
- (CRASH) - (CAT MEOWS)
Oh, I'm sorry.
These streets have got me all turned around.
We were a little shy back there, were we?
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".
Ethan Tarrant.
Ethan, I'm sorry about what happened to your father.
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea
- how many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.
I'm not saying he was.
You told him there was no Candyman.
You told him to say the name...
and now he's dead.
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.
Daniel Robitaille has been dead and buried for a very long time.
He's here.
You called him.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
You're next, Purcell.
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.
Give me a shot of single malt.
Fucking murderer!
Hey!
Get him the fuck outta here!
You're next, Purcell.
Get out!
It's... my book.
WBOV.
RADIO:
Are you with me, New Orleans?
Do ya hear me?
This is the Kingfish coming to you at 96.2 FM.
Anointed and appointed.
Just three more days, Crescent City, three days until Lent.
So let's have it, the merriment before the penance, and the feast before the fast.
The Kingfish gonna keep y'all company all the way down.
Hey, brothers and sisters, y'all know what "carnival" means in Latin?
Well, the Kingfish went to the good schools, so he can tell you all about it.
"Carnival: farewell to the flesh."
That's what it means.
I like that a lot. "Farewell to the flesh."
Yeah, you right.
And farewell to all that flooding', as far as I'm concerned.
That's right.
Look at it.
The banks of the mighty Mississippi are ready to spill their seed.
Just look at that sky out there.
It's ready to rain on us again.
And the clouds?
Well, now, brothers and sisters, they're not the only thing threatening' the Crescent City.
We're talking murder, mes amis.
Cos so we've heard before, the hook man, kerchunk.
So when you pull on your costume and turn to admire yourself in the mirror, please keep those lips locked tight.
Do not call his name.
Is he always so angry?
Guess so.
- And why do you think that is?
- Cos he's been hurt.
"Cos he's been hurt"!
Who hurt him, Matthew?
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie.
Look.
Come here.
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?
No way.
I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.
Why not?
It's not going anywhere.
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.
Annie, if there's one thing these kids understand, it's taking care of themselves.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.
Hey, Pam.
You movin' in here, or what?
No.
No, let's go.
- Howdy, Miss Tarrant.
- Hi, Greg.
(ALARM)
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Oh!
Lord, I hate that thing.
- Then why leave it on all the time?
- Annie, please.
Don't start with me.
- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Ah!
Well, he barely even spoke to me.
He only wants to see you.
Oh, Annie.
I mean, murder.
(PHONE)
- Hello, Mrs. Tarrant.
- Is that what you call a speedy response?
- Pardon me, ma'am?
- I set that alarm off 45 seconds ago.
Ma'am, we try to respond as fast as we can.
But we do need a codeword.
Codeword?
Oh, I'll give you a codeword.
- "Dickhead".
- Mother.
When you reach my age, Annie, you can say whatever the hell you want.
Does Dr. Lewis let you drink?
Dr. Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.
Says it doesn't make a difference what I do.
We'll get that taken in.
You know the only thing I regret?
I never had a chance to grow out the grey.
I can tell you the exact day I got ill.
It was the day your father died.
- Stay back.
Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?
Just stay back!
Paul!
Paul, just help my mother!
- Excuse me!
- Give us a comment!
Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.
OCTAVIA:
You are a life-saver, Paul.
He'll make a great father someday.
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.
I'd like a winter funeral...
especially with this climate.
Mrs. Tarrant?
Ma'am.
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.
I wouldn't want to upset him.
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.
Hey!
My guardian angel.
- How are you?
- Ah, I've been better.
How's Mom?
She's coping.
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?
Come on, Annie.
Law school was Dad's dream, not mine.
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.
Just tell me what happened last night.
This asshole sat down and he ordered a drink.
He started chewing' on his ice...
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!
What happened?
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.
Think I'll let some country-club pissant slip through our fingers?
The boy is getting sloppy.
The first three victims were John Does.
Until number four:
Mr. Coleman Tarrant.
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?
None other than young Ethan.
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?
Am I protecting someone?
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.
Can't help him now.
I knew kids like him in school.
Always thought they were better than me, cos they lived in some fucking mansion up on Esplanade Avenue.
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.
Don't you get it, Annie?
I did it.
I confessed.
End of story.
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin' Mardi Gras with my husband after all.
I know what this is about.
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished, even when they've done nothing wrong.
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.
You were just in the house that night.
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!
I said, leave it alone!
- Damn!
- Time's up.
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No!
No!
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant, but this is an open-and-shut case.
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.
Look, we're talking about more than Dr. Purcell's murder here.
What are you saying?
It's possible that Ethan was involved in your father's death as well.
They were killed in exactly the same way.
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.
My brother didn't do this.
We'll see.
KINGFISH:
This is going out to the man with the hook.
Hey, man, chill.
Relax.
Have some gumbo or somethin'.
Even the Kingfish know when to draw the line.
Going somewhere, Ben?
- Oh, yeah.
I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh.
He's got to do the do.
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.
You're a lightweight.
Do you think a family can be cursed?
When we were growing up, we thought we were the luckiest kids in the world.
Ethan was so smart.
Daddy thought he'd be the first Tarrant in the Supreme Court.
But when he died, there was this... cloud.
Annie.
Annie!
You gotta start thinkin' of the good things in life.
You got a whole classroom full of kids who give a damn because of you.
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.
At least, your mama thinks so.
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.
Hey!
Get the hell outta here!
Goddamn tourist.
Gotta do the do.
Hm?
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me.
It's lookin' good.
I just can't seem to finish it.
ANNIE:
The happy family.
We'll do better.
I promise.
Daddy loved this house.
Even after we moved out, he'd always drive us past it.
It was as if he was drawn to it.
KINGFISH:
Are you with me, Crescent City?
Do you feel it comin' on?
When the Catholic Church realized they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways,
- they invited...
- (SWITCHES OFF RADIO)
- What's that for?
- Just in case.
- (SWITCHES ON CAR ALARM)
- That's a good idea, honey.
Jesus.
This explains a lot.
Paul, I haven't lived here for 13 years.
Annie!
- I don't think we're alone.
- (CLINKING)
Oh...
You scared the hell out of me.
Keep your fucking hands off my things.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to get in your way.
Goddamn fool.
- Just like the others.
- Paul.
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.
You see, I used to live here.
I'm with her.
And I thought I'd met all your relatives.
No, no, no!
Annie, what are we looking for here?
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.
But it's more than that.
Follow me.
This... was my bedroom.
Oh, this is nice.
Ah, see?
You got the room with the view.
Those were the old slave quarters.
Ethan and I were never allowed to play there.
It happened in there.
Ow!
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.
(BARKING)
Hey!
What are you doing?
Goddammit.
(ALARM BLEEPS)
Hey, come on, guys.
Come on.
Would you relax?
Let's go.
Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.
Right now, those kids are the only thing that's keeping me sane.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- I'll see you later.
- OK.
Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.
Boys...
Liz, what's his name?
Stop this!
Why are you doing this?
Drew, Matt, stop it!
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.
Wait a second.
Stop it.
What is the problem?
Matthew!
Drew!
Now stop it!
- What is going on?
- He started it.
- Liar.
- He did.
Look.
Matthew?
What is it?
It's the Candyman.
They killed him.
Listen, guys.
There's no such thing as a Candyman.
It's just a story, a really scary story.
And these come from Matthew's imagination.
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...
Sometimes there are people in this world that do bad things.
Horrible things.
When they don't get caught, we blame imaginary monsters for their crimes.
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.
Five times.
If you say his name five times, he's supposed to come.
You guys don't really believe that, do you?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to prove it, then.
Here goes.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
ANNIE:
You see?
Nothing happened.
(BUZZING)
I can't believe you actually did that.
It was the only way I could convince them.
And maybe yourself?
- What does that mean?
- I think you know.
What?
Are you ready for dessert?
Again?
Come on.
There are no monsters.
(HUMS)
Shit!
Do you need any help out there?
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.
Paul?
Annie.
Annie.
I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom.
Annie,
I came for you.
Ready or not...
Paul...
We have a journey to make, you and I.
McKeever negotiates the steps, saves the dessert.
What a guy!
(TRAY CRASHES)
Annie, be with me.
You're mine.
Mardi Gras... every night's like a full moon.
If you ask me, that family won the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.
Give it a rest, Ray.
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.
It was him.
Him?
Who is "him"?
He just came out of the shadows.
He had this hook that came out of his arm, and bees were crawling out of his face.
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras.
Now, if you saw some kind of freak in a costume...
It wasn't a mask.
- He's real.
- Of course.
What about my brother?
There's no reason to think your husband's murder...
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.
Well, if he is, then that just leaves you, doesn't it?
Oh, Annie.
Annie.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, thank heavens... (WHISPERS) She's lyin'.
I'm here, honey.
We're almost home, honey.
Here.
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.
Why did Daddy go to the house that night?
- What did he know?
- Annie, please.
You should rest.
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
Just go to sleep.
That's what you need.
That's what we all need.
KINGFISH:
Today is the day, New Orleans.
It's Mardi Gras.
And time is already running' out.
When the clock strikes midnight, when good ol' Comus greets Rex, when the police on their horses come to sweep us out of the Quarter, it, mes amis, is histoire.
(TAPPING ON WINDOWPANE)
- Annie.
- No.
You brought me here.
You killed Paul.
Swallow your horror, and let it nourish you.
Come with me, and sing the song of misery.
Share my world,
Annie.
No!
Annie!
It's all right.
It's all right.
You were just dreamin'.
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.
We leave life just like we came in.
Alone?
Naked, blind, and covered in our own shit.
Oh, no, but not me.
I'm goin' in my prom dress.
The Lord knows it fits again.
(PHONE)
You rest.
I'll get that.
I don't care what they say.
Tell them she's ill.
Tell them they should be in school, for God's sake.
Who is it?
It's no one, Annie.
Why don't you just go back up to bed?
Send them up.
Here?
(BOTH SPEAK AT ONCE)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.
Now, tell me exactly what happened.
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if?
KINGFISH:
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.
We are eatin' the meat raw.
I tell ya what.
I'm not goin' home till this is over.
I'm on the air full time.
Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.
Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.
Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis, and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.
- Who you lookin' for?
- I'm Matthew's teacher.
- I'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.
- Please.
I wanna help.
- Help?
We've had way too much of that already.
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?
I always worried about him being on the street after dark, but... he didn't want his daddy tagging' along when he went to buy his paints, so...
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?
The police don't give a damn.
They figure, one less drug dealer or potential murderer to worry about.
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.
Ever since his mother died, he's been having nightmares.
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.
- It's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them?
The paintings.
He calls this his studio.
Oh, Lord.
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.
But how did it happen to Matthew?
I see it every day.
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.
But what if it's true?
What if the Candyman does exist?
Then only God can save us.
Come on, guys, let's go home.
No, I'm gettin' this up.
- Come on.
Come on, guys.
- I'm tryin' to do this.
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.
Damn.
What do you want me to do?
Bees got him.
You will all be punished.
(LAUGHTER)
Even you.
KINGFISH:
That's right, New Orleans, it's Mardi Gras.
It's Fat Tuesday, and I am fat.
My belt is broken, my pants are open, my belly is a mountain of love stuffed with oysters.
And y'all know what tomorrow is.
Ash Wednesday.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I just stood there and watched Paul die.
And now Matthew.
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.
Oh, Jesus.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.
You and Mom.
But it wasn't enough.
- It'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?
What was Daddy doing there?
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.
You weren't around to see how obsessed he became.
I mean, all Dad ever talked about was callin' the...
Callin' him.
It got so bad, I was afraid to leave him alone.
But, that night, he got away from me.
I knew exactly where he'd go.
He'd been goin' to the house every night.
(BLOODCURDLING SCREAM)
I blew it, Annie.
- If I'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why?
Why did he call him?
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.
- What has our family got to do with this?
- I don't know.
Dad wouldn't tell me.
Before he died, he got in touch with this guy who trafficked in black market stuff.
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?
- He won't talk to ya.
I tried.
- His name.
Thibideaux.
He's in the Quarter.
No, don't go.
It's too dangerous.
- I must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.
There isn't time.
Besides, you'll be safe here.
There's always someone watching.
- I think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, get it where it's dripping' there.
- I'm gonna try.
Would you care for something sweet?
A small snowball, please.
Cherry?
Cherry would be fine.
Sweets for the sweet.
Would you like something else?
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted with anybody by that name.
- It's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.
He's dead.
He was murdered.
Coleman Tarrant.
Clara, why don't you run on ahead to that party and I'll meet you over there, OK?
I'll have you know, Honoré, I intend to collect on that drink you promised me.
HONORÉ:
Oh, yeah, baby.
I'm countin' on it.
Hello.
You wait here.
I'm gonna take a look.
Your father understood the difference between history and age.
Some pieces are merely old.
Others have history.
And history, because it reflects life, is not always pretty.
It eats, it... if you'll pardon the expression... shits.
Most of the objects your father sought held history within them.
Your father found out that the Candyman was born here in New Orleans.
His name was Daniel Robitaille.
And she was his lover.
Caroline Sullivan.
Your father was almost as obsessed with her as he was with the Candyman.
Why?
There was something of hers he most desperately wanted.
Her mirror.
Those who witnessed the horror said that Robitaille's suffering was so agonizing, so unbearable, that his soul became trapped in Caroline's mirror.
And my father thought he could stop him with it.
Break the mirror, break the curse.
Where's the mirror now?
Who knows?
Caroline found it next to Robitaille's body and disappeared.
There were rumors, of course.
Suicide...
Your father never believed that, though.
Let me go.
(BUZZING)
What do you want from me?
There's a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
You cannot change who you are.
(YELLING)
(WHISTLES)
Come on!
Shit.
You have a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
Oh, Paul.
Who am I?
(CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER)
KINGFISH:
The world is turning, brothers and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.
And I'm not the man I used to be.
I got hooves on my shoes and horns on my head.
I want life on a platter, medium rare.
And you can keep the silverware, cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.
Who's there?
Robitaille was born right here in New Orleans.
- I know.
- I called him in front of Matthew.
All slave births were registered here.
Daniel Robitaille.
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.
That's my family's house.
That's where I was born.
There's more.
If what Matthew believes is true,
I hope you can stop it.
God bless you.
They had a daughter.
Officer, they told me to make a report.
Sit down over here.
Take a look.
Take a good look.
- I can't keep doing this.
- Look!
More of your sister's handiwork.
- No!
Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!
I'm on to your sick games!
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been covering' for her all along.
You don't know what you're talkin' about!
It's him!
Who?
Your friend the Candyman?
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.
Should we call him?
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.
- Candyman.
- No, don't.
Candyman.
Candyman.
- Don't.
- Candyman.
No!
No!
No!
Stop!
I said, stop!
(SIRENS)
We were just wondering if you'd seen Mrs. Tarrant's daughter, Annie.
No, there's been no activity at all.
No!
No!
No!
God, no!
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?
No, ma'am.
Oh, Annie.
You lied to us from the beginning.
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.
No, it's not true.
It's true.
Caroline bought the house because that's where he was born.
And she raised their daughter in that house.
Your grandmother.
She was raised a white girl, and no one suspected the truth.
But Daddy did.
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.
- But you just kept on lying.
- I did it to protect you.
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have children of your own.
You'll understand.
I'll never lie to my child.
Your father was tryin' to destroy everything we had
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,
- by denying the truth.
- I am not a part of him!
- We're his family!
- No!
- We're his blood!
- I will not have you talk like that.
You can't wash him away with a bottle!
There is no Candyman.
He does not exist.
My child.
You doubted me...
your own flesh and blood.
Death is a return, you know.
Annie...
Annie, it's almost time.
Time for our journey.
Soon we'll be together, just the way I planned.
You cannot resist what is in your blood.
Our blood.
Your baby's blood.
You can't fight what is meant to be.
The choice will be yours, Annie.
I'm so sorry.
No!
Miss Tarrant!
(BANGING)
Go on!
Quick!
Go around the back there.
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Ethan's dead.
I'm sorry.
He was shot trying to escape.
Detective Levesque's body was found... mutilated.
The guards assumed...
I watched the video tape of what happened in that room.
Ray's body was torn apart by somethin' powerful, and it wasn't your brother.
You better hurry before they get here.
KINGFISH: 29 minutes to go, New Orleans.
29 minutes till judgment.
So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.
Yeah, you're right.
I said it.
Y'all can trust the Kingfish.
The heavens have just opened up on us and the banks of the Mississippi are about to burst.
I don't think they're gonna hold it back any more.
They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.
Yeah, Mardi Gras.
Where is it?
Where is it?
God damn you!
The slave quarters.
Matthew!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
You should go home.
I knew when you called him, he'd come.
Like before.
You were hiding here.
He's in my dreams, Annie.
- I know.
- I had to see...
I wanted to see him for real.
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.
It must be down there.
Be careful.
Annie!
Go back!
Get some help, Matthew!
Annie, don't.
The mirror is the secret of my strength.
The keeper of my soul.
The destiny of our family.
Annie, our journey begins.
This is why I brought you here.
I was not always this way.
This is who I've become.
You must see what they did.
My only sin was to love Caroline, and to give her a daughter.
They took everything from me, Annie.
Let me go.
My family.
Did you think you could get away from us?
My child.
My life.
No!
Be my witness.
See how I became the reflection of their hatred.
Their evil.
WOMAN:
Kill him!
See what it means to call me by that name.
Candyman.
- Candyman.
- (ALL CHANT) Candyman, Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!
My pain was unbearable.
But Caroline's was even greater.
Let him go!
Stop her!
No!
- Father!
- Caroline.
You will all be damned.
You defiled my daughter.
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?
Candyman...
Now, do you see what was taken from me?
Yes.
No!
No!
They killed me, Annie.
But they could not destroy my soul.
Join me, Annie.
We will go together to a world without pain.
No more pain.
Death is only the beginning.
Your cradle will be your grave.
- Annie.
- OCTAVIA:
Annie.
- PAUL:
Annie.
- Annie.
- PAUL:
Annie.
- ETHAN:
Annie.
- OCTAVIA:
Annie.
- PAUL:
Annie.
CANDYMAN:
Annie.
(THUNDER)
- MATTHEW:
Annie!
- ALL:
Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Grab my arm, Annie!
- Annie!
- DREW:
Grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Come here!
Grab my hand!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Annie, the choice is no longer yours.
You are mine.
The cradle is your grave, not mine.
No.
Go!
Let's get out of here.
Go!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
KINGFISH:
Yeah, it's Lent.
So y'all take it easy.
We made it through another one, New Orleans.
And the Kingfish hope you got plenty to atone for.
Hope you all said a fond farewell to the flesh.
Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.
And we are startin' it again.
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.
That's your mommy.
She's pretty.
That's right.
And who's that?
That little girl is your great-grandma, Isabel.
And that's her mommy, Caroline.
That's my name, too.
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.
And when you get a little older, I will tell you a story about him.
- Tell me now.
- Uh-uh.
Right now, it's time for your nap.
(TINKLING)
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman,
- Cand...
- Caroline!
Go to sleep.
Visiontext Subtitles:
Marisa Castle de Joncaire
Born just after the Civil War, Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves, an artist by trade.
A wealthy landowner commissioned him to paint the portrait of his daughter.
They fell in love.
She became pregnant.
Her father had his thugs chase the poor man through the town.
When they caught him, they sawed off his right hand with a rusty blade.
A nearby beehive was raided, and the honeycomb smeared over his bleeding, mutilated body.
The crowd that had gathered fled as the bees came for him.
He died for love.
His resurrection began as rumour, and grew into myth.
Say his name five times in the mirror and he would appear.
A hook had replaced his severed hand.
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.
The myth has travelled from place to place, taking root in the most desperate areas.
Even here, in New Orleans, murders have been committed in his name.
Yes, but is he real?
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1 992.
Helen Lyle becomes so obsessed by the myth that she takes on the persona of Candyman, killing her victims with a hook.
Cabrini residents believe she was the Candyman.
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?
I believe in the myth.
But the fact?
The flesh and blood?
No.
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman,
Candyman.
Well, that is a relief.
My publisher would never have forgiven me.
Imagine the headlines:
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated with Hook on Book Tour."
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet our Candyman, Peter.
- (crash) - (cat miaows)
Oh, I'm sorry.
These streets have got me all turned around.
We were a little shy back there, were we?
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".
Ethan Tarrant.
Ethan, I'm sorry about what happened to your father.
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea
- How many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.
I'm not saying he was.
You told him there was no Candyman.
You told him to say the name - and now he's dead.
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.
Daniel Robitaille has been dead and buried for a very long time.
He's here.
You called him.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
You're next, Purcell.
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.
Give me a shot of single malt.
Fucking murderer!
Hey!
Get him the fuck outta here!
You're next, Purcell.
Get out!
It's... my book.
" WBOV
(radio) Are you with me, New Orleans?
Do ya hear me?
This is the Kingfish coming to you at 96.2 FM.
Anointed and appointed.
Just three more days, Crescent City, three days until Lent.
So let's have it, the merriment before the penance, and the feast before the fast.
The Kingfish gonna keep y'all company all the way down.
Hey, brothers and sisters, y'all know what "carnival" means in Latin?
Well, the Kingfish went to the good schools, so he can tell you all about it.
"Carnival.
Farewell to the flesh. "
That's what it means.
I like that a lot. "Farewell to the flesh. "
Yeah, you right.
And farewell to all that flooding', as far as I'm concerned.
That's right.
Look at it.
The banks of the mighty Mississippi are ready to spill their seed.
Just look at that sky out there.
It's ready to rain on us again.
And the clouds?
Well, now, brothers and sisters, they're not the only thing threatening' the Crescent City.
We're talking murder, mes amis.
Coœ so we've heard before, the hook man, kerchunk.
So when you pull on your costume and turn to admire yourself in the mirror, please keep those lips locked tight.
Do not call his name.
Is he always so angry?
Guess so.
- And why do you think that is?
- Coœ he's been hurt.
"Coœ he's been hurt"(!
)
Who hurt him, Matthew?
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie.
Look.
Come here.
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?
No way.
I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.
Why not?
It's not going anywhere.
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.
Annie, if there's one thing these kids understand, it's taking care of themselves.
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.
Hey, Pam.
You movin' in here, or what?
No.
No, let's go.
- Howdy, Miss Tarrant.
- Hi, Greg.
(alarm)
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Oh!
Lord, I hate that thing.
- Then why leave it on all the time?
- Annie, please.
Don't start with me.
- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Ah!
Well, he barely even spoke to me.
He only wants to see you.
Oh, Annie.
I mean, murder.
(phone)
- Hello, Mrs Tarrant.
- Is that what you call a speedy response?
- Pardon me, ma'am?
- I set that alarm off 45 seconds ago.
Ma'am, we try to respond as fast as we can.
But we do need a codeword.
Codeword?
Oh, I'll give you a codeword.
- "Dickhead".
- Mother.
When you reach my age, Annie, you can say whatever the hell you want.
Does Dr Lewis let you drink?
Dr Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.
Says it doesn't make a difference what I do.
We'll get that taken in.
You know the only thing I regret?
I never had a chance to grow out the grey.
I can tell you the exact day I got ill.
It was the day your father died.
- Stay back.
Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?
Just stay back!
Paul!
Paul, just help my mother!
- Excuse me!
- Give us a comment!
Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.
(Octavia) You are a life-saver, Paul.
He'll make a great father someday.
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.
I'd like a winter funeral - especially with this climate.
Mrs Tarrant?
Ma'am.
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.
I wouldn't want to upset him.
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.
Hey!
My guardian angel.
- How are you?
- Ah, I've been better.
How's Mom?
She's coping.
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?
Come on, Annie.
Law school was Dad's dream, not mine.
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.
Just tell me what happened last night.
This asshole sat down and he ordered a drink.
He started chewing' on his ice...
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!
What happened?
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.
Think I'll let some country-club pissant slip through our fingers?
The boy is getting sloppy.
The first three victims were John Does.
Until number four:
Mr Coleman Tarrant.
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?
None other than young Ethan.
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?
Am I protecting someone?
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.
Can't help him now.
I knew kids like him in school.
Always thought they were better than me, cos they lived in some fucking mansion up on Esplanade Avenue.
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.
Don't you get it, Annie?
I did it.
I confessed.
End of story.
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin' Mardi Gras with my husband after all.
I know what this is about.
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished, even when they've done nothing wrong.
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.
You were just in the house that night.
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!
I said, leave it alone!
- Damn!
- Time's up.
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No!
No!
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant, but this is an open-and-shut case.
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.
Look, we're talking about more than Dr Purcell's murder here.
What are you saying?
It's possible that Ethan was involved in your father's death as well.
They were killed in exactly the same way.
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.
My brother didn't do this.
We'll see.
(Kingfish) This is going out to the man with the hook.
Hey, man, chill.
Relax.
Have some gumbo or somethin'.
Even the Kingfish know when to draw the line.
Going somewhere, Ben?
- Oh, yeah.
I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh.
He's got to do the do.
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.
You're a lightweight.
Do you think a family can be cursed?
When we were growing up, we thought we were the luckiest kids in the world.
Ethan was so smart.
Daddy thought he'd be the first Tarrant in the Supreme Court.
But when he died, there was this... cloud.
Annie.
Annie!
You gotta start thinkin' of the good things in life.
You got a whole classroom full of kids who give a damn because of you.
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.
At least, your mama thinks so.
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.
Hey!
Get the hell outta here!
Goddamn tourist.
Gotta do the do.
Hm?
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me.
It's lookin' good.
I just can't seem to finish it.
(Annie) The happy family.
We'll do better.
I promise.
Daddy loved this house.
Even after we moved out, he'd always drive us past it.
It was as if he was drawn to it.
(Kingfish) Are you with me, Crescent City?
Do you feel it comin' on?
When the Catholic Church realised they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways,
- They invited...
- (switches off radio)
- What's that for?
- Just in case.
- (switches on car alarm)
- That's a good idea, honey.
Jesus.
This explains a lot.
Paul, I haven't lived here for 1 3 years.
Annie!
- I don't think we're alone.
- (clinking)
Oh...
You scared the hell out of me.
Keep your fucking hands off my things.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to get in your way.
Goddamn fool.
- Just like the others.
- Paul.
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.
You see, I used to live here.
I'm with her.
And I thought I'd met all your relatives.
No, no, no!
Annie, what are we looking for here?
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.
But it's more than that.
Follow me.
This... was my bedroom.
Oh, this is nice.
Ah, see?
You got the room with the view.
Those were the old slave quarters.
Ethan and I were never allowed to play there.
It happened in there.
Ow!
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.
(barking)
Hey!
What are you doing?
Goddammit.
(alarm bleeps)
Hey, come on, guys.
Come on.
Would you relax?
Let's go.
Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.
Right now, those kids are the only thing that's keeping me sane.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- I'll see you later.
- OK.
Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.
Boys...
Liz, what's his name?
Stop this!
Why are you doing this?
Drew, Matt, stop it!
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.
Wait a second.
Stop it.
What is the problem?
Matthew!
Drew!
Now stop it!
- What is going on?
- He started it.
- Liar.
- He did.
Look.
Matthew?
What is it?
It's the Candyman.
They killed him.
Listen, guys.
There's no such thing as a Candyman.
It's just a story, a really scary story.
And these come from Matthew's imagination.
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...
Sometimes there are people in this world that do bad things.
Horrible things.
When they don't get caught, we blame imaginary monsters for their crimes.
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.
Five times.
If you say his name five times, he's supposed to come.
You guys don't really believe that, do you?
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to prove it, then.
Here goes.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
Candyman.
(Annie) You see?
Nothing happened.
(buzzing)
I can't believe you actually did that.
It was the only way I could convince them.
And maybe yourself?
- What does that mean?
- l think you know.
What?
Are you ready for dessert?
Again?
Come on.
There are no monsters.
(hums)
Shit!
Do you need any help out there?
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.
Paul?
Annie.
Annie.
I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom.
Annie, I came for you.
Ready or not...
Paul...
We have a journey to make, you and I.
McKeever negotiates the steps, saves the dessert.
What a guy!
(tray crashes)
Annie, be with me.
You're mine.
Mardi Gras - every night's like a full moon.
If you ask me, that family won the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.
Give it a rest, Ray.
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.
It was him.
Him?
Who is "him"?
He just came out of the shadows.
He had this hook that came out of his arm, and bees were crawling out of his face.
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras.
Now, if you saw some kind of freak in a costume... lt wasn't a mask.
- He's real.
- Of course.
What about my brother?
There's no reason to think your husband's murder...
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.
Well, if he is, then that just leaves you, doesn't it?
Oh, Annie.
Annie.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, Mom.
Oh, thank heavens... (whispers) She's lyin'.
I'm here, honey.
We're almost home, honey.
Here.
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.
Why did Daddy go to the house that night?
- What did he know?
- Annie, please.
You should rest.
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
Just go to sleep.
That's what you need.
That's what we all need.
(Kingfish) Today is the day, New Orleans. lt's Mardi Gras.
And time is already running' out.
When the clock strikes midnight, when good ol' Comus greets Rex, when the police on their horses come to sweep us out of the Quarter, it, mes amis, is histoire.
(tapping on windowpane)
- Annie.
- No.
You brought me here.
You killed Paul.
Swallow your horror, and let it nourish you.
Come with me, and sing the song of misery.
Share my world,
Annie.
No!
Annie!
It's all right. lt's all right.
You were just dreamin'.
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.
We leave life just like we came in.
- Alone?
- Naked, blind, and covered in our own shit.
Oh, no, but not me.
I'm goin' in my prom dress.
The Lord knows it fits again.
(phone)
You rest. I'll get that.
I don't care what they say.
Tell them she's ill.
Tell them they should be in school, for God's sake.
Who is it?
It's no one, Annie.
Why don't you just go back up to bed?
Send them up.
Here?
(both speak at once)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.
Now, tell me exactly what happened.
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if...?
(Kingfish) Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.
We are eatin' the meat raw.
I tell ya what. I'm not goin' home till this is over.
I'm on the air full time.
Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.
Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.
Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis, and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.
- Who you lookin' for?
- l'm Matthew's teacher.
- l'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.
- Please. I wanna help.
- Help?
We've had way too much of that already.
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?
I always worried about him being on the street after dark, but... he didn't want his daddy tagging' along when he went to buy his paints, so...
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?
The police don't give a damn.
They figure, one less drug dealer or potential murderer to worry about.
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.
Ever since his mother died, he's been having nightmares.
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.
- lt's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them?
The paintings.
He calls this his studio.
Oh, Lord.
Did he ever mention the Candyman?
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.
But how did it happen to Matthew?
I see it every day.
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.
But what if it's true?
What if the Candyman does exist?
Then only God can save us.
Come on, guys, let's go home.
No, I'm gettin' this up.
- Come on.
Come on, guys.
- l'm tryin' to do this.
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.
Damn.
What do you want me to do?
Bees got him.
You will all be punished.
(laughter)
Even you.
(Kingfish) That's right, New Orleans, it's Mardi Gras.
It's Fat Tuesday, and I am fat.
My belt is broken, my pants are open, my belly is a mountain of love stuffed with oysters.
And y'all know what tomorrow is.
Ash Wednesday.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
I just stood there and watched Paul die.
And now Matthew.
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.
Oh, Jesus.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- l wanted to protect you.
You and Mom.
But it wasn't enough.
- lt'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?
What was Daddy doing there?
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.
You weren't around to see how obsessed he became.
I mean, all Dad ever talked about was callin' the...
Callin' him. lt got so bad, I was afraid to leave him alone.
But, that night, he got away from me.
I knew exactly where he'd go.
He'd been goin' to the house every night.
(bloodcurdling scream)
I blew it, Annie.
- lf l'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why?
Why did he call him?
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.
- What has our family got to do with this?
- l don't know.
Dad wouldn't tell me.
Before he died, he got in touch with this guy who trafficked in black market stuff.
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?
- He won't talk to ya. I tried.
- His name.
Thibideaux.
He's in the Quarter.
No, don't go. lt's too dangerous.
- l must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.
There isn't time.
Besides, you'll be safe here.
There's always someone watching.
- l think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, get it where it's dripping' there.
- l'm gonna try.
Would you care for something sweet?
A small snowball, please.
Cherry?
Cherry would be fine.
Sweets for the sweet.
Would you like something else?
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted with anybody by that name.
- lt's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.
He's dead.
He was murdered.
Coleman Tarrant.
Clara, why don't you run on ahead to that party and I'll meet you over there, OK?
I'll have you know, Honore, I intend to collect on that drink you promised me.
(Honore) Oh, yeah, baby.
I'm countin' on it.
Hello.
You wait here.
I'm gonna take a look.
Your father understood the difference between history and age.
Some pieces are merely old.
Others have history.
And history, because it reflects life, is not always pretty.
It eats, it - if you'll pardon the expression - shits.
Most of the objects your father sought held history within them.
Your father found out that the Candyman was born here in New Orleans.
His name was Daniel Robitaille.
And she was his lover.
Caroline Sullivan.
Your father was almost as obsessed with her as he was with the Candyman.
Why?
There was something of hers he most desperately wanted.
Her mirror.
Those who witnessed the horror said that Robitaille's suffering was so agonising, so unbearable, that his soul became trapped in Caroline's mirror.
And my father thought he could stop him with it.
Break the mirror, break the curse.
Where's the mirror now?
Who knows?
Caroline found it next to Robitaille's body and disappeared.
There were rumours, of course.
Suicide...
Your father never believed that, though.
Let me go.
(buzzing)
What do you want from me?
There's a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
You cannot change who you are.
(yelling)
(whistles)
Come on!
Shit.
You have a life that grows inside you now.
A daughter.
Oh, Paul.
Who am I?
(children's laughter)
(Kingfish) The world is turning, brothers and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.
And I'm not the man I used to be.
I got hooves on my shoes and horns on my head.
I want life on a platter, medium rare.
And you can keep the silverware, cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.
Who's there?
Robitaille was born right here in New Orleans.
- l know.
- l called him in front of Matthew.
All slave births were registered here.
Daniel Robitaille.
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.
That's my family's house.
That's where l was born.
There's more.
If what Matthew believes is true, I hope you can stop it.
God bless you.
They had a daughter.
Officer, they told me to make a report.
Sit down over here.
Take a look.
Take a good look.
- l can't keep doing this.
- Look!
More of your sister's handiwork.
- No!
Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!
I'm on to your sick games!
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been covering' for her all along.
You don't know what you're talkin' about!
It's him!
Who?
Your friend the Candyman?
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.
Should we call him?
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.
- Candyman.
- No, don't.
Candyman.
Candyman.
- Don't.
- Candyman.
No!
No!
No!
Stop!
I said, stop!
(sirens)
We were just wondering if you'd seen Mrs Tarrant's daughter, Annie.
No, there's been no activity at all.
No!
No!
No!
God, no!
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?
No, ma'am.
Oh, Annie.
You lied to us from the beginning.
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.
No, it's not true.
It's true.
Caroline bought the house because that's where he was born.
And she raised their daughter in that house.
Your grandmother.
She was raised a white girl, and no one suspected the truth.
But Daddy did.
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.
- But you just kept on lying.
- l did it to protect you.
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have children of your own.
You'll understand.
I'll never lie to my child.
Your father was tryin' to destroy everything we had
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,
- by denying the truth.
- l am not a part of him!
- We're his family!
- No!
- We're his blood!
- l will not have you talk like that.
You can't wash him away with a bottle!
There is no Candyman.
He does not exist.
My child.
You doubted me - your own flesh and blood.
Death is a return, you know.
Annie...
Annie, it's almost time.
Time for our journey.
Soon we'll be together, just the way I planned.
You cannot resist what is in your blood.
Our blood.
Your baby's blood.
You can't fight what is meant to be.
The choice will be yours, Annie.
I'm so sorry.
No!
Miss Tarrant!
(banging)
Go on!
Quick!
Go around the back there.
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Ethan's dead.
I'm sorry.
He was shot trying to escape.
Detective Levesque's body was found... mutilated.
The guards assumed... I watched the video tape of what happened in that room.
Ray's body was torn apart by somethin' powerful, and it wasn't your brother.
You better hurry before they get here.
(Kingfish) 29 minutes to go, New Orleans.
29 minutes till judgment.
So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.
Yeah, you're right. I said it.
Y'all can trust the Kingfish.
The heavens have just opened up on us and the banks of the Mississippi are about to burst.
I don't think they're gonna hold it back any more.
They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.
Yeah, Mardi Gras.
Where is it?
Where is it?
God damn you!
The slave quarters.
Matthew!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
You should go home.
I knew when you called him, he'd come.
Like before.
You were hiding here.
He's in my dreams, Annie.
- l know.
- l had to see... I wanted to see him for real.
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.
It must be down there.
Be careful.
Annie!
Go back!
Get some help, Matthew!
Annie, don't.
The mirror is the secret of my strength.
The keeper of my soul.
The destiny of our family.
Annie, our journey begins.
This is why I brought you here.
I was not always this way.
This is who I've become.
You must see what they did.
My only sin was to love Caroline, and to give her a daughter.
They took everything from me, Annie.
Let me go.
My family.
Did you think you could get away from us?
My child.
My life.
No!
Be my witness.
See how I became the reflection of their hatred.
Their evil.
(woman) Kill him!
See what it means to call me by that name.
Candyman.
- Candyman.
- (all chant) Candyman, Candyman.
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!
My pain was unbearable.
But Caroline's was even greater.
Let him go!
Stop her!
No!
- Father!
- Caroline.
You will all be damned.
You defiled my daughter.
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?
Candyman...
Now, do you see what was taken from me?
Yes.
No!
No!
They killed me, Annie.
But they could not destroy my soul.
Join me, Annie.
We will go together to a world without pain.
No more pain.
Death is only the beginning.
Your cradle will be your grave.
- Annie.
- (Octavia) Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
- Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
- (Ethan) Annie.
- (Octavia) Annie.
- (Paul) Annie.
(Candyman) Annie.
(thunder)
- (Matthew) Annie!
- (all) Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Grab my arm, Annie!
- Annie!
- (Drew) Grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Come here!
Grab my hand!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Annie, the choice is no longer yours.
You are mine.
The cradle is your grave, not mine.
No.
Go!
Let's get out of here.
Go!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
(Kingfish) Yeah, it's Lent.
So y'all take it easy.
We made it through another one, New Orleans.
And the Kingfish hope you got plenty to atone for.
Hope you all said a fond farewell to the flesh.
Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.
And we are startin' it again.
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.
That's your mommy.
She's pretty.
That's right.
And who's that?
That little girl is your great-grandma, Isabel.
And that's her mommy, Caroline.
That's my name, too.
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.
And when you get a little older, I will tell you a story about him.
- Tell me now.
- Uh-uh.
Right now, it's time for your nap.
(tinkling)
Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman,
- Cand...
- Caroline!
Go to sleep.
Hey.
You awake?
Maybe we could go to the movie theater with the big chairs that rock back and forth.
It's more expensive, but it's worth it.
They serve salads.
We need windex.
Hi.
Did I leave a box of huggies over here?
I'm out.
Left shelf in the pantry.
Your hair looks nice.
I used the shampoo sample in the newspaper.
Thanks.
I don't know where your jacket is, Teenie.
We've looked everywhere.
Why don't you wear something else?
I can't, it's blue day!
There's no such thing as blue day!
- Mom!
- Wayne, put that down!
Dear heavenly Father, bless our family and please help me find my jacket, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Sarah, you want to go to the mall with me after school?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I have to work.
- Morning!
- Hi, mom.
Here's your juicer.
You fixed it?
It was the on-off switch.
You look nice for a bunch of second graders.
Oh.
Um, thank you.
She used a sample from the newspaper, can you believe that?
Did Bill leave for work already?
Uh, I don't think so, no.
Ben?
Ben!
Yeah!
Hurry, eat.
Hey, Ben?
Do you want to go to the mall with me after school?
I've got baseball practice.
How's seminary?
Made friends with the other brainwashees?
Don't call them brainwashed.
Why not?
I don't like it.
Oh, good.
You still have an opinion.
- Hey, morning', everybody.
- Morning, daddy.
- Morning.
- Morning, dad.
Bill, you can't eat just pastry.
Have some orange juice.
Thanks.
- One.
- Perfect.
Come on, we've got to go.
I'm gonna be late.
- I'm not finished yet.
- We're still eating.
Barb, go.
Go ahead.
I'll give the kids a lift.
Um... uh, well, thanks.
All right, I'm off.
I'm off.
Bye.
You guys have a great day.
See ya.
- Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.
Do you want to go to the mall with mommy?
Hmm?
So what's the time-frame?
Well, we're thinkin' third store this year, a fourth next.
We haven't landed there yet, but we're working the numbers aggressively.
You asked for fresh.
We're thinking we need to move beyond Bill Henrickson, the face of Home Plus, and make Home Plus the face of Utah.
Grace Ann, you wanna take it from there?
Gentlemen...
Bill, your market is dominated by the big boys--
Home Depot, Lowe's, Wal-Mart.
Not a friendly group.
No, sir, not the warm and fuzzies.
But you do have a potential edge.
You're home-grown, based here, Salt Lake.
- Well, we do like to support our own.
- Exactly.
Message:
You're one of us, they're not.
Now, you need to let your customers know you're one of them.
Nothin' like feeling you belong.
Paul?
Salt Lake business group study.
What do you see?
Same woman?
Look closer.
This is code.
It says, "I'm wearing my garments.
I'm one of you."
That's what Utah will see, even if they're not looking.
A three-month medium-saturation market-sensitive media campaign branding Home Plus as Utah's family super store;
testimonials from employees crammed with visual clues-- subliminal.
Home Plus:
Family.
Utah:
Family.
Family:
Us.
Home Plus:
Us.
Gentlemen...
"Home Plus is us."
She's a firecracker.
I see.
Yes, it's-- it's perfect.
Oh my!
- Take off your--
- Peignoir.
- Yeah.
- Peignoir.
She sees us as the Utah store even beyond the state, an important regional retailer.
How's tuesday for you?
Teacher's conferences all afternoon.
Thursday morning?
No, zoning board.
How about tomorrow night?
Okay.
Great.
- You're on my skirt.
- Oh, sorry.
Sometimes you think something, and sometimes you dream it, but in that moment I saw it.
I saw it all coming true.
Like it was meant to happen.
Who's that?
Just Nicki.
What'd she want?
Oh, nothing.
She's... she's ovulating.
Well, I'll give up my night tonight.
- Are you sure?
- I don't mind.
- No, really.
- No, uh, I don't-
- I don't mind.
I have to go.
- See ya at home.
- Okay.
Okay.
Come in.
Papa?
Was-was there a meeting?
Yeah, sit down, Alby.
Now, the Henricksons are not your concern any longer.
I've decided to handle them myself.
- But I wa-
- I was--
- You no longer are.
- I don't understand.
- You don't need to.
It's under way.
What I want you to do is to go home, pack a small bag, and tell your wives you'll be gone for two days.
All right.
Hi, Margie!
Hi, Pam.
Goin' to the park, so I'll talk to you later.
I just got back from the market.
I got too many pears.
Want some?
Bartletts, they're so delicious.
Uh, no.
Not a big pear person.
Okay.
Mm, tell you what, when you gonna be back?
I'll drop by.
Later.
Mmm, good.
Those are missionaries.
Jacob Taggart and Erin Cullum.
I'd introduce you, but frankly, I think they've got their hands full with that one.
May we read this passage to you?
"And also to whom the only true and li--"
"And living church upon the face of the whole earth."
I got it.
Look, my children are sleeping, so it's not really convenient for me right now.
Children?
You know, we believe you can be surrounded and draw strength and love from your family for all eternity in the celestial kingdom.
We'd be happy to tell you all about that sometime.
No, this is good enough, Mr. Taggart.
We'd love to share with you the gift of the one true church.
When would it be convenient for us to return?
It wouldn't.
Who is it?
See?
Now you've woken him up.
I wasn't sleeping, mother.
Hello, little man.
Would you like a coloring book?
- Yes.
- No.
Tell me how we can do this.
The agency budgeted the campaign at over $250,000.
It's too big, Bill.
It's too much.
No, there's a vision here, and a road-map of how to get there.
She's paid to sell you on a vision.
That's how they get their jobs.
They're ad sales reps.
Peg?
It goes way beyond any responsible advertising budget based on percent of sales.
We'd have to dip into all kinds of accounts to swing it.
Is there enough, though?
Enough to get us started.
But it's a huge hit to absorb.
It ought to make you very queasy.
Bill, maybe we should do it smaller.
Halve the television spots, double the radio spots and don't run 'em at peak drive time or somethin'.
What's the point?
This is our shot.
Guys, this isn't a business expense, it's a down payment on a future.
Now they know how much they need to brand a new identy.
I don't even know why we're talking about this.
Until we're finally disentangled from Roman, we'd be fools to go forward.
How can we be the face of Utah when we're still stuck in bed with Juniper Creek?
No.
Before the week is out, that phone is gonna ring and it's gonna be Roman begging to settle.
You didn't see the fear in his eyes when I raised the hammer of bringing the attorney general down on him.
We're as good as home free.
We're doing this.
We have to.
Drive safely.
Rest tonight and rejuvenate your mind and spirit to prepare for the task ahead.
Lord, bless this servant.
Watch over him on his journey so that your work will be done through his hand tomorrow, and that all our works glorify you, in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
Amen.
Wouldn't one of the... hummers be more efficient, papa?
The buick will suffice, I think.
You're doing God's work.
Yes, sir.
Bring me Joey Henrickson... now.
Hello, sister Lois.
Not good for your teeth.
I like them.
I can have them if I want.
Yes...
I guess you can.
Do you know what's up with these dozers?
Is there some kind of construction goin' on up at the office?
By your house?
I don't think so.
Why?
They bothering you?
That one pulled up about two hours ago, sat there and started up and pulled up for some gas.
Now, who knows what it's up to?
Who sent it?
Saw one in front of your house this morning, too.
Still there, just sitting.
It's creepy.
Who knows what they want?
We also recommend you check your statements for any activity that might be fraudulent.
- Nicki?
- Just a sec!
Come on in.
Just trying to get organized.
What a mess.
Wayne got into Margene's lipstick.
Again.
I thought you were watching "Shrek."
It's over.
He drew all over her walls with it.
Wayne, you know better than this.
- I'm Bozo!
- You're in trouble is what you are.
Time-out in your room, and wash up first.
Okay.
Nicki, you can't just leave him unsupervised.
Thank you so much for telling me.
Like I don't know that.
What is the matter?
Nothing.
Nicki... what is the matter?
Just that neighbor woman Pam.
She sent missionaries to my house this morning.
Well, missionaries just show up.
No, these were sent by someone, I know it.
I just think it's dangerous, that's all.
One, two, five, four.
Front and back.
Again, let's go!
One, two, five, four.
Knee and knee.
Front and back.
Good--
- Hi!
- It's later!
Oh, is it?
Is it?
I-
- I-- the boys are asleep, so I'm exercising.
Good for you!
So, this is a little off the wall, but Carl and I are going to church tomorrow afternoon for a concert recital and wondered-- we wondered if you could come.
Oh, gosh!
I-- oh, I don't know.
I mean, everything's--
I can't-
- I don't think so.
Oh, honey, we're not trying to convert you.
It's just that, well, you seem so lonely.
You'll meet people, that's all.
No pressure.
Fun.
You're so naturally filled with the spirit, I don't know how you do it alone.
But Carl and I want to help.
We pray for you.
Oh, there I go.
That doesn't sound like fun.
You can bring the boys.
There's childcare.
That's really nice of you.
Margie.
Oh, I didn't know you had company.
I was just looking at Margene's backyard.
She was asking for some, you know, well, landscaping ideas, and, uh, I'm trying to come up with something different.
Everyone has gazebos.
Well, Carl and I just got a palapa.
I don't know where they're from-
- Thailand, Mexico-- but it's like an outdoor living room.
Mmm, that sounds so exotic.
It's heaven.
We just about live out there.
We're thinking of getting a space heater for the winter.
Well, I'll-
- I'll let you go.
Okay.
Call me.
- Bye!
- Bye.
- Margie--
- Everything's fine.
Well, Nicki seems to think that Pam sent over some missionaries to her door this morning.
She wouldn't do that.
You can't be sure.
Look, no one is saying Pam's a bad person.
Barb, I'm being really careful, so you don't have to worry about anything.
Okay.
I thought that was a really good point, the difference between lust and temptation.
Ben, it's seminary.
Jason!
Hey, do want to come with us to the mall until practice, skip last period?
Yeah, thanks.
Okay.
All right.
- Yah!
- There you are.
- We're outta here!
- Ow, you're sitting on me.
- Hello.
- You again.
Hello, ma'am.
You said something when we visited you earlier.
You quoted scripture from "doctrine and covenants."
You quote mormon scripture, yet you're not L.D.S.
We understand now.
The polygamist lifestyle is wrong, ma'am.
No, you assume you know what my religion is.
We would like to show you the way back to the one true church.
Look, I know that busybody across the street sent you, but I don't need any saving.
There's room for you, ma'am,
In the church and in our hearts, once you change.
I already told you, I am not what you think I am.
But I don't need any changing anyway.
Then we're all done here.
Wait.
Don't think I don't know what you're doing.
You're shaking the dust off your feet.
You're writing my house off for all eternity.
You're in sin, but we're not writing you off.
We're marking you down as uncooperative, not repentant.
But we'll continue to pray for you.
Go on and pray for yourselves!
You're the ones that need to be prayed for!
Go on and pray for yourselves!
It's wood.
It's wood, see?
Oh my god, Gibson's got wood.
Me too.
It's my "one mighty and strong," my "pillar of truth."
"Pencil of truth," Detweiler.
Hey, fellas, here's my "one mighty and strong."
Look, my hard-on's drivin'.
Hey, Gibson, can your dick hang a left?
Bill, your brother's on line one.
Put him through.
Joey, what's up?
Hey, Bill, uh...
Listen, there's something I gotta tell you.
Roman called me in and gave me this piece of paper.
Uh, well, actually, I'd seen it before, I guess.
I-
- I signed it a couple months ago.
You all right?
What is it?
Well, you know what?
I didn't read it close when I signed it.
I thought I was just signing a permit for a fish farm, you know?
What did you sign?
It says that I'm the designated agent for that land thing, the deseret properties, the, uh, the "non-remunerated stakeholder." I don't know.
Roman says to tell you that the first stop any attorney general will make will be at my doorstep.
I mean, is that right, Bill?
Am I gonna go to jail over this?
Oh, Joey.
Oh, man.
I'm awfully-
- I've ruined it, right?
I've ruined everything?
I'm sorry, Bill.
I'm awfully sorry.
Maybe I can help you some other way?
No no, don't worry about it.
It's gonna be okay.
Right.
Well, listen, the other thing, Roman said to tell you that his answer is comin'.
Thanks for letting me know.
Look what I found.
My blue jacket!
It's a miracle!
It was on the ground in between the houses.
How did it get there, Teenie?
I don't know.
I found a pair of Wayne's poop underwear stuffed in the sleeve.
Oh, no.
I thought he was over that.
Ever since we moved into separate houses, it's started up again.
- Nicki, he's too old for that.
- I know.
He's acting out.
I think he misses Bill.
Bill said you were ovulating, so you can have my night tonight.
Thanks, Barb.
Hi, it's Margene.
Barb, it's Ben.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a car?
Where're you headed?
No place.
Around.
Let's go.
You okay, Benny?
It was just a stupid accident.
A dog ran into the street, and they had to swerve to miss it.
Did the dog die?
Uh... no.
What type of dog was it?
Um, I don't know, Teenie.
Are you sure he's all right?
Leave your brother alone.
He's had quite a day.
Let's all just eat, folks.
I'm not really hungry.
I think I'm just gonna go upstairs, if that's okay.
Are you sure, honey?
Your mom made a tamale pie, Ben.
No, thanks.
I mean, I'm not hungry, so...
I don't know.
This is the first time I had someone over since... since we moved here.
So then, are you sure that this is okay?
No, but what are they gonna do, kick you out, kick me out?
Sarah?
I'm kidding.
Come on.
Heavenly Father, thank you for all your blessings, for seeing Ben safely home, for the ad campaign, the revenues from the stores and the health and well-being of our family;
for the capacity to see your vision of the greatness in each of us, and for the grit and perseverance to aspire and make it come true, in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Everyone, this is my friend Heather.
Nice to meet you, Heather.
Sarah, I thought you were working tonight.
Oh, we got off early.
- Grease fire.
- Yeah.
Well...
Heather, won't you please sit down and have some dinner?
Uh, we ate at work already, actually.
So we're just gonna go upstairs and study.
Well, thanks anyway, Mrs. Henrickson.
Everything really smells delicious.
I need a reality check.
Is this a "something" or is this a "nothing"?
She's just being rebellious 'cause she feels too restricted.
I mean, or something.
So what was that all about?
Do they do that all the time?
Nah, just sometimes.
Isn't that kind of homosexual, like when he slapped it around?
Gibson, no way, man!
I just got a vibe thing.
Did it turn you on or something?
'Cause if you're vibin', maybe you're gay, man.
No, it's cool.
Don't get stupid.
But his was bigger than average, right?
It's bigger than yours.
Oh, shut up.
She doesn't even wear makeup and she's so pretty.
My mom looks like a pigeon when she doesn't wear makeup.
She's so not what I expected.
I thought she'd be more like the one with the braid.
- What's her name?
- Nicki.
Yeah.
Sarah, would you and Heather please join us for dessert?
Great.
Thank you.
So, you live off Red Stone Creek?
Yes, near the park.
It's beautiful over there.
My parents don't owe anything on the house.
It used to be my grandparents'.
My mom really wants to move, but my dad won't, and she says that he's really way too attached to his mother.
So, you're Nicki?
What's it like having Roman Grant for a father?
It's an honor.
Well, it was nice to meet you, Heather.
You too, Mr. Henrickson.
And thank you for the spice cake.
I don't usually like it, but the way you made it is delicious.
Not too intense.
You're welcome.
You know, I really have some strong opinions about polygamy, and I would love to sit down and talk to you about it one day.
We should do that sometime.
Okay.
All right.
- I'll see you, Sarah.
- All right.
- Good night.
- Night.
I didn't know she was gonna say that.
I mean, she's just really interested, that's all.
Sarah, if you want to bring a friend home, that's all right.
Just ask first.
You understand?
I understand.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Night, honey.
The window was open in the bathroom, but I shut it.
This is where I stay when I come to town.
Do you want... a sandwich?
Nope.
Where you from?
I'm gonna make a sandwich.
They say these tires cost $49.
By the time you get out of there, it's never $49.
We gonna fuck or what?
What's the matter, man?
What the fuck's the matter with you?
Hey, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up, man!
Shut the fuck up!
You're a crazy fuckin' whacked-out freak!
Honey, stop.
No, you're ovulating.
It's okay.
I was fine.
I was fine.
It's okay.
We're okay.
Let's just go to sleep.
Probably make some friends.
Oh, hey...
I thought you should see this.
- What is it?
- Nicki's credit card.
Oh no, Nicki doesn't have a credit card.
Oh yes, she does.
It was confiscated by the store when she tried to use the family discount.
Why was it confiscated?
Because it's maxed out.
What?
I checked the activity on the card.
Don't ask me how I did it.
I don't want to incriminate myself.
No, I don't want to see it.
Honey, I know you don't want to, but I think you need to.
No, it's Nicki's business.
It's family business.
- A $6,700 credit limit?
- Maxed out.
Even after a payment of 3,000-some-odd dollars.
Nicki doesn't have $3,000 for a payment.
Well, somebody made it for her.
No, not without telling me.
Bill wouldn't do that.
I'm just saying somebody paid it.
This is what happens when a person in a family starts keeping secrets.
Well, we don't have secrets like that.
Really?
Two caesar salads.
Enjoy.
And your name, ma'am?
Nicolette Grant.
The last four digits of your social security number, please?
Um, 5642.
And your mother's maiden name?
Hallstrom.
And how may I help you?
I just wanna know that you've received the payment I sent.
I'm sorry, miss Grant, on which account?
Which account?
Nicki!
Nicki!
Nicki?
What are you doing?
Nicki...
You can't.
You have no right!
- I have every right!
- These are my things!
Are you out of your mind?
You have no right to invade my privacy.
Well, do you have any idea what you're doing to us?
To our family?
When were you gonna say something?
When the creditors just came crawling all over us?
You have a lot of nerve lecturing me about secrets.
No, this is about this.
How many credit cards do you have?
Five.
Tell the truth.
Nine.
How did you get nine cards?
I don't know, they just kept sending them to me.
One after another after another!
How much do you owe?
20,000.
Nicki?
58,000.
$58,000.
Why?
I don't know.
It's compulsive.
I can't help it!
Does Bill know the full amount?
Bill doesn't know anything.
He doesn't know a thing about it.
Well, how can he not know?
He just paid $3,000 on it!
No, he didn't.
My father did.
Oh, good night.
Bill knows nothing?
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
I don't even want to think about what Bill's gonna say when he hears about all this.
We can't tell him!
Barb, please, you can't tell him.
Please.
You know I can't keep this from him.
How can I keep this a secret?
But he'll kick me out.
What are you talking about?
He would never do that.
What if he does?
I'm so scared.
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't.
Oh, Nicki.
Oh, it was beautiful!
The music, the little bit of reading at the end.
Oh, gotta love the scripture.
"Yea." I just love that.
It's so excited, like, "hark, glad tidings."
Pammie drinks a bit too much from the cup of salvation.
- "But woe unto him." - "Woe."
- It's fun, huh?
- Yes.
Lloyd and Sue are having a reception for the musicians at their house.
Want to go?
Okay.
We have got a super ward.
There's potluck and fireside for singles every tuesday.
Singles salsa.
It works.
For us it did.
Really?
Then the society tutors at the reservation, and sunday night scripture studies.
Bet you didn't think you'd find all that here, did you?
I don't know what I thought, what I expected, but--
Gotcha, huh?
Just kidding.
Converted.
Converted.
Seriously, why don't you come back for sacrament meeting tomorrow?
- Okay, so, Del.
- Yes, sir.
Tell me about yourself.
Where were you born?
- I was born here--
- Del, sweetie.
I need you to look right over here at the camera.
Okay.
I was born here, and Beth was born in Ogden.
Uh, neither one of us had any desire to leave.
Uh, I mean, why-why would you?
This is, you know, a perfect place to grow up and to raise your family, and it's-
- It's wonderful.
Yeah, absolutely.
Okay, note.
Cougar.
Says "BYU" without saying "BYU."
No comment.
Um, I'm housewares manager for Home Plus.
Worked a slew of places before.
Yeah, but Home Plus just fit in a lot of little ways.
Maybe it's because they grew up here, too.
See?
Home-grown, home field advantage-local.
Like I told you.
- Um--
- I think-
- I think we--
Okay.
Had to do it.
It's a killer-- the temple.
Obviously not in the first angle.
That would be cheesy, but the temple.
Gotta have the temple.
Do it over here, so you can stretch.
Right there.
Good, you look really pretty.
That looks great.
Okay, you got that?
I just-
- I love this family.
They're just perfect.
Okay, so, Del.
Say "Home Plus is us."
Home Plus is us.
Actually, look right at the camera and say that.
I'm sorry.
Um, Home Plus is us.
Now, say it like you just thought of it.
Home Plus is us.
Good.
All right, again.
- Home Plus is us.
- Good.
One more time.
- Home plu-
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
- Uh, Home Plus is us--
- Home Plus is us.
- Again.
- Again.
Home Plus is us.
Excellent!
That was good!
You gotta love 'em.
It'll be great.
Splice it all together, it'll be perfect.
Uh, family: fun.
Utah: fun, huh?
Fantastic.
It's-- it's super.
Really.
You okay?
It's Nicki.
Is it about switching nights?
'Cause it won't last forever, you know that.
I know.
I love you.
I love you, too.
First new message.
Bill, I-I need to talk to you.
- Get down!
Levelor, get--
- Next message.
- Oh, no.
- Bill.
Will you-
- Heaven, get back.
Don't you dare!
Look out!
Crazy woman's got a gun!
Get away from there!
Get away from me!
Don't you touch me!
All right!
Back off!
Put it down!
Oh, Lola, that's a good girl.
Just right here, Lola.
That's a good girl, Lola.
- Evicted?
- Yeah.
Nice of you to show up.
I came as soon as I heard.
So what happened?
What'd you do to tick off Roman?
Oh no, you don't.
It was you who got us dispossessed by the U.E.B.
And I hope you haven't done anything to jeopardize my position in the community.
What position?
This has nothing to do with me.
Keep trying to convince yourself of that while we sit in here and rot.
We have been thrown out of our lives.
Whatever it is you've been fighting over,
I hope it's worth it.
Hey.
Thanks for coming out here.
Joey, what happened?
They had bulldozers almost on top of our houses.
They were ready to tear them down with us in them if we didn't get out.
They own those houses.
They wouldn't destroy their own property.
They tore down the statue of grandpa at founder's park, Bill.
And they made us watch while they jackhammered it.
I hate to mention this, but you know wanda's due this month, and, you know, I really don't want to have my baby in a motel, Bill.
I will not let that happen.
Here.
What?
Uh, just so you have some cash on you.
Go on.
Go on, take it.
Joey.
Hi, Wanda.
Bill.
Um, Joey, would you get me an orange soda out of the machine?
Sure, babe.
- And something salty.
- Okay.
Wanda, I promise you, you will not have the baby in this motel.
Oh, I could give birth in a potato patch.
I'd survive.
It's Joey I'm worried about.
He'd never say it to you, but he sunk everything into that fish farm, and Roman drained those tanks.
Oh, no.
And we owe the investors who backed us and believed in us, and-- and if, um... if Joey cracks, if he falls apart... or if he falls off the wagon,
I'm holding you responsible.
Oh, Wanda.
I knew it was you.
Mom.
Joey turned the TV up too high, and I can't get the volume back down again.
They gave us five minutes to clear out of there.
They grabbed me.
I fought.
Look.
Look.
- Oh, jeepers.
- Bruises.
Hoo-hoo, I got 'em back good, though.
But what about our houses, our things?
Don't you worry, mother.
We'll straighten this out in a hurry.
Now, sit down.
Just sit down here.
He's just been waitin' for the right time to get rid of us.
Joey told me what he did to the statue.
It won't end there.
Next thing you know, he'll be diggin' up your grandfather's grave.
And then your sister!
I'm sorry, this is about me.
It's about me and Roman and the stores.
No, it isn't.
It's 30 years of harassment.
He's just trying to make like the Henricksons never even existed.
My daddy was the one true prophet, and Roman Grant is gonna burn in "H" for what he's done to us.
When do we turn the corner?
When do we get justice?
Hi.
Did you take the roast out of the freezer?
Thank you, sweetie.
Where have you been?
Oh, I just did some errands that I had to do.
With dad?
What?
- Hi.
- Are they okay?
No.
Hello?
Mr. Henrickson?
Yes?
This is Dan Potts.
Security, down at the store.
Look, I hate to bother you, but...
I was told to always call you before contacting the police.
That's right.
What's wrong?
Well, we apprehended a burglar rooting' around in your office.
He take anything?
Well, I'm not sure, but he sure made a big mess.
Did you get an ID on him?
Yes, sir, we did.
His name's Albert Grant.
Put him on the phone.
Hello?
I would have thought papa would have sent someone more capable.
Certain connections, certain involvements... made known... you know, not good.
Understand?
What are you saying?
I'm just saying.
You want me to call the police, Mr. Henrickson?
No.
No no, it's not necessary.
Then you don't want to press charges?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- He broke in.
- Let him go.
What was that about?
Nothing.
It's taken care of.
It's Roman.
I'm trying to get free.
He says he's entitled to a piece of the second store.
I'm fightingim, he's fightin' me back.
I didn't want you to worry.
I'm gonna get a glass of milk.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Barb, it feels like... everything is spinning out of control.
We can't keep doing what we're doing.
But I need you.
You have me.
And you have a family.
We can't.
No.
You're right.
We can't.
Okay, and what else do you want?
Mmm, this one.
- Want breakfast?
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- No, this is good.
Go take this to Sarah.
Go inside and shut the door.
Okay.
Can you believe it?
It's like a train whistle.
What are they thinking?
Teenie heard everything.
Hi.
Do you have an extra dozen eggs?
Yeah.
Boys, go into Barb's and wait for us there, okay?
Go on.
She wasn't like that in the old house.
She was out in the annex and her windows were double-Paned.
She's so loud.
I mean, loud loud.
This can't go on, Barb.
Not like this.
I've got a boner.
You always got a boner.
Just in the mornings.
Well, it's God's gift to man.
What time is it?
Almost 9:00.
When's for breakfast.
It's a big boner.
I'm hungry.
Let's eat.
You're a big boner.
You're a perv.
Mmm, you're my blue-eyed boy, aren't you?
My little old blue-eyed boy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It's not discreet, invites problems.
Well, I just want you to know I don't think it's right, either.
I'm gonna talk to her.
Nicki, no.
You can't do that.
Yes, I can.
She can't help it, if she's too loud.
Sarah, go make sure the boys have finished their milk.
It's not just that she's loud.
They should be over here by now.
They know we're doing breakfast.
It's disrespectful.
You're right.
Darn right I'm right.
Good morning, Mrs. H., Nicki.
- Good morning, Jason.
- Good morning.
- Ben?
- Yeah?
Go put a shirt on.
This isn't a nudist colony last time I checked.
- Yes, mom.
- And Sarah, no milk cartons on the table.
- Do you want my bacon?
- No, I don't.
It's gross.
Let's set the big table.
Ben, help your sister.
Teenie, go get your father and Margene, and tell them we're making breakfast here this morning.
They should know it.
And call up before you go upstairs, you understand?
Nicki, do you want me to section the grapefruit for the boys?
Yeah, thanks.
That would help.
And another thing-- this is your day.
You have Bill tonight and our nights start at 9:00 a.m.
We have to stand up for ourselves-- no excuses.
Mom, the bacon's burning.
Thank you, honey.
This is your day, Barb.
- Mom, they're coming.
- Thank you.
Come here, you.
What?
- Morning.
- Hi, dad.
Morning.
Ah, food.
Morning.
Morning.
What can I do?
Feed your babies.
Already did.
Here, Ben, I'll take the baby.
Honey, two pieces.
Fine, fine.
His good cholesterol's non-existent and his bad is off the chart.
- Morning, dad.
- Do you have whole curd?
Good morning, Margie.
Morning, Benny.
Give me a hug, I'm cold!
Margie?
Margie.
Margie!
Margie!
Yes?
Can you help me out over here?
Ben, did you hear the Jazz won?
Yeah, double overtime.
- Margie?
- Mm-Hmm.
Yes?
Where did you get that?
I've always had this.
Half-Dressed?
Ben is having a sleepover.
It's just Jason.
And Sarah and Teenie.
Do you want them to think it's all right to run around dressed like that?
Nope.
Guess I wasn't thinking.
Hey, so coach made me third baseman.
Nice.
I don't know how to tell her.
She's acting like a child.
Yes, she is.
Maybe I'll talk to Bill.
Uch, I hate those conversations.
I'll talk to him.
It'll be better coming from me.
Thank you.
You're welcome, Barb.
That's cream cheese, I'm not eating it.
Eagle gas.
Mom?
Who else would it be on a weekend?
How's the pollen where you are?
I just took a benadryl.
Made me goofy.
What's up?
Has Roman spoken to you?
That thief.
About what?
About me.
About a business deal?
A U.E.B. loan?
Bet your father's involved.
Another thief.
He's on the priesthood council--
Den of thieves.
So he hasn't?
No.
Well, has dad mentioned anything?
Uh, I wouldn't know.
- Haven't you spoken to him since--
- No.
Well, don't you think you should?
You wanna talk to him, be my guest.
Have a love-fest.
He gets out of the hospital tomorrow.
Aren't you gonna pick him up?
Me?
Heck, no.
Don't you wanna cover all your bases?
He was poisoned, mom.
- Who do you think he's gonna--
- Wait a minute.
Whoa whoa whoa, now.
What do you think?
It-do-you think it-
- You-you think it was me?
- No, but I--
- It wasn't me.
And I resent you even suggesting that.
I just wanna protect you in case he suspects you.
Well, how could he suspect me when I didn't do anything?
That's crazy.
Fine, fine.
So who is gonna pick him up?
Well, why don't you go pick him up?
I hate him as much as you do.
Then, maybe you did it.
Do you know your brother's starting up a fish farm?
Oh, mom?
So what are you doing over here?
What's gotten into you lately?
I'm here on behalf of Barb.
On behalf of Barb?
I gotta get to the office for a meeting.
Can it wait?
No, it can't.
You've been insensitive.
It's not just that you've cut Barb's day-- night-short.
I mean, we all know that happens, even on the best of schedules, but Bill...
Marge... she screams like a tractor-trailer.
How do you expect Barb to practice any self-control?
Self-control?
Barb is deeply upset...
Deeply jealous.
What about you?
Me?
Yeah.
Are you jealous when Margie goes off like a tractor-trailer?
I fight my jealousies and I conquer them.
Well, I'm sorry.
You can tell Barb that.
Good, I will.
That's a start.
My little blue-eyed girl.
My little blue-eyed girl, aren't you?
Aren't you?
I spoke to him.
What'd he say?
He understands.
What's he going to do about it?
He thinks you should call a meeting and let Margene know she has to stick to the schedule.
The schedule?
Or at least practice some self-control.
Where's Wayne and Raymond?
Nicki?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh, do you need something?
Where's Barb?
She had a lunch.
Brunch.
I need your car.
When?
Now.
I don't think it's such a good idea, honey.
The engine started doing this ka-thunk, ka-thunk noise.
Thank goodness, it's still under warranty.
I need a car, Nicki.
Barb asked me to shop for her tonight and I have this whole list of stuff and now I'm stuck.
And I'm sure you'll work it out.
Maybe you could call a cab.
It's funny.
I thought we shared everything.
Hey.
Thanks for coming in, Ronnie.
Oh, only thing at home is saturday's a wonderful day.
It's the day you get ready for Sabbath tomorrow.
So, how did those store cams do for you?
Everything I promised, right?
Couldn't be happier.
This is about something other than store security, though.
Well, total confidentiality, always.
I had an investor a few years back, made a loan.
I've repaid the loan several times over, but still they want more.
It's extortion.
I'm no longer paying and I expect some sort of retribution.
We can do bodyguards.
We can do round-the-clock surveillance.
If there's a risk of car bombings, anything--
No no no, I'm interested in protecting my family and my home, is all.
We'll send someone out to the house, come up with a good system.
Wanna tell me the guy's name?
Roman Grant.
Heard of Juniper Creek?
Polygamy.
You know, Bill, have you considered going to the police with this?
These are tough customers.
I appreciate that, but I'd just as soon keep it quiet.
I'd just as soon they not know.
Okay.
Ronnie...
There's one more thing.
My house is three houses.
What?
Rentals?
No, I live in all three houses.
In all three?
With my family.
They're connected.
All three houses?
That's right.
Big family.
I see.
I see.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll, uh-- we'll take care of it.
I want my family protected, Ronnie, and I want the best.
Income from Tithing.
Last month's income from the Sunny K.
Yes.
Income from Intermountain Vending Machine Co.
Yes.
- Bee Hive Tool and Die.
- Yes.
- Copper Mine and Smelter.
- Yes.
Great Basin Coal Mine.
Wha-what's the footnote?
We're reckoning the 150,000 set aside for the NLRB for the miner's strike fund.
No, claim it as an ordinary business expense and take it as a deduction instead.
Okay.
Henrickson Home Plus.
Yes.
Here on out, endorse any payments that come in
"Accepted under protest" and put them in escrow.
Keep our hands clean on it for now, till Papa decides how he wishes to proceed.
What are you doing in town?
Cancer Society, working on next month's survivors' walk.
Can I come in?
I try to be supportive of his ad, but he looks so silly in that cowboy hat.
Just move that stuff.
I brought home all the applications for the new bookkeeping position.
Hate that part of the job-- always suspecting people, but one poison pill can bring the whole roof crashing down.
This junk is gonna kill me.
Jason and Ben had a nice sleepover.
Where are Vernie and Jojo?
They live at the mall these days.
Those two-- bugs me.
Sometimes I really do think I'm gonna blow my brains out.
Nicki or Margie?
Margie.
Nicki's a trial, but it's Margie.
She is so uninhibited.
I was never that uninhibited, that immodest.
You would not believe the robe she wore to breakfast.
I am telling you, the hem only came up to here.
Can't you talk to her about it?
No.
How?
I got her to donate a big pile of them to the Red Cross last year after the tsunami, but she seems to have an endless supply.
It's not funny.
I've been driving around for like an hour and a half.
It's like...
I've been married to Bill 17 years, and I adore the comfort.
I love my mature marriage.
"Mature marriage." Oh, honey.
I've been married to Don 27 years.
And when he goes into the bathroom and shaves at night, it's uh-oh time, better click on the TV, try to distract him with a movie.
That's mature marriage.
You just-- you don't have to struggle with it the way I do.
Oh, no?
Don is a very sensuous man.
And I have to work with him too.
How do you think it feels to watch him walk the floor of Home Plus all day?
He flirts.
Since when?
He denies it, but it's true.
I keep telling you the antidepressants really do take the edge off.
Barb, they are not addictive.
What are you doing over here?
I fell asleep.
Where's Aaron and Lester?
You shouldn't be over here napping.
You've got your own house now.
I don't like it at my house.
You could fix it up.
I got you those stools.
I like it here.
Everyone's always here.
It's better than living on top of each other like we were before, isn't it?
I guess.
I need a car.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Can I have a car?
Margie, three houses, four cars?
I mean, look at these bills-- pediatrician, roofer, Utah electric.
I saw you with Nicki.
W hat?
In our house, in my bedroom--
In my bedroom-
- I saw you and it was my morning.
It wasn't your morning.
But it was my bedroom, and you used my words.
You used my words in our bedroom.
Margie.
I don't mind sharing you, I like sharing you,
I like us all together, but you can't use my words in our bed.
That's sacred.
Honey, hey.
I love you and I respect you.
Ultimately, you've gotta learn to trust me.
Well, what you did was mean.
Well, I'm truly sorry if you got your feelings hurt.
No.
You did something bad, you and Nicki, and you hurt my feelings.
Margie.
Well, you did.
Fine.
Fine.
- Bill.
- Barb, not now.
Well, Nicki wouldn't let me use her car.
And you had yours, and so the shopping did not get done.
Well, okay.
Come on.
Going home.
Yep, come on.
Your health is returning.
It's the blessing we've prayed for.
Now, Harleen sent this along for you.
Now, your lips are parched.
A nice, slow sip.
That's good.
More-- take more.
Now, that's good.
Children-- how they make us proud and how they disappoint.
Now, let's talk about Bill, Frank.
How are things between the two of you these days?
They're good.
No... bad blood?
Bill and me?
Like that.
Good.
Glad to hear that.
However, I have a message for you to give him.
Tell him to shape up.
Tell him to get back in line.
And tell him he will not be welcome back on Compound Property until he does.
Will you tell him that for me?
I certainly will, Roman.
And brother Roman, thank you so much.
You bet.
God bless you.
I sure pray for you, continually.
I surely do.
And I for you.
Thank you.
Goodbye for now.
Bye.
Oh, there it is, honey.
You know, I really like this one.
I like that one.
Needs paint.
- We made it.
- Hi.
Hey, come in.
This is the right place.
Drive on!
- Hey.
Hello, darling.
- Come on in now.
Take that jacket off.
- Margene, get those coats.
- Okay.
Jojo, the butter's on the stove and the oven's preheated to 350.
My goodness.
There's pretzels in here.
Could you get me those napkins, Margie?
Barb, what can I do to help?
Um, just a minute.
Nicki?
Can you run those out?
Sure.
Marge?
- They go from room to room...
- Thanks.
...a supplier in each room, and they tell the supplier what they're willing to pay, take it or leave it.
You see these suppliers buckling and bowing and scraping.
- Can you imagine?
- No.
To be a Wal-Mart?
If I had three wishes, it'd be to be Wal-Mart, to be Wal-Mart and to be Wal-Mart.
Don?
Thank you, Margene.
It's exciting, taking them on.
Mano a mano with Wal-Mart.
Can do it.
We can beat 'em.
We can beat 'em here in Utah.
Maybe Idaho, Arizona-
- Thanks, honey.
But Utah?
Definitely.
What color do you call that dress?
Oh, it's...
Just blue, I guess.
That's pale blue I'd say, Margie.
I think they call it aqua...
Or, um, no, uh, turquoise.
I don't know.
Well, it suits you.
It does.
- I mean, here in Utah--
- It'd be a nice color for a car.
Well, I'm not so sure about that.
What do you think, Don?
You think it'd make a good color for a car?
Not a good color for a car, right?
No, I don't think for a car, Marge.
Sorry.
Not for a car.
I just think the war is wrong.
And I don't care for this administration's foreign policy.
9/11, Barb.
They attacked us first.
And all I know is I've got two boys over there.
What?
You're not a democrat, are you, Barb?
The war is still going on when Ben and Jason are 18.
- Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Make mine without cheese, please.
Right now, we just have to support our troops.
What's going on with Margie?
Nothing.
- Car bombing?
- No, no.
He-he said it as a for-instance.
But they're coming here to the houses?
Sending out his team.
But gosh, Bill.
They're coming here to do the houses?
They're gonna know.
Ronnie's discreet-
- Partner with the secret service when air force one's in town.
Look, I'm gonna run down there tomorrow and get a sense where things stand with Roman.
Hey, Nick.
We about ready?
Give me and Don a sec.
Talk business.
Look.
I'll know more tomorrow.
I'm seeing someone.
No?
Is it serious?
Peg knows.
I haven't told Verna and Jojo.
I wanted to make sure before I get everyone's hopes up.
But we talked about it a month ago and all agreed it was time to add another wife to the family.
Uh, she's a member of our congregation.
You know, if you ever wanted to come and--
You guys aren't Juniper Creek, but I'm just not ready to go back to an organized group.
Barb would have a fit.
She still misses LDS.
So, how long you been seeing this, uh--
- Betty?
- Betty...
Couple months.
You put any thought into a fourth?
I don't think it's in the cards for us.
Not right now.
Just handling these three-
- It's a full-time job.
Sometimes I wake up at 4:00 a.m. just thinking about all the responsibilities.
You chose some toughies.
You always gotta keep reminding 'em of the big picture.
It's not easy staying on top of 'em, anticipating their needs.
But they're the path you've chosen.
You gotta pray for guidance and walk it with decency.
- Stop.
- What?
It tickle?
No.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, what?
Hurt?
Hurt?
Hurt now?
Ow!
Did you have a girlfriend at your old high school?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
Guys, come on, okay?
Dealt-one heart.
One spade.
How was Jason?
He is such a gentleman.
Is he still involved in scouting?
Marge?
Your bid.
He's fascinated with emergency preparedness.
He designed the evacuation plan for our house and had us all run drills.
What badge is that?
Star.
Thank you, partner.
He organized a first-aid station at jamboree last summer-- last july, in Virginia.
Most of his troop is LDS.
He'll learn what it means to be a saint.
Nothing wrong with that.
Long as they don't put the bishop on you.
Last thing you wanna do is call attention.
I don't know what to do.
If you have six to eight points, one no.
Eight to ten with a four card suit and honors, you can raise to two in that suit.
Give it.
I know you got it.
Oh-ho.
I'll never tell.
Table talk, people.
Marge, if you don't bid I'm going to scream.
Um, three clubs?
Wow, that's very good, Margie.
Pass.
Three no.
- Pass.
- Pass.
- Double.
- Redouble.
That makes you the dummy again, Marge.
Lay 'em down.
What are you doing?
You've got nothing.
You can't jump shift with just four points.
You indicated 16, Margie.
It's just a game, people.
What have you done to me?
What do you think of Brynn?
You're so out of control, is what I think.
You need to slow down.
And look, she's a senior.
We're sophomores.
She wants your manhood.
She's after your bone, man.
I think you need some serious guidance.
CTR, man-- "Choose the right."
Where'd Nicki run off to?
Ooh, I don't know.
Putting the boys down, I guess.
I should go make sure that Sarah's holding up.
- Barb?
- Hmm?
Can you ask Bill if I can have a car?
I mean, I have a lot of errands and it's not the first time I've been strand and had to take that yellow van.
I'll talk to him about it.
Oh, thank you so much, Barb.
- So.
- Hmm?
What's going on between you and Nicki?
Nothing.
Margie?
If something is wrong with you, it's wrong with all of us.
Now, if you wanna talk, I'd be happy to--
You need to talk to Ben.
About what?
About responsibility.
Oh, you mean sex.
I've had sex talks with him.
Well, again then.
His new girlfriend is apparently no saint in any sense of the word.
She's kind of fast.
How fast?
This fast?
I hope not.
And I'm serious.
Don't worry.
I'll give him the deluxe talk.
The "save yourself but oral is moral" talk.
That was the '80s, Bill.
Worked wonders on you, remember?
"Oral is moral, baby."
I was waiting for our night.
- You were?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna prove how much.
Where are you going?
I gotta get moving.
I'm going to pick up my dad and take him back to the Compound.
Oh, why on earth would you do that?
I told my mom I'd do it.
She called and I said I would.
She's got the flu.
I really enjoyed last night.
Come here.
I gotta go, Barb.
I'm late.
Oh, come on, baby.
Oral is moral.
You have to wear your shin guards, okay?
Don't forget.
Even though they're uncomfortable, I know, you'll be better off in the end, okay?
Okay.
- Bill?
- Dad?
Bill?
Dad?
Come on, boys.
Mother?
Wayne, take Raymond into the kitchen and watch TV, okay?
Okay, mom.
Come on, Raymond.
You're late.
What do you mean?
Today is my night.
Well, I'm aware of that, Nicki.
No, it's 9:45, the day of my night and I told the boys that you would take them to soccer camp.
Well, I thought we had to enroll them.
We did enroll them and now they're going.
I gotta take a rain check.
I have some business.
Bill, you promised.
And it's not just me, although you did say you'd come over and look at my electrical system.
I rewired from the circuit breaker to the meter and it still keeps blowing fuses.
I told you, I'm taking care of all the electrical.
Marge's toilets clogged.
My toilet's fine.
I plunged it.
I'm gonna pick up my father and take him back to the compound.
- I'll come with you.
- I need to do this, just me.
Okay, fine.
- Nicki!
- Boys.
Time to go, come on!
I want to watch the movie.
Honey, don't let them upset you.
I said now!
Good morning, Margie.
Morning.
Nicki, good morning.
Morning.
Hypocrite.
What I love about the church is how they urge you to go out into the community and volunteer.
I volunteered at open door for six months.
That's where gay, lesbian and transgender homeless teens can find help.
You should come with me.
Are these with or without?
Without.
You know, it's a really important organization.
And they're so unpredictable.
You never know what they're gonna say.
It's really funny.
Thank you very much.
What exactly is "transgendered" exactly?
It's when, uh...
I don't know.
A lot of people might think that I'm too mormon, too snooty to volunteer there, but I not.
I'm very tolerant, I'm very open-minded and I'm totally understanding.
Dad.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to take you home.
- I don't need your help.
- Tough, get dressed.
- I got wives coming for me.
- Call 'em and tell them not to.
Well, they just brought me my lunch.
Then eat it.
- Are you closing tonight?
- No.
My aunt's coming to visit.
She used to be real close, then she left the church and moved to California and caused a big rift at first, but she's still welcome in our house.
You know what?
Even when we don't approve of others' actions,
I think that love is still unconditional.
You are so determined.
What?
You overheard something last week.
We both know it.
You've been fishing ever since, sending signals, one after the other.
Look, I'm a polygamist.
My parents are.
So what?
I was just trying to let you know that I knew.
I didn't want to be rude.
Well, now it's official.
So what are you gonna do, rat me out to your state trooper father?
Probably!
You know, 'cause I tell him everything.
Why does everyone think I don't have a sense of humor?
Look.
I don't care what your parents do.
I just wanna be friends, okay?
We need a fishwich.
Okay.
I should tell you, I don't agree with, uh-- polygamy.
Yeah, well, guess what?
Neither do I.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Hello.
Fishwich.
Dig your own grave.
So it's not the milk of human kindness that brung you down here.
Nope.
Just wanted to make sure I wasn't dead, didn't you?
Not really.
You know something?
I always knew... you'd be the success.
Something about the old dark horse.
That was you.
Football and Joey-- loser, flash in the pan-- but not you.
Money, business--
Now we're talking.
You still on the priesthood council?
- Oh, yeah.
- Talked to Roman?
Now, you got something going with Roman?
Nothing I don't have under control.
Well, that's good.
But if it wasn't quite as under control as you say,
I could be a help maybe.
I could be useful.
You know, Roman and I have a long relationship.
Goes back a long way, you know what I mean?
He tells me everything.
Wouldn't cost you much.
I don't know-- 5,000.
You trying to shake me down?
You old fool, I came out here 'cause you almost died, 'cause your old buddy Roman tried to do you in.
Thought it was my responsibility to warn you.
- Roman?
Please.
- Come on, hurry up.
So we both think that your mother did it.
What?
Oh, come on.
You feel the same way I do.
She has me come over there to fix her chainsaw, lures me into the rat trap she has the guts to call a house, feeds me that soup.
You saw me a week later.
I was lucky to get out of there alive.
You know something?
You ought to thank me for your successes, because if I hadn't have pushed you out there in--
- Pushed me out?
- Yeah.
You threw me out like I was garbage!
Had me get in the back of the pick-up, drove me into the city, told me to get out.
Yeah.
Fend for myself?
I was 14 years old.
What do you think I did?
What do you think I had to do?
If you think I'd ever thank you for anything but shame and heartache--
What are you waiting for, an apology?
That's the way it is.
Young boys get run off.
Old men get all the pretty girls.
That's the way it is, bud.
You lacked the decency to even give me your name.
- Oh, please.
- Oh, what am I doing?
!
The sooner you're out of my hair, the better!
- I'm not getting in that.
- Get in.
I'm not get-
- Oh, come on.
That's my dessert.
Let's go.
You hungry?
I'll take you to mom.
I am hungry.
- She'll feed you some of her soup.
- I'm not going to her house.
- Let's get some soup.
I-
- Come on, I control her.
- You don't control anybody.
- Oh, I do too.
- You don't control her.
- Oh, watch me.
- You don't control anybody!
- Oh, really?
You watch-
- You watch your back.
- You better watch your back.
- Watch your back.
We're never too far apart when we're holding hands.
All right.
Bill is sitting down with the seller's agent tomorrow.
He's gonna present our final list of all undisclosed problems.
Hopefully, there'll be an adjustment without a lawsuit.
I need your lists.
Oh, darn.
What's eating you?
You know.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
You slept with Bill in my bed.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did, Nicki.
I saw you.
Shh, lower your voice.
If Barb hears you talking, it'll upset her.
- It's wrong, what you did.
- Shh, would you stop?
I want you to admit it.
Admit it.
All right.
Where were we?
You wanted a list of problems with each house.
Right, Marge?
See, and I don't like it when you talk to me like that, either.
Like what?
Never mind.
You know, I have something I wanna say.
I wanna say that we have a schedule, and we have the schedule because we need the schedule.
Um, what do you want us to know by saying that, Margie?
That Nicki slept with Bill in my bed-- yesterday.
Nicki, is that true?
I don't know what she's talking about.
Oh, yes, you do and you know it!
Well, I'm sorry, okay?
It just happened!
And you wanna know the truth?
It all started because you are so darn loud.
That is so not true!
Actually, Margie, it is true, but, Nicki, what were you thinking?
Well, it's not like you're so innocent in all this, boss lady.
And I said I was sorry, okay?
I don't see why we have to keep harping on it.
I'm done talking about it.
We're here to talk about home repairs, and I brought my list.
You got Alby after you, you got Roman after you.
I think I'll, uh... hoof it on home from here.
You gather my meaning.
Thanks for the lift.
Say hello to your dad.
Heavenly father, thank you for the clear roads driving home,
but I'm lost.
Guide me.
Guide me back to the path of your righteousness.
You are my father.
Show me the way, father.
Show me the way.
In the name of Jesus Christ, help me.
Amen.
Bill?
Honey?
I've been thinking about you.
We are links to eternity.
Ahead of us, family yet to come, souls to be born.
Behind us, ancestors-- ancestors who sacrificed.
We are making those sacrifices to live the principle, to keep faith.
Margie, you are a valued member of this family.
We weren't complete, not until you.
You made us complete.
I wasn't complete until you and our fine sons.
What happened was a mistake.
It'll never happen again, all right?
All right?
I gotta get.
But I still need a car.
Hey, mom.
What on earth did you do to him?
What did I do?
I picked him up at the hospital, is all.
What did you say?
To tell you the truth, mom, it's been a long day.
I can't remember what I said.
- I tried to tell him that--
- It was me who poisoned him?
- No.
- Well, that's what he told me.
He told me you said I did it.
- Ma, I said no-
- I did no such thing.
- Told him to watch his back around me.
"Watch your back."
What have you done?
He says he's gonna kill me.
- That is what he said.
- Mom, mom, mom, mom, calm down.
Me calm down?
Yeah, we'll work this out.
- Easy for you to say, traitor.
- Mom!
Bill?
Bill, come to bed.
Bill?
I'm coming.
We shook hands, we went our separate ways, and that is all she wrote!
Look at you.
Look how happy you are.
A huge weight is gone!
So... we are celebrating.
I've invited Don and family to a Barbecue -- a sort of... engagement party for Betty.
I've ordered lobsters.
I'll dig a fire pit in the backyard.
Lobsters?
For everyone?
I mean, that's a lot of lobster.
Well, it's a big day for Don and for us.
There's no sin in a rare extravagance.
"Christian story time."
- There's daddy.
- Daddy!
How are ya, baby?
Let's see what we got.
Oh, what's daddy have for Raymond?
Don't be sad.
Daddy's being very generous.
Okay, then.
Give me the 10 and I'll get you some pennies.
Come on, Ray!
It's the Jesus show!
So what's the occasion, daddy?
Business is-- ow looking up.
When I was living on the streets, I used to dream of having just one thing of my own, just one thing to be proud of that was mine.
And now I have three beautiful wives, seven perfect children, and I'm about to add a third store to this family-- free and clear.
Our third store... free and clear.
Here it comes.
Here it comes.
Here it comes.
Oh!
Ooh, I like it when you're in control.
- I love you, Bill.
- I love you too.
How much?
Oh, I'd say it's... astronomical.
Beyond all measure.
I'm $58,000 in debt.
I was waiting for the right time to tell you.
Right time?
Well, who-- well, who do you owe?
American express.
How did you get a credit card?
I don't remember.
I filled out a form and they sent me one.
With a $60,000 limit?
!
I have a few cards.
How many?
Nine.
What?
!
I mean, how did you--
Oh, Nicki, how could you?
!
- Bill.
- Jeez!
Where are you going?
- Please talk to me.
- Go back inside.
Someone might see you.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
- Bill.
- Nicki.
I overslept.
What do you know about Nicki's finances?
She gets her $850-a-month allowance like the rest of us.
I'm talking about excessive shopping.
Well, she's been doing most of the shopping since I started work.
I can step back in if you want.
She's in debt up to her eyeballs!
What are you talking about?
She owes almost 60 grand!
Okay, all right.
Just calm down.
Calm down?
I can't imagine a bigger transgression.
I mean, she's pulled some boners, but this-- this is just-- oh.
Well, I think that there's a way to refinance.
We consolidate onto one or two cards, and we'll just cut up the rest.
You knew, didn't you?
- How long have you known about it?
- Not long.
Nicki.
Morning, Barb.
Have you seen Bill?
Unfortunately, yes.
I mean, Nicki, what have you gone and done?
Nothing.
Bill and me, we had a misunderstanding last night is all.
A misunderstanding?
I didn't tell him you knew anything about it.
Well, I did.
He grilled me and I implicated myself.
I think the least you could have done was give me some warning.
I'm sorry, I just-
- I couldn't take it anymore, and last night he was in such a good mood, it just popped out.
Hi.
What popped out?
Nothing.
- Everything okay?
- We're taking care of it, Margene.
- Taking care of what?
- Margene.
Bill, please, I need to talk to you.
I have nothing to say to you.
And I want to see all of your credit card statements.
Okay, please tell me-- what credit card statements?
Margie, go.
Your babies are eating bugs.
Trade nights with me.
I need tonight to straighten this out with him.
I'm afraid this is going to take more than one night.
Oh, this is just a little glitch is all.
Turns out everyone in the compound is in debt.
I mean, bankruptcies right and left.
It's very common nowadays.
How come I'm always the last one to know what's going on?
Margie, it's personal.
It's no big deal.
Everything's under control.
I wouldn't have told Barb anything either, but she's a snoop.
Hi, everyone.
We're all so excited about sunday.
Thank you for hosting our engagement party with Betty.
I was hoping that while I was here I could practice a song I'm working on.
It's a surprise.
Oh-ho-ho.
Well, of course.
Why don't you sit out by the pool and enjoy the fresh air?
Thank you.
You're gonna love Betty, by the way.
She's got this, I don't know-- this aura about her.
It's very calm and peaceful.
We fell in love with her right away.
The vote was unanimous.
What vote?
I assume she means the vote to allow a new wife into the family.
Was there a vote on me?
We're not talking about that now.
Barb, I need your help.
Wait.
There was a vote on me?
Barb, please switch with me.
Yes, there was a vote.
It was a major decision.
No one ever told me.
I'll switch.
I'll trade.
Tell him we're switching and put in a good word for me.
I can't believe there was a vote.
What, you thought you just coasted in by charming the slacks off Bill?
Some of us had different criteria.
We had to hash it over.
That's the way it works, Margie.
But-- whoa!
You already knew me.
So what, did you, like, sit around and try and dig up flaws?
Stop.
It's the way it's done.
So the whole time we were hanging out, I was being judged?
What did you say about me?
Margie, please.
I need to think.
And you're in the family, aren't you?
So it couldn't have been all that bad.
So there was some bad?
What was it?
Margie, I said I can't talk right now.
Bill's really mad at you, huh?
Margie, we're having a long overdue ironing out of a few little things.
Everything's all for the better.
It's all positive.
Margene!
How's the sound from where you are?
100,000 square feet on two levels with an adjacent parking structure.
And a snack area. full-on food court, not one of those little hot-dog stands out front.
Sounds like one heck of a store.
So the bank will buy and then we do a long-term leaseback.
That's the plan.
Has Utah One been in sales leasebacks long?
Oh, we steered clear of that bubble in the '90s, but we do a fair amount now.
Well, we sure appreciate you coming out here.
With all the bankruptcies nowadays, these site visits are becoming standard procedure.
You know, we just have to see what we're getting ourselves into, you know, should your lights ever go out.
You don't have to worry about that.
Ours are shining pretty bright.
Right, Bill?
Yeah, right.
We've got our finances well under control.
Well, that's good to hear.
At the end of the day, still, it's all about trust, isn't it?
Say, I can recommend a great architectural team.
Already hired one.
- A building contractor?
- We're good.
An environmental or a structural engineer?
Don?
Well, how about a restaurant for lunch?
- You're on.
- Congratulations.
That's great.
All right, you are an ENTJ.
You are an extrovert who relies on judgment over perception, and it says here that you would be good at law, management or operations research.
Hmm.
I've been thinking about becoming a state representative or something in politics, 'cause I'm so tired of people having the wrong idea of Utah.
We're a red state, but that doesn't mean we're neanderthal and not progressive.
Hmm.
Coming from the girl who scored highest on the judgmental part.
Okay, true or false?
You prefer going out with small groups rather than large ones?
Duh.
That's easy.
I can guess.
You're an introvert.
I'm so not an introvert.
Yes, you are.
You would have to be to survive your nutty lifestyle.
But that's my parents.
It's not me.
Yeah, but, I mean, it has to have an effect on you, on your personality.
How could it not?
True or false?
You're comfortable letting others make decisions for you.
No, false.
Hi, can--
Can I talk to you?
I was wondering if you knew anything about a vote about me joining the family.
Uh, that was a few years ago.
I don't really remember.
You don't remember anything?
I'm probably the wrong person to ask.
Benny!
Do you remember a few years ago, a vote about me?
Mmm, which one?
The one about me joining the family.
Which one?
What do you mean, "which one"?
Um, I think there were a few.
I mean, it took a while.
It kept coming in at two to one.
But it was just so everyone could get to know you better.
So--
So they didn't like me right away?
Well, I did.
Bill, one of our... special customers wants to meet you.
Oh.
Hi, I'm Bill Henrickson.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Hello.
Bill, it's Betty.
Betty.
Betty!
Oh, well, nice to meet you.
- Really really nice to meet you.
- Oh, same here.
I feel like I already know you from everything Don told me and from the TV commercials.
So much has been happening to me lately, and this is just... terribly exciting.
Well, um, I guess I'll see you sunday.
Okay.
Um, well, bye-bye till then.
Bye-bye.
Don!
You've got to take it easy.
You can't do that here.
I'm sorry, but isn't she great?
I never thought I'd fall so hard for number four.
Well, hopefully, you can restrain yourself while she's downstairs shopping.
Oh, don't worry.
Down there, Betty's just another shopper.
Listen, Peg just ran the numbers.
Take a look at the total.
By selling the first two stores to the bank and leasing them back, we can get a cash influx of almost $5 million net and a rate of return of 25 to 30%.
Five million.
That's more than enough to pump into the third store and pay down some of our debt.
That's right.
I'm tired of living on credit.
Say, do your wives have any credit cards?
No way.
Those things are a trap.
The interest rate's ridiculous.
- Hello?
- Hi.
You find everything?
Yeah, I just finished.
Well, we need to track down a pot, a lobster pot.
- What kind of pot?
- Lobster.
For lobsters.
Well, where on earth am I supposed to find one of those?
Wal-Mart, K-Mart.
Nicki, if you can't do it, that's fine.
No, I can do it.
I'm happy to.
Is there anything else?
No, that's it.
Thanks.
- Have you spoken to Bill yet?
- Not yet.
I will, though.
Okay.
- Yes.
- Hi.
Just wanted to let you know I'm making pork chops tonight, so don't snack on your way home.
Bill?
We can talk about our little "whoops" after dinner.
I can't see you tonight, Nicki.
In fact, I don't think I can see you for a day or two.
I'm sorry.
Boys, we have to go out again.
Barb wants us to pick something up for her, like usual.
Can we get some ice cream?
No, we can't buy anything fun anymore.
Dad said so.
Won't you talk about it?
What's to talk about?
Look at this!
Williams-Sonoma, Madeline's House of Shoes, the Chocolate Factory?
Who pays for candy with a credit card?
I mean, this is unbelievable!
Why in the "H" did she need all this stuff anyway?
I mean, is it a mental illness or a disease?
A lot of people have this problem, Bill.
And a lot of people are dope fiends, but I'm not married to them.
- Can I help you, officer?
- Bill Henrickson?
I'm Chuck Tuttle.
I'm Heather's father, here to pick her up.
Hello.
I'm Barbara Henrickson, Sarah's mother.
- Uh, please, come in.
- Oh, thanks.
Thank you.
Sarah!
Heather!
Come on down here!
We've become awfully fond of Sarah.
She's been to our house a number of times now.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Likewise.
Sorry you couldn't make it to the father-daughter pancake breakfast.
Yeah.
Dad, I thought mom was picking me up.
Mom was busy with the relief society, honey bun.
Well, nice to finally meet you, Chuck.
You too, Bill.
- Goodbye, Heather.
- Bye.
Sarah, did you know that girl's father was a state trooper?
Yes.
Are we going to jail?
No, honey.
Everything's fine.
Well, how come I didn't know?
There's an awful lot I seem to be in the dark about lately, and I don't like it.
Dad, if you think that Heather's gonna say anything, you're wrong.
She's my friend.
And what's this about a pancake breakfast, anyway?
How come I had to find out about it from a stranger?
Well, it was last weekend, and you work on saturday, so I figured you'd be too busy.
Here's the pot.
I hope it's the right size.
It weighs a ton.
Did you see him?
Did you talk to him?
There you are.
Honey, we do need to talk.
Barb switched nights with me.
Well, switch it back, Barb.
I don't like people making plans for me behind my back.
And I don't like secrets.
Did you see that?
!
He wouldn't even look at me.
- He hates me now.
- Well, he doesn't hate you.
I don't even exist.
I'm gonna sell my car.
No, you're not gonna sell your car.
Just put the pot down.
I am.
And pay down my debt.
It's my car.
Actually, it's not.
Your car belongs to all of us.
My name is on the registration.
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh, you have no idea how glad I am that you called.
I really needed to get out.
Hey, here comes our fourth.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi, Carl.
Hi, Pam.
How are you doing?
Margene, this is chad.
He works with me downtown.
Sorry I'm late.
It's nice to meet you, Margene.
You live across the street from Carl and Pam?
I moved in a few months ago.
Well, isn't that fortuitous?
I've heard a lot about you.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Would you mind putting this on two checks-- the two of us on one and these two on another?
You got it.
And I will have the rib eye, medium rare.
- My wife will be having...
- The chef's salad.
And for you, sir?
I'd like the chicken special and the young lady would like...
Cheeseburger and onion rings, please, and a diet sprite.
- Okay.
Any other beverages?
- Couple of milks.
- Oh, do you have 2%?
- Yes.
- Same, please.
- Okay, great.
You two with the dinner specials are welcome to go to the salad bar.
- All right.
Thanks.
- Excuse us.
- What do you think?
- Is this a date?
Carl and I just thought it would be nice for you meet someone from our church.
But I can't.
I'm not available... emotionally.
Oh, honey, I know how hard it is losing a loved one, but at some point you just have to move on.
I'm not good at meeting people.
I've been told I make a bad first impression.
I liked you right away, and I can tell Chad does too.
Stop being so insecure.
Try and have fun.
I have some thoughts on how we might consolidate this.
...pictures from this afternoon.
The truckee river jumped its banks, flooding downtown Reno.
This fast-moving cold front will sweep across Eastern Nevada...
Let me ask you this-- do you think you'll have patched things up with Nicki by sunday?
I really couldn't tell you, Barb.
I think we should think about canceling the barbecue.
There's too much tension in the houses, Bill.
It's not healthy.
No, we're celebrating.
So you said.
I've ordered the lobsters.
They're being flown in from Maine.
I wish you could slow things down a bit, go slower on the third store, even.
Oh, you are tense as I don't know what.
Now, I worry sometimes about the price we're all paying for success.
Barb, if I didn't keep constantly moving the ball forward, we would sink under our bills.
Yeah, no thanks to Nicki, right?
But, I mean, you can't avoid her forever.
- She's really upset.
- Well, I'm upset too.
You let things get totally out of control around here.
That's not fair.
I mean, you're being unreasonable.
You have to calm down.
Why should I calm down when I find out one of my wives has sunk us 60 thou in debt, which is kept a secret from me for years;
when another wife's kept a secret from me and didn't even tell me what she knew?
I was in a difficult position, Bill, and I'm extremely relieved to be out of it.
I don't like lies either.
If I did, we'd still be meeting in hotels.
And I felt that it was Nicki's place to tell you, not mine.
I'm your husband, aren't I?
Yes, but I'm married to two other people.
You seem to forget that sometimes.
I got another.
A bishop gets into an elevator with a beautiful woman.
The woman hits the stop button, turns to the bishop and says,
"can you make me feel like a true woman?"
And the bishop says, "I sure can," takes off all his clothes, throws them in the corner and says, "now fold them."
That's-- yes.
Okay, Chad, here's one for you.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
None.
It's not the lightbulb that needs changing.
Ho-ho.
Touché, Margene.
Gee, you've got a great sense of humor.
Really?
You think so?
Yeah.
You're quick-witted.
And smart and clever.
Thanks.
I know somebody voted against me, and I want to know why.
- Do you hear me?
- Huh?
I just-
- I don't understand what took you so long to make a decision.
I liked you right away.
And I'll have you know, a lot of people take an instant liking to me.
I'm good at telling jokes.
It took me a while to realize this, but it's true.
Margie, it isn't always about you.
Don't you realize what I'm going through?
I have a lot more on my mind than how many times
I wrote your name down on a piece of paper.
I am one step away from being tossed out onto skid row.
Bill's that mad at you?
Of course not.
It's just a figure of speech.
You know, Nicki, if I were in your shoes,
I'm not sure I'd think I could afford to go out of my way to be mean and alienate someone right now.
Honey, you know how much I care for you.
I love you, Margie.
Do you honestly think I could have voted against you?
Do you really think that's possible?
Look, there's your food court...
- ...and a bigger office.
- Yes, sir.
What are you gonna do when Betty moves in?
Vernie and Jojo are gonna share a room till we can add on.
Good.
Don't spread 'em out into separate houses.
All right, Bill, what's going on?
It's Nicki.
I found out she has a shopping addiction.
She's been hiding it.
I feel like a stranger in my own homes.
Sorry, Bill.
You know, the best thing you can do is get it off your chest with her and move on.
The thing is, I'm having a hard time forgiving her.
I just feel it's-- it's not in me.
My emotions are out of control.
Listen to that.
It's really coming down.
Yeah, I watched it on the weather channel last night.
It was over Nevada.
Whoa.
That was right on top of us.
I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by.
These are for you.
Could I come in for a minute?
I knew you had kids.
I just didn't realize you had so many.
It's a handful sometimes.
I love kids.
And I'm pretty good with them, too.
I had such a great time at dinner.
You are so fun to be around.
Really?
That's nice to hear.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
I was thinking about meeting you.
I know this sounds crazy, but I felt this kind of a--
I don't know, like a burning in my bosom.
All night my mind was racing.
I believe I might have had a revelation-- you're the one for me.
I don't know... what to say.
I'm going to kiss you now.
Chad, uh...
I need to tell you I have my eye on someone else.
Forgive me for saying this... but perhaps you're looking in the wrong direction.
I can't believe it just collapsed.
I'll go call the insurance company and I should get some cones to block of the area.
The last thing we need is a lawsuit.
You seem to have suffered some misfortune.
"We cannot comprehend the greatness of his power for he directs the showers and storms that fall upon the earth."
What are you doing here, Roman?
You and I are finished.
We're shopping.
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
But I'm not anyone, Bill.
I'm the father of one of your wives.
How much longer are you going to be here?
It's too bad you feel so uncomfortable around your family.
I hope you get this fixed soon.
It's bad luck to open that indoors.
Before I forget, let me return some papers that Alby borrowed.
Interesting reading.
I must commend you on your work at beehive village.
The importance of preserving our great historical sites cannot be overstated.
What in God's name was he doing here?
I have no idea what he's up to, but...
I don't like it.
Bill, come on, you can't ignore me forever.
This is about a lot more than money, Nicki.
I'll take care of your debt, 'cause that's the honorable thing to do.
After that...
I don't know.
Barb, Barb, wake up.
He's gonna throw me out.
I'm serious.
I didn't think it would happen, not really really happen, but he is.
Nicki.
I'm history.
I'm gone.
- Barb--
- No.
Bill is not going to throw you out.
That's easy for you to say.
You're first wife.
You're protected.
I've seen it hundreds of times-- just drive an unwanted wife out to the edge of town and leave her by the side of the road like a sackful of unwanted kittens and drive off without so much as a glance in the rear-view.
Nicki, that is the most vile, preposterous story I've ever heard of.
It's true.
My father left a wife at a conoco station in Elko, Nevada.
Well, you need to have more faith in Bill.
And if he were to do that, I-
- I'd leave him.
Can I stay over with you tonight?
Of course you can.
Boys... we're staying the night at Barbara's.
Goodnight, Barb.
Well, I figure it was the same person who kept voting against me every time.
Am I right?
Am I right or am I wrong?
Margene, what is important is that we all agreed.
We wanted you in this family.
I knew you'd play dumb.
- How many of those did you get?
- Two dozen.
Well, that's enough for an army.
It's just Don and his wives and Betty.
Bill...
I know you don't like secrets and I know you don't like things hidden from you.
What are you trying to say, Nicki?
I'm going to put everything out on the table, Bill.
I mean, believe me, if I've learned anything from this, it's that honesty is the best policy.
My father helped me on the cards.
He's made payments from time to time and last month he gave me 3000.
God almighty!
What else have you kept hidden?
Deceitful, completely underhanded.
I can't believe this!
Unbelievable!
What happened?
- Well, where'd she go?
- She left.
- When's she coming back?
- I don't know.
Oh, you're early.
Well, come on in.
I won't be staying.
I just came to drop this off.
Betty made it.
Hey, we just got the fire going.
Well, Don says he's not staying.
Not staying?
Why not?
What's wrong?
Betty's been blackballed.
Oh no.
Oh boy.
Come on in.
Come on, sit down.
Come on, Don.
Have a seat over there.
What happened?
Peg was helping Betty pack some of her belongings to put into storage and she came across a copy of this thing called "the divine principle."
What's that?
It's the sacred text for the unification church.
Apparently, she spent some time with them before joining our group.
- She was a moonie.
- Oh, Don, oh.
And before that, she was a member of the family.
- What family?
- It's a cult, Margene.
There may have been others, too.
Ever hear of Bhagwan?
I remember she once talked about being in tune with the mother principle.
I just thought she wanted kids.
Ben, why don't you get don a box of kleenex?
The wives demanded a revote.
They don't believe she can commit.
They just think she's a lost soul.
Oh, this must be so hard.
Yeah.
I had to break it to her this morning.
We've been driving around for the last couple hours.
She's out in the car right now waiting for me.
I thought this was a slam dunk.
I'm sorry, everyone.
The Barbecue's off.
Hi.
I'm Margene.
I heard about what happened.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure I've ruined everyone's day.
No, you didn't.
The day was not going very well anyway.
I've been looking forward to meeting you, Betty.
I've heard a lot of great things, and I wasn't sure we'd have anything in common, but I know how it feels to be voted out.
It almost happened to me, too.
I know.
Don and Peg, Vernie and Jojo told me.
It's okay.
I'll be fine.
Well, why don't you just stay and hold it out?
Sometimes you have to let one train leave the station for a new one to come in.
No, stay.
Stay and prove them wrong.
How could you let them vote you out like that?
Why should we hold on to negative thoughts?
It's better to let them go.
I wanted to celebrate.
$2000 in lobsters down the drain, half not even cooked.
Bill, there are other tragedies at play, other than the price of lobster--
Don's heartbroken for his doe-eyed moonie;
and there are greater tragedies than a credit card debt of $60,000, too.
Poor Nicki.
Who knows what she's seen growing up in that world-- women and kittens thrown out like sacks of old potatoes?
Just... you think about that.
- Are you looking for something to eat?
- No.
I wanted to talk.
I was thinking about Betty, and it's too bad that she couldn't tell people who she really was.
I lied to you before.
About what?
The pancake breakfast.
I didn't tell you about it because I didn't want you to go.
You would have introduced yourself to all the other dads as Bill Henricks, father of three, with one wife, with one house.
It hurts to see you lie, dad.
I hate that about this life-- watching you and mom hide, all of us having to hide.
Dad, when's mom coming home?
Ma'am, it's sunday.
We closed at 6:00.
You're gonna have to leave.
Go on, scat!
What are you doing here so early?
I--I've been here all night.
I... had to get out of the house.
Why?
What happened?
I got it, I got it, I got it.
The-- the wives ganged up on me.
They're blaming me for not doing enough research on Betty.
They got really attached to her and they think it's my fault.
But what could I have done, Bill?
I've been thinking all night, too.
You know, we're constantly being tested.
Sometimes we just have to bend to God's will.
I guess, Betty just... wasn't part of his plan for you.
Four inches of rain in under an hour.
Wow, was it that much?
Your policy has a force majeure clause.
The damage should be covered.
A flash flood is considered an act of God.
Mr. Henrickson, urgent call on line two.
Mr. Henrickson, urgent call on line two.
Hey.
Thanks for what you said to me earlier.
Sometimes I forget that I'm not the one in the driver's seat.
You okay, Bill?
The land for the third store is gone.
Suddenly it's a historical site.
It-- it's a commercial zone.
Allegedly, some shoshones once had a winter camp there.
An injunction's been filed.
It's gonna be tied up in red tape for months, probably years.
That land was ours.
It was right there, right in our hands.
The surveyors are going out there tomorrow to do some more specs.
I mean, I can't believe our miserable bad luck.
It's not bad luck.
It's Roman.
I gave him what he wanted-- money.
And in return, he was supposed to give me what I wanted-- my freedom.
What do I have to do to get that man out of my life?
I need that store.
Yeah?
It's about Nicki.
She didn't come home last night.
She just called.
She said goodbye.
Hello?
Nick.
It's a job application.
I got stuck.
It asks for marital status, who to contact in case of an emergency.
What are you doing here?
The shelter kicks you out at 7:00 a.m.
Shelter?
What were you doing at a shelter?
How could I go to the compound... carrying the shame of a discarded woman, a throwaway?
Nicki... honey...
You made me feel that I had failed, that I wasn't in control.
I couldn't forgive you for that.
But I'm not in control of you and I love you anyways.
We made a covenant with each other.
We can disagree, we can argue-- we're human, but beneath that there's something strong-- family.
Nothing, nothing breaks that bond.
This isn't the compound, and I'm not my father.
We don't kick out family members.
Your father didn't kick you off the compound.
Mine did.
No, he didn't.
He was afraid of you.
I was 14 years old.
But your grandfather was the prophet.
My dad thought that you were too much like him-- whatever comes your way, you can handle.
You don't give up.
My father calls it pride.
Hi.
- I'm glad you're back.
- It's nice to be back.
I missed you.
I was scared.
You don't have to worry.
I was fine.
And I need to know my vote.
I need to know my vote.
I need you to tell me, please.
All right, Margene.
It was me, okay?
I was the holdout.
I thought you were too needy.
Needy?
How am I needy?
You need a lot of reassurance and you want to be the center of attention.
I was worried it would always be the Margene show.
This is a hard life.
I just thought you might not be ready.
Thank you.
Uptown pharmacy.
Can I help you ?
Hi, I'm calling for a refill.
Henrickson, William.
Hold on just one sec.
Hey.
Oh, honey, where are you?
Office.
I just got off the shuttle.
It started 15 minutes ago.
Oh, no.
That's viagra?
Prescription's for 200, but I just buy 20 at a time.
Got it.
Honey?
Honey, how long is it gonna take you?
- Not long.
- How many?
Just give me 20.
All right, take the 600 south exit, then straight up Sunnyside.
When will you be picking this up?
I'll swing by tomorrow.
That's not funny.
No-20.
See you soon.
Love you.
Society Hall, built in 1852 for social and cultural events.
The Utah Dramatic Association held many performances...
That's the Lucy Lewis farmstead, 1849, and next to that is the Hanlan House, 1847.
And you're not even pretending to listen.
Have you seen Zack Cady from the Chamber yet?
Why, you think he'd be interested in the Lucy Lewis farmstead?
Excuse me, councilman Davis?
Bill Henrickson.
You spoke at Rotary.
- Henrickson Home-
- Oh, sure!
Right, right, right.
This is my wife, Janelle.
How do you do?
You have that Home Store.
Two now- one in Sandy, a new one over in West Jordan.
Really got them scared over at Lowe's.
We're sponsoring one of the building renovations.
Donating materials for the seismic retrofit.
Barb, my wife.
It's a wonderful vision- preserving all this history.
It's all Bill talks about.
Well, a little bit.
I can't wait to bring my class.
Well, there's not much you can't accomplish with a good public/private partnership.
Big government-
- So you're a teacher?
- Copper Mountain elementary.
So where do you stand on merit-based salaries?
I believe you support it.
Superintendent Reinhardt opposes.
My union is hostile.
And the legislature doesn't seem to know what it thinks.
And you want my lowly opinion?
Absolutely.
Oh, thank you.
It's very flattering.
You know, my family on my mother's side, they were one in the first wave of pioneers to come to the valley...
I don't regret it.
It was a long, overdue clearing of the air.
Well, are you angry she's working or just the way she told us?
I told you I'm not angry.
Get raisins.
The yellow kind.
But if you were gonna take a job, wouldn't you check with all the people you were married to?
In fact, I'm surprised I'm not more angry.
Although she did call me pigheaded.
Yeah, well, you were pretty tough on her, too.
See, this is exactly what plural marriage teaches us.
The value of selflessness.
It's mine.
I just think she likes to work outside the house.
Aren't we supposed to support her, too?
Of course, we are.
You haven't been doing it as long as I have.
I mean here we are food shopping, again.
I can't remember the last time that woman pushed a grocery cart for family shopping.
Get the low-sodium ones.
Raymond, give me.
Drop it.
Boys.
Wayne!
Put it-put it back!
Has she said anything to you?
Uh, no.
- About me, I mean.
- No.
- No?
- No.
- Nothing?
- No!
Well, I'm glad we had it out.
I feel better, I do.
Just hope she's able to rise above the pettiness.
I'm gonna run over to the drug store aisle- get some lotion.
You watch the boys?
New dress?
Hmm, just haven't had the occasion.
Well, I think the councilman will remember me next time.
Why?
He couldn't take his eyes off you.
It's true.
Well, neither could his wife.
She kept checking for my garment line.
I thought she was gonna get down on her hands and knees and peak up my dress to see if I was wearing them.
What?
Okay.
- Wait, uh-uh, uh-uh-
- Okay, ee-ee-
Oh my.
Golly.
Where did that come from?
You are so beautiful.
Stop.
This is Margie's night.
It's not like we planned it.
Well.
Hi.
I didn't hear you.
I've got the water running upstairs.
I got you a burger.
It's on the table in the bag.
I'll put it in the microwave when I come back down.
Oh, Lester pooped on your robe, but it's almost out of the dryer.
Gotta go, gotta go!
Morning, Margene.
Teenie, that bottle was brand new.
You cannot have this much syrup, young lady.
It is not good for you.
It's fortified.
Sarah, have you seen my backpack?
I don't know.
Is it in your room?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi.
I enjoyed last night.
Me too.
I thought I'd made it up.
No, ma'am.
Well.
Yeah.
Thanks for calling.
No problem.
You know what?
Just decided, I'm not gonna get dressed all day today.
Are you feeling all right?
Fine.
Uh, just gonna have a do-nothing day.
Hey, what time you taking lunch today?
Uh, what?
What time are you taking lunch today?
1:00.
I wanna see you again.
Can you meet me?
Um-
Where?
There.
- Here?
- Yes.
Okay.
Margie?
Have a nice day, Barb.
Honey?
You can't live one out of three days for Bill and the rest just camped out here.
I don't mind.
I know.
But one of the best things about how we live is we're a community.
The kids should feel comfortable and safe in each of the houses because it's a home.
My house isn't a home?
Make it nice for yourself.
Why don't you finally unpack?
I bet if you spend a little time and invest in your home, you won't even wanna leave.
Yeah?
Good.
Thank you.
Come on, honey.
What are you doing?
Barb kicked me out.
She told me to get a life.
That was harsh.
It's like she doesn't have time for us since she took the job.
Which is exactly what I suspected would happen.
No one's suggesting some all-out war.
- Just some firmness.
- That's right.
Joey offered up this information and it's worth following up on.
Well, at least this guy's fair.
I mean, he actually came to us to include our group's thoughts in the polygamy primer that they put out to all the social service agencies.
He doesn't have an axe to grind, doesn't just listen to all the anti-polygamist crazies.
- Is that a five?
- 555-5807.
What's my cover?
It's an anonymous tip.
Attorney general's office.
Alan Kenectle, please.
I'll connect you.
- Polygamy Czar.
- Is Alan Kenectle in?
What is this regarding?
Uh, my name is Robert Zeebold.
Yes?
I'm here in Salt Lake.
Uh, a polygamist swindled my mother, got her to invest in a land scheme.
What polygamist?
Roman Grant.
Hold on a moment.
They solicited your mother?
Yeah, she was told she was buying shares to a ranch up in Box Elder County.
Along with 10 others.
Old folks.
Making 11, total.
Oh, they're suing.
And I guess I just wanted to know if you were aware of that and if your office, if- since your office uh- since the attorney general investigates uh, consumer fraud, and since you're a part of and investigate um, polygamy,
could you do anything?
An investigation or-
Could you come down to our offices?
I'd like to sit down with you and uh, maybe you could bring your mother.
We've been trying to get into Juniper Creek forever.
Maybe we could piggyback an investigation.
What firm is representing the claimants?
Uh, the name of her attorney?
Yeah.
I'll have to get that information from her.
Could I call you back?
What's your direct number?
Oh, whoa, I dropped my pen.
Just-
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
All right, got it.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, you, you have a great day, too.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Margie?
Anybody?
I couldn't decide where to be.
This is perfect.
- It's mine!
- Mine!
I have tylenol in the glove compartment.
I need something stronger.
We still have to get the car mats and the towels.
Why can't we finish up after lunch, Nicki?
It takes so much effort to load up the boys in and out of the car.
- Mom!
- Turn the air on your face.
- Make him stop!
- Hey.
I gotta go home.
I gotta lay down for a minute.
What's the big deal?
- Why can't he get car mats at the store?
- I said, "knock it off. "
Wanna watch a movie tonight?
No.
I gotta learn to be more independent.
Please put this in your mouth.
Come on, safety first, gentlemen.
Always safety first.
Strong, full released position.
With your wood in place... turn on the machine.
Great, that's just great.
- Yeah, I appreciate the call.
- Bill.
- You bet.
Bye.
- Bill, where you been?
- We have a problem.
- That was Lee Hatcher.
Last guy convicted of selling bogus land sales, he got two million in fines.
Wait, wait, we have a problem.
- Mr. Henrickson.
- Wendy?
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Certainly.
Should I close the door?
Thank you.
I, I know you're a busy man-
Please.
Never too busy.
Come on in.
What's on your mind?
Have a seat.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I've rehearsed this in my head, but it's still hard.
I saw Mr. and Mrs. Embry at Applebee's on saturday.
I was at the salad bar with my mom when they came in with two other women.
Okay.
Something wasn't right.
Something... not natural.
I could tell.
So when the two other ladies went to the rest room, I followed them.
I know it was wrong, but I had to.
They were talking about whose turn it was to cut Mr. Embry's hair.
I don't understand.
They're polygamists.
But... how do you know they weren't his sisters?
You have sisters, right?
Not like that.
Maybe Don's sisters are like that, or they're-their aunts or nieces.
- Did you think of that?
- I know what I saw.
And it's against the church, and the law.
Wendy... as long as the people that work here are doing their jobs, what they do in their bedrooms is none of our concern.
Now...
Don's always treated you with respect and if I'm not mistaken, it was Peg that hired you.
And I can tell you unequivocally, Don's not what you're saying he is.
Everyone in the Henrickson Home Plus family is treated with respect.
Hasn't that been your experience?
- Yes, sir.
- That's right.
So let's get off this subject.
It's very unsavory.
But I know what I saw.
What you saw was an action, but you didn't necessarily see the label you're putting on it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Exactly.
There you are.
Why are you doing that?
You don't want me to?
Never look me in the eyes when you address me.
You may refile those now.
Yeah, look at this.
The numbers are phony.
It's just the digest of the numbers, not the numbers themselves.
Exactly.
Alby.
His wives tell him he's a genius.
He's no genius.
Well, this tells you nothing.
I know.
What I wanted was the exact audited numbers with the accountant's opinion letter.
I wanna know exactly what's going on with both Home Plus stores.
What's this?
Beautiful flowers for my beautiful wives.
What?
That was funny- when we saw each other on Cloverfield ave.
- You were driving very fast.
- Yeah.
Must've been very late.
Getting back to work.
I thought so.
You got your hands full.
Um...
I never really moved in.
And everything from before...
I hate.
So...
What are you working on?
Don't just stand there.
Come on over, I'll show you.
I know it's a little over the top, but it relaxes me.
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
How many children do you have?
Oh, we don't have.
It's just an hour a day after school.
Everyone goes to seminary.
Every mormon.
And I don't want you to be one.
I just
- I have to.
I don't feel pure.
I think there's something inside me that shouldn't be there.
No.
You'll get all judgmental and arrogant because you're in the priesthood.
You'll turn into a snotty asshole just like the rest of them.
Serious, you'll be like every other mormon boy I've ever dated.
I have these dreams, okay?
I think about sex all the time.
But that's good.
No!
I can't control it.
I get hard-ons in Woodshop.
They'll brainwash you, make you think your body is dirty.
Don't let them ruin you.
So... don't, okay?
Okay.
Hello?
Who is this?
Levelor.
Well, this is Nicolette Grant.
I want to speak to Wanda Henrickson right now.
He has been slipping and sliding all over the place.
- All sorts of monkey business.
- Nicki, Nicki, slow down, slow down.
You're not making any sense.
He's been so happy.
And he saw me in the car and pretended he didn't see me.
And then he gave us flowers to throw me off the trail.
- Don't you see?
- You don't think he's-
He is.
Yes, he is seeing a fourth wife.
This is exactly what he did when he got interested in Margene.
Honestly, I knew even before I knew.
You know?
It's so easy to see through them.
They're kind of cute that way.
But he hasn't told you?
That's not right.
The situation is delicate.
You know Barb- she's so resistant to change.
Oh, he's gonna need me to smooth things out with her.
I'm so excited, Wanda.
I'm so happy for us.
I'm so happy.
Then I'm happy for you.
Barb- first wives think they know everything, but really they just walk around in a fog.
Anyway, four's a better number.
To tell you the truth,
I'm really bored with Barb.
And Margie.
- Nicki, no.
- I am.
Bored, bored, bored.
Oh, you know what I mean.
But don't tell anyone.
"And since our fates we may not conquer here, divide thy lot from mine and the starlit world above us, call me thine, forever thine. "
That's so beautiful.
You're a diamond.
Come in.
Papa?
I, uh, I wanted to say that I was sorry.
I should have known better.
But I have redrafted another demand letter for Henrickson Home Plus, and this time I'll do it right.
I'll get the right numbers.
It's not your fault, son.
I gave you more responsibility than you can handle.
Your talents lie elsewhere.
We all have our gifts.
You let Bill get the better of us.
I can give you a lift home.
- I can't do numbers, either.
- Shut up!
I'm trying to be nice!
And don't you ever raise your voice to me like that again.
I wanna see you.
Um, well, I, I made a date to have lunch with another teacher.
Can you cancel?
All right.
How soon?
45 minutes.
I've got a place in mind.
Where?
Any luggage?
What are we doing?
What do you think?
We're having an affair.
Well, technically, how can it be an affair?
We're married.
- What is it?
- My necklace-
- I lost my necklace.
- Don't worry, we'll find it.
Hey...
What?
You'll see.
Ready?
Remember?
Hurry.
Hey, boss.
You heard from the AG?
I didn't, but Robert Zeebold did.
They need that attorney.
This is great.
Hey.
Hi, it's me.
I just wanted you to know, I'm not stupid.
You don't have to keep secrets from me.
That's not the way this family works.
You can talk to me.
I'm happy to help in any way I can.
Do you want me to be the one to break the news?
Can you be a little more specific?
Fine.
If that's how you wanna play it.
I think what you're doing is wrong.
I don't know what you're talking about, Wendy.
You do know what I'm talking about.
I'm sorry Wendy, but I don't.
Is everything okay?
Is there something you wanna say?
I've got my eye on you.
And I know my rights.
You can't fire me or get me fired for doing and saying what I know is right.
Now why would I wanna go and do something like that?
You're the best little junior bookkeeper we've ever had.
There's a problem.
What?
Look out the window.
Just look.
Uh, it's not that you can't see her.
I would never tell you who your friends can be, but we have to be careful, so careful now, with the second store.
I am.
I know you are.
Okay, then.
You're the weak link, Margie.
What?
We have to be realistic.
You can't keep a secret like me, and you're not a good liar like Barb.
What do you mean I'm a good liar?
With the neighbors.
You're so effortless.
You're a pro.
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.
Did you and Bill have relations before he brought you home to us to be a wife?
No, Nicki!
And I think that is completely none of your business!
Is it?
Look me in the eyes, Margene.
I am not gonna do the look-me-in-the-eye thing.
Look me in the eye.
I thought as much.
How could you?
No, Nicki!
You think you know everything?
You look me in the eye for once, hmm?
You look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye!
I'm looking at you with my eyes!
I brought you some design books.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Make sure you look at that feng shui one.
I know it seems loony but I'm telling you, it works.
Um, do you wanna come in?
I'd love to.
Thanks.
This is great.
You can do a lot with this place.
Aaron.
I'm sorry.
He just discovered his penis.
Don't they all?
What a precious angel.
Where's daddy?
Gone.
Oh, listen to me, barging in, asking personal questions.
No, no, no, no.
I'm so glad you're here.
I know we just met, but I really like you.
I know.
Do you like orange juice?
Who doesn't?
Yeah.
My name is Ben Henrickson.
I live with my two sisters, my mom and dad.
Henrickson Home Plus.
Anyone?
Anyone other than Jason?
Okay, thank you, Ben, and welcome to seminary, young man.
Congratulations.
You've chosen the right.
Bill, it's Joey.
How are you?
Didn't recognize the number.
I finally got us a cell phone.
I have the name of the attorney you wanted on the lawsuit.
Joseph Breedman.
He lives in Logan.
Joey, you are sunshine on a cloudy day.
- Oh, well-
- So how'd you get the name?
Um, dad.
Thinks he's cagey, but he's a blowhard.
Just gotta get him in a windbag kind of mood, I guess.
You want the address and name of this guy and stuff?
Yeah, shoot.
Okay.
Joseph Breedman...
Breedman...
Logan, 3000 Parkland way, suite 151.
You sure you don't need anything down there?
A ceiling fan, whatever?
No, we're great.
We're happy.
Uh, Wanda says big things are happening up there, though.
Say what?
Going for your number four, huh?
What?
Wife, fourth wife.
What?
!
Nicki?
I have to speak to you.
Alone.
I'm gone.
Barb, I didn't wanna bring you into this.
And I'm not sure Bill wants you to know, actually.
But something's changed.
Bill is dating someone, a fourth wife.
Oh Barb, there's no time forhat now.
But, I don't
- Are you sure?
I don't think so.
I do.
And may I say, she is certainly not the kind of fourth wife we would want.
He's having relations with her.
What?
Well, he is susceptible.
I happen to know for a fact that he had relations premaritally with one of us.
And I'm not naming names, but it wasn't me and it certainly wasn't you.
It was Marge.
And it's not right.
Hmm, hmm, maybe it is true, but what difference does it make now?
What do you want me to do with this information?
Well we have to stop him.
Sit him down.
Of course we have to find out who it is, who's bringing this sin into our house.
Obviously it's not someone from the compound.
Well, obviously- yeah.
Do you like Fields Market?
There's always good coupons in the circular and the produce always seems so crisp and fresh.
Yes, it is.
I was just next door.
Isn't it terrible what happened to Margene's husband?
The gulf war-
Too many lives, such a shame.
Well, I guess that's all wars, isn't it?
Margie, Margie, what were you thinking?
She lent me some design books.
You can't just run around saying whatever it is that pops into your head.
No!
I've thought about it a lot.
And I don't like that unwed mother story you tell about me.
I never say you're unwed.
I say you're presently single.
But I don't like that, either.
And anyway, you're the one that told me to get a life.
All right, you are putting your family at risk.
I don't have any friends any more.
I know how isolating it can be, but uh- that's a sacrifice we make.
We have to stick with it, no matter how lonely it can be because there isn't anything else that can bring us these rewards.
This is um- this is it.
And sweetheart, the gulf war was 15 years ago.
Let me see, let me see.
All right, let me see...
One, two, three...
Hey, I got something.
What do you got?
"Many elements go into making a great room.
The most important is color. "
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Me, too.
Thinking about you.
Meet me in a half an hour?
I don't think I can, Bill.
I- we can't do this.
I need you.
I feel like I'm drowning, like I can't catch my breath.
I'm going to the White Birch.
I'll wait a half an hour.
If you don't show up, I'll understand.
I'll meet you in a half an hour.
Where are you going?
To the office.
Always something.
Be back soon.
Hello?
Sarah?
Nicki?
Do you want mom?
Yes.
She just took off.
Are you still there?
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.
She was all giddy and gross, though.
She wanted to borrow some lip gloss.
We have a beautiful straight out of Africa, retails at 699.99.
In less than a minute, we have it here today at 199.99.
I can't believe this price-
199.99.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime-
Nicki!
Nicki, come quick!
Nicki!
Where's dad?
He's at the office.
What happened?
There's a man!
He went around front.
All right, stay here, call Margene, and get the babies over here, okay?
Where's Bill?
He's sleeping.
Wake him.
Talk to me, Alby.
What do you need?
I do need something.
I wanna talk to Mr. Clever.
Tried to put one over on me.
Nicki?
Everything's all right, Benny.
Look Benny, go next door, go to my house.
Hey Benny, what's up?
Go away, get out of here.
I'll have papa come down on you like a ton of bricks.
You?
You were a nothing till you married Bill.
A nothing of no earthly consequence.
Now look at you, strutting around like Mrs. Home Plus.
Bill took you in to get a loan from papa.
Don't you know that?
You're just collateral.
Don't think, Alby.
It's not what you're good at.
Roughing up teenagers and scaring women is what you do.
Wanna show me what you're made of?
You can't do it, can you?
Take your one testicle and fly back to your cave.
You ever show up here again and harass this family, I swear to god I will kill you!
My dad didn't send him.
Alby's just- he's just a loose cannon that way.
She was really cool.
I'm just thankful everyone is safe.
All right.
Let's all go to bed.
Oh, there's something I wanna say to everyone.
I wanna bring another soul into the family.
Nicki.
It's time.
We've been holding off for this reason or that.
It's time, now.
We've let worldly concerns come before what we're here for-
- Nicki.
- What our purpose is.
Honey.
I'm so happy.
As your husband, father-to-be and member of our holy family.
Congratulations, Nicki.
I love you, Nicki.
I love you too, Barb.
I love you very much.
A baby.
A sister.
Margie.
Come on, come on.
Yeah.
Come on, that's a good girl.
What a good girl that is.
Morning, Nita.
Good morning, dear.
Look at that back yard.
It was too dark to see it last night.
It's a fairyland.
Hot water with lemon, Bill?
No, thanks.
I gotta get to the office.
On holy saturday?
We're open every day except Christmas.
And you'll see the attorney?
Yes.
He's a good attorney, is he?
Oh, yeah.
Your eyes are a little red, Bill.
Pollen.
Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Lola!
Lola!
Lola!
Bill... we want to thank you for your charity in our hour of need, our dark night of the soul.
You ladies, have a nice day.
Morning, rathead.
Grandma up yet?
Nope.
I've spoken to Babcock, Price and Coggins,
I've advised them there's an avalanche of litigation that's about to bury Roman.
They've indicated a willingness to discuss settlement.
I am not negotiating.
I'm not getting in the gutter with them, I already tried that.
That's what led to this--
All due respect, Bill, your take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum was not a negotiation.
I do not want to cut a deal, I want to crush him!
He's thrown my family to the wind like leaves, and I want to bring him to his knees.
So you're magically going to do what the states of Utah and Arizona have been unable to accomplish for the past 50 years?
So be it.
Unjust enrichment against UEB and Roman Grant,
I need your mother and brother's signatures.
Unfair termination of employment against Eagle Gas and UEB as trustees in the name of Lois Henrickson, mother's signature.
Discovery motions for both suits;
action against Roman Grant and UEB declaring loan agreement unenforceable under the UCC, I need your signature.
Tort action against Roman Grant for physical assault of Lois Henrickson in said forcible eviction.
Nasty.
How much?
$500,000 in pain and suffering.
And last, but not least, breaking and entry trespass claim against Albert Grant for events surrounding forced entry and break-in at Home Plus on or about april 2nd, one mill smackers.
Now you sign that, there is no turning back.
Bill just can't keep him exiled out there forever.
Even with Pam and Carl gone, it's like sending up a flare.
Bill's adamant.
He can't just sit out there and pee in the azaleas.
I wouldn't let him in your house if I were you.
He makes Joey crazy, Bill hates him and he doesn't pee in the toilet.
Bill's not very good about lifting the seat, either.
No, Nicki, he pees in the sink.
Well, still, families need to find closure and move on.
It's Easter.
Maybe now's that time.
Maybe some transgressions aren't forgivable.
At the end of the day, a loving family should find everything forgivable, else what's the point in being a family?
Here they come.
Big fat hypocrites.
Act all pious, but they're really mean.
Morning.
What are you doing?
What's up?
He absolutely, positively will not be in this house, but he promised that he's going to stay at Margene's with Nita and Lourdez and...
- Oh great.
- ...
Sue-Sue.
Oh no, I knew it.
I saw you this morning.
What are you doing so early in the day?
Seeing the old attorney, weren't you?
Don't get comfortable.
Don't make yourself at home and don't get any ideas.
I know.
You sleep in the middle house, and you stay in the middle house.
- I'm leaving.
Okay, yeah.
- That's it.
You got it?
You hear me?
- We need to talk, asap.
- Yeah, we sure do.
Hello again, Bill.
Uh...
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Say, we have to do some shopping.
Oh well, I'm sure you can go shopping with Barb.
No.
We need to borrow a car, I think.
Margie, lend Nita your car.
Why can't you take Frank's truck?
No, we never drive Frank's truck.
Now that's it.
It's settled.
Nita, take Margie's car.
Thank you.
Thank you for your hospitality and generosity again.
If it weren't for you, we'd be naked at the mercy of the elements, completely on our uppers.
Bless you, Bill.
Bless your soul.
- Oh no, back out.
- No no no.
- I don't want you and mom in the same house.
- I'm leaving.
I just want you to know I've been thinking.
I got a couple of suits of my own.
Yeah.
I want to sue that motel for evicting us.
Hey, they violated the 1964 civil rights act.
Hotels are public places.
You can't discriminate on account of religion.
You weren't evicted because you had four wives.
You were evicted because the lousy scotch tape you wrapped around Nita's cord on her crockpot made it explode, causing a fire that burnt down two rooms!
Well they don't know that.
The fire marshal say that?
No.
You know why?
'Cause I went in there and took the crockpot out after the fire.
You would do anything for a buck.
I'm thinking of suing Roman, too. $300,000 for dispossession.
- For what?
- For my house.
That dump?
Plywood, tarpaper, and used shag carpeting?
It's not worth the powder to blow it up.
- Oh, dear.
- It was worth it to me, sir.
$300,000 for the house, half a mil for pain and suffering.
Bud, you got lemons, you make lemonade.
Now, come on, give me the attorney's number.
Oh, please.
Give me the attorney's number.
How hard is that?
Get your own darn attorney.
And get out.
I told you so.
Oh, look at this trash.
Lois, brought you some orange juice.
I wasn't sure if you were awake.
Would you look at all this frou-frou?
Can hardly sleep a wink with all these pillows and this fluffy stuff.
It's pretty fluffy in our bed too.
You feel like you're going to drown in it.
It's not right for young girls to have so many things.
Hey, sleepyhead.
Hi, Wanda.
- Mom, how you doing?
- Oh, fine, fine, Bill.
We apologize for having so disrupted your lives.
And we forgive you for having so disrupted ours.
Well.
You all are welcome here for however long this takes.
Now, just sign these and we'll have old Roman and the UEB in court.
At long last.
Henrickson's dispossessed.
We have been exiled.
I will get you back home.
I miss my things, Bill.
Well, just make a list.
We'll take you shopping.
My father's bible?
His book of mormon?
My-my photographs.
I know, I know, mother, and I'm sorry.
We're not going to do some shopping for keepsakes such as those.
- Arf arf arf!
- Did I hear your father?
Don't you worry.
He's in the other house and you do not have to see him.
Oh mama, please.
I am on bended knee.
For ever I beg, this is the time.
Please, please help me.
And what is the nature of your problem?
I've done something that Bill doesn't know about and papa does;
and papa knows that Bill doesn't know and if it should come out, I'm...
I'll lose Bill.
And what is it you've done?
I owe $60,000 in credit cards.
Yes, and?
No "and," just that.
I've been so bad.
How so?
I owe $60,000 in credit cards!
I owe 90.
We needed a new bedroom when your father took Rhonda,
I put it on my discover.
We all owe up to our necks.
We all spend like there is no tomorrow, which we were told there wouldn't be on three occasions.
But your father's revelations have been a little bit off the mark lately, and we're still here.
So, see?
Under the circumstances, it's excusable.
Well, not down here it isn't.
Here it's a really big deal.
If Bill finds out, he'll kick me out.
I know he will.
Why shouldn't he?
That seems a bit harsh, Nicolette.
I'm begging.
Will you talk to papa for me?
I mean, he might listen to you.
That's true.
I'll take it under advisement.
Hello, dumb lizard.
What are you looking at?
Hi.
Grandma?
Grandma, I brought you some plain polyester pillows, no feather, no down.
Oh, Sarah, aren't you so thoughtful?
You didn't used to be.
When you were two, you slapped me.
I didn't like you for a very long time.
You hold your cards close to your vest, don't you?
Me too.
I don't know for certain if they took it or just copied it, but the first quarterly report was missing and the second was next to the fax machine.
What did he look like, exactly?
Surely you got a name.
What about accounts receivable?
They were in a heap.
A stack of vendors' accounts were found out in the parking lot.
Sorry about that.
Let's get back to business.
So what's the bottom line?
They took my quarterlies.
And Tom from IT said there were fingerprints all over the system.
Somebody tried to hack in.
Apparently they were able to make several trips to their car before being apprehended.
All right.
If they didn't hack into the system, then we're probably okay.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Well I don't care what he told you.
I do not want him using our attorney.
The answer is "no."
Nobody knows it was Albert Grant.
Thanks, Dan.
We don't want to worry any people unnecessarily.
Are you all right, sir?
Fine, thanks.
Wendy?
Anything else?
A lot of the employees are talking.
All kinds of rumors have started up.
People know the burglar was caught and then let go.
And they have concocted some truly wild scenarios to explain why the police weren't called in.
I tell them, "you can be sure Mr. Henrickson has his reasons."
But is there something I could say to them?
Something you'd like me to say to put an end to all this gossip?
Wendy, if the police gets involved, if this becomes a matter of public record, our insurance goes sky-high through the roof.
Now, we'll handle it, privately.
And I tell you this in strictest confidence.
You understand?
Okay.
Bill, Bill, Bill.
Hateful.
Ugh, not again.
He did it in my sink and he splashed it on the counter and faucets.
Gross.
Grandpa?
Sarah, just take Teenie and please go outside.
That is disgusting.
That is so disgusting.
- What is?
- Never mind.
Can you stop him?
Can someone stop him?
I'm not eating tonight.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Yes you are.
He didn't pee in the casserole or the cobbler and I'm disinfecting.
When's dinner?
A few hours.
Barb, we told Margene we have to go shopping.
We haven't heard back.
Well, what do you need?
Clorox.
We have everything for dinner tonight, and Easter dinner too.
What are you cooking for Easter?
Turkey.
What else?
Oh, no.
Frank likes ham, and yams with marshmallows.
No marshmallows.
The kids get enough sugar as is.
I said beat it!
But a ham would give us such a shot in the arm and bolster our spirits.
Not Easter without ham.
Hi everybody-
- Oh no.
No, I told you twice to stay away.
Third time, you're out.
Get your feet off the couch.
Come on, I'm being polite.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
She's not even here.
What are you being overprotective of her for?
She's like one of Roman's humvees.
You know, the woman is a tank.
- One, two--
- I'm going, okay?
I'm going.
You know, it's supposed to be our honeymoon though and for some reason you seem to be trying to keep us apart.
What are you so startled for?
You're the one who bought--
I need some fresh soap.
What are you doing here?
He's just leaving.
Your husband is peeing in the sink.
You are still doing that?
Oh, Frank, you are such a pig.
And you are such a witch.
Barb, this soap smells.
It's supposed to smell, Lois.
Yeah, it is, grandma.
No, soap is not supposed to smell.
Well, we'll get you some that doesn't smell.
We'll get it when we go shopping!
Get them your keys.
They're guests.
We better get out of here before she changes her mind.
Bye, Margene.
Bill?
Margie, I don't feel very well.
I need you to take me to the emergency room.
I don't think I can drive.
- What's wrong.
- Now.
We got to go.
Hurry.
Okay okay.
Well, you don't appear to have a brain tumor.
And you haven't had a heart attack or a stroke... yet.
Joke.
What's wrong with me?
Uh, Mrs. Henrickson?
Could you give us a minute, please?
It's okay, honey.
Do you use sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil?
Sexual performance enhancement drugs?
No.
Yeah.
It's your eyes. 25 or 50 milligrams?
100.
For how long?
Couple months.
Frequency?
Two, three times a day.
A man your age is not designed to perform like a horse.
And ought not to be expected to perform at the same level as a man of 25.
When will the effects wear off?
When the drug leaves your system.
When was the last time you took some?
One last night... another this morning.
This morning's was the 36-hour kind.
He said it was stress, high blood pressure.
Stress spikes over the holidays, especially with family.
Send them away.
Ugh, they're horrible, Bill.
And that horrible dog?
Put them in a motel or a shelter or under a bridge, but if Pam comes home, and she even sees his truck--
Margie!
My blood pressure.
Now, I'm taking care of it.
But we need to keep this to ourselves.
I don't want to alarm Nicki and Barb.
Hi.
How you doing?
How are you doing?
I'm a mess.
This is really hard, Bill.
I know.
I wanted to call you last night.
I don't regret having ended it.
It was the right thing to do.
For the family.
I feel...
I feel robbed.
Like they've stolen you from me.
Do you think I'm selfish?
No, you're not selfish.
No.
Yeah.
Did you know that Fedex did afternoon deliveries on saturday?
What?
Tough day for Bill Henrickson.
You better swing by my office.
What the heck?
"The time has come," the walrus said.
Appears Roman's getting into the litigation game, suing you.
Suing me?
What do we got here?
Breach of contract, $5 million in injunctive relief.
Got a claim of tortious false imprisonment of one Albert Grant at the premises of Home Plus.
No, he broke into my store.
Not proven.
Your security guard cuffed him and restrained him.
Half a mil.
Next, a suit for assault and battery against one Lois Henrickson.
My mother?
They assaulted her.
They grabbed her and-and they manhandled her.
Says here she assaulted back, kicked one Zevon Dalton in the testicles.
It was in self-defen-- 300 thou in compensatory, one mil punitive.
Pricey set of balls.
There's some good news.
I ran into the docket clerk at lunch.
If we file on monday, we can be in front of a judge in eight to 10 weeks.
I can't wait to try those little marshmallows.
Looks so good.
Here we go.
There's a scratch on my car, a really big scratch, and you're the ones that put it there.
- That's impossible.
- No!
Very possible.
You're the only ones who drove it.
- Well, it wasn't us.
- Was!
Margie, it isn't worth it.
They scratched my car, Nicki.
Nicki, if you don't mind.
You ought to get control of her.
You scratched my car!
Margie.
Do you or Barb have any honey, honey?
We forgot it.
Where's Bill?
He went upstairs.
Are you all right?
Hmm?
Fine.
What's wrong?
Mmm, nothing.
Just...
I'm sad.
Why?
Is there anything I can do?
No, Nicki.
Okay.
The united states has made clear to leaders on every continent that there is no such thing as a good terrorist and a bad terrorist.
You cannot condemn Al Qaeda... and hug Hamas.
What has gone wrong with the world?
Civilization gone rotten.
Uppity.
Barb?
Honey?
- I got one!
- I saw it first.
- Look, there's more over here.
- I don't think that was your egg.
- Psst, Joey.
- Hey.
You and I are going to the compound tonight to meet with Roman.
I set it up. 8:00.
I thought you said no negotiating, Bill.
I thought you said stand pat.
I want Roman off my books as a silent partner.
Look, there's several million in real estate I can't make until he is.
That's why I reorganized the franchise to erase his presence from the books but I got greedy.
I thought I could stop payments to him at the same time.
I wanted my cake and eat to.
So what are you going to do?
Sit down face to face and make a deal.
What kind of deal?
A deal that gets you all back home.
We'll take Nicki's car, less recognizable. 8:00.
We'll tell everybody we have tickets to the jazz-spurs game.
You all right?
Your eyes...
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What time we going?
8:00.
Here's one!
Honey, it's mother.
I asked your father about that little matter and it turns out that he ran a DB on you, your $60,000 all laid out with payment history.
I honestly can't say what he plans on doing with it.
Mom, I know you and I have had our differences, but, can you please help me out on this one?
How can I?
I won't be in the meeting.
Meeting?
Bill and your father, tonight, 8:00.
Mom?
Mom is in the doghouse.
Oh, mommy's goose is about to get cooked.
You're not too old for Easter-egg hunting?
Joey.
Oh, I guess I am.
But the raccoons aren't.
Where's Nicki and Marge?
I don't know.
Why?
I was just curious.
Seems Nita and the rest are always together.
Mom's a recluse.
And you?
How's Wanda?
She's fine.
She just worries about me too much.
- There.
- There you go.
Went by the DWS, state employment agency, filled out what they call a standard job application.
And 150 bucks registering at an employment agency.
Just want to start over here, get an apartment with Wanda and the baby.
That's wonderful, Joey.
I think I'm done with the compound.
Wanda worries I'll get in trouble again, but it's...
I don't know that I believe in polygamy anymore, Barb.
Don't tell Bill though.
What does Wanda think?
I haven't told her.
She's afraid that she and I won't be together in the celestial kingdom
- unless I--
- You're a monogamist.
I guess so.
Look, Barb... the only way I know what to believe in is to listen to my heart.
And it says that Wanda's it for me.
Strange how... you're polygamous here.
Don't you think?
Well...
Cool.
What are you doing?
Taking a leak.
Boys, boys, go in the other room.
- Aw!
- Go on.
Get down off that stepladder right now.
I'm almost finished.
In my sink?
In front of my sons!
Always women in the bathroom, no matter how many bathrooms.
You hang on to your garbage too long, uremic poisoning.
Even worse: kidney failure.
Stop peeing right now!
Margie, stay back.
You vile man.
You don't belong in a house.
You belong in a stall!
Bill.
No.
Stop, now!
Stop, now!
Hey hey.
Get a helper.
You may come inside my houses once a day for one meal for one half hour and one half hour in the morning to bathe and that's it!
There.
How does it feel?
It's hot.
Mercy.
Why did you cut your hair?
It's different from the other women in the compound.
Does your father ever talk about your aunt Margaret?
Well, he should.
She drowned in Lake Meade.
After Margaret died...
I was bone sad.
Now... we hadn't always been ignorant.
We were once a learned, serious people.
My daddy, your great grandfather Orville, he taught me when I was a girl.
He told me stories about ancient peoples, how when they had tragedy, sorrow, how they would "shorn" their hair.
So when Maggie...
I just cut it all off.
And Nita and sisterwives and Frank, they hated me for it.
'Cause it made me different, I think.
Everybody thought I was proud, and ugly, but ugly and special.
Marked.
Marked.
Who'd like some mashed potatoes?
And gravy?
Should we pass around the gravy?
- Let's pass it around the table.
- Mom, it smells really good.
- Just pass it around.
- Where's the bread?
I'll carve.
I love to carve.
- Nita.
- Thank you.
Bill, sit down.
Sit down.
Hey, do you have any butter?
I can do this.
I know Bill likes dark meat.
Right, Bill?
Only if it's moist and...
Barb, where's Lois?
I'm sure Bill would like to have his mother here with us.
- Here you go, mom.
- Oh, she'll be over.
Don't worry about her.
Leave her to her own sorry self.
Just cut me a piece of meat, please.
Here you go, Nicki.
Mashed potatoes?
Thanks.
Joey.
Remember?
"I got it!
I got-
- I got it!
Oh..."
Nope.
That's not funny, Frank.
It wasn't funny the first time.
It's not funny now.
I'm sorry.
You've shown us such charity and compassion.
I wish we could all go throw ourselves down a well and be out of your hair.
No.
You're entirely welcome here.
I'll have some beans there, fumbles.
I told you old man, you lay off Joey or else.
Or else what?
Or else I'll finish the job someone else started.
I'll kill you!
Everybody, please stop.
Stop what?
Please stop picking on Frank.
That's about all anyone's been doing since we arrived.
- The woman's absolutely right.
- Listen, you--
The hostess would like to remind everyone to attempt to behave.
We appreciate your charity, Bill, but you're the reason all of us are out of our homes.
No, no.
Let's just speak the truth.
You'd be in a safe comfortable motel if it wasn't for your junky crockpot.
That motel was horrible.
Filth on the television.
As a matter of fact, we don't want to be here with you any more than you want us here.
Well you're not cutting that right.
You're cutting with the grain.
Hey!
Go back to your table.
But she's carving scraps.
I like hunks of meat.
Well I thought you only liked ham.
Sit down!
Maybe it's because somebody scratched my car and won't admit it.
I did not scratch your car!
I told you they were all liars.
And you leave Margene alone.
You bully.
Look at this.
All made up like a poodle.
"Madame Fifi."
Sitting at the small table, are you?
You big good-for-nothing.
Listen here, Fifi, don't you come sweeping in here, all done up like some kind of a poodle, telling me that I'm good for nothing.
Dad?
Knock it off.
Arf arf arf!
Frank.
Don't bark at Lois.
Arf arf arf!
That's it!
You, leave the table now!
This is Easter.
It has meaning for our family.
Go!
I hate this.
I can't stand it.
Wanda.
Wanda.
Wanda.
- Wanda, where you going?
- Get in!
Get in the car if you love me.
Come on, just take a breath.
No no.
We got to get out of here now.
How long till you crack?
- How long?
- Listen to me, listen to me.
I'm not going to crack.
I'm going to get a job.
Listen.
I'm going to get a job.
And I'm going to get us an apartment here to live in.
No!
No!
Why would we want to live here?
Why?
We got to go home or we'll die.
We're not going to die, honey.
- We're not going to die.
- There are bad things here.
There are bad people, people that got you in trouble.
There are temptations.
- Those days are over.
- No.
- Sweetheart, those days are over.
- No.
It's okay.
Listen, Bill.
You don't have to cut a deal with Roman just to get us back.
We're okay.
We're fine here.
Joey, I can't.
I can't have you all here.
I love you, I do.
But I can't have you.
I can't stick you in a flophouse or some shelter.
I can't do that either.
I'm just completely at the end of my rope.
Okay, let's go.
Listen, you mind driving?
My eyes are playing me up.
Doctor says it's stress.
It's okay.
Listen to me.
He's about to cave.
He's about to give in.
Now it's none of my business, but if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't settle with him right now.
I think you can get a better deal later.
Thank you, brother Frank.
You're welcome, brother Roman.
Can I come home now?
You and your precious wives are welcome back at any time that pleases you, brother Frank.
Thank you.
And Roman, God bless you.
God bless you.
Damn them.
We've been stood up.
Let's just get out of here, Bill.
Let's go by mom's first.
I want to pick up some of her stuff.
What do you want here?
This is our mother's house.
Sorry, not anymore.
Property's been reassigned.
We've been assigned to live here.
Well, you better leave.
It's ours now, like I said.
You better take it up with the UEB.
UEB can't just take away your house!
Joey, take it easy.
Earl?
What are you doing?
Earl, stop that now.
Come on.
Come inside.
Let's just go home.
Nah, not yet.
The condo building you see behind me caught fire last night when a faulty electrical wire burned through its protective casing, sparking flames that started a fire in the basement.
Barb, can I come in?
Of course you can.
How are things in your house?
Fine.
Yours?
Is that all you want to know?
I want to ask you something.
I don't want any details.
I don't want any information.
Just one question and I'll never, ever mention it again.
Is it over?
Yes.
Thank you, Barb.
He sleeps in back.
Okay, you wait here.
- Bill, I'm coming--
- No.
Just me and him.
Keep watch.
Roman Grant?
Who is it?
What?
Get out of here.
You stood me up.
You get out of here.
This is our bedroom!
Leave us be.
- Help, help!
Someone's broken in!
- No, hey hey hey.
Help!
Bill?
What are you doing?
How dare you?
How dare you?
An old man and 14 defenseless women?
Leave us be, Adaleen.
All we have to do is scream and a fate will befall you that you will not wish to contemplate.
Get him!
His privates!
Get his privates!
Stop it or I'll kill him!
Now, leave us be.
You're making a big mistake, son.
Don't call me "son."
What you did to my family was wrong, Roman.
Now I'm prepared to do business.
Not on Easter.
All right, what's your proposition?
I'll give you the 15% of the second store that we've been fighting over.
It'll be an off-the-books payment from me.
15% off the books.
Nothing on any future stores.
And my family come home to their places.
I'll think about it.
Roman, it's over.
There's no thinking left to be done.
Now you make this deal, or this guitar that you hold so dear,
truly is history.
You don't look so good.
You look worse.
I'm going to go tell mom she's going home.
All right.
Mom?
Hey, sorry to disturb you.
I just wanted to tell you--
Go.
- Ow.
- Sorry.
- You okay?
- It's okay.
What are you doing with that guitar?
I borrowed it for a bit.
Why?
Thought I'd take some lessons.
I settled with Roman.
Whoo, it's cold out.
Where's Nicki?
What?
It's Nicki's night.
You've gotta go.
Honey, what are you doing here?
It's our night.
It was.
You didn't get my message?
- See the post-it?
- Post-it?
I traded with Barb.
Could you get me the heating pad and the Midol before you go?
Ben wake up.
You gotta step on it.
We're leaving in 15.
You awake?
My machine's on the fritz.
Can you believe it, the party?
I mean, the tablecloths alone.
Should've used paper.
What do you want?
Nothing.
Give them.
No, I, I can do them later.
Benny, I have plenty of room.
Benny!
Benny, I don't feel very good right now.
And, I did have 18 brothers growing up.
Just put them in the pile and I'll bleach the heck out of them.
Don't worry, I'll take care of your sheets.
Mom, I have to work after school.
Can I borrow the car?
Hold on.
Stand still.
Hello?
Oh.
Hi, Peter.
Yes.
Today?
No-- thank you.
No problem.
I can be there.
Bye.
I got called in.
You okay?
Tired.
Oh, tough night?
Yeah, worked late.
People think having three wives is a walk in the park.
It wasn't the wives.
I couldn't sleep.
Had these dreams all night.
Oh, yeah?
I was being chased, at home, in the store, all over.
Bad dreams?
Ran into lawn and garden looking for a rake or some tool to defend myself with.
There was this, this clicking sound-- like fingernails, clicking when you drum your fingers.
Yeah?
Following me, coming closer and closer.
I can't shake it.
Are you sure it wasn't a revelation?
I don't know.
It could've been.
Lots of revelations come through dreams.
You know, Lehi received revelations through his dreams.
Mine always come in-
- I don't know-- quiet premonitions.
Did you cry?
No.
Oh, Vernie has tears streaming down her face whenever she receives testimony.
And Jojo at the market, she asks for personal revelations show her which brands like tuna in oil or in water.
And I tell her, "jeepers, the lord's not gonna hear that.
Use your own agency.
Pick whichever, as seeth you good."
Now Peg, she's something else.
She--
I uh, brought in donuts.
Saved you a jelly one.
It's on your desk.
Thanks, buddy, but I'm gonna hold off.
I think I'm gonna fast on this one for a day or so, maybe get some clarity on what this dream's all about.
Well, we're still on for tomorrow with Jason and Ben?
4:00 a.m. Stopped by Fish and Game yesterday, picked up the licenses.
Great.
Eh, oh, we're gonna need to use your car.
Uh, there was a rabid skunk in the yard last night.
I grabbed up a shotgun and I got him, but it let out a big cloud of stink, got all over the car.
Couldn't wait till tomorrow, huh?
No.
It was fun.
This is in the way.
No, no, no!
are these the rules?
- Yes.
- No, these are not the rules, Wayne!
Do we jump on the sofa, Ray?
Mommy's not feeling good, Wayne.
Do we jump up and down and yell and scream on the sofa?
- Yes.
- No, we don't.
No, we don't.
Get off now.
Off!
I'm sorry.
Mommy didn't mean to yell.
Mommy's not feeling so good.
Come on, Raymond, let's go jump on the bed.
- Hello.
- Is this Nicolette Grant?
Yes, it is.
This is Utah One Bank calling.
Yes, I'm aware I have a balance.
Then, you're aware that we haven't received a payment from you.
Yes, I know my payment is a little late.
It's just that--
Nicki!
Nicki-- hi, honey.
I've got good news.
It's some telemarketers-- always in the morning.
I got called in for the day-- an emergency.
Oh, that's-- that's good, I guess.
Oh, it's good for all of us.
You sure you don't wanna get that?
What's all this?
Teenie has a little classroom pageant at 4:00.
She needs her costume at 3:30 for tomorrow night's eclipse.
Lunar eclipse.
I'm the moon.
It's a breeze.
Just needs this hemmed, and a pair of black tights.
Here is a 20 to pick them up.
She will meet you out front of the school at 3:20.
Are you all right?
I was up all night with cramps.
- Don't you think you should get--
- No, I got it.
O kay.
- Hello?
- You hung up on me before.
No, I'm more than happy with my telephone service.
- Ms. Grant, I don't think you understand--
- Just a second.
Barb, this all fine.
No problem.
Thank you.
And if you could pick up Sarah after work...
Yes, I understand.
I'm gonna have to call you back, though.
You're making this extremely--
No prob, Barb.
Can do.
And while you're sewing...
Ben's jeans.
Gosh, that thing won't stop.
Now, go.
Scoot-scoot, I got it.
Teenie, you grab your lunch, I'll start the car.
Okay, mom. hurry.
Thanks again, bye!
She's not here!
Nicolette, is that you?
Papa?
Ding-dong.
Uh, Barb, right?
Carl... from across the street.
Of course.
Hi, Carl.
Hi.
Margene, from next door, babysits for us.
Oh, is that little fella yours, too?
He's mine.
Right.
She brings over her children when she babysits.
Oh, you know, I was actually looking for Bill.
He's at work.
He left early.
You know it's fu-- uh, the woman... two houses down-- your, your tenant, the one with the braid?
What about her?
It's nothing.
I'll talk to Bill later.
Well, he won't be back until after 6:00 tonight-- if I can help?
I'll just talk to him.
Bye bye.
He knows something.
Darn Nicki and that overblown birthday party.
Bye.
Hi.
I'm the babysitter.
Bill Henrickson.
Can I help you?
So how much?
Oh.
I don't know.
I-
- I guess about five grand.
Say, we're doing a store drawing.
You can sign up with any of our cashiers.
That's pricey.
Cheaper just to buy season tickets to the jazz, see the game in person, not on TV.
You asked for me?
Saw those ads, you in the cowboy hat.
Pretty funny.
Is there something you want?
I could get a salesperson to help you.
Don't need one.
I downloaded a consumer reports thing on TVs.
I'm actually looking for this particular one.
Oh?
Let's take a look.
Pursuant to the underlying agreement, the U.E.B. has the right to audit your books-- all of them.
That's a demand letter from our lawyer.
Consider yourself served.
Who the heck are you?
I work for the prophet.
Have a nice day.
Is there any reason why?
She got called in.
She's teaching today.
And nobody answers at Nicki's.
I'm so glad you called me, Lois.
I didn't call you.
I thought this was Sarah's number.
Uh, she's at school.
I've wanted to talk to you since the party.
Just have Bill call me.
Tell him it's important.
I don't really think we got off on the right foot.
I feel you don't approve of me, like you don't like me.
And I think if you'll just give me a chance, we can become friends.
I want you to like me, okay?
Okay?
Margie!
- What kind of emergency?
- A family emergency.
So you need to finish Teenie's costume.
It's a snap.
Patch Ben's jeans.
Watch the boys.
Boys, hush.
Feel like I'm forgetting something.
Well, I'll be back in time to help you with dinner.
I can't sew.
And I'm doing this aerobics thing.
I gotta get this baby weight off.
Boys!
Wayne I mean it.
You were gonna take my boys.
It's an emergency, Margie.
You need to deliver Teenie's costume to the front of the school by 3:30 sharp, and pick up some black tights on the way to go with it.
Thanks so much, you're the best.
Bye, boys.
B ye.
Sorry to eat in front of you.
It doesn't bother me.
Told you you can't trust Roman.
he's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
I don't trust him.
I just know we need to be patient.
Once he gets it that he can't intimidate me he'll move on to easier prey.
Tell that to that kitchen supply company in moab.
- It was failing and Roman torched it.
- Come on, Don.
- Arson.
- It was never proven!
Gus Dalton... he was in business with Juniper Creek.
He falls out his office window.
You don't know that.
His wife said suicide, said it was the antidepressants and sued the company.
I don't know how we can break ground on another store with him still in the picture.
If his association with us becomes public, that's it, we're cooked.
I'm telling you, he's gonna go away, trust me.
I hope it's soon.
This corner isn't gonna stay on the market long.
Hi.
Hi, what are you doing?
Counting cars.
What's up?
Um, now that the store's open, do you think
I could get an advance on next month's allowance?
Nope, and if there were a way, you'd need to talk to Barb.
She got called in.
Didn't she tell you?
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
Bill, you give her too much power.
Nicki, we all have our responsibilities.
I still think you give her too much power.
Honey, you gotta talk to Barb.
That's that.
Don't say a word.
That's five minutes.
Oh, fudge.
Lost count.
Two weeks.
That's how long the average butterfly lives.
That's sad.
Well, not for the butterflies.
They're too busy.
Courting and mating and laying eggs.
Do butterflies go to heaven?
Gosh.
I don't know.
I hope so.
If they're good, they should go.
Do they have to be baptized?
My dad says you have to be baptized to go to the celestial kingdom.
Everybody, look at your papers.
One minute.
I'll be right back.
Daddy.
Nicki.
Come in, hon.
Do you have thorough and complete checkups?
Good, you must have thorough and complete checkups.
The gift of the gospel lived is health.
Thank you, sister.
Come over here, honey, and sit down where I can see you.
Now, honey, you know I don't like being surprised.
I can explain everything.
It was just a little mistake.
See, Raymond had the chickenpox and I was so worried when I was writing the bills that I got confused and I accidentally sent the credit card check to the electric company.
And, they called me, but the card company called you 'cause you co-signed.
And it's all just a mistake.
Well, I co-signed for $500, and uh, according to this, you now owe 6,000.
Well, it's all right.
To err is to be human.
Does Bill know?
Absolutely.
Of course.
Well, good.
But it does make me feel bad for him.
No man likes to have another person come between him and his wife.
If I were Bill, I might resent me.
Let's remove me as cosigner.
Don't you think?
What are you doing?
We'll just give Bill a call.
I don't want him thinking of me as a meddling old father-in-law.
Let's just tidy things up.
No, papa-- don't.
Now this is for half.
There might be a way to pay off the rest at the end of the month.
How's Bill's new store going?
He doesn't talk to me about business.
Well, why don't we ask him about it?
If Bill were to throw you out, you know you can always come back home.
Okay?
I'd like some more juice now, please.
Yes.
Bill Henrickson, my brother, big chief.
Hey!
Look at you.
How you doing?
What's up, Joey?
- Nice to see you.
- Wanda.
- What are you doing?
- Uh, this and that.
- Can you stay for lunch?
- No, we gotta be somewhere.
Let me give you the tour.
Anything you want, you can have it for cost.
How's everything?
- We're great.
- Super.
Sit, sit.
Uh, just wanted to stop by for a sec.
We're doing stuff.
Yeah, all fancy.
Yeah, it's a-- a speaking thing, kind of a presentation.
Where?
What?
We're trying to run a nice, respectable fish farm, and Roman's making him go off to the old folks' home.
Wanda, no one makes me do anything.
Making him brag about all his football stuff-- weaver state, Dallas, sign autographs.
And then get the old people to invest in these worthless ranches out in the desert.
And it makes me sick.
And it makes you sick, too.
Well, honey, Roman knows a bit more about it than we do.
And it's not-
- I don't mind.
Wanda, why don't you go take a look around the store and see if there's uh, something for the baby.
He's making Joey get theld people to trust them first, and then write big checks.
And a bunch of them are suing and want their money back.
I'd want my money back, too.
It's nothing I was involved in.
It was one of the first ranches.
This is my first time.
And the lawsuit's put a real scare into Roman.
That true?
Yeah, he stands up in meetings, pleads with people for money to help fight off the suit.
What happened to all those investigations?
ATF was after him.
They brought in some hotshot lawyer from Denver, said there weren't any guns.
Anyway, even if there were, it was perfectly legal.
Um, anyway.
Say, you know I gave Benny my Super Bowl ring at the party.
That was real generous.
It'll mean more to him than it did to me.
The thing is, I need to borrow it back.
Just for a couple times.
I need to show it off, you know?
The old people like it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no...
Keys, keys, keys!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Shoot!
Oh, my watch.
Boys, we're leaving!
Please, please, please, please, please, please...
No!
Yes.
Oh, fuck!
Now I just think the whole pledge thing is weird.
So were you still regular LDS when you took the pledge?
Nope.
So how'd you become a polygamist, anyway?
Mm-hmm, not me.
I'm just along for the ride.
Okay, so your parents, I mean.
I don't know.
Come on.
Mom got cancer and almost died.
Dad just started... believing in the principle again, I guess, and-- and, next thing you know, he married Nicki.
But how could your mom say yes to that?
Her version or mine?
Her version, she just-- you know, started believing in the principle, too.
And, mine-- she loves my dad too much and she's just afraid of losing him.
Must've been weird.
So I can get my mom's car, and then I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Okay.
- Is this your house?
- Uh, no.
I live next door.
I was trying to tell the woman on the phone I wasn't a criminal, but she didn't believe me.
Do I look like a criminal to you?
You never know.
Oh, what's your name?
Tui.
Tui?
Hi.
I'm Margene.
Uh, could I get you to disarm the system on that house two doors down because I think I locked my keys inside.
No, I can't do that.
Then I need you to drive me somewhere.
Fast.
- Hi, Mrs. Henrickson.
- Hello.
Probably due to the weather.
8%.
Listen, I gotta call you back.
Yeah, yeah, call me after lunch.
Hey, what are you doing here?
What's going on?
I had a break and I had to tell you.
They want me to fill in for an entire maternity leave, a full six weeks through the end of the school year!
That is terrific.
Six weeks!
I mean, in theory, it's full-time.
I'm not certified full-time, but they're giving it to me anyway.
I'm so proud of you.
Oh...
Have you run it by Nicki and Margene yet?
No.
No, I wanted to tell you first.
Well, I think you better talk to them.
- Why?
Do they have veto power?
- Of course not.
Just, what you do affects them, and I don't wanna--
Well, I know it affects them.
I just thought you'd be pleased.
I am pleased.
But I wanna make sure everyone else is too.
It's--
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Bill, Mr. Williams is here to see you.
Gee, I've got a meeting with a Westinghouse rep.
Go.
I'm kind of tied up, but--
That's-- that's great news, honey.
Can you step on it a little bit, Tui?
No, I can't do that, m'am.
Speed limit's 25 in residential.
It's harassment-- plain and simple.
Yeah, probably.
Babcock, Price Coggins.
Just letterhead, but it sends a message.
Well, that's comforting.
Like that kind of clicking?
Yeah, following me.
Could've been a big old hand.
People do have those dreams.
So what-- what's the bottom line?
They have a right to audit.
Both stores?
The language of the original contract, which we did not draft.
It's pretty clear.
They have a right to an audit at a time and a place of their choosing.
Great, just great.
Well, I need to think.
Hate to tell you.
Not much to think about.
Not on this one.
Well, I need to think anyway.
You'd never guess an old reprobate like Roman Grant would go high-end corporate counsel.
I'm impressed.
Teenie, I'm here.
Everything is gonna be just fine.
- I got your costume.
- I need tights, Margie.
- I need tights.
- I know.
But everything got crazy and I couldn't stop.
- So these'll work.
- What is it?
It's pantyhose.
Come on.
Come get in the car.
I'll put them on you.
Come on.
Tui, scoot over a little bit?
It's two number three's, a large iced tea and a frosty freeze.
It's 9.90 at the next window.
You know, a couple West Jordan players came after the game last night.
They were gonna come back after closing.
Yeah, they won't.
You're a whore.
They smelled it on you.
So sad, "Bang-Bang."
Why don't you go have another strawberry shake?
Here's your fries.
Thank you.
So are you coming to that party with me on saturday?
No, actually she's not.
We're actually gonna go--
Not you.
Don't know.
Nothing like watching a whore scramble for her eternal damnation.
So hot.
Maybe we'll go, Heather and I.
To the same party as her?
No way.
You don't wanna go, either.
So let's go to the Spaghetti Factory.
They opened a new one at Trolly Square.
Or we could go boy-hunting with Donna.
Why not?
Not a hard choice.
Come on, let's go to the spaghetti factory.
I don't know.
Might be fun.
The party's up at the university.
You know, you could get a latte and go wild, Bang-Bang.
You know what?
I've upped my standards.
So up yours.
So perfect.
Thought you didn't wanna go?
Changed my mind.
May I take your order?
Generally, the three heavenly bodies stay in their own orbits, but...
Once in a while something very special happens.
Once in a great while, like tomorrow night, there is a lunar eclipse.
Look, it's a full moon.
You know I don't know how to sew.
She gave me like Ben's jeans and she gave me this--
Teenie's devastated, completely heartbroken.
What happened?
Shouldn't we ask you that?
How's the family emergency going?
Yeah, somebody die at The Gap?
I had to see my father.
No, Nicki.
Nicki, I wanna know why you had enough time to go shopping but not enough time to take care of your responsibilities here.
Now, Teenie was prancing around in a pair of old pantyhose.
I don't know a thing about that.
It was so simple, Nicki-- just finish the costume and get a pair of tights.
Something came up.
I don't know why it was my responsibility to make a moon suit.
I made Margie responsible because something important came up, just like you've done to me a hundred times.
Margie doesn't know how to take care of these little things.
Right.
Of course not because I'm just the babysitter.
That is not what I meant.
You know, I don't have to answer to you, Barb.
I have important responsibilities in the world, too.
No, and while we're at it, everyone in the neighborhood is asking questions about us.
Never mind, I get it.
No, I don't think you do, Nicki.
The party was a fiasco.
It called attention to us at a time when discretion is the most important value we hold.
From here on out, no one comes to these houses in prairie outfits.
- "Outfits?"
- Period.
Oh, you have no authority to make that rule, Barbara.
How about this?
How about, we all get to make rules?
My rule is, first wives don't get to run off constantly taking jobs on a whim and shove their responsibilities onto second wives anymore.
Well, if we all get to make rules, then here's my rule:
second wives can't sleep with third wives' husbands in third wives' own bedrooms!
Oh, would you stop harping on that?
Just get over it.
All right.
Let's all calm down.
This is not in the spirit of who we are.
Come on.
Hands.
Barb, I just can't right now-- maybe later.
I need to take some Midol.
All right, then.
Later.
Tell him I don't mind, dad.
You're a good boy, Benny.
Never kick a man when he's down.
I cannot bear what Roman's doing to Joey-- a front man, dressed up and sent out like a trained monkey.
- Roman says "dance," and he dances.
- Honey.
Nothing you can do about it.
At the end of the day, everyone has to live by their own decisions.
Any chance Joey has of getting free, any chance he has of getting on his feet...
Dinner in five.
Do you think something bad is gonna happen tomorrow, daddy?
No.
Why, sweetie?
The eclipse.
She's been studying about it.
It's a bad omen.
I think tomorrow's gonna be a great day.
Hey, dress warm.
Still see some snow up there.
Just what we need, more venison.
I'm not gonna shoot anything.
Tomorrow's Ben's day.
Right, son?
Yeah, I can't wait.
Benny, could you get me some ketchup from the pantry?
Oh, I was going to tell you.
I'm afraid the neighbor Carl, across the street, suspects something.
Uh, he called me at the office.
He just wants permission to repaint the house number on the curb in front of Nicki's.
Some kind of-- fundraising project.
No way!
30-ought-six!
Thank you so much!
A 30--
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Watch where you aim that thing.
Thanks, dad.
Hey, remember tomorrow-- no deodorant, no soap and no mouthwash.
Like you really have to tell him that.
Hey, Nick.
Just wanted to see if you were feeling any better.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were so quiet at dinner.
Thanks for noticing.
Hey, come on.
You're my rock.
Margene said you saw your father today.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
He just called me.
About what?
He was sick.
He asked about you.
- Asked about the new store.
- What'd you tell him?
The truth-- that you don't talk to me about the business.
Look, I didn't mean to upset you.
Bill, you're my husband.
Come on, I would never do anything to hurt you.
Heavenly father, we thank you for this beautiful day.
Ask that you bless Ben's new rifle and make it shoot straight and true.
And bless the deer-- may its death be quick and painless.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Amen.
Gentlemen.
Yes, sir.
This is Don, this is Don.
Come in, Bill.
Bill to Don, Bill to Don.
Reading you loud and clear, partner.
Let's go.
Good luck.
- Have fun.
- Let's go, Jace.
And I know you should never take out a second mortgage to pay off your credit card debts.
All right, now, that you've got right.
I think I have to file for bankruptcy but those laws just changed, right?
All right.
Listen, Nicki-- you really, really gotta help me out here.
Let's deal with this.
How much credit card debt do you actually have?
I don't know-- around... $20,000, I think.
You think?
How much?
Maybe-- maybe 30,000.
Nicki, here is the bottom line-- when you don't know for sure how much credit card debt you have, that says to me probably somebody else doesn't know, either.
Now, you are married.
Don't tell me that you are hiding this debt not only from yourself but from your husband as well.
Am I right?
Yes.
Do you understand that he is legally responsible for this debt?
So don't you think you owe it to him to tell him how much debt you have?
But that's why I was calling.
See, I wanna know what I can do so he never has to know.
No-no, no-no-no.
Truth attracts money, but lies repel it.
You are never going to be able to get the money you need to pay off this debt if you continue to lie, not only to yourself but to your husband.
People first, then money, then things.
I say it all the time.
And by the way, Nicki, will you just get a grip on how much credit card debt you actually have?
I don't know, Nicki.
I'm not happy with you.
You're up next on the Suze Orman show.
Hi.
Uh, am I on?
Mom, I'm going to a party tonight, okay?
What kind of party?
Just regular.
Well, then leave me the regular information-- where, when, phone number, and be home at 11:30.
You're gonna miss all the pots and pans.
What?
Uh, the chinese used to bang pots and pans to scare off the demons trying to devour the earth, according to Teenie.
I have a question.
Teenie, go get your costume.
Did it take you like, days or months to get used to the idea of polygamy when dad brought it up?
It was a gradual process.
Why?
I don't know, I was just thinking.
How did Roman take over the compound?
How did he get in control?
Roman was your great grandfather Orville's accountant.
And after the raids in the 1950s,
Orville set up the U.E.B. and Roman manipulated the shares.
I don't really understand how, but he tricked Orville and was able to vote him out.
It was like a hostile takeover.
Roman took Orville's land and most of his wives and left your dad's family poor as dirt.
Wait, Sarah?
I want you to remember that we are not those people and we never will be, if that's what this is all about.
I have been over to Nicki's three times in the last two hours and she won't come out of the bathroom.
She wouldn't answer me, either.
How's your girlfriend?
She's okay.
I mean, I really like her.
It's confusing.
I've been having weird dreams.
No kidding?
How do you know if God's talking to you, or if you're just talking to yourself?
It's one of the most important challenges in life, Ben-- to learn to hear, recognize the voice of the lord.
Staying wholesome's part of it-- so many addictions in this world--
TV and food and gluttony.
Things that are offensive and numbing to the spirit.
But you also have to be very careful.
Sometimes, you think it's the lord speaking and it's just your own emotions, your own demons.
Can anyone have a revelation?
Well, we all have the potential to receive testimony, Ben.
In dreams?
Dreams--
Mr. H., Mr. H., uh, a wolf-- holy macaroni.
Dad-- daddy went back to get the pie and I was-
- I was peeing and I saw a wolf!
He was running up a hill.
He's not gonna hurt you, son.
Just leave it alone, it'll leave you alone.
Rule of the wild.
Snakes, bears, wolves-- they're all the same.
Just give them a wide berth and they'll head off on their own.
Gee thanks, Mr. H.
Are you all right in there?
Nicki?
Nicki, Margene and I are worried.
Could you come out now?
Nicki, please open the door.
- Nicki please, this is really--
- Your children need you!
Nicki, just come out of there.
Nicki!
I am about to call 911.
If you're all right, then you better open up this door right now!
Margene, please.
All I wanted was a little privacy.
Guess that's too much to ask, for Pete's sake.
We were concerned about you.
You have been in the nastiest mood since you got your period.
Oh really?
Maybe I'm just mad at you, Barb.
Did you ever think-- what?
When were you gonna tell us about your new job offer?
After you took it?
Huh, boss lady?
Please, stop calling me that.
Margene, distract them.
Please, please.
If you and I could have a rational conversation, I--
I'm rational now.
And my answer is "no."
- You cannot take that job.
- That is not your decision.
Wait a minute.
What job?
I'm not your personal assistant, Barb.
And neither is Margie.
I did nothing that we haven't done 100 times before.
The money goes into a common pot.
That is not the point.
You can't make decisions that affect us without consulting us first.
Right, Margie?
We're equals.
Please stop it, you two.
Equals?
You treat Margene like she's your maid!
I got her a stereo.
Where did you get the money for that?
Money, money, money-
- That's all anyone ever thinks about around here.
Then, you won't care that you won't get an advance on next month's allowance.
Just stop it!
I hate this.
First, it's your classes at the university two nights a week, then it's weekends with the cancer society in Beehive village.
- Now, it's a full-time job?
- Six weeks.
You are being so spiteful.
I am taking the job, and that's that.
What job?
Shoot!
Dang!
Did you see him?
I can't believe I missed him.
How could I--
Take it easy.
You have to have patience.
The hunt's not just the kill.
It's about waiting, planning, then deciding when to act.
You'll get him next time.
Here-- here, drink that.
Hot, hot.
Do you wanna dance?
The night is young.
Oh, this is gonna be great.
More, more.
Don't you wanna get all gushy?
I wanna dance.
Oh, god.
It's those guys, those guys from West Jordan.
Come on, come on.
Forget it, I'm not into picking up someone.
Well, I am.
Here, you finish it.
Mom, it's starting.
Have you talked to Nicki?
Hmm, I have nothing to say to her.
What are these for?
To bang and scare the dragon away.
Donna.
Let's go.
How come?
'Cause I don't feel good, and everybody's leaving, and you drove, and you're a mess.
- What, is this your mother?
- No, she's not my mother.
Just a few more minutes.
What are you doing here?
Satan's whore inside?
I guess.
Came to see if you needed a ride home.
I do.
Sit up.
Sorry.
Okay.
Oh, I don't feel good.
Cough syrup.
What size?
Eight ounce.
Two of them, though.
Thanks for coming.
You have to promise me something.
Okay.
Donna goes to Mercer so I don't--
I don't care what she knows.
You... can never tell a soul about my family.
Okay.
As far as you know, I have one father and one mother.
Okay?
Yeah.
I mean ever.
No, I got it.
Okay, okay.
Shut up!
I'm going after Roman.
I'm gonna take it to him.
Bill?
Did you see the eclipse?
We made so much noise we scared the dragon away.
We saved the king.
We saved the world.
Are you coming in soon?
In a minute.
It's Nicki's night.
I know.
I'm glad you're home.
Things go a little haywire when you're not here.
Sweet dreams.
You awake?
Sarah?
Sarah, you need to get dressed.
I just got called in.
I'm gonna have to drop you and Ben with Teenie McAllister.
- Then we have to walk.
- Honey, just hurry.
- Wake Ben up.
- I'm awake.
Oh, good morning.
And remind Teenie that today is honey bees.
And just grab some fruit and yogurt from the 'fridge, please.
Okay.
Ouch!
Lester, don't-- Don't bite.
Don't bite.
- Hello.
- Hi, mom, how are you?
- H-O-T.
You been out yet?
- No.
My ac went on the frit last night.
Landlord's so cheap.
What's up?
I was wondering what you were doing this afternoon, cause I thought once the kids were down,
- you and I could watch a video.
- Margene, honey, I can't today.
Got a date with Mick at 4:00.
You remember him.
You met him.
Coco, shush!
Coco, Coco!
Honey, I gotta go.
The dog's going crazy!
Coco!
Morning, Bill.
- Got that cash flow report?
- Sure, right here.
- Has the bank called?
- Not yet.
- Morning, Jackie.
Hey, Chuck.
- Thanks for coming in.
- Hey, there he is.
All cued up and ready to rock and roll.
Well, let's take a look.
Bill Henrickson here inviting you to the grand opening of our new Henrickson Home Plus, this saturday.
We got plumbing to barbeques, bathtubs to drywall, faucets to French doors.
We have it here.
Serving the Wasatch Valley with a hometown difference, now from our second location in Pioneer Plaza.
Now where are my cowhands?
I don't know about the cowboy hat.
You think the cowboy hat's too much?
You kidding?
The cowboy hat's great.
Good job.
Yeah, the cinnamon and the grey.
It doesn't matter.
- Uh, the grey then, large.
- I'm gonna get out now.
- Oops, I gotta run.
- Mother!
- So you have everything, right?
- Mother.
Yeah, overnight's fine.
Okay, it's fine.
Okay, bye.
- We're done now, mother.
- Let's get you dried off.
Just a sec!
Oh, boy, you know who that is?
- UPS.
- You're so clever!
Beautiful.
Look.
You have 16 new messages.
Dad, Dad, okay, you're not gonna believe this, but I'm starting at third base.
Coach chose me from the bench, I'm a starter.
Guys, wait up.
Dad, I gotta go.
I'll tell you all about it tonight.
I did it.
I'm a starter.
I love you, dad.
Way to go, Benny.
Hi, daddy.
I can't get mommy on her cell.
And Nicki, well, you know...
You have to bring me home some grubs.
Rex won't eat the pinkies.
He hasn't eaten in three days.
- I think he's dying.
- Grubs.
Thank you, daddy.
Have a nice day.
Marge?
What?
I wanted to wear something nice for dinner, but I'm still too fat, so none of my clothes fit.
Come here.
Put this on.
Come on.
Wayne.
This is a present from mother.
Be happy, Margene.
No... really?
You've been dying for a good sound system for the house.
If Bill asks, don't tell him it's from me.
And better not mention it to boss lady.
Hi, hon, it's me, Barb.
Listen, I got called in last minute.
Math.
They had me teaching math.
If that's not a joke, I don't know what is.
So I think dinner's gonna be a little late.
I'm not gonna have time to pick up your suits from the dry cleaners.
And Benny's tryout went really well.
He's a starter.
Isn't that something?
End of messages.
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetheart.
- 10 more minutes on the meatloaf.
- Sounds good.
- You were bad this morning.
- I made sure no one was looking.
- Daddy.
- Hey, buddy boy.
Whoo!
- Where's your mom?
- Hi, hon.
There you are.
- Hello there.
- Hi, honey.
- Ben, Sarah, dinner!
- Taste it.
Tater salad.
- Mmm!
- Yeah?
That's ready, and so are those extra tater tots in the oven.
- Can you get 'em out?
- Sure.
- Oh, this looks great.
- Our dear Father in heaven, we present ourselves unto thee and offer thanks for blessings bestowed.
We offer thanks for this fine warm weather.
Please bless us with good health and a successful store opening.
And bless dear Benny with success as a varsity third-base starter for the Cumorah Cougars.
Though our trials are great, please bless us all as your loving family.
Sealed together through time and all eternity.
Amen.
Had to catch 'em and field 'em in to the first baseman one at a time.
I told you that baseball play would come in handy.
Yeah, it did.
Margene, could you pass me that?
Lester's on parade.
Lester's on parade.
I think somebody's got stinky pants.
- Pleasant dreams.
- Don't forget.
I won't.
Say good night.
Boo!
Ah... boo!
- Good night.
- Good night.
I did it at school.
Look at this painting.
I did it myself.
Good night.
I want some after you, Sarah.
She's still fixated on those last few pounds.
It's so superficial and immature.
That's what happens.
- We have babies.
- Hey, Ben, come here.
I missed you so much.
Sometimes three days can feel like such an eternity.
And I hate it when family dinner falls on our night.
Do you think I'm dirty-minded 'cause I think of you so much?
Honey, I miss you too.
If I don't say so, it's cause I don't want Nicki and Barb to feel like I miss them any less.
So does that mean you miss me more?
Officially...
I miss you guys all the same.
Oh, gosh, after the store opens, I wish that we could just go away together for a few days...
- Yeah.
- And leave everyone behind.
And sleep in.
- Yeah.
- Oh, please, just sleep in.
Let's do it this way.
My boobs are really sore.
It's Aaron.
He'll stop.
- Just relax, baby.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Shh.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yeah.
- It's not me, is it, Bill?
- No.
No, of course not.
It's not me, either.
It's-
- I don't know.
It's the store, the stress.
Okay.
Mom, can I have raisins for school?
Get them yourself.
- Ben, what's that stuff?
- Steroids.
- Protein powder.
- Teenie.
What are you thinking?
- What?
- You've completely outgrown this jumper.
It barely covers your rump.
Go change.
Morning, forgot to get milk.
All we have is skim-- Not my idea.
Wayne, what a handsome shirt.
It's Land's End.
Sweetie, you still have all your tags and stickers on it.
Here comes dad.
Hey, Don.
Hey, heads up.
Yeah, I just got a call from the lawyer.
He said he could squeeze us in at 11:00.
Great, see you in a bit.
- Hey, dad, what's up?
- Hey, Benny boy.
Honey.
- Are my black shoes upstairs?
- Did you leave them here?
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Nicki, I'm late.
Dad, dad, quick question.
- I need another gun.
- What's wrong with your shotgun?
A rifle.
Big stuff, deer, elk.
- Mom.
- Come on out to the car.
Sarah.
I have to get my stuff.
- Benny.
- Thanks, dad.
- Come on.
What were you two talking about?
- Mom, come on, we're late.
Did you get my message yesterday?
- Hon, I gave you all I could spare.
- $100?
Isn't there at least $500 you could slip into my--
No, come on, you know things are tight until the new store opens.
Barb re-upholstered all her chairs when we moved in here.
- Barb's been working, too.
- Well, that's not fair.We're living united order, just like Juniper Creek.
Everything into the common pot.
You know that.
You don't need to redecorate, at least not right now.
You told me to.
- And I told the lady at the store--
- Nicki, how many times?
You know what we're carrying?
Three houses, for Pete's sakes.
You're the only one I gave a personal checking account to.
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling.
- I gotta go.
I'll see what I can do.
- When?
Don't push it.
I'll call you later.
Promise?
Daddy.
All right, next month, it's Nicki the 1st, Margie the 2nd, me the 3rd, Nicki the 4th,
Margie the 5th and so on.
Margie, your birthday is the 21st...
Which is mine, but I'll give you Bill for the night.
We could trade.
Oh, sweetheart, that just makes it more confusing.
You take him both nights.
- I don't mind.
- Thanks.
What about Wayne's birthday?
He turns five on the 17th.
Oh, my heck.
That's right.
I can't believe it.
Well, he should be with his father on his birthday.
Well, it looks like the 17th is family home evening anyway.
Yeah, but I want Bill to be with Wayne at our house all night, though.
You don't mind, Margie, do you?
Oh, no, I don't mind at all, not at all.
You got a problem with it, boss lady?
I get him an extra night anyway, so...
Well...
Whatever works for you two is fine.
Here's household cash.
It's a little short...
Again, but we'll manage.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nicki, I mean, do you have something to say?
I mean, this isn't just about logistics.
It's the spirit of openness that makes us a family.
I know.
It's just so tight, is all.
Boys!
We told you to play quiet.
Wayne, take ray into the other room and stick that fish movie in the vcr.
Nicki.
You don't mind me using the last of your skippy, do you, Barb?
We're fresh out at my house.
Here, as ceo of Henrickson home plus one corp., granting franchise and loan-out of trademarks and logos to Henrickson home plus two corp.
Here, as sole shareholder for home plus two, authorizing payment of the franchise fee to home plus one,
and president of home plus one.
Hang on.
Just sign here acknowledging receipt of the $100,000 franchise fee from home plus two.
- Yeah, Bill here.
- Hey, hello.
Bill?
Wanda?
Bill?
- Hey, hello, Bill?
- Hang on a sec, will you?
Bill, are you still there?
Don't you hang up on me.
I wouldn't be calling unless this wasn't an emergency.
- How'd you get this number?
- Nicki gave it to me.
Let me guess.
Joey's in trouble again.
No, your brother's fine.
It's your daddy, he's all sick, and Joey doesn't even know I'm calling you.
He'd kill me if he knew I was calling you behind his back.
I don't understand why Joey can't deal with this, you see?
Your mother doesn't want anyone else involved, you see?
Okay, fine.
All right.
This is not a good time for me.
I can't talk just now.
I'm busy.
Bill, well, I'm busy too.
Joey and me are having another baby.
We're married now and I'm just trying to do right by your family.
Your mom's acting crazy, Joey doesn't know what to do about it and none of us are allowed to call you.
Then don't.
Tell Joey to take some responsibility for a change.
I don't have time for his junk, and you can tell him I said that.
Dumb-head.
- That's it.
Congratulations.
- Super.
- Don.
- Lee.
- See you at the store, partner.
- All right, buddy.
I think you're gonna be very happy with your curtains.
The fiber is unbelievable.
The sun can't fade it, and it's machine washable, plus it has a 10-year guarantee.
Oh.
No, this card is definitely not going through.
Is there another account you'd like to use?
That dang card company.
Yeah, let's try... 9998-8812... 1316-2219.
- And the expiration is 3-07.
- Okay.
You know, I'm really glad we decided to go with the liners, too.
People think you can skip liners with swags, but you really can't.
Oh, there.
All's well. $3,696.
Perfect.
So I'll return those swatches when you come for installation.
That's fine.
So we'll see you on the 18th then.
Okay, bye-Bye.
This new store brings 80 new jobs to the Wasatch Valley.
I can't be happier.
I was hired just a week before being laid off from my old job.
My wife's worked for home plus for five years.
Henrickson's a great company.
You'll just have to wait until saturday...
Nice piece.
Oh, pajamas?
- New?
- No.
I thought I'd wear 'em for a change.
You look very handsome in them.
- Yeah?
- Mm-Hmm.
Kinda sexy.
Did you hear the Dillons across the street finally sold their house?
Mm-Hmm, maybe it was some big, bad mormon bishop who's trying to snuff us out.
I don't know.
- Barb.
- Mmm?
I want you to sign your check over to me when it comes in, so I can put it in the family account, just this once.
We all need to pull together.
Things will be better once the new store opens.
What?
What are you looking at me like...
Because I resent it when you just tell me what to do, and you don't ask.
- No, you know I do.
You know I do.
- Honey.
- And I resent it that Nicki put you up to this.
- Oh, just leave her out.
- Nicki has nothing to do with this.
- If she could just...
If she could just ask me outright...
I'd... [(I don't...?
)]
We need the money, is all.
Just do as I ask, will you?
- No.
No, you mean do as you say.
- Yes.
Are you gonna wear pajamas to bed every night
Or just on mine?
- Hello.
- Were you awake?
- Joey?
- Yeah.
It's the middle of the night.
I thought I told you not to call me like this.
Listen, it's dad.
That's why I'm calling, okay?
He's really sick.
I don't even know if he's gonna make it.
It's not the emphysema.
Mom's in denial about it or something.
Look, Bill, I wouldn't call if it wasn't bad, all right?
This isn't how I wanted to get back in touch with you.
What's wrong with him?
He's throwing up blood.
Right now he's in like a coma or something.
He's got a lot of pain, too.
He just...
He needs to see a doctor, Bill.
Mom wouldn't listen.
And I thought maybe with you she would.
Hello?
Bill?
Bill, it's really bad.
All right, okay, fine.
I'll come up in the morning, sometime after 10:00.
- 10:00, I'll be here.
- Yeah.
Bye.
- Where is he?
- Back at the compound.
- Dad's sick.
- What's wrong with him?
Mom won't take him to the doctor-- The usual.
Well, maybe he'll just drop dead.
Don't go.
Don't do it.
Once you open that door, it's...
Do you have a class tomorrow?
Oh, Bill.
No.
No, when we swore that we would never go back out there,
I really meant it.
I can't.
No, I ca-
- Hmm-Mm.
I just can't do it.
The seediness, the corruption, old men preying on young, helpless girls.
Prophets?
Try con artists, all of them, I swear.
Then why are you going with him?
'Cause he asked.
He's got too much on his plate already.
Now this, and your Uncle Joey to boot.
I can't let him go alone with Nicki.
All the emotional demands she makes on him, you know how she upsets him.
Margene's gonna be taking care of Wayne and Raymond while we're gone.
See if you can help her out with everything after you get off work.
Why can't we just hire a babysitter like everybody else?
Because we're not everyone else.
Barb, don't take this the wrong way, but--
Nicki, please.
Let's not get into anything unpleasant.
I'm just saying, you don't have to come.
The fact is, you can make things so uncomfortable.
You don't like anyone.
You don't try to fit in at all.
You just scowl.
Well, admit it.
You do.
You make it hard on everybody else.
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine once we get there.
- How about your sunglasses, honey?
- Thanks.
I think what we need is some Lynn Anderson.
Sounds good.
Buckle up.
Oh, hey, Don, did you get my message?
Yeah.
What time are you heading to Salt Lake?
Yeah, when'd they call?
Say again?
Okay, yeah.
- Look.
- Hi, Nicki!
That's Lois's son.
Well well well.
There you are.
Look at this hair.
I was gonna wash it,
- But I knew there wouldn't be time to dry--
- You look great.
You look great.
Barb.
Oh.
Sarah wrote me the nicest letter last month.
Did you bring the children?
- No.
- Oh, just look at you.
- No, Lois, they have school.
- Of course they do, Barb.
Look at that Windshield.
How can you see out of it?
- I'll wash it.
- Hey, mom, where's Gumbo?
He's... around.
I don't know where he went to.
Just chasing rabbits.
Oh, you are such a sight for sore eyes.
- Where's dad?
- Inside.
- Joey said he's sick.
- He is.
Oh!
Nicki!
I haven't seen you in a while.
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Dad.
Dad?
Oh, good lord.
He's better today.
He's gonna be fine.
I don't know why everyone's so up in arms.
Don't let me die.
He fell off the couch.
I couldn't lift him back.
Where's joey?
He and Wanda got their own place, next to the Walker's.
Don't you lay into him.
and I mean it.
I put fresh sheets on all the beds, in Bill's old room and out back.
You can work out your own sleeping arrangements.
Lois...
We're not staying the night.
- He's gotta get to a doctor.
- No!
Remember when he got his fingers caught in the fan?
- You said doctors, and he was fine.
- He needed 23 stitches!
- Bill, there's blood in his mouth.
- No, no doctors.
- They only draw attention to us.
- We know one in the city.
It's an hour from here.
He's discreet.
- Park memorial.
- Not a hospital!
You go in, you never get out.
Tests and more tests and finding new problems.
No!
Absolutely not!
And I mean it!
Wanna help me get him on the couch?
Mr. Woodcock says you guys got two more minutes.
Man, that name.
You closing tonight, Plygie?
Yeah.
Is that diet or regular?
- Regular.
- Can I have a sip?
We're Marona's Congregation.
We fight sin and all temptation.
Beating satan's our salvation.
Yay.
Oh, here comes that new girl.
Total Morg.
So I was with my boyfriend last night.
We were at first base heading to second, and he goes, "what's that smell?"
- It was me, like a vat of fries.
- Oh, don't you hate that?
Can I sit with you guys?
Yeah.
- So did you do second?
- Mm-Hmm.
Third?
How third?
I let him finger me.
- Donna, gross!
- What?
I'm not a morbot.
You know, life is too short to eat white bread and jell-o for the rest of my life.
I think that chastity takes courage.
I don't think it's such a bad idea to get past your hormones and not screw every penis that will allow you to mount it.
I mean, who really wants to get pregnant or std or something?
Your mommy would be proud of you.
You mean "mommies."
Oh my god, Sarah has three mommies.
Back to the grease pit.
She won't let Roberta or any of the other wives near him.
"And I mean it."
It's like a nervous tic at the end of half her sentences.
"No doctors.
And I mean it."
She's taking the early shift at the gas station tomorrow.
And that's when we'll take him in.
Whether she likes it or not.
Good.
Shh, shh!
Aaron.
Aaron, please.
Shh, Lester.
Shh.
Wayne, no!
Ray!
Ray!
Oh!
Shh, shh!
No!
- Hello.
- Hi, Marge, it's Barb.
- Hi.
- How's everything going?
Everything is okay.
I have everything under control.
Well, that's good to hear.
- Frank.
- So when are you coming home?
Well, things are a little bit up in the air here.
It looks like we're gonna be staying over the night.
- Can you hear me?
- I can't hear you.
Who's that crying?
- No, he's not crying.
- Tell her Wayne needs to be in bed by 8:00 or she'll be up all night.
- I don't want to overwhelm her.
- I'm just trying to help.
No, that's unacceptable.
You tell me there's no way I'm opening up without a test run.
- You're breaking up.
- Barb, I cannot hear you!
Tell them if they wanna get paid, well, they'd better find a way to do it.
Nicki says that Wayne needs to be in bed by 8:00 or there'll be heck to pay.
Honey, are you sure you're all right?
Barb, when will you be home?
I'm going up the road to see my folks.
I'll stay there tonight.
You better come by and pay your respects to my father.
- Nicki, I got my hands full here.
- Are you sure you're okay?
We'll be fine.
We'll be okay.
Everything is under control.
If you can hear me, call me if you need anything.
- Wait!
Wait!
Stop running!
- Bye-Bye.
Rhonda.
Do you feel okay?
You sure?
Well well well.
- Bill.
- Hello, Roman, Alby.
- You remember Rhonda?
- Yeah, sure.
And look at this.
Look who we got here.
Sister Lois.
Frank still feeling poorly?
Harleen sent over another batch of this stuff.
Tell him to drink it, tell him I said so.
Come on, sister Rhonda.
I got some mint tea on the stove.
We've missed you up here, Bill.
We've had some tremendous growth.
4,000 attended sacrament last week.
And did you know, we even hired a P.R. Firm since the olympics?
Us with a P.R. Firm.
Can you beat that?
- I sure can't.
- They're consultants.
P.R. Consultants, papa.
And you're opening another store, I understand.
- Very soon.
- I've called you several times.
- Five, six-
- How many, Alby?
- Eight, papa.
Eight?
You remember Lee incorporated us five years ago.
He sent the papers out to you yesterday.
We're a little late filing, but it's all squared away now.
Oh, wonderful.
So we got no problem then.
- Totally squared away.
- I'm glad.
Mighty glad.
So what kind of music are you into?
Let me help.
I like jazz.
I like linkin park.
I can't help it.
I really like Bobby McFerrin.
You know when I'm 21,
I really wanna go on a mission, and I wish I could go to an islamic country because I think post-9/11, that part of the world needs our help the most, don't you think?
I think the whole world needs help.
See, I like you, Sarah.
You're thoughtful, right-minded... not all boy-Crazy or screwed up.
So what about your family?
Pretty average, I guess.
They involved in any church activities?
They used to be.
They're pretty busy now.
Dad's a businessman.
Mom's a teacher.
Well, she's a substitute.
She's taking classes to be full-time accredited.
And my uncle Joey used to play for the nfl.
- He used to play for Dallas.
- Wow.
That's really cool.
So what about you?
Are you in young women's?
- Mia maids, Laurels?
- No, hmm-Mm.
What ward are you in?
I'm not really into church these days.
I mean, I like their positions, their take on morals and honesty, but...
So you're inactive.
I'm just trying to figure out what makes sense to me.
Oh.
No, I get it.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you give me your phone number and I can call you sometime next week
- and we can hang out?
- Okay.
- I mean, if you want to.
- No.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
So what do your parents do?
My mother is a homemaker.
And she served as Y.W. Counselor at our old ward.
She's pretty active in relief society.
She's really great.
And my dad, he's a state trooper.
Rhonda?
Did Sarah come too?
No.
No, she couldn't.
Why?
She has school.
Oh.
You can't have any more babies?
No, honey, I had cancer.
When?
Six years ago.
I had a hysterectomy.
Is that when you said Bill could marry Nicki?
Well...
There's a little more to it than that, sweetie.
I'm married to the prophet now.
Oh, Rhonda!
No!
They used to be regular married, but didn't live the principle So god wouldn't bless her with anymore babies.
They took her to the hospital, but... they still couldn't fix her.
I'm never gonna get cancer.
It's too hot.
I want it with milk.
We need a toxicology.
- It's gorgeous, mama.
- For my birthday.
Sisterwives all chipped in and got it for my collection.
Everybody knows how much I love Lladro.
I know, they're so beautiful.
- Why don't you take a couple?
- Papa, can I...?
What?
No, nothing.
What have you gone and done now, Nicki?
Papa...
What is it, honey, hmm?
- What's wrong?
- It's just so hard.
They don't know what they're doing.
Margene, from some hick town in Colorado-- She doesn't have a clue.
Barb, she's so...
Everything's so superficial, like fixing up your house and your car, and...
I don't want to go back.
Nicolette, hush.
You're married now and to a good man, and you just have to accept the life that god chose for you.
You just have to grow up and... stop being such a dreamer.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
What are you doing to him?
Stop!
Mom, mom, mom-- It's okay.
You-
- How dare you defy me!
- Mom, I'm not defying you.
- I have some rights.
- Yes yes, I know.
- You can't treat me like some old car ready for the scrap heap.
- I'm taking him home!
- Mom, now please, no.
He's really sick.
Yes, he has arsenic poisoning.
Oh, Frank!
Frank, I'm gonna get you out of here.
I want him out.
I want him home and I mean it.
Mother, mother, listen to me !
He's full of arsenic!
He has to stay here.
- Arsenic?
- Yes.
Now the hospital is supposed to report it to the state, to the poison control board so they can investigate.
It's okay.
Our doctor's agreed not to tell anyone, but he has got to stay here and be treated.
Oh, dear lord.
Do you know if he's been near any pesticides?
Have there-
- Have there been any feuds going on with the wives or any other clan stuff I should know about?
Easy.
Easy easy, it's okay.
It's okay.
We're here.
What a nightmare, that place.
Little Rhonda?
What is she 14, 15?
Married off to Roman.
What if it were Sarah?
Joey with Wanda,
Trying to stay clean in the middle of all that craziness, it's just...
638 00:46:28,394 -- 00:46:30,369 Barb, I know.
I know, but I wish you'd just leave them be.
I was under the impression we felt the same way about it.
Well, we do, but I wish you'd lay off and quit picking at 'em.
They're not us and we're not them, okay?
Can't we just leave it at that?
And dang it, I wish you'd just give me that check.
You make it sound like I'm asking for the grand canyon.
I gotta go by the store.
- Eagle gas.
- It's Bill.
I wasn't sure you'd be there.
- You got back okay?
- I'm not incompetent.
So mom, do you have any idea, any idea at all how dad got exposed to the arsenic?
I'm putting in a new water tank and having the hand-pump tested.
Oh, I don't know.
But there's something I want to say to you.
We're sealed as family for eternity.
You can't just waltz in and out whenever it suits you.
Who knows when your brother will have a spell and get hopped up and go sailing off the deep end again?
You're the only two I have left.
I know that, mom.
There's something else I wanna tell you.
Now listen to me.
No one will ever care for you like your real family.
You better learn that now or you will regret it, wind up all alone.
You better remember where you come from.
You better remember who you are.
I got a car out front.
Margene!
Honey!
Honey, what is it?
What's the matter?
I try to contribute and I try to do my part, and I just can't get it-- I can't get it right.
I can't do enough.
I can hardly take care of my boys,
- Let alone Nicki's.
- It's all right.
I am a total fuckup.
- I can't measure up to you or Nicki.
- You don't have to measure up.
You just-- Just be yourself.
That's enough.
I can't please Bill.
I'm sure you do.
I'm just not any good at this.
I don't think it's always easy for anyone.
We're not trapped.
We're all here by choice.
We've chosen to be a family.
I am trapped.
I have two babies, and I am such a crummy mother.
Boss lady's right, Marge.
It's not easy.
None of it's easy.
I gave your wife a ride back.
You and I need to talk.
Roman, Alby.
Now, what were you thinking, Bill?
That I wouldn't read these, or that I wouldn't understand them if I did?
- Now, Roman, this is different.
- We staked you.
We have 15% of the store-- Both stores, as I see it.
No, this store is another legal entity.
- It's separate.
- Separate?
That's false, papa.
You're entitled to 15% of the first store, which you receive.
This store's a franchise.
So you're entitled to 15% of the franchise fee
- it pays to the first store.
- And who owns the franchise?
You can put it any way you want, Bill.
Have your attorneys arrange it any way you please, but we get 15% of anything you do.
Listen to me, son-- Carefully.
There's man's law and there's god's law.
And I think you know what side I'm on.
I'm sorry...
That's not the way I see it.
Alby.
Cumorah Cougar marching band!
How about giving 'em a big round of applause?
They sound great.
C'mon, what do you say we cut that dang ribbon?
It's not because you asked.
It's because I wanted to.
I need some sleep, Bill.
I think mom's trying to poison dad.
Ow!
All right.
Come on.
Barb's house.
Meeting.
Now!
Did you hear her rototilling at 6:00 in the morning?
It's like a giant cavity being filled in the backyard.
And when she's finished with her section, she wants to do ours.
Incoming.
Okay.
That much close to the grass--
No more dirt in diapers.
- Morning, Margie.
- Morning.
Clogs, please.
All right.
Lee Hatcher sent over the wills to sign.
- Oh, do we have to?
- Yes, we have to.
The one I have now says Cindy gets custody of my children.
And until you sign yours, your children will go to whomever the law decides.
We have no choice.
So this is where we are.
It's a, uh, my-death-plus-two formula.
If one of us dies, the kids go to Bill.
If one of us dies and Bill dies, kids follow the rule and go to second wife;
with the exception of second wife-- meaning you, Nicki--
If you die and Bill dies, you can't give your kids to second wife, because that's you, and you're already dead, so you pass yours on to first wife, me.
Got it?
Me, Bill-
- Nicki.
You, Bill-
- Nicki.
Nicki, Bill-- you, on account of Nicki already being dead.
See?
Simple simple.
Well, if anything happens, I know the kids will be taken care of.
This is a big day for us.
We've come a long way together.
I am so proud of us.
Not that many people are this lucky.
All right, just sign yours and give them to Bill, and he'll put them in the safety deposit box.
I am happy.
I love you both so much.
You're overheated.
Put on a hat.
Hey, has my guest, Bill Henrickson, arrived yet?
- Yes, he's sitting over there.
- Ah, yes.
Stuart, how are you?
Please, don't get up.
Good to see you.
- Hey, Stu.
- How are you?
- Uh, Bill Henrickson.
- Mr. Kimball.
- Uh, Stuart, please.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh, I haven't been here very long.
- Please, sit sit sit.
- Thank you.
I was uh, delighted that you accepted my invitation.
I've been looking forward to this for some time.
- Good morning, Mr. Kimball.
- Hi, Tammy.
Would you bring us two juices, please?
Of course.
Well, uh, you play?
Golf?
Uh...
Well, my wife and I used to play.
I'm more the hunter-fisherman type.
Oh, thank you, Tammy.
We'll order in a minute.
Okay.
So, Bill, um... do you know why I asked you to meet me?
No, sir, I really don't.
Bill, I am the chairman of recruitment for the Salt Lake Leadership League.
We're a group of businessmen who come together to promote the city and the state.
Oh, I'm very well-versed in the league, sir.
I-
- I'm an admirer.
You're not just a business network, you're true public benefactors.
Well, thank you.
And we're impressed with you, too.
We would like to invite you to be a member, and I would like to be your sponsor.
You'll have to excuse me, sir.
I'm-
- I'm--
I'm very flattered.
I'm honored.
I just wonder if-- if I've got the time.
I'm-- well, my business is in its infancy.
Nurturing it to where it wants to be is-- well, it's-- it's a-- it's a full-time job.
Well, we don't invite many candidates to the table, Bill.
I don't-
- I don't quite know what to say.
I'll tell you what:
don't say anything for the moment.
Let's get to know each other, and then we'll see where we stand, hmm?
Fair enough.
- Good morning, Mr. Henrickson.
- Morning.
There's an Ernest Holloway here to see you.
He insisted.
He's over in housewares.
Thank you, Wendy.
Those are all the shares I've been issued, going back to 1962.
We talked about you at the UEB meeting yesterday.
They joked for over a half an hour-- all the ways they'd like to see you gone.
They also talked about negotiating a contract with Nasa to sell clay from one of the mines we own in moab for the heat shields on the shuttle.
They don't believe we even went to the moon, yet they're in business with the agency that didn't go there.
I'll take these UEB shares to my lawyer for an opinion and see whether you can sell them and whether I can buy them.
How much do you think those things are worth, huh?
I don't know.
We'll have to figure out some valuation process.
Thank you, Ernest.
Thank you.
You have no idea how this information helps me.
Rhonda's coming this afternoon.
- Coming here?
- Mm-hmm.
For how long?
Spring break.
She's representing Juniper Creek in a drama competition at the U.
- Where is she staying?
- Sarah.
With Nicki.
It's easy to sit around and pass judgment.
It's more difficult and more meaningful to love someone.
Mom, I spent the entire afternoon with her at Wayne's birthday party.
She's like from another world.
And I think she stole my iPod.
Well, maybe the week she spends with us will have a positive effect.
Let her see how a normal, healthy family can live.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on.
Ben, Brynn's on the phone.
Tell her I'll call her back.
You want me to lie again?
No, thank you.
You do your own dirty work.
Sarah, come on.
Brynn, can he call you back?
Everything okay?
I don't want to talk to her right now.
Why?
I think maybe we're moving too fast.
Does that sound stupid?
Not at all.
Hold back, Benny.
Please hold back.
You'll regret it if you don't.
I wish I'd been as smart as you.
I don't know if I'm that smart.
You are.
I wasn't.
It was just some boy from the apartments next door.
You're lucky.
You were taught it's something sacred.
Yeah, it is.
Barb, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, honey, close that door.
That fertilizer smell is lethal.
Sorry.
Oh, sorry.
So...
I love what you said this morning--
I loved it-- about how far we've come, but can I have my kids go to you instead of Nicki?
Margie, why would you say that?
We love Nicki.
Well, she's a wonderful mother.
Oh, it's not about her being bad, it's just-- you're so good and--
I mean it.
Lester and Aaron reach for you before they reach for me.
I think that's more important than anything.
They should go to you.
It's what I want.
Uh, well...
How are you gonna tell her?
No, I can't tell her.
That would hurt her feelings.
But maybe I could just get your permission to talk to the attorney and have it changed.
And just tell him it's confidential.
Totally confidential.
You wanted to see me about your will?
Yes.
Mmm, Barb is a wonderful woman, a wonderful mother.
We're very close.
But I can't leave my children to her.
In the event of my death and Bill's death,
I'd like my children to go to my parents at Juniper Creek.
So remove Barb from your will?
Stuart Kimball?
I mean--
He's a real nice guy, Don, real nice.
Product recall on a sink?
Honey, uh, Bill met with, uh, Stuart Kimball.
He's been invited to join the Leadership League.
Dream come true.
Guys, do you know what this means?
First member says, "I want to lay fiber optic cable along the front."
Second member says, "I've got a bank.
I'll lend you the money for it."
Or a third member says, "I wanna build a 20-story hotel."
And the fourth member says, "I'll sell you the materials."
And the fifth member says, "No, thanks.
You're a polygamist."
And nobody lives happily ever after.
Come on.
We spend our whole lives tap dancing.
This is just one more "for instance."
The League is a swarm of LDS.
We juggle.
You've been in rotary for how many years?
Long time.
Peg, you've been chairperson of PEO for how long?
I resigned.
I see the bigger picture.
We provide decent jobs for decent people, and I'm proud of that.
But I wanna be more than-- than just a store, and the League makes that possible.
Someday, I'd like to give grants, support institutions, award scholarships.
Look at that McDonald's widow.
Look at Paul Newman.
Peg's become a purist.
She will not voluntarily belong to any organization that does not accept us.
Don, this could be huge.
- Mrs. Henrickson?
- Yes.
I'm Wendell Peller, the photographer from "The Tribune."
For the mother-of-the-year layout?
Oh, good night.
I am so sorry.
I completely forgot.
Well, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Come in, come in.
Well, we'll just have to do catch-as-catch-can.
Where do you want us?
Maybe in the front yard?
Actually, no.
Inside's better.
The kitchen's good.
That's where most families really live.
This way?
No, here.
We live in the dining room.
It's a bit formal, but it's who we are.
It's a-- awfully big table.
We do a lot of hobbies here-- model ships, planes, cars, uh, puzzles.
Busy, you know?
Tancy, why don't you go up and get Ben and Sarah?
Okay.
May I offer you something to drink?
So you volunteer at American Cancer Society and Hospice?
Yes.
Hey, who are these little guys?
This is my neighbor Nicki.
And these are her sons, Wayne and Raymond.
- Well, hi there.
- Hello.
Uh, we came by to borrow some hot dogs.
In the meat drawer.
Aren't we going to be in the picture, Barbara?
Oh, this is just for family, little guy.
Okay.
All right, let's have a nice big smile.
Here we go.
- How long has this been going on?
- I don't know.
This is this morning.
That judas.
Yeah, that's enough.
Get it out of here.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Hi, it's nice to meet you.
Um, it's what I said on the phone, I need to change my will.
I'd like to change it from Nicki to Barb-- who gets my children.
Uh, Lee, judge Winslow's clerk is on the phone.
Could you excuse me a moment?
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you earlier.
I have that new will for you.
Wow!
That's fast.
Um, uh...
Oh, hmm, no, this isn't right.
Uh, I want to leave them to Barb, not take them from her.
Wait.
I'm not Nicki, I'm Margie.
The compound?
Yes.
I want my kids to go to my mother.
Why?
Why would you do that?
It's this place.
It's the bad values.
Um, not your bad values.
You have fine values most of the time.
It's the culture here.
Culture?
!
The disrespect, the loose morals.
I want my children raised in an environment where God isn't under attack, where God hasn't been taken out of the schools, where the ten commandments are shown in public.
We agreed that all the kids would stay together.
So if I die and Bill dies and you get my children, and then you die, then all the kids go to the compound?
It's what I want.
Well, it's not what I want.
Let's just agree to disagree.
Nicki, I do not want the kids to go to the compound!
All the kids?
Or just your kids?
Any kids, and certainly not mine.
And mine include yours.
Lee Hatcher, please.
Lee, Barb Henrickson.
I need another will sent over, to me.
Yes, and and please just leave it blank who I'm leaving Ben, Sarah and Tancy too.
No, I'll-
- I'll fill it out later.
Yes.
All right, thank you.
- All right, you too.
Bye.
- Hurry up, Wayne.
Barb, you're gonna leave me out of this, right, Barb?
"Values"?
Oh, the compound is a cesspool.
No need to bring me into it, right?
Now, I mean, there is no way-- ugh-- on God's green earth that I am gonna give my children--
No reason for Nicki to know that I changed mine, right?
Hey, Lee.
Thanks for squeezing me in.
No problem.
Have a seat.
Uh, I hope I'm not out of bounds.
Are you kidding?
What is it?
Your wives.
Every one of them's come by to change her will.
It's a revolving door out there.
The post-mortem placement of a child's an important thing, but help me out.
I'm going a little nutso here.
- I'll deal with it.
- You're sure?
Piece o'cake.
Now, more importantly...
Well, your aged friend is free to sell these stocks.
These shares predate any reissued buybacks and any UEB first refusal, so he's free to sell, you're free to buy.
And this gets me his seat on the UEB council?
You buy Holloway's shares-- his seat inures to you.
As your attorney-- why are you doing this, may I ask?
It's business.
As your friend-- baloney.
- I know what I'm doing.
- I'd recommend you don't do it.
As your client, I recommend you figure out how the heck we're gonna put some value on all these.
Well, valuation on the worth of a piece of the UEB trust--
It's gonna take time-- couple months.
Fine.
No rush.
Hey.
Why haven't you called back?
Are you mad at me?
- No.
- Then what's the matter?
Nothing.
I just needed to take a run.
You're not gonna turn into one of those creeps who don't call, are you?
You know I'd never do that.
- Look, I'm all sweaty.
- I don't care.
Is that Ben?
And that must be Brynn.
What do we do?
This.
Nicki!
Stop it.
Stop it, stop it.
This is why mothers shouldn't work.
We don't work.
- Barb should be at home.
- We're at home.
Hi.
Uh, we told your mom we'd pick you up.
She had tons of papers to grade.
Oh.
Uh, well, okay...
Everybody, this is Brynn.
Hi.
I'm Lucy.
This is Ethel.
These are my neighbors.
So where can we take you, Brynn?
Um, Sandy Points Drive off South State.
Thanks.
- Sorry about the sod.
- Oh, that's okay.
Watch out for grubs.
I like your skirt.
Target?
Um, Gap.
So you know Ben's mom and dad?
- They're super nice.
- Depending.
I haven't met them yet.
Oh, we know.
But I'd like to.
You should introduce them, Benny.
Yes, you should.
Hi, honey.
How was your run?
Fine.
Thanks for the ride, Margie.
So we met Brynn.
You did?
Hmm, yeah.
And she wants to meet you.
Well, I've set it up three different times with Ben, and every time he's weaseled out of it, so--
Oh, he's probably afraid for you to meet her.
They were kissing behind the track.
Really kissing.
So did you say something to him about it?
No.
I'm not sure we share the same values on these things.
Oh, get off it, Nicki.
- I'm going.
- No, hey!
What is this really about?
All right.
If I die and Bill dies, I doubt your commitment to the principle, and that's the way I want my children raised, pure and simple.
I love your children with all my heart.
I know you do, but the reason you're able to go off and work is 'cause Margie and I are here as backstops.
I know you hate to hear this, but women are designed to tend to the chicks in the nest while men go out early to gather worms.
If women go out to gather worms, who will take care of the chicks?
Nicki, that's just not the world we live in.
Well, it's the world we should live in.
One mother can't do it alone.
It really does take a village, Barb.
Eggs give her hives, and she won't drink regular milk by itself.
It's too rich for her.
So mix it with the powdered, and use lots of ice.
- She likes it cold.
- It smells like cat.
- Do you have cats?
- No.
- I smell cat.
- She's allergic.
You should keep these in the refrigerator.
They can develop bacteria.
- Is Sarah home?
- I think so.
I'll go see.
Why don't you go upstairs and unpack?
Adaleen, uh, did you take your vitamins?
- Yes.
- 'Cause you forget.
Well, I didn't.
I don't know how you deal with her.
I love her, and we're all equals.
But last night I did dream I was trying to push her out the car door while driving along at a pretty quick clip.
Mama, we're making up our wills, and if something were to happen to Bill and I, would you be the legal guardian of my children?
Certainly not.
Your children go to your sisterwives.
You know that.
Well, I'm not sure that Barb will continue to live the principle.
- What about Marlene?
- Margene.
Not an option.
Nicolette, work it out.
Be happy.
You were always such a happy baby.
Actually, no.
That was Christa.
Anyway, enough.
I have to go.
Oh, and make sure that Rhonda's down at the university by 10:00 tomorrow morning.
I don't know how she'll do.
She's no Roma Downey.
"I have become such a liar.
I never used to lie about anything once upon a time.
Now I have to lie, especially to myself.
I've never understood anything about it, except... that one day long ago I found I could no longer call my soul my own."
- Wow.
- Mmm.
That was really good.
What play is that from?
"Long day's journey into night" by Eugene O'Neill.
He was a catholic.
It's about a family who's miserable because God's punishing them.
We read that last year, and that's not what my teacher said it was about.
Oh, yes.
Mary Tyrone, the character I'm playing, can't pray.
Satan took a hold of her.
So now she's a drug addict.
So if I win here, I'm going to Washington, DC, for the nationals.
And then I'm gonna take a bus to New York City to become a professional actress.
Really?
How are you gonna do that?
Well, I'm gonna live at a dormitory house with a lot of other girls who are actresses, and that way I'll be protected from sin.
So you're just gonna leave and not go to school?
I haven't gone to school since I was premaritally placed.
What does that mean?
I'm getting sealed in september.
As in "married"?
To the prophet.
On my birthday.
My Lord.
I love you.
Yes, you do.
And very well.
You know, you haven't said anything about the Leadership League.
Oh, it's kind of amazing.
You know, it's truly amazing.
I mean, I applied what, eight, nine years ago, got that rejection letter, and now they want me.
Well, aren't we the perfect LDS couple.
Me, mother of the year, and you on the league.
We wanted it so badly.
But do we still?
Well, I feel like we should, don't you?
Well, honey, we had temple recommends then.
We're not those people now.
Yeah, but we still live in the world.
Well, this is why we decided not to live a public life when we could help it.
It's like living a lie.
But we're always telling little lies, always.
We live a life that society doesn't accept.
I don't know which lies are good lies and which lies are bad.
It's not simple.
I don't think you know how much pressure it puts on me with Nicki and Margie-- me being out there like that.
Well, what about mother of the year?
What makes that so different?
Is that a good lie?
Beehive mother of the year is a silly little event-- one night as Cinderella at the governor's mansion and then...
It's nothing.
I thought you of all people would be happy.
Honey, I am happy, for you.
But for the family, it's complicated.
Hannah, where are the batteries?
Supposed to be in that drawer.
I can't hear without new batteries.
Neoma, those Beefsteaks are a heavy plump tomato.
I told you 100 times, they need staking.
Yes, dear.
- Paul Gannett.
- Paul!
Whoo!
Whoo!
- Debbie Valance.
- All right!
- And lastly, Teresa Murdoch.
- All right, Teresa!
Whoo-hoo!
Congratulations to everyone who's moving on to the next round.
We'd like to thank all who participated.
We're sorry not everyone can be moving on, but good luck, and hopefully, we'll see you again next year.
Yes?
There was mistake.
There must be a Rhonda Volmer on the list.
No no.
No Rhonda Volmer.
Is it because of how I'm dressed, where I'm from?
It has to be, because I'm good.
Of course not.
Every contestant is judged strictly on their merits.
As I was saying, you're all winners.
Ow!
I told her that I volunteered on Orrin Hatch's campaign.
She didn't know who he was.
So I said that he was in the senate.
And she didn't know what that was either.
So I tested her, and she's never heard of Dick Cheney or Iraq.
I asked her if she knew who George Bush was.
She said she wasn't sure, but said, "the leader?"
But how can you be surprised?
And it's not just the girls either.
When my dad got kicked out, he didn't even know that Europe existed.
She doesn't know who George Bush is, but she knows "American Idol."
And this stupid competition.
She's 15 years old and she's getting married to Roman Grant?
Hey!
I made it.
I'm moving on.
- Oh, that's so awesome.
That's so cool.
- Congratulations.
- That's incredible.
- So exciting.
He's inside, on the settee.
Who did this?
Alby and two others.
What do they know?
I don't know what they know, but they know enough!
Do they know you're transferring your UEB shares to me?
I don't know.
Hannah, go on in the kitchen.
He doesn't deserve this.
They are reassigning my wives to other husbands-- my lovely ladies.
That'll kill me.
They're coming back for Irmay at 5:00.
Two members of the council have had their eye on Irmay for a long time.
Well, you don't have to give her up just because Roman says so.
You don't have to go.
But he's the prophet.
Well, if-- if he told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?
Look, I'll-
- I'll put you all up somewhere in the city.
Somewhere where they won't look for you.
No.
Listen to me!
Listen!
I'm an old man with no income and no social security.
You've got to help me now.
You've gotta buy me out now.
They'd kill me!
Alby said they would kill me!
- Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
- He said they would.
I think we have a yard.
Sort of.
I brought you this to cool you down.
Thank you.
Marge.
If something were to happen...
I do worry about Barb and how she'd raise the kids.
And you and I have always kind of clicked, don't you think?
So I changed my will to say I want you to take my kids.
Me?
What about the compound?
Well, I've thought about it, and they really should go to my sisterwives.
And I'll take yours.
Margie?
Mm-hmm, just--
I feel really bad, but um, I'm leaving Lester and Aaron to Barb.
I know you're a really good mom and everything, and really careful, I--
I just don't-
- I just-
- I feel like you're not very warm.
I am warm.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
You can't help it.
It's not your fault.
It-
- Don't walk away.
What do you want me to do?
Gimme a hug.
No!
I hug people, but I don't hug people just to make a point.
Nicki!
I know it's a lot of money.
I know it's a rush.
Just advise me.
Would you take it into a second mortgage on one house or divide it over the three?
Yeah, I appreciate it.
Just let me know how much the bank can give, and let me know how fast you can give it.
Oh, hey, Bill.
You all set?
- You bet.
- Okay.
The guys in the pro shop are cleaning your clubs.
And, you know, I prefer to, um, carry my own bag.
It's an old habit.
That's fine.
You know, Bill, I heard you lecture a few years back.
You did?
No kidding.
Yeah, you were so passionate about your life story, your polygamist origins and how you were saved by the church.
I mean, it was truly inspirational.
Bit of ancient history, those speeches.
Well, I've never forgotten it.
What they do to those boys-- kicking them out like that.
I mean, that's a blight on mormondom.
And people think that we are them.
It's just what god put on my plate.
You know who you are, Bill?
You're the quintessential embodiment of the american dream--
The certainty that enormous opportunities are available if you work hard, no matter where you're from or who your parents are.
Would you like to say our prayers together?
I don't really do that so much anymore.
- Why?
- I-
- I just don't.
Heavenly father, thank you for this lovely day, and thank you for letting me attend this lovely tournament where I know you will help me to succeed.
Thank you for bringing me close again to my stepniece and granddaughter-in-law Sarah.
And watch over our prophet, Roman, and protect him, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
I like your friend Heather.
I wouldn't trust her, though.
I love the hum of the air conditionin.
Must be nice living here.
Who was that, honey?
Stuart Kimball.
Who's he?
Head of the Leadership League.
It's a group of businessmen downtown.
I know who they are.
I read the papers.
What's it about?
They've invited me in.
Looks like I'll be joining.
Why are you even thinking about it?
Lee, uh, told me you guys were having problems with the wills.
- No.
- No?
No.
Why are you joining?
Nicki, this is a good thing.
If it's so good, then why didn't you tell me?
It just happened.
- What's going on around here?
- What do you mean what's going on?
You out there in the leadership league, and Barb parading around on some fourth of july float as mother of the year?
What happens to me and Margie in this picture?
What happens to us as a family?
Look, Barb just got through dealing with her sister who makes her feel like you-know-what and she's completely cut off from her mother.
I understand why she needed this.
Fine, but what about you then?
Why do you need this?
My joining the League translates to putting food on our table, all of our tables.
- So it's about money?
- It's not about money.
It's about dreams.
You're putting your own desires before the welfare of your family.
This is for the welfare of my family.
Which family?
The family you had seven years ago or the family you have now?
You're gonna have to hide.
Hiding makes you half a man.
You're hypersensitive.
Being second wife is what you're upset about, and it clouds your vision and, frankly, hurts me.
What?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Heather.
I-
- I think that we have to help Rhonda.
Help her how?
There are places that we can take her.
There are place we can go--
Help the Child Brides, Justice for Children, Child Protection Project.
They can help her get away.
I can't do that.
I know that this can put you in a weird situation, but there are ways of helping that just helps and it doesn't put anyone at risk.
Um, maybe it's not what we want for her.
Maybe she has an opinion.
She's a real person...
That's being forced to be a wife to a 70-year-old man.
He's 76, I know!
Just because you're used to it doesn't make it any less shocking.
Heather, don't ask me to defend it.
It's-
- It's horrible, but I can't do anything about it.
This is not right, Sarah, and you know it.
It would put my family at risk, and I'm not gonna do that.
Mr. Henrickson?
Wendy?
Mr. Henrickson.
I came in a nute ago and, um...
I inadvertently picked up the wrong file.
Thank you.
Kimball-Collins.
How may I direct your call?
- Stuart Kimball, please.
- Who's calling?
- Bill Henrickson.
- One moment, please.
- Hello?
- Stuart, hey.
Bill, thanks for returning.
Just wanted to give you a heads up.
I had the membership application sent over to your office-- technicality, really, an opportunity for you to give a bit more information about your business and your family.
Fine, I'll keep my eye out for it.
Good.
Hey, uh, by the way, I happened to catch a documentary on TV last night about a polygamist compound.
- No kidding.
- Unbelievable.
They called it "An American Taliban"-- women as prisoners, men as tyrants.
You knew a lot of people like that?
No, Stuart, I didn't.
Do you still have family left back there?
Yes, I do.
It must weigh on you.
It does.
- Hey, mom.
- Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, you smell gamey.
Go take a shower.
Okay.
Ben, why haven't we met Brynn?
Uh, I don't know.
Just hasn't happened.
Well, let's make it happen.
I'd like to meet this person that you're spending so much time with.
It's not that much time.
Ben, no more discussions, no more excuses.
I wanna meet her.
Hi.
Can you tell me what room Rhonda Volmer would be in?
Volmer.
Volmer?
She's not in the competition.
She's not?
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
She was eliminated in the first round yesterday.
Aw, they're just at a complete impasse.
Nobody'll sign it.
Have you thought of giving them each a bracelet or something?
Zales gives you a good deal if you're buying more than one.
No, that's not gonna fly.
Listen, I need to ask you a favor.
If I die, Barb dies and Nicki dies, would you, Peg, Verna and Jojo take the kids and raise them in the principle?
We'd be honored.
Oh, I forgot.
This, uh... just came by messenger a few minutes ago for you.
Oh boy.
Formal application for the Leadership League.
You don't have to do it, you know?
No, it's the wives-- no matter how many times I try to explain it to them-- what this means, what this could mean to all of us, they just get all emotional.
They just don't understand.
They want me to say no, but I won't.
I mean, sometimes you-- you see those politicians who don't run for president to protect their pill-popping wives or their alcoholic children, and you just know that there's a hole inside of them till their dying day,
wondering just... what might have been.
True, but we've chosen a life that requires sacrifice.
You have to decide that that sacrifice is worth it.
Your charity work was important, to be sure, but, truthfully, it was your cancer that sealed the deal.
The first lady is trying to shine a light on survivorship this year.
You and your fellow finalists are all survivors.
Mmm, well, so many people are.
True, but most are merely tumors.
Luckily for you, yours had metastasized.
Just lucky.
Part of the final selection is these informal evaluations.
As a spokesperson for all the mothers in Utah, poise and presence count.
Oh, certainly, of course.
In the event you win, you are available to give speeches and make appearances?
Speeches?
Just-- uh, yes.
Are you comfortable in the public eye?
Oh, sure.
At least in front of my second-graders.
Able to attend overnight events?
I had no idea this was so demanding.
You'd be a statewide role model, very much out in public.
Very good.
I enjoyed meeting you.
Any questions-- you can reach me at the first lady's office.
And I'll see you on the big day.
Oh, I thought that interview would never end.
It's so late to start cooking chicken.
I made sloppy joes.
There's plenty.
Well, thanks.
Yeah, that-- that'd be great.
So what are we gonna do?
Nicki, I can't promise that I'd live the principle if Bill died.
I can't.
But I love you and I love those two little boys like they were my very own.
I know.
And I would certainly raise them to respect it and value those who struggle to make it work.
Do you think I'm warm?
No.
So if she dies and Bill dies and I die, then you get Lester and Aaron.
Yes.
And if she dies and Bill dies and I die, then you get Lester and Aaron.
- Margie!
- Margie!
I never thought this day would come.
I'm finally getting out.
It's hard to leave a place you've lived your whole life.
But it's a new world out there, Ernest-- a better one.
Thank you.
I don't know if you should thank me, Bill.
When Roman finds out that you've taken my seat on his council, you watch out for yourself.
I will.
What I told you about your grandfather, about his death, was the truth.
And you mind that on your journey, hmm?
Here we go.
Lend a hand.
Oh, thank you, young man.
Watch.
Watch watch watch.
Margie, you okay?
I'm sure it was just sunstroke.
I'm pregnant.
I was born into the worst kind of ignorance.
There in the shadow of a corrupt system it parades as a religion--
Polygamy.
There are kind and gentle people trapped in that system.
I was thrown out in the streets, forced to make it on my own, and I did so with the help, compassion, and the generosity of this church.
In exile I found glory--
Stuart Kimball is not available.
Stuart, Bill Henrickson.
Listen...
I'd love to join the Leadership League, but I can't right now.
I've just got too much on my plate.
I appreciate the offer.
Keep me in mind.
...and because I have a partner, not some... self-proclaimed prophet-- the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ.
I'm on a journey.
Everything I've told you here today is true.
I didn't choose it.
It happened to me.
As my journey continues, I don't know where it leads, but I walk it fearlessly.
Thank you.

FRM Team Subtitles:
Willow's Team
If we're not successful -- if we mess this up, Roman will strike back.
Blitz the quarterback, you don't get the sack, they score on you.
Yeah.
Getting in there and taking the seat is nothing.
Getting the books buys our protection.
We're gonna do it.
We'll-- we'll do it.
We strike first and we strike hard.
Look, there's other ways we could go.
We could do a proxy or-- or a voting trust.
I told you I'm in, Bill.
I'm in.
All right, this is it.
We've got a seat on the U.E.B. council.
"Got"?
What's that mean, "got"?
We now own Ernest Holloway's shares and his seat.
We who?
We you?
We us?
We us.
We've got to neutralize Roman...
And force him to control Alby.
For any of us to live in peace, you here or-- or me up in the city.
But isn't your seat just one of 12 on the board?
If we're on the board that controls his business empire, we know everything he's trying to hide.
It's a shot through the heart, and he can't retaliate.
Yeah.
I just knew this was gonna be a good day.
Savor it, mom.
For too long, we've been the flies in his web, but we're about to turn the tables.
No one knows yet, but they will.
When?
How soon?
Council meets in the city tomorrow.
Joey and I will be there.
Joey will take the seat.
Not Joey.
But-- why Joey?
Mom, my brother and I are a team.
Wanda?
Uh--
Bill's the public face of this family.
He can't be connected with the U.E.B.
And I have a family now, and-- and I refuse to live under the shadow anymore.
I've been on the sidelines long enough.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Dear heavenly Father, I haven't always been the most steadfast-- you know that.
I haven't always been as humble as...
I might have been.
But you have offered me love in spite of my failings.
You have brought the boys back together again.
Mmm, now we're cookin' with gas.
Watch over my boys... please.
Thanks.
- Barbara Henrickson?
- Yes.
Here you go.
Can you just sign right here, please?
Thanks.
You have a nice day.
Thank you.
Tickets to the event came.
- Go, mom!
- Ha ha!
How do they pick which mother would be the mother of the year?
A committee.
But I mean, why did they pick Barb?
Is she more important than you two?
Uh, no.
Well, was there something lacking in you two?
Only one person can be mother of the year.
Teenie nominated Barb, so that's how it happened.
Here.
What is it?
Breakfast.
To go.
You're irritable, Nicki.
Try to find time for a nap this afternoon.
This award-
- I just want to know when it turned into such a big deal.
When we found out it was being held at the governor's mansion.
You have to let her have this, Nicki.
Well, you must admit she's become so full of herself.
Hmm-mm.
You can't rain on her parade.
I won't.
I won't.
Don't worry.
Holloway has taken his wives and he's run.
Maybe he's on vacation.
Maybe he's having his hip replaced.
Bill is on the compound.
I know.
Inroads.
Inroads, inroads.
Papa?
Why is he so relentless?
What have we done to deserve such calumny?
Well, our settlement agreement ties our hands in making evictions.
Find other ways to contain him.
Oh, do you want to help me pick out a color to dye my shoes for the ceremony?
This is the dress I want them to match.
I'd say it's this color, don't you think?
Wouldn't this make a lovely shawl for my dress?
It is nice.
Oh my.
Oh, it's much too expensive.
It's pretty, though.
Well, it is beehive mother of the year, Barb.
You probably deserve it.
You're right.
I thought you left.
What you doin'?
Frying eggs.
For who?
One for Lester, one for Aaron, two for you.
I broke Lester's yolk, but he won't mind.
Wow.
You're in an interesting mood this mornin'.
Guess I am.
Why?
New beginnings.
You have an exam today.
I can't believe you remembered.
You're sweet.
You're pregnant.
Good mornin'.
So where is he?
I don't know.
I think you do.
Out.
Oh, look what I found.
Ooh... oh, it's--
I can only ask so many times.
You know what?
He should be home real soon.
Why don't you have a seat and wait?
Is he with Bill?
I think maybe he is.
Maybe.
I think so.
Yeah, well... brothers should be careful, because brothers can get brothers in trouble.
Call him.
I can't.
Joey has the phone.
Oh, well... use mine.
Hi, honey!
It's me.
Um, Alby's here, so you've better come home real quick.
Don't know.
I didn't ask him.
Okay.
Bye, honey.
He should be home in just a second.
Here, I've brought you something to drink while you wait.
Are you enjoying the competition so far?
It's been like a dream come true.
Have you liked seeing Nicki and visiting with us?
Yes, so much.
Rhonda, let me ask you a question:
do you miss not being in school?
Sometimes.
Sweetie, no promises now, but... would you like to stay here and finish the school year?
I don't know how we'd do it, and there's a lot of things to work out, but is that something you'd be interested in?
And to stay here with you?
Mm-hmm, yes.
Well, honey-- honey, no promises, okay?
Oh, I know that you'll make sure I can stay.
Oh, all right, let's just keep this our secret for now.
I have to talk it over with Bill first...
And Nicki.
I love you, Barb.
You really are the best mother of the year.
You're the best mother ever.
Honey, I'm home.
I have to go and meet Bill.
Wanda?
What are you doing home?
Why's Alby sleeping on our sofa?
Oh, no.
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
You promised.
Just tell me, am I too late?
Joey, he's a bad man.
He's a kook.
What'd you use, honey?
Antifreeze.
But you said he was a menace, and he is a menace.
You can't just go around trying to poison everyone who's mean to us.
It's not good!
He was threatening my family and my baby, and he's out to break you.
And I'm sorry, honey, but I'm just not gonna let that happen.
I mean, he's a sociopath or a psychopath at least.
Eagle Gas.
Ma, it's me.
Can you come over?
Nope.
I'm workin'.
Right away, ma.
I need you right away.
What is happening?
It's Wanda.
Oh, Lord.
Not again.
She poisoned Alby.
Is he dead?
No, not yet, but, uh, uh...
Bill's waitin' for me, and I gotta get and I can't leave.
Do you think you could maybe come over, mom, and be with her while I'm gone?
Oh, I don't need anyone, Joey--
No, Wanda, you do!
I asked Nicki to bring over the sewing machine.
It sure would help.
What does Nicki really think of this mother of the year thing?
- Spill it.
- She's for it.
- Margie.
- No.
I mean, she said that she thinks it's a tawdry testimonial to monogamy, but she's all for you winning.
Has she said anything to you about what she's wearing?
Hmm-mm.
Just try to try to get her to wear something a little warm.
I mean, she sticks out like a sore thumb.
O h...
Well, I-
- I know--
I don't want to hurt her feelings, but, um, it's like walking into the governor's mansion with a sign that says "practicing polygamist,"
and she'll-- she'll never listen to it coming from me.
She'll think I'm attacking her.
I mean, even just offer to do her hair.
Machine.
Thank you.
Bill!
Joey, where have you been?
I said meet me here at 2:00.
The meeting started 15 minutes ago.
I know.
I'm sorry, Bill.
I just-
- I lost track of the time.
And I got a flat tire too.
You look pale.
No, I'm just tired.
Uh, I'm nervous about this, Bill.
It's okay.
I'm nervous too.
Let's say a prayer on it.
Heavenly Father, we come to you as brothers.
We ask that you protect us and give us strength in this great undertaking.
Grant us victory against our foes, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Amen.
So, uh, the miners refused to return to the mine.
Huh.
We gave them a place to shower.
Isn't that what they want?
All this fuss over a shower?
They want medical benefits and a retirement package.
Never.
I'm through pussyfooting around.
Report them all to the I.N.S. then replace them.
What are you doing here?
Is this Ernest Holloway's seat?
Ernest Holloway has been excommunicated.
Maybe, but this is his seat or was.
It's the Henrickson seat now.
Joey.
Everything okay there?
It's true, Roman.
Copies of shares endorsed over.
We're here at your table where we rightfully belong.
Get out of here.
Get my son.
Shall we move on to beehive--
As board members, it's our responsibility to review all business and financial transactions.
You will not desecrate our sacred files.
Oh, yes, I will.
Let the record reflect that we are taking the minutes of the last few meetings so that we can be up to speed next time.
Where's Alby?
There's no answer.
Get him.
Get him now.
I can take this right now, Roman.
Or I can go get a cop and enforce our rights as shareholders.
This meeting is out of order.
Article four requires changes in membership be submitted to the executive board 10 days prior to the meeting wherein the proposed new member is seated.
That has not happened.
Meeting adjourned.
You, get out of that seat.
I'm staying, Roman.
You okay, miss Hunt?
No, Del.
I am not.
Oh gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
Someone I trusted very very much has betrayed me.
If you knew someone was an imposter, Del, and say they were pretending to be somebody they were not, hoodwinking others, and they were about to receive an honor based on false representations, wouldn't it be your responsibility to sit them down and-and talk to them?
About what?
About what they were doing.
About how misguided they were.
Isn't it your duty to help them?
Well, I suppose it is.
If I thought it was my business.
Gee-- well, I think it is your business.
That's what I think.
I mean, how could you live with yourself if you didn't try and help them?
We've got the files, we've got the computer.
He can't retaliate.
How can he retaliate?
- Hello?
- Here she is.
Mom, hey.
Calling to tell you that it went well.
We made it in and we made it back out.
And so far, safe and sound.
Well, that's wonderful.
Uh, say, could I talk to Joey for a minute, Bill?
That's it?
Just "wonderful"?
Fantastic.
Super.
Really great.
Uh, can you give me Joey?
Hi, mom.
How are you?
I'm right as rain, uh, but I'm--
I wonder what you want me to do about our little situation.
And-- and how's that goin'?
What's going on?
He's still passed out, but his breathing's quickening.
I suspect he's about to wake up, which is a big relief, but not without its own complications, so I'm wondering what you would suggest I do.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get you in trouble.
Wanda, it's okay, honey.
Just put mom back on--
- Joey, what is going on?
- It's bad.
It's real bad.
I didn't want to tell you.
I wanted to keep it from you, except now I guess you need to know, because it might affect you.
I mean, when Roman finds out about it.
I mean, if.
'Cause he might-- he might not find this out at all.
- What?
- Hello?
!
Yeah, mom, hold on a sec!
It's Wanda.
Are you telling Bill?
I-
- I don't know that I'd do that.
She poisoned Alby.
He's lying on the couch.
Big mistake.
- Alby's dead?
- No, but it's close.
Antifreeze.
Like with dad, except not arsenic.
Wanda poisoned dad?
Yeah, kinda.
But she called me.
She called me to-- to come and save him.
Well, not really.
She called you 'cause she got to feel guilty about you not having a chance to say goodbye to him.
I mean, we probably should have told you about this, Bill, and now this has happened.
I-
- I um--
Just give me the phone.
Mom.
Isn't this a dilly?
Get him to a hospital now.
I told you that it wasn't me that tried to poison your father.
But oh no, nobody believed me.
Do you know the effects of the stuff?
Wanda, do you know the effects?
Gets drunk, passes out, then it's the kidneys that go.
Gets drunk, passes out, dies.
Mom, listen to me.
You and Wanda have got to get Alby to a hospital now.
Do you hear me?
And you can't be seen doin' it.
And you've got to get rid of his car, and you can't be seen doing that, either.
Then get home and don't move.
We'll be there in a couple of hours.
It's just a cry for help.
That's what I think it is.
Mom, go now!
I accept this award on behalf of my loving husband Bill and our three children-- our three lovely children.
And on behalf of all Utah mothers who juggle schedules, work, stay up nights, give selflessly-- sometimes selfishly-- but always give--
All right...
I am mortified.
I cannot believe you just saw me doing that.
And don't assume that I think I'm gonna win, by the way.
I think it's human, Barb.
I mean, who doesn't like to win?
You're right.
You asked me to be honest, Barb, and I'm only sharing my truest, innermost feelings with you because I love you.
I know that, Nicki.
I'm thinking perhaps... you shouldn't accept this award.
I knew you felt that way, and it's not as if I don't have these misgivings myself.
You know, I think I feel more than just misgivings.
Either we are what we say we are or we're not, and you accepting this award feels like we're not what we say we are-- a family.
And that hurts me.
So what would you have me do, Nicki, in this particular situation?
What?
Pull out.
Well, I don't see how I can pull out now.
Everyone else is counting on me.
Maybe you're overestimating the importance of this event in all our lives.
Maybe.
But I don't want to pull out.
And when Teenie told me, at first I thought,
"how silly," and "of course, I can't do this."
And then I thought, "wait a minute, yes, I can."
I'm a good mother, Nicki.
And over the last few days, I realized that it's important to me to feel like I can be seen that way.
Well, what I really came to tell you is I can't go.
Now, wait one minute.
It's important to me that my family be there, that you be there, Nicki.
I have to do what I think is right.
We just found his truck.
Where?
It was parked near the landfill on Miller's Lane.
The cab was unlocked.
The keys were inside.
Well, where is he?
We don't know.
Well, did anybody see him?
No, the nearest house is a quarter mile away.
He-- he's never missed a council meeting before.
I bet he's all right.
Let me know when you find him.
No one saw anything.
No one knows anything.
Came to your house, asked about Joey, and then he left.
You got it?
No one called you, you-- you didn't come.
You know nothing.
Got it.
And no one-- no one-- deviates one iota from that story.
I need one of you three to stay on top of it.
Call the hospital and get checkups on his condition.
- Got it.
- No, not you, you.
And use the cell phone so it can't be traced.
Okay.
You gotta shape up, people.
Gotta shape up.
We've gotta hold it together, we gotta go about our business as if everything was normal.
Understand?
Questions?
Well, hello there, honey.
Hi, Adaleen.
Could you come over to the car for a moment?
Oh.
Look what you've done to your jacket.
Open the door, sweetie.
- Now, get in.
- No.
May I ask what you think your plans are?
I'm going to win the competition.
Are you?
The competition is over.
Of course, I found out.
What kind of sisterwife do you take me for?
Get in, your little Roman holiday is over.
I'm still in the competition.
Oh, you're nothing of the sort.
You can't prove it.
I don't know if you're deluded, demented or merely willfully disobedient.
Now, get in this car tout de suite!
No!
I'm through with you, Adaleen!
Rhonda!
Rhonda!
Okay, we'll see.
Oh no, you're not gettin' out of this.
You must relinquish the seat.
I'm sorry.
It's too late.
Are you an agent for someone else?
Some other group?
Someone covetous of our success?
I am my own agent, Roman.
Well, you're not displeasing me, you're throwing out a challenge to God.
You shall relinquish that seat, or I will bring your temple crashing down upon you.
No, you won't.
You've had your hands on my throat, now I've got mine on yours.
Everything on your computer I now have on discs.
If anything happens to me or my family, one copy goes to the district attorney, one to the attorney general and one to the I.R.S.
I see.
What have you done to Alby?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't believe you.
Something's happened to my son, and I know you're involved in it.
You have become a mad dog, lunging and attacking without cause.
Mad dogs must be eradicated.
Hello?
I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours.
Nicki, I've been a bit busy here.
I just wanted you to know first.
I'm not going to the Beehive mother of the year ceremony.
Of course you're going.
Why wouldn't you go?
I can't hide anymore... as a plural wife.
- Nicki.
- But she's just so prideful.
She's floating around like a big balloon.
I want you to support me on this one.
You know I can't take sides.
- Good night, Vickie.
- Night.
You've got to work this out with Barb.
If you truly love her, you'll support her in this.
Good night, Dan.
Say, have you spoken to Wanda or your mom or anyone in the last day or so?
No, why?
No reason.
I'll see you later.
Hello, sweetie.
No!
No scenes, honey.
We've packed your bags.
It's time to go now.
I'm staying here.
Everyone at home will be so glad to see you.
We've missed you terribly.
But-- uh...
Barb?
Honey, is the competition really over?
I told you what I did because I wanted to be here with you.
You said I could stay.
Sweetheart, we'll work on it.
But right now, we need to get our ducks in order.
No.
No ducks!
I know this is a blow, but we will make it work.
We will.
We just need some time to sort it out.
Sarah, Teenie, Ben!
Five minutes!
That's great, Joey.
Alby's still alive.
There's been no retribution.
No one knows anything.
We just might get out of this alive.
If we're lucky, it just might work out okay.
But if he dies, all bets are off.
Well, look at you.
You've never looked more beautiful.
Thank you.
Here, you take the tickets.
Oh... beautiful.
Thanks.
Hi!
The babysitters have landed.
Jojo, um, babysitters?
Barb, could you... close your eyes?
Okay, open.
Thank you.
Meet you there.
Thank you.
There's just two tickets left.
No, that's not right.
No, there's six.
Check in the--
Uh, it's--
Ken Byington, please.
Barbara Henrickson.
Yes, I requested six tickets and all I have are four.
But-- but they're family.
They're-- they're family from out of town.
Sisters.
Well, what do-- we do-- what do you mean, "clear"?
I-
- I can give you the names right now, and--
All right, thank you.
It's... too late.
Bill here.
Uh, Bill, um, we've got a problem here.
There's a cop here.
He's asking questions.
He's questioning Wanda.
What should we say?
What should we do?
I'll be sure to tell her, Joey.
Stick to the story.
Just stick to the story!
Uh-huh, yeah, okay.
Yes.
I would like to speak with someone about this evening's ceremony.
Correct.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Ken Byington, assistant to the first lady.
I'd like to welcome you all here tonight.
And without further ado, I would like introduce the first lady, Evelyn Linton.
We are so pleased-- honored in fact-- to have these three lovely women, women who serve both community and home, women who've survived the most difficult of trials in life, only to carry on and give selflessly back to their families
without complaint, but with valor and courage.
Now, any of these three women on this dais would make a stupendous statement, setting an example of motherhood in Utah.
But we have to choose one of them--
Uh... one moment.
Um, my husband, trying to figure out the computer.
Um, I just heard that...
What do you think you would have done if you hadn't married us?
Uh... be dating... someone.
Out of Utah for sure.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Probably Portland.
Oregon?
So shocked.
I had a friend, she opened a bakery there.
Mmm, she said it was really nice.
People rode bikes everywhere.
There was lots of water.
Said I could work the counter.
And then you met Bill?
Yeah.
How about you?
Well, I probably would have been placed with a husband from the compound.
Wow.
There was this one guy...
Gerry,
I knew him for a long time, and he was nice enough.
He was younger.
I mean, you know, 40s.
He made some kind of overture to my father about me.
You didn't want him?
Sometimes you don't get a lot of choice there.
Do you think fate brought you to Bill?
Marge, I brought me to Bill.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you mind stepping over to the side for a moment, please?
What is it?
What-- what happened?
Ma'am, excuse me.
I need to be direct.
Are you engaged in polygamy?
You have to answer the question.
Are you a polygamist?
Good heavens.
What are we gonna do?
Explain a disqualification and proceed.
What kind of disqualification?
Anything but the truth.
What's happening?
- Take her out the back way.
- Sure.
But-- but-- but... my family.
Ma'am, let's not make this any more difficult than it already is.
Please.
One of our contestants had to withdraw for personal reasons.
Um, but we send our sympathies to her, Barbara Henrickson, and... we congratulate her for making it this far.
And, uh... now, on with the program.
What's happening to my wife?
She's been disqualified.
Why?
Sir, that would be a matter for you to discuss with her... and your other wives.
This will be settled in a moment.
Thank you all for your patience.
We're leaving.
Let's go.
Let's go!
Come on.
Hello, Sarah.
We've been exposed.
I don't know how bad it is or how bad it's gonna get.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
Dad's on the phone with Don Embry.
It's not good for Home Plus.
We're goners.
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
- Where is she?
- Upstairs.
- What are you doing?
- Protecting us!
They could come for us!
They could burn us down!
No, honey.
Oh, you could be arrested, you could be taken!
Nicki, no.
Nicki!
- That doesn't happen anymore.
We're safe.
- You've got to hide!
It's okay, we're safe.
Shh...
Oh my goodness.
We're safe.
We're safe.
Shh.
Barb?
- I can't.
- Barb, please.
I can't.
I got what I deserved.
Oh, boss lady...
Welcome to the Monte Cristo.
1200 square feet.
We can do 20 tables, seating up to 200.
It is booked for an afternoon reception on the 17th, but we could have it ready by 6:00 p.m.
That works.
I have an open house from 2:00 to 4:00, so 6:00, 6:30 is exactly what I had in mind for an early sit-down supper.
That's a menu from our Pioneer Grille, voted best restaurant, best new restaurant and best brunch in the city.
I know.
Ooh, "open lasagna pumpkin"!
How many did you say?
100.
Is it possible to bring in our own entertainment?
What did you have in mind?
I haven't decided.
Either a magician or a puppy party.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You like it?
Oh, mister!
Now remember... stewardship, not consumption, is the proper relation to material wealth.
Hey, okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Look!
It's brand new.
And next time yours is on the blink, you won't have to take a loaner out while it's in the shop!
"Before you begin to study the complex interactions of the earth's physical systems, test your knowledge of a few foundation concepts.
How is the earth like a magnet?"
I don't know, Adaleen.
Where's New York City?
It's far away.
- "When is north not really north?"
- How far away?
You don't need to know that, sweetie.
"I exist because spinning metals in the earth's core create a magnetic field that surrounds the earth.
I am the 'blank' north pole."
I am trying--
I am trying to give you an education.
"I am the magnetic north pole."
Good afternoon, U.E.B. This is Adaleen.
How may I help you?
Mama, hi, it's me.
I hadn't heard from you so I was just wondering if you got the invitations.
Yes.
Will papa come?
He's awfully busy, Nicki.
I so want him to come, mama.
Oh, honey, you know, weddings, funerals, baptisms of the dead-- he's got so many things, and we must pray for the miracle of his continued health, and protect him from unnecessary tasks.
I know.
I just want us to be together is all.
Honey, what you want is immaterial.
What any of us selfishly want is immaterial.
I don't care.
I still want him to come.
Nicolette...
I'll look at his schedule and see what I can do.
I'm in the middle of a lesson.
I'll talk to you more about it anon.
Fine.
My house, too?
There's nothing even worth ripping off in my house.
All three houses.
Look, I've hired a security company and their gonna have their workmen out here tomorrow.
Do they know about us?
They don't know about our situation.
Discretion assured.
We've moved up in the world.
We have assets to protect now.
Here are the brochures.
I just want to set up a couple of perimeters of defense.
- "Perimeters of defense"?
- Just precautionary.
I've been on TV for the store in those ads.
I mean... who knows what nutcases are out there?
- I know, but it just sounds so--
- It's just common sense.
We don't want to become a target.
A target?
Who are we a target of?
No one.
Just someone, anyone.
I mean, look what happened to that Elizabeth Smart girl.
They just slit the back window and took her.
Is there something you're not telling us?
No, no, no.
If there's something going on, Bill, you should tell us.
Look, everyone, no, there's nothing.
Sometimes at night, I'm in the kitchen, there's all that glass, and it feels like someone creepy's looking in.
Last night I swear I think I heard something out back.
So did I.
- Wait, you haven't told me this.
- Whoa, calm down!
It's just a home invasion system.
There's all kinds of dangers out there.
Animals even.
I mean, a cougar coming down out of the hills...
You would want to know if there was a big cat in the yard, wouldn't you?
Some motion detectors, some seeing eyes.
Ben and I can install the floodlights in the backyard ourselves.
I just want to protect us, that's all.
Joseph Smith, unearthing the long-lost golden tablets of the ancient nephites in Palmyra, New York.
Brigham Young, our second president, leading us on our great trek into the American West.
And this guitar came across on the trek... into the beautiful Salt Lake Valley, where we as a people fought to defend polygamy.
You may take a photograph of our mural if you'd like.
You don't mind if we record?
No.
You don't mind if we do?
You see, the principle of plural marriage was God's sacred gift to us.
But in 1890, the so-called leaders in Salt Lake buckled to outside pressure and repudiated polygamy and the teachings of our beloved prophet, Joseph Smith.
We alone have kept the principle alive.
We are the one true church.
And the violence, the coercion of young girls, the abuses committed against children?
We root it out.
We crush it.
I have 31 children and 187 grandchildren, and I love every one of them.
A lot of times their mothers will say, "leave grandpa alone,"
and I'll say, "let them come to me."
Precious darlings, all of them.
And the gays, papa.
What?
The homosexuals.
Oh, the gays.
If the supreme court says yes to the privacy rights of homosexual persons, surely it's time to recognize our rights to live in peace, too.
It's Wayne's birthday on saturday and Nicki hasn't mentioned it.
Isn't that strange?
Yeah, strange.
Has she spoken to you about it?
No, not so much, not a lot.
What do you mean "not a lot"?
Not really anything.
Barb, I promised I wouldn't tell.
If I do she'll know.
But why would it be a secret?
It's just Wayne's birthday.
Mmm, I can't.
She just always knows--
Nicki...
Wayne's birthday is saturday.
I was just wondering what your plans are.
It's a secret, Barb.
A secret?
What is this with the secrets?
It's just for now.
I haven't had a chance to talk to Bill.
Oh, whoa, whoa...
Did you want something?
No.
I'll just say this:
Monte Cristo Hotel and Resort.
Hey.
Have you talked to Nicki?
- About what?
- Wayne's birthday.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.
Somebody's got to deal with it.
You or me?
No, it's okay.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Dinner's ready.
Good.
I'm hungry.
75° tomorrow in the capital city, 86° in St. George, 80° around Lake Powell.
Another gorgeous day coming up with partly cloudy to mostly sunny skies, a slight chance of showers over the higher mountains...
I'm gonna take Wayne up.
I'm pooped.
I'm gonna go to bed too.
Hold up a sec.
Tell me a bit about Wayne's birthday.
Let's talk about it after we go to bed.
I gotta lay down.
Who all you invited?
You got a list, don't you?
Yeah.
Let's see it.
Wow, a lot of names.
Now wait a minute...
Oh, don't be grouchy.
It's for Wayne.
Are you nuts?
Shh, you're gonna wake him.
Are you crazy?
How many people?
Just immediate family.
153.
- I'll trim a bit.
- Absolutely not.
No way.
This is ridiculous.
He's a little boy.
We barely moved in and you propose to parade 200 people in prairie garb and sun bonnets up and down our street?
Oh, honestly.
Of course not.
What do you take me for?
I already thought of that.
Here.
A hotel?
The Monte Cristo Hotel and Lodge?
!
What kind of money do you think we're made of?
Shh!
My father said he'd pay for it.
Your father?
Paying for my son's birthday party?
No way is your father paying.
Absolutely not!
This party will be held here, in our house-- houses, backyard, or it won't be held at all, period!
And this...
"immediate family."
Immediate family-- 10.
End of discussion!
And I'd leave your father off the list if I were you, understand?
What's wrong with you and my father?
He's not welcome in my homes.
Why?
Because I say so is why!
And I don't want you spending so much time there, always running back and forth anymore.
- But it's my family!
- I don't care!
Why are you fighting with my father?
Because we have a disagreement over our business arrangements.
- Don't try to change the subject!
- Me?
When you fight with him do you know what that does to me?
How it affects my position in this family?
- Nicki...
- Leave me alone.
Honey, you just gotta come down to earth.
You want me to lay a blessing on you?
I'll take Wayne up.
Good morning.
I can only stay for a second.
Did you hear last night?
Nicki's house?
No.
She and Bill-- big argument!
- Margie...
- What?
No, I was not spying, I swear.
I can't help it if I live in the middle.
You may not have been spying, but you're gossiping now.
Yeah, well, Bill busted her for all the overspending... and the hotel and the invitations and she cried.
Morning, Nicki.
Morning.
Barb, just wondering, might I borrow your folding chairs and card tables?
For Wayne's party.
Certainly.
They're in the garage.
Thanks.
Uh, ma'am?
Sorry, did you want a panic button downstairs as well as up?
I think upstairs is sufficient.
Ma'am, if I might, I'd like to suggest one downstairs, too.
If you're doing laundry, say, you got a bad guy in the house, he could get you, grab you, knock you senseless, out cold before you make it upstairs.
Your garage.
One minute.
I'll call you back.
Hold on.
- You got a car, you got a car...
- I got a car, I got a car...
Margie...
Margie!
Heavens!
You also have a house.
So why don't you go over there?
Because I have a daughter who's taking care of your children and who'd like to come home now.
Hello, Joey?
Hey, Bill.
Sorry, I got held up.
We just got our invitation to the party.
Thanks.
Just calling to check in on mom, how she and dad are doing.
It's weird.
He sits out in front of her cabin, won't let her out or in by the front door.
You know that small back window?
He makes her crawl through that, so she had to borrow my stepladder.
Oh, boy.
She's pretty ticked, at you.
Says you brought it all on her, left her hanging out to dry.
Says she wishes she had reached into your crib and strangled you at birth, so...
Man.
See you saturday, then.
Yeah, see you then.
Hey, Bill, Bill...
Bill.
Thanks for the invitation.
It means a lot.
Good enough.
So is she a leo?
Is she a capricorn?
Mom's birthday is june 17th.
Gemini.
She's a gemini.
What all have you told her about me?
We hadn't done a lot of talking lately.
She knows we all love you.
I just want to make a good impression.
I want her to like me.
Oh, hey, what about this?
Is this appropriate?
It's floral and pink.
Honey, you don't have to worry.
She's my mother-in-law.
I want to get off to a good start.
Mom is just--
I just don't want you to get your hopes up, that's all.
- Is that what you think?
- What?
Mr. Doom and Gloom.
- I'm gonna charm the pants off of her.
- Well...
Uh, yeah, well, you watch.
I can be pretty charming... when I want to be.
I got you, didn't I?
Hmm?
Shoot!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop!
Hey, there.
Morning.
Oh, hey, good morning.
We've been meaning to introduce ourselves.
Oh, us too.
You get so busy, you know.
Carl Martin.
Carl.
- Bill Henrickson.
Nice to meet you.
- I thought it was you.
- I just told my wife Pam...
- Hi!
...I recognized you from your commercials.
The Henrickson Home Plus, right?
Sure.
I'm an accountant with Deloitte Touche downtown.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thank you.
We're barely here ourselves.
Moved in a couple of months ago.
- My wife Barb, three kids.
- Oh, that's great.
Hey, did you have a bit of a problem with the security system last night?
- Oh, gad, I hope we didn't disturb you.
- Oh, gosh, no.
It's just those darn things.
We had one ourselves.
We disarmed it 'cause the cat kept setting it off!
The cat!
But we should get together, have dinner, or something.
- Absolutely.
Let's do it.
- Oh yeah?
- Well, nice meeting you, Carl.
- It was super to meet you too.
- And...
- Barb.
Barb, Barb.
Okay, well...
- Hello?
- We got a neighbor problem.
- Oh, dear.
- Asking questions.
- Uh-huh.
- see what you can do.
Okay.
On it.
Did he touch you?
Did he hurt you in any way?
Can I give you a ride home?
Is there someone that we can call?
Wendy?
Wendy, what is it?
What happened?
A guy came barging in--
He threatened me!
He threatened me!
Who?
Who threatened you?
He said I had to cut him a check for $22,000.
He said I had to.
He made me do it.
His eyes-- those eyes, so hateful.
Wendy, why did he say you had to cut him a check?
He made me put a notation on it.
Um, "15%, second store."
He drove one of those humvee cars, Mr. Henrickson, a yellow one.
He came racing up right onto the sidewalk, almost smashed his car right into the front of the store.
- Where was security?
- No, it just happened so fast.
Who was it, Mr. Henrickson?
What did they want?
I don't know.
Anyone get his plates?
I did.
Good job.
It's okay, Wendy.
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna find out who this was and make sure they never show up here again.
I'm okay.
I was so frightened.
Sure.
You're a brave girl.
Thank you, Mr. Henrickson.
Why don't you take the rest of the afternoon off?
The rest of you, let's get back to work.
Don, can I have a word?
Yes, sir.
- Bill--
- No.
We've just got to ride it out.
Make a clean break once and for all.
It's now or never.
They'll fold.
I know it in my bones.
Bill, I'll follow you wherever you lead, but I don't know what's goin' on here.
You have an outsider to your house.
What outsider?
The security expert, him.
I can't help it, but that's a mistake.
It exposes us.
Look what happened to the buick dealership.
Top of the world in sales till he was exposed.
Then sales dried up in six months.
I'm worried for you is all.
For all of us.
Roman'll fold.
You'll see.
It's a bluff.
Just... have faith.
Hi, I'm your neighbor, Barb Henrickson.
Well, hello.
I'm Pam Martin.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Thank you.
My husband and I live right across the street.
In that cute little green house.
No, we're in the cute little brown house.
The green is a single mother-
- Margene.
We've taken her under our wing a bit.
Bill, my husband, he helps her out whenever she needs anything.
And next to her, the blue house-- we bought it when we moved...
It was such a good deal, we couldn't turn it down-- we rent to a lovely-
- Nicki Grant is the tenant.
She has two boys.
Next to her is an elderly couple, and we haven't met them yet.
It's a quiet block.
People keep to themselves.
Is that what you asked?
Are there any extra bulbs in there?
You would think they'd fix this by now.
- Hello?
- Hello, honey, it's mother.
Hey, mama.
About this afternoon, we'll arrive around 2:00, but your father takes his tagamet at 5:00.
I give it to him with a glass of buttermilk.
Do you have buttermilk, or should we stop by and pick some up on the way?
So daddy's coming?
Yes.
Really?
I cleared his calendar for you.
Didn't he tell you?
No.
That's funny.
He was going to.
Maybe he wanted to keep it a secret.
Why would he want to keep it a secret?
A surprise.
That's it.
Act surprised now.
Okay.
- Want a pop, son?
- No, thanks.
Hey, come on.
Let's cut through Lawn and Garden.
Did I tell you the story about all this?
See, I wanted to move into Lawn and Garden with this store.
Consultant said, "No.
Not part of the strategic vision statement."
- Mr. Henrickson, good morning.
- Hi, Linda.
Heck, even our loan rep at the bank said no.
Said, "What's with this extra 20,000 square feet?"
Begged me to drop it.
"Economy's soft," he says, "not the time to diversify."
- Morning, smiley.
- Morning, Mr. H.
Nobody believed in it.
Nobody got it.
That is, nobody except your old man.
And you know what?
Lawn and Garden exceeded first month's projections more than any other department.
Vision, Benny.
From now on, you think Henrickson Home Plus, you'd better start thinking Lawn and Garden.
Here we go.
Eight final floods for the backyard and we're set.
Houses like Fort Knox.
They're coming!
Hey!
Hey!
Joey, Wanda, welcome to our new home.
- Hi.
- How you doin'?
Over there, two houses down.
- My stars.
Look at this house!
- Come on in.
The party's out back.
Any trouble finding the place?
Nicki's directions were very good.
Mom, mom, mom.
How are you doing?
Surviving.
- So this one's yours, Barb?
- Mm-hmm.
Isn't it wonderful all that Bill's accomplished?
Hello, hello.
Do I hear voices?
I'm Margene.
What a lovely jacket.
Margene.
Well, isn't she young and pretty?
You can talk to her, Lois.
Should I call you mother "H" or mother or just mom?
Lois.
Look, the ring we gave Margene.
Well, isn't that a ring?
Say, do you get "Larry King"?
Nancy Grace is on tonight.
- Hi, grandma.
- Benjamin.
Why look at you.
You look so much like my father.
Oh, you!
Rock, paper, scissors...
Just bring him around to the backyard here and you can tie him up by the pool.
Turn right on Linda Vista Lane.
How about some more punch?
- Yeah, sure.
- All right...
Can I talk to you for a second?
I told you not to invite him.
I didn't.
I didn't know he was coming.
I gave you an order.
I'm gonna clobber you.
I didn't do anything.
Who in the "H" do you think the security system's for?
Who do you think I'm trying to protect us from?
Him.
Your father.
Why can't we just be one family?
Whatever's going on, why can't you reconcile?
Blessed be the peacemaker.
Come on, please.
Just try.
Adaleen.
Hello, Bill.
So fancy.
Lovely homes, Bill.
A robust investment.
I welcome you into my homes, Roman.
Whatever our differences be, I ask that we keep them to ourselves today.
Absolutely.
There's no substitute for family, son.
Not in this life or the next.
Everybody, in "The Los Angeles Times."
"Roman Grant, prophet and patriarch of Juniper Creek, home to the second largest polygamist sect in Utah, says, 'we're just like homosexuals.'"
What did she say?
Hello, Lois.
Adaleen.
Barbara.
How's your health?
Oh, fine.
Thank you for asking.
I'm so happy to have been able to help.
Um, ex-- excuse me.
That man gives me the creeps.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Sarah.
I'm Bill Henrickson's oldest daughter.
Oh, you're all grown up now.
Yeah.
Remember Rhonda?
Yeah, of course I do.
Hey.
Hi.
Nicki, where's the birthday boy?
Barbara, did mother invite any children to my party?
I don't know, sweetie, but I'll go see.
Bill is under so much pressure.
Barb, he's my father.
I know.
I think it's a real nice party, Nicki.
I'm so glad you came.
Oh, I need some bicarb.
My stomach's a bit sour.
Whose isn't?
I would never ever tell you how to run your affairs.
She's your wife, but she's always needed a firm hand.
She takes well to a good smacking.
You, too, Barb.
Just give her a nice little swat.
It's all she'll listen to sometimes.
Isn't this fun, Wayne?
Wayne, isn't this fun?
Hi Wayne.
Are you having a good time, Wayne?
We're having a good time!
I can't stand it that Bill had to ask him for help because of me.
Well, thank god he did.
You guys have done real well, Barb.
Bill's worked hard.
He couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you.
You've sacrificed a lot.
- Hey!
- Hey.
So, your dad says you made Varsity.
Baseball.
Is that true?
Yeah, I played right field J.V. last year.
The Cougars came in second in the state.
That's great.
Did you ever play baseball, uncle Joe?
Nah.
Football was always my game.
In fact, I almost forgot.
I, uh, brought you this.
No way.
It's your Super Bowl ring!
Joey...
I always kinda wanted you to have it, that's all.
Look.
There's still a couple of the diamonds left in there.
Oh, you don't have to do this, Joey.
I love it.
Thank you so much!
"Bop." I used to get "Tiger Beat."
This is nice.
Is it for music?
Yeah, I download from Itunes, and then I burn my own CDs.
It's my collection.
I still love music and singing.
Remember when we used to play?
Yeah, I do.
We sang songs.
That was fun.
Our community center is doing a play.
We're doing "Harvey."
I'm Pooka.
My friend Lorraine is Elwood P. Dowd.
How come you stopped coming to see me?
I couldn't.
What's it like being married?
It's a pre-marriage placement.
That's what it's called now, to get around the law until I'm 16.
I wasn't forced.
The other sister-wives hate me 'cause old Roman likes me best.
Do you love him?
He's sweet to me.
The greatest freedom we have is obedience.
This guitar came all the way across the country a long time ago, Raymond.
What do you think?
Should we open your presents?
All right, everyone.
Let's open some presents.
This one first?
Timberlands!
Look!
Bass Weejuns.
Thank you, mother.
Thank you, mother.
All right, what about this one, huh?
A $50 gift card to Tower Records!
They have DVDs and videos.
Mom?
Hey, what's up?
What is it?
What's wrong?
You.
Everyone thinks it.
No one will say it.
- Hurts me to be the one.
- Say what?
You've not only taken his side, you've become just like him, just like your father.
Oh, no, mother.
Don't do this.
Not here.
I've got Roman to deal with, and you're a guest in my home.
- Come back to the party.
- I thought you'd be different.
Taking that young girl, that Margene, you call her.
I call her Margene because that's her name.
Plural marriage is a religious calling, not a license to coerce young girls--
Coerce?
Nobody has coerced anybody.
I taught you that, didn't I?
Margene chose us, not me her or we her-- she us.
We all debated it, we all considered it, and we all agreed.
Come on, everybody.
It's time to sing "happy birthday."
Darn it!
You stay put.
I'll be right back.
What is that?
It's pudding.
It's a dump truck filled with pudding!
Bill!
Bill, I need you to come down now!
Yes, yes, really.
I was in customer service at Home Plus, but people were always yelling at me.
But there's nothing wrong with the stuff.
It's just that I wasn't really good at it.
So Bill brought me home to babysit.
Babysit?
Mother, you're not listening.
But I had never known a family that works that-- that I could be a part of.
- You married the babysitter?
- No.
I wanted to be a wife.
I wanted to be a member of the family.
Uh, yes, thank you.
And thank you so much for having finally taken the time to introduce me to your new wife and my grandchildren!
Mother, we hadn't even seen each other in almost two years!
- And whose fault is that?
- It's not my fault.
Daddy, grandpa Frank's outside.
He says he won't come in, but he just wants to say hi to you, grandma.
Done?
I wasn't finished with that.
Nice party.
If that wasn't a gross display of-
- I don't know what-- vulgar materialism, cheesy and a complete slap in the face--
Yes, well, you do have your Lladro.
A collection of Lladro is not materialism.
You have no idea how difficult my life is.
No earthly idea!
- Honey...
- Nick?
Hey, Bill, you're a businessman.
This'll interest you.
- Sorry, I'll talk to you--
- No, listen.
We're stocking our fish farm, and we had a choice between trout and tilapia, and we went with trout.
- That's wonderful.
- Wait a minute.
We could have gone with crappy or bluegill, but who eats crappy around here?
Maybe they eat crappy in some place like Missouri or Arkansas.
- Fact is, I never even heard of crappy before.
- It's crop-pee.
It's pronounced crop-pee, not crappy.
He doesn't bother me one bit.
Not one little bit.
Why are you here?
I want you to admit that you did it.
Did what?
Frank, you listen to me.
I have nothing to confess, because I didn't do anything.
If I'd tried to kill ya, you'd be dead.
You didn't do anything?
Then why do you have a guilty conscience?
Cause you're sick.
Because you're a menace.
- Wrong.
- Wrong?
You came over and you shot Gummo.
- That's the reason?
- You shot my dog!
- For no good reason!
- Your dog was all stoved up.
He wouldn't have made it through the winter, and you know it.
You shot him!
Go home, go home!
You weren't invited.
You're not wanted.
Just go home, Frank!
You go home.
- No, you go home.
- I'm not goin' home.
You think for one minute those people want you in their house?
At least I was invited.
Run through the car wash while you're at it!
- Have you seen Nicki?
- She's upset, Bill.
- I know, I know--
- I think she's upstairs.
Nicki?
Honey?
- You can tell me.
- No.
Nicki.
Yes, Bill?
Some of the guests are leaving.
Come down.
You have robbed me of the tithes and offerings due to me.
And don't be trying to protect yourself, son, because there's no place to hide.
Night, y'all.
- Good night, Bill, Barb.
- Good-bye.
It was very nice to meet you all.
Hot launch programs.
I mean, here we are talking about the fact that the war in Iraq...
That's a big life he's leading now.
Baby, I don't need no house like that.
I just need you.
That's all I want, and I got you, so I'm happy.
So don't you go worrying' about it, you hear?
Hey.
Sorry it didn't turn out like you planned, hon.
No, it was fine.
We're here now.
I don't fit in anywhere.
No.
No, that's not true.
- Dad!
- Ow!
How do you turn it off?
- I want to have your baby.
- Yeah, yeah.
I want to have your baby.
Give me a boy, Bill.
Come on, give me a boy!
What do you think of the name Newel?
I think it says, "Kick me and take my lunch money."
Well, think of boy names.
We should name him after you.
We could do that.
I'll come up with a list.
Nicki.
Hi, honey.
Didn't know you were back.
He's back.
Nicki, um, my garbage disposal broke again.
What do you put down there?
Nothing.
Why do I always have to fix everything?
- Margie...
- Yeah?
Why don't you have Ben take a look at it?
But do not call a plumber.
Okay.
I gotta get back to the office.
Thanks for coming by on such short notice.
Nicki, you don'tave to thank me.
I'll call you later.
I gotta get.
Why, Lois.
Look at this.
The prodigal wife returneth.
Come back to take your rightful place with us, did ya?
Hello, Lois.
There's nothing sadder than the passing of a beloved sisterwife, is there?
What do you got there?
Cornbread.
Sweet, savory, or... strychnine?
May we converse in private?
There ought not be secrets between us, sister Lois.
You know that.
Why don't you all fix me something to eat?
No desserts and not a lot of green.
Yes, my darlin'?
Cut it out, Frank.
I've come to collect on your promise to me.
It's my time to become first wife.
I don't believe it.
You said when Roberta passed we'd be legally wed.
As second wife, I'm entitled.
It's right, it's proper, it's what's due me, and I want it.
Please.
It's a piece of paper and half an hour to the county clerk's office to make me legal.
I don't think so.
Not if you were to put a gun to my head.
And knowing you as well as I do,
I can see that as a very distinct possibility.
Frank... you are Satan himself.
Maybe you should have been a little nicer to me while you had the chance.
Hey, Lois, don't forget the old cornbread.
Don't think there's many folks here that are going to actually eat any of your biscuits.
Roman Grant, please.
Bill Henrickson.
It's me, Roman.
I'd like to sit down with you and see if we can't reach an agreement.
Enough's enough.
That's right.
I am.
Tomorrow.
Nice shot.
Listen, I'm gonna be gone for a couple of days.
Keep an eye on things for me, all right?
Where are you going?
Roberta's funeral.
Mom said you weren't going.
Well, I thought twice and changed my mind.
Roberta was good to me growing up.
Act in my place.
You're the man of the house while I'm gone.
Okay.
Help out your moms.
Watch over them.
Call me if you need anything.
Oh, and would you take a look at Margene's garbage disposal?
I think it's busted.
Sure thing.
Love you, Ben.
# Michael, row the boat ashore #
# Pull the sheet up #
# Michael, row the boat-- #
- Hey, Nicki.
- Yeah?
I'm making the schedule.
Hi sweetie.
I'm here too.
Oh, hi honey, I didn't see you.
I'm right here.
Boys, why don't you go visit with Teenie.
What about the schedule?
I thought maybe you could look at your calendar and give me an estimate of your cycle.
My "cycle" cycle?
If you have rough idea when you're ovulating
I can schedule you and Bill for those days.
Why don't we just do it like we used to-- keep to the schedule and give him to me in addition on an as-needed basis.
Well, of course, it's not an exact science, but if we could work out a ballpark guess, it'd be much more efficient.
But the chances of getting pregnant are much better if I can monitor my temperature.
I can't do that in advance.
Yes, but you only ovulate two days a month.
You're so persistent.
Sorry, I guess I'm in organizational overdrive today.
Yeah, you do that when Bill goes away.
Oh, that's not true.
I'll just leave it with you.
Get it back to me when you can, but, you know, I'll need it before next week.
So, I've been meaning to tell you...
I was wrong about Bill.
Wrong?
How?
He's not seeing a fourth.
Oh, I never thought he was.
What gave you that idea anyway?
Oh, little things.
He wasn't where he said he'd be, leaving the house at odd hours...
But it turns out I just had my signals crossed.
Well, that's easy to do.
Saying hello to my mother, if that's all right with you.
Oh my word.
What are you doing here?
Thought I'd come up to see you.
Looky here.
It's small enough so you can take it to work with you.
For heaven's sake, would you look at this?
You know, we need to look into getting you a little satellite dish.
Oh, I don't need anything fancy.
But... you drove all the way up here just to give me this?
Mostly.
I wanted to bring it to you.
I figured I'd stay with Joey and go to Roberta's funeral too.
What for?
It's the right thing to do.
Let your father walk all over her.
Never a word against him, no matter what horrible thing he did.
Just lay down and let him wipe his feet on her back.
Mother, you taught us to love her.
You'll have to set that up for me.
You just plug it in.
Ro-ber-ta.
Your father has taken this sad occasion to once more shame me and our entire family.
What now?
I wanted to finally make you and Joey and your poor sister legitimate, but he refuses to make me his legal wife.
Come on, mom.
"Come on" what?
You don't need to make me legitimate, or Joey.
And...
Maggie's gone, but she wouldn't have cared either.
Well... it's not just that.
I suppose I--
I suppose I thought I'd finally have some protection.
I don't own a thing.
This house and the gas station-- priesthood council owns it all.
I just wanted something to fall back on, but, well...
I'm just out here.
Didn't used to be that way.
I know.
Your grandfather was a great man, a true prophet.
This isn't the life that was intended for me or you or Joey.
It's okay.
I'm doing fine, ma.
I know you are.
It's the rest of us I'm worried about.
I don't know why it keeps breaking.
Did you put something down here you're not supposed to?
Like what?
Like metal?
Why would I put metal down the sink?
I don't know.
I don't think I did.
At least this time it drains, but the blades won't turn.
I don't know what to do.
Your father said we could not call a plumber.
I know.
Do you think he's a cheapskate?
Um, I believe the word is thrifty.
Is that what the word is?
Is the word "thrifty"?
- Shut up.
Shut up.
- "Thrifty, the word is thrifty."
- Don't be stupid, you moron.
- You moron!
- Give it back.
- What do you mean--
But today, take a look at how the water has pushed back.
It's not even close to us.
It's way out...
Hey, Nicki.
- Nicki.
- Yeah?
Could you take a look at Margene's garbage disposal?
I can't figure out what's wrong with it.
- Anyway, come on in.
- Yeah...
It's gonna be great once we finish fixing it up.
It just needs a bit more elbow grease.
We're gonna add on, make more room for the baby.
I think you did a real nice job.
- Here, sorry, let me get your stuff.
- Thanks.
- You'll sleep here.
- Super.
- I'm not putting you out, am I?
- No no no.
So what, you're going to see Roman while you're here?
Nah.
I just wanted to pay respects to Roberta.
Well, you know I can go with you, Bill, if you want.
No, I'm fine.
I want to be absolutely sure that you had no part in any of these land sales that are pending in the lawsuit against Roman.
I'm clean as a whistle.
Good.
Huh?
I remember these.
Just don't do anything stupid, Bill.
Okay?
Me?
I'm the smartest guy you know.
Who wants some cheesy toast?
What?
Oh, Bill.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
I came for the funeral.
Of course you did.
How nice.
Nice to see you too.
I was hoping to have a word with Roman.
Oh, the prophet's not hearing any requests tonight.
We're closed.
Sorry.
I spoke to him this morning.
We agreed to meet tomorrow.
Maybe you could fit us in.
I can tell you he's booked solid tomorrow.
It's important.
He'll see you at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
Please be prompt.
I always am.
I know you are, dear.
Hey, Bill.
Wanda, whatcha doin'?
Caulking.
Say, how's Joey doing?
Good so far.
He's been sober for seven months, and everyone says the first year is the real test, so we're over halfway there.
Come on!
Oh no, I'm not seeing him.
Don't make Joey be alone with him.
Let's go.
Get your brother.
So...
W hat?
I'm having an affair.
With who?
Bill.
Your husband Bill?
Shh.
Yes.
Yes.
All right.
At first, I didn know what was happening, but we started meeting in motels.
I don't like the sneaking around.
Actually, I love the sneaking around.
It is so exciting.
- What?
- I don't know.
I guess I'm just surprised is all.
What do you expect to come of this?
Well, I'm not actually thinking of what's going to come of it.
I'm just enjoying it.
I thought you'd find it... amusing.
I just-
- I think--
No, I guess I just thought that if anyone else could relate to this, you could.
I understand that it's difficult sometimes to feel special in your marriage, but this is kind of dangerous, don't you think?
I think you're overdramatizing.
Well, I wouldn't want Don to do it to me.
Look, you love Bill, but so do the two other women who are married to him and their four children, who are your children too.
I think there is more to it than that.
It's complicated.
It is, of course.
Look, Barb, I just don't want to see you getting hurt.
He's not going to leave his wives.
Guess you heard your mother shot my tires out.
No, I didn't hear that.
Brand new radials.
What time you got?
7:40.
Close at 9:00.
Shot every single one of them.
Radials!
She said you threatened to kill her.
No, you said she tried to kill me.
No, I did not explicitly say that.
What are you, a lawyer?
I explicitly endured 14 shots of dimercaporal in my stomach and she has the audacity to ask me to make her first wife?
Let me tell you two guys something:
I will never under any circumstances let that woman have one sliver of contentment!
Not if I can have anything to do with it, and it this case I do have something to do with it.
It's good you came down, Bill, paid your respects to Roberta.
That was good.
She did a lot for you, Bill.
She got you to stop stuttering.
I don't know how she ever did that.
You were one wacky kid.
You remember, Joey, how he used to get up there to give testimony.
Yeah.
You know what, dad?
That's enough.
He used to get up... clear his throat, and he'd open his mouth--
"b-dah b-dah b-dah b-dah b-dah"...
He sounded like porky pig.
It was funny.
You guys.
Your mother always told everybody that she married beneath her.
Yeah?
Well, looky now.
I'm on the priesthood council... and she is a train wreck.
Hi.
I have a little project.
Come on, Joey.
Stop dawdling.
You act like you're still on those pills, walking around in a fog half the time.
I was going to get some oil.
Calm down.
He's doing you a favor.
You should be thanking him.
No, he should be thanking me.
I don't know how you stand him.
I try not to spend much time with him is all.
- Yeah.
- Hurry up.
- It's kind of fancy though.
- Good craftsmanship.
Here she is.
This is it.
279.99.
Dad, maybe that one's not in stock, or--
Not in stock?
This one.
This is the one.
It's made out of particle board and felt.
And it's got a broken handle.
They'll give us a discount.
Get the truck, Joey.
We'll load it up.
Let's go.
Whoa, whoa.
We should get her something nicer.
Maybe this cherry one.
Roberta was a simple woman.
She'd have never gone for a fancy coffin.
If you'd have bothered to spend time with her, you would have known that.
You should have done something nice for her while she was alive.
But if it means that much to you, you can buy the cheaper one.
Paul Bunyan, run the man's credit card.
We're done here.
Come on, Joey.
Get the truck.
Let's go.
The nurses are trying to kill me.
Nobody's trying to kill you, babe.
This is much sadder than I thought it would be.
I mean, "Love Actually."
I thought it meant actually love, you know?
I guess he's a schizophrenic, right?
Isn't he?
Mmm.
I think so.
Don't do that, my darling.
Oh, no thanks, sweetie.
I have diverticulitis.
Oh, sorry.
What causes that?
Stress mostly.
And nuts.
Stress causes everything.
You don't mind this, do you?
I have to finish it by tomorrow.
Mmm, no.
Is it for charity?
Relief society.
We're toy-bombing Africa.
Helping those in need feels so good.
Sometimes I think I'm downright selfish.
What's the story with your neighbor, the blonde one, Nicki?
What do you mean?
Don't you find her a little strange, standoffish?
I wave-she doesn't wave back;
the way she dresses.
What's she like?
She's shy.
What else?
That's it.
You scared me.
Knock!
What are you doing?
What?
You had the neighbor lady here.
So?
Her name's Pam.
Do you think because my dad's away you can do whatever you want?
What's wrong with you?
You know you have to be careful about who you have over.
You just disregard that and who that affects?
No.
God!
- Don't say that!
- Stop yelling at me!
I just think you're being disrespectful.
Well, I just wanted to watch a fucking romantic comedy, Ben!
Please don't tell your dad I said that.
I won't.
Why would you even think that?
'Cause you're being so joe bossy.
I'm just trying to protect the family.
Don't be mad at me.
No, I'm not mad at you.
Are you unhappy?
No.
I just-- it's just so hard having to be so cautious about everything and everybody all the time.
I'm not used to it.
She and I hit it off.
You have no idea how much of my day I spend alone.
You just need a place to go that's neutral, like a class or something, where you can meet people.
You just-- you can't invite them over.
Is it hard for you?
It was at first, but now it's not.
I just keep things separate.
You never complain.
You're a good guy, Ben.
Thanks.
Kiss me.
Kiss me again...
Hello.
What are you doing?
I'm sewing a button on your shirt.
No.
What are you doing?
I'm... taking my blouse off.
What are you doing?
Taking my pants off.
No, I'm taking your pants off.
...Very very clearly.
I mean, enunciate.
You know the meaning of each word now, right?
Bill, come in.
Rhonda's reciting.
Go ahead, Rhonda.
Quote.
"The day came slow, till five o'clock
Then sprang before the hills
Like hindered rubies, or the light
A sudden musket spills
The purple could not keep the east
The sunrise shook from fold,
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
The lady just unrolled."
End quote.
Beautiful.
Really super.
Poem 572.
Emily Dickinson.
She knows her treasury.
Now, what can I do for you?
I'd like to settle our dispute once and for all, just square everything up.
What do you say?
Oh, shame on you, Bill.
There's a time and place for everything.
We're bereaving the loss of dear Roberta.
You agreed to discuss it yesterday.
I'm not talking business now, Bill.
Rhonda, recite another.
But--
"The burial of Moses."
"By Nebo's lonely mountain,
On this side Jordan's wave,
On a vale in the land of Moab,
- There lies a lonely grave"--
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse us, darling.
Goodbye, Bill.
I propose a cash settlement.
Do you have a figure in mind or am I supposed to guess?
A settlement composed of two parts:
the first-- $50,000 in cash the second part-- your real estate ventures, how are they doing?
They're not germane to this conversation.
The Deseret properties lawsuit?
Uh, what's that?
I think you know.
Well, I may be the prophet, but I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, we should ask your son Alby.
Right now it's a small private lawsuit in Sanpete County-- quiet, contained.
The attorney general's office tells me that they would just love to use it for the base of a broader investigation into fraud and the U.E.B.-- subpoenas, investigators, auditors.
They're waiting for my call... and this information.
You've got to be kidding.
You're blackmailing me?
The initial loan has been repaid, Roman, in full and then some.
I'm offering the sum of 50,000.
You give me a general release and stop the harassment.
I've given you the courtesy of listening to your proposal.
Do me the kindness of leaving now.
Good offer.
You should take it.
And a message for your son-- tell him he had better never ever come near my homes or my businesses again.
Get out of here.
She says the blades are wrecked.
She says someone's been bad.
Yes.
- Because someone put a can down there.
- It wasn't me.
It needs a whole new unit.
Well, Barb can get one at the store.
Well, Barb's not here.
Talk to her when she gets back.
This isn't exactly an efficient system.
Do you think she's happy for me... about the baby?
Of course.
She loves babies.
Sometimes I think she wishes my boys were hers.
Sometimes I think they wish the same thing.
Oh, ha ha.
I'll go get your new disposal.
Wait, Nicki, you can't do that.
Well, do you want it fixed or not?
- Brother.
- Thank you.
Come on, mom.
I have no business here.
I'm gonna be publicly humiliated.
Nobody will be humiliated.
Today we're all just family.
Isn't that right, Joey?
That's right.
"Family."
I gave my life to them, and they-- they all hate me.
Come on, take my arm.
We're here for you, Joey and Wanda and me.
What are you looking at?
Oh, watch it there, fumbles.
23, 42, 31, hike!
"I got it!
I got it!
I-- oh."
Come on, Wanda.
Program.
Program.
- Mother, what are you doing?
- Um, not there.
- No, this is where the family sits.
- They've asked me not to.
Well, too bad.
Come on.
- Don't make a fuss.
- Joey, help me out here.
No one wants me, and I don't care.
I don't care.
Come on, Lois.
Let's just sit down.
Bill.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
And how are you today?
Find everything all right?
Yes, thanks.
I get an employee family discount on this?
May I have your employee discount card, please?
I don't have my card with me, but it's under the name Barbara Henrickson.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't get the discount without the card.
That's the policy.
You'll have to call upstairs, because I definitely get a discount.
It's under Barbara Henrickson, as in "Henrickson Home Plus."
Okay, but your credit card here says "Nicolette Grant."
If you call upstairs to Don Embry, he'll vouch for me.
But I have no way of giving you the discount without the discount card.
You've said that 50 times.
You keep repeating yourself.
But if you pick up your phone--
Pick it up.
Just pick up the phone.
Hey, shoppers, who's up for Barbecue?
Grill and grill accessories are now 20% off.
Hey, someone save me a burger.
Uh, manager to lane six.
What are you doing?
- Manager to lane six.
- Please stop that.
I have a "hold card" instruction from your credit card company.
I need a manager.
- Give me my card back.
- I can't do that.
- Is there a problem?
- Um, it says "hold card,"
and she says that she's entitled to Barbara Henrickson's family discount.
Mr. Henrickson's wife?
Correct.
I-I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
You're not Barbara Henrickson.
No.
However, Barbara Henrickson asked me to purchase this disposal for her family.
I see.
So are you a relative of the Henricksons?
I'd like to speak to Don Embry now, please.
Or to Peg.
He's not here today.
Ma'am, if you could come with me, I'm sure we can work something out.
All right, fine.
And I shall call you "wife" through the veil... in the celestial kingdom... by the name... known only to me.
And I'll pull you through to be reunited with me... for all eternity.
How can I ever be worthy of you Roberta?
Mother, mother.
As all of you have attested today loyalty, humility kindness,
love of God and love of family--
Roberta.
I can't imagine a better first wife or a better sisterwife.
Lord knows I can't.
But I know she's gonna be smiling down... when dear Nita here... takes her place by my side... as first wife.
It's okay.
Mom, it's okay--
I wanna talk to you.
Uh, I'm a little busy.
She's not going anywhere.
Just what the heck do you think you're doing?
I'm trying to bury my wife, if you don't mind.
- How much?
- How much what?
How much to stop humiliating and shunning my mother and make her your first wife once and for all?
I can't do that to Nita.
15,000.
Not $15,000.
Well, I'm certainly not doing it for less than 10.
- Three.
- 10.
I'll give you five.
How's your roof?
Leaks.
I'll throw in roofing tiles.
How many?
As many as you need.
You really like that woman that much?
I need tar.
Throw in the tar and we got a deal.
I'll cut the check and send the supplies just as soon as you show me the marriage certificate.
Bless you.
God will have a humble people.
Either we can choose to be humble or we can be compelled.
You'll have an answer to your proposal soon.
I am so sorry, Mrs. Henrickson, to have had you come all the way down here, but first she said she was your sister, then she said she was your neighbor, and I thought,
"this sounds like identity theft to me."
Oh... if I had just given her the card.
You mean your sister?
But I was in such a hurry this morning, it just... slipped my mind.
Sally, can you scan this for Mrs. Henrickson?
You know, Mr. Henrickson is super strict about family members presenting the actual discount card, because otherwise, you know, somebody's sister or somebody's neighbor or something could say,
"oh, I'm related to so-and-so.
I get 20% off too."
I understand. thank you.
oh, Wendy-
- Wendy Hunt.
Here you go.
Get in.
Nicki, just get in the car.
I don't understand why you just didn't ask me.
Because I do not want to have to ask your permission for everything!
Every single thing I do!
Don't break my glove compartment.
Welcome to checkers.
May I take your order?
Can I get two strawberry shakes, please?
Will that be all?
- Do you want anything else?
- No.
Fries.
A medium fries, please.
I'm trying, Nicki.
I'm really trying.
Your total is $5.03.
Would you like ketchup?
Of course we want ketchup.
They're fries.
Don't take it out on her.
It was a stupid question.
I am so tired of you goading me.
Sorry, Mrs. Henrickson.
That is exactly what I'm talking about.
What is this about?
Why do you want to control the schedule?
I'm trying to have a baby.
I-I thought it would be easier.
Well, you never once did that before.
You always loved it when we were getting pregnant.
And I love it now.
Oh, tell the truth.
You don't want me to have the baby.
- That's nuts.
- I'm not nuts!
I didn't say you were nuts.
I said this is nuts.
I'm doing it to bring the family closer together.
Well, I'm part of this family, and you seem to have a lot of complaints.
- About what?
- About me, Nicki.
About everything I do.
About my responsibilities.
Well, try being second wife.
You just saw what happened.
Do you ever consider I have no public life with Bill, and you control everything?
Well, I'm...
Sorry I didn't die.
Oh, shut up.
And how can you say that?
How can you say that to me when I'm the one that took care of you.
I know that.
It's like you forget.
I watched you while you were sleeping.
I prayed for you to get better.
I don't see how you could say something like that to me.
Listen to me.
I will never forget what you did for me.
I will never forget it.
What?
I want you to have the baby.
I wanted to have a girl for you.
Bill here.
You left in a hurry.
I just wanted to get on the road.
Well, I just wanted to tell you that your father had a change of heart.
About what?
We're gonna be legally married!
Congratulations.
No gifts, please!
Are you happy?
Oh, well, you know me.
I have a naturally cheerful countenance.
But anyway, I just-
- I just wanted to let you know.
We won't be moving in together, which means we'll probably get along a little better, but it won't matter anyway.
He won't be around much longer.
What do you mean?
Oh, just that he's not getting any younger is all.
Don't you go telling him I said that.
No, I won't.
Anyway, we'll be just fine.
Just wanted to let you know the good news.
Margie, I think he's hungry.
- Hey, everybody.
- Your father's home.
Daddy!
Hey, buddy.
You've been a good boy with your mommies?
Your dad's home.
Hey, pull up a chair.
Looks like it's clouding over.
Dad?
What is it?
Do you think I should have more than one wife?
I mean, do you want me to live the principle when I'm ready?
Is it something you feel you want?
I don't know.
I hadn't really thought about it.
I just wanted to know if you had planned it for me.
Plural marriage is a tremendous responsibility, Ben, and it can be terribly abused.
It's not for every man.
God calls us to it, and we have to answer with fortitude.
But if you're asking me-- do I think you're capable?
Yes, I do.
I think I've had an idea, like-- like, that I could be good at it.
That doesn't surprise me.
You have a big heart, son.
What do you say we keep an eye on it?
Get some sleep.
You got $40 for the cab?
Look.
It's for your front porch.
They wanted $7, but I got them down to $2.50.
So did you and Frank enjoy Mexico?
Oh, yes.
It was nice to go back to the old stomping ground.
You know, we all hid out there for a year when my father was facing arrest.
Where the heck is Bill?
It's two hours to get home, and we got to get on the road.
Bill!
It's time to go!
Wanda's gonna have that baby if you don't hurry up.
Bill!
Yeah, fax came through.
Thanks, Lee.
Don't worry about me.
Best behavior, like a boy scout.
Look at all those houses.
Who do you suppose lives in all those houses?
Don't know.
Good night.
You're awful quiet, Bill.
Mom, can I take you into my confidence?
I need your help.
What is it?
Take a look at this.
Tell me who you know.
On the UEB council?
Bill?
Just anyone who's a holdover from grandpa's days.
I thought you and Roman settled things.
It's become personal now.
Roman blocked the sale of the land on the third store.
Drop it.
Is there someone whose loyalties aren't firm, who might be just willing to talk?
I set you down six years ago.
I warned you when you married Nicki--
"Don't you get into bed with that family," but you wouldn't listen.
What exactly are you up to?
I want eyes on the UEB council.
A mole?
You know, that is playing with fire.
I know.
Henricksons.
Who, may I ask, is calling?
You tell me first.
Oh, hi, aunt Cindy.
Yes, it's Teenie.
Okay.
- Tell her I'm outside.
- Aunt Cindy is visiting.
Hi, Cindy.
What are you doing here?
Oh, general conference was last month.
Oh, no.
No law against it.
I'm just used to it being once year.
No, twice is great.
It's great.
No, really great.
Mm-hmm.
No, it's just ice.
No, I know-
- I know it will.
No.
No, I know you do.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
No, down--downtown's fine.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right, I'll see you then.
Student-teacher conference.
Okay, number one-
- Teenie's baptism, saturday.
- We need to clean the pool.
- Benny'll do that.
Uh, and we need Bill's white shoes and pants and nice white shirt starched and pressed.
Margie, would you like to run with that?
Washing and readying Bill's whites?
Sure.
Uh, we need to go grocery shopping for the party.
There's a party?
What kind of party?
It's like a birthday party, but it's a baptism reception.
- Do you mind?
- Just make out a list.
And most important of all, I want to get her her own bible as a gift.
Would you care to do that, Margene?
Is that all?
That's all.
Okay.
I have things to do then.
Did you see that?
I tried to make her feel included, to feel important.
It's just a show for that two-one vote issue.
I mean, how much longer is this gonna go on?
"Do Bill's whites, Margene."
"This is very important, Margene."
"We couldn't do this without you, Margene."
They think mommy's a moron.
Joseph finally got his varsity patch for cross-country.
And Jennifer is the shortstop on the JV softball team.
A freshman on the JV team is really really good.
She was disappointed, and I said, "sweetheart... doesn't mean you can't make an olympic team one day."
But look, our golden lion-
- Kim-Ly.
She's eight now.
Such beautiful skin-- like a doll.
And her accent's almost completely gone.
She's gonna be saying "y'all" by the time she's in the sixth grade I think.
Oh, she's so good in music and math.
Wow.
Oh, asian children are just more talented in certain areas.
So show me yours.
Uh, I don't know what I have here.
- What's that one?
- Uh, that's of everybody.
Oh, okay.
Here we go.
Oh my goodness.
They've grown up to be so good-looking.
Sarah's making straight A's.
Uh, Ben is team captain in baseball, and Teenie is a handful, but that's to be expected from a child in the gate program-- gifted and talented-- a handful.
Teenie turned eight and she's getting baptized this weekend.
And who's baptizing her?
Bill...
like the other two.
And where is she gonna be baptized?
In our backyard.
Oh, mom would love to see this picture, Barbie.
I wish you knew how badly mom feels about this estrangement.
I mean, she prays every night that she'll have you back in her life again.
Me too.
Birthdays, baptisms, if Ben wins a game--
I just want to call and tell her.
She misses Ben and Sarah.
And-and she hardly knows Teenie outside of little clues like this.
I think everyone feels that this lack of communication has just gone on way way way too long.
Well, I haven't had my family since I left that hospital bed--
For seven years.
When you survive something like that and you want your family with you more than anything in the whole world, and then they're gone...
Let's talk straight for a second.
You didn't just leave that hospital.
You left that hospital and you followed Bill into polygamy.
I mean, you couldn't have shocked us more if you'd put a towel on your head and converted to islam.
It's--
Do you really think it might be time for me to come by?
How about we start with the kids?
Oh, just the children?
I don't know if she's ready to see you just yet.
She takes things slow.
You know, it's mom.
I'll think about it.
Okay.
Here.
Open it.
Christ, Ben, did you make this?
That's why I stayed late the past couple of days.
I still want to sand off some of glue drips, you know, restain it.
What are you doing?
Stop.
Just stop it.
We've had eight real go-out dates, Ben, and school together, and back and forth from school almost every day for a couple of months.
But we're stuck.
We're going backwards.
Could we go to your room and talk?
Yeah, but I don't want to talk.
Benny, I'm ready and so are you.
Seriously, why can't we just wait?
Do you know what it feels like to have a guy say no to that?
It feels like shit.
You need to date somebody that wants what you want.
No, I really really like you.
Please don't do this.
Hi, Benny.
Well, come in.
- I got raspberry crispies.
- He's leaving, mom.
It'll be all right.
We can still be friends.
Okay?
Disaster mode.
Serious disaster.
- Material, personal or hygienic?
- I don't know, crayons.
- Where?
- In the dryer.
Goof be gone-spray it on, stains come right off.
Aisle six at fields.
- And I have one for you.
- What?
- It's about your neighbor.
- Mm-Hmm.
Barb?
No, Barb's sweet.
The other one, "the braid."
The missionaries I referred to her-
- She's fundamentalist, polygamist.
Right on our street.
Isn't that terrible?
They're like cockroaches.
No, I don't mean that in a harsh way.
I mean that they come in and try to hide.
They're secretive probably because of the shame of it all.
It's so sad.
And that's exactly what she does, poor thing.
Poor thing.
I'm gonna mention her to the neighborhood crime watch, just to keep an extra set of eyes out.
They can be ruthless-- kidnapping and all kinds of unspeakable things when they fight with each other.
Are you all right?
Oh, no, I'm-I'm okay, thanks.
Uh, I guess that's what we should do-- crime watch on "the braid."
Did we miss it?
- Just breathe, all right?
- Oh.
No, not yet.
We're eight hours in and no sign of the bundle of joy.
- You made it.
- Heck yeah.
- Hi.
- Oh, I brought gifts.
- Wow, thanks.
- Wanda, I brought you a pot!
Mom circled these three names.
Lucas Milford?
Don't go there.
Two of his wives are Jacobsons.
Two or three of Roman's wives are Jacobsons too.
They'll rat you out faster than he does.
Sam Tilson?
He seems all right, but I don't know who all he's married to, so...
Maybe you could look at the genealogy records in the library.
Bill, Roman's wives run that place.
And it's not like I'm a big reader.
They'll notice me.
Tell them you want to look at the records for your baby.
Look up Tilson and-and this other guy Holloway.
See who their wives are, who they're married to.
I want no connection to Roman.
Look, if you don't want to be involved, I understand.
I do.
But I wouldn't ask you to do this if I didn't trust that you could do it without drawing attention.
Joey!
Get in here.
And get that Adaleen and her grandchildren out.
- Joey!
- Coming!
I knew that's who it was.
It's so obvious, Barb.
I saw you leave, and I thought,
"who else but Cindy would you wear a scarf like that with anymore?"
Well, you're certainly not gonna give in to such a horrid request.
It's their aunt and grandma.
It's a ridiculous thing to ask.
Where's the phone?
Teenie!
It's only dad.
Hello?
No.
No no no.
I understand.
Shouldn't be much longer, but I'm clearly not getting home tonight.
And Joey wants me to stay for the blessing after all this.
So...
Okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
Okay.
Good night.
What, is your boyfriend calling?
No, is yours?
Teenie.
Don't let your sister near those kids, Barb.
She's judgmental, and she only makes you feel bad about yourself.
You don't have to let her back in.
I can't stand her either.
Is he all right?
Perfect.
He is just perfect.
This one's gonna live.
Well, go on, papa.
You won't break him.
You're gonna be all right, little man.
I'm gonna make sure of it.
I'll think of it as a first step.
Right.
A first step in the healing process, yes.
Uh, well, all right, how about 3:30?
No, I'll have them home from school by then if you wanna pick them up.
I love you too.
It's just crayon, okay?
I've got it under control.
See? "Removes crayon with ease."
- Back away from the dryer.
- What?
Cleaning a dryer with flammable liquids?
!
You could have blown up the whole house.
- Can I go inside now?
- No, wait for Nicki.
- God.
- Hey, watch your language.
Margie, I swear-- worse than a child.
You want equality, and we'd love to give it, but you've gotta earn it.
All right, Nicki, I think you're going--
Barb, trying to get us all killed is not exactly batting 1000.
- Please show some responsibility.
- I'll fix it.
- No, don't touch it.
- I'll fix it tomorrow.
I got them.
Adaleen kept coming in and out.
I didn't have time to write stuff down without her seeing what I was looking at, so I just-
- I just took them.
Joey, don't ignore your guests.
Come bless that baby.
We were just going over the prayer.
Oh, please.
What do you two have?
Move.
You stole these from the library?
She didn't see.
You know what they'll do if they find out what you're up to?
They will rub us out.
Mom, I asked her to photocopy the family tree, then I stuffed them inside my shirt when she was gone, okay?
Hey, look.
These are Tilson's wives.
Any connection to Roman?
Nanette Henley.
She's only 18 years old.
Tilson's impotent and Roman still gives him young wives.
An impotent man in his 70s is not gonna be jumping to rat out the man who put him in bed with a teenager.
What about Holloway?
He ran the physical fitness program at the academy until it was shut down.
A little off in the noggin.
Had shingles and went stark raving mad for a few years.
Huh.
He's only got one new wife in 10 years.
Either he's gotten his fill or he's been cut off.
Hi, Cindy.
What are you doing?
Well, hello, Nicki.
Picking up Barb's kids.
I'm running early like always.
Well, come in.
I'll give you a tour around the new places till they get home.
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm fine right here.
Of course you are.
But it'd really be my pleasure.
Wayne, Raymond.
Get down and say hello to your aunt Cindy.
- Hi, aunt Cindy.
- Hi.
You should really come around more often.
Family is so important.
Don't you agree?
Certainly--
Must be so hard to leave your kids when you travel.
Oh, we have a terrific nanny.
Oh, I can't imagine not raising my own kids.
So this is the backyard.
Look how big.
You should bring your boy out.
He and Ben could toss around the football, and without the fences, it's almost a regulation field.
Oh, most certainly is.
So it goes me, Margene, and Barb at the far end.
Three sisterwives in a row.
No fences-- kind of a metaphor for sisterhood--
Working together, bringing down the walls, acceptance, love.
My goodness, stop me.
I sound like a greeting card.
But you know what I mean.
Well, of course you do.
You're her real sister, right?
- Hmm, obviously.
- Of course.
So this is Margie's.
- Have you met Margene yet?
- No, not yet.
Well, you know, number three is always such a dear blessing.
- We'll stop in.
- This last one's Barbie's?
Hey.
Oh, you've grown so big.
Look at you.
- Hi, Barb.
- Hello, Nicki.
- Hi, aunt Cindy.
- Oh, look how big you are.
- Hi.
- Hi, Sarah.
You weren't gonna fill me in?
- It's a first step.
- It's a terrible idea.
She'll try and put things in their heads about us.
If you think for one second I'll sit idly by and let that woman walk all over you and us and them, you're wrong.
They'll be fine, Nicki.
Do we seriously have to go?
Just play nice on this trip, okay?
All righty.
Let's go, Sarah.
Bye, Barb.
I'll have them back safe and sound by tonight.
Uh, no, I'll pick them up.
Oh no.
I can drive them both ways.
Small steps, Barb.
Small steps.
Okay, let's go.
Assert yourself, Barb.
You can't straddle this fence if it's not who you are.
It will drive you crazy.
I know.
I'm sorry, Nicki.
Not to me.
It's those poor kids who have to be with her in the car for an hour.
I personally enjoy watching her mouth get all pouty.
We're gonna run away.
We can't live here anymore.
We're gonna go far far away... to a place where there's no neighborhood watches.
I said I'd drive them back.
I can't keep doing this.
I wanna see mom.
Please, can you go inside and just tell her that I'm coming in?
- She's taking a nap.
- Then wake her up.
Selfish, Barbie.
This isn't about you.
If anything happened to you, your babies would be my responsibility and I am trying to do everything in my power to have a relationship with them.
What's between you and our mother-- that goes much deeper.
Those were your choices.
Bye.
Oh, bye, Teenie.
Bye, Sarah.
- Ben.
- Bye, aunt Cindy.
Think about what we talked about, Benny.
What does she want you to think about?
Moving out to Texas for the summer.
I left my Game Boy in there.
We'll get a new one.
Do we really have to live with her if something happens to you?
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Just take a nap.
It's a long way home.
We need these exact brands in these exact same sizes by tomorrow.
Don't tell your mom I screwed up, okay?
Don't worry, you're good.
Sarah, do you think of yourself as a polygamist?
No.
Well, kind of.
For the longest time I thought I wasn't.
I mean, "my family may be and my parents may be, but I'm not."
But then I was like, "well, I mean, I'm living here, so whether I like it or not, I kind of am."
Yeah, that's the weird part.
I never did.
And now I kind of do, and now I don't know what I think about it all.
I mean, I fell in love with your dad, and I love your mom and Nicki and you guys, but I never really thought of myself that way, you know?
And then...
I woke up and I suddenly realize...
"I'm 23.
I'm a polygamist.
Whoa!
What's going on?
Did I choose this or did it just happen to me?"
I think you chose it.
Yeah, I guess so.
At first, we were all just living together in one house and I just thought we were sort of like roommates.
Are you gonna leave?
No!
Why did you ask that?
Before you married dad, Nicki bet my mom that you would leave within six months.
I guess she was wrong.
Yeah, she was wrong.
These don't have any tags on them.
What size do you want?
I don't even know his sizes.
I am a terrible wife.
I should have never married your father.
And your mother.
- And Nicki.
- Especially Nicki.
Hi, Brynn.
Um, can you please call me back?
I just need to talk for a minute.
Okay?
Just one minute.
Good night.
- Ernest Holloway, right?
- Yeah.
How may I help you two?
I'm Bill Henrickson.
This is my brother Joey.
We're Orville Henrickson's grandsons.
We were hoping that maybe we could have a word with you.
Dick Francis.
Borrow it.
I consider it one of his best.
I'll take a look.
Oh, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
It pleases me that you share an interest in the academy.
The boys and girls who call this place home need good physical education.
It killed me when the council voted PE out of the academy.
- I understand, brother Holloway.
- We had a full gymnasium.
I spoke before councilmember Dorothy "dot" Campbell--
President's council on physical fitness.
I'd like to help you, Ernest.
One more time?
I'd like to help.
I came from here.
Now I've made some success in life and I feel it's time to give something back.
I wanna make a donation, seed money to help you start new program.
And I think it best that we, well, keep these donations anonymous.
We'll do this with a handshake.
Trust among brothers.
You always travel with so very much cash?
There's something I need as well.
We hardly know each other, Bill.
Uh, ladies...
I need to know what Roman's up to on the council.
- What kinds of things?
- His business dealings, any and all of them, particularly the ones that have to do with me.
I think it's time for both of you to leave.
The man you hope to harm is the one true prophet of our most holy church.
May our heavenly father forgive you for this trespass.
May the Lord be with you both.
They left that phone off the hook.
I know.
I'm sorry, Joey.
I need to get you back to your family.
Henricksons.
Who, may I ask, is calling?
Hi, this is Patty Lane from Farley Elementary.
Can I speak to Barbara Henrickson?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Henrickson's still out of town.
May I take a message?
- Is this Tancy?
- No.
May I take a message?
Tancy, I know this is you.
Please--
Whatcha got there?
Teenie?
Teenie!
No running by the pool, young lady!
Stop it!
Stop!
You want to sit down?
Teenie, sit down.
You don't want to tell me what's in that?
It's a secret.
Looks like a bad secret, right?
Maybe.
I have a bad secret too.
Look.
I bought this whole carton of cigarettes and I've been smoking them.
I haven't told anybody about it except for you.
You know what?
I feel better since I told you.
- You won't be mad at me?
- Promise.
It was a class project.
We had to write an essay on why our mom deserved to be mother of the year.
"Statewide finalist for best mother of the year."
You put your mom up for Utah mother of the year?
She's a finalist, and I don't know what to do.
Uh, you just tell her?
No, not her.
You and Nicki.
You're our moms, too, right?
I don't want to hurt your feelings.
- Do you see me like a mom?
- Yeah.
Oh, Teenie.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Teenie, go home.
What?
What kind of an example are you setting?
Margene, you're grounded.
- Excuse me?
- Or you're on probation.
I mean, you do not involve our kids in your filthy habits.
No.
No way.
You have no authority over me.
Authority?
You wait just one minute.
I'm second, you're third.
Get it?
Second's not first.
It's nothing.
If you have a problem, you can talk to our husband about it.
Oh, you listen to me, Margie.
I'm no cream puff like Barb.
I don't like a lot of people, but I liked you.
And eventually I wanted you in this family because I grew to love you.
But in the last three years, I have never known you to make a single adult decision.
Okay, Nicki, it was great talking to you.
See you later, right?
Your wife and your beautiful new baby could use your attention, Joey.
No more playing dirty.
All right, Bill?
You get home to your family safely.
Just try to tell her how you really feel.
Sincerity counts.
Brynn, you have a guest.
- She's lucky to have you.
- Thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I don't have anything to talk to you about.
I don't want to talk anymore either.
- Shut those.
- Okay.
You first.
Keep--keep going.
Slow.
Did it happen?
Yeah.
Catch.
That looks great.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
What a surprise.
Come on in.
I wanted to bring by Teenie's Game Boy before I head back to the airport.
She left it in mom's bedroom.
My game!
- Is that your new baptism dress?
- Yes, it is.
Thank you, aunt Cindy.
Barbie?
Really, baptism in the swimming pool is just the silliest thing I've ever heard of.
Now I talked to mom and she said that she would be more than happy to baptize Teenie in their ward's vault.
The children are innocent.
You shouldn't involve them in this.
There's nothing wrong with our backyard.
Any body of water is just as righteous as the next.
What kind of example are you setting for them?
Sarah is so overtly independent and headstrong now.
She said she might become a southern baptist, Barb.
It was a joke.
Well, that only reinforces my point.
And Teenie is following right in her footsteps.
And poor Ben-- he's the only one who shows any signs of redemption--
Hello, Cindy.
Not staying for my punch?
No.
- Then please leave our house.
- This is not your house.
Oh, shush it.
There's nothing wrong with our children.
They are perfectly strong-minded, independent works of art, much like their mothers.
And I would hazard--
- Excuse me!
Barb--
- I said shush it!
Our children are at least three times as cared for, and Barb is 10 times the mother.
Where are your children when you skip off every week on business?
Family first, right?
Then how about you go home to yours and leave us to our own?
My dear, polygamy 100 years ago was quaint.
Polygamy today is foul.
That's just the way it is.
God forbid--
You should go, Cindy.
God forbid something should happen to my sister, and those children are my responsibility, not yours.
And I will do everything in my power to ensure that they grow up to be good, strong, moral young people.
God forbid.
Now get out!
Benny, choose the right always.
I just can't stand by and watch somebody hurt you.
Oh, no!
Oh, it works great on walls.
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.
No, it's fine.
It's fine.
But, Pam, I don't think I can be friends with you anymore.
No.
No no.
I'll pay for the clothes that got ruined, Margie.
Oh, no, it's not the clothes.
Then why?
Well, I am who I am, and you are who you are, and I can't be me when I'm with you, not 100% me.
Of course you can.
No, I can't.
Because I'm only barely starting to understand the real me and maybe I just need a little alone time to figure that out for a while.
You can try and do that with me.
Oh, I don't think so.
And, Pam...
Nicki is a good person.
She's not a cockroach.
And I'd never do anything to hurt her.
I'm sorry if I led you to believe that I would.
Goodbye, Pam.
Goodbye, Margie.
We need to talk about the children.
A big talk or a little talk?
Kind of big, I guess.
Well, are you sure this is the time?
Yes.
If anything ever happened to us,
I don't want them going to my sister anymore.
I want them to stay here with their family.
I wanna look at the will.
Oh, Barb.
Honey... it gives me a great deal of joy to hear you say that, a great deal.
Dad, there's someone in a van out front.
Compound people.
Is there something I can help you with?
Can you provide for my protection, Bill?
I believe I can.
I'm prepared to do... as you ask of me.
Why?
Your grandfather's death sat very high on my mind last night, Bill.
Orville and Roman were not alone on their final trip.
Our heavenly father was in that truck when your grandfather died and he saw how Roman wrestled his way to where he is now.
And mighty his wrath will be come judgment day.
Brother Holloway, in my world such allegations need substantiation.
I'm a man of faith, Bill, willing to risk blood atonement for the truth.
Your heart knows if you should trust me.
This was your grandfather's.
And you should know, young man, that he saw something very special in you.
And he was not at all shy about that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Tancy Henrickson, having been commissioned of Jesus Christ,
I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the son and of the holy ghost, amen.
I wanna be the first to welcome you as an adult member of our family for all eternity, with all the responsibilities and privileges of family and faith.
Margie?
Me next.
I need to be baptized.
Right now.
Right this minute.
I'm sorry, Teenie.
Bill, when I married into this family,
I guess I must have thought I was just marrying you.
And now I realize I was marrying all of you.
I was marrying sisters-- my sisters.
That was my choice, and I'd make that choice all over again right now.
And I know, I know I've made a lot of mistakes... lately and-- all right, maybe always, but I can get better.
I will, because-- because I wanna be with you guys forever too.
'Cause I love you guys, and I need you guys.
And I never ever wanted to not be in this family, here or in heaven.
Now.
I'm ready.
Margene Heffman, having been commissioned of Jesus Christ,
I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the son and of the holy ghost, amen.
Hold your nose.
Dear heavenly Father, I have knowingly sinned against you.
Please, I will follow your path wherever you want me to go if you'll tell me a prayer or a way to have back my virtue, my virginity.
Please, dear Lord, I need you with me now.

Willow's Team
She loves me.
She loves me not.
She loves me.
She loves me not.
I'm not a nurse-in-training, I'm a nurse-in-decorating.
Valentine's Day.
Can I help?
-Can't you just do it?
-Come on.
ER.
Carol, can you find Dr. Ross for Mrs. Hall?
Sure.
Mrs...?
-Hall.
Dr. Ross is the pediatrician?
-Yeah, what's the problem?
-Tatiana, she's very sick.
-You don't feel well?
She has a fever and a cough.
It just doesn't seem right.
-Okay, come right this way.
-Thank you.
Mark, it's 1 0:00.
So?
So you got in at 8, remember?
You weren't here overnight.
I was taking a nap.
Is there anything wrong with taking a nap?
Certainly not.
Stomach ache in 2, bounce-back migraine in 1.
Can I give them an ETA?
Does that tickle?
-Temperature's 1 00.
-Does this hurt?
She doesn't speak much English.
She's Russian.
I adopted her in St. Petersburg 1 0 days ago.
-When did the fever start?
-I'd waited nearly six months.
Finally, all her paperwork was in order and medical certificates....
She really seemed fine.
-How long has she had the fever?
-Almost a week.
Start her on some oral amoxicillin.
She has some respiratory congestion and an ear infection which is causing the fever.
Don't worry, we'll take good care of her.
-Thank you, doctor.
-You're welcome.
Wendy, it's nice of you to volunteer to put those up.
I didn't volunteer.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Thanks, Lydia.
Here's another one for your stash.
Thank you.
Hello?
Amy.
Brooks.
-Wendy.
Patty.
-Come on.
-Who are these women?
-I don't remember.
-You're full of it.
-I don't remember meeting them.
Police!
Help!
Quick!
I hit him.
He dashed off the sidewalk chasing a ball.
I tried to swerve the car, but....
-Please!
-I'll page Benton.
Clear Trauma. 39-year-old male fell from the second-story balcony....
Watch yourself.
Mrs. Hall?
Mrs. Hall, wait.
Jerry, let me know when Mrs. Hall comes back.
-Sure.
-Thanks.
I tried to dodge him.
-Scalp laceration.
-I can't hear a thing.
He just came out of nowhere.
He's got a fractured left front radius?
Where do you want the IV?
-Please help him, okay, doc?
-Give me the bulletin.
-Car versus canine.
-Car versus canine?
Fractured left front leg.
Or maybe it's radius-ulna.
Nobody's sure how to take the BP.
A dog?
You called me down here for a dog?
The vet's office is sending someone over.
-What do we do?
-I'll name him Bill.
What are you, crazy?
You don't like the name Bill?
Call him whatever you want, but do it fast because little Bill here has stopped breathing.
He's one of God's creatures.
-I'm not a vet, Grabarsky.
-You could try.
No.
I'll be upstairs taking a gallbladder out of a Homo sapien.
-Did I miss anything?
-You were only gone ten seconds.
Poor little guy.
No collar, no tags.
-Must be lost, or a stray.
-I should've taken dog lab, not pig lab.
Digestive system, abdomen....
-Whoa, look at that spleen.
-Wow!
-Can we hurry this up, please?
-IV goes in what vein?
Try the large one.
Then give him some saline.
Somebody find out where the vet is.
Okay, here it is.
Intubation.
It's like with a human, but when pushing back the tongue you can see the vocal cords.
-Thank you, Carter.
-Get an Ambu bag.
Let's intubate.
Pneumothorax, right there.
-A what?
-Collapsed lung.
Oh, my God!
Lydia, get a 20-gauge needle on a 60cc syringe with a three-way stopcock.
Which intercostal is it?
-Try the eighth, just below the heart.
-All right.
Bill lives.
All we have to do is sew up the lac and get a cast on him and he'll be chasing squirrels by the afternoon.
Carter, Chen.
I think you can take it from here.
Somebody call housekeeping.
Tell them to get a hose.
No problem.
That was pretty cool, the way you gave it mouth-to-mouth.
Thank you.
You know, they say the dog's mouth is the cleanest part of its body.
What do they say about its nose?
-She said nothing during the exam?
-Nothing.
She brings her in, then disappears leaves a fake number.
Why would she do that?
-I have no idea.
-How could somebody do that?
-We don't know the whole story.
-We can't reach her anywhere.
I'll move Tatiana out to Curtain 2 so she doesn't feel so alone back here.
Then I guess I'll have to call Children and Family Services.
-Thanks, Haleh.
-Sure.
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Tatiana....
My mother's Russian.
How do you say "hello"?
I'm Dr. Ross.
I'm Doug.
I'm Doug.
So you do speak a little English.
So you don't.
You just stay right here.
We'll take care of you.
That was normal.
What do you mean?
Valentine's Day.
It's like full moons.
All the crazies come out.
-What's wrong with your neck?
-I slept on the sofa last night.
Sorry I asked.
You wanna tell me about it?
It's about five feet long.
It's got little blue flowers on it.
There's a spectacular stain on the right where Rachel did some projectile vomiting.
Still waiting on that stomach ache and migraine.
I am going to go get something to eat.
I'm loving this semi-foul mood of yours.
Yeah?
Well, imagine if we'd lost the dog.
See you.
Bye.
-Doug?
-"Do not steal.
Benton."
Anything good to eat in there?
You think Susan really wants this yogurt?
So you and Jen Valentining tonight?
She left for Milwaukee this morning.
-You?
-No, no.
Never.
I work the night shift Valentine's Day to avoid any possible dating conflicts.
-That sounds mature.
-I learned the hard way.
Dr. Ross, an ambulance is bringing a 1 7-year-old.
Crushed legs.
Some train accident.
Dr. Benton said to get you.
Thank you, Wendy.
Can you believe I said "thank you" for telling me I get to work on some kid whose legs have just been puréed?
Weird.
I thought you'd like some company.
Is that okay?
Had to clear Trauma anyway.
Thanks.
Carol, I could use you in Curtain Area 3.
You know, Mark always says Valentine's Day is like the full moon.
The nut cases come out.
I never really thought about it.
Cheerleaders.
Cheerleaders?
On acid.
Sounds like Mark was right.
-Are you Kirk Driscoll?
-Sure.
I'm Dr. Lewis.
This is Nurse Hathaway.
All three girls ingested LSD?
It's not funny.
Are you sure it was straight LSD and not mixed?
Yeah.
I got them right here if you wanna check.
-You laced chocolates?
-Pretty stupid, huh?
I only let them eat two each.
They could've had a seizure, kidney damage, gone into a coma.
We have to make sure there's no dangerous side effects.
You don't have to tell the cops, do you?
Yeah, we do.
And better yet, we get to tell your parents.
-Any Valentine's Day plans?
-Nope.
-No big date or anything?
-Nope.
So what was that about?
The flowers and the chocolates in the fridge?
-Oh, that.
-Yeah, that.
I met this pediatrician....
You what?
You what?
Hey, Peter!
What?
-What do you got?
-Michael Clifford, 1 7.
Lost a dare with a freight train.
Leg and head injuries.
Hypotensive, 80 over 60.
Fluid resuscitated 2,000cc's.
Brought the pressure up to 1 00.
Blood loss around three to four units.
Someone get on the horn with O.R.
Hang ten liters saline.
-Start him on Ancef, one gram, IV push.
-BP's dropped 80 over 40.
-Where's that O-neg?
-It's coming.
Another blood Y-tubing.
Popliteal.
No dorsalis pedis on the left.
Let's get an angiogram.
Oh, God!
He's got my hand!
-Don't lose that airway.
-He's seizing!
He's breaking her hand!
Grab a bite block!
Bounce-back migraine in 6.
I already saw him.
No, you saw the one in 1.
This is the one in 6.
Don't you guys work?
-Want one?
-No, thanks.
-You thought I was in a bad mood?
-What?
-Oh, my God.
-I gotta go.
-Don't you dare leave me.
-Excuse me.
-Dr.
Lewis?
-Dr.
Kayson.
Will you be mine?
Excuse me?
Happy Valentine's Day.
-Still 1 00.
-McGillis is here.
I'll be right back, okay?
Carol, how long is Sparky gonna be with us?
Until Grabarsky gets off duty tonight.
"One of God's creatures."
Hey, Deb.
Deb?
You all right?
What?
I said, are you okay?
Yeah.
Sure.
Very okay.
She left four hours ago.
Does that mean abandonment?
-It does.
-Merits an investigation.
She dumps a child who's sick, speaks no English, has no clue--
It's okay.
Tatiana needs to stay here at least 24 hours.
Longer if she doesn't get any better.
Then what happens?
Assuming Mom's still out of the picture Children and Family Services will find her a foster home.
There's nothing else we can do.
I have a lot of work to do.
I'm being released today.
You've made a remarkable recovery.
I couldn't have done it without you, Susan.
May I call you Susan?
Sure.
You said you needed to talk to me about something.
Every cardiologist should go through what I did.
Lying on that gurney, not knowing whether you're gonna live or die and seeing the face of this lovely, young resident hovering over you.
Well, I can understand how it must've been very scary for you.
It was terrifying at first.
But then, exhilarating.
Now I've got a whole new perspective on life.
My own and my patients'.
That's terrific.
I really should get back.
Have you thought about cardiology, Susan?
You'd be an excellent candidate.
And I'd like to help you.
Be a mentor of sorts.
-Thank you, Dr. Kayson--
-No, please call me Jack.
I'm still doing my ER residency.
I should just stick with that for now.
We should talk more about this another time.
That'd be fine.
Tonight, 8:00 dinner?
How's the pain?
I had a fifth of Demerol.
You mean 50 milligrams of Demerol?
I see that it's working.
Can you wiggle these fingers for me?
-I should stick with decorating.
-He crushed your hand pretty good.
You've got three metacarpal fractures, but I think you'll survive.
I'll get somebody to put a cast on.
-How's the boy?
-Boy?
The one who squeezed me got hit by that train.
He died up in O.R.
Dr. Greene, dueling meatpackers coming in.
About five minutes away.
-Carol?
-What?
-Whoa.
-Sorry.
-Are we not loving our job?
-I am not loving the limits of my job.
Watching that little girl sitting out there, completely abandoned.
Nothing we can do.
Maybe you need a change of pace.
How about a nice, greasy trauma?
Sunny-side up or over-easy?
I can offer you both.
Okay, but how long do I have to wait?
That's the beauty of it.
You don't.
-Happy Valentine's Day, Doris.
-Likewise, Dr. Greene.
Meet Mr. Lorenzo Renzetti.
45, sturdy, aluminum meat hook firmly embedded in his bicep.
How's that feel, Mr. Renzetti?
You can call me Lorenzo.
I don't know, it's not so bad.
That's good, because it sure looks bad.
Started one IV.
BP is 1 40 over 90.
Pulse 96, resp's 1 6.
Good distal pulses, normal cap refill.
Defensive lacerations on both arms.
Mr. Renzetti, we're gonna take care of you.
All right, we're gonna move him.
All right, on my count.
-One--
-Watch your back.
Why don't you just scoot over.
Don't let the gurney roll.
Okay.
Good.
I got you.
Doris, you said this was a twofer.
Second guy, second unit.
I drove circles around him.
Let's hand some Ancef, one gram, IV piggyback and let's update Lorenzo's tetanus.
I'll start a chart.
I had that when I went to the Caribbean.
-How was it?
-It was all right.
It rained a lot.
Want a chest film plus humerus films?
Call Radiology and get a portable.
Lorenzo.
Just lay down, okay?
Take it easy.
They should've brought Paulie here first.
Who's Paulie?
My stupid kid.
He made a crack about his mother.
I didn't want to fight, but he kept coming at me.
Move your thumb.
-Now your wrist.
-He kept jabbing me.
You shouldn't disrespect your mother.
Where is the son of a bitch?
I'm sure he's on his way.
He'd better be, because he's in worse shape than I am.
We're gonna take this out in surgery.
There he is!
Hey, Paulie!
I'm over here, son.
Your dad's over here.
You okay?
Son?
Carol, come with me.
He's in fib.
Paddles.
I'm right here, son.
I'm right here.
Is he all right?
-Two hundred.
-Charging.
Clear.
-Three hundred.
-Charging.
-Is he okay?
-Clear.
He's okay, right?
-Damn it!
360.
-Charging.
He needs more volume.
It's gonna be okay.
You'll be fine.
Exam 2?
Okay, here we go.
This way, you guys.
There you go.
We'll be with you in just a second.
You have to admit, they're pretty cute.
They've been spray-painted, giving them hives.
Children with hives are not cute.
So, Peter about the flower and candy in the refrigerator?
Are you gonna make me guess who they're for?
They're for my mother.
Really.
Excuse me, where is Exam Room 1 ?
-Thanks for moving her.
-Oh, sure.
She insisted on bringing Bill.
Hello and goodbye.
That and ten other words is the extent of my Russian.
They're kind of perfect together.
No idea where they are or what they're doing.
-Neither one of them seem to mind.
-The dog gets to go home with Grabarsky.
Maybe her mom will come back.
I don't think "mom" is the right word.
Carter, Dr. Ross needs you to help with some kids in Exam 2.
How do you say goodbye?
Tell Dr. Ross I need him now.
Hey, Deb.
Are you Wendy Goldman?
Yes Deb.
I'm Deborah Chen.
I know that.
I had the hardest time finding you.
I'm gonna be doing your cast.
-How long was he in the hot tub?
-40 minutes.
-Any wine?
-Champagne.
-How much?
-A little.
A couple of bottles.
-It's Valentine's Day.
-Eddie wanted something special.
-He got nauseous.
-Then he threw up.
-It was horrible.
-Then he sank.
We went under.
Both of us pulled him up.
Ran into the house.
Called 911.
-You did the right thing.
-We'll take it from here.
We're gonna take his temperature now.
Rectally.
You might wanna wait outside.
We'll be right back, okay?
You still think it's upper respiratory?
Now that she's hydrated, I heard rales.
Could be pneumonia or a foreign virus we know nothing about.
Fever's spiked up to 1 04.
I'm gonna put a rush on that x-ray.
-You give her acetaminophen?
-Yeah. 1 5 per kilo.
All the times my mom tried to teach me Russian.
All the times she yelled at me in Russian.
You deserved it.
Doctor B.
Mrs. Hayden, 85, fell and cut her arm.
She's in the Suture Room, and she's a tad senile.
Give it to Carter.
He's busy taking care of six small, red children.
Where's the other one?
Deb Chen?
Doing a cast.
All right, have her wait.
Is Dr. Ross here?
What's wrong?
I'm Jake Leeds.
I need to talk to Dr. Ross.
Look, he's very busy right now.
I can find someone else for you.
What's wrong?
My side and my stomach.
It really hurts.
We're gonna take him to Curtain 2.
Call his mom, Diane Leeds, up in Risk Management.
-Sure, Dr. Ross.
-Carol.
Come on, buddy.
All right, what's wrong?
Where's it hurt?
Here we go.
It started here in my stomach and now it feels like it's over here.
Like this?
There.
It hurts there.
Any vomiting or nausea?
-Right after gym.
-Temp's normal.
Okay, let's get a CBC, urinalysis and set him up for an ultrasound.
All right, Jake, hang tight.
We're gonna check you out.
-Where are we gonna put him?
-Admitting him straight upstairs.
Haleh, could you tell those two hookers that their friend is doing fine?
I think they'd rather talk to a doctor.
Tell them I'll meet them in the waiting room.
So what was that with Kayson?
What?
Oh, you know, he just wanted to tell me that he was fine, thank me.
Nice try.
I saw the bouquet.
Oh, God.
Did anyone else?
It was so embarrassing.
He just gave you flowers.
It's not like he asked you out or anything.
-He did?
-Dinner, tonight.
-What'd you say?
-I said--
Mark, chopper on the way.
Some woman choked on her Valentine's dinner.
I said I couldn't.
That I was doing something with you.
You dragged me into it.
-Mark, he's married.
-Yeah?
Well, so am I.
You're looking better, Jake.
Are you feeling better?
No.
Dr. Ross tells me you're a very good basketball player.
Yes, I am.
I'm probably better than he is, except he's older.
-Is he divorced?
-What?
My mom says divorced people have baggage.
Well, he isn't divorced.
Then he doesn't have baggage.
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly.
-He's faking.
-How can you know that?
Because he has that moany voice like when he wants to stay home from school.
-Could be appendicitis--
-He's done this before.
-Faked illness?
-No, tried to set me up with single men.
What?
He likes you.
I'm his mother, and he's stuck with me.
He thinks if he can get us to spend time together, we will naturally, you know....
-Well, that's....
-Obviously ridiculous.
Obviously.
And he's done this before?
I've been through 5 or 6 departments here alone.
Not to mention hardware stores.
Jake feels I should either be with a doctor or a man who knows his way around nuts and bolts.
So how do you suggest we handle this?
Let's cut him open.
The kid's faking it.
Dr. Ross, test results back on that Russian girl.
Oh, man.
Her white count's at 2,000.
You mean 20,000.
No.
Two.
And she has pneumonia.
She's got AIDS.
Mrs. Hayden?
Yes?
How did you get in here?
There is no starch.
No.
No.
You know what?
We're out of starch.
But I need it for Joe's uniform.
Okay.
Just sit right here.
You know what?
I'm going to....
I'm gonna have to take a look at this arm.
I don't suppose you remember if you're allergic to lidocaine or Novocaine?
Some of the wives don't bother.
Okay.
Well, we're just gonna have to jump in here.
Joe likes his uniform and his collar crisp.
Would you like me to iron your uniform?
-All right.
-That'd be great.
How can she do that?
-It doesn't matter.
-It does to Tatiana.
The situation is what it is.
We'll do what we can.
Well, it isn't much.
We bring down her fever and kick her out?
-Children and Family Services will--
-She's got AIDS!
She doesn't speak English.
She's barely a candidate as a foster child.
-So what do you suggest that we do?
-Anything else.
There isn't anything else.
I know.
You know, these patients come in here for an hour, maybe two maybe a day.
We treat them fast, barely learn their names and then send them home.
Which is usually what they want.
They usually have a home to go to.
Dr. Ross, you've still got those chickenpox in 3.
Fine, Jerry.
I'm sorry that the person who was with you yesterday isn't here today.
And I'm sorry that none of us will be with you tomorrow.
And I'm glad you can't understand what's happening to you.
Neither can l.
Malik, move these hearts!
Let's go!
We're going to Trauma 2.
-What do you got?
-Anaphylaxis.
My wife's allergic to shrimp and scallops and all that stuff.
Susan, this is Mr. Goodwin.
This is Dr. Lewis.
We didn't order it.
It must've been that appetizer.
We'll take care of her.
You need to wait outside.
It happened once before.
Her throat swelled up, but not like this.
--two, three.
Lydia, show Mr. Goodwin where he can wait.
Come on, Mr. Goodwin.
Upper airway obstruction with stridor.
-She's hypotensive.
-BP's 45 and palp.
I'll intubate.
Haleh, get a 6.5 and prep for a crike just in case.
Epi, one to 1 0,000, two cc's, IV push.
This is hopeless.
Throat's completely swollen.
Let's crike her.
Grab a trach tube.
Benadryl, IV 50 milligrams and cimetidine, IV 300 milligrams.
Pressure's stabilizing, 1 00 over 80.
Pulse ox 96.
-It's peaking up.
-Nice.
Thank you.
Let's start an epi drip, one milligram in 250 at 1 0 mics per minute.
Keep her on the antihistamines until the swelling comes down.
Oh, God!
Mark, Susan!
Get over here!
What happened?
She was stable.
-Get her husband in here now!
-Her pressure's crashing.
We gotta scope her.
Did I perforate the esophagus?
-You couldn't have.
-What'd I do wrong?
Nothing.
Get a CBC.
Type and cross six units lytes, LFTs, amylase.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-What happened?
-Lydia, call for O-neg.
-Has your wife been vomiting recently?
-No.
-Does she have any history of ulcer?
-No.
She has bleeding varices.
SP, tube.
Varices?
What the hell is this?
Mr. Goodwin, is your wife an alcoholic?
Is she?
All right.
Get the catcher's mask.
Inflate the balloon to 200cc's.
It's in the stomach.
Okay, inflate the esophageal balloon to 40 millimeters.
It's stopped.
Great pickup, Susan.
Well, her fever's back down to 1 00.
You're feeling better, aren't you?
Will you keep an eye on her for me?
Thanks.
-I should've gone into real estate.
-That bad, huh?
-I got off two hours ago.
-Me too.
Can I borrow a pen?
Well, we gotta do something.
I don't want Kayson to think you're a liar.
-Carol, you wanna come?
-I'm on tonight.
-Sorry.
-Bye.
She's very ill.
I know.
You can't take her home tonight.
I know.
After this morning, I'm not sure you'll ever be able to take her home.
I don't want to.
Mrs. Hayden?
I guess you found the starch.
When I found out that I could adopt Tatiana I bought a Russian-English dictionary.
Never got much beyond hello and goodbye.
-Mrs.
Hall--
-Can you imagine anything worse than abandoning a child with AIDS?
No.
She was diagnosed last Thursday at St. John's.
Look, Mrs. Hall, or whatever your name is I'm not exactly sure why you're here.
But I'm not interested in listening to you say how sorry you are.
My husband died three years ago.
It was long and slow.
I was young.
You get through.
You go on.
I never really felt that loss until last week.
I never allowed myself to feel it.
Until I looked at Tatiana and I said "There it is."
I cannot I will not let myself get that close to someone and lose them again.
I brought her things.
I forgot how to say goodbye.
Mom?
Happy Valentine's Day.
-This is fun?
-This is fun.
It's 20 degrees out.
Okay, this is fun.
Did I tell you Morgenstern offered me a job as attending next year?
What?
No, you didn't tell me.
That's right, it was last week.
You weren't talking to me.
So, you were talking to me.
What'd you tell him?
-That I had to think about it.
-Oh, please.
Well, you know, there's Jennifer to consider.
Which I didn't.
What'd she say?
What do you think she said?
That, "l'm happy for you, Mark because I know this is what you really want"?
The "this is what you really want" part?
That's right.
Sounds bad.
It was.
So what are you gonna do?
I am going to skate.
Help, I need a doctor!
Is there a doctor?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Wendy.
I understand that she did it perfectly on the dog.
I'll fix it tomorrow.
I think I'm gonna stay home tomorrow.
Hang in there.
supplied by CoBeR coberus@go2.pl
She loves me.
She loves me not.
She loves me.
She loves me not.
I'm not a nurse-in-training, I'm a nurse-in-decorating.
Valentine's Day.
Can I help?
-Can't you just do it?
-Come on.
ER.
Carol, can you find Dr. Ross for Mrs. Hall?
Sure.
Mrs...?
-Hall.
Dr. Ross is the pediatrician?
-Yeah, what's the problem?
-Tatiana, she's very sick.
-You don't feel well?
She has a fever and a cough.
It just doesn't seem right.
-Okay, come right this way.
-Thank you.
Mark, it's 1 0:00.
So?
So you got in at 8, remember?
You weren't here overnight.
I was taking a nap. is there anything wrong with taking a nap?
Certainly not.
Stomach ache in 2, bounce-back migraine in 1 .
Can I give them an ETA?
Does that tickle?
-Temperature's 1 00.
-Does this hurt?
She doesn't speak much English.
She's Russian.
I adopted her in St. Petersburg 1 0 days ago.
-When did the fever start?
-l'd waited nearly six months.
Finally, all her paperwork was in order and medical certificates....
She really seemed fine.
-How long has she had the fever?
-Almost a week.
Start her on some oral amoxicillin.
She has some respiratory congestion and an ear infection which is causing the fever.
Don't worry, we'll take good care of her.
-Thank you, doctor.
-You're welcome.
Wendy, it's nice of you to volunteer to put those up.
I didn't volunteer.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Thanks, Lydia.
Here's another one for your stash.
Thank you.
Hello?
Amy.
Brooks.
-Wendy.
Patty.
-Come on.
-Who are these women?
-l don't remember.
-You're full of it.
-l don't remember meeting them.
Police!
Help!
Quick!
I hit him.
He dashed off the sidewalk chasing a ball.
I tried to swerve the car, but....
-Please!
-l'll page Benton.
Clear Trauma. 39-year-old male fell from the second-story balcony....
Watch yourself.
Mrs. Hall?
Mrs. Hall, wait.
Jerry, let me know when Mrs. Hall comes back.
-Sure.
-Thanks.
I tried to dodge him.
-Scalp laceration.
-l can't hear a thing.
He just came out of nowhere.
He's got a fractured left front radius?
Where do you want the iv?
-Please help him, okay, doc?
-Give me the bulletin.
-Car versus canine.
-Car versus canine?
Fractured left front leg.
Or maybe it's radius-ulna.
Nobody's sure how to take the BP.
A dog?
You called me down here for a dog?
The vet's office is sending someone over.
-What do we do?
-l'll name him Bill.
What are you, crazy?
You don't like the name Bill?
Call him whatever you want, but do it fast because little Bill here has stopped breathing.
He's one of God's creatures.
-l'm not a vet, Grabarsky.
-You could try.
No. I'll be upstairs taking a gallbladder out of a Homo sapien.
-Did I miss anything?
-You were only gone ten seconds.
Poor little guy.
No collar, no tags.
-Must be lost, or a stray.
-l should've taken dog lab, not pig lab.
Digestive system, abdomen....
-Whoa, look at that spleen.
-Wow!
-Can we hurry this up, please?
-lV goes in what vein?
Try the large one.
Then give him some saline.
Somebody find out where the vet is.
Okay, here it is. lntubation.
It's like with a human, but when pushing back the tongue you can see the vocal cords.
-Thank you, Carter.
-Get an Ambu bag.
Let's intubate.
Pneumothorax, right there.
-A what?
-Collapsed lung.
Oh, my God!
Lydia, get a 20-gauge needle on a 60cc syringe with a three-way stopcock.
Which intercostal is it?
-Try the eighth, just below the heart.
-All right.
Bill lives.
All we have to do is sew up the lac and get a cast on him and he'll be chasing squirrels by the afternoon.
Carter, Chen.
I think you can take it from here.
Somebody call housekeeping.
Tell them to get a hose.
No problem.
That was pretty cool, the way you gave it mouth-to-mouth.
Thank you.
You know, they say the dog's mouth is the cleanest part of its body.
What do they say about its nose?
-She said nothing during the exam?
-Nothing.
She brings her in, then disappears leaves a fake number.
Why would she do that?
-l have no idea.
-How could somebody do that?
-We don't know the whole story.
-We can't reach her anywhere.
I'll move Tatiana out to Curtain 2 so she doesn't feel so alone back here.
Then I guess I'll have to call Children and Family Services.
-Thanks, Haleh.
-Sure.
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Tatiana....
My mother's Russian.
How do you say "hello"?
I'm Dr. Ross. I'm Doug.
I'm Doug.
So you do speak a little English.
So you don't.
You just stay right here.
We'll take care of you.
That was normal.
What do you mean?
Valentine's Day. lt's like full moons.
All the crazies come out.
-What's wrong with your neck?
-l slept on the sofa last night.
Sorry I asked.
You wanna tell me about it?
It's about five feet long.
It's got little blue flowers on it.
There's a spectacular stain on the right where Rachel did some projectile vomiting.
Still waiting on that stomach ache and migraine.
I am going to go get something to eat.
I'm loving this semi-foul mood of yours.
Yeah?
Well, imagine if we'd lost the dog.
See you.
Bye.
-Doug?
-"Do not steal.
Benton."
Anything good to eat in there?
You think Susan really wants this yogurt?
So you and Jen Valentining tonight?
She left for Milwaukee this morning.
-You?
-No, no.
Never.
I work the night shift Valentine's Day to avoid any possible dating conflicts.
-That sounds mature.
-l learned the hard way.
Dr. Ross, an ambulance is bringing a 1 7-year-old.
Crushed legs.
Some train accident.
Dr. Benton said to get you.
Thank you, Wendy.
Can you believe I said "thank you" for telling me I get to work on some kid whose legs have just been puréed?
Weird.
I thought you'd like some company.
is that okay?
Had to clear Trauma anyway.
Thanks.
Carol, I could use you in Curtain Area 3.
You know, Mark always says Valentine's Day is like the full moon.
The nut cases come out.
I never really thought about it.
Cheerleaders.
Cheerleaders?
On acid.
Sounds like Mark was right.
-Are you Kirk Driscoll?
-Sure.
I'm Dr. Lewis.
This is Nurse Hathaway.
All three girls ingested LSD?
It's not funny.
Are you sure it was straight LSD and not mixed?
Yeah. I got them right here if you wanna check.
-You laced chocolates?
-Pretty stupid, huh?
I only let them eat two each.
They could've had a seizure, kidney damage, gone into a coma.
We have to make sure there's no dangerous side effects.
You don't have to tell the cops, do you?
Yeah, we do.
And better yet, we get to tell your parents.
-Any Valentine's Day plans?
-Nope.
-No big date or anything?
-Nope.
So what was that about?
The flowers and the chocolates in the fridge?
-Oh, that.
-Yeah, that.
I met this pediatrician....
You what?
You what?
Hey, Peter!
What?
-What do you got?
-Michael Clifford, 1 7.
Lost a dare with a freight train.
Leg and head injuries.
Hypotensive, 80 over 60.
Fluid resuscitated 2,000cc's.
Brought the pressure up to 1 00.
Blood loss around three to four units.
Someone get on the horn with O.R.
Hang ten liters saline.
-Start him on Ancef, one gram, iv push.
-BP's dropped 80 over 40.
-Where's that O-neg?
-lt's coming.
Another blood Y-tubing.
Popliteal.
No dorsalis pedis on the left.
Let's get an angiogram.
Oh, God!
He's got my hand!
-Don't lose that airway.
-He's seizing!
He's breaking her hand!
Grab a bite block!
Bounce-back migraine in 6.
I already saw him.
No, you saw the one in 1 .
This is the one in 6.
Don't you guys work?
-Want one?
-No, thanks.
-You thought I was in a bad mood?
-What?
-Oh, my God.
-l gotta go.
-Don't you dare leave me.
-Excuse me.
-Dr.
Lewis?
-Dr.
Kayson.
Will you be mine?
Excuse me?
Happy Valentine's Day.
-Still 1 00.
-McGillis is here.
I'll be right back, okay?
Carol, how long is Sparky gonna be with us?
Until Grabarsky gets off duty tonight.
"One of God's creatures."
Hey, Deb.
Deb?
You all right?
What?
I said, are you okay?
Yeah.
Sure.
Very okay.
She left four hours ago.
Does that mean abandonment?
-lt does.
-Merits an investigation.
She dumps a child who's sick, speaks no English, has no clue-- lt's okay.
Tatiana needs to stay here at least 24 hours.
Longer if she doesn't get any better.
Then what happens?
Assuming Mom's still out of the picture Children and Family Services will find her a foster home.
There's nothing else we can do.
I have a lot of work to do.
I'm being released today.
You've made a remarkable recovery.
I couldn't have done it without you, Susan.
May I call you Susan?
Sure.
You said you needed to talk to me about something.
Every cardiologist should go through what I did.
Lying on that gurney, not knowing whether you're gonna live or die and seeing the face of this lovely, young resident hovering over you.
Well, I can understand how it must've been very scary for you.
It was terrifying at first.
But then, exhilarating.
Now I've got a whole new perspective on life.
My own and my patients' .
That's terrific.
I really should get back.
Have you thought about cardiology, Susan?
You'd be an excellent candidate.
And I'd like to help you.
Be a mentor of sorts.
-Thank you, Dr. Kayson--
-No, please call me Jack.
I'm still doing my ER residency.
I should just stick with that for now.
We should talk more about this another time.
That'd be fine.
Tonight, 8:00 dinner?
How's the pain?
I had a fifth of Demerol.
You mean 50 milligrams of Demerol?
I see that it's working.
Can you wiggle these fingers for me?
-l should stick with decorating.
-He crushed your hand pretty good.
You've got three metacarpal fractures, but I think you'll survive.
I'll get somebody to put a cast on.
-How's the boy?
-Boy?
The one who squeezed me got hit by that train.
He died up in O.R.
Dr. Greene, dueling meatpackers coming in.
About five minutes away.
-Carol?
-What?
-Whoa.
-Sorry.
-Are we not loving our job?
-l am not loving the limits of my job.
Watching that little girl sitting out there, completely abandoned.
Nothing we can do.
Maybe you need a change of pace.
How about a nice, greasy trauma?
Sunny-side up or over-easy?
I can offer you both.
Okay, but how long do I have to wait?
That's the beauty of it.
You don't.
-Happy Valentine's Day, Doris.
-Likewise, Dr. Greene.
Meet Mr. Lorenzo Renzetti.
45, sturdy, aluminum meat hook firmly embedded in his bicep.
How's that feel, Mr. Renzetti?
You can call me Lorenzo.
I don't know, it's not so bad.
That's good, because it sure looks bad.
Started one lV.
BP is 1 40 over 90.
Pulse 96, resp's 1 6.
Good distal pulses, normal cap refill.
Defensive lacerations on both arms.
Mr. Renzetti, we're gonna take care of you.
All right, we're gonna move him.
All right, on my count.
-One--
-Watch your back.
Why don't you just scoot over.
Don't let the gurney roll.
Okay.
Good.
I got you.
Doris, you said this was a twofer.
Second guy, second unit.
I drove circles around him.
Let's hand some Ancef, one gram, iv piggyback and let's update Lorenzo's tetanus.
I'll start a chart.
I had that when I went to the Caribbean.
-How was it?
-lt was all right. lt rained a lot.
Want a chest film plus humerus films?
Call Radiology and get a portable.
Lorenzo.
Just lay down, okay?
Take it easy.
They should've brought Paulie here first.
Who's Paulie?
My stupid kid.
He made a crack about his mother.
I didn't want to fight, but he kept coming at me.
Move your thumb.
-Now your wrist.
-He kept jabbing me.
You shouldn't disrespect your mother.
Where is the son of a bitch?
I'm sure he's on his way.
He'd better be, because he's in worse shape than I am.
We're gonna take this out in surgery.
There he is!
Hey, Paulie!
I'm over here, son.
Your dad's over here.
You okay?
Son?
Carol, come with me.
He's in fib.
Paddles.
I'm right here, son.
I'm right here.
is he all right?
-Two hundred.
-Charging.
Clear.
-Three hundred.
-Charging.
-ls he okay?
-Clear.
He's okay, right?
-Damn it!
360.
-Charging.
He needs more volume.
It's gonna be okay.
You'll be fine.
Exam 2?
Okay, here we go.
This way, you guys.
There you go.
We'll be with you in just a second.
You have to admit, they're pretty cute.
They've been spray-painted, giving them hives.
Children with hives are not cute.
So, Peter about the flower and candy in the refrigerator?
Are you gonna make me guess who they're for?
They're for my mother.
Really.
Excuse me, where is Exam Room 1 ?
-Thanks for moving her.
-Oh, sure.
She insisted on bringing Bill.
Hello and goodbye.
That and ten other words is the extent of my Russian.
They're kind of perfect together.
No idea where they are or what they're doing.
-Neither one of them seem to mind.
-The dog gets to go home with Grabarsky.
Maybe her mom will come back.
I don't think "mom" is the right word.
Carter, Dr. Ross needs you to help with some kids in Exam 2.
How do you say goodbye?
Tell Dr. Ross I need him now.
Hey, Deb.
Are you Wendy Goldman?
Yes Deb.
I'm Deborah Chen.
I know that.
I had the hardest time finding you.
I'm gonna be doing your cast.
-How long was he in the hot tub?
-40 minutes.
-Any wine?
-Champagne.
-How much?
-A little.
A couple of bottles.
-lt's Valentine's Day.
-Eddie wanted something special.
-He got nauseous.
-Then he threw up.
-lt was horrible.
-Then he sank.
We went under.
Both of us pulled him up.
Ran into the house.
Called 91 1 .
-You did the right thing.
-We'll take it from here.
We're gonna take his temperature now.
Rectally.
You might wanna wait outside.
We'll be right back, okay?
You still think it's upper respiratory?
Now that she's hydrated, I heard rales.
Could be pneumonia or a foreign virus we know nothing about.
Fever's spiked up to 1 04.
I'm gonna put a rush on that x-ray.
-You give her acetaminophen?
-Yeah. 1 5 per kilo.
All the times my mom tried to teach me Russian.
All the times she yelled at me in Russian.
You deserved it.
Doctor B.
Mrs. Hayden, 85, fell and cut her arm.
She's in the Suture Room, and she's a tad senile.
Give it to Carter.
He's busy taking care of six small, red children.
Where's the other one?
Deb Chen?
Doing a cast.
All right, have her wait.
is Dr. Ross here?
What's wrong?
I'm Jake Leeds.
I need to talk to Dr. Ross.
Look, he's very busy right now.
I can find someone else for you.
What's wrong?
My side and my stomach.
It really hurts.
We're gonna take him to Curtain 2.
Call his mom, Diane Leeds, up in Risk Management.
-Sure, Dr. Ross.
-Carol.
Come on, buddy.
All right, what's wrong?
Where's it hurt?
Here we go.
It started here in my stomach and now it feels like it's over here.
Like this?
There. lt hurts there.
Any vomiting or nausea?
-Right after gym.
-Temp's normal.
Okay, let's get a CBC, urinalysis and set him up for an ultrasound.
All right, Jake, hang tight.
We're gonna check you out.
-Where are we gonna put him?
-Admitting him straight upstairs.
Haleh, could you tell those two hookers that their friend is doing fine?
I think they'd rather talk to a doctor.
Tell them I'll meet them in the waiting room.
So what was that with Kayson?
What?
Oh, you know, he just wanted to tell me that he was fine, thank me.
Nice try.
I saw the bouquet.
Oh, God.
Did anyone else?
It was so embarrassing.
He just gave you flowers. lt's not like he asked you out or anything.
-He did?
-Dinner, tonight.
-What'd you say?
-l said--
Mark, chopper on the way.
Some woman choked on her Valentine's dinner.
I said I couldn't.
That I was doing something with you.
You dragged me into it.
-Mark, he's married.
-Yeah?
Well, so am I.
You're looking better, Jake.
Are you feeling better?
No.
Dr. Ross tells me you're a very good basketball player.
Yes, I am.
I'm probably better than he is, except he's older.
-ls he divorced?
-What?
My mom says divorced people have baggage.
Well, he isn't divorced.
Then he doesn't have baggage.
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly.
-He's faking.
-How can you know that?
Because he has that moany voice like when he wants to stay home from school.
-Could be appendicitis--
-He's done this before.
-Faked illness?
-No, tried to set me up with single men.
What?
He likes you. I'm his mother, and he's stuck with me.
He thinks if he can get us to spend time together, we will naturally, you know....
-Well, that's....
-Obviously ridiculous.
Obviously.
And he's done this before?
I've been through 5 or 6 departments here alone.
Not to mention hardware stores.
Jake feels I should either be with a doctor or a man who knows his way around nuts and bolts.
So how do you suggest we handle this?
Let's cut him open.
The kid's faking it.
Dr. Ross, test results back on that Russian girl.
Oh, man.
Her white count's at 2,000.
You mean 20,000.
No.
Two.
And she has pneumonia.
She's got aids.
Mrs. Hayden?
Yes?
How did you get in here?
There is no starch.
No.
No.
You know what?
We're out of starch.
But I need it for Joe's uniform.
Okay.
Just sit right here.
You know what?
I'm going to....
l'm gonna have to take a look at this arm.
I don't suppose you remember if you're allergic to lidocaine or Novocaine?
Some of the wives don't bother.
Okay.
Well, we're just gonna have to jump in here.
Joe likes his uniform and his collar crisp.
Would you like me to iron your uniform?
-All right.
-That'd be great.
How can she do that?
-lt doesn't matter.
-lt does to Tatiana.
The situation is what it is.
We'll do what we can.
Well, it isn't much.
We bring down her fever and kick her out?
-Children and Family Services will--
-She's got aids!
She doesn't speak English.
She's barely a candidate as a foster child.
-So what do you suggest that we do?
-Anything else.
There isn't anything else.
I know.
You know, these patients come in here for an hour, maybe two maybe a day.
We treat them fast, barely learn their names and then send them home.
Which is usually what they want.
They usually have a home to go to.
Dr. Ross, you've still got those chickenpox in 3.
Fine, Jerry.
I'm sorry that the person who was with you yesterday isn't here today.
And I'm sorry that none of us will be with you tomorrow.
And I'm glad you can't understand what's happening to you.
Neither can I.
Malik, move these hearts!
Let's go!
We're going to Trauma 2.
-What do you got?
-Anaphylaxis.
My wife's allergic to shrimp and scallops and all that stuff.
Susan, this is Mr. Goodwin.
This is Dr. Lewis.
We didn't order it.
It must've been that appetizer.
We'll take care of her.
You need to wait outside.
It happened once before.
Her throat swelled up, but not like this.
--two, three.
Lydia, show Mr. Goodwin where he can wait.
Come on, Mr. Goodwin.
Upper airway obstruction with stridor.
-She's hypotensive.
-BP's 45 and palp.
I'll intubate.
Haleh, get a 6.5 and prep for a crike just in case.
Epi, one to 1 0,000, two cc's, iv push.
This is hopeless.
Throat's completely swollen.
Let's crike her.
Grab a trach tube.
Benadryl, iv 50 milligrams and cimetidine, iv 300 milligrams.
Pressure's stabilizing, 1 00 over 80.
Pulse ox 96.
-lt's peaking up.
-Nice.
Thank you.
Let's start an epi drip, one milligram in 250 at 1 0 mics per minute.
Keep her on the antihistamines until the swelling comes down.
Oh, God!
Mark, Susan!
Get over here!
What happened?
She was stable.
-Get her husband in here now!
-Her pressure's crashing.
We gotta scope her.
Did I perforate the esophagus?
-You couldn't have.
-What'd I do wrong?
Nothing.
Get a CBC.
Type and cross six units lytes, LFTs, amylase.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-What happened?
-Lydia, call for O-neg.
-Has your wife been vomiting recently?
-No.
-Does she have any history of ulcer?
-No.
She has bleeding varices.
SP, tube.
Varices?
What the hell is this?
Mr. Goodwin, is your wife an alcoholic?
is she?
All right.
Get the catcher's mask.
Inflate the balloon to 200cc's.
It's in the stomach.
Okay, inflate the esophageal balloon to 40 millimeters.
It's stopped.
Great pickup, Susan.
Well, her fever's back down to 1 00.
You're feeling better, aren't you?
Will you keep an eye on her for me?
Thanks.
-l should've gone into real estate.
-That bad, huh?
-l got off two hours ago.
-Me too.
Can I borrow a pen?
Well, we gotta do something.
I don't want Kayson to think you're a liar.
-Carol, you wanna come?
-l'm on tonight.
-Sorry.
-Bye.
She's very ill.
I know.
You can't take her home tonight.
I know.
After this morning, I'm not sure you'll ever be able to take her home.
I don't want to.
Mrs. Hayden?
I guess you found the starch.
When I found out that I could adopt Tatiana I bought a Russian-English dictionary.
Never got much beyond hello and goodbye.
-Mrs.
Hall--
-Can you imagine anything worse than abandoning a child with aids?
No.
She was diagnosed last Thursday at St. John's.
Look, Mrs. Hall, or whatever your name is I'm not exactly sure why you're here.
But I'm not interested in listening to you say how sorry you are.
My husband died three years ago.
It was long and slow.
I was young.
You get through.
You go on.
I never really felt that loss until last week.
I never allowed myself to feel it.
Until I looked at Tatiana and I said "There it is."
I cannot I will not let myself get that close to someone and lose them again.
I brought her things.
I forgot how to say goodbye.
Mom?
Happy Valentine's Day.
-This is fun?
-This is fun.
It's 20 degrees out.
Okay, this is fun.
Did I tell you Morgenstern offered me a job as attending next year?
What?
No, you didn't tell me.
That's right, it was last week.
You weren't talking to me.
So, you were talking to me.
What'd you tell him?
-That I had to think about it.
-Oh, please.
Well, you know, there's Jennifer to consider.
Which I didn't.
What'd she say?
What do you think she said?
That, "l'm happy for you, Mark because I know this is what you really want"?
The "this is what you really want" part?
That's right.
Sounds bad.
It was.
So what are you gonna do?
I am going to skate.
Help, I need a doctor!
is there a doctor?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wendy.
I understand that she did it perfectly on the dog.
I'll fix it tomorrow.
I think I'm gonna stay home tomorrow.
Hang in there.
She loves me.
She loves me not.
She loves me.
She loves me not.
I'm not a nurse-in-training, I'm a nurse-in-decorating.
Valentine's Day.
Can I help?
-Can't you just do it?
-Come on.
ER.
Carol, can you find Dr. Ross for Mrs. Hall?
Sure.
Mrs...?
-Hall.
Dr. Ross is the pediatrician?
-Yeah, what's the problem?
-Tatiana, she's very sick.
-You don't feel well?
She has a fever and a cough.
It just doesn't seem right.
-Okay, come right this way.
-Thank you.
Mark, it's 1 0:00.
So?
So you got in at 8, remember?
You weren't here overnight.
I was taking a nap. is there anything wrong with taking a nap?
Certainly not.
Stomach ache in 2, bounce-back migraine in 1 .
Can I give them an ETA?
Does that tickle?
-Temperature's 1 00.
-Does this hurt?
She doesn't speak much English.
She's Russian.
I adopted her in St. Petersburg 1 0 days ago.
-When did the fever start?
-l'd waited nearly six months.
Finally, all her paperwork was in order and medical certificates....
She really seemed fine.
-How long has she had the fever?
-Almost a week.
Start her on some oral amoxicillin.
She has some respiratory congestion and an ear infection which is causing the fever.
Don't worry, we'll take good care of her.
-Thank you, doctor.
-You're welcome.
Wendy, it's nice of you to volunteer to put those up.
I didn't volunteer.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Thanks, Lydia.
Here's another one for your stash.
Thank you.
Hello?
Amy.
Brooks.
-Wendy.
Patty.
-Come on.
-Who are these women?
-l don't remember.
-You're full of it.
-l don't remember meeting them.
Police!
Help!
Quick!
I hit him.
He dashed off the sidewalk chasing a ball.
I tried to swerve the car, but....
-Please!
-l'll page Benton.
Clear Trauma. 39-year-old male fell from the second-story balcony....
Watch yourself.
Mrs. Hall?
Mrs. Hall, wait.
Jerry, let me know when Mrs. Hall comes back.
-Sure.
-Thanks.
I tried to dodge him.
-Scalp laceration.
-l can't hear a thing.
He just came out of nowhere.
He's got a fractured left front radius?
Where do you want the iv?
-Please help him, okay, doc?
-Give me the bulletin.
-Car versus canine.
-Car versus canine?
Fractured left front leg.
Or maybe it's radius-ulna.
Nobody's sure how to take the BP.
A dog?
You called me down here for a dog?
The vet's office is sending someone over.
-What do we do?
-l'll name him Bill.
What are you, crazy?
You don't like the name Bill?
Call him whatever you want, but do it fast because little Bill here has stopped breathing.
He's one of God's creatures.
-l'm not a vet, Grabarsky.
-You could try.
No. I'll be upstairs taking a gallbladder out of a Homo sapien.
-Did I miss anything?
-You were only gone ten seconds.
Poor little guy.
No collar, no tags.
-Must be lost, or a stray.
-l should've taken dog lab, not pig lab.
Digestive system, abdomen....
-Whoa, look at that spleen.
-Wow!
-Can we hurry this up, please?
-lV goes in what vein?
Try the large one.
Then give him some saline.
Somebody find out where the vet is.
Okay, here it is. lntubation.
It's like with a human, but when pushing back the tongue you can see the vocal cords.
-Thank you, Carter.
-Get an Ambu bag.
Let's intubate.
Pneumothorax, right there.
-A what?
-Collapsed lung.
Oh, my God!
Lydia, get a 20-gauge needle on a 60cc syringe with a three-way stopcock.
Which intercostal is it?
-Try the eighth, just below the heart.
-All right.
Bill lives.
All we have to do is sew up the lac and get a cast on him and he'll be chasing squirrels by the afternoon.
Carter, Chen.
I think you can take it from here.
Somebody call housekeeping.
Tell them to get a hose.
No problem.
That was pretty cool, the way you gave it mouth-to-mouth.
Thank you.
You know, they say the dog's mouth is the cleanest part of its body.
What do they say about its nose?
-She said nothing during the exam?
-Nothing.
She brings her in, then disappears leaves a fake number.
Why would she do that?
-l have no idea.
-How could somebody do that?
-We don't know the whole story.
-We can't reach her anywhere.
I'll move Tatiana out to Curtain 2 so she doesn't feel so alone back here.
Then I guess I'll have to call Children and Family Services.
-Thanks, Haleh.
-Sure.
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Tatiana....
My mother's Russian.
How do you say "hello"?
I'm Dr. Ross. I'm Doug.
I'm Doug.
So you do speak a little English.
So you don't.
You just stay right here.
We'll take care of you.
That was normal.
What do you mean?
Valentine's Day. lt's like full moons.
All the crazies come out.
-What's wrong with your neck?
-l slept on the sofa last night.
Sorry I asked.
You wanna tell me about it?
It's about five feet long.
It's got little blue flowers on it.
There's a spectacular stain on the right where Rachel did some projectile vomiting.
Still waiting on that stomach ache and migraine.
I am going to go get something to eat.
I'm loving this semi-foul mood of yours.
Yeah?
Well, imagine if we'd lost the dog.
See you.
Bye.
-Doug?
-"Do not steal.
Benton."
Anything good to eat in there?
You think Susan really wants this yogurt?
So you and Jen Valentining tonight?
She left for Milwaukee this morning.
-You?
-No, no.
Never.
I work the night shift Valentine's Day to avoid any possible dating conflicts.
-That sounds mature.
-l learned the hard way.
Dr. Ross, an ambulance is bringing a 1 7-year-old.
Crushed legs.
Some train accident.
Dr. Benton said to get you.
Thank you, Wendy.
Can you believe I said "thank you" for telling me I get to work on some kid whose legs have just been puréed?
Weird.
I thought you'd like some company.
is that okay?
Had to clear Trauma anyway.
Thanks.
Carol, I could use you in Curtain Area 3.
You know, Mark always says Valentine's Day is like the full moon.
The nut cases come out.
I never really thought about it.
Cheerleaders.
Cheerleaders?
On acid.
Sounds like Mark was right.
-Are you Kirk Driscoll?
-Sure.
I'm Dr. Lewis.
This is Nurse Hathaway.
All three girls ingested LSD?
It's not funny.
Are you sure it was straight LSD and not mixed?
Yeah. I got them right here if you wanna check.
-You laced chocolates?
-Pretty stupid, huh?
I only let them eat two each.
They could've had a seizure, kidney damage, gone into a coma.
We have to make sure there's no dangerous side effects.
You don't have to tell the cops, do you?
Yeah, we do.
And better yet, we get to tell your parents.
-Any Valentine's Day plans?
-Nope.
-No big date or anything?
-Nope.
So what was that about?
The flowers and the chocolates in the fridge?
-Oh, that.
-Yeah, that.
I met this pediatrician....
You what?
You what?
Hey, Peter!
What?
-What do you got?
-Michael Clifford, 1 7.
Lost a dare with a freight train.
Leg and head injuries.
Hypotensive, 80 over 60.
Fluid resuscitated 2,000cc's.
Brought the pressure up to 1 00.
Blood loss around three to four units.
Someone get on the horn with O.R.
Hang ten liters saline.
-Start him on Ancef, one gram, iv push.
-BP's dropped 80 over 40.
-Where's that O-neg?
-lt's coming.
Another blood Y-tubing.
Popliteal.
No dorsalis pedis on the left.
Let's get an angiogram.
Oh, God!
He's got my hand!
-Don't lose that airway.
-He's seizing!
He's breaking her hand!
Grab a bite block!
Bounce-back migraine in 6.
I already saw him.
No, you saw the one in 1 .
This is the one in 6.
Don't you guys work?
-Want one?
-No, thanks.
-You thought I was in a bad mood?
-What?
-Oh, my God.
-l gotta go.
-Don't you dare leave me.
-Excuse me.
-Dr.
Lewis?
-Dr.
Kayson.
Will you be mine?
Excuse me?
Happy Valentine's Day.
-Still 1 00.
-McGillis is here.
I'll be right back, okay?
Carol, how long is Sparky gonna be with us?
Until Grabarsky gets off duty tonight.
"One of God's creatures."
Hey, Deb.
Deb?
You all right?
What?
I said, are you okay?
Yeah.
Sure.
Very okay.
She left four hours ago.
Does that mean abandonment?
-lt does.
-Merits an investigation.
She dumps a child who's sick, speaks no English, has no clue-- lt's okay.
Tatiana needs to stay here at least 24 hours.
Longer if she doesn't get any better.
Then what happens?
Assuming Mom's still out of the picture Children and Family Services will find her a foster home.
There's nothing else we can do.
I have a lot of work to do.
I'm being released today.
You've made a remarkable recovery.
I couldn't have done it without you, Susan.
May I call you Susan?
Sure.
You said you needed to talk to me about something.
Every cardiologist should go through what I did.
Lying on that gurney, not knowing whether you're gonna live or die and seeing the face of this lovely, young resident hovering over you.
Well, I can understand how it must've been very scary for you.
It was terrifying at first.
But then, exhilarating.
Now I've got a whole new perspective on life.
My own and my patients' .
That's terrific.
I really should get back.
Have you thought about cardiology, Susan?
You'd be an excellent candidate.
And I'd like to help you.
Be a mentor of sorts.
-Thank you, Dr. Kayson--
-No, please call me Jack.
I'm still doing my ER residency.
I should just stick with that for now.
We should talk more about this another time.
That'd be fine.
Tonight, 8:00 dinner?
How's the pain?
I had a fifth of Demerol.
You mean 50 milligrams of Demerol?
I see that it's working.
Can you wiggle these fingers for me?
-l should stick with decorating.
-He crushed your hand pretty good.
You've got three metacarpal fractures, but I think you'll survive.
I'll get somebody to put a cast on.
-How's the boy?
-Boy?
The one who squeezed me got hit by that train.
He died up in O.R.
Dr. Greene, dueling meatpackers coming in.
About five minutes away.
-Carol?
-What?
-Whoa.
-Sorry.
-Are we not loving our job?
-l am not loving the limits of my job.
Watching that little girl sitting out there, completely abandoned.
Nothing we can do.
Maybe you need a change of pace.
How about a nice, greasy trauma?
Sunny-side up or over-easy?
I can offer you both.
Okay, but how long do I have to wait?
That's the beauty of it.
You don't.
-Happy Valentine's Day, Doris.
-Likewise, Dr. Greene.
Meet Mr. Lorenzo Renzetti.
45, sturdy, aluminum meat hook firmly embedded in his bicep.
How's that feel, Mr. Renzetti?
You can call me Lorenzo.
I don't know, it's not so bad.
That's good, because it sure looks bad.
Started one lV.
BP is 1 40 over 90.
Pulse 96, resp's 1 6.
Good distal pulses, normal cap refill.
Defensive lacerations on both arms.
Mr. Renzetti, we're gonna take care of you.
All right, we're gonna move him.
All right, on my count.
-One--
-Watch your back.
Why don't you just scoot over.
Don't let the gurney roll.
Okay.
Good.
I got you.
Doris, you said this was a twofer.
Second guy, second unit.
I drove circles around him.
Let's hand some Ancef, one gram, iv piggyback and let's update Lorenzo's tetanus.
I'll start a chart.
I had that when I went to the Caribbean.
-How was it?
-lt was all right. lt rained a lot.
Want a chest film plus humerus films?
Call Radiology and get a portable.
Lorenzo.
Just lay down, okay?
Take it easy.
They should've brought Paulie here first.
Who's Paulie?
My stupid kid.
He made a crack about his mother.
I didn't want to fight, but he kept coming at me.
Move your thumb.
-Now your wrist.
-He kept jabbing me.
You shouldn't disrespect your mother.
Where is the son of a bitch?
I'm sure he's on his way.
He'd better be, because he's in worse shape than I am.
We're gonna take this out in surgery.
There he is!
Hey, Paulie!
I'm over here, son.
Your dad's over here.
You okay?
Son?
Carol, come with me.
He's in fib.
Paddles.
I'm right here, son.
I'm right here.
is he all right?
-Two hundred.
-Charging.
Clear.
-Three hundred.
-Charging.
-ls he okay?
-Clear.
He's okay, right?
-Damn it!
360.
-Charging.
He needs more volume.
It's gonna be okay.
You'll be fine.
Exam 2?
Okay, here we go.
This way, you guys.
There you go.
We'll be with you in just a second.
You have to admit, they're pretty cute.
They've been spray-painted, giving them hives.
Children with hives are not cute.
So, Peter about the flower and candy in the refrigerator?
Are you gonna make me guess who they're for?
They're for my mother.
Really.
Excuse me, where is Exam Room 1 ?
-Thanks for moving her.
-Oh, sure.
She insisted on bringing Bill.
Hello and goodbye.
That and ten other words is the extent of my Russian.
They're kind of perfect together.
No idea where they are or what they're doing.
-Neither one of them seem to mind.
-The dog gets to go home with Grabarsky.
Maybe her mom will come back.
I don't think "mom" is the right word.
Carter, Dr. Ross needs you to help with some kids in Exam 2.
How do you say goodbye?
Tell Dr. Ross I need him now.
Hey, Deb.
Are you Wendy Goldman?
Yes Deb.
I'm Deborah Chen.
I know that.
I had the hardest time finding you.
I'm gonna be doing your cast.
-How long was he in the hot tub?
-40 minutes.
-Any wine?
-Champagne.
-How much?
-A little.
A couple of bottles.
-lt's Valentine's Day.
-Eddie wanted something special.
-He got nauseous.
-Then he threw up.
-lt was horrible.
-Then he sank.
We went under.
Both of us pulled him up.
Ran into the house.
Called 91 1 .
-You did the right thing.
-We'll take it from here.
We're gonna take his temperature now.
Rectally.
You might wanna wait outside.
We'll be right back, okay?
You still think it's upper respiratory?
Now that she's hydrated, I heard rales.
Could be pneumonia or a foreign virus we know nothing about.
Fever's spiked up to 1 04.
I'm gonna put a rush on that x-ray.
-You give her acetaminophen?
-Yeah. 1 5 per kilo.
All the times my mom tried to teach me Russian.
All the times she yelled at me in Russian.
You deserved it.
Doctor B.
Mrs. Hayden, 85, fell and cut her arm.
She's in the Suture Room, and she's a tad senile.
Give it to Carter.
He's busy taking care of six small, red children.
Where's the other one?
Deb Chen?
Doing a cast.
All right, have her wait.
is Dr. Ross here?
What's wrong?
I'm Jake Leeds.
I need to talk to Dr. Ross.
Look, he's very busy right now.
I can find someone else for you.
What's wrong?
My side and my stomach.
It really hurts.
We're gonna take him to Curtain 2.
Call his mom, Diane Leeds, up in Risk Management.
-Sure, Dr. Ross.
-Carol.
Come on, buddy.
All right, what's wrong?
Where's it hurt?
Here we go.
It started here in my stomach and now it feels like it's over here.
Like this?
There. lt hurts there.
Any vomiting or nausea?
-Right after gym.
-Temp's normal.
Okay, let's get a CBC, urinalysis and set him up for an ultrasound.
All right, Jake, hang tight.
We're gonna check you out.
-Where are we gonna put him?
-Admitting him straight upstairs.
Haleh, could you tell those two hookers that their friend is doing fine?
I think they'd rather talk to a doctor.
Tell them I'll meet them in the waiting room.
So what was that with Kayson?
What?
Oh, you know, he just wanted to tell me that he was fine, thank me.
Nice try.
I saw the bouquet.
Oh, God.
Did anyone else?
It was so embarrassing.
He just gave you flowers. lt's not like he asked you out or anything.
-He did?
-Dinner, tonight.
-What'd you say?
-l said--
Mark, chopper on the way.
Some woman choked on her Valentine's dinner.
I said I couldn't.
That I was doing something with you.
You dragged me into it.
-Mark, he's married.
-Yeah?
Well, so am I.
You're looking better, Jake.
Are you feeling better?
No.
Dr. Ross tells me you're a very good basketball player.
Yes, I am.
I'm probably better than he is, except he's older.
-ls he divorced?
-What?
My mom says divorced people have baggage.
Well, he isn't divorced.
Then he doesn't have baggage.
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly.
-He's faking.
-How can you know that?
Because he has that moany voice like when he wants to stay home from school.
-Could be appendicitis--
-He's done this before.
-Faked illness?
-No, tried to set me up with single men.
What?
He likes you. I'm his mother, and he's stuck with me.
He thinks if he can get us to spend time together, we will naturally, you know....
-Well, that's....
-Obviously ridiculous.
Obviously.
And he's done this before?
I've been through 5 or 6 departments here alone.
Not to mention hardware stores.
Jake feels I should either be with a doctor or a man who knows his way around nuts and bolts.
So how do you suggest we handle this?
Let's cut him open.
The kid's faking it.
Dr. Ross, test results back on that Russian girl.
Oh, man.
Her white count's at 2,000.
You mean 20,000.
No.
Two.
And she has pneumonia.
She's got aids.
Mrs. Hayden?
Yes?
How did you get in here?
There is no starch.
No.
No.
You know what?
We're out of starch.
But I need it for Joe's uniform.
Okay.
Just sit right here.
You know what?
I'm going to....
l'm gonna have to take a look at this arm.
I don't suppose you remember if you're allergic to lidocaine or Novocaine?
Some of the wives don't bother.
Okay.
Well, we're just gonna have to jump in here.
Joe likes his uniform and his collar crisp.
Would you like me to iron your uniform?
-All right.
-That'd be great.
How can she do that?
-lt doesn't matter.
-lt does to Tatiana.
The situation is what it is.
We'll do what we can.
Well, it isn't much.
We bring down her fever and kick her out?
-Children and Family Services will--
-She's got aids!
She doesn't speak English.
She's barely a candidate as a foster child.
-So what do you suggest that we do?
-Anything else.
There isn't anything else.
I know.
You know, these patients come in here for an hour, maybe two maybe a day.
We treat them fast, barely learn their names and then send them home.
Which is usually what they want.
They usually have a home to go to.
Dr. Ross, you've still got those chickenpox in 3.
Fine, Jerry.
I'm sorry that the person who was with you yesterday isn't here today.
And I'm sorry that none of us will be with you tomorrow.
And I'm glad you can't understand what's happening to you.
Neither can I.
Malik, move these hearts!
Let's go!
We're going to Trauma 2.
-What do you got?
-Anaphylaxis.
My wife's allergic to shrimp and scallops and all that stuff.
Susan, this is Mr. Goodwin.
This is Dr. Lewis.
We didn't order it.
It must've been that appetizer.
We'll take care of her.
You need to wait outside.
It happened once before.
Her throat swelled up, but not like this.
--two, three.
Lydia, show Mr. Goodwin where he can wait.
Come on, Mr. Goodwin.
Upper airway obstruction with stridor.
-She's hypotensive.
-BP's 45 and palp.
I'll intubate.
Haleh, get a 6.5 and prep for a crike just in case.
Epi, one to 1 0,000, two cc's, iv push.
This is hopeless.
Throat's completely swollen.
Let's crike her.
Grab a trach tube.
Benadryl, iv 50 milligrams and cimetidine, iv 300 milligrams.
Pressure's stabilizing, 1 00 over 80.
Pulse ox 96.
-lt's peaking up.
-Nice.
Thank you.
Let's start an epi drip, one milligram in 250 at 1 0 mics per minute.
Keep her on the antihistamines until the swelling comes down.
Oh, God!
Mark, Susan!
Get over here!
What happened?
She was stable.
-Get her husband in here now!
-Her pressure's crashing.
We gotta scope her.
Did I perforate the esophagus?
-You couldn't have.
-What'd I do wrong?
Nothing.
Get a CBC.
Type and cross six units lytes, LFTs, amylase.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-What happened?
-Lydia, call for O-neg.
-Has your wife been vomiting recently?
-No.
-Does she have any history of ulcer?
-No.
She has bleeding varices.
SP, tube.
Varices?
What the hell is this?
Mr. Goodwin, is your wife an alcoholic?
is she?
All right.
Get the catcher's mask.
Inflate the balloon to 200cc's.
It's in the stomach.
Okay, inflate the esophageal balloon to 40 millimeters.
It's stopped.
Great pickup, Susan.
Well, her fever's back down to 1 00.
You're feeling better, aren't you?
Will you keep an eye on her for me?
Thanks.
-l should've gone into real estate.
-That bad, huh?
-l got off two hours ago.
-Me too.
Can I borrow a pen?
Well, we gotta do something.
I don't want Kayson to think you're a liar.
-Carol, you wanna come?
-l'm on tonight.
-Sorry.
-Bye.
She's very ill.
I know.
You can't take her home tonight.
I know.
After this morning, I'm not sure you'll ever be able to take her home.
I don't want to.
Mrs. Hayden?
I guess you found the starch.
When I found out that I could adopt Tatiana I bought a Russian-English dictionary.
Never got much beyond hello and goodbye.
-Mrs.
Hall--
-Can you imagine anything worse than abandoning a child with aids?
No.
She was diagnosed last Thursday at St. John's.
Look, Mrs. Hall, or whatever your name is I'm not exactly sure why you're here.
But I'm not interested in listening to you say how sorry you are.
My husband died three years ago.
It was long and slow.
I was young.
You get through.
You go on.
I never really felt that loss until last week.
I never allowed myself to feel it.
Until I looked at Tatiana and I said "There it is."
I cannot I will not let myself get that close to someone and lose them again.
I brought her things.
I forgot how to say goodbye.
Mom?
Happy Valentine's Day.
-This is fun?
-This is fun.
It's 20 degrees out.
Okay, this is fun.
Did I tell you Morgenstern offered me a job as attending next year?
What?
No, you didn't tell me.
That's right, it was last week.
You weren't talking to me.
So, you were talking to me.
What'd you tell him?
-That I had to think about it.
-Oh, please.
Well, you know, there's Jennifer to consider.
Which I didn't.
What'd she say?
What do you think she said?
That, "l'm happy for you, Mark because I know this is what you really want"?
The "this is what you really want" part?
That's right.
Sounds bad.
It was.
So what are you gonna do?
I am going to skate.
Help, I need a doctor!
is there a doctor?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wendy.
I understand that she did it perfectly on the dog.
I'll fix it tomorrow.
I think I'm gonna stay home tomorrow.
Hang in there.
She loves me.
She loves me not.
She loves me.
She loves me not.
I'm not a nurse-in-training, I'm a nurse-in-decorating.
Valentine's Day.
Can I help?
- Can't you just do it?
- Come on.
ER.
Carol, can you find Dr. Ross for Mrs. Hall?
Sure.
Mrs?
- Hall.
Dr. Ross is the pediatrician?
- Yeah, what's the problem?
- Tatiana, she's very sick.
- You don't feel well?
She has a fever and a cough.
It just doesn't seem right.
- Okay, come right this way.
- Thank you.
Mark, it's 10:00.
So?
So you got in at 8, remember?
You weren't here overnight.
I was taking a nap.
Is there anything wrong with taking a nap?
Certainly not.
Stomach ache in 2, bounce-back migraine in 1.
Can I give them an ETA?
Does that tickle?
- Temperature's 100.
- Does this hurt?
She doesn't speak much English.
She's Russian.
I adopted her in St. Petersburg 10 days ago.
- When did the fever start?
- I'd waited nearly six months.
Finally, all her paperwork was in order and medical certificates...
She really seemed fine.
- How long has she had the fever?
- Almost a week.
Start her on some oral amoxicillin.
She has some respiratory congestion and an ear infection which is causing the fever.
Don't worry, we'll take good care of her.
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.
Wendy, it's nice of you to volunteer to put those up.
I didn't volunteer.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Thanks, Lydia.
Here's another one for your stash.
Thank you.
Hello?
Amy.
Brooks.
- Wendy.
Patty.
- Come on.
- Who are these women?
- I don't remember.
- You're full of it.
- I don't remember meeting them.
Police!
Help!
Quick!
I hit him.
He dashed off the sidewalk chasing a ball.
I tried to swerve the car, but...
- Please!
- I'll page Benton.
Clear Trauma. 39-year-old male fell from the second-story balcony...
Watch yourself.
Mrs. Hall?
Mrs. Hall, wait.
Jerry, let me know when Mrs. Hall comes back.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I tried to dodge him.
- Scalp laceration.
- I can't hear a thing.
He just came out of nowhere.
He's got a fractured left front radius?
Where do you want the IV?
- Please help him, okay, doc?
- Give me the bulletin.
- Car versus canine.
- Car versus canine?
Fractured left front leg.
Or maybe it's radius-ulna.
Nobody's sure how to take the BP.
A dog?
You called me down here for a dog?
The vet's office is sending someone over.
- What do we do?
- I'll name him Bill.
What are you, crazy?
You don't like the name Bill?
Call him whatever you want, but do it fast because little Bill here has stopped breathing.
He's one of God's creatures.
- I'm not a vet, Grabarsky.
- You could try.
No.
I'll be upstairs taking a gallbladder out of a Homo sapien.
- Did I miss anything?
- You were only gone ten seconds.
Poor little guy.
No collar, no tags.
- Must be lost, or a stray.
- I should've taken dog lab, not pig lab.
Digestive system, abdomen...
- Whoa, look at that spleen.
- Wow!
- Can we hurry this up, please?
- IV goes in what vein?
Try the large one.
Then give him some saline.
Somebody find out where the vet is.
Okay, here it is.
Intubation.
It's like with a human, but when pushing back the tongue you can see the vocal cords.
- Thank you, Carter.
- Get an Ambu bag.
Let's intubate.
Pneumothorax, right there.
- A what?
- Collapsed lung.
Oh, my God!
Lydia, get a 20-gauge needle on a 60cc syringe with a three-way stopcock.
Which intercostal is it?
- Try the eighth, just below the heart.
- All right.
Bill lives.
All we have to do is sew up the lac and get a cast on him and he'll be chasing squirrels by the afternoon.
Carter, Chen.
I think you can take it from here.
Somebody call housekeeping.
Tell them to get a hose.
No problem.
That was pretty cool, the way you gave it mouth-to-mouth.
Thank you.
You know, they say the dog's mouth is the cleanest part of its body.
What do they say about its nose?
- She said nothing during the exam?
- Nothing.
She brings her in, then disappears leaves a fake number.
Why would she do that?
- I have no idea.
- How could somebody do that?
- We don't know the whole story.
- We can't reach her anywhere.
I'll move Tatiana out to Curtain 2 so she doesn't feel so alone back here.
Then I guess I'll have to call Children and Family Services.
- Thanks, Haleh.
- Sure.
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Tatiana...
My mother's Russian.
How do you say "hello"?
I'm Dr. Ross.
I'm Doug.
I'm Doug.
So you do speak a little English.
So you don't.
You just stay right here.
We'll take care of you.
That was normal.
What do you mean?
Valentine's Day.
It's like full moons.
All the crazies come out.
- What's wrong with your neck?
- I slept on the sofa last night.
Sorry I asked.
You wanna tell me about it?
It's about five feet long.
It's got little blue flowers on it.
There's a spectacular stain on the right where Rachel did some projectile vomiting.
Still waiting on that stomach ache and migraine.
I am going to go get something to eat.
I'm loving this semi-foul mood of yours.
Yeah?
Well, imagine if we'd lost the dog.
See you.
Bye.
- Doug?
- "Do not steal.
Benton."
Anything good to eat in there?
You think Susan really wants this yogurt?
So you and Jen Valentining tonight?
She left for Milwaukee this morning.
- You?
- No, no.
Never.
I work the night shift Valentine's Day to avoid any possible dating conflicts.
- That sounds mature.
- I learned the hard way.
Dr. Ross, an ambulance is bringing a 17-year-old.
Crushed legs.
Some train accident.
Dr. Benton said to get you.
Thank you, Wendy.
Can you believe I said "thank you" for telling me I get to work on some kid whose legs have just been puréed?
Weird.
I thought you'd like some company.
Is that okay?
Had to clear Trauma anyway.
Thanks.
Carol, I could use you in Curtain Area 3.
You know, Mark always says Valentine's Day is like the full moon.
The nut cases come out.
I never really thought about it.
Cheerleaders.
Cheerleaders?
On acid.
Sounds like Mark was right.
- Are you Kirk Driscoll?
- Sure.
I'm Dr. Lewis.
This is Nurse Hathaway.
All three girls ingested LSD?
It's not funny.
Are you sure it was straight LSD and not mixed?
Yeah.
I got them right here if you wanna check.
- You laced chocolates?
- Pretty stupid, huh?
I only let them eat two each.
They could've had a seizure, kidney damage, gone into a coma.
We have to make sure there's no dangerous side effects.
You don't have to tell the cops, do you?
Yeah, we do.
And better yet, we get to tell your parents.
- Any Valentine's Day plans?
- Nope.
- No big date or anything?
- Nope.
So what was that about?
The flowers and the chocolates in the fridge?
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.
I met this pediatrician...
You what?
You what?
Hey, Peter!
What?
- What do you got?
- Michael Clifford, 17.
Lost a dare with a freight train.
Leg and head injuries.
Hypotensive, 80 over 60.
Fluid resuscitated 2,000cc's.
Brought the pressure up to 100.
Blood loss around three to four units.
Someone get on the horn with O.R.
Hang ten liters saline.
- Start him on Ancef, one gram, IV push.
- BP's dropped 80 over 40.
- Where's that O-neg?
- It's coming.
Another blood Y-tubing.
Popliteal.
No dorsalis pedis on the left.
Let's get an angiogram.
Oh, God!
He's got my hand!
- Don't lose that airway.
- He's seizing!
He's breaking her hand!
Grab a bite block!
Bounce-back migraine in 6.
I already saw him.
No, you saw the one in 1.
This is the one in 6.
Don't you guys work?
- Want one?
- No, thanks.
- You thought I was in a bad mood?
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta go.
- Don't you dare leave me.
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Lewis?
- Dr. Kayson.
Will you be mine?
Excuse me?
Happy Valentine's Day.
- Still 100.
- McGillis is here.
I'll be right back, okay?
Carol, how long is Sparky gonna be with us?
Until Grabarsky gets off duty tonight.
"One of God's creatures."
Hey, Deb.
Deb?
You all right?
What?
I said, are you okay?
Yeah.
Sure.
Very okay.
She left four hours ago.
Does that mean abandonment?
- It does.
- Merits an investigation.
She dumps a child who's sick, speaks no English, has no clue...
It's okay.
Tatiana needs to stay here at least 24 hours.
Longer if she doesn't get any better.
Then what happens?
Assuming Mom's still out of the picture Children and Family Services will find her a foster home.
There's nothing else we can do.
I have a lot of work to do.
I'm being released today.
You've made a remarkable recovery.
I couldn't have done it without you, Susan.
May I call you Susan?
Sure.
You said you needed to talk to me about something.
Every cardiologist should go through what I did.
Lying on that gurney, not knowing whether you're gonna live or die and seeing the face of this lovely, young resident hovering over you.
Well, I can understand how it must've been very scary for you.
It was terrifying at first.
But then, exhilarating.
Now I've got a whole new perspective on life.
My own and my patients'.
That's terrific.
I really should get back.
Have you thought about cardiology, Susan?
You'd be an excellent candidate.
And I'd like to help you.
Be a mentor of sorts.
- Thank you, Dr. Kayson...
- No, please call me Jack.
I'm still doing my ER residency.
I should just stick with that for now.
We should talk more about this another time.
That'd be fine.
Tonight, 8:00 dinner?
How's the pain?
I had a fifth of Demerol.
You mean 50 milligrams of Demerol?
I see that it's working.
Can you wiggle these fingers for me?
- I should stick with decorating.
- He crushed your hand pretty good.
You've got three metacarpal fractures, but I think you'll survive.
I'll get somebody to put a cast on.
- How's the boy?
- Boy?
The one who squeezed me got hit by that train.
He died up in O.R.
Dr. Greene, dueling meatpackers coming in.
About five minutes away.
- Carol?
- What?
- Whoa.
- Sorry.
- Are we not loving our job?
- I am not loving the limits of my job.
Watching that little girl sitting out there, completely abandoned.
Nothing we can do.
Maybe you need a change of pace.
How about a nice, greasy trauma?
Sunny-side up or over-easy?
I can offer you both.
Okay, but how long do I have to wait?
That's the beauty of it.
You don't.
- Happy Valentine's Day, Doris.
- Likewise, Dr. Greene.
Meet Mr. Lorenzo Renzetti.
45, sturdy, aluminum meat hook firmly embedded in his bicep.
How's that feel, Mr. Renzetti?
You can call me Lorenzo.
I don't know, it's not so bad.
That's good, because it sure looks bad.
Started one IV.
BP is 140 over 90.
Pulse 96, resp's 16.
Good distal pulses, normal cap refill.
Defensive lacerations on both arms.
Mr. Renzetti, we're gonna take care of you.
All right, we're gonna move him.
All right, on my count.
- One...
- Watch your back.
Why don't you just scoot over.
Don't let the gurney roll.
Okay.
Good.
I got you.
Doris, you said this was a twofer.
Second guy, second unit.
I drove circles around him.
Let's hand some Ancef, one gram, IV piggyback and let's update Lorenzo's tetanus.
I'll start a chart.
I had that when I went to the Caribbean.
- How was it?
- It was all right.
It rained a lot.
Want a chest film plus humerus films?
Call Radiology and get a portable.
Lorenzo.
Just lay down, okay?
Take it easy.
They should've brought Paulie here first.
Who's Paulie?
My stupid kid.
He made a crack about his mother.
I didn't want to fight, but he kept coming at me.
Move your thumb.
- Now your wrist.
- He kept jabbing me.
You shouldn't disrespect your mother.
Where is the son of a bitch?
I'm sure he's on his way.
He'd better be, because he's in worse shape than I am.
We're gonna take this out in surgery.
There he is!
Hey, Paulie!
I'm over here, son.
Your dad's over here.
You okay?
Son?
Carol, come with me.
He's in fib.
Paddles.
I'm right here, son.
I'm right here.
Is he all right?
- Two hundred.
- Charging.
Clear.
- Three hundred.
- Charging.
- Is he okay?
- Clear.
He's okay, right?
- Damn it!
360.
- Charging.
He needs more volume.
It's gonna be okay.
You'll be fine.
Exam 2?
Okay, here we go.
This way, you guys.
There you go.
We'll be with you in just a second.
You have to admit, they're pretty cute.
They've been spray-painted, giving them hives.
Children with hives are not cute.
So, Peter about the flower and candy in the refrigerator?
Are you gonna make me guess who they're for?
They're for my mother.
Really.
Excuse me, where is Exam Room 1?
- Thanks for moving her.
- Oh, sure.
She insisted on bringing Bill.
Hello and goodbye.
That and ten other words is the extent of my Russian.
They're kind of perfect together.
No idea where they are or what they're doing.
- Neither one of them seem to mind.
- The dog gets to go home with Grabarsky.
Maybe her mom will come back.
I don't think "mom" is the right word.
Carter, Dr. Ross needs you to help with some kids in Exam 2.
How do you say goodbye?
Tell Dr. Ross I need him now.
Hey, Deb.
Are you Wendy Goldman?
Yes Deb.
I'm Deborah Chen.
I know that.
I had the hardest time finding you.
I'm gonna be doing your cast.
- How long was he in the hot tub?
- 40 minutes.
- Any wine?
- Champagne.
- How much?
- A little.
A couple of bottles.
- It's Valentine's Day.
- Eddie wanted something special.
- He got nauseous.
- Then he threw up.
- It was horrible.
- Then he sank.
We went under.
Both of us pulled him up.
Ran into the house.
Called 911.
- You did the right thing.
- We'll take it from here.
We're gonna take his temperature now.
Rectally.
You might wanna wait outside.
We'll be right back, okay?
You still think it's upper respiratory?
Now that she's hydrated, I heard rales.
Could be pneumonia or a foreign virus we know nothing about.
Fever's spiked up to 104.
I'm gonna put a rush on that x-ray.
- You give her acetaminophen?
- Yeah. 15 per kilo.
All the times my mom tried to teach me Russian.
All the times she yelled at me in Russian.
You deserved it.
Doctor B.
Mrs. Hayden, 85, fell and cut her arm.
She's in the Suture Room, and she's a tad senile.
Give it to Carter.
He's busy taking care of six small, red children.
Where's the other one?
Deb Chen?
Doing a cast.
All right, have her wait.
Is Dr. Ross here?
What's wrong?
I'm Jake Leeds.
I need to talk to Dr. Ross.
Look, he's very busy right now.
I can find someone else for you.
What's wrong?
My side and my stomach.
It really hurts.
We're gonna take him to Curtain 2.
Call his mom, Diane Leeds, up in Risk Management.
- Sure, Dr. Ross.
- Carol.
Come on, buddy.
All right, what's wrong?
Where's it hurt?
Here we go.
It started here in my stomach and now it feels like it's over here.
Like this?
There.
It hurts there.
Any vomiting or nausea?
- Right after gym.
- Temp's normal.
Okay, let's get a CBC, urinalysis and set him up for an ultrasound.
All right, Jake, hang tight.
We're gonna check you out.
- Where are we gonna put him?
- Admitting him straight upstairs.
Haleh, could you tell those two hookers that their friend is doing fine?
I think they'd rather talk to a doctor.
Tell them I'll meet them in the waiting room.
So what was that with Kayson?
What?
Oh, you know, he just wanted to tell me that he was fine, thank me.
Nice try.
I saw the bouquet.
Oh, God.
Did anyone else?
It was so embarrassing.
He just gave you flowers.
It's not like he asked you out or anything.
- He did?
- Dinner, tonight.
- What'd you say?
- I said...
Mark, chopper on the way.
Some woman choked on her Valentine's dinner.
I said I couldn't.
That I was doing something with you.
You dragged me into it.
- Mark, he's married.
- Yeah?
Well, so am I.
You're looking better, Jake.
Are you feeling better?
No.
Dr. Ross tells me you're a very good basketball player.
Yes, I am.
I'm probably better than he is, except he's older.
- Is he divorced?
- What?
My mom says divorced people have baggage.
Well, he isn't divorced.
Then he doesn't have baggage.
Well, I wouldn't say that exactly.
- He's faking.
- How can you know that?
Because he has that moany voice like when he wants to stay home from school.
- Could be appendicitis...
- He's done this before.
- Faked illness?
- No, tried to set me up with single men.
What?
He likes you.
I'm his mother, and he's stuck with me.
He thinks if he can get us to spend time together, we will naturally, you know...
- Well, that's...
- Obviously ridiculous.
Obviously.
And he's done this before?
I've been through 5 or 6 departments here alone.
Not to mention hardware stores.
Jake feels I should either be with a doctor or a man who knows his way around nuts and bolts.
So how do you suggest we handle this?
Let's cut him open.
The kid's faking it.
Dr. Ross, test results back on that Russian girl.
Oh, man.
Her white count's at 2,000.
You mean 20,000.
No.
Two.
And she has pneumonia.
She's got AIDS.
Mrs. Hayden?
Yes?
How did you get in here?
There is no starch.
No.
No.
You know what?
We're out of starch.
But I need it for Joe's uniform.
Okay.
Just sit right here.
You know what?
I'm going to...
I'm gonna have to take a look at this arm.
I don't suppose you remember if you're allergic to lidocaine or Novocaine?
Some of the wives don't bother.
Okay.
Well, we're just gonna have to jump in here.
Joe likes his uniform and his collar crisp.
Would you like me to iron your uniform?
- All right.
- That'd be great.
How can she do that?
- It doesn't matter.
- It does to Tatiana.
The situation is what it is.
We'll do what we can.
Well, it isn't much.
We bring down her fever and kick her out?
- Children and Family Services will...
- She's got AIDS!
She doesn't speak English.
She's barely a candidate as a foster child.
- So what do you suggest that we do?
- Anything else.
There isn't anything else.
I know.
You know, these patients come in here for an hour, maybe two maybe a day.
We treat them fast, barely learn their names and then send them home.
Which is usually what they want.
They usually have a home to go to.
Dr. Ross, you've still got those chickenpox in 3.
Fine, Jerry.
I'm sorry that the person who was with you yesterday isn't here today.
And I'm sorry that none of us will be with you tomorrow.
And I'm glad you can't understand what's happening to you.
Neither can I.
Malik, move these hearts!
Let's go!
We're going to Trauma 2.
- What do you got?
- Anaphylaxis.
My wife's allergic to shrimp and scallops and all that stuff.
Susan, this is Mr. Goodwin.
This is Dr. Lewis.
We didn't order it.
It must've been that appetizer.
We'll take care of her.
You need to wait outside.
It happened once before.
Her throat swelled up, but not like this.
- Two, three.
Lydia, show Mr. Goodwin where he can wait.
Come on, Mr. Goodwin.
Upper airway obstruction with stridor.
- She's hypotensive.
- BP's 45 and palp.
I'll intubate.
Haleh, get a 6.5 and prep for a crike just in case.
Epi, one to 10,000, two cc's, IV push.
This is hopeless.
Throat's completely swollen.
Let's crike her.
Grab a trach tube.
Benadryl, IV 50 milligrams and cimetidine, IV 300 milligrams.
Pressure's stabilizing, 100 over 80.
Pulse ox 96.
- It's peaking up.
- Nice.
Thank you.
Let's start an epi drip, one milligram in 250 at 10 mics per minute.
Keep her on the antihistamines until the swelling comes down.
Oh, God!
Mark, Susan!
Get over here!
What happened?
She was stable.
- Get her husband in here now!
- Her pressure's crashing.
We gotta scope her.
Did I perforate the esophagus?
- You couldn't have.
- What'd I do wrong?
Nothing.
Get a CBC.
Type and cross six units lytes, LFTs, amylase.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
- What happened?
- Lydia, call for O-neg.
- Has your wife been vomiting recently?
- No.
- Does she have any history of ulcer?
- No.
She has bleeding varices.
SP, tube.
Varices?
What the hell is this?
Mr. Goodwin, is your wife an alcoholic?
Is she?
All right.
Get the catcher's mask.
Inflate the balloon to 200cc's.
It's in the stomach.
Okay, inflate the esophageal balloon to 40 millimeters.
It's stopped.
Great pickup, Susan.
Well, her fever's back down to 100.
You're feeling better, aren't you?
Will you keep an eye on her for me?
Thanks.
- I should've gone into real estate.
- That bad, huh?
- I got off two hours ago.
- Me too.
Can I borrow a pen?
Well, we gotta do something.
I don't want Kayson to think you're a liar.
- Carol, you wanna come?
- I'm on tonight.
- Sorry.
- Bye.
She's very ill.
I know.
You can't take her home tonight.
I know.
After this morning, I'm not sure you'll ever be able to take her home.
I don't want to.
Mrs. Hayden?
I guess you found the starch.
When I found out that I could adopt Tatiana I bought a Russian-English dictionary.
Never got much beyond hello and goodbye.
- Mrs. Hall...
- Can you imagine anything worse than abandoning a child with AIDS?
No.
She was diagnosed last Thursday at St. John's.
Look, Mrs. Hall, or whatever your name is I'm not exactly sure why you're here.
But I'm not interested in listening to you say how sorry you are.
My husband died three years ago.
It was long and slow.
I was young.
You get through.
You go on.
I never really felt that loss until last week.
I never allowed myself to feel it.
Until I looked at Tatiana and I said "There it is."
I cannot I will not let myself get that close to someone and lose them again.
I brought her things.
I forgot how to say goodbye.
Mom?
Happy Valentine's Day.
- This is fun?
- This is fun.
It's 20 degrees out.
Okay, this is fun.
Did I tell you Morgenstern offered me a job as attending next year?
What?
No, you didn't tell me.
That's right, it was last week.
You weren't talking to me.
So, you were talking to me.
What'd you tell him?
- That I had to think about it.
- Oh, please.
Well, you know, there's Jennifer to consider.
Which I didn't.
What'd she say?
What do you think she said?
That, "I'm happy for you, Mark because I know this is what you really want"?
The "this is what you really want" part?
That's right.
Sounds bad.
It was.
So what are you gonna do?
I am going to skate.
Help, I need a doctor!
Is there a doctor?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Wendy.
I understand that she did it perfectly on the dog.
I'll fix it tomorrow.
I think I'm gonna stay home tomorrow.

She looks much younger.
Fran, the storm is getting worse.
How is Santa gonna deliver all the presents?
Gracie, the man is bigger than Dom DeLuise, and he fits through a chimney.
Believe me, he can get through a blizzard.
Oh!
I'm glad you're enjoying your new golf shoes, sir.
Thanks, old man.
Now, hold still.
I wonder if Mr. Belvedere started like this.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, let me help you with that.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
(GROANING) Almost there.
No problem.
Here we go.
Miss Fine, don't you think you should take off your heels?
No.
They're very comfortable.
Okay.
Give me the star.
All righty.
(SNEEZES)
(ALL SCREAMING)
Do you think it looks crooked?
(SIGHING)
Maxwell, stop fooling around.
We have work to do.
C.C., it's Christmas Eve.
Again?
Well, thank God for this blizzard.
If I'm lucky, it will hit so hard they'll have to cancel this whole horrific holiday.
Tea?
(BEEPING) C.C.'s got the right idea.
I could definitely live without that whole buying-gifts- for-people tradition.
But you don't mind receiving them.
Well, duh.
Brighton, you're missing the whole meaning of Christmas.
I know what it means.
Two weeks off from school.
No, Brighton.
It's about giving of oneself.
Yeah.
The gift part is totally meaningless.
Bonuses excluded.
You put on your coat, mister.
We're going down to the homeless shelter and feed some of the less fortunate.
You're gonna learn what it feels like to give of oneself, if it kills you.
Here, Chester.
(BARKS)
(GROWLS)
(SCREECHES)
Whoa!
Go fish.
BRIGHTON:
Help, Maggie!
Dad, how come Brighton gets to go out?
BOTH:
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Give to the poor.
Give to the...
Sorry.
Whoa!
Where are we?
I don't know, but whatever goes up must come down.
Wow!
This hairspray really does hold.
Oh, Chester, are you okay?
Are you all right?
I've been better.
Well, as long as you...
What?
Brighton, did you hear that?
The dog talked!
Picture this.
Inhaling way too much hairspray, suddenly hears dogs talking.
Tonight in The Nanny Zone.
Run for your life.
It's the worst storm ever.
C.C., the Abominable Babcock, is out to destroy Christmas.
Fran, the snowman talked.
Oh, so I guess it's okay for the snowman to say a few words, but God forbid, the dog gets a little chatty, and I'm ready for the loony bin.
What should we do?
Run!
Which way do we go?
Follow me.
Oy!
You have one glass of eggnog...
This river is hot chocolate!
Yeah.
It's so warm and cozy.
You know, it's like being back in the womb, if your mother was a chocolate bunny.
Brighton, see that big white raft?
Grab it!
This isn't a raft.
It's a marshmallow!
All right.
We have to stay calm.
Everything's under control.
Honey, we're traveling via marshmallow down a hot chocolate river with a dog who's talking my ear off.
This is under control by you?
CHESTER:
Better.
(EXCLAIMS)
(TURTLES CHATTERING)
Fran, look, we're in Candy Land.
Everything's edible.
It's a test.
I know it's a test.
And it's all free.
I failed.
Look, an ice cream castle.
It's a banana split-level.
(MUMBLING)
Fran, stop praying.
We're gonna be okay.
No, honey.
I'm praying it's all fat-free.
FRAN:
I wonder if they got Weight Watchers up here.
Brighton, calm down.
Stop hoarding all the candy.
That kid never knows when to stop.
Do you need a Gas-X?
(BURPS) No, it passed.
Meanwhile, look at this delicious candy cane.
Oh, my!
(SCREAMS)
Oh, my!
I've had my food repeat on me, but this is ridiculous.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Hi.
I'm Fran, and this is Brighton and Chester.
I'm Elfis.
Elfis?
Yes, Elfis.
♪ They call me Elfis Because of my pelvis
♪ King of the elves
Thank you very much.
You know, Vegas is looking for someone like you.
Meanwhile, can you tell us where we are?
You're at Santa's castle.
Well, this is just about the most delicious house
I've ever seen.
Well, Santa is the second richest person in the North Pole.
Oh?
Who's the richest?
The dentist.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Is he single?
There.
I'm finished with my last lemon drop.
(LAUGHS WICKEDLY)
What was that?
Oh, that was C.C., the Abominable Babcock.
She gets irritable like this every 28 years, and this year she's threatening to ruin the whole holiday.
Well, what's her problem?
Well, she's only happy when she's making everyone around her miserable.
Sounds like my mother.
Be careful.
She's 2,000 pounds with arms like a wrestler.
Oy!
She is my mother.
Let me talk to her.
Obviously, she has never met the likes of Miss Fran Fine.
Listen, sweetie.
Whoa!
We'll talk later, honey.
Hello.
Who are you?
The name is Kris Kringle.
Pleased to meet you.
Really?
And where is Mrs. Kringle?
You know, the one that looks like Barbara Bush?
Oh, she's just a figment of my publicist's imagination, as is the red suit, the beard, and the jelly belly.
Gee, if I knew he looked like this, I might have converted.
I'm Fran Fine, the nanny.
And this is Chester and Brighton.
Isn't that sweet?
He's bringing back all that candy for his sisters.
Yeah, right.
Santa, he just doesn't know the meaning of sharing.
It's like my mother with a lamb chop bone.
She's like Cujo with that marrow.
Fran, you don't believe this is really Santa?
Well, Elfis, it seems like we have a non-believer.
Really?
Well, if you insist.

MAN:
Elfis has left the building.
Brighton, you can't take all those toys home.
It's all right.
He said he's gonna share them with his three best friends.
Yeah.
Me, myself, and I.
Not to be a buttinsky, Santa, but look at the time.
When are you gonna start delivering all the toys?
Unfortunately, with this storm blowing up, there won't be any delivery this year.
I think C.C., the Abominable Babcock, has finally found a way to cancel Christmas.
(ALL GASPS)
And she gets like this every 28 years?
She's very regular.
It's so sad.
I just can't imagine a world without Christmas.
What will we do?
No Christmas.
Wait!
If there's no Christmas, there's no after-Christmas sales.
Well, I am certainly not going to let that cranky cloud cancel this holiday.
Come here!
(ALL WHISPERING)
Look, there's the ice palace.
Oh, I can't believe I have to save Christmas.
Five minutes ago we were in a warm castle.
I was about to watch The Shaggy D.A.
Where's your courage?
Where's your compassion?
Listen to me.
I'm looking for a test of character from someone who drinks out of a toilet.
Look at that!
She left the window opened.
Well, I guess she isn't worried about a draught.
Oh!
Oy!
You see, I figure she's got a whole solar depravation thing happening, you know, cranky 'cause she doesn't get enough sun.
Well, if I turn up the thermostat and warm her up, she'll be in a good mood.
Now, Chester, you're my lookout.
Just whistle if you see anything.
There it is!
(BUZZING)
I don't know what you're so worried about.
I will pulverize that Abominable Babcock if she gets anywhere near... (WHIMPERING)
Will you stop fooling around?
(YELPING)
Will you cut it out?
(LAUGHING)
I thought I told you to whistle!
Hello!
I have no lips.
Oh, all right.
Just remember, whatever happens, we're in this together.
Right?
All for one, one for all.
Who did this?
She did.
C.C.:
Christmas is doomed.
(LAUGHING) Don't change the channel.
Oh, honey, this will take forever.
Give me that picture of Mel Gibson.
(SIGHING)
Fran, I wanna go home.
We can't just bail on Santa.
Niles is making your favourite apple-raisin stuffing.
We're out of here.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
With this terrible storm the Abominable Babcock is blowing up,
I won't be able to ride my sleigh tonight.
Uh, am I just stuck here a day or two, or are we talking my next waxing appointment will be under the name Magilla Gorilla?
(CLOCK CHIMING)
Oh, no.
It's beginning, sir.
Look around.
Everything's beginning to freeze.
There isn't much time left.
I haven't seen anyone this cranky since my sister went three years without a date.
Hey, wait a minute.
That's it.
I've got another great plan.
Well, I quit.
They used 12 different Beethovens, and I don't even have one lousy stunt double.
Listen to me.
When the going gets tough, the tough throw a party.
Excuse me.
I have a soirée to plan for a certain ice princess.
Throw a party for the Abominable Babcock?
Well, there's no way I'll be going to that.
Hello.
Thanks for coming.
Have some rumaki.
Fran, why would you want the Abominable Babcock at a party?
She's an evil ice princess.
She should be destroyed.
Oh, leave it to me, honey.
I know what I'm doing.
You fools have nothing to celebrate!
Christmas is finished!
So go!
Oh, shove a sock in it, you big old bag of wind.
What?
How dare you?
You know, I don't know what her secret admirer sees in her anyway.
Come again.
Did you say secret admirer?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
You have a secret admirer.
See you.
Wait!
And just who might this secret admirer be?
Well, honey, he's very cute, good personality, and he's a weather just like you.
Well, toodles.
Get back here!
Will you stop acting so hard up?
Men do not like women who are so desperate.
Now, I am going to introduce you to him, but only if you promise that you'll stop trying to destroy Christmas.
All right.
I promise.
None of this cranky business, or I'm never fixing you up again.
I swear I'll be moderate with my weather patterns.
Now introduce us.
The suspense is killing me.
We should be so lucky.
Shh!
C.C., the Abominable Babcock,
I would like you to meet your secret admirer, the Rain Man.
Yeah, definitely rain.
Definitely raining.
15.783 inches of rain in the North Pole this year.
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, isn't he adorable?
Hello.
Could I interest you in a little stroll around the planet?
Definitely.
I'm an excellent driver.
(CHUCKLING)
(ALL CHEERING)
Oh, Fran, that was so cool.
It worked.
It's a miracle.
Honey, now that is what Christmas is all about.
You give with your heart, you help the less fortunate, and you offer your friendship.
That's when miracles happen.
Don't give gum to Chester.
He'll be blowing bubbles out the wrong end.
Going my way?
Well, I don't usually take rides from strangers.
Oh, look, you put on your costume.
On you it works.
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
Wow!
The actual reindeer.
Hi, doll.
I'm Dancer.
♪ Baby, remember my name, remember... ♪
All right.
Cut it out.
Are you Blitzen?
It's Blintzes.
Who else are they gonna get to work on Christmas Eve?
You know, Rudolph's a little under the weather.
Chester, would you lead my sleigh tonight?
Hi.
I'm Vixen, and I'm a sucker for a fly boy.
What do you say?
I say we have some toys to deliver, woman.
FRAN:
I've got the perfect ensemble for just this occasion.
It's strange that no one's left you any cookies this year.
Yes.
Very strange.
What?
I'm not even getting minimum wage.
Whoa!
Brighton, it's the homeless shelter.
Look, it's Santa!
Well, this is our last stop.
Woops!
We have a problem.
I seem to have miscalculated.
I'm short a few presents.
You know, the man has nothing to do for 364 days.
Boys and girls,
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Unfortunately...
Wait, Santa.
You forgot about these presents.
Oh, Brighton, that's so sweet.
Those were the toys you so selfishly hoarded the whole time we were in the North Pole.
I know.
But I've got plenty of toys at home.
And us kids, we have to look out for each other.
Brighton, you're making me all verklempt.
FRAN:
Oh, what a day.
I can't believe I'm driving Santa's sleigh.
What an upper.
It's my way of thanking you for saving Christmas.
Oh, Santa, please, it's nothing.
But between you and me, I might have ended up on your naughty list.
If you wouldn't mind erasing my name...
Deal.
Woops!
Whoa!
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
Merry Christmas!
Daddy, there they are.
Are you okay?
Miss Fine, are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you won't believe the day I had.
First, I saved Christmas, and then I drove the sleigh.
Tell them, Brighton.
Frostbite.
Stop it!
Brighton, don't you remember anything?
The last thing I remember, we were on our way to the homeless shelter, you got hit in the head, and we got caught in a blizzard.
Hey, we gotta go.
It's closing soon.
What's your rush all of a sudden?
Don't you know what Christmas is all about?
We kids have to look out for each other.
I'm sure you're just a little shook up.
Let's go inside and get our coats.
And perhaps we'll all go to the homeless shelter.
I guess it was a dream.
Jewish reindeer, candy castles, dogs talking.
Of course it was a dream.
You ate all that chocolate and your pants still fit.
Oh, right.
Hello!
Okay.
The first thing we do is book you on Letterman.
You know, I'm very tight with Paul Shaffer.
He's a cousin.
Well, my neighbor's cousin.
But who's counting?
Welcome to a special Tool Time on location. I am Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor.
And you all know my assistant, Al "La Carte" Borland.
We're here on location to introduce to you another unsung hero of the job site.
That's right.
Heidi, my unsung heroes theme music, please.
Heidi.
Heidi!
Guys, back to work, please.
Here you go, Tim.
(# march)
# He gets no thanks and that ain't right
# He's the unsung hero of the job site
All right, today we're gonna meet the man who drives this great-looking lunch wagon.
Hi, there.
This is Nick Cantalupo.
The man, the melon.
Thanks, Tim.
Uh...
Your food service vehicle doesn't get much respect in the culinary community.
People call it the "roach coach," the "barf bus,"
the "upchuck wagon," the "vomit van."
Well, Nick, you're really whetting my appetite.
Good.
Because today we're serving up some really savory selections.
Chili and onions, chili cheese dogs, three-cheese chili omelets.
(whistles) I think I've died and gone to heaven.
I know what killed ya.
- Why don't you show us inside the truck?
- Glad to, Al.
(whistles) Boy, Nick!
This place is immaculate.
Thank you, Tim. I take great pride in my sanitary skills.
Over here we have your heated service trays.
Now, this looks to be some type of a cooling unit.
Yes, Al. ln our business, we refer to it as a refrigerator.
And over here, this is Rosie, the fastest short-order cook in the business.
- Hi, Rosie.
- Tell her whatever you want, and you'll be eating before you're done ordering.
Three stacks of pancakes, eggs over- medium, home fries smothered in chili.
(mock-belches) Boy, that was good.
Very fast.
Pretty fast, huh?
She is fast.
- Hey!
- Wow!
She's speedy with a spatula.
I don't want to brag, but I'm speedier.
- ls he for real?
- lt's a question I often ask myself.
I worked my way through college as a short-order cook.
You get pretty speedy after eight-and-a-half years.
Rosie, may I?
A little more butter on there.
All right.
Don't worry about these eggshells, because basically, it's roughage.
To spice it up a little bit, I like a little of this just...
Ah, OK.
There you go.
Now, watch. I learned this little trick my senior year.
Get some plates. I'm all ready to go.
Ready to go.
I tell you what, Nick - you hold the plate.
Look at that.
Huh?
Clean it up there.
As speedy as I remember.
What do you think, Nick?
Maybe another year of college would've helped my accuracy a bit.
You know, you have your choice of toast, Nick.
Hey!
How're you doing?
Good to see you.
Hey, Milton.
How's everything?
Good to see you.
- Hey, guys.
- Hello, Mr. Harper, sir.
- Hey.
- Hey, boss.
- Great show today at that catering truck.
- Thanks very much.
Some of your funniest stuff, Tim.
Yeah.
What about me?
You were in it, too?
Yes.
But if it pleases you, I can be edited out.
Relax, Borland. I'm just giving you a hard time.
Where's your sense of humor?
In a little town called Nowhere.
If you'll excuse me, I'll go someplace where l get a bit more respect.
- Where's that, Al?
- A little town called Anywhere But Here.
Uh, Tim, you're a big Pistons fan, right?
Yeah.
One of the all-time great auto parts.
(grunts)
- No. I'm talking about the basketball team.
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
How would you like a couple of season tickets?
- You're gonna give me season tickets?
- Yes, I am...
Right after you pay me for them.
This guy is selling me his court-side seats, so I'm giving my favorite Tool Man first crack at my old ones.
Oh, boy.
Season tickets.
That is just...
- Yeah, yeah.
Fifth row, center court.
- Ooh!
I mean, these seats are so good you can high-five with the team mascot.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Sir Slam-A-Lot!
- That's right.
Oh, this is a dream, man.
This is really a dream - season tickets.
- l'd better call Jill.
- Oh, no.
No time for that.
No.
A VP at General Motors also wants them, and I'm meeting him for lunch at about two.
What time is it now?
1 :59.
Let me sleep on it. (snores)
OK.
Hike.
He's out, he throws to the quarterback.
Turns around.
Yeah!
- Touchdown!
- Touchdown.
Hey, guys.
You won't believe what I bought today.
Whoa!
Pistons tickets.
Not only Pistons tickets - season tickets.
And they're all mine, mine, mine, mine.
Wah-wah-wah-wah.
You know, Dad, I was just thinking that you and I really don't get to spend enough quality time together.
I bet you figure we could bond nicely at the BullsPistons game.
- l want to bond at the Orlando game.
- No, no.
I gave that ticket to Nick Cantalupo.
- Who's he?
- A very angry man.
- ls Mom home?
- Nope.
- She's with Mark getting him new glasses.
- l can't believe she let you buy these.
What do you mean, "let" me?
- You didn't tell Mom?
- No.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Hold it.
There's nothing to worry about.
Let me explain how this marriage works.
Your mom and I don't need to talk over every decision, you know.
- Why can't I get contact lenses?
- l didn't say that you couldn't.
I said that we have to check with your father first.
That's how our marriage works.
We don't make decisions without checking with each other.
Hi.
Unless the decision had to be made in a minute, 'cause if both partners agree...
Autonomous decisions are not bad... lt's not unusual for a partner to make a decision without... lt does happen in a marriage that you can make those... lt does...
You can... (clears throat)
Boys, will you excuse us for a moment, please?
- Good luck, Dad.
- Think bonding.
OK, Tim.
What did you buy and how little do we need it?
It's no big deal.
Bud offered me some Pistons tickets, so I bought them.
- How much were they?
- $50 apiece.
- Well, that's not so bad.
- No, it's not.
Here we go.
- How many games?
- (softly) All of them.
What?
All of them.
- How many games is that?
- Well, more than none and less than 41 .
40 games at $50 apiece?
That's, like, $ 2,000!
- Per seat.
- Per seat?
How many seats did you buy?
One... and the one next to it.
Two seats!
That's... that's $4,000!
Unless they get in the play-offs. 'Cause play-off tickets are more than regular seats.
- More?
- lt is ridiculous. I'll send them a letter.
And send it from a new address!
Let's not worry about the play-offs.
They'll never make it!
What am I talking about?
They're a lousy team this year.
You spent $4,000 on a lousy team?
- Let me explain about basketball.
- All right.
You cannot get season tickets like this with a good team.
You gotta ride out the bad years, hoping for a good one.
That's what you said 1 7 years ago when I married you. I'm still waiting for a good one.
(mock laughter) I can't believe that you made a decision like this without discussing it with me first.
Bud needed an answer right away.
And you buy a lot of stuff without asking me.
Like what?
This couch.
How can you compare?
I bought the couch because we need a place to sit!
That's why I bought the tickets. I want to go to the game. I need a place to sit.
This money is for education.
For my graduate school, the kids' college fund... I won't dip into the fund.
We'll get the money someplace else.
- Where?
- Well, you know, I wouldn't... I wouldn't mind giving up that vacation we had planned.
You didn't care about going to New York anyway.
We don't have to now, 'cause the New York Knicks are coming to town.
The Washington Bullets, the Celtics - the entire Eastern seaboard'll be right here!
Don't look at me like that.
Then put the money back in the bank account.
Did I explain that, from where these seats are,
- you can touch the mascot, Sir...
- (door slams) ...Slam-A-Lot?
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
How're you doing, Harry?
Oh, what a surprise.
Benny's still here.
Hey, Al.
Did you take your mother-in-law to get her bunions removed?
Yeah.
But I'd rather have kept the bunions and had my mother-in-law removed.
Hey, Harry.
You hear Tim picked up season tickets to the Pistons?
I hope it doesn't go to his head.
A guy gets season tickets, it affects his demeanor.
Nah.
Tim isn't like that.
Yeah.
Besides, people only change if you treat them different.
And we're not gonna do that.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!
Hey!
Good to see you, man!
Hey!
Get him a cup of coffee and a bear claw.
- He takes sugar in that coffee.
- My pleasure.
It would be an honor to serve my best friend.
Does me being your best friend have anything to do with having season tickets?
The two things are not unrelated.
Well, look, he's taking me to the game first because I'm his hardware guy.
No. lf anyone deserves to go, it's me. I'm his brother.
Excuse me. I'm the one that risks his life every day working next to him.
- Uh, the man's got a point.
- All right, OK.
But I'm next after Al.
Maybe none of you are going, because maybe I'm not keeping the tickets.
Why would you give up season tickets?
When I went home and told Jill I bought them, she got mad and...
- she gave me the look.
- Ooh.
Not the look.
What's the look?
Oh, come on. lt's just the most potent weapon in a woman's arsenal.
Her face will transform right in front of you.
Her lips get really tight like this.
Yeah.
And then her whole face shrivels up.
It's like...
Yeah.
And then her eyes get real small and meet right in the middle of her head like a Cyclops in a housecoat.
Just when you think you can't take anymore, she lines you up and finishes you off.
Ohh!
I'm never getting married.
And not just because women can't stand me.
I hate the look.
What do you know about the look?
You're not even married.
I get the look when I'm snippy to Mother.
But in your mom's case, the look's actually an improvement.
Hey, Tim, you have to keep the tickets.
I don't think I can.
No, I don't know if this is gonna be worth it.
Every time I go to a Pistons game, I'll get the look.
And what about the look you get when you get home?
(shudders)
That's two looks per game.
Times 40 games, that's 80 looks.
And that doesn't count the looks I get for just doing normal bad things.
Yeah.
But you gotta stand your ground.
You can't let your wife intimidate you.
- Harry!
- Dolores!
Uh, what are you doing here?
You want to know what I'm doing here?
I'll tell you what I'm doing here.
You all remember my lovely wife, Dolores.
- Hi.
Nice seeing you.
- How are you?
How could you drop my mother off at the podiatrist and just leave her there?
I gave her bus fare.
She just called.
She can't even get her shoes on.
Go back and pick her up.
- Why can't you?
- l'm in the middle of a shift.
- Well, I'm working too.
- Yeah, right.
Looks like you're killing yourself.
Harry, I'm telling you to go get her.
I'm telling you no.
Look out, guys.
Here it comes.
Oh, my God!
I've never seen anything like it.
Where's the podiatrist?
I'll go get her myself.
Listen, I'll drive you there.
I'll show you the way!
Thank goodness we shut our eyes at the right time, Marty.
Man, they're dropping like flies.
- Hey, Tim.
You gotta stand up to Jill.
- Oh.
No, no.
'Cause every time one of us gets beaten down by the look a little piece of every man dies.
And I think we all know what that piece is.
My contact lens has to be around here somewhere.
Way to go, Mark.
The contact has spent more time on the floor than it has in your eyes.
Anybody home?
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dad.
- (Brad) Hey, Dad.
- Well... I don't care what you're playing, but I'm in.
It's called "Looking for Mark's Contact."
How do you play?
You look for Mark's contact.
OK.
Whose turn?
OK, Dad. it's yours.
OK, one, two three... go!
(Brad chuckles)
Wait, I found it!
It was in my eye the whole time.
Well, if you're gonna cheat...
What's happening with the basketball tickets?
- Have you caved in?
- l'm not giving up the tickets.
'Cause if I do, a little piece of every man dies.
Which piece?
You just never mind.
- Tim, we need to talk.
- Boys?
We know, we know.
OK.
I was thinking about the tickets, and maybe I was a little unfair.
- Really?
- l know how important they are to you.
So I think I've come up with a really good compromise.
How about you keep the tickets for five games, and you sell off the rest?
- Five out of 40?
That's a compromise?
- That's $500. I think that's fair.
You don't understand the concept.
These are season tickets, not whenever- -your-wife-wants-you-to-go tickets.
So you're not willing to budge at all?
If I give up my tickets because of my wife, other wives will pick up on this.
Soon, wives everywhere are gonna be going, (female voice) "You know, the Tool Man gave up his season tickets.
You should too."
Attendance starts dropping at stadiums.
Next thing we know, it's the end of professional sports worldwide.
You are just completely unwilling to compromise!
Yeah. I don't even know the meaning of the word "compromise."
You don't know the meaning to a lot of words.
And don't you forget it.
- Hey, Wilson.
- Well, hi-dee-ho, neighbor.
- What are you doing?
- l'm barbecuing some jerk.
Anybody I know?
Actually, jerk is a very spicy dish native to the island of Jamaica.
You know, I'm thinking of going down there and doing a little bamboo rafting.
Well, you got it made.
Unattached guy like you...
You don't need permission to go to 40 Pistons games.
Uh-oh.
I take it Jill was not too thrilled with your recent purchase.
That's putting it mildly.
First, she gave me the look.
The look!
- You know about the look?
- Tim, every man knows about the look.
Wives have been giving their husbands the look for untold centuries.
In fact, the look was the reason brides started wearing veils.
It was long believed that the penetrating stare of a bride could weaken her husband and render him impotent.
I thought that was caused by all the brown liquor at the reception.
Well, that could do it too, Tim.
I gotta be honest with you.
Jill's look did weaken me. lt did.
- But I didn't break.
- Ah.
Then she brought out the sneakiest, most underhanded trick in the book.
- What was that?
- Compromise.
Ah!
The old ploy where both sides decide to be reasonable.
Reasonable?
Five games out of 40 is reasonable?
I don't think...
- What was your counteroffer?
- l don't think that applies.
- Because you didn't make one.
- No, I did not.
You know, I'm reminded of an old philosopher who once said:
"You have to give a little, take a little..."
"Let your poor heart break a little."
# That's the story of
# That's the glory of love
All right, Nick.
You got Atlanta on the second.
- Got it.
- l want Seattle on the 1 5th of November.
- All right, Al.
You got it.
- OK.
But I want the Bulls on January 21 st.
- January 21 st is our anniversary.
- Well, guess where we're going.
Over my dead body.
Well, at least for once it'll be nice and quiet in the car.
- Dolores, I'll take the Bulls.
- l'll go with you.
- lf you got the Bulls, I'm taking Houston.
- l'll go with you.
- l want Phoenix.
- l'll go with you.
I don't even know you.
Who really knows anybody?
- Well, hi, everyone.
- Hi, honey.
Um...
- Watch the board.
- Sure.
- What's going on?
- Um... I decided to compromise.
You did?
You gotta give a little, take a little...
Uh...
Want me to sing it?
Not really.
But I would like to hear some more about this compromise.
OK.
I wanted all 40.
You wanted five.
What do you say we settle on 1 5?
Fifteen's still a lot of money.
- Let's settle on ten.
- How about eight?
- Ten.
- How about none?
Eight's good.
OK.
- Tim, could we see you for a second here?
- Yeah?
Harry's got an interesting point.
What if the Pistons get into the play-offs?
How do we divvy up those tickets?
The play-offs cost more money anyway, right?
I already got my eight tickets.
- You fight over 'em.
- You're giving up play-off tickets?
Yes, Marty.
Because I know "The Glory of Love."
Want me to sing it?
No, thank you.
If the Pistons make the play-offs, can I buy some games?
What do you want with play-off games, honey?
I'm gonna take my husband.
Hey.
Your husband's a very lucky man.
How come you never say anything nice like that to me?
Your husband isn't as lucky.
- l want the Knicks on February 21 st.
- Oh, I hate the Knicks.
I'll go with you.
Oh, sorry, Dolores.
That's one of my eight.
I'm from New York, and I want the Knicks.
Well, I'm from Detroit, and I like the Knicks.
I'm not selling them.
Oh, really?
She is good.
Really good.
I'm telling you no!
Look out, guys.
Here it comes.
[Horn honks]
I'm Alex Mack.
I was just an average kid until an accident changed my life.
And since then, nothing's been the same.
My best friend Ray thinks it's cool.
My sister Annie thinks
I'm a science project.
I can't let anyone else know, not even my parents.
I know the Chemical Plant wants to find me and turn me into some experiment, but you know something?
I guess I'm not so average anymore.
[Grunts]
[Laughs]
I thought that having the powers would change my life and maybe they have a little.
But how come I'm just as scared of 8th grade as I was of 7th?
Right here.
Right here.
[Grunt]
Hey, yo, Al.
Give me the puck?
[Screeching tires]
Whoa, look out.
Is that Annie?
[Laughs]
Yeah, can you believe it?
[Laughter]
Whoa.
How can you ignore the progress we've made in the past
12 months?
Well, because your view of progress and mine aren't the same, Ms. Atron.
We've thrown tens of millions of dollars into this GC-161 project and so far I've seen nothing to make me feel our investment was well spent.
With all due respect, we were in the process of developing for you what could become the most sought after drug in modern history.
A vanity drug that preserves youth, health and fitness without exercise?
[Laughs] Please.
This is a trillion dollar jackpot here.
Yeah, only if it's manufactured.
But if we don't see some results soon, we're going to withdraw all funding.
Is that a threat?
It's a promise, Ms. Atron.
Canada is where I belong, in hockey school.
The NHL doesn't even care if I understand Algebra or not.
Last year it was the NBA, the year before you were going to be a chess master, when we were eight, you wanted to be a sumo wrestler, remember?
"I just got to get fat Alex."
[Screeching tires]
[Laughter]
[Crash]
Oh, no dents.
Hey, I think I'm ready for the test, don't you?
I think possibly it couldn't hurt for you to have a few more lessons.
I'm going to go inside and lie down.
[Laughter]
What are you laughing at?
A couple more lessons?
Annie, you're the worst driver
I've ever seen.
How can you say that?
The car is supposed to remain on the street at all times when you're driving.
Oh, go easy on her, Ray.
Annie's not used to criticism.
Hey, what are you doing with the journal out here?
I told you it should never leave the house.
What's the big deal?
I'm just outside.
Alex, you still don't seem to grasp the entire concept of the journal.
What are you talking about?
Look, you complained about all the testing I was doing on you, so in my attempt to make your life a little easier,
I gave you the journal to fill out every time you used the powers.
I've been doing it.
Mm-hmm.
Tuesday.
Today I realized that I probably have no future whatsoever.
School starts in two days and I'm just getting sicker and sicker waiting for it.
Oh, yeah.
I also floated some cookies over to me when Dad wasn't looking.
So?
What's wrong with that?
Alex, this is supposed to be a scientific log, not a personal diary detailing your little mood swings.
But just writing about the powers is boring.
Shouldn't be.
All you have to do is test yourself and then enter the results.
I think the whole idea of the journal is stupid.
I'm not gonna argue with you.
You know how dangerous it is if somebody reads what you wrote in there and you still brought it outside.
Hey, why don't you just go read it to Mom?
With everything that's at stake,
I was hoping that you would be able to help me out a little bit but you're obviously too young to take a real science project seriously.
If you want a diary, get a diary.
This is research.
Wednesday.
Today I used my telekinetic power to float a hockey puck to myself.
I notice that it's getting easier, taking less effort and concentration to work.
It came to me straight without wobbling or anything.
Vince, we've got to talk.
At once, Ms. Atron.
I've got to see the effects of GC-161 on a human being.
I can't wait any longer.
They're about to shut me down.
I feel we're getting very close to finding that child,
Ms. Atron.
I don't want to hear that anymore.
I don't want to say it anymore.
[Sigh]
Vince, despite all your assurances, the search has been totally ineffectual.
Now if they pull the funding for this plant, everything I've worked for will be ruined!
And I can guarantee you
I will find another job.
I can't assure you of the same.
Am I understood?
Of course you are, Ms. Atron.
I welcome the challenge.
Hey, Alex.
Hi.
Hey, Ray, what's going on?
Have a good summer?
Great.
Ray, good to see you.
What's up, Ray?
Alex.
Annie, I know school doesn't start for a few days but you really should get out and get a little air.
Right.
Are those Alex's gym clothes she forgot?
Don't worry.
Anything Alex wears could double as gym attire.
But she told me she needed these for today.
Annie, sweetheart, would you mind doing me a favor, please, and walking these over to school?
I'd do it but I'm late for a meeting.
Yes, Mom.
I would mind.
Fine, Annie.
Don't do me any favors.
Really, forget I even asked.
[Sigh]
Just--just give it to me okay.
Thank you.
[Giggles]
[Cheering]
Good job.
Hey, Scott.
Hey, Alex.
What's going on?
You look great.
Thanks.
So what's up with Jessica?
I haven't seen her yet.
Oh, yeah, Jessica is gone.
She moved away with her family.
Really?
Yeah.
Do you miss her?
Yeah, a little.
Sometimes.
Scott.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Oh, hey, Kelly.
This is Alex Mack.
Alex, this is Kelly.
She's new to atron.
Hi.
Hey.
You're an 8th grader right?
Yeah.
Scott, I was going across the street to pick something up to eat.
I can get you something.
No, that's okay.
I've got to get back to the gym.
Hey, Alex, you should try out for the volleyball team today.
They're having sign ups.
I don't think so.
All right, well, if you change your mind, sign up sheet's outside.
Maybe.
All right.
Hey, see you guys later.
See ya.
Now exactly what type of cockroach are we looking for,
Vince?
Dave, we are going to do one more tour of the school area.
A major tour.
That kid is out there.
And unfortunately, you're my only chance of recognizing him.
Well, because it makes a difference.
Now you've got your oriental cockroach, your American,
Australian, your German, Asian, not to mention your brown banded roach.
Now he's a tricky sucker.
Now each one of these pesky critters has a different M.O.
Dave, why can't you ever just listen to me?
My uncle's an exterminator.
They used to call him
Jerry Bugs.
He was a legend in the business.
Would you just keep your mind on what you're doing?
You get the coolest stuff,
Vince.
Dave, let me explain this to you more clearly.
We are under major pressure here and if we don't find that kid soon, I may lose my job.
And if I lose my job, well, you can just imagine what that's gonna mean for you.
I'd hate to see that happen to you, Vince.
Where's that D?
Where's that D?
Oh, yeah, there it is.
There it is.
Go up, go up, go up, go up.
Cool.
Hey, Scott.
[Grunt]
Hey, time out, guys.
Time out.
Hey, are you okay?
I hate sports.
I'm sorry about that,
I thought you were one of the other players.
Hi.
You okay?
Can you get up?
Yeah.
Are you sure you can stand?
I remember you from that fundraiser thing we helped your
Mom with.
You're Alex's genius sister, right?
Oh, I don't know about genius.
[Laughs]
Alex and I are not exactly alike.
Oh, come on.
I'm sure you're just like her.
Yeah, when I was nine maybe.
[Laughter]
But--in fact, considering that we're related, she happens to be kind of average, you know.
[Laughter]
[Bell rings]
All right, guys.
Bring it in.
Are you gonna see Alex later?
Yeah, I should probably see her.
Great.
I've got to get out of here.
Where am I?
Oh, no.
I've got to hide,
I've got to hide.
I've got to hide.
[Scream]
Hi.
Excuse me.
Ms. Atron, you asked to see me?
Yes.
Take a seat.
[Chuckles]
Is there a problem, Ms. Atron?
Not that I know of.
Is there?
I don't think so.
Good.
Make sure you keep it that way.
Listen, I know we put the brakes on your involvement with the
GC-161 research a few months ago, but all that's about to change completely.
From this point forward I want you to head up all our research into the GC-161 formula mechanism and I want to go full throttle.
I need results and I need them quickly.
Are you up to it, Mack?
Are you kidding?
Absolutely.
Good.
Because if you're not
I know a number of researchers who would kill for the chance.
Literally.
No, no.
I'm delighted.
No, I'm honored.
[Laughs]
I just wonder if you could give the rd team a sense of what the potential application of the
Chemical might be.
The potential application of the Chemical, Mr. Mack, is none of your business.
Although, if you must know
I suppose I could tell you it has certain health benefit potential.
It might take the concept of vitamin C to a higher level.
[Sigh]
Well, I couldn't be more thrilled, Ms. Atron.
I won't let you down.
Good.
Now get back to work before I change my mind.
[Chuckles]
Oh.
Thank you.
Face off.
Face off.
Hey, guys.
I got to go.
What's he so scared of?
There's guilt dripping off that kid.
Come on, let's follow him.
Annie, we have to talk.
And what's your problem?
What's my problem?
How about the fact that I manage to be surprisingly average?
What?
Or you were like me once when you were nine.
How--how do you know-- you knew how I felt about
Scott and you still went out of your way to make me look like a complete idiot in front of him.
But wait a second.
How did you hear what I--
Don't worry about it, Annie.
I heard everything.
That's really smart, Alex.
Morphing in school and spying on me.
Great.
Don't turn your back on me,
Annie.
That was so completely horrible what you did.
What were you even doing there?
I just went to the school to bring you your bag.
I didn't mean to cause a catastrophe in your love life.
My bag?
What bag?
The bag Mom put your gym clothes in.
Your flowered knapsack.
I couldn't find anybody so I gave it to Scott to give to you.
Didn't you get it?
You mean, Scott has my bag?
So what?
You'll get it tomorrow.
[Horn honking]
Annie, the journal's in that bag.
What do you mean?
I took it back from you.
I know, and I took it back from you and put it in my bag.
Oh.
Girls,
I have some great news.
You can tell us later, Dad.
Alex left something at school and we have to go back and get it.
Hey.
Honey, guess who has some great news.
Annie.
No, me.
Oh.
I was promoted today to head up all the Plant's research into GC-161.
George!
[Laugh]
We're going ahead full blast and Ms. Atron is looking to me for results.
Oh, honey, congratulations.
Does it mean a raise?
Well, she didn't mention it but I guess it's a possibility.
Well, that's okay we're doing just fine.
A promotion.
Well, I don't get a new title.
Well, maybe by the end of the year.
Does it mean longer hours?
Much longer.
Well, you know, George, that comes with success.
[Laugh]
More pressure?
A lot more.
Danielle's going to be looking over my shoulder every day just waiting for one screw up.
And Vince will probably even be monitoring my phone calls.
[Laughter]
Sounds great, honey.
Congratulations.
[Cork pops]
Oh!
[Laughs]
[Doorbell rings]
Stop that.
Just--
For God's sakes, just keep your mind on your driving and quit eating.
Hey, Raymond.
Is Alex home?
I got to talk to her right away.
No, Alex and Annie went running back to the Junior High for some reason.
Do you want to come in?
Thanks, Mr. Mack.
Got to go.
He's going.
Okay, go, go.
Move, move, move.
It's all right, Vince.
We'll get him. don't worry.
But you're a good hockey...
Oh, there he is.
Okay, I'll get it.
No, Annie, I'll get it.
Haven't you done enough for one day?
Hey, Scott, what's up?
Not much.
Whose bag is that?
Oh, it's Alex's.
I was supposed to give it to her but I forgot.
Maybe you shouldn't be doing that.
Please.
Just for a second.
Wow.
[Laughs]
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.
Today I saw Scott and I almost morphed into a puddle.
Think she has a crush on you or what?
Well, I think you should put that back, Kel.
Oh, just a little more.
I'm not going to tell anyone.
Excuse me, can I have that back please?
Well, look who's here.
Give it back.
But I haven't finished reading it yet.
It's not yours to read.
Give it back.
Come on, Kelly.
Give it back to her, you underachiever.
Come on, guys.
You're going to have to ask nicer than that.
Do not make us force it out of you.
Please give it back to her.
Give it back to her.
What, so give it back to her.
Oh, man.
I don't have trouble--
Well, I think you're--
Oh.
Got it.
Oh, yes.
Check it out, I got it.
Thanks, Ray.
Ray, look out!
Whoa!
Are you okay?
This book seems awfully important to all of you.
It's mine.
Top secret.
[Laughs]
You know this looks like it might be interesting reading.
Hey.
That's private property.
Give it back to her.
Finders keepers.
Isn't that what you kids say?
What are you doing here?
You may be dressed like an exterminator but I happen to know that you're Vince from the Plant.
My name is not Vince.
What's going on, Vince?
Dave.
Hey, watch it, Vince!
I've got you covered.
[Yelling]
[Laughter]
Thanks, Ray.
Any time.
Can we put this away now please?
We can't--
Hey, girls, your father has something he wants to tell you.
Oh, it won't mean anything to them.
It's just that I got this big promotion today.
Danielle told me I'm gonna head up all the research on the GC-161 project.
[Both] What?
You probably don't remember but GC-161 is the Chemical
I was working on when--
We remember, Dad.
That's terrific.
It is?
Yes, it is.
Maybe I could help you work on it here.
That's a great idea.
I mean, it is top secret but I guess I can trust my own daughter.
[Laughter]
I'm very excited about this.
Very excited.
Nice going, Dad.
Yeah, Dad, congratulations.
It's amazing how Annie manages to get so interested in my work.
That was pretty close today.
No kidding.
You were about five seconds away from seeing the rest of your life from the bottom of a microscope.
So I guess the journal was a bad idea.
Alex, if you had left it in this room like you were supposed to, everything would have been okay.
Now I'm going to have to go back to testing you myself everyday and I know how much you hate that.
Good night.
Night.
Thursday.
Decided to start my own diary since Annie's science one almost got me in big trouble.
So it's back to her testing me again.
Some little sisters get to have these great heart to heart talks with their older sisters.
Me, I get my blood pressure checked and I get my zappers measured.
But if that's what it takes for
Annie to pay attention to me,
I can live with it.
I love weddings.
You know, when love is in the air, you can almost reach out and touch it.
Yeah, and sometimes it hits back.
Tess!
Well, not all love is as pure as ours,
Miss Wings.
Have you heard that expression that love is blind?
Mm-hmm.
Well, sometimes it's stupid, too.
(cooing)
Hi, I'm Gale H. Harper.
Hi.
And, uh, well, this is my girlfriend Dolores, but don't say anything to the bride, because, well, I wouldn't want her to get jealous.
Where is Wendy?
Well, the bride and groom have already gone up to the lodge to get ready for the ceremony.
Oh.
Porter!
PORTER:
Yes, sir.
MONICA:
I thought this was a day trip.
It is, but you would be surprised at the baggage that people carry around with them, especially the kind you can't see.
And half the time, it's filled with the past, and looking inside can be the most frightening thing that a person ever does.
Keep the change.
MAN:
Thank you, sir.
Well, lookie here, Mark Monfort!
Gale.
How long's it been?
What, six years?
I can't believe you made it all the way from...
Tanzania?
Pakistan.
Right, right, some backward foreign place.
Yeah, right.
Excuse me one second.
Well, it was good to see ya.
We'll talk later!
We used to be best friends in law school.
Yeah.
Hi, I'm, uh, here for the wedding.
TESS:
hello.
Monfort.
Mark Monfort.
Yes, welcome.
Thank you.
The train will be leaving in about 15 minutes.
Great.
Thanks.
Pakistan.
He did come a long way.
Oh, he's not here just for the wedding.
Mark is on a mission to correct a terrible wrong.
Ah, and that's where I come in.
You make sure he rights therightwrong.
You understand me?
Gotcha.
(train whistle blows)
TESS:
there's Susan-- the old girlfriend.
The one that got away.
TESS:
Mm.
He's on the wrong track already.

Better now.
Well, good.
Let's go.
Well, hello.
Welcome.
Can I get your name?
Susan Duplain.
Great.
Um, hors d'oeuvres and the bar are up ahead in the Sweetheart Car.
There's a band in the Cherish Car, and there's a lounge right down at the very end in the Happy-Ever-After Caboose.
(laughs)
I would not go through this for anybody other than Wendy.
Believe it or not, this is the wedding she always wanted-- trains, trees and a lodge.
30-degree temperatures.
Didn't she ever hear of a June wedding?
(whistle blowing)
Hey, hey!
Does your mama know you have all of that?
You save some for somebody else.
Mm-mmm.
You know, it all started when I tripped on a roller skate at my uncle's house.
Sued his pants off, and now I am the number one personal injury lawyer this side of the Mississippi.
That's great, Gale, I guess.
Oh,you're darn right it's great.
I got ads running all over the tube.
I got 30-second spots running in every major market in the Pacific Northwest.
Oh, look, there's George.
Oh.
Hey, hey, how's this for my slogan?
Call Gale H. Harper.
It can't hurt any worse than this.
Wow.
Thank you for that.
So is there a Mr. Susan?
No.
I never met the right guy.
Actually, I did, but he moved to the other side of the world.
So, is there a Mrs. Mark?
No.
My life's been mostly business for the last six years.
I haven't been in a serious relationship in a long time.
WOMAN:
Hey, cutie!
Lisa.
Hi.
Hey.
Still gorgeous as ever, I see.
Same to you.
Oh, yeah.
Susie, you have to help me with this clip thing for my vest.
I look like a hippopotamus.
SUSIE:
Oh, you don't, Lisa.
You look great.
You're gonna be a beautiful maid of honor.
Excuse me.
Do you know anything about computers?
I know a thing or two.
I'm having a terrible time with my computer.
It has the itinerary and the guest list and everything on it.
All of a sudden, I can't get into it.
Well, let's sit down someplace and have a look.
Thank you.
Okay, let's see what we got here.
I really appreciate this.
I'm just no good with computers.
(computer beeps)
WOMAN:
I'm just no good with computers.
This is the first time I've had to take a test on one.
No, it's pretty simple.
Just, uh, sit down.
Type in your password.
Go ahead.
I won't look.
Wow.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Okay, you want to take an exam, so type "3."
And you want to take your first year contract exam, right?
Right.
I'm not even ready for that test.
Why are you taking it?
I just don't have anything better to do than study.
Oh, well, maybe I can help you with that, too.
Hi.
Doug Richards.
Don't worry about the test.
It's a breeze.
I blew through it in about an hour.
No way.
Yeah, but I like tests.
You could be very valuable.
Some girlfriends of mine are starting a study group.
You guys want to be in it?
Sure.
I'll be in it.
How ya doin'?
Gale h.
Harper.
MONICA:
Thank you.
Isn't that amazing?
I have to log the wedding gifts.
What do you think I should call this?
Returnable.
(chuckles)
Look at this.
I practically got steam coming out of my mouth, and we haven't left the station yet.
By the time we get to the mountains, the cake is gonna be frozen.
You go to a lot of weddings up in Kathmandu?
Pakistan.
LISA:
I want it up.
Everybody else has their hair up.
Oh.
LISA:
You did it.
Thank you so much.
(indistinct chattering)
LISA:
Like a Juliet sort of a thing, goes around...
What are the odds of all the people from our study group getting married to each other?
Really bad if you think Wendy's gonna marry you.
Oh, and why is that?
You went on one date.
She forgot your name.
Oh, like that never happened to you guys?
Come on, Dougie.
You're supposed to back me up here.
I've got a theory.
Some people were just made for each other.
Yes.
I can't believe that you and Susan never got married, but then Wendy and I drifted apart, too.
Huh.
So where is Doug?
What?
I've seen Lisa, but where is Doug?
You mean you didn't hear?
You don't know?
What?
Don't tell me they got divorced.
Doug's dead.
What?
Yeah, it was a real shock.
He was...
Lisa!
You look terrific.
How's work?
Uh, busy.
My dad's law firm.
What's the matter with you guys?
Lisa, I just heard about Doug.
Yeah.
It's been six years, but, um... (voice breaking):
I guess... not long enough.
Excuse me.
Are you okay?
How'd it happen?
Doug committed suicide.
Suicide?
Oh, man.
I am so sorry.
I thought you knew.
Lisa found him in his dorm room.
He hanged himself on graduation day, and she's never been the same since.
They never even got married?
You'd already left for that job in Europe.
Didn't you get my letter?
Oh, I can't believe it.
Yeah, apparently, he cheated his whole way through law school, and then he got caught.
We don't know that, Gale.
But we do know that Doug was our friend.
To Doug.
How am I supposed to sing happy songs about love and marriage with all this deception going on?
Looking at them like this, it's hard to believe.
Well, believe it, because evil is just around the next bend.
MAN:
All aboard!
(whistle blowing)
(bell clanging)
(bell clanging)
(whistle blows)
Are you okay?
Oh, I still can't believe it.
He wasn't a cheater.
Well, he plagiarized his last exam, and he got caught.
What would you call it?
Oh, come on.
Let's not talk about it now.
This is supposed to be a happy occasion.
MONICA:
Welcome.
Hello.
WOMAN:
Hello.
MONICA:
Welcome.
Go on inside.
You can sit anywhere.
It's not formal.
Hi.
GALE (whispering):
Psst.
Hey!
(organ playing hymn)
(strings playing Pachelbel's "Canon in D")
(camera shutter clicking)
Where is he?
This is killing me.
Those interviews are tough.
He probably met someone, needed to unwind.
Gale's available, though.
So, Wendy, babe, you playing our song?
No.
I, uh, actually, I don't see
"get out of my face, you nightmarish cretin"
anywhere.
(up-tempo music playing)
By Friday, you or Doug will have a job at the U.S. Attorney's Office.
No offense, Susie, but I really hope that Doug gets this.
He's been wanting it so badly, and I'll get away from my dad's criminal practice, and we will live happily ever after on theHoneybunny.
On what?
That's the boat Doug's always dreamed of having.
"Honeybunny"?
Yup.
He calls me that sometimes.
He names everything after me.
His car is called "Lisa."
Ooh.
I'm not sure naming that old clunker after you is such a compliment.
Lisa.
Hey!
What happened?
Don't tell me.
Tell me.
I got the job!
(gasps):
Yes!
Whoa!
All right!
GALE:
All right!
Way to go.
I'm sorry, Susan.
Don't.
Nobody deserves it more than you, Doug, not even me.
Drinks are on me, but I can only afford beer, okay?
A toast to Doug Richards!
May he rise from shaking the taste of lowly law students to shaping the course of a nation!
(applause)

I was really proud of the way you handled that.
What?
I know how much you wanted that job.
When I interviewed for the job, they told me I was a contender, but I really was hoping I wouldn't get it.
The problem with being a U.S. attorney is that you have to work in the U.S.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, I was thinking since you're gonna be working in Europe, maybe I should look into international law firms, too.
Uh...
Um...
Never mind.
I, uh...
Forget it.
I didn't say that.
This is embarrassing.
No, it's just that, uh, you know, I thought you wanted to be a judge.
Don't you want to...
Uh... no.
The truth is,
I am not ready.
You know what?
If we don't... if we don't just end it, it'll get ugly, so let's just say it's over, and it was beautiful while it lasted and I'll never forget you.
And maybe someday...
May I cut in?
I've always wanted to say that.
Of course.
Oh, there's one left.
I'm gonna take care of this one.
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
There has got to be one meatball left in this wilderness, and you are gonna find it for me.
That boy.
I mean, it's right there on the screen.
"Hi.
I'm Gale H. Harper.
I'm Gale." I say that.
"I'm Gale." And they still call up looking for a woman.
It's no wonder these people get in accidents.
I heard there was a slip and a fall in the kitchen.
I think it's whiplash.
Excuse me, won't you?
Whew.
Thank you.
(chuckles)
Mark and Susan sure do have a lot of chemistry.
Well, one chemical by itself can be harmless, but you mix them together, and they can be deadly.
So you keep your eye on them and someone who is not on the guest list.
You really ought to make that trip to Europe someday.
This time I promise--
Mark, I've been nominated to the federal bench.
You did it?
Congratulations.
Next stop, Supreme Court.
Thanks.
I feel a little sad about it, though.
Every break I got came from the job
Doug was supposed to have.
No.
They had to replace him with somebody.
Susan, they couldn't have picked a better person.
Thanks.
You always were my biggest fan.
I still am.
You must be the uninvited guest
I've been expecting.
I'm Monica.
I'm Andrew.
Angel of Death?
At your service.
(birds chirping)
Sorry I'm late.
I had to escort Mrs. Arnsdorff.
She's 92, and she still wanted to hang around to see her great-great granddaughter being born.
TESS:
Hello, Mr. Halo!
(laughing)
Where you been?
Oh, you know, here, there, everywhere.
Oh!
(makes kissing sound) Have you met Monica?
Oh.
Oh!
Yeah.
Tess tells me that you're the best.
She does?
Oh, yeah, she tells me about all of her trainees.
You do?
And how is my angel boy?
Oh, good.
I want to tell you, you are looking good!
Now, baby, you know that you're the one who looks good.
Come on, baby.
We got work to do.
All right.
I'm so glad to see you!
Good to see you, honey.

Hello.
I'm Monica.
He was my fianc￩.
He was the greatest, sweetest, kindest, smartest guy.
He killed himself.
Did you know that?
I'm so sorry.
Everybody thinks that...
he cheated.
You know, that's all they remember, that he was a cheater.
But he wasn't.
He was not.
Is that what Doug said in the note?
Yeah.
How'd you know about that note?
The note?
From Doug.
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah.
Anyway, I keep it with me all the time.
It's right here.
It's the only thing I have left.
You know, he could have gone all the way.
He had... he had the...
the guts, he had the brains, he had the heart to go all the way to the Supreme Court.
Lisa.
Look at me.
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm really sorry.
There's no need to be sorry.
But you are a bit mussed up.
MARK:
Lisa!
Lisa, you okay?
I loved him so much.
(crying):
I really did.
Lisa, Lisa, honey, come on.
Let's go get you cleaned up.
Thank you.
Come on.
(sighs)
I'm afraid she's had a hard time.
She told me.
This is a...
a difficult letter to read.
I suggest you skip to the third paragraph.
"I've lost more than my law degree and my job."
"I've lost my reputation, and worse,
"I've lost the only thing I know I was born to do--
"be a fair and honest judge."
"How could you live with a man branded as a cheat?
"How could I live with you
"watching me grow more and more bitter?
"Just remember, I'm innocent.
"Computers don't lie, but somehow that one did.
"But I can't prove it.
"I love you.
"Good-bye.
Doug."
Doug was meant to be a judge, and he would have made a fine and good judge just as he was a fine and good man, but all that was stolen from him.
Do you remember the final exam, Mark?
Yeah.
That was the last time I saw Susan.
(banging on keyboard)
(beeping)
(typing)
(beeping)
(continues banging on keyboard)
(beeping continues)
(sighs)
What's the matter?
I don't know what I did.
I pressed something wrong, and it shut me out of the test.
Were you finished?
No.
I had about a half an hour left on my time.
This is my final.
Half my grade depends on this.
I'm gonna fail.
No, you're not.
Reboot your terminal.
I'll get you back in through the safeguards.
But that's cheating.
(sighs)
Technically, maybe.
Look, I can get you back in.
What you put in the exam is up to you.
I'm just giving you the chance.
Nobody's gonna know.
(computer beeps)
(beeps)
Thank you so much.
You don't know what this means to me.
Okay.
You're all set.
(sighs)
I gotta go pack.
I leave in a couple hours.
Um, drop me a line.
Tell me how graduation goes.
Sure.
Is that all you can remember?
Yeah.
It was a pretty messy way to say good-bye.
You felt guilty about not asking her to go to Europe with you.
Yeah.
Guilty enough to help her cheat?
It wasn't cheating.
Well, I mean, sort of.
I'm not proud of it, but it's not like I gave her the answers.
You gave her something much worse-- time and access to the computer system.
To finish her test.
She had time left.
Running into her that day wasn't an accident, Mark.
She knew you'd be there taking your test, feeling guilty about her and ready to be used.
What?
Remember what Doug's letter said?
"Computers don't lie."
Think about it.
(computer beeps)
Thank you so much.
You don't know what this means to me.
Okay.
You're all set.
(sighs)
I gotta go pack.
I leave in a couple hours.
Um, drop me a line.
Tell me how graduation goes.
Sure.
(sobs)
Wait a second.
I didn't see that.
How can I be seeing that now?
What's going on here?
Mark, don't be afraid.
I've been sent here to help you see the truth.
Sent here?
I'm an angel sent by God.
Are you crazy?
Doug didn't cheat.
Susan used Doug's password to get back into his exam and insert plagiarized material that his professor was sure to catch.
That's ridiculous!
Doug had the job that Susan wanted, and she used you to take it away from him.
No way.
She loved me.
She wanted to marry me, and I hurt her.
That's what she wanted you to think.
And when she was finished using you, she knew exactly how to scare you into running away and out of her life.
Lady, you could not be more wrong, and I don't know who you are, but this is nuts.
Your friend took his life because of her.
God just wants you to see how dangerous Susan is.
I want you to back off!
And stay away from me.
This wedding's over.
I got a train to catch.
(train chugging)
(whistle blows, bell clangs)
All these years
Mark has been blaming himself for hurting Susan, when it was Susan who hurt him.
I hope I can get through to him.
Well, you'd better.
His life depends on it.
I've been looking for you.
Doug killed himself because somebody got into the computer and altered his test.
Who told you that?
I was there, Susan, remember?
I helped you do it.
He was our friend.
He was my best friend.
I'm so sorry.
Ohh.
I had no idea he would do something like that.
Oh, Mark, please.
I was desperate.
I felt like my whole life was falling apart-- the job, you.
(whistle blows)
I was feeling like
I was starting to lose everything, everything that was important in my life.
I don't know.
I guess I just went crazy.
When I found out that Doug--
I almost followed in Doug's footsteps.
When I-I...
When I...
When I realized that I was the cause of his death, I...
I didn't want to go on.
Oh, Mark.
Please.
Oh, please.
Please forgive me.
Oh, Susan.
Susan, it's okay.
Monica.
Listen, I handled a near miss a couple of weeks ago, and I found out something that might make all this a lot easier for you.
I'm doing just fine by myself, thank you.
Did we get off on the wrong track here?
Look, I'm just trying to help you.
You know, my first couple years as a caseworker were pretty rough, too.
I may be a rookie, but I'm certainly not incompetent.
(whistle blows)
Tess...
Don't you "Tess" me.
Andy is my friend.
Obviously.
Oh, is that it?
You thought you were the only angel in the universe?
No, I didn't.
You know I love you, and you know I'm proud of you.
And I love Andy, too.
Love is like air.
There's plenty of it to go around for everybody.
I know that, but Andrew keeps telling me how to handlemyassignments.
Sweetheart, we're all on the same team, trying to win the game together.
Don't you forget who's calling the plays for all of us.
Andrew?
I just wanted to say that my pride got the best of me, and I apologize.
It's okay.
You know, Tess taught me a whole lot about pride, too, so... but Icanhelp you, and so can he.
Just go ask him about his most recent case, and I'll do the rest.
Hello, Gale.
Been looking everywhere for you.
Youhave?
(whistle blowing)
How utterly enlightening.
And you know me.
That's just the way I handle things.
It's a gift.
Mark.
I'm busy.
Susan?
Susan!
Oh, my, my, my.
How are you?
(makes kissing sound)
Howareyou, huh?
Do... do I know you?
No, no, but we have so many friends in common, we should catch up, over here, maybe.
Come on, come on.
Excuse us.
Gale, why don't you tell Mark the story you just told me?
I just told that story.
Ah, but you tell it so well.
Oh.
Okay.
This is all strictly confidential, of course, so don't tell anybody.
Case I'm handling now-- brilliant lawyer, nominee for the federal bench.
He's a lock for the job.
Then he gets caught up in some kind of a weird scandal.
He has a spotless record, yet he is totally, totally discredited.
So, he tries to kill himself by driving down a residential street at 120 miles an hour and slamming into a tree.
Now the future judge doesn't quite make it, and his latest mailing address is vegetable city.
When did this happen?
A couple of weeks ago.
So, anyway, this guy, he's...
Are you sure it was the federal bench?
Yeah, yeah, I am, but the story's not abouthim.
It's aboutme.
So, now, here is the interesting part.
My client, he...
Another life ruined.
So it wasn't just a one-time thing with Susan, Mark.
You weren't the first choice for that appointment, were you?
The first choice just happened to get his reputation ruined.
I want some answers.
He was crooked.
Like Doug was crooked?
You've been manipulating people your whole life to get what you want, Susan.
What do you care how I get there?
The important thing is, once I'm there, there's plenty for both of us.
Think about it.
(exhales deeply)
Lisa?
I lost it.
Lost what?
The letter.
Doug wrote me a letter...
You know, I just don't understand what happened.
I mean, I know he was devastated, but why didn't he come to me?
We could have handled it together.
We could have handled anything together.
But he didn't come to me.
He just ended everything-- not just his life but... our life.
No.
What are you talking about?
You moved on.
You've got your law practice.
There is no law practice.
I didn't even take the bar.
I couldn't.
You don't run your father's firm?
I'm a secretary, Mark.
I run for coffee.
Oh, Lise.
There's a lot of people who care about you, Lisa, including me.
And I know how much Doug loved you and how devastated he would be if he saw you like this.
(bell clanging)
Be right back, okay?
(whistle blows)
Do you believe me now?
Where did you come from?
If you won't listen to an angel, then listen to Lisa.
She's living proof of the nightmare caused by Susan.
An angel?
You weren't kidding.
Why didn't an angel stop Doug from killing himself, huh?
Why didn't an angel stop me from killing Doug?
Mark, you didn't kill Doug.
I helped Susan do this.
I helped her destroy Doug's life and Lisa's in the process.
I'm just as guilty as she is.
No, the only thing you're guilty of is trusting someone who didn't deserve it.
(sighs)
Human beings have the power to make choices, and some of the worst choices are made in darkness.
You made one there.
So did Doug.
(sighs, then sniffles)
I wrote him letters.
All these years, I wrote him letters from England, Germany, Tashkent, Pakistan.
I sent them to his parents.
I never figured he'd write back.
I was always traveling.
I wrote about such stupid stuff.
"The weather was bad.
"Work is good.
"How are the Mariners doin'?"
But it just felt good to know that I was sitting alone the other side of the world, talking to my best friend.
Except I wasn't.
He was closer than you knew.
You have a responsibility now to Doug, you know, and to all the lives this woman could destroy should she remain a judge.
I don't know.
You came back today to right a wrong, didn't you?
Yeah.
I came to finally do the right thing by Susan.
Well, you're here to do right by Doug, too, in more ways than you know.
You know in your heart what the right choice to make is, Mark.
Don't be blinded by what you've mistaken for love.
Hi.
Hi.
We need to talk.
I was crazy to think I could tempt Mr. Clean.
You were always way too honorable.
It's one of the things I loved about you.
You're right, of course.
I don't deserve the bench, and I won't take it.
I will ask one favor of you-- that you will allow me to back out quietly so that I can save whatever reputation I have left.
Oh, is that right?
What about Doug, huh?
What about his reputation?
Doug's disgrace killed him, Susan.
Well, you know what?
You're just gonna have to live with yours, and I'm gonna see to it.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mark.
(sharp groan)
(grunts) (cries out)
(grunting)
(screams)
No!
Help me!
Please!
(crying)
(screaming)
No... no, please!
MONICA:
You know in your heart, what the right choice to make is, Mark.
Mark!
Please don't drop me.
How horrible.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just fine.
Just get in the front of the car and expect trouble when we get off.
Don't threaten me, you weak little man.
I'm gonna bury you.
You're gonna be back working at the gas station just like the day I met you.
You'll never be anything, 'cause you don't have the guts.
I've got guts enough to make sure you don't get in a position of power again.
That's enough.
You were right.
So were you.
Well, it's not going to be pretty, but the truth is out now, and it'll stay out.
Can you help her?
When she's ready, there'll be an angel there for her.
She's not gonna go down easily.
No, not easily, but it will happen.
Just be strong.
I just wish the truth wasn't too late for Doug.
He was the best guy I knew.
You know, that's what he always said about you, Mark.
God never created anything stronger than the power of real love.
It lives forever.
And you never know where it's gonna come from next.
(bell clanging)
Hi.
Hi.
You have a good heart, Mark.
You should share it with someone who knows how to love.
Thank you.
LISA:
You're welcome.
All I said was "hi."
That's enough.
(whistle blowing)
TESS:
Well, Miss Wings,
Did we learn anything here today?
Yes.
I learned three things.
Oh, my.
Thisisa grand day.
Go on.
If you want to be a judge, don't go around making up your own laws.
That's one.
Don't go judging the Angel of Death until he's saved your halo.
Now, that's the two I was thinking of.
What's number three?
If you really, really, reallylove somebody, always bring them back some meatballs from the wedding.
Oh, Miss Wings, I have trained you right!
Don't be shy, baby.
Come on.
Dig in.
Ooh, yes!
Look at it, Jefferson.
The elegance, the form, the sheer grace of motion.
The triumph of the human spirit.
And now, on Monster Trucking:
Tyrannosaurus Wreck will attempt to mow over nine flaming prison buses.
Boy, PBS has really changed since the Republicans took over.
Hey.
- Mail's here.
- What'd we get?
Well, you've got bills.
I got fan mail.
Oh, and I think we all know what little handyman gets Self Touchers Quarterly.
And this is for you.
Oh, a letter from the Office of Bingo Affairs.
No doubt a part of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Useless Blood-Sucking Spouses.
Al, I have been invited to the Windy City Bingo Invitational.
You know what this means?
The couch is in danger of flying away?
This is the World Series of bingo.
Top prize is $10,000.
Well, I think it's exciting, Peggy.
So you'll come to the tournament with me?
Oh, well, I would but I can't.
You see, bingo brings up sad memories for me.
I had a dog named Bingo once who died a tragic death.
I thought you had a cat named Gringo that lived to be a hundred.
Well, then I guess I can go.
Thank you so much, honey pot.
Peggy, do I have time to go home and freshen up and amend my will?
Sure.
The tournament isn't until next Tuesday.
Don't worry, Al, this isn't gonna cost you one red cent.
Good.
Give me $300.
What for?
- Bingo clothes.
- You--
Here, you Denver boot of a woman.
Hey, Peg, don't forget about dinner.
Steak?
Sounds great.
Thank you.
Bingo invitational.
Jeez, the things that excite women.
And now a word from our sponsor, Girlie Girl Beer.
The official beer of NO MA'AM.
I hope this where the girls are washing their cars and they turn their hoses on each other.
I hope it's the one where the girls are studying and then they turn the hoses on each other.
Hi, I'm Yoko Ono the new spokeshuman for Girlie Girl Beer.
Because we care about the environment Girlie Girl Beer will donate one nickel per case to save our vanishing rain forests.
And now, a song I've written.
Jefferson, give me the remote.
It wasn't enough breaking up the Beatles.
Now she's ruined our beer.
Jefferson, call an emergency meeting of the troops.
NO MA'AM must pick a new official beer.
What's going on in the garage?
Your father and the flab four are trying to come up with a new official beer.
You mean they finished their search for the official pork rind?
Peg?
We need something to cleanse the palate between beers.
Have you tried toothpaste?
No, Peg.
Toothpaste is for people who kiss, smile or eat.
Well, if you kissed, you might eat.
Yeah, but I wouldn't smile.
"Do not sell after 1989."
Hell, I'm not selling, I'm eating.
Hey, listen, Dad.
As an outsider of NO MA'AM and if there's a God, this family why do a bunch of guys who are bleary when sober need an official beer?
Bud.
While NO MA'AM may look like a loose assortment of foot pads, rakes and rapscallions we are, in fact, a proud order of dignified men who serve our community with honor and panache.
Hey, Al.
Come quick.
Ike's got an atomic fireball stuck up his nose!
Again?
Didn't he learn his lesson from the corn dog?
- Get the video camera.
- And the Dirt Devil?
No, she's reading.
Al.
Just how long are you guys gonna be Jim Carreying around in there?
I need a ride to the bingo tournament.
No, Peg.
We're picking a beer.
Can't you hitch a ride on Marcie's poultry wagon?
Al, the church is in a very dangerous neighborhood.
What could happen, Peg, a drive-by plucking?
Fine.
Then don't take me.
But I'm gonna just bust up your little beer party here and ask some stupid questions about sports.
Oh, get in the car, Peg.
And don't forget.
You gotta pick me up at 9:00.
- Fine.
- Al!
Look!
We've got British ale.
Men, don't forget.
British ale must be served warm.
This is charming, Peggy.
Thanks for inviting me.
And the women are wearing my favorite scent: dust.
Oh, just relax, Marcie.
This is gonna be fun.
Sit down and soak up the ambiance.
There is now an open chair at table nine.
Maybe I'll just play with one of these.
Touch that marker and you're gonna be eating through a straw like the rest of us.
Oh, well I guess I'll just sit here until Al comes to pick us up seven hours from now.
Squeak that chair one more time and you'll wish you were never born like the rest of us!
I-28.
Peggy, I'm feeling a little uncomfortable around Brunhilda here.
Oh, that's just Ceil.
She's really nice once you get to know her.
Offer her a potato chip.
G-57.
Would you like a chip?
Back to business.
Beer will be judged by nose, body, taste and color of exit.
And remember, no drinking.
We will sip, swish and spit.
I'll sip and spit, but I ain't gonna swish.
You'll swish and like it.
We will now commence with the official NO MA'AM beer tasting.
Jefferson, would you do the honors, please?
Gladly.
Now, our first candidate comes from Asia Minor is made from agave and bladderwort.
All right.
Our next beer is a fine Afghani ale whose name loosely translated means "yellow mountain runoff."
Oh, hey, look.
There's a prize in every can.
I'd be careful about that prize stuff.
Remember what fell out of that Chernobyl beer.
What?
That was an olive, right?
Sure, with an eyebrow.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Let's forget about this wimpy foreign beer.
We're Americans.
Let's drink American.
What's our first American beer?
Dos Equis!
N-41.
Peggy, I don't think I can sit here any longer.
Shut up.
Just relax, Marcie.
This is the last game.
Whoever wins this one gets the big jackpot.
Shut up!
G-58.
Look, Peggy, all you need is one more square.
Yeah.
But I never win anything.
I just play for fun.
N-33.
Bingo!
Bingo!
Oh, my God, bingo!
Congratulations, Peggy!
Shut up!
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the $10,000 grand prize Mrs. Peggy Bundy.
Oh, Peggy, what are you gonna do with $10,000?
Well, I think I'll give it to the needy.
Of course, I "needy" it all.
It's 9:00.
Al should be pulling up soon.
Wait, Al, look it's 9:00.
When are we gonna stop sipping and start drinking some of this stuff?
Yeah, all this beer foreplay is making me thirsty.
What's foreplay?
About 10 seconds.
Then what's sex?
All right, men.
Focus, men, focus.
All right, from now on we'll each drink a little beer.
But remember, we must still show decorum.
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Pamela Anderson.
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Pamela Anderson.
What is the problem?
You guys haven't thrown a frigging punch.
Hey, Al.
I don't wanna box anymore.
Let's dance.
When you were dancing, you wanted to box.
Oh, but-
- But when I was dancing I didn't get to lead.
Get out there, you big happy boy.
Hey, Jefferson, I got a bad feeling.
Well, heck, you had about 40 beers.
It's-
- It's a wonder you can feel anything.
No, I think I was supposed to do something around 9:00.
What time is it?
- It's 10:15.
- Oh, then I probably already done it.
Hey, Bob Rooney.
Go to the kidneys.
Go to the kidneys.
Go to the bathroom.
Go to the bathroom.
Well, staying true to his performance in bed I think it's safe to say that Al has let me down again.
Unfortunately, in this case I can't just reach into the night stand and get myself home.
Well, thank goodness we're in the comfort of a church.
Ladies, I gotta lock up.
Get out.
I thought this was a sanctuary.
Yeah, until 11.
After that, it's just another crime scene.
You don't understand.
We don't have a ride home and we're carrying $10,000 in cash.
Now, if you make us leave, there's no telling what will happen to us.
Oh, I know exactly what would happen to you.
But luckily, doctors today can reattach almost anything.
Take me.
Would you believe this isn't my real--?
Peggy!
I think we should call a cab.
You'll never get a cab this time of night.
You could get one in the morning if you wouldn't mind shacking up with me.
I got a hot plate and some macaroni and cheese.
Marcie?
Look, dream date.
There's gotta be another way out of here.
There is one other way.
My cousin Elmo drives a gypsy cab.
He can come and get you for $200.
I can't believe you are ripping us off in a sacred place.
God is gonna get you.
Yeah, there's so much more he can take from me.
Well, we are not paying $200 for a cab, you cave-dwelling pirate.
Suit yourself, bucko.
Sorry for the bumpy ride.
It's hard to steer when you're coming off drugs.
Hey, watch out!
Damn jogger.
Don't you think you should turn your headlights on?
Nope, but feel free to turn on yours.
I should report him.
What's his name?
"Dan Rostenkowski"?
Why are you stopping?
Well, you see this thing here on my leg?
I go two more blocks, I'll violate my parole we all explode together.
Which is something I've been hankering for since you two hot mamas slid into my cab.
- I think we'll just get out here.
- Fine.
My buddy Abdula will take you the rest of the way.
I find driving to be a really Zen experience.
I think the faster you go, the faster you get there.
I never knew a Geo Metro could go 140 miles an hour.
Yeah.
They corner great too.
Watch.
What a relief to be in a normal cab.
You seem like a nice person.
Well, I love my work.
- How long have you been driving?
- Seventy-two hours... straight.
Driving's helped me forget about the two-timing dirty dog who left me and took everything.
I'll have the last laugh when he finds out I wrapped his cab around a telephone pole, wearing his favorite shirt.
I got your, "She was only making the bed."
So where's Dad and the rest of the lawn sprinklers?
Well, the last time I saw, Buck was giving them all sleigh rides.
The horror.
The unspeakable horror.
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Tastes great.
Oh, look, my children.
What's-her-name and Don't-worry-about-me-I'm-on-the-pill.
Bud.
Kelly.
When your mother asks about this, and she will you tell her we just tasted one beer and went right to sheep.
What if she asks why you didn't pick up your wife?
You just tell her because she was too heavy.
Hey, pookie.
How was bingo?
It was great, Al.
I won the $10,000.
Ten thousand dollars, Peg?
Let me see it.
This is only three bucks.
Well, that's all we had left after fighting our way north via the underground railroad!
- Thank your father, kids.
- Thanks, Dad.
All this for new official beer.
That's what we forgot to do.
Pick a new official beer.
How about Girlie Girl?
- Hear, hear!
- Good choice.
Hey, boy, that was easy.
Where were we?
Hey, I know.
You guys stay put.
I'll be right back.
Al, it's 9:00.
Where are you going?
Yeah.
I gotta go pick up the wife.
INSPECTOR REX
THE BLIND WITNESS
It's 7.15.
Good morning.
Today's weather...
- Switchboard.
- Schumann speaking.
Tell me... ls there a shop near the hotel that sells hunting weapons?
Yes, there is.
- I'll look up the address.
- I'll wait.
Someone's at the door.
I'll be right back.
- Yes?
- We have to talk.
I've heard you've been in Slovakia.
- You know where I mean.
- Who are you?
That's irrelevant.
I just want to know what you're planning.
I can guess how you found out and who told you where to find me.
But I've nothing to say to you.
I don't talk to murderers.
It would be better for everyone if we could agree.
For you, perhaps.
But I saw what's going on and I'm going public.
Please leave.
- Listen, Mr Schumann.
- Out.
Or I'll call the police.
Pity...
Mr Schumann.
Get out!
Hotel Bristol.
One moment.
A call for you.
Mr Schumann?
ls everything okay?
Has something happened?
Is everything okay, Mr Schumann?
Are you all right, Mr Schumann?
Switchboard, good morning.
- Is something wrong?
- It's Mr Schumann.
- You should tell the boss.
- I'll call him.
It's Miss Heinrich here.
I think a guest's been attacked.
Hey, mind the cupboard!
I painted it myself.
That's not fair.
Right.
Come here.
Go on.
Go!
Don't complain.
Watch the ball and speed up.
Now we'll do it all again.
Now...
So you're sorry now, eh?
It's too late.
Morse here.
What's up, Stock?
Where?
We're on our way.
Rex, there's work to do.
Good morning.
Right.
You stay there.
Sit.
Good.
Two shots at close range.
We have the bullets.
- Any shells?
- No, unfortunately.
So he either used a revolver or he took the shells.
- Morning.
Hi, Stock.
- Hello, Richard.
- Where's Rex?
- In the lobby.
What happened?
Klaus Schumann, a German.
Arrived yesterday.
His company booked the room a while ago.
He was a big shot.
His secretary said he was on holiday here.
Ah, Richard.
Two shots fired into the chest cavity at a range of over 50 centimetres.
No powder burns.
Nothing.
- Any sign of a struggle?
- No.
They were facing each other.
The entry and exit wounds show the bullet went straight through.
In short, he surprised him, and bang!
- Time of death?
- About half an hour ago.
But Mr Stockinged knows more.
I'll call you again after the post-postmortem.
- Goodbye, gentlemen.
- Goodbye.
He used the pillow as a silencer.
Judging by the caliber it's a pistol.
I'll keep going-
- Anything missing?
- Quite a bit.
Money, papers, credit cards.
The hotel staff say he had a briefcase.
It's gone.
- Who found him?
- The manager.
A telephonist told him something may have happened.
Did he miss his wake-up call?
No, she seems to have heard the whole thing.
That's how we know the time of death.
Finished?
Schumann put the receiver here when he went to the door.
- Then it happened.
- Spoken to her?
No, I just got here.
- Where's the telephonist?
- Downstairs.
We can use the conference room for interviews.
She's there.
- What do you want?
- Look at this.
Hello.
My name is Morse.
I'm Brigitte Heinrich.
Good.
SO YOU saw someone...
- I'd have come sooner if...
- You'd known I'm blind?
That doesn't matter.
Treat me like a normal person.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't exactly...
That's fine.
You know, it was dreadful for me to hear it all and not be able to stop it.
- We can discuss it later.
- No, no.
It might help you find the murderer.
Right.
I start work at 9 o'clock.
Mr Schumann rang just after that... and asked about a gun shop.
I thought that was odd.
- Did he say he wanted a gun?
- No.
He just wanted to know if there was a gun shop nearby.
I said I'd look up the address.
We have Braille phone directories.
Mr Schumann said he was going to answer the door.
He thought it was room service.
And then this man came into his room.
Are you quite sure it was a man?
- And that he was alone?
- You know...
I only heard it all over the phone.
But hearing well is a must for me.
I'd recognise that man by his voice any time.
Were any names mentioned?
No.
Mr Schumann didn't know the other man.
He said "Who are you?"
But the other man used Mr Schumann name.
Was there a quarrel, an argument?
The man who came to see Mr Schumann was quiet.
It was about something Mr Schumann had found out and was about to go public with.
It was about Slovakia.
Schumann called the other man a murderer and said he wouldn't talk to him.
Do you know why he called him a murderer?
No.
The other man just said "Pity, Mr Schumann."
And then there were two muffled bangs.
I heard Mr Schumann groaning.
And then...
I don't think I can keep going.
- Could we talk tomorrow?
- Of course.
Someone will drive you home.
No, no.
I'd rather walk home.
Let's have a look.
- Richard...
- Yes.
Schumann deposited a safe key here.
All we need is the safe and we're home and hosed.
- Hello, Miss Heinrich.
- Hello.
So Schumann secretary booked a room only in Vienna?
No mention of Slovakia or other Eastern European countries.
He told her to book a room for his holiday in Vienna.
Okay.
His firm makes accessories, mainly for the car industry.
What was Schumann job?
Quality-control manager.
He was a mechanical engineer.
I've sent a query to his German colleagues.
That might help.
He must have gone to Slovakia, then come to Vienna.
A man comes into his room.
Schumann calls him a murderer, threatens to blow the whistle and is shot and killed.
There are plenty of motives.
Drugs, arms dealing, industrial espionage...
Hey, are you snoring?
It's Rex.
He pigged out at the hotel.
First of all, if I sleep at work, I'm quiet.
Secondly, we now know about the safe-deposit key.
It's from a private locker-hire company.
Mr Schumann rented the safe only yesterday.
There.
22.10.1994.
That was two days ago.
Les ice.
- Sounds like Slovakia, eh?
- It's soil and water samples.
If Schumann called the other guy a killer, that stuff's pretty dangerous...
perhaps.
Fine.
I don't know if I can just give it to you.
This is a murder case.
Count yourself lucky we're removing toxic material.
If you like, I'll stay longer.
No, thanks.
I'm feeling a bit better.
If you need anything, let me know.
Terrible... hearing someone being killed.
You really deserve sympathy.
He deserves more sympathy than I do.
Come here.
I found this in my surgery.
Would you like it?
Right.
I'm ready.
He just has to learn he can't come to the movies.
He's grumpy-
- Why?
- Ask him.
I'll make myself beautiful.
Even more beautiful?
Then we'll miss the movie.
Listen, Rex.
You can't come to the movies.
Don't get upset.
You can't always come with us.
I don't think we'll get out of here.
Then let's stay here.
What?
Okay.
- We'll stay here, then.
- What?
We'll stay here, then.
If Rex doesn't want us to go, we must stay here.
In the meantime, we've hidden the load until we can bring it over.
What happened to Schumann was unavoidable.
He wanted to blow the whistle.
I took his documents with me.
Good.
I'll dispose of them.
By the way, have the police called yet?
Damn.
And?
Yes?
Very good.
The samples had high levels of potassium cyanide.
It's used in metalwork and galvanizing.
The waste product contains cyanide.
Then it could come from Schumann company.
But they know nothing and said their lawyer would call.
Les ice is a tiny place just over the border.
A few houses and no industry.
The stuff must have been taken there.
It's becoming common for that special waste shit to be dumped in Eastern Europe.
The elegant disposal of toxic waste!
Maybe he found out and was about to go public.
It fits with what the telephonist heard.
I'll go there.
I'm more likely to find out.
Just like that?
Yes.
You can mind Rex.
I may have to stay the night.
No way.
Leave him with your vet girlfriend.
She's busy.
See how much he likes you.
Sorry, but I have to look after your master.
I'm coming to Slovakia with you.
- Please.
- Okay, but leave Rex alone.
Rex, we're going to Miss Heinrich's place.
Hello, Miss Heinrich.
- Your neighbour sent me here.
- Hello, Mr Morse.
Do come in.
- Nice hiding place.
- ls someone with you?
Just my dog.
- His name is Rex.
- Rex?
Come here, Rex.
What a beautiful dog.
He's so big.
German shepherd?
I once had a dog, for ten years.
- Oh?
- Sadly, he died.
Some relatives gave him to me shortly after my accident.
Was he a guide dog?
He wasn't trained or anything, but he was a great help.
Then why didn't you get another one?
Losing him was so terrible.
I'm afraid of going through that again.
We were always together.
I even took him to work.
His name was Ark.
He was a German shepherd too.
Sometimes I think I'd like to have a dog again.
I wouldn't be so lonely.
I'm going to Slovakia for a couple of days...
I have to leave Rex somewhere.
If it's not a nuisance for you... could you...
Could he possibly stay with you?
- You'd leave him with me?
- Why not?
I'd love that.
- He'd take my mind off things.
- He could walk with you.
It would be a bit like before, when I had Ark.
But I'm sure you're not just here to leave Rex with me.
That's true, unfortunately.
I thought of something else.
Mr Schumann said
"I've seen what's going on down there
"and I can imagine where you get your information."
I think Schumann was onto some people who transport toxic waste to Eastern Europe.
But can you think of anything about the other man?
Yes, but I don't know if it will be much help.
He speaks very slowly.
That is something.
Thank you, Miss Heinrich.
So it's all set.
Rex, you stay here.
I'll be back soon.
I'll bring you a present.
I'll take good care of him.
- I hope so.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
He'll be back soon.
I'll look after you until then, Rex.
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.
Thanks, Rex.
Come on.
I had two ham rolls somewhere.
Just as well Rex isn't here.
Where are you?
What is it, Rex?
Let's keep going.
Oh, I see.
You want me to throw it for you.
I hope I don't hit anyone.
Watch out!
If anyone asks, Heller will say we're out investigating.
- I hope he doesn't say where.
- Of course not.
You couldn't be bothered filling out forms.
It wasn't that.
It was having to wait for an answer.
This wasn't here yesterday.
I have to get my bearings.
Good, Rex.
We should have contacted the Slovak authorities.
We're here unofficially.
Besides, they may know nothing.
It would probably take ages to explain what we want.
Exactly.
I barely know enough Slovak to order dinner.
Wait here.
I'll just get my radio.
They promised to repair it immediately.
What's "the bill" in Slovak?
Let me think.
It's...
Call Heller and tell him to stay at the office.
Car 741.
Come in, Control.
Thanks.
Over.
Lucky Bratislava only 30 minutes from Vienna.
It's almost 12.
We must hurry.
Come, Rex.
Come on.
What's up, Rex?
Is something wrong?
Is everything all right now?
It's me.
It went wrong.
- She has a dog with her.
- Shit.
Then think of something else.
Our man in Germany has phoned again.
He's getting nervous.
If this gets out, we'll lose that client.
Do you think Dr Basswood knows about the toxic waste?
Who else, if not the doctor?
He wouldn't say anything on the phone, but...
Let's see.
After all, he does treat the locals.
We're looking for Dr Basswood.
That's me.
We have to go down there.
They sink the barrels here.
It's been going on for some time.
How did you find out?
The children from around here were coming to my surgery with symptoms for which there was no logical explanation.
Headaches, stomach cramps, dizziness and asthma.
Could they be caused by cyanide poisoning?
That's certainly possible.
Unfortunately, I'm not able to analyst the water.
But if the contents of the barrels have got into the ground water then this whole area is contaminated.
There have already been fatalities.
Dr Basswood...
Why didn't you inform the authorities?
I tried, but I was threatened.
And...
I do have a family, after all.
But when that Mr Schumann was here
I gave him some documents.
They vanished from his room after he was murdered.
Do you know... who brings the waste?
A man from Vienna.
I saw him with our mayor at the pub.
- Who is this man?
- Janice.
He comes from here.
He moved to Austria a few years ago.
He tries to cover up his accent by speaking really slowly.
It was him in the hotel room.
- Where can we find him?
- He has a business in Vienna.
He doesn't deliver the waste himself.
He gets a Slovak firm to pick it up from Vienna.
And you told Mr Schumann all this?
Yes.
He was here a few days ago.
He thought the barrels came from his company.
Officially they went to a waste disposal company but unofficially Janice dumped them here.
Schumann thought someone from his firm was on the take.
Behind you, on the left.
Visitors?
There are people here who want nothing to change.
They told Janice about Schumann, so they'll tell him we were here.
- We must call Heller at once.
- Let's do it.
You can call from my surgery.
We'll tell the Slovak police and make sure you're okay.
Janice's firm is actually in the phone book.
Right.
We'll put a 24-hour watch on him.
Simmer can pretend to be a customer wanting Janice.
Then we'll know what he looks like.
See you.
We should have arrested Janice at once.
Only to release him within half a day?
No one at the hotel saw anyone suspicious.
We know he used a pistol and took the shells with him.
He wouldn't leave them around.
They'll be in the Danube.
We've got nothing on him.
Unless the telephonist recognizes his voice.
It's Heller.
Janice's leaving in his car.
It's me again.
Janice has a truck hidden here.
He's just driven off in it.
He's heading for the freeway.
I'll tail him.
But he won't do anything until it's dark.
Richard?
I've got through at last.
Where are you now?
Near Vienna.
That's good.
Janice's heading for the Danube, probably to dump some waste.
Listen.
Take the freeway exit for the tanker terminal.
I think he'll stop there.
No.
I'll wait at a safe distance until you arrive.
Hurry, and park a long way from the river, or they'll hear you.
I'll park in the bushes near the truck.
See you.
We must hurry.
Angle the ramp so the barrels roll into the river.
Bring the barrels to the ramp.
- At last.
- What's up?
Janice's dumping toxic waste into the Danube.
- I've called Emergency.
- We can't wait.
Not one barrel must be dumped.
Those barrels are meant for Slovakia, aren't they...
Mr Janice?
- Did you get lost?
- None of that.
Stop!
Not deserting your boss, are you?
Let's go.
Schumann was right.
The barrels are from the firm he worked for.
He saw what was going on with the toxic waste.
A certain Dr Schneider is responsible for waste disposal.
He told you everything Schumann was doing.
I don't mind paying a fine for polluting the Danube.
Oh?
But Schumann murder will cost you dearly.
You have to prove that.
That was a nice walk, Rex.
It's almost time for dinner.
Come, Rex.
I know what happened.
Someone tried to run me over.
He's still there, isn't he?
Come on, Rex.
Come, Rex.
You must be very quiet now.
He didn't see us.
Stay calm, Rex.
So...
There you are.
Miss Heinrich?
- Mr Morse.
- Hello.
Hello.
Did it help that I recognised the killer's voice?
Of course.
It was easier to get him to confess.
His German accomplice confessed too.
Dr Basswood got the authorities to send the waste back.
Good.
And how's Rex?
Fine.
Oh, yes.
I've brought you something.
- What?
- Something special.
He's yours.
My dog handler mates will turn him into a guide dog.
- Okay?
- Thank you.
Shake hands.
Someone else has been killed.
Well, I've got the perfect alibi, then, haven't I?
Do you not feel sorry for her?
Yes.
But I'm sorry for me, as well.
You didn't kill this poor woman that's just been found.
You didn't kill Joyce Watkins.
But you did kill Jean Mcllvanney.
I didn't.
Why Shirley Temple?
Don't you lie to me!
I know you did it!
No, don't you put it down.
Don't you put the phone down!
So, what age were you when you met?
18.
She was 16.
- Virgin?
- Me?
No.
- Maggie.
- I don't know.
You didn't ask?
No.
I don't believe you.
Did she say she was?
- Yes.
- Did you believe her?
Yes.
You didn't believe her.
Low self-esteem, you see.
If she'd let you screw her, she can't be choosy.
There must have been lots of other men before you.
Did you despise her afterwards?
Slut!
To let you do that to her...
You can tell me.
I'm a good Catholic boy.
Yes.
Is that why Shirley Temple turns you on?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- To be the very first.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Best of all, to be first and last.
The very first.
Screw a virgin, slaughter her.
The first and last.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You killed those two women!
I didn't.
You're lying.
I'm going to the police.
- You knew David was seeing prostitutes.
- I didn't.
- You knew for years, and you didn't tell me.
- I didn't know.
You killed my child.
You killed my Peter.
For God's sake, Maggle!
You killed my child - as good as killed him.
Come with me to the police station.
I want you to tell them everything.
Oh, I'll tell them everything.
- That's good.
- You're an accomplice.
What?
You told David what to do - to think of an alibi.
And when the police came round, you told him to burn the car and report It stolen.
If I talk to the police, you're finished.
My goodness!

Why didn't you give her one?
I wanted to ask her a few questions.

- That's enough, Jane.
OK?
You wanted a bit of company?
I didn't want company.
She thinks you're a sad bastard.
All right.

I gave her one.
I dldrt want company.
I asked her a few questions, and I gave her one.
I gave her several.

Well, I've a bit of a pain in my arse, but that might have something to do with you.
Does that pass for wit in Belfast?
No, I only ask, because you don't look too good, Jimmy.
- Have you looked in the mirror lately?
- (Chuckles)
A little blue in the lips - that's all.
It's OK, unless you get a tingling down your left arm.
You haven't got that?
(Beck hums)
Have I said the wrong thing?
You don't have a tingling in your arm, do you?
If you do have a tingling, it could mean an impending heart attack.
♪ Come fly with me - let's fly, let's fly away
Could be it, Jimmy.
Could be it.
♪ Come fly with me - let's fly, let's fly away
I gave you a wee bit of a fright, didn't I?
Sorry.
Blood pressure up, heart rate up.
Just a little, but you can feel it.
Huh?

Oxygen required, Jimmy.
Oxygen required.
You haven't taken in enough, though, have you?
Hmm?

Something wrong.
Little messages all over your body.
Adrenalin required.
Adrenalin required.
Hmm?
What are you gonna do with that adrenalin?
Fight or flight?
But there's nobody to fight.
There's nowhere to run to.
Hmm?

Hmm?
Arteries narrowing, blood pressure sky-high, heart rate up, up!

More oxygen, Jimmy!
More oxygen.
But you can't have any, cos your lungs have ceased to function - it's called hyperventilation, Jimmy.
Every single nerve in your body is screaming the same message - something wrong!
Life or death!

Your arteries are getting smaller.

Bilborough died because I showed a villain a bit of compassion.
And that's all I wanted in return.
A bit of compassion.
A bit of understanding.
From her.
But I got none.
She despised me for it.
- She loved him.
- I did too.
She can turn compassion on and off like a tap.
They all can.
Women?
I was 14 when I came over here.
I took a lot of stick.
You know.
"Paddy." "Mick." "Get back to the bog."
I knew what I had to do to earn a bit of respect.
Throw a few punches and take a few punches.
But I didn't.
I hung around with the girls because, well, they showed a bit of compassion, you see, and and I fell for it.
And a month passed, and I wasrt a fresh face any more, and they dumped me.
And I had to take the punches.
And it was worse now, because they were harder, because...
I'd been hanging around with the girls.
Women need rape.
- I'm listening.
- It's their weapon.
A woman goes up to the heavyweight champion of the world.
Hotel bedroom.
Early hours of the morning.
He gives her one.
He gets done for rape, ends up in the nick.
The heavyweight champion!
One of the bravest men.
If It can happen to him, It can happen to any of us.
And that's what they want.
It's their weapon.
They want to keep us on our toes.
Penaligon needs rape.
- Needs raping?
- Needs rape.
It's her department.
Her little empire.
She thinks she can treat me like muck when it's rape, because she's a woman, and we don't understand.
That's bollocks.
She knew nothing about rape.
So, you thought you'd teach her something about it?
- This is in confidence?
- Yep.
- Strict confidence?
- Yeah.
Doctor-patient.
I don't believe you.
- Strict confidence, Jimmy.
- Swear.
- Bloody, bloody, bloody.
- Swear on the life of your wife and children.
I swear on the life of my wife and children that I will not repeat anything you tell me.
Swear on the life of your newborn baby.
- You're sick.
- I'm sick?
I swear on the life of my newborn baby that I will not repeat anything you tell me.
I never intended to rape her.
As God Is my judge, I never Intended It.
I just wanted to... frighten her.
I was going to pull the mask off at the last minute, you know, and laugh in her face.
But something happened and... she looked so...
- Vulnerable?
- Vulnerable, and weak, and frightened.
And I felt so... powerful.
You want to know the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.
I never had such an erection in my life.
I realised that... that I could do lt.
That I could rape her, and... get away with it.
Just walk away from it.
And... that's... that's why I did it.
Because I could.
I raped her because... because I could.
You'd have done the same thing.
Every man I know would have done it.
- Did you speak to him?
- Yeah.
And?
Nothing.
(Bleep)
I had a gun in his mouth.
I couldn't pull the trigger, but that was OK, because he didn't know that.
I was still the one in control.
Then he pulled it himself.
Looked me in the eye, laughed in my face.
And I knew what he was thinking - I didn't have the guts.
Well, I did have the guts.
I just didn't have the callousness.
The callousness required to blow somebody's head off, to rape.
His kind of callousness.
OK, I stuck a gun in his mouth, but I never did get even.
£15,000.
What for?
The house is won'th 30,000.

About 20 times altogether, I suppose.
I'm not sure.

I'd have to go all coy.
Then he'd start screaming, "Slut, slag," all that sort of stuff.
Then he'd strip me.
Straight sex.
Me on top.
Why are you interested in him, anyway?
Have you got names for them all?
Just the pervs.

To take all that money off a man and call him a perv behind his back?

You know, you really should put in for Pope, Dan.
What are you gonna do with it?
Why do you always look at me as if I've just farted?
You don't deserve her.
You don't deserve those kids.
You know something, Danny?
Everybody respects you.
Everybody respects good old dependable Dan, but nobody loves him.
Nobody ever pitied my wife.
(Phone rings)
JUDITH:
Hello?
OK.
Bye.
Stick insect's been on.
They need your help.
I won't be long.
Don't forget your cape.
A grown-up woman pretending to be a little girl.
She told me how often David had been with her and how often he'd been with all the others.
I saw blood.
Her face was covered in blood... and I realised that I had picked something up and I was hitting her.
I just couldn't stop hitting her.
Why, Maggie?
Sexual disgust?
You felt betrayed?
Money.
I don't believe that.
Money's life and death.
Money's blood.
I'd killed her.
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't understand it.
I went home and after a while I could understand it.
What have you always told me, Michael?
Poverty, disease, the death of a child - try and see some purpose In It all?
And I did see a purpose.
I found a chisel.
David's sperm?
We did make love that night, but not for the reason you said.
He knew it was going to be the last.
I went back to her flat.
The door was still open.
I hit her with the chisel put Davld's sperm Inside her, and put the chisel Inside her.
She was alive when you did that.
She died In hospital.
Do you know how you got away with it for so long?
It wasrt the sperm.
It was the chisel.
That had to be a man.
No woman could do that to another woman.
But you had to do lt, you forced yourself to, because that's what your husband did.
Dld you think about him when you stuck It In?
You dldrt think about them, of course.
Joyce, Paula.
You had to despise them, think of them as not quite human.
Yes?
Dld you think about your own daughters?
Course not.
They were somebody's daughters.
There would be a mother somewhere, sobbing.
What did you think about, Maggie?
What could drive you?
What could madden you so much to do something like that?
Peter.
Who's Peter?
They were all Peter.
Joe, Matthew, Theresa, Joan.
I called them all Peter before they were born.
Peter died?
I killed Peter.
Before he was born?
An abortion?
But that's not a crime, is it?
The murder of an innocent baby isn't a crime.
And the murder of a filthy prostitute Is.
You love David.
You love a man.
You make love with a man.
You have a baby.
But babies cost money.
And there's never enough money, so you talk about abortion.
You go and see Mlchael for his advice.
What does Mlchael say?
Michael says that we will always be welcome in his church, no matter what we do.
I was trying to make it easier for you.
MAGGIE:
I didn't want it made easier.
I wanted you to say no.
I'm a good Cathollc.
I believe.
I go along to my priest, a lifetime of sacrifice, and all I ask is that he protect my unborn child.
- But he wort.
- I...
I did the best I could.
For David.
David cried after we got rid of the baby.
And it helped, because it made me realise that it was hard for him too.
He was sharing the pain.
And then you found out that there was enough money, after all.
He wasrt sharing the pain.
He wasrt crying for our baby.
It was guilt.
There was enough money, after all.
But he was spending it all on those bloody women.
You ask me how I could put a chisel In another woman.
It was easy, when I thought of my baby.
Cos whatever mess I made of them, it was nothing, compared to what they did to my baby.
Are you ready to tell all this to the police?
Yes.
I killed the woman called Joyce.
I killed the woman called Paula.
I killed Jean Mcllvanney.
FITZ:
I know that's a lle.
I killed Jean Mcllvanney.
I killed the woman called...
Your husband killed Jean Mcllvanney.
You killed Joyce, you killed Paula.
I killed them all.
You're worried about the kids.
I followed him.
I saw him pick up Jean Mcllvanney.
I saw them try to get money from the cashpoint.
Everythlng happened exactly as you said except, I killed Jean Mcllvanney.
It's a bit daft, both of you going down.
You don't stand a chance.
You got caught red-handed.
Confess to all three - he'll get out and look after the children.
Is that lt?
I'm telling the truth.
Two victims, three victims...
Doesrt make much difference, hm?
It does, Maggie.
It will.
In 10, 1 5 years'tlme.
Trust me - a parole board likes a good motive.
"Here's a woman.
She killed twice so her husband could get out of prison.
I can understand that."
But three times?
Out of spite?
Out of hatred?
They'll let you rot.
I killed Jean Mcllvanney.
Do you believe in heaven, Maggie?
Yes.
And hell?
Yes.
And I'd burn in hell for eternity to protect my children.
I killed Jean Mcllvanney.
I killed the woman called Joyce.
I killed the woman called Paula.
My husband is innocent.
Please let him go home and look after my children.
- He did it!
- Can you prove it?
- Yes, if you give us a bit more time!
- Can you prove it now?
What have you got?
Identification.
But Identlflcatlors useless.
No-one's denying he had sex with the woman.
The question Is.' did he kill her?
- Yes!
He did.
- Well, we need a little more than your opinion.
- They're gonna let him go.
- He was the last man to see her.
No-one's denying that, either.
But he wasrt the last person to see her alive.
The last person to see her alive was his own bloody wife.
- And she's a bloody liar!
- Convince me.
Look, it's not our problem, and you know what I mean.
We pass all this over to the CPS.
We let them deal with it.
We haven't got a case!
No forensic, nothing!
Nothing to link him with the crime.
- They're gonna let the bastard go!
- Cool it.
- What?
- I said, cool it.
Who do you think you are, eh?
Who are you trying to impress?
- I'm just asking you to cool it.
- Are you trying to impress Lady Jane here?
- I'm just asking you to cool it.
That's all.
- You're a DC, right?
You're not a DI now.
You're a DC, and I'm a DS, so don't even try.
Don't even try to score points off me.
Right?
Right.
WISE:
We'll think of something.
- You'll let that man go!
- What?
- Nothing.
- We're letting David Harvey go.
OK?
- (Groans)
He's not the first man to get off scot-free, Jimmy.
- Do you want him punished?
- You bloody hypocrite!
Do you want him punished?
He's guilty, so you must.
- For God's sake, let her go.
- Just piss off, Jimmy!
I just want to hear whether or not you want him punished.
(Scouse accent) 'Ey!
Calm down!
- Stay out of this.
- What is wrong with you?
He's guilty, right?
And I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I just want to hear you say yes or bloody no.
- Aye-aye?
- I just want her to answer the question!
What the hell do you think you are?
Jeremy bloody Paxman?
When I was a kid, it was all in Latin.
I used to think the priest was saying, "I bet I can beat you at dominoes."
When the plate came round, I thought they were collecting the bets.
- Why are you still pursuing him?
- I'm pursuing the truth.
People who spout about the truth are usually the biggest liars in the world.
Does it bother you that he got away with murder?
He'll remember that night for as long as he lives.
He's lost his wife because of it.
Hls kids have lost their mother because of lt.
How has he got away with it?
You'll see yourselves out.
- I'm gonna make my mother a millionaire.
- At the casino?
- Bang on.
- You promised you wouldn't gamble again.
This doesn't count.
- Cheap sentimentality!
- I'll explain later.
Cheap sentimentality!
(Tyres squealing)
- Mr Harvey?
- Yeah.
- You're under arrest.
- What for?
- Get in the car.
- What for?
- Get in the car!
- Jesus!
Get in!
I'll tell you why I joined the police force, Mr Harvey.
When I was a kid, there was a copper who used to walked up and down our street.
That was when coppers could walk up and down our street.
He was a big man.
If you kept your nose clean, you'd be all right.
If you stepped out of line, you got a clip round the ear.
Everyone respected him.
I wanted to be like that man.
But I cart be like that man.
They've all gone.
Those days are all gone.
Nowadays, if you give someone a clip round the ear, you end up in court.
I know men who've been killed.
- Let me out of this car.
- I know men who've been killed.
Good men.
Better men than me.
Better coppers than me.
Their killers are still living.
Oh, they're banged up, yeah, but they're still living.
They're treated like bloody heroes, because they killed a copper.
Well, I believe in atonement, Mr Harvey.
If you're guilty, you should atone.
And we're both guilty, Mr Harvey.
I'm with the suspect, David Harvey.
I'm taking him to the roof of the Ramada Hotel.
We're gonna jump off together.
Over.
Jimmy, what the hell are you playing at?
Jlmmy, what the bloody hell are you playing at?
Over.
You're not fit to lick Bilborough's boots, never mind fill them, you scruffy Scouse bastard!
I want an ARV at the hotel.
If he looks like jumping, shoot the bastard.
He's threatening to jump and take Davld Harvey with him.
Over.
Victor Oscar One to control.
We're just round the corner.
I'm on my way.
Over.
(Siren)
(Tyres screech)
- Get out of the car, Mr Harvey.
- No.
Get out of the car!
Get out, before I blow your bloody brains out.
No!
I've got four children!
I've got four children waiting at home for me!
You owe me nothing, but think of my kids!
Get out!
Police.
Get out.
Go on.
Will you help me, please?
Help me!
For God's sake, do something!
He's gonna kill me!
He's gonna kill me!
He's gonna kill me!
I'm gonna take you right to the top, Mr Harvey, and if you don't confess, I'm gonna push you off.
Does that make you feel like confessing, Mr Harvey?
Did you kill Jean Mcllvanney?
Trouble is, it's confession under duress.
Inadmissible.
The judge'll throw it out.
That's the way it is these days.
Everything is designed to get you off.
There's... there's a wonderful...
Oh, what's the word I'm looking for?
Irony.
There's a wonderful irony, isn't there, Mr Harvey?
Because everything is designed to get you off, you're the one who's going to have to die.
Do you appreciate that irony, Mr Harvey?
Aaaarghh!
(Sirens)
(Police radio chatter)
This is evidence.
This is a dying mars statement.
FITZ:
Come on.
PENHALIGON:
Find the passenger lift, Fitz.

Isn't that right, Mr Harvey?
Mr Harvey has just nodded his head.

I'm so sorry.

(Wailing)
Someone else has been killed.
Well, I've got the perfect alibi, then, haven't I?
Do you not feel sorry for her?
Yes.
But I'm sorry for me, as well.
You didn't kill this poor woman that's just been found.
You didn't kill Joyce Watkins.
But you did kill Jean McIlvanney.
I didn't.
Why Shirley Temple?
Don't you lie to me!
I know you did it!
No, don't you put it down.
Don't you put the phone down!
So, what age were you when you met?
18.
She was 16.
- Virgin?
- Me?
No.
- Maggie.
- I don't know.
You didn't ask?
No.
I don't believe you.
Did she say she was?
- Yes.
- Did you believe her?
Yes.
You didn't believe her.
Low self-esteem, you see.
If she'd let you screw her, she can't be choosy.
There must have been lots of other men before you.
Did you despise her afterwards?
Slut!
To let you do that to her...
You can tell me.
I'm a good Catholic boy.
Yes.
Is that why Shirley Temple turns you on?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- To be the very first.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Best of all, to be first and last.
The very first.
Screw a virgin, slaughter her.
The first and last.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You killed those two women!
I didn't.
You're lying.
I'm going to the police.
- You knew David was seeing prostitutes.
- I didn't.
- You knew for years, and you didn't tell me.
- I didn't know.
You killed my child.
You killed my Peter.
For God's sake, Maggle!
You killed my child - as good as killed him.
Come with me to the police station.
I want you to tell them everything.
Oh, I'll tell them everything.
- That's good.
- You're an accomplice.
What?
You told David what to do - to think of an alibi.
And when the police came round, you told him to burn the car and report It stolen.
If I talk to the police, you're finished.
My goodness!
WISE:

One, sir.
Why didn't you give her one, Jimmy?
- What?
- Denise Fletcher.
Why didn't you give her one?
I wanted to ask her a few questions.
- You slept with her.
- That's enough, Jane.
OK?
You wanted a bit of company?
I didn't want company.
She thinks you're a sad bastard.
All right.
I admit it.
I gave her one.
I didn't want company.
I asked her a few questions, and I gave her one.
I gave her several.

How are you?
Well, I've a bit of a pain in my arse, but that might have something to do with you.
Does that pass for wit in Belfast?
No, I only ask, because you don't look too good, Jimmy.
- Have you looked in the mirror lately?
- (Chuckles)
A little blue in the lips - that's all.
It's OK, unless you get a tingling down your left arm.
You haven't got that?
(Beck hums)
Have I said the wrong thing?
You don't have a tingling in your arm, do you?
If you do have a tingling, it could mean an impending heart attack.
Come fly with me - let's fly, let's fly away
Could be it, Jimmy.
Could be it.
Come fly with me - let's fly, let's fly away
I gave you a wee bit of a fright, didn't I?
Sorry.
Blood pressure up, heart rate up.
Just a little, but you can feel it.
Huh?
Come fly with me...
Oxygen required, Jimmy.
Oxygen required.
You haven't taken in enough, though, have you?
Hmm?
Body's still crying out, "More oxygen!" Something wrong.
Something wrong.
Little messages all over your body.
Adrenalin required.
Adrenalin required.
Hmm?
What are you gonna do with that adrenalin?
Fight or flight?
But there's nobody to fight.
There's nowhere to run to.
Hmm?
What's the adrenalin doing to your body now?
Hmm?
Arteries narrowing, blood pressure sky-high, heart rate up, up!
(Panting)
More oxygen, Jimmy!
More oxygen.
But you can't have any, cos your lungs have ceased to function - it's called hyperventilation, Jimmy.
Every single nerve in your body is screaming the same message - something wrong!
Life or death!
More adrenalin, more adrenalin!
You know what the adrenalin's doing to you, Jimmy?
Your arteries are getting smaller.
Your heart's pumping!
Your blood pressure is going up and up and up.
Your head's swimming.
You're going to die, Jimmy.
You are going to die!
Get it off your chest.
Guilt suffocates!
Get it off your chest.
You have to tell me!
Tell me.
I'll tell no-one else.
I promise I will help you!
I'll help you.
(Panting) Yes!
Yeah!
Yeah...
Look, breathe, breathe.
Blow, blow, blow in.

WISE:

Oh, he's right home now.

Bilborough died because I showed a villain a bit of compassion.
And that's all I wanted in return.
A bit of compassion.
A bit of understanding.
From her.
But I got none.
She despised me for it.
- She loved him.
- I did too.
She can turn compassion on and off like a tap.
They all can.
Women?
I was 14 when I came over here.
I took a lot of stick.
You know.
"Paddy." "Mick." "Get back to the bog."
I knew what I had to do to earn a bit of respect.
Throw a few punches and take a few punches.
But I didn't.
I hung around with the girls because, well, they showed a bit of compassion, you see, and and I fell for it.
And a month passed, and I wasn't a fresh face any more, and they dumped me.
And I had to take the punches.
And it was worse now, because they were harder, because...
I'd been hanging around with the girls.
Women need rape.
- I'm listening.
- It's their weapon.
A woman goes up to the heavyweight champion of the world.
Hotel bedroom.
Early hours of the morning.
He gives her one.
He gets done for rape, ends up in the nick.
The heavyweight champion!
One of the bravest men.
If It can happen to him, It can happen to any of us.
And that's what they want.
It's their weapon.
They want to keep us on our toes.
Penaligon needs rape.
- Needs raping?
- Needs rape.
It's her department.
Her little empire.
She thinks she can treat me like muck when it's rape, because she's a woman, and we don't understand.
That's bollocks.
She knew nothing about rape.
So, you thought you'd teach her something about it?
- This is in confidence?
- Yep.
- Strict confidence?
- Yeah.
Doctor-patient.
I don't believe you.
- Strict confidence, Jimmy.
- Swear.
- Bloody, bloody, bloody.
- Swear on the life of your wife and children.
I swear on the life of my wife and children that I will not repeat anything you tell me.
Swear on the life of your newborn baby.
- You're sick.
- I'm sick?
I swear on the life of my newborn baby that I will not repeat anything you tell me.
I never intended to rape her.
As God Is my judge, I never Intended lt.
I just wanted to... frighten her.
I was going to pull the mask off at the last minute, you know, and laugh in her face.
But something happened and... she looked so...
- Vulnerable?
- Vulnerable, and weak, and frightened.
And I felt so... powerful.
You want to know the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.
I never had such an erection in my life.
I realised that... that I could do lt.
That I could rape her, and... get away with it.
Just walk away from it.
And... that's... that's why I did it.
Because I could.
I raped her because... because I could.
You'd have done the same thing.
Every man I know would have done it.
- Did you speak to him?
- Yeah.
And?
Nothing.
(Bleep)
I had a gun in his mouth.
I couldn't pull the trigger, but that was OK, because he didn't know that.
I was still the one in control.
Then he pulled it himself.
Looked me in the eye, laughed in my face.
And I knew what he was thinking - I didn't have the guts.
Well, I did have the guts.
I just didn't have the callousness.
The callousness required to blow somebody's head off, to rape.
His kind of callousness.
OK, I stuck a gun in his mouth, but I never did get even.
?
15,000.
What for?
The house is won'th 30,000.
Half of it's yours.
Ah...
Don't want it.

How many drinks have you had?
I've just seen Maggie Harvey.
She asked me the way to Webster Road.

She's lying.
You're lying.
How much did you charge him?

40.
I'd ask for 50; he'd knock me down to 40.

About 20 times altogether, I suppose.
I'm not sure.
- What did you do?
- Straight sex.
I'd have to go all coy.
Then he'd start screaming, "Slut, slag," all that sort of stuff.
Then he'd strip me.
Straight sex.
Me on top.
Why are you interested in him, anyway?
Have you got names for them all?
Just the pervs.
Do you think that's right?
To take all that money off a man and call him a perv behind his back?
Who are you, love?
Mother Teresa?
I mean, you let him do those things to you.
Doesrt that make you worse?
Well, enough of this small talk...
You even advertise lt.
You advertise filth for sale, and then you have the cheek to criticise the man who buys it.

You called him a pervert.

Stick insect.
- Now and again, yeah.
- What about?
Just to say hello and that.
Did she ask about me?
No.
- Did you like her?
- No.
Why not?
Because.
Did he make her laugh?
Look, he's stupid.
She's young enough to be his daughter, so forget it.
I can't.
Did you talk to your dad about her?
Yeah.
And?
I told him he was acting like a pillock.
He agreed.
Said he couldn't help it.
He said he couldn't help it?
Yeah.
He said that he couldn't help it?
Yep.
JUDITH:
Do you think she's good-looking?
She scared the shit out of the Romans.
(Doorbell)
- Hi.
- ?
15,000.
You want a drink?
You want me to want a drink.
That way you can have one.
You know, you really should put in for Pope, Dan.
What are you gonna do with it?
Why do you always look at me as if I've just farted?
You don't deserve her.
You don't deserve those kids.
You know something, Danny?
Everybody respects you.
Everybody respects good old dependable Dan, but nobody loves him.
Nobody ever pitied my wife.
(Phone rings)
JUDITH:
Hello?
OK.
Bye.
Stick insect's been on.
They need your help.
I won't be long.
Don't forget your cape.
A grown-up woman pretending to be a little girl.
She told me how often David had been with her and how often he'd been with all the others.
I saw blood.
Her face was covered in blood... and I realised that I had picked something up and I was hitting her.
I just couldn't stop hitting her.
Why, Maggie?
Sexual disgust?
You felt betrayed?
Money.
I don't believe that.
Money's life and death.
Money's blood.
I'd killed her.
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't understand it.
I went home and after a while I could understand it.
What have you always told me, Michael?
Poverty, disease, the death of a child - try and see some purpose In It all?
And I did see a purpose.
I found a chisel.
David's sperm?
We did make love that night, but not for the reason you said.
He knew it was going to be the last.
I went back to her flat.
The door was still open.
I hit her with the chisel put David's sperm inside her, and put the chisel Inside her.
She was alive when you did that.
She died In hospital.
Do you know how you got away with it for so long?
It wasn't the sperm.
It was the chisel.
That had to be a man.
No woman could do that to another woman.
But you had to do lt, you forced yourself to, because that's what your husband did.
Did you think about him when you stuck it in?
You didn't think about them, of course.
Joyce, Paula.
You had to despise them, think of them as not quite human.
Yes?
Did you think about your own daughters?
Course not.
They were somebody's daughters.
There would be a mother somewhere, sobbing.
What did you think about, Maggie?
What could drive you?
What could madden you so much to do something like that?
Peter.
Who's Peter?
They were all Peter.
Joe, Matthew, Theresa, Joan.
I called them all Peter before they were born.
Peter died?
I killed Peter.
Before he was born?
An abortion?
But that's not a crime, is it?
The murder of an innocent baby isn't a crime.
And the murder of a filthy prostitute Is.
You love David.
You love a man.
You make love with a man.
You have a baby.
But babies cost money.
And there's never enough money, so you talk about abortion.
You go and see Mlchael for his advice.
What does Mlchael say?
Michael says that we will always be welcome in his church, no matter what we do.
I was trying to make it easier for you.
MAGGIE:
I didn't want it made easier.
I wanted you to say no.
I'm a good Cathollc.
I believe.
I go along to my priest, a lifetime of sacrifice, and all I ask is that he protect my unborn child.
- But he wort.
- I...
I did the best I could.
For David.
David cried after we got rid of the baby.
And it helped, because it made me realise that it was hard for him too.
He was sharing the pain.
And then you found out that there was enough money, after all.
He wasn't sharing the pain.
He wasn't crying for our baby.
It was guilt.
There was enough money, after all.
But he was spending it all on those bloody women.
You ask me how I could put a chisel In another woman.
It was easy, when I thought of my baby.
Cos whatever mess I made of them, it was nothing, compared to what they did to my baby.
Are you ready to tell all this to the police?
Yes.
I killed the woman called Joyce.
I killed the woman called Paula.
I killed Jean McIlvanney.
FITZ:
I know that's a lle.
I killed Jean McIlvanney.
I killed the woman called...
Your husband killed Jean McIlvanney.
You killed Joyce, you killed Paula.
I killed them all.
You're worried about the kids.
I followed him.
I saw him pick up Jean McIlvanney.
I saw them try to get money from the cashpoint.
Everything happened exactly as you said except, I killed Jean McIlvanney.
It's a bit daft, both of you going down.
You don't stand a chance.
You got caught red-handed.
Confess to all three - he'll get out and look after the children.
Is that lt?
I'm telling the truth.
Two victims, three victims...
Doesrt make much difference, hm?
It does, Maggie.
It will.
In 10, 1 5 years'tlme.
Trust me - a parole board likes a good motive.
"Here's a woman.
She killed twice so her husband could get out of prison.
I can understand that."
But three times?
Out of spite?
Out of hatred?
They'll let you rot.
I killed Jean McIlvanney.
Do you believe in heaven, Maggie?
Yes.
And hell?
Yes.
And I'd burn in hell for eternity to protect my children.
I killed Jean McIlvanney.
I killed the woman called Joyce.
I killed the woman called Paula.
My husband is innocent.
Please let him go home and look after my children.
- He did it!
- Can you prove it?
- Yes, if you give us a bit more time!
- Can you prove it now?
What have you got?
Identification.
But Identlflcatlors useless.
No-one's denying he had sex with the woman.
The question Is.' did he kill her?
- Yes!
He did.
- Well, we need a little more than your opinion.
- They're gonna let him go.
- He was the last man to see her.
No-one's denying that, either.
But he wasn't the last person to see her alive.
The last person to see her alive was his own bloody wife.
- And she's a bloody liar!
- Convince me.
Look, it's not our problem, and you know what I mean.
We pass all this over to the CPS.
We let them deal with it.
We haven't got a case!
No forensic, nothing!
Nothing to link him with the crime.
- They're gonna let the bastard go!
- Cool it.
- What?
- I said, cool it.
Who do you think you are, eh?
Who are you trying to impress?
- I'm just asking you to cool it.
- Are you trying to impress Lady Jane here?
- I'm just asking you to cool it.
That's all.
- You're a DC, right?
You're not a DI now.
You're a DC, and I'm a DS, so don't even try.
Don't even try to score points off me.
Right?
Right.
WISE:
We'll think of something.
- You'll let that man go!
- What?
- Nothing.
- We're letting David Harvey go.
OK?
- (Groans)
He's not the first man to get off scot-free, Jimmy.
- Do you want him punished?
- You bloody hypocrite!
Do you want him punished?
He's guilty, so you must.
- For God's sake, let her go.
- Just piss off, Jimmy!
I just want to hear whether or not you want him punished.
(Scouse accent) 'Ey!
Calm down!
- Stay out of this.
- What is wrong with you?
He's guilty, right?
And I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I just want to hear you say yes or bloody no.
- Aye-aye?
- I just want her to answer the question!
What the hell do you think you are?
Jeremy bloody Paxman?
When I was a kid, it was all in Latin.
I used to think the priest was saying, "I bet I can beat you at dominoes."
When the plate came round, I thought they were collecting the bets.
- Why are you still pursuing him?
- I'm pursuing the truth.
People who spout about the truth are usually the biggest liars in the world.
Does it bother you that he got away with murder?
He'll remember that night for as long as he lives.
He's lost his wife because of it.
Hls kids have lost their mother because of lt.
How has he got away with it?
You'll see yourselves out.
- I'm gonna make my mother a millionaire.
- At the casino?
- Bang on.
- You promised you wouldn't gamble again.
This doesn't count.
- Cheap sentimentality!
- I'll explain later.
Cheap sentimentality!
(Tyres squealing)
- Mr Harvey?
- Yeah.
- You're under arrest.
- What for?
- Get in the car.
- What for?
- Get in the car!
- Jesus!
Get in!
I'll tell you why I joined the police force, Mr Harvey.
When I was a kid, there was a copper who used to walked up and down our street.
That was when coppers could walk up and down our street.
He was a big man.
If you kept your nose clean, you'd be all right.
If you stepped out of line, you got a clip round the ear.
Everyone respected him.
I wanted to be like that man.
But I cart be like that man.
They've all gone.
Those days are all gone.
Nowadays, if you give someone a clip round the ear, you end up in court.
I know men who've been killed.
- Let me out of this car.
- I know men who've been killed.
Good men.
Better men than me.
Better coppers than me.
Their killers are still living.
Oh, they're banged up, yeah, but they're still living.
They're treated like bloody heroes, because they killed a copper.
Well, I believe in atonement, Mr Harvey.
If you're guilty, you should atone.
And we're both guilty, Mr Harvey.
I'm with the suspect, David Harvey.
I'm taking him to the roof of the Ramada Hotel.
We're gonna jump off together.
Over.
Jimmy, what the hell are you playing at?
Jlmmy, what the bloody hell are you playing at?
Over.
You're not fit to lick Bilborough's boots, never mind fill them, you scruffy Scouse bastard!
I want an ARV at the hotel.
If he looks like jumping, shoot the bastard.
He's threatening to jump and take David Harvey with him.
Over.
Victor Oscar One to control.
We're just round the corner.
I'm on my way.
Over.
(Siren)
(Tyres screech)
- Get out of the car, Mr Harvey.
- No.
Get out of the car!
Get out, before I blow your bloody brains out.
No!
I've got four children!
I've got four children waiting at home for me!
You owe me nothing, but think of my kids!
Get out!
Police.
Get out.
Go on.
Will you help me, please?
Help me!
For God's sake, do something!
He's gonna kill me!
He's gonna kill me!
He's gonna kill me!
I'm gonna take you right to the top, Mr Harvey, and if you don't confess, I'm gonna push you off.
Does that make you feel like confessing, Mr Harvey?
Did you kill Jean McIlvanney?
Trouble is, it's confession under duress.
Inadmissible.
The judge'll throw it out.
That's the way it is these days.
Everything is designed to get you off.
There's... there's a wonderful...
Oh, what's the word I'm looking for?
Irony.
There's a wonderful irony, isn't there, Mr Harvey?
Because everything is designed to get you off, you're the one who's going to have to die.
Do you appreciate that irony, Mr Harvey?
Aaaarghh!
(Sirens)
(Police radio chatter)
This is evidence.
This is a dying mars statement.
FITZ:
Come on.
PENHALIGON:
Find the passenger lift, Fitz.
Jimmy!
(Grunting)
(Groans)
The suspect Mr Harvey has just confessed to the murder of Jean McIlvanney.
Isn't that right, Mr Harvey?
Mr Harvey has just nodded his head.
(Bell)
Come on.
Come on!
Come fly with me
Let's fly, let's fly away!
(Panting)
- You want me to jump?
- No!
This is evidence.
This is a dying mars statement.
I raped you.
I'm so sorry.
- Jane...
- (Whimpering)
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
(Sobbing)
(Wailing)
A SINGLE GIRL
What are you doing, leaving?
I've been here for hours!
I got stuck in a subway tunnel for at least an hour.
I was leaving.
- Where are you?
- At the bar.
My feet are tired, I want to sit down.
Let's sit over there.
Don't tell me you're gonna sulk.
Okay, okay.
Want to drink something?
- A coffee.
- Won't it make you hyper?
- Is that a dig?
- Yeah, it's a dig.
You're wearing that sweater?
I thought you hated it.
- I never said that.
- You did.
You forgot.
Okay, so what's up?
Nothing.
I'll order the coffees before we fight.
Two coffees, please.
Wait a minute.
Aren't you overdoing it a bit?
Wiggling your butt like that!
Are you nuts?
You don't see the way guys look at you!
What are you, jealous?
Jealous, no.
But you're really flaunting it.
How do you want me to walk?
You're fine.
The hotel guests will get off on it.
You're upset because your team lost so you're gonna sulk for days?
So, what's the news?
Not now.
You're too touchy.
You'll take it badly.
Oh yeah?
So when will you tell me?
Later.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Meantime I'll play some pinball, okay?
You're mean.
I'm mean?
You're a pain!
I am too, but you're the pits!
I know what it is.
Oh yeah?
What?
Sorry.
It's not for me to say.
Downstairs.
Mom?
No, I'm not there yet.
Yes, I told him.
What do you expect him to say?
Don't yell at me.
We haven't discussed it.
I'll call you back.
I'll phone you later.
I went to the john.
Valérie, make up your mind or I'm going.
I'm not telling you now.
You'll take it badly.
You're unbelievable!
Promise...?
I promise nothing.
20 francs!
What a rip-off.
And the coffee's disgusting.
I give you three minutes.
Never mind.
Some other time.
- Three minutes, max.
- What if I need more time?
- I'll walk out.
- That's blackmail.
2 minutes 45.
I'm pregnant.
You finally said it.
Did you know?
- I was pretty sure.
- Liar.
What else could it be?
That I'm leaving you?
You wouldn't do it like that.
How would I do it?
Not like that.
What are you gonna do?
Nothing.
- You want to keep it?
- Yes.
Is that all you can say?
- Are you touched?
- I don't know.
- When did you find out?
- Two days ago.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
How far gone are you?
Four weeks.
So we have time to think.
It's not a matter of time.
- You don't want me to keep it.
- I didn't say that.
You don't want it.
I don't know!
Why do you want it?
Because I do.
- Even on your own?
- Yes.
Shit, you never told me you wanted a baby.
- Did you or didn't you?
- I don't know.
You don't know.
If I hadn't wanted one, I'd have made sure.
Oh yeah?
I've got to go.
- Will you tell them?
- You're kidding.
Okay, you gotta go.
When can we meet again?
I don't...
Friday evening.
Friday evening!
Why not in two weeks or six months.
I'll phone you.
Sure.
Why can't I phone you at your mom's?
I'll come see you at work.
No.
You can't.
What do you suggest?
I'll pop out later.
Wait here.
Be here by 7:30 or I'll come after you.
Do that, get me fired!
You don't work.
You do shit-all.
- Is it my fault?
- Other people find jobs.
It took you a year.
Nine months.
You've got an hour...
What will we say then?
I don't know.
We'll improvise, shit!
Have you got 5 francs?
- I only have a hundred.
- It's okay.
- Just five or six?
- It's on me.
Lady bountiful, huh?
I'm only paying for two coffees.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Is something wrong?
- Sorry.
I'm talking bullshit.
- You're taking it badly.
Taking it badly?
Shit!
We're having a baby.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing.
Can't they sit any closer?
We could have a conversation.
I've got to go.
Don't go yet.
Let's sit over there.
Can you get me some water?
Thanks.
I look a mess.
You're okay.
I look like death.
I can't go like this.
My parents will flip when I tell them.
- Can't you wait a while?
- Why can't I tell them?
First you don't want it, now you run to tell them.
I didn't say I don't want it.
It would be better in a year or two, when we're set up.
Now we have nothing.
You see us all living with my folks?
People manage.
The hell they do.
Maybe you're not so sure you want it.
Go ahead, tell them.
I don't care.
Once I tell them, I can't tell them the opposite two weeks later.
I'll do what I want.
Rémi?
Meet me here in an hour?
Will you wait for me here?
What's the point if we're only gonna fight?
I'll leave you some cigarettes.
You really...
You really blew me away.
What should I have said?
- You're tough.
- Says you.
You are.
Women are stronger than men.
You'd believe anything.
- My mom's tougher than my dad.
- Yeah, but your dad's a twat.
Your mother isn't?
No way!
She's a pain but she's not a twat.
Says you.
She hates my guts.
At least my dad accepts you.
Sure.
He ogles my ass.
My dad ogles your ass?
And it makes you laugh.
So, are you gonna wait here or walk me there?
I'll wait.
See you at 7:30.
What if you can't get out?
I'll find a way.
You're staying here, right?
No, I'll go pick up the helmet from Luc's.
Didn't I tell you?
They found the bike.
Great.
Yeah.
What did he say...?
It was in a garage in Gentilly.
They were trying to sell it.
The only thing missing was the helmet.
You must be happy.
See you later.
Excuse me, where's the locker room?
Down there on the left.
Who put this here?
Hello, I start work today.
- Have you checked the schedule?
- No.
Take the 2nd floor.
- You know what to do?
- More or less.
I'll give you your beeper.
Room service, good morning.
Continental breakfast with coffee room 212.
Five minutes.
212, that's you.
You know how this works?
Have you got your passkey?
Here.
Is Mr. Sarre here?
He's probably upstairs.
- What's your name?
- Valérie Sergent.
Do you want a coffee?
Help yourself.
Take a cup, there.
Miss Sergent, did Mr. Tranh assign you a floor?
Yes, the 2nd.
The 2nd?
You gave Miss Sergent the 2nd floor?
That's Marie-Lise's floor.
She's off today.
My mistake.
You need to sign your contract.
I'll take you there later.
'Morning, Mr. Sarre.
How's it going?
Hello.
Remember me?
- Yes, from last Friday.
- You had me worried!
You're starting today?
Welcome aboard.
- What's your order?
- Two continentals with coffee.
Don't forget the juice.
Sabine, go with Miss Sergent for her first order.
I have a 3rd floor order for a quarter-to.
Go with Miss Sergent.
They can wait.
- What's your order?
- Coffee continental for two.
Where's your down-up?
Your down-up.
Your order.
Have you been here long?
Two years.
What's it like?
It's okay.
Do I go in with you?
Do I or not?
Of course.
I'm not here to keep you company.
Room service, good morning.
Can you open the curtains please?
Could you sign here?
Doesn't make much difference.
- May I check your minibar?
- Go ahead.
Come and see.
One glance, see what's gone.
Two waters, two whiskies, two tonics, two Cokes...
Miss!
I drank a whisky.
See?
There's one missing.
You get an eye for it.
Do you need anything else, sir?
No, thanks.
- Are you asleep or what?
- I'm not asleep.
You don't say.
My name's Fatiah.
- What's yours?
- Valérie.
Is it your first day?
- Not too lost?
- I'm okay.
Miss Sergent, the guest in 239 wants his breakfast.
- What is it?
- It's on the board.
It was for 6:40, Mr. Faivre.
No more milk?
No more milk.
- There's one carton left.
- Where?
In front of you.
That's one too many.
It's for one!
- Have you done this before?
- At the Sheraton.
Really?
When?
Last year.
I was there too, last year!
- I quit in March.
- Amazing!
I started in April.
You know Béatrice Frechet?
And her husband?
He's too much.
- You know Philippe?
- Naturally.
And that girl, what's her name?
The traveller, ex-hippy...
- Dominique.
- That's it, Dominique.
Why did you quit?
I was sick of it.
I quit because I was on nights.
I never saw my little boy.
Have you got kids?
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I didn't touch it.
Miss!
- Shouldn't I sign something?
- Oh, yes.
Lousy weather again.
It's not very nice.
- Is Paris always like this?
- Often.
Really?
I don't know how you stand it.
Force of habit.
Habit?
That's fine by me, but there's a limit.
Do you need anything else?
I don't think so.
Oh, yes.
Have you a map of Paris?
No, but I can have one sent up or you can call reception.
Buttes Chaumont.
Is it far?
Yes, but I can't tell you the way.
My son lives there.
He asked me to lunch because his wife is away.
In secret!
Ridiculous.
Like lovers, with my son.
Why am I telling you this?
Goodbye, sir.
Going UP?
- Did you finish?
- Yes, I'm done.
Is it good?
- I gave up.
Eric does it.
- On his own'?
I help him out.
Bizarre.
Room service!
Not very funny, I agree but if we can't kid around...
Am I bothering you?
...we may as well jump out the window.
You have a sad smile.
You do, honest.
Nobody's ever told you?
I'm surprised.
Mind you, people say I've a happy smile but actually I'm desperate.
I wanted to be a singer.
I write songs.
- But I know I never will.
- Why not?
I'm no good.
Is anybody good?
Some are not bad.
You're a harsh critic.
Souchon, Capdevielle, Johnny Hallyday...
Do you know Capdevielle?
"When you've been in the desert For too long..."
Ring a bell?
You're too young.
Enough chit-chat.
It's wakeup time.
Duty calls.
Jean-Marc!
Boiled eggs for 106.
Tell the kitchen.
- Anything for me?
- Two, but Mr. Sarre is looking for you.
- He knows where I am.
- It's about your contract.
Sabine, take 241 and 238.
It's not my floor.
She has to sign her contract.
Terrific!
On top of my own work..
Do 238 at least.
They have a plane to catch.
- Don't look at me like that!
- I'm not.
Come with me.
You'll be back in ten minutes.
Are you settling in okay?
Yes, thanks.
Have you had a tour of the hotel?
You showed me around yourself.
So I did.
Strange.
I phoned her 15 minutes ago.
Do we wait?
We'll wait a bit.
She may have just popped out.
Here she is.
Do come in.
Mrs. Charles, this is Miss Sergent.
She started today, as I told you.
Good.
Why did you leave the Sheraton?
It's rather complicated.
I had a quarrel with a supervisor.
I chose to quit.
A quarrel about what?
Nothing important.
He was always after us.
You left without pay?
About a year ago.
He was always after you?
Yes.
How have you lived since then?
I live with my mother.
I see.
So you're looking for a steady job.
It isn't easy here, either.
You'll have to grin and bear it sometimes.
I'm sure.
Do you feel up to it?
We'll take you on trial to start with, for one month.
After that, we'll see how you fit in.
Right.
Are you on unemployment?
So you'd be sorry not to be taken on permanently?
I'll leave you together.
Thank you.
You live far away.
It's fast by train.
Is it?
What does your mother do?
- Secretary.
- You chose hotel work.
You're not married.
Boyfriend?
What does he do?
He works.
I'm sure.
Although he could be unemployed.
What is his line?
Cars.
Mechanic?
No, he's in sales.
You must think I'm nosy.
I went through this last Friday.
You already had an interview?
Not with me.
We like to double-check.
And there was the Sheraton incident.
There was no incident.
- I heard there was.
- Did you call them?
Surprised?
A little.
I can't take him, I'm in a meeting.
Have him call me later.
Put him through.
I can't talk, I'm in a meeting.
I said I'm in a meeting.
That's completely untrue.
We'll discuss it later.
Régis is skiing with his class.
Eight thousand.
Now sign these.
- You can read them.
- It's okay.
You'll be paid 7,800 francs a month.
Just under 7,000 net.
Fine.
Plus tips.
Keep this one.
You're pretty.
It's a compliment but also a warning, you understand?
I'm not sure.
- I don't want any trouble.
- Why should there be?
It's unfortunate that you're so pretty.
We have a lot of single male guests who try their luck.
I'm used to it.
I'm sure.
That's the problem.
They offer money.
A lot.
I'm not into that.
How was it at the Sheraton?
I told you!
- I didn't...
- This is crazy.
Goodbye, Miss Sergent!
- What's up?
- Nothing.
- You look strange.
- I signed my contract.
It had an effect on you!
I already served four breakfasts for you!
Thanks.
What are you doing?
That's too much.
Did you do 203?
- I'm doing it.
- They're waiting.
- Where's the order?
- There.
Full breakfast, tea with cold milk, yogurt, the Figaro...
- Where are the cornflakes?
- Up there.
Razor blades, sir?
Certainly.
These shoes are killing me!
I can't lend you mine.
Room service, good morning.
Could you sign, please?
Room 219.
One champagne split, one mineral water.
Mom, it's me.
I can't talk long.
It's going okay.
I can't discuss it now.
You don't understand!
I don't care.
Sorry.
Mom?
Talk to me.
I was calling the cashier.
Good.
Why're you here?
I was called on my beeper.
- Am I disturbing you?
- I've finished.
Can I get W?
No more phone calls?
- Little slut.
- Cut it out!
Stay away from me!
- You'll tell mom?
- I'll slug you.
- Scared I'll rape you?
- I warn you.
If I report your phone calls
- it'll look bad on your first day.
- You filthy...
Filthy what?
Filthy slob.
- We'll settle this later.
- Yeah, right.
I could use a smoke.
Scrambled eggs in 5 minutes!
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.
Was there a bomb scare?
Did nobody tell us?
You okay?
I have to run out for something.
- For something?
- Drop off some keys.
Leave them with the concierge.
I need scrambled eggs.
The woman in 106 has guts.
She come out stark naked, told me to put the tray on her.
I've had that happen.
A woman asked me to "spend some time" with her.
Her tits, wow!
Nice tits?
Superb!
And the rest of her!
I saw her pussy.
- Don't embarrass the ladies.
- Embarrass?
- She wasn't embarrassed about it.
- Don't get excited.
It takes more than that.
Go for it.
Suite 275.
Breakfast with coffee for two.
Yes, sir.
Don't get any ideas, flunky.
Who's talking?
You like it doggy-style?
Let me get my coffee.
The girl's in heat.
Take a cart, it's a suite.
Don't worry, he gets these fits.
He's not a bad guy.
He's like that.
I'll leave it here.
She should bring it to the bed.
Come closer, we won't eat you.
Is that the 90-franc breakfast?
No eggs?
I don't like eggs for breakfast.
For 90 francs we should get eggs.
It's 60 francs, ma'am.
Even for 60.
You'd like some eggs?
Yes.
In hotels I like the whole shebang.
- You're not going to eat eggs.
- You bet I am.
Would you like them fried, boiled, scrambled?
Fried.
Not too hard, not too runny.
Fine.
Sign here, please.
- And they make us sign!
- I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'll get your eggs.
I need two fried eggs, now.
Got a smoke?
Mine are in my locker.
I don't smoke.
Mr. Tranh does, though.
- I don't like to ask him.
- Shall I?
- Where can I smoke?
- Back there.
Okay?
Yes, okay.
Everyone keeps asking me.
I heard about your fight.
You sure told off Jean-Marc!
I didn't.
- You didn't?
Patrice says you did.
- Patrice talks too much.
Can I have a drag?
Patrice really digs you.
Fatiah, I want to smoke in peace, okay?
He's a pig but women like him.
The fried eggs are here.
- Did it go okay?
- Fine.
Mrs. Charles is a nice lady.
- What are you doing?
- Checking the towels.
Checking the towels?
I rinsed my hands.
I hope you didn't puke.
- I'm sure you puked in the john!
- Are you crazy?
Jean, call someone!
The maid puked in the bathroom.
You're nuts!
I didn't puke, I rinsed my hands.
Please, I'd like to go.
That's enough.
Let me by.
You're staying here.
What's up?
She threw up in our bathroom.
I checked the towels.
Why are you naked?
Don't yell at me!
Get dressed.
You, get out.
She's nuts.
Mom?
I had to hang up.
A guy came in.
A waiter.
I've forgotten what I had to say.
I don't know.
I'll call you back if I remember.
It wasn't important.
I can't remember!
I don't think so, or I'd remember.
I knew you'd say that.
Talk to you later.
- You scared me.
- I was looking for you.
I felt dizzy.
I had to lie down.
Feeling better?
Are you pregnant?
- You should have said.
- I'm okay, honest.
I'm sorry about before.
I was a little mean.
Because of Jean-Marc.
I saw him looking at you.
I'm jealous.
Not nice, huh?
Everybody...
When is it due?
Not for ages.
Did they miss me in the pantry?
I've been gone a long time.
They'll wait.
What are you doing for lunch?
Nothing.
Can we eat together?
- I don't eat lunch.
- A sandwich?
No way.
This work makes me sick of food.
I can't eat a thing.
We could just have a chat.
I'm going shopping with my sister.
- Want to come?
- I'd love to.
I like shopping.
Where are you going?
- Printemps.
- I prefer Galeries Lafayette.
I have no preference.
Nothing.
Say it.
Don't get shat on.
I'm not getting shat on.
- Don't get screwed.
- Did you?
You have a kid?
You don't know what it's like.
I got screwed.
You're getting screwed.
What are you getting at?
The guy.
The baby didn't make itself.
No...
I don't know.
What are you, a saint?
You're happy.
It shows.
I don't understand.
Understand what?
Unhappiness?
It's simple.
I'll explain.
You're sitting happily up on a cloud and...
You'll understand, I promise.
I hear some guests gave you trouble.
It wasn't serious.
We get oddballs.
- They were weird.
- Hyped up.
It's no joke sometimes.
Miss Sergent.
I had a complaint from room 275.
- It's been dealt with.
- Dealt with?
- With Mr. Sarre.
- Good.
Is it heavy?
Where were you?
Taking a piss.
- Hey, nice outfit!
- Let's sit there.
I'm getting tired of being here.
It's good to sit down.
How's it going?
Okay.
It's work.
- So it's cool.
- It's not cool at all.
I have worries.
It's a drag.
As soon as one worry disappears,
I get another one.
Don't you ever worry?
Like everybody, I guess.
- Not like me.
- You don't show it.
I know but it screws me up.
My mother's a pain but I can't help phoning her.
I'm holding back.
I want to phone her now.
Work has a weird effect on you.
You can say that again.
Work doesn't affect you?
I walk in on men crying, couples fucking and I stand there, saying
- "Would you like orange juice?"
- Did you say "fucking"?
Watch your mouth!
Sex is all they talk about.
Sounds interesting.
It doesn't turn me on.
You might like it.
Boys often do.
Your colleagues, maybe.
Not me.
I've been doing some thinking.
What about?
What the hell do you think?
Us.
Is that all?
Are you drunk or something?
You're all worked up.
I'm sick of being serious the whole damn time!
- God, you're a pain.
- You wanna talk?
Go on, then!
I'm listening.
You trying to be funny?
I'm just fed up.
- Fed up with what?
- Thinking.
- Nothing for me.
- Nor me.
I was at the bar.
You can't sit here without ordering.
- We're leaving, anyway.
- No, we're staying.
Give me another coffee.
Nothing for me, get it?
You don't get it.
You can't sit here and not order.
A glass of water with a straw, please.
You should go.
If you're fired you'll blame me.
I won't.
It was my idea to come.
Have you told your parents?
Did you tell Luc?
- We talked about it.
- Did you have to?
At least I told you that I told him!
- What did Luc say'?
- Nothing.
- You admire him.
- What are you saying?
- Don't deny it.
- Okay, you win.
Don't you admire anybody?
- You admire yourself.
- I do not.
- You think you're pretty.
- Not really.
Come off it.
I think my body's okay.
And your face?
Don't you think it's pretty?
I think it's pretty.
- Luc is sometimes right.
- I hate men who are always right.
You hate him so much?
Some girls go for it.
He's got it together.
Sure!
He can really chow down as long as he's not paying.
He never gets screwed.
Is it good to get screwed?
No, but I feel like everybody's screwing me.
Anyway, he's always right.
And it costs him nothing.
He's broke.
- It suits him fine.
- Don't get angry.
I hate wiseguys who bum off you and despise you for buying a subway pass.
Stop it.
He always talks about being ripped off by society.
Society doesn't get rich from subway crooks like him.
What are you preaching?
Nothing.
I'm going.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Cry, it'll do you good.
Thanks.
You're crazy to thank me.
Do you want a drink?
I don't know.
A shot of scotch?
I'll get it.
Stay there.
I thought I'd had it.
Was it intuition?
Yeah, I know you.
You sure do.
What's "boom"?
Want some?
How can we not split up?
Start by not thinking about it.
It isn't easy.
Don't you ever think about it?
Why do other people split up?
They fall out of love.
Go if you like.
We can't stay here all morning.
I'm going to work.
That's not what I meant.
Sorry.
I'd better go.
- Wait till you feel better.
- I'm better.
I'll get a job, okay?
But I warn you, a lot of things piss me off.
You're telling me.
We'll have to put up with working from now on.
Feeling better?
Ready to g0?
I'll get the bill.
- I don't want to go.
- Don't go, then.
- We can't go on loving.
- Oh yeah?
Because one day we won't love each other, so we'd better stop now?
Are you 90mg?
I'm out of here.
I've listened to enough bullshit!
Are you coming?
- You're staying here all morning?
- If I want.
You want another argument?
Is that what you want?
You know we'll split.
No, I don't know it.
Everybody splits up.
Everyone's abandoned.
I won't abandon you.
My mother was abandoned, and me, and Sabine.
- I'll never be with anybody.
- Don't say that.
Don't you believe me?
There's the baby.
It's not being with somebody.
Got a name?
Stanislas.
- What if it's a girl?
- It'll be a boy.
You'd rather?
Who is Sabine?
A girl at the hotel.
She fucks a creep who tried to corner me.
Sounds like quite a place.
They fuck because they feel abandoned.
- It's not only that.
- It is.
I need to make up a story.
They must have noticed.
What will you say?
The truth.
I'm pregnant, we're breaking up and it takes time.
- You can't say that.
- I will.
Fabien!
You're all muddy?
Where's mommy?
Oh, there she is!
Has he been good?
Have you been here long?
Since 4:30.
We came straight from daycare.
What did they say?
Not much.
I saw that girl, Isabelle.
And?
Nothing special.
She says he never cries.
It's true, he never does.
He cries with me, a little.
You never cried.
I must have cried sometimes.
- Want me to cry now?
- Thanks, I'll pass.
What?
What's this called?
A pebble.
She's making fun of you.
Go and play.
Off you go!
You're pale.
I'm a bit tired.
You shouldn't be tired at your age.
I don't sleep well.
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes.
- Don't say that.
It's not true.
- I'm not sick.
- How is work?
- Okay.
- Are you fed up'?
- No, it's okay.
- I'm cold.
Aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
Mr. Vasseur is coming to Paris.
Can you get a discount on a room?
I don't know.
I'll ask.
- They must do discounts.
- It will still be pricey.
- He has a very good job.
- So why ask for a discount?
As a favor.
I'll repay you the 2,000 next week.
I didn't get to the bank.
Plus the rompers, that's 2,400.
Don't pay me back for the rompers.
Thanks, mom.
So you're going to marry Mr. Vasseur?
Yes, and have lots of children.
- Tell me!
- I told you.
You don't want to tell me.
- I barely know him.
- He's coming to see you.
He's coming for the trade fair, too.
Have you slept with him?
Can't I have any privacy?
Go on, mom.
Tell.
I don't know...
I can't make up my mind.
In a way, I'd like to end my life with somebody, but then again...
The thought of this man in my bed every night...
Not necessarily every night.
So he's very...
I see!
So you have slept with him!
- Aren't I allowed to?
- Sure.
- Do you ever think...
- About Mr. Vasseur?
- About starting over with somebody.
- I think about it.
I think I've found him.
- Known him long?
- Not very.
But you love him?
Not much.
I can't see you living with a man you don't love.
- You can't?
- Not at all!
Well, it's not true.
- Not true?
- No.
That's a pity.
That I don't have a Mr. Vasseur?
Don't be silly!
Let's go.
We're going home.
Aren't you coming?
- Does he ever see his dad?
- He saw him at Christmas.
Now you're sorry.
Things don't always go the way we'd like.
I don't know about that.
What's Mr. Vasseur's first name?
Does he have one?
Pierre.
Okay, so call him Pierre.
- Your father was a Pierre, too.
- I know.
You do?
Get real, mom!
He was my dad, wasn't he?
He was.
- If not, we'll change the story.
- It's the true story.
Any story will do, I suppose.
Are you sorry?
Oh, yes.
I'm not afraid to say so.
I behaved like an idiot with him.
You can't imagine.
I was selfish, arrogant, the whole works.
I was awful to him.
I didn't realize.
It seemed, I don't know... normal.
- You said you didn't love him.
- I thought I didn't.
Now you're saying you did?
In my way.
My way of loving nobody.
The way I saw it then, love was a fairy tale.
If they liked me, that was enough.
- I got my punishment.
- Your punishment?
Yes, I got my punishment.
Not that I'm unhappy.
I've got you and Fabien.
- But as for my life...
- What's Pierre like?
Is he tall, short...?
He's tall, tall.
Is that all?
You don't care.
No, I don't care.
Don't you love him?
Mr. Vasseur will be happy with a pretty little wife.
Come off it!
You still look great for your age.
But you should change your hair, it's gross.
That's better.
Why do you buy blouses like that?
It's so ugly!
It's comfy.
What's up?
What are you looking at?
Oh, no!
You're thinking he'd make me a good little husband.
You're out of your mind!
I don't want one.
I'm sad you're alone.
Knock it off.
I don't want to discuss it.
- Can't I help?
- Stop bugging me!
I'm not unhappy.
What good would it do me to live with some nerd?
Come on, little man.
I'm going to call in sick.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
We picked the worst subject to talk about.
Take him.
I'll take the stroller.
Come here, my boy.
Quick, the train's coming.
Hold the gate for me.
We've got time.
We're gonna miss it.
So hurry UP!
Here, take him.
Say goodbye.
- I'll call you tonight.
- Call me, okay?
Bye-bye, darling.
Bye!
I'll call you.
What are you doing, leaving?
I've been here for hours!
I got stuck in a subway tunnel for at least an hour.
I was leaving.
- Where are you?
- At the bar.
My feet are tired, I want to sit down.
Let's sit over there.
Don't tell me you're gonna sulk.
Okay, okay.
Want to drink something?
- A coffee.
- Won't it make you hyper?
- Is that a dig?
- Yeah, it's a dig.
You're wearing that sweater?
I thought you hated it.
- I never said that.
- You did.
You forgot.
Okay, so what's up?
Nothing.
I'll order the coffees before we fight.
Two coffees, please.
Wait a minute.
Aren't you overdoing it a bit?
Wiggling your butt like that!
Are you nuts?
You don't see the way guys look at you!
What are you, jealous?
Jealous, no.
But you're really flaunting it.
How do you want me to walk?
You're fine.
The hotel guests will get off on it.
You're upset because your team lost so you're gonna sulk for days?
So, what's the news?
Not now.
You're too touchy.
You'll take it badly.
Oh yeah?
So when will you tell me?
Later.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Meantime I'll play some pinball, okay?
You're mean.
I'm mean?
You're a pain!
I am too, but you're the pits!
I know what it is.
Oh yeah?
What?
Sorry.
It's not for me to say.
Downstairs.
Mom?
No, I'm not there yet.
Yes, I told him.
What do you expect him to say?
Don't yell at me.
We haven't discussed it.
I'll call you back.
I'll phone you later.
I went to the john.
Valérie, make up your mind or I'm going.
I'm not telling you now.
You'll take it badly.
You're unbelievable!
Promise...?
I promise nothing.
20 francs!
What a rip-off.
And the coffee's disgusting.
I give you 3 minutes.
Never mind.
Some other time.
- Three minutes, max.
- What if I need more time?
- I'll walk out.
- That's blackmail.
2 minutes 45.
I'm pregnant.
You finally said it.
Did you know?
- I was pretty sure.
- Liar.
What else could it be?
That I'm leaving you?
You wouldn't do it like that.
How would I do it?
Not like that.
What are you gonna do?
Nothing.
- You want to keep it?
- Yes.
Is that all you can say?
- Are you touched?
- I don't know.
- When did you find out?
- Two days ago.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
How far gone are you?
Four weeks.
So we have time to think.
It's not a matter of time.
- You don't want me to keep it.
- I didn't say that.
You don't want it.
I don't know!
Why do you want it?
Because I do.
- Even on your own?
- Yes.
Shit, you never told me you wanted a baby.
- Did you or didn't you?
- I don't know.
You don't know.
If I hadn't wanted one, I'd have made sure.
Oh yeah?
I've got to go.
- Will you tell them?
- You're kidding.
Okay, you gotta go.
When can we meet again?
I don't...
Friday evening.
Friday evening!
Why not in two weeks or six months.
I'll phone you.
Sure.
Why can't I phone you at your mom's?
I'll come see you at work.
No.
You can't.
What do you suggest?
I'll pop out later.
Wait here.
Be here by 7:30 or I'll come after you.
Do that, get me fired!
You don't work.
You do shit-all.
- Is it my fault?
- Other people find jobs.
It took you a year.
Nine months.
You've got an hour...
What will we say then?
I don't know.
We'll improvise, shit!
Have you got 5 francs?
- I only have a hundred.
- It's okay.
- Just five or six?
- It's on me.
Lady bountiful, huh?
I'm only paying for two coffees.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Is something wrong?
- Sorry.
I'm talking bullshit.
- You're taking it badly.
Taking it badly?
Shit!
We're having a baby.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing.
Can't they sit any closer?
We could have a conversation.
I've got to go.
Don't go yet.
Let's sit over there.
Can you get me some water?
Thanks.
I look a mess.
You're okay.
I look like death.
I can't go like this.
My parents will flip when I tell them.
- Can't you wait a while?
- Why can't I tell them?
First you don't want it, now you run to tell them.
I didn't say I don't want it.
It would be better in a year or two, when we're set up.
Now we have nothing.
You see us all living with my folks?
People manage.
The hell they do.
Maybe you're not so sure you want it.
Go ahead, tell them.
I don't care.
Once I tell them, I can't tell them the opposite two weeks later.
I'll do what I want.
Rémi?
Meet me here in an hour?
Will you wait for me here?
What's the point if we're only gonna fight?
I'll leave you some cigarettes.
You really...
You really blew me away.
What should I have said?
- You're tough.
- Says you.
You are.
Women are stronger than men.
You'd believe anything.
- My mom's tougher than my dad.
- Yeah, but your dad's a twat.
Your mother isn't?
No way!
She's a pain but she's not a twat.
Says you.
She hates my guts.
At least my dad accepts you.
Sure.
He ogles my ass.
My dad ogles your ass?
And it makes you laugh.
So, are you gonna wait here or walk me there?
I'll wait.
See you at 7:30.
What if you can't get out?
I'll find a way.
You're staying here, right?
No, I'll go pick up the helmet from Luc's.
Didn't I tell you?
They found the bike.
Great.
Yeah.
What did he say...?
It was in a garage in Gentilly.
They were trying to sell it.
The only thing missing was the helmet.
You must be happy.
See you later.
Where's the locker room?
Down there on the left.
Who put this here?
I start work today.
- Have you checked the schedule?
- No.
Take the 2nd floor.
- You know what to do?
- More or less.
I'll give you your beeper.
Room service, good morning.
Continental breakfast with coffee room 212.
Five minutes.
212, that's you.
You know how this works?
Have you got your passkey?
Here.
Is Mr. Sarre here?
He's probably upstairs.
- What's your name?
- Valérie Sergent.
Do you want a coffee?
Help yourself.
Take a cup, there.
Miss Sergent, did Mr. Tranh assign you a floor?
Yes, the 2nd.
The 2nd?
You gave Miss Sergent the 2nd floor?
That's Marie-Lise's floor.
She's off today.
My mistake.
You need to sign your contract.
I'll take you there later.
'Morning, Mr. Sarre.
How's it going?
Hello.
Remember me?
- Yes, from last Friday.
- You had me worried!
You're starting today?
Welcome aboard.
- What's your order?
- Two continentals with coffee.
Don't forget the juice.
Sabine, go with Miss Sergent for her first order.
I have a 3rd floor order for a quarter-to.
Go with Miss Sergent.
They can wait.
- What's your order?
- Coffee continental for two.
Where's your down-up?
Your down-up.
Your order.
Have you been here long?
Two years.
What's it like?
It's okay.
Do I go in with you?
Do I or not?
Of course.
I'm not here to keep you company.
Room service, good morning.
Can you open the curtains please?
Could you sign here?
Doesn't make much difference.
- May I check your minibar?
- Go ahead.
Come and see.
One glance, see what's gone.
Two waters, two whiskies, two tonics, two Cokes...
Miss!
I drank a whisky.
See?
There's one missing.
You get an eye for it.
Do you need anything else, sir?
No, thanks.
- Are you asleep or what?
- I'm not asleep.
You don't say.
My name's Fatiah.
- What's yours?
- Valérie.
Is it your first day?
- Not too lost?
- I'm okay.
Miss Sergent, the guest in 239 wants his breakfast.
- What is it?
- It's on the board.
It was for 6:40, Mr. Faivre.
No more milk?
No more milk.
- There's one carton left.
- Where?
In front of you.
That's one too many.
It's for one!
- Have you done this before?
- At the Sheraton.
Really?
When?
Last year.
I was there too, last year!
- I quit in March.
- Amazing!
I started in April.
You know Béatrice Frechet?
And her husband?
He's too much.
- You know Philippe?
- Naturally.
And that girl, what's her name?
The traveller, ex-hippy...
- Dominique.
- That's it, Dominique.
Why did you quit?
I was sick of it.
I quit because I was on nights.
I never saw my little boy.
Have you got kids?
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I didn't touch it.
Miss!
- Shouldn't I sign something?
- Oh, yes.
Lousy weather again.
It's not very nice.
- Is Paris always like this?
- Often.
Really?
I don't know how you stand it.
Force of habit.
Habit?
That's fine by me, but there's a limit.
Do you need anything else?
I don't think so.
Oh, yes.
Have you a map of Paris?
No, but I can have one sent up or you can call reception.
Buttes Chaumont.
Is it far?
Yes, but I can't tell you the way.
My son lives there.
He asked me to lunch because his wife is away.
In secret!
Ridiculous.
Like lovers, with my son.
Why am I telling you this?
Goodbye, sir.
Going up?
- Did you finish?
- Yes, I'm done.
Is it good?
- I gave up.
Eric does it.
- On his own?
I help him out.
Bizarre.
Room service!
Not very funny, I agree but if we can't kid around...
Am I bothering you?
...we may as well jump out the window.
You have a sad smile.
You do, honest.
Nobody's ever told you?
I'm surprised.
Mind you, people say I've a happy smile but actually I'm desperate.
I wanted to be a singer.
I write songs.
- But I know I never will.
- Why not?
I'm no good.
Is anybody good?
Some are not bad.
You're a harsh critic.
Souchon, Capdevielle, Johnny Hallyday...
Do you know Capdevielle?
When you've been in the desert For too long...
Ring a bell?
You're too young.
Enough chit-chat.
It's wakeup time.
Duty calls.
Jean-Marc!
Boiled eggs for 106.
Tell the kitchen.
Anything for me?
- Two, but Mr. Sarre is looking for you.
- He knows where I am.
- It's about your contract.
Sabine, take 241 and 238.
It's not my floor.
She has to sign her contract.
Terrific!
On top of my own work..
Do 238 at least.
They have a plane to catch.
- Don't look at me like that!
- I'm not.
Come with me.
You'll be back in ten minutes.
Are you settling in okay?
Yes, thanks.
Have you had a tour of the hotel?
You showed me around yourself.
So I did.
Strange.
I phoned her 15 minutes ago.
Do we wait?
We'll wait a bit.
She may have just popped out.
Here she is.
Do come in.
Mrs. Charles, this is Miss Sergent.
She started today, as I told you.
Good.
Why did you leave the Sheraton?
It's rather complicated.
I had a quarrel with a supervisor.
I chose to quit.
A quarrel about what?
Nothing important.
He was always after us.
You left without pay?
About a year ago.
He was always after you?
Yes.
How have you lived since then?
I live with my mother.
I see.
So you're looking for a steady job.
It isn't easy here, either.
You'll have to grin and bear it sometimes.
I'm sure.
Do you feel up to it?
We'll take you on trial to start with, for one month.
After that, we'll see how you fit in.
Right.
Are you on unemployment?
So you'd be sorry not to be taken on permanently?
I'll leave you together.
Thank you.
You live far away.
It's fast by train.
Is it?
What does your mother do?
- Secretary.
- You chose hotel work.
You're not married.
Boyfriend?
What does he do?
He works.
I'm sure.
Although he could be unemployed.
What is his line?
Cars.
Mechanic?
No, he's in sales.
You must think I'm nosy.
I went through this last Friday.
You already had an interview?
Not with me.
We like to double-check.
And there was the Sheraton incident.
There was no incident.
- I heard there was.
- Did you call them?
Surprised?
A little.
I can't take him, I'm in a meeting.
Have him call me later.
Put him through.
I can't talk, I'm in a meeting.
I said I'm in a meeting.
That's completely untrue.
We'll discuss it later.
Régis is skiing with his class.
Eight thousand.
Now sign these.
- You can read them.
- It's okay.
You'll be paid 7,800 francs a month.
Just under 7,000 net.
Fine.
Plus tips.
Keep this one.
You're pretty.
It's a compliment but also a warning, you understand?
I'm not sure.
- I don't want any trouble.
- Why should there be?
It's unfortunate that you're so pretty.
We have a lot of single male guests who try their luck.
I'm used to it.
I'm sure.
That's the problem.
They offer money.
A lot.
I'm not into that.
How was it at the Sheraton?
I told you!
- I didn't...
- This is crazy.
Goodbye, Miss Sergent!
- What's up?
- Nothing.
- You look strange.
- I signed my contract.
It had an effect on you!
I already served four breakfasts for you!
Thanks.
What are you doing?
That's too much.
Did you do 203?
- I'm doing it.
- They're waiting.
- Where's the order?
- There.
Full breakfast, tea with cold milk, yogurt, the Figaro...
- Where are the cornflakes?
- Up there.
Razor blades, sir?
Certainly.
These shoes are killing me!
I can't lend you mine.
Room service, good morning.
Could you sign, please?
Room 219.
One champagne split, one mineral water.
Mom, it's me.
I can't talk long.
It's going okay.
I can't discuss it now.
You don't understand!
I don't care.
Sorry.
Mom?
Talk to me.
I was calling the cashier.
Good.
Why're you here?
I was called on my beeper.
- Am I disturbing you?
- I've finished.
Can I get by?
No more phone calls?
- Little slut.
- Cut it out!
Stay away from me!
- You'll tell mom?
- I'll slug you.
- Scared I'll rape you?
- I warn you.
If I report your phone calls
- it'll look bad on your first day.
- You filthy...
Filthy what?
Filthy slob.
- We'll settle this later.
- Yeah, right.
I could use a smoke.
Scrambled eggs in 5 minutes!
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.
Was there a bomb scare?
Did nobody tell us?
You okay?
I have to run out for something.
- For something?
- Drop off some keys.
Leave them with the concierge.
I need scrambled eggs.
The woman in 106 has guts.
She come out stark naked, told me to put the tray on her.
I've had that happen.
A woman asked me to "spend some time" with her.
Her tits, wow!
Nice tits?
Superb!
And the rest of her!
I saw her pussy.
- Don't embarrass the ladies.
- Embarrass?
- She wasn't embarrassed about it.
- Don't get excited.
It takes more than that.
Go for it.
Suite 275.
Breakfast with coffee for two.
Yes, sir.
Don't get any ideas, flunky.
Who's talking?
You like it doggy-fashion?
Let me get my coffee.
The girl's in heat.
Take a cart, it's a suite.
Don't worry, he gets these fits.
He's not a bad guy.
He's like that.
I'll leave it here.
She should bring it to the bed.
Come closer, we won't eat you.
Is that the 90-franc breakfast?
No eggs?
I don't like eggs for breakfast.
For 90 francs we should get eggs.
It's 60 francs, ma'am.
Even for 60.
You'd like some eggs?
Yes.
In hotels I like the whole shebang.
- You're not going to eat eggs.
- You bet I am.
Would you like them fried, boiled, scrambled?
Fried.
Not too hard, not too runny.
Fine.
Sign here, please.
- And they make us sign!
- I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'll get your eggs.
I need two fried eggs, now.
Got a smoke?
Mine are in my locker.
I don't smoke.
Mr. Tranh does, though.
- I don't like to ask him.
- Shall I?
- Where can I smoke?
- Back there.
Okay?
Okay.
Everyone keeps asking me.
I heard about your fight.
You sure told off Jean-Marc!
I didn't.
You didn't?
Patrice says you did.
- Patrice talks too much.
Can I have a drag?
Patrice really digs you.
Fatiah, I want to smoke in peace, okay?
He's a pig but women like him.
The fried eggs are here.
- Did it go okay?
- Fine.
Mrs. Charles is a nice lady.
- What are you doing?
- Checking the towels.
Checking the towels?
I rinsed my hands.
I hope you didn't puke.
I'm sure you puked in the john!
- Are you crazy?
Jean, call someone!
The maid puked in the bathroom.
You're nuts!
I didn't puke, I rinsed my hands.
Please, I'd like to go.
That's enough.
Let me by.
You're staying here.
What's up?
She threw up in our bathroom.
I checked the towels.
Why are you naked?
Don't yell at me!
Get dressed.
You, get out.
She's nuts.
Mom?
I had to hang up.
A guy came in.
A waiter.
I've forgotten what I had to say.
I don't know.
I'll call you back if I remember.
It wasn't important.
I can't remember!
I don't think so, or I'd remember.
I knew you'd say that.
Talk to you later.
- You scared me.
- I was looking for you.
I felt dizzy.
I had to lie down.
Feeling better?
Are you pregnant?
You should have said.
- I'm okay, honest.
I'm sorry about before.
I was a little mean.
Because of Jean-Marc.
I saw him looking at you.
I'm jealous.
Not nice, huh?
Everybody...
When is it due?
Not for ages.
Did they miss me in the pantry?
I've been gone a long time.
They'll wait.
What are you doing for lunch?
Nothing.
Can we eat together?
- I don't eat lunch.
- A sandwich?
No way.
This work makes me sick of food.
I can't eat a thing.
We could just have a chat.
I'm going shopping with my sister.
- Want to come?
- I'd love to.
I like shopping.
Where are you going?
- Printemps.
- I prefer Galeries Lafayette.
I have no preference.
Nothing.
Say it.
Don't get shat on.
I'm not getting shat on.
- Don't get screwed.
- Did you?
You have a kid?
You don't know what it's like.
I got screwed.
You're getting screwed.
What are you getting at?
The guy.
The baby didn't make itself.
No...
I don't know.
What are you, a saint?
You're happy.
It shows.
I don't understand.
Understand what?
Unhappiness?
It's simple.
I'll explain.
You're sitting happily up on a cloud and...
You'll understand, I promise.
I hear some guests gave you trouble.
It wasn't serious.
We get oddballs.
- They were weird.
- Hyped up.
It's no joke sometimes.
Miss Sergent.
I had a complaint from room 276.
- It's been dealt with.
- Dealt with?
- With Mr. Sarre.
- Good.
Is it heavy?
Where were you?
Taking a piss.
- Hey, nice outfit!
- Let's sit there.
I'm getting tired of being here.
It's good to sit down.
How's it going?
Okay.
It's work.
- So it's cool.
- It's not cool at all.
I have worries.
It's a drag.
As soon as one worry disappears,
I get another one.
Don't you ever worry?
Like everybody, I guess.
- Not like me.
- You don't show it.
I know but it screws me up.
My mother's a pain but I can't help phoning her.
I'm holding back.
I want to phone her now.
Work has a weird effect on you.
You can say that again.
Work doesn't affect you?
I walk in on men crying, couples fucking and I stand there, saying
- "Would you like orange juice?"
- Did you say "fucking"?
Watch your mouth!
Sex is all they talk about.
Sounds interesting.
It doesn't turn me on.
You might like it.
Boys often do.
Your colleagues, maybe.
Not me.
I've been doing some thinking.
What about?
What the hell do you think?
Us.
Is that all?
Are you drunk or something?
You're all worked up.
I'm sick of being serious the whole damn time!
God, you're a pain.
- You wanna talk?
Go on, then!
I'm listening.
You trying to be funny?
I'm fed up.
- Fed up with what?
- Thinking.
Nothing for me.
- Nor me.
I was at the bar.
You can't sit here without ordering.
- We're leaving, anyway.
- No, we're staying.
Give me another coffee.
Nothing for me, get it?
You don't get it.
You can't sit here and not order.
A glass of water with a straw, please.
You should go.
If you're fired you'll blame me.
I won't.
It was my idea to come.
Have you told your parents?
Did you tell Luc?
- We talked about it.
- Did you have to?
At least I told you that I told him!
- What did Luc say?
- Nothing.
- You admire him.
- What are you saying?
- Don't deny it.
- Okay, you win.
Don't you admire anybody?
- You admire yourself.
- I do not.
- You think you're pretty.
- Not really.
Come off it.
I think my body's okay.
And your face?
Don't you think it's pretty?
I think it's pretty.
Luc is sometimes right.
- I hate men who are always right.
You hate him so much?
Some girls go for it.
He's got it together.
Sure!
He can really chow down as long as he's not paying.
He never gets screwed.
Is it good to get screwed?
No, but I feel like everybody's screwing me.
Anyway, he's always right.
And it costs him nothing.
He's broke.
- It suits him fine.
- Don't get angry.
I hate wiseguys who bum off you and despise you for buying a subway pass.
Stop it.
He always talks about being ripped off by society.
Society doesn't get rich from subway crooks like him.
What are you preaching?
Nothing.
I'm going.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Cry, it'll do you good.
Thanks.
You're crazy to thank me.
Do you want a drink?
I don't know.
A shot of scotch?
I'll get it.
Stay there.
I thought I'd had it.
Was it intuition?
Yeah, I know you.
You sure do.
What's "boom"?
Want some?
How can we not split up?
Start by not thinking about it.
It isn't easy.
Don't you ever think about it?
Why do other people split up?
They fall out of love.
Go if you like.
We can't stay here all morning.
I'm going to work.
That's not what I meant.
Sorry.
I'd better go.
- Wait till you feel better.
- I'm better.
I'll get a job, okay?
But I warn you, a lot of things piss me off.
You're telling me.
We'll have to put up with working from now on.
Feeling better?
Ready to go?
I'll get the bill.
I don't want to go.
- Don't go, then.
- We can't go on loving.
- Oh yeah?
Because one day we won't love each other, so we'd better stop now?
Are you going?
I'm out of here.
I've listened to enough bullshit!
Are you coming?
- You're staying here all morning?
- If I want.
You want another argument?
Is that what you want?
You know we'll split.
No, I don't know it.
Everybody splits up.
Everyone's abandoned.
I won't abandon you.
My mother was abandoned, and me, and Sabine.
- I'll never be with anybody.
- Don't say that.
Don't you believe me?
There's the baby.
It's not being with somebody.
Got a name?
Stanislas.
- What if it's a girl?
- It'll be a boy.
You'd rather?
Who is Sabine?
A girl at the hotel.
She fucks a creep who tried to corner me.
- Sounds like quite a place.
- They fuck because they feel abandoned.
- It's not only that.
- It is.
I need to make up a story.
They must have noticed.
What will you say?
The truth.
I'm pregnant, we're breaking up and it takes time.
- You can't say that.
- I will.
Fabien!
You're all muddy?
Where's mommy?
Oh, there she is!
Has he been good?
Have you been here long?
Since 4:30.
We came straight from daycare.
What did they say?
Not much.
I saw that girl, Isabelle.
And?
Nothing special.
She says he never cries.
It's true, he never does.
He cries with me, a little.
You never cried.
I must have cried sometimes.
- Want me to cry now?
- Thanks, I'll pass.
What?
What's this called?
A pebble.
She's making fun of you.
Go and play.
Off you go!
You're pale.
I'm a bit tired.
You shouldn't be tired at your age.
I don't sleep well.
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes.
Don't say that.
It's not true.
- I'm not sick.
- How is work?
- Okay.
- Are you fed up?
- No, it's okay.
- I'm cold.
Aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
Mr. Vasseur is coming to Paris.
Can you get a discount on a room?
I don't know.
I'll ask.
They must do discounts.
- It will still be pricey.
- He has a very good job.
- So why ask for a discount?
As a favour.
I'll repay you the 2,000 next week.
I didn't get to the bank.
Plus the rompers, that's 2400.
Don't pay me back for the rompers.
Thanks, mom.
So you're going to marry Mr. Vasseur?
Yes, and have lots of children.
- Tell me!
- I told you.
You don't want to tell me.
- I barely know him.
- He's coming to see you.
He's coming for the trade fair, too.
Have you slept with him?
Can't I have any privacy?
Go on, mom.
Tell.
I don't know...
I can't make up my mind.
In a way, I'd like to end my life with somebody, but then again...
The thought of this man in my bed every night...
Not necessarily every night.
So he's very...
I see!
So you have slept with him!
- Aren't I allowed to?
- Sure.
- Do you ever think...
- About Mr. Vasseur?
- About starting over with somebody.
- I think about it.
I think I've found him.
Known him long?
- Not very.
But you love him?
Not much.
I can't see you living with a man you don't love.
- You can't?
- Not at all!
Well, it's not true.
- Not true?
- No.
That's a pity.
That I don't have a Mr. Vasseur?
Don't be silly!
Let's go.
We're going home.
Aren't you coming?
- Does he ever see his dad?
- He saw him at Christmas.
Now you're sorry.
Things don't always go the way we'd like.
I don't know about that.
What's Mr. Vasseur's first name?
Does he have one?
Pierre.
Okay, so call him Pierre.
- Your father was a Pierre, too.
- I know.
You do?
Get real, mom!
He was my dad, wasn't he?
He was.
If not, we'll change the story.
- It's the true story.
Any story will do, I suppose.
Are you sorry?
Oh, yes.
I'm not afraid to say so.
I behaved like an idiot with him.
You can't imagine.
I was selfish, arrogant, the whole works.
I was awful to him.
I didn't realize.
It seemed, I don't know... normal.
- You said you didn't love him.
- I thought I didn't.
Now you're saying you did?
In my way.
My way of loving nobody.
The way I saw it then, love was a fairy tale.
If they liked me, that was enough.
- I got my punishment.
- Your punishment?
Yes, I got my punishment.
Not that I'm unhappy.
I've got you and Fabien.
- But as for my life...
- What's Pierre like?
Is he tall, short...?
He's tall, tall.
Is that all?
You don't care.
No, I don't care.
Don't you love him?
Mr. Vasseur will be happy with a pretty little wife.
Come off it!
You still look great for your age.
But you should change your hair, it's gross.
That's better.
Why do you buy blouses like that?
It's so ugly!
It's comfy.
What's up?
What are you looking at?
Oh, no!
You're thinking he'd make me a good little husband.
You're out of your mind!
I don't want one.
I'm sad you're alone.
Knock it off.
I don't want to discuss it.
Can't I help?
- Stop bugging me!
I'm not unhappy.
What good would it do me to live with some nerd?
Come on, little man.
I'm going to call in sick.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
We picked the worst subject to talk about.
Take him.
I'll take the stroller.
Come here, my boy.
Quick, the train's coming.
Hold the gate for me.
We've got time.
We're gonna miss it.
So hurry up!
Here, take him.
Say goodbye.
- I'll call you tonight.
- Call me, okay?
Bye-bye, darling.
Bye!
I'll call you.

SiliconChip :...
A Single Girl [1995]
What are you doing, leaving?
I've been here for hours!
I got stuck in a subway tunnel for at least an hour.
I was leaving.
-Where are you?
-At the bar.
My feet are tired, I want to sit down.
Let's sit over there.
Don't tell me you're gonna sulk.
Okay, okay.
Want to drink something?
-A coffee.
-Won't it make you hyper?
-Is that a dig?
-Yeah, it's a dig.
You're wearing that sweater?
I thought you hated it.
-I never said that.
-You did.
You forgot.
Okay, so what's up?
Nothing.
I'll order the coffees before we fight.
Two coffees, please.
Wait a minute.
Aren't you overdoing it a bit?
Wiggling your butt like that!
Are you nuts?
You don't see the way guys look at you!
What are you, jealous?
Jealous, no.
But you're really flaunting it.
How do you want me to walk?
You're fine.
The hotel guests will get off on it.
You're upset because your team lost so you're gonna sulk for days?
So, what's the news?
Not now.
You're too touchy.
You'll take it badly.
Oh yeah?
So when will you tell me?
Later.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Meantime I'll play some pinball, okay?
You're mean.
I'm mean?
You're a pain!
I am too, but you're the pits!
I know what it is.
Oh yeah?
What?
Sorry.
It's not for me to say.
Downstairs.
Mom?
No, I'm not there yet.
Yes, I told him.
What do you expect him to say?
Don't yell at me.
We haven't discussed it.
I'll call you back.
I'll phone you later.
I went to the john.
Valérie, make up your mind or I'm going.
I'm not telling you now.
You'll take it badly.
You're unbelievable!
Promise...?
I promise nothing.
20 francs!
What a rip-off.
And the coffee's disgusting.
I give you three minutes.
Never mind.
Some other time.
-Three minutes, max.
-What if I need more time?
-I'll walk out.
-That's blackmail.
2 minutes 45.
I'm pregnant.
You finally said it.
Did you know'?
-I was pretty sure.
-Liar.
What else could it be?
That I'm leaving you'?
You wouldn't do it like that.
How would I do it?
Not like that.
What are you gonna do?
Nothing.
-You want to keep it'?
-Yes.
Is that all you can say?
-Are you touched?
-I don't know.
-When did you find out?
-Two days ago.
-You're sure'?
-Yes.
How far gone are you?
Four weeks.
So we have time to think.
It's not a matter of time.
-You don't want me to keep it.
-I didn't say that.
You don't want it.
I don't know!
Why do you want it?
Because I do.
-Even on your own'?
-Yes.
Shit, you never told me you wanted a baby.
-Did you or didn't you'?
-I don't know.
You don't know.
If I hadn't wanted one, I'd have made sure.
Oh yeah?
I've got to go.
-Will you tell them?
-You're kidding.
Okay, you gotta go.
When can we meet again?
I don't...
Friday evening.
Friday evening!
Why not in two weeks or six months.
I'll phone you.
Sure.
Why can't I phone you at your mom's?
I'll come see you at work.
No.
You can't.
What do you suggest?
I'll pop out later.
Wait here.
Be here by 7:30 or I'll come after you.
Do that, get me fired!
You don't work.
You do shit-all.
-Is it my fault?
-Other people find jobs.
It took you a year.
Nine months.
You've got an hour...
What will we say then?
I don't know.
We'll improvise, shit!
Have you got 5 francs?
-I only have a hundred.
-It's okay.
-Just five or six?
-It's on me.
Lady bountiful, huh?
I'm only paying for two coffees.
-What's up?
-Nothing.
Is something wrong?
-Sorry.
I'm talking bullshit.
-You're taking it badly.
Taking it badly?
Shit!
We're having a baby.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing.
Can't they sit any closer?
We could have a conversation.
I've got to go.
Don't go yet.
Let's sit over there.
Can you get me some water?
Thanks.
I look a mess.
You're okay.
I look like death.
I can't go like this.
My parents will flip when I tell them.
-Can't you wait a while?
-Why can't I tell them?
First you don't want it, now you run to tell them.
I didn't say I don't want it.
It would be better in a year or two, when we're set up.
Now we have nothing.
You see us all living with my folks?
People manage.
The hell they do.
Maybe you're not so sure you want it.
Go ahead, tell them.
I don't care.
Once I tell them, I can't tell them the opposite two weeks later.
I'll do what I want.
Rémi?
Meet me here in an hour?
Will you wait for me here?
What's the point if we're only gonna fight?
I'll leave you some cigarettes.
You really...
You really blew me away.
What should I have said?
-You're tough.
-Says you.
You are.
Women are stronger than men.
You'd believe anything.
-My mom's tougher than my dad.
-Yeah, but your dad's a twat.
Your mother isn't?
No way!
She's a pain but she's not a twat.
Says you.
She hates my guts.
At least my dad accepts you.
Sure.
He ogles my ass.
My dad ogles your ass?
And it makes you laugh.
So, are you gonna wait here or walk me there?
I'll wait.
See you at 7:30.
What if you can't get out?
I'll find a way.
You're staying here, right?
No, I'll go pick up the helmet from Luc's.
Didn't I tell you?
They found the bike.
Great.
Yeah.
What did he say...?
It was in a garage in Gentilly.
They were trying to sell it.
The only thing missing was the helmet.
You must be happy.
See you later.
Excuse me, where's the locker room'?
Down there on the left.
Who put this here?
Hello, I start work today.
-Have you checked the schedule?
-No.
Take the 2nd floor.
-You know what to do?
-More or less.
I'll give you your beeper.
Room service, good morning.
Continental breakfast with coffee room 212.
Five minutes.
212, that's you.
You know how this works?
Have you got your passkey?
Here.
Is Mr. Sarre here?
He's probably upstairs.
-What's your name'?
-Valérie Sergent.
Do you want a coffee?
Help yourself.
Take a cup, there.
Miss Sargent, did Mr. Tranh assign you a floor?
Yes, the 2nd.
The 2nd?
You gave Miss Sergent the 2nd floor?
That's Marie-Lisa's floor.
She's off today.
My mistake.
You need to sign your contract.
I'll take you there later.
'Morning, Mr. Sarre.
How's it going?
Hello.
Remember me?
-Yes, from last Friday.
-You had me worried!
You're starting today?
Welcome aboard.
-What's your order?
-Two continentals with coffee.
Don't forget the juice.
Sabine, go with Miss Sergent for her first order.
I have a 3rd floor order for a quarter-to.
Go with Miss Sergent.
They can wait.
-What's your order?
-Coffee continental for two.
Where's your down-up?
Your down-up.
Your order.
Have you been here long?
Two years.
What's it like?
It's okay.
Do I go in with you?
Do I or not?
Of course.
I'm not here to keep you company.
Room service, good morning.
Can you open the curtains please?
Could you sign here?
Doesn't make much difference.
-May I check your minibar?
-Go ahead.
Come and see.
One glance, see what's gone.
Two waters, two whiskies, two tonics, two Cakes...
Miss!
I drank a whisky.
See?
There's one missing.
You get an eye for it.
Do you need anything else, sir?
No, thanks.
-Are you asleep or what?
-I'm not asleep.
You don't say.
My name's Fatiah.
-What's yours?
-Valérie.
Is it your first day?
-Not too lost?
-I'm okay.
Miss Sergent, the guest in 239 wants his breakfast.
-What is it?
-It's on the board.
It was for 6:40, Mr. Faivre.
No more milk?
No more milk.
-There's one carton left.
-Where?
In front of you.
That's one too many.
It's for one!
-Have you done this before?
-At the Sheraton.
Really?
When?
Last year.
I was there too, last year!
-I quit in March.
-Amazing!
I started in April.
You know Béatrice Frechet?
And her husband?
He's too much.
-You know Philippe?
-Naturally.
And that girl, what's her name?
The traveller, ex-hippy...
-Dominique.
-That's it, Dominique.
Why did you quit?
I was sick of it.
I quit because I was on nights.
I never saw my little boy.
Have you got kids?
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.
I didn't touch it.
Miss!
-Shouldn't I sign something'?
-Oh, yes.
Lousy weather again.
It's not very nice.
-Is Paris always like this?
-Often.
Really?
I don't know how you stand it.
Force of habit.
Habit?
That's fine by me, but there's a limit.
Do you need anything else?
I don't think so.
Oh, yes.
Have you a map of Paris?
No, but I can have one sent up or you can call reception.
Buttes Chaumont. ls it far?
Yes, but I can't tell you the way.
My son lives there.
He asked me to lunch because his wife is away.
In secret!
Ridiculous.
Like lovers, with my son.
Why am I telling you this?
Goodbye, sir.
Going HP?
-Did you finish?
-Yes, I'm done.
Is it good'?
-I gave up.
Eric does it.
-On his own?
I help him out.
Bizarre.
Room service!
Not very funny, I agree but if we can't kid around...
Am I bothering you?
...we may as well jump out the window.
You have a sad smile.
You do, honest.
Nobody's ever told you?
I'm surprised.
Mind you, people say I've a happy smile but actually I'm desperate.
I wanted to be a singer.
I write songs.
-But I know I never will.
-Why not?
I'm no good.
Is anybody good?
Some are not bad.
You're a harsh critic.
Souchon, Capdevielle, Johnny Hallyday...
Do you know Capdevielle?
"When you've been in the desert For too long..."
Ring a bell?
You're too young.
Enough chit-chat.
It's wake up time.
Duty calls.
Jean-Marc!
Boiled eggs for 106.
Tell the kitchen.
-Anything for me?
-Two, but Mr. Sarre is looking for you.
-He knows where I am.
-It's about your contract.
Sabine, take 241 and 238.
It's not my floor.
She has to sign her contract.
Terrific!
On top of my own work..
Do 238 at least.
They have a plane to catch.
-Don't look at me like that!
-I'm not.
Come with me.
You'll be back in ten minutes.
Are you settling in okay?
Yes, thanks.
Have you had a tour of the hotel?
You showed me around yourself.
So I did.
Strange.
I phoned her 15 minutes ago.
Do we wait?
We'll wait a bit.
She may have just popped out.
Here she is.
Do come in.
Mrs. Charles, this is Miss Sergent.
She started today, as I told you.
Good.
Why did you leave the Sheraton?
It's rather complicated.
I had a quarrel with a supervisor.
I chose to quit.
A quarrel about what?
Nothing important.
He was always after us.
You left without pay?
About a year ago.
He was always after you?
Yes.
How have you lived since then?
I live with my mother.
I see.
So you're looking for a steady job.
It isn't easy here, either.
You'll have to grin and bear it sometimes.
I'm sure.
Do you feel up to it?
We'll take you on trial to start with, for one month.
After that, we'll see how you fit in.
Right.
Are you on unemployment?
So you'd be sorry not to be taken on permanently?
I'll leave you together.
Thank you.
You live far away.
It's fast by train.
Is it?
What does your mother do?
-Secretary.
-You chose hotel work.
You're not married.
Boyfriend?
What does he do?
He works.
I'm sure.
Although he could be unemployed.
What is his line?
Cars.
Mechanic?
No, he's in sales.
You must think I'm nosy.
I went through this last Friday.
You already had an interview?
Not with me.
We like to double-check.
And there was the Sheraton incident.
There was no incident.
-I heard there was.
-Did you call them?
Surprised?
A little.
I can't take him, I'm in a meeting.
Have him call me later.
Put him through.
I can't talk, I'm in a meeting.
I said I'm in a meeting.
That's completely untrue.
We'll discuss it later.
Régis is skiing with his class.
Eight thousand.
Now sign these.
-You can read them.
-It's okay.
You'll be paid 7,800 francs a month.
Just under 7,000 net.
Fine.
Plus tips.
Keep this one.
You're pretty.
It's a compliment but also a warning, you understand?
I'm not sure.
-I don't want any trouble.
-Why should there be?
It's unfortunate that you're so pretty.
We have a lot of single male guests who try their luck.
I'm used to it.
I'm sure.
That's the problem.
They offer money.
A lot.
I'm not into that.
How was it at the Sheraton?
I told you!
-I didn't...
-This is crazy.
Goodbye, Miss Sergent!
-What's up?
-Nothing.
-You look strange.
-I signed my contract.
It had an effect on you!
I already served four breakfasts for you!
Thanks.
What are you doing?
That's too much.
Did you do 203?
-I'm doing it.
-They're waiting.
-Where's the order'?
-There.
Full breakfast, tea with cold milk, yogurt, the Figaro...
-Where are the cornflakes?
-Up there.
Razor blades, sir'?
Certainly.
These shoes are killing me!
I can't lend you mine.
Room service, good morning.
Could you sign, please?
Room 219.
One champagne split, one mineral water.
Mom, it's me.
I can't talk long.
It's going okay.
I can't discuss it now.
You don't understand!
I don't care.
Sorry.
Mom?
Talk to me.
I was calling the cashier.
Good.
Why're you here?
I was called on my beeper.
-Am I disturbing you?
-I've finished.
Can I get by?
No more phone calls?
-Little slut.
-Cut it out!
Stay away from me!
-You'll tell mom?
-I'll slug you.
-Scared I'll rape you?
-I warn you.
If I report your phone calls
-it'll look bad on your first day.
-You filthy...
Filthy what?
Filthy slob.
-We'll settle this later.
-Yeah, right.
I could use a smoke.
Scrambled eggs in 5 minutes!
-Where is everybody?
-I don't know.
Was there a bomb scare?
Did nobody tell us'?
You Okay?
I have to run out for something.
-For something?
-Drop off some keys.
Leave them with the concierge.
I need scrambled eggs.
The woman in 106 has guts.
She come out stark naked, told me to put the tray on her.
I've had that happen.
A woman asked me to "spend some time" with her.
Her tits, wow!
Nice tits?
Superb!
And the rest of her!
I saw her pussy.
-Don't embarrass the ladies.
-Embarrass?
-She wasn't embarrassed about it.
-Don't get excited.
It takes more than that.
Go for it.
Suite 275.
Breakfast with coffee for two.
Yes, sir.
Don't get any ideas, flunky.
Who's talking?
You like it doggy-style?
Let me get my coffee.
The girl's in heat.
Take a cart, ifs a suite.
Don't worry, he gets these fits.
He's not a bad guy.
He's like that.
I'll leave it here.
She should bring it to the bed.
Come closer, we won't eat you.
Is that the 90-franc breakfast?
No eggs?
I don't like eggs for breakfast.
For 90 francs we should get eggs.
It's 60 francs, ma'am.
Even for 60.
You'd like some eggs?
Yes.
In hotels I like the whole shebang.
-You're not going to eat eggs.
-You bet I am.
Would you like them fried, boiled, scrambled?
Fried.
Not too hard, not too runny.
Fine.
Sign here, please.
-And they make us sign!
-I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'll get your eggs.
I need two fried eggs, now.
Got a smoke?
Mine are in my locker.
I don't smoke.
Mr. Tranh does, though.
-I don't like to ask him.
-Shall I?
-Where can I smoke?
-Back there.
Okay?
Yes, okay.
Everyone keeps asking me.
I heard about your fight.
You sure told off Jean-Marc!
I didn't.
-You didn't?
Patrice says you did.
-Patrice talks too much.
Can I have a drag?
Patrice really digs you.
Fatiah, I want to smoke in peace, okay?
He's a pig but women like him.
The fried eggs are here.
-Did it go okay?
-Fine.
Mrs. Charles is a nice lady.
-What are you doing?
-Checking the towels.
Checking the towels?
I rinsed my hands.
I hope you didn't puke.
-I'm sure you puked in the john!
-Are you crazy?
Jean, call someone!
The maid puked in the bathroom.
You're nuts!
I didn't puke, I rinsed my hands.
Please, I'd like to go.
That's enough.
Let me by.
You're staying here.
What's up?
She threw up in our bathroom.
I checked the towels.
Why are you naked?
Don't yell at me!
Get dressed.
You, get out.
She's nuts.
Mom?
I had to hang up.
A guy came in.
A waiter.
I've forgotten what I had to say.
I don't know.
I'll call you back if I remember.
It wasn't important.
I can't remember!
I don't think so, or I'd remember.
I knew you'd say that.
Talk to you later.
-You scared me.
-I was looking for you.
I felt dizzy.
I had to lie down.
Feeling better?
Are you pregnant?
-You should have said.
-I'm okay, honest.
I'm sorry about before.
I was a little mean.
Because of Jean-Marc.
I saw him looking at you.
I'm jealous.
Not nice, huh?
Everybody...
When is it due?
Not for ages.
Did they miss me in the pantry?
I've been gone a long time.
They'll wait.
What are you doing for lunch?
Nothing.
Can we eat together?
-I don't eat lunch.
-A sandwich?
No way.
This work makes me sick of food.
I can't eat a thing.
We could just have a chat.
I'm going shopping with my sister.
-Want to come?
-I'd love to.
I like shopping.
Where are you going?
-Printemps.
-I prefer Galeries Lafayette.
I have no preference.
Nothing.
Say it.
Don't get shat on.
I'm not getting shat on.
-Don't get screwed.
-Did you?
You have a kid?
You don't know what it's like.
I got screwed.
You're getting screwed.
What are you getting at?
The guy.
The baby didn't make itself.
No...
I don't know.
What are you, a saint?
You're happy.
It shows.
I don't understand.
Understand what?
Unhappiness?
It's simple.
I'll explain.
You're sitting happily up on a cloud and...
You'll understand, I promise.
I hear some guests gave you trouble.
It wasn't serious.
We get oddballs.
-They were weird.
-Hyped up.
It's no joke sometimes.
Miss Sergent.
I had a complaint from room 275.
-It's been dealt with.
-Dealt with?
-With Mr. Sarre.
-Good.
Is it heavy?
Where were you?
Taking a piss.
-Hey, nice outfit!
-Let's sit there.
I'm getting tired of being here.
It's good to sit down.
How's it going?
Okay.
It's work.
-So ifs cool.
-It's not cool at all.
I have worries.
It's a drag.
As soon as one worry disappears,
I get another one.
Don't you ever worry?
Like everybody, I guess.
-Not like me.
-You don't show it.
I know but it screws me up.
My mother's a pain but I can't help phoning her.
I'm holding back.
I want to phone her now.
Work has a weird effect on you.
You can say that again.
Work doesn't affect you?
I walk in on men crying, couples fucking and I stand there, saying
-"Would you like orange juice?"
-Did you say "fucking"?
Watch your mouth!
Sex is all they talk about.
Sounds interesting.
It doesn't turn me on.
You might like it.
Boys often do.
Your colleagues, maybe.
Not me.
I've been doing some thinking.
What about?
What the hell do you think?
Us.
Is that all?
Are you drunk or something?
You're all worked up.
I'm sick of being serious the whole damn time!
-God, you're a pain.
-You wanna talk?
Go on, then!
I'm listening.
You trying to be funny?
I'm just fed up.
-Fed up with what?
-Thinking.
-Nothing for me.
-Nor me.
I was at the bar.
You can't sit here without ordering.
-We're leaving, anyway.
-No, we're staying.
Give me another coffee.
Nothing for me, get it?
You don't get it.
You can't sit here and not order.
A glass of water with a straw, please.
You should go.
If you're fired you'll blame me.
I won't.
It was my idea to come.
Have you told your parents?
Did you tell Luc?
-We talked about it.
-Did you have to?
At least I told you that I told him!
-What did Luc say?
-Nothing.
-You admire him.
-What are you saying?
-Don't deny it.
-Okay, you win.
Don't you admire anybody?
-You admire yourself.
-I do not.
-You think you're pretty.
-Not really.
Come off it.
I think my body's okay.
And your face?
Don't you think it's pretty?
I think it's pretty.
-Luc is sometimes right.
-I hate men who are always right.
You hate him so much?
Some girls go for it.
He's got it together.
Sure!
He can really chow down as long as he's not paying.
He never gets screwed.
Is it good to get screwed?
No, but I feel like everybody's screwing me.
Anyway, he's always right.
And it costs him nothing.
He's broke.
-It suits him fine.
-Don't get angry.
I hate wiseguys who bum off you and despise you for buying a subway pass.
Stop it.
He always talks about being ripped off by society.
Society doesn't get rich from subway crooks like him.
What are you preaching?
Nothing.
I'm going.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
-What are you getting at?
-Nothing.
Cry, it'll do you good.
Thanks.
You're crazy to thank me.
Do you want a drink?
I don't know.
A shot of scotch?
I'll get it.
Stay there.
I thought I'd had it.
Was it intuition?
Yeah, I know you.
You sure do.
What's "boom"?
Want some'?
How can we not split up?
Start by not thinking about it.
It isn't easy.
Don't you ever think about it?
Why do other people split up?
They fall out of love.
Go if you like.
We can't stay here all morning.
I'm going to work.
That's not what I meant.
Sorry.
I'd better go.
-Wait till you feel better.
-I'm better.
I'll get a job, okay?
But I warn you, a lot of things piss me off.
You're telling me.
We'll have to put up with working from now on.
Feeling better?
Ready to so?
I'll get the bill.
-I don't want to go.
-Don't go, then.
-We can't go on loving.
-Oh yeah?
Because one day we won't love each other, so we'd better stop now?
Are you going?
I'm out of here.
I've listened to enough bullshit!
Are you coming?
-You're staying here all morning?
-If I want.
You want another argument?
Is that what you want?
You know we'll split.
No, I don't know it.
Everybody splits up.
Everyone's abandoned.
I won't abandon you.
My mother was abandoned, and me, and Sabine.
-I'll never be with anybody.
-Don't say that.
Don't you believe me?
There's the baby.
It's not being with somebody.
Got a name?
Stanislas.
-What if it's a girl?
-It'll be a boy.
You'd rather?
Who is Sabine?
A girl at the hotel.
She fucks a creep who tried to corner me.
Sounds like quite a place.
They fuck because they feel abandoned.
-It's not only that.
-It is.
I need to make up a story.
They must have noticed.
What will you say?
The truth.
I'm pregnant, we're breaking up and it takes time.
-You can't say that.
-I will.
Fabien!
You're all muddy?
Where's mommy?
Oh, there she is!
Has he been good?
Have you been here long?
Since 4:30.
We came straight from daycare.
What did they say?
Not much.
I saw that girl, Isabelle.
And?
Nothing special.
She says he never cries.
It's true, he never does.
He cries with me, a little.
You never cried.
I must have cried sometimes.
-Want me to cry now?
-Thanks, I'll pass.
What?
What's this called?
A pebble.
She's making fun of you.
Go and play.
Off you go!
You're pale.
I'm a bit tired.
You shouldn't be tired at your age.
I don't sleep well.
-Have you seen a doctor'?
-Yes.
-Don't say that.
It's not true.
-I'm not sick.
-How is work?
-Okay.
-Are you fed up?
-No, it's okay.
-I'm cold.
Aren't you'?
-Yes, I am.
Mr. Vasseur is coming to Paris.
Can you get a discount on a room?
I don't know.
I'll ask.
-They must do discounts.
-It will still be pricey.
-He has a very good job.
-So why ask for a discount?
As a favor.
I'll repay you the 2,000 next week.
I didn't get to the bank.
Plus the rompers, that's 2,400.
Don't pay me back for the rompers.
Thanks, mom.
So you're going to marry Mr. Vasseur?
Yes, and have lots of children.
-Tell me!
-I told you.
You don't want to tell me.
-I barely know him.
-He's coming to see you.
He's coming for the trade fair, too.
Have you slept with him?
Can't I have any privacy?
Go on, mom.
Tell.
I don't know...
I can't make up my mind.
In a way, I'd like to end my life with somebody, but then again...
The thought of this man in my bed every night...
Not necessarily every night.
So he's very...
I see!
So you have slept with him!
-Aren't I allowed to?
-Sure.
-Do you ever think...
-About Mr. Vasseur?
-About starting over with somebody.
-I think about it.
