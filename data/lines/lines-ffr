Hi,Tim.
Howareyouall ?
We'redefinitelyhelpingeach other out, and I think our styles will collide.
Collide...
Orconverge?
Both:
Converge.
Okay.
Ithinkwe 'll...
They'vecollidedalittle bit, but...
We'regonnago forthis little Spanish feel.
She'sa bullfighter?
Both:
Yes.
Ole!
Pshew!
Juliehasbeenworkingon that jacket forever.
Butit'scute.
Lookatthisbeautiful...
Wefoundthisgreatfabric.
And I think it's gonna create like a great--
Ithinkit 'ssmashing.
Smashing.
IloveJoshuaM's pants.
It reminds me of Beetlejuice.
Carryon.
Appreciateit.
CeceliaandDanielle,how are you doing?
Good.
We're doing sort of a tailored blouse with a teal chiffon with a big, huge, billowy sleeve.
Okay.
Andtheseareour fabrics.
We're using a lot of materials that we both like.
Sowhenshewalks,youknow, these sleeves will billow back.
And it's all about movement.
Yeah.
Well,it'sallaboutthe proportion of the bottom garment to the top garment.
And it just needs--needs to work.
Theproportionsareso different, we are unfamiliar with how this look will fit.
ViktorandBert.
Talk to me.
Iguesswe wantedtostart with a bodice and do something very tight.
And also, a little bit of structure, just to create the drama.
Drama'simportant.
But this isn't intended to be a costume.
No,no.
No .
GoodLord.
That thing is ghastly.
Ithinkhe wasthinkingof doing it this way, and I was thinking of doing it the other way.
Iwantedto do acontemporary look, and he was at, "Well, I really think we should do this."
And I had some other ideas, and, no, this is what we have to do.
No,that'snottrue.
Whenever I suggest, "that doesn't work;
Maybe we could do something like this," and automatically, he goes, "That's not gonna work.
This won't work."
So right now, I'm in the point where I'm just kind of trying to get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtrying-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Areyouworried?
It's nerve-racking, because this thing might fall apart.
No,no,likethis.
I mean, this is up because I listened to you.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
I'mjustkindoftryingto get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtryingto-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
CanI tellyouwhatconcerns me about our conversation?
I don't think I've heard either of you say "We."
This has to be a "We."
Yeah.
Itneedsto be .
Yeah.
Well,earlier,he said,
"This is your design," and I said, "No, it's not."
No,I didn'tsaythat.
Youdid.
Whateveryou'regoingtodo, you need to do it now.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Wow, color.
Red.
Red.
When you said "Paris," that's the big key word, that did it for me, having that dramatic feel to it.
Theseshoulderpadsare very on trend for fall.
We'remakingtheskirtoutof this.
Then we're lining it with the charmeuse that we made these out of, so I'm-- andyoufeelyou can control this well enough?
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, if you can pull this off, I think it's a wow moment.
That'swhatwe wantto hear, right?
Yeah.
Becky and Kimberly.
Beckykindof thoughtof military, and I kind of was like punk, which the model was totally for and about.
Andshehasatattooonher collarbone.
Mm-hmm.
Andsowe wentwitha one-shoulder so we could see this great tattoo over here.
Oh.
Ijustmadethe greensleeve and now I'm gonna make one in the stripe to see which one we like better.
I'mhopingthatthisworksin the stripe.
Yeah.
You'veworkedwelltogether?
Yeah.
She makes good pants, I make good jackets.
We divide and conquer.
Great.
Thankyou.
Thanks,Tim.
IfeellikeIhave ablack cloud over me.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
How are you feeling?
I--I'mgood.
I'm-- youare?
I'mjustworriedit'sgetting too big.
Heidi said, "Go big."
I was gonna keep going.
This is my gut telling me to stop.
Youlistento yourgut , both of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatisthistextilebeing used for?
Um,sothisisgonnabethe bodice.
I liked the polka dot because I felt that it gave some color and some pop, which is me.
Rightnow,Ireallywant
Fallene to get this bodice done so that we can worry about the pants.
Okay,go.
Go ,go ,go .
Thankyou.
AnyaandOlivier.
I'd love to hear what you're doing.
Well,theideawas ,uh, because Olivier's really menswear and I do womens wear, we have this polar opposite way of working and way of seeing things.
Ithinkthismakesyoua great team.
Yeah,andso it 'sgonnahave this tight feeling of, like, things holding her.
Uh-huh.
Andthisgoingontopof this.
I'llbeblunt.
I think it's unexpected.
Timseemsalittlethrownoff by our fabric selections.
Maybe he just doesn't know how to say, "I don't like it."
Bye,everybody.
Bye, Tim.
Havea goodnight.
Thanks.
Youtoo.
Bertzilla.
Bertzilla,yousaid?
Yeah.
Isthatmy newname?
I'mgonnacutthissoit won't be boggy.
Yeah,yeah,cool.
Unlessyouwantthat.
No,it'scool.
Beautiful.
Timdidmentionall heheard was "I, I, I," which is true, but I am willing to just start again, like, leave that behind and enjoy the moment.
Becauseofthat,thisis taking forever.
I'm sorry.
Justgetit done.
Iwill.
IthinkBryceand Falleneare in trouble because even though they have this great, voluminous tutu that's really impressive looking, there's nothing else that they have.
And I know Fallene's having trouble getting the bodice done.
Isitalmostdone?
It'sdone,butwhatelse do we need to sew?
ThecincherthatIwasgonna have you do, it's basically here's the two pieces together.
I'm showing Julie a quick and effective way to get a ruching effect for the waistband.
Leave these two ends open and stitch this one side down.
And then you're gonna have to grab this.
Oh,yeah,yeah.
Bringitallthe way overto here, and then it's all gonna shrink into itself and it's just gonna make, like, a great cover belt.
Perfect.
I'minsuchbad shapewith this.
We don't have time.
No,golikethis,golike this.
Here.
Go just like-- no,no.
Likethis.
Imadethisisedup because I listened to you.
No, I really don't care about anymore.
I'll make interfacing.
I'm sorry.
Itiswhatitis,Danielle.
Attheendofthenight ,I'm already concerned because it's a one-day challenge and chiffon takes double the time.
Hello.
Thisisso weird.
Howdoyouput pantson?
Pantsfirst,thenstilts.
I'venever,like-- neverhemmedagiantbefore.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
It's like Alice in Wonderland.
Thisisafantasy.
It's not a costume, okay?
That's the word.
It's fantasy.
Howlongdo we have?
Ten minutes?
Whyareyouworried?
Well,I wantto seeitcome together.
Nowitlookslikeamess.
Yeah.
Oh,myGod.
It's gonna come out okay.
Doyouhaveabodicetofit on her?
Yeah.
Oh,good.
Holdthatand,like...
Is it?
I'll re-cut it.
I know, it's--it's looking weird.
It'soff-grain.
It'slookingweird.
.
Okay.
Once I put the bodice onto her,
I thinking, oh, why is this all wonky?
And didn't even realize that I didn't cut it on-grain.
I just feel like I can't do simple things right now 'cause
I'm, like, so tired and on edge.
WhenFallenecutsthe bodice off-grain, it's a big deal, and you have to immediately re-cut.
I'm worried that she won't have enough time to do something like that.
I just--I don't know how this is gonna go.
Seeyoutomorrow.
Ciao.
Bye.
Itlooksokay.
Actually, this looks nice.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to snap at you, it's just there is no time for getting fancy at this point.
Oh,Bryce.
What happened to me today?
This is really bad.
Ihaveafeelingwe'regonna be in the bottom two or the bottom three.
Itjust--it'sjustreally disappointing.
I let Bryce down 'cause I just could not finish my garment, so it's...
I'm sorry.
It'sokay.
It'sreallygonnalookbad for you.
I'm so sorry.
Allright,guys,let 'smove.
Areyouexcitedfor today?
I'mwonderingwherewe're going.
That's the exciting part.
Ithinkouroutfitlooks good.
Ithinkit looksvery,very good.
It's--it'sdefinitelywhat you and I put together.
IthinknowI'm okaywith it.
Yesterday, I was a little bit hoping for a thunderstorm.
Everyonewasintense yesterday.
Some people here, they can whip up so fast, you know?
Like, I feel like I'm not at that level to do that.
Dothebestyou can .
Just do the best you can.
IwishIhad mysoul right now.
I feel like I'm kind of-- well,maybeyou'llfinditin the workroom today.
Maybe it's sitting under a table just waiting for you.
All right.
Later.
Let'sgo.
Well,sincewe finishedon time, we can chill.
Maybegluesomeofthefabric from here?
Sure.
I'mgonnafigureout whether or not we can do, like, a tube top or something like that.
Westillhavealotofthis left.
I'mnervousaboutwhatpeople are gonna think.
The bodice is cut off-grain, so it's a mess.
We could send it down but I feel like it's too bad.
Brycedecideslastminuteto just put together a tube top, and I just let him take over at that point.
Falleneissweet.
Bryce really pushed her around a bit.
He's very sort of a bossy kid.
Oh,youchangedthe top ?
Itwasnotcut on-grain.
Oh,right.
Like,itlookedlikeitwas melting or something awful.
Ithinkthatlooks--that'll look nice.
Yeah.
Okay, we're done talking about it.
It needs to be sewn, because this jacket has taken you over
12 hours and-- itlooksgreat.
Oh,Julie.
Oh!
Oh,Julie.
Didyou--didyou--didyou manage to stitch some of the shoulder last night?
No,itwassotighttothe mannequin.
I didn't have time to sew everything perfectly.
It's nerve-racking because I'm worried that this thing might fall apart.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Thisisgoingtobeahugely jam-packed morning.
In an hour and a half, we are leaving the workroom for our outdoor runway.
Ithasn'tbeendoneonthe show before, and to be a part of the first public runway makes me completely speechless.
IfeellikeI'm running around with my head cut off, 'cause I don't think that I'm gonna have enough time to sew up a new top.
Comingupon project runway...
Thehairlookslikea pumpkin.
Iknowwe bothdon 'tthink this is our best work.
We'reheadedto ourfirst outdoor runway ever.
I'msortof freakingout .
No,you'regonnabefine .
Idon'tthinkthere'sany making this attractive.
Son of a bitch.
Bryceiscompletelystressed out, and I felt bad but after seeing what he's producing, I'm sort of freaking out.
Idon'tknow.
Maybe I should put the zip in.
Idon'tfeelthat'sright.
I don't know.
I'mjust--I'mhonestlyso frustrated right now.
I mean, I know we both don't think this is our best work.
Like,ifwe justadd ,like,a couple little-- foryourjacket.
It'smajor.
IfJoshwantstobedazzle,
I'm gonna let him do it.
Wehavealot moretodo-- all the finishing work on the skirt and then attach it to the bodice.
I'm just hoping we have enough time.
IknewIwantedtocreatea headpiece, knowing that this is a team effort and I didn't create anything.
And so I got the red feathers.
I broke 'em up with some of the fabric to kind of bring something interesting to this garment.
It'sbeautiful.
It's really stunning.
ThisistheJoshside .
Andyouseweditbeautifully.
It's sewn beautifully.
With Julie, I knew it could go one of two ways--completely horrible or amazing between both of us, and I think that we're gonna do something that might shock a lot of people.
Designers,I amsendingin your models.
You will have an hour to send your models to the L'Oreal Paris makeup room and the Garnier hair studio.
The Piperlime wall, of course, is important here.
I'm being very strict about the schedule this morning because we have a curtain call, everyone.
Right.
Allright?
Thank you.
Makeitjustatadbit tighter.
Josh,youwanttodomakeup?
I think you're gonna be better at that than I will.
I'llwageryouthat.

I don't want it to look Asian, though.
We'renotgoingtokabuki.

'Cause there's a whole bunch of royalty.
Yeah,um,up andoff tothe side a little bit?
So very dramatic.
Do you think you've got it?
It'skindof vague,but we'll--we'll kind of work with it.
I'msotired.
Oh,no.
That'snotwhattheywant .
Thanksforthat.
Thehairlookslikeahuge pumpkin on her head.
There was nothing we could do at this point because we had to walk out of there.
Designersandmodels,let 's go.
We're headed to our first outdoor runway ever and we're gonna have a blast.
I'mnotexcitedfor the runway show.
No, I'm terrified.
I'm thinking, like, that I could have made this work but instead
I just let him take over and we're in trouble.
Herewego .
Where'smybigleopardbag?
Thankyou,Tim.
Ooh!
Wehavethishugeevent, bigger than actually I think any of us really thought it was going to be, and it's all taking place in battery park.
It still does not feel real.
Ihaveto saythatifIhad to have my show out in the middle of New York Harbor, I'd be a little nervous.
I'mjustoverjoyedbythis , being outdoors as well as all the press and it being the first time this has ever happened, everything is just exhilarating.
Andrightdownhere.
Behindthestageatthe runway show, it's just madness.
Backstage,I 'mpanicked.
After seeing all the fans and press and seeing my garment, I just fell apart.
I'mdisappointedthatI didn't make anything.
Butlisten,it 'sa collaboration between the two of you and you're responsible for the entire look.
We do the best we can under the conditions.
We do the best we can, all right?
IfeellikeI'm not evena designer right now.
I'm just, like, really disappointed.
Don'tbe.
No, you're gonna be fine.
Comingupon Project
Runway...
It'ssounbelievablytacky.
Itlookslikeabadcostume.
Andthenthehairiscrazy !
Westillhavetoknow , though, who is responsible for this mess.
Hi,everybody.
It's been my dream to do this show once outside in front of all of our fans.
Thank you very much for coming, everybody.
This is our first Project Runway live show outside, and we're very excited.
These are all of our new designers.
Welcome.
Our judges--fashion designer
Michael Kors.
And of course the lovely Nina
Garcia.
And our guest judge today, Kim
Kardashian.
Welcome.
Okay, everybody, enjoy the show.
Ifeelreallyproudtobe seeing my garment on my model.
It's just a surreal moment for me, and I hope that it's the first of many to come.
Shelookslikeabedazzled
Spanish matador.
I mean, yeah, it was a little showy, but I thought it was appropriate for the event.
It'sbiganddramatic,but the stilt models really freak me out.
They look like aliens or something.
Ihaveafeelingofregret that I was encumbered with
Viktor.
If I'd been by myself, my design would have been amazing in this setting, and I believe it would have been a knockout.
I'mexcitedbutalsoworried, because I wasn't so confident in what we had done.
Had we finished that bodice, we would have had a really cute look.
Now I'm just kind of worried about it.
I'mthinking,it 'samateur hour.
We both feel that we are gonna be on the chopping block.
I'm, like, super emotional right now.
Mymodelwasalittleawkward in her walking.
It's just really strange, but she was wearing borrowed stilts.
Maybe that had something to do with it.
I'mverypleasedwithour look and I think it will go over really well.
The only think I would change is the pointed collar that Becky put on the shoulder pad.
I told her that it was too Star
Trek looking, but I think we fulfilled the challenge.
Ithinkit 'saverycool garment, but if we could have speeded things up, we probably could have done a better job.
I'mpleasedthatitlooks beautiful but I really feel that this could have been super dynamic.
Regardless of how simple the dress is, it's still a pretty sight.
I'mthinking,like,thisis beautiful.
The pants and the top fit perfectly, and they're flowing beautifully.
But then, when you get up to the hair, we were like, uh-oh.
Shelooksgreat.
You couldn't see any resemblance of a stilt in there, and I was afraid of that.
But I know that they are gonna hit me hard with the hairstyling.
It's just traumatic.
IreallythinkthatAnthony and I have a really good chance in having the winning design.
It's chic, it's Parisian couture, just like Tim said, but yet it's got drama involved.
The charmeuse skirt is flying, the pants look beautiful and full.
It's just perfect.
I'msuperproudofjust what
Laura and I have accomplished.
Ours is definitely the wow dress.
I'm amazed at how the fabric just went.
It's just phenomenal.
Didyouenjoyshowingoff your work to a live audience today?
Verymuch.
Weexpectedto see show-stopping garments today, and we were very impressed by some of your designs, but others didn't do as well as we expected.
The winner of this challenge will receive immunity and cannot be eliminated for next week.
Olivier, you won the last challenge, so today you cannot be eliminated.
We scored your designs as they came down the runway.
One of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
Olivier, Anya, your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Anthony, Laura, Danielle,
Cecilia, Kimberly, Becky, your teams had the highest scores.
Yes.
JoshuaandJulie,Bertand
Viktor, Fallene and Bryce, your teams had the lowest scores.
We're going to talk to the team with the highest scores first and then we'll bring you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Itwasamess.
It really was a mess, I'm sorry to say this.
I feel like ours is--they're gonna say harsh things.
Well,here'sthefunnything.
If you look at it, costume, costume, costume.
Yeah.
Who'sontherunway?
Ready to wear, ready to wear, ready to wear.
Itjustfeelsveryhorrible, the wait, like somebody punched you in the stomach and threw you down on the stage.
Anthony,Laura,tellusabout your look.
Wedecidedon thecolorred.
You know, we wanted a wow.
Carla was gonna just, when she walked out, it was like, whoa.
Ilikedit alot .
I think it was dramatic enough.
I loved all those little pieces.
You know, you can always tell when designers do that, it means so much work.
I guess most people probably think it's just, like, thrown on there and glued together.
Ididnothand-sewanyof that.
It is all with a hot glue gun.
ScrapwhatIsaidbefore.
Well...
Ilovedthislook.
I love that color.
I love the detailing of the little black belt.
This looked so elegant, not costumey at all.
It looks amazing.
Ireallylikethis.
I thought it was very beautiful, the way it flowed and the way the wind made it move was beautiful.
My only worry--and Anthony, we've had this on two occasions with you--is it's a little referential to me.
It looks like something that
I've seen, so please try to be original when you design.
But other than that, it is absolutely beautiful.
Ithinkthetrickiestthing to do is, if you scaled it down and she wasn't on stilts, would it still be fabulous?
And I think it would still be fabulous.
Butwhotakesmore responsibility for this gorgeous look?
Well,I toldherbeforewe got here, I was like, if we get up there, I want you to take it.
That'snice.
All right, Danielle, Cecilia, tell us about your look.
Itreflectsverymuchwhat we do.
Uh, we wanted to create elegance.
So,whodidwhatexactly?
Whenwesawthe stiltwalkers,
I instantly thought of doing a huge sleeve, so I was really married to the blouse idea and then Cecilia came up with the pants.
Ilikethislook.
I like the blouse.
I like the color combination.
I like the brown pants and I like the way you constructed them.
I like the sheerness, that you can see through.
I think that's very nice.
What ruins it for me is her head.
Thehairis crazy!
I mean, my God!
Ilovethislook.
I think this is so chic, and I love bling, and I do love that detailing, and I think the thing that stood out to me the most was just that color, I think, is so rich.
Thankyou.
Thankyou,Kim.
It'sa veryprettyoutfit.
Ithoughtyoupickeda beautiful fabric, but it's about drama, and it's too quiet.
Listen,youpickedthe trickiest fabric in the world.
I mean, chiffon, and to do it impeccably is--it takes so much time.
Wewereverycomfortable using chiffon, which everybody thought it was a bit crazy, given the restraint on time.
Mm-hmm.
Anditwasactuallyacrazy idea.
Becauseyoucandoa chiffon pant like that and make someone just look like a mess, and she doesn't.
KimberlyandBecky,tellus about your look.
Weknewinstantlywhenwegot our model that we wanted to do something edgy.
We wanted to play on each other's strengths.
So she's strong in jackets.
I like structure, so I wanted to do a tailored pant.
Iwasveryimpressedwhen I saw this outfit.
You tailored the pants and it still is a showstopper because it is so sharp, because it is almost perfect.
Thankyou.
Ithinkyouguysarekick-ass tailors.
I mean, you really cut a mean pant.
Thankyou.
Thanks.
Thankyou.
It'llmakeeverywomanwho wants to wear it want to get that tattoo.
You need the tattoo.
Ilovethepants.
Oh,thankyou.
Lovethepants.
My only detail that I feel could have been edited is that half-collar.
It just looks a little circusy.
But all in all, it was one of my favorite looks too.
Thankyou.
Nowwe'regoingtotalk to the designers with the lower scores.
Thank you very much.
You can leave the runway.
Bert, Viktor, tell us about your look.
Ichosethebottompart 'cause I wanted it to be a little bit more modern and thin.
And Bert chose the top part.
We did--had our little struggles, and we did--had miscommunications and things like that.
Tome,it 'slikethe wallpaper and curtains at a really tacky catering hall.
Mm-hmm.
Ihatethatdustruffleof gold on the top of it.
It's just, it's really old.
It'salmostlikeinthemovie
The Sound of Music, when they took the drapes off and made their clothes, but like Marie
Antoinette days.
It really does look like curtains.
Ithinkit lookslikeabad costume.
It's terrible.
Idon'tbelievethatthis was what I wanted to present.
Soyouthinkit'shis responsibility.
Ididn'tcreatethis.
Okay.
Viktor, what do you think?
Iownit .
I think we both worked at it at the end and we finished it and--
Sowhenyousay ,"Iownit,"
it means that it was your idea.
Imean,Iown the workwith him because we both did very much 50-50.
"Iownit "?
50-50 is not "I own it."
No,like,no ,notown it.
I guess I'm being responsible for it.
Sothatmeansifthis outfit today is the worst look, you would be the one to go home?
Oh,no.
No, no.
Well,then,that'snot owning it.
Bert,you'returningslightly lobster color.
Oh,amI?
Sorry.
He was very emphatic about, "I want to do this, we need to do a
Victorian," and I found it unusual that he wouldn't sketch.
He said, "Well, you sketch it.
You sketch better."
Whywouldyounot sketch something?
No,I-I--no,Idid sketch.
No,youtoldme, "Bert,you sketch, you sketch."
It'sinmy HP computer.
Itseemslikeyou two had a lovely day yesterday.
Yes.
Allright,fromone strange look to the next, Fallene and
Bryce, tell us about your outfit.
Ihadtheidea,becausewe were working with such long legs, that we could do a really, really big, kind of full tulle skirt and then we were gonna have cute little details up on the top.
Butliterally,yougavehera
Black Swan.
Yeah.
Idon'tgetit.
Thishasno effortput into it.
It does look like just a tank top that I wear to bed and it looks like a tie wrapped around the waist a couple times.
This just looks like you could have done this in 15 minutes.
Youknow,Ithinktheidea had so much promise.
However, there's nothing.
There's no detail.
It's just the beginning of something.
It's--it's--likeyousaid, it's, like, half done.
Soit'slikenonedone ,then .
Yeah.
Iloveherheadpiece.
I think the headpiece is nice.
Well,I 'msogladImade something.
Ithinktheheadpieceis great.
Listen, to me, it's like she's got every dance reference and it ends up just looking like nothing because they don't meld.
SoBryce,if thiswas the worst look, who do you think should go home?
Um,I thinkbothofus.
I think that--I think this was a team effort.
Unfortunately,itwouldbe only one.
IthinkIshouldbeableto stay.
I did my best.
Iwouldsaymyself.
IwouldsayFallene.
Josh,Julie,tellusabout your look.
Well,I cameup withthe concepts.
Andtheconceptwas circus?
No,itwasmatador.
Ole,ole,ole!
I mean, guys, you know, drama doesn't mean tacky.
Spanishmatador,youcan be inspired by that, you know, and that could be really chic.
You know, we've seen it.
Ijustthinkit'syetanother
Halloween costume.
It's the weirdest hybrid I've ever heard of.
Andshe'sgotthesetiny arms and these extremely long legs.
It gives her a very bizarre-- when she walked out, I was like, huh.
Forget the matador, circus, and all that.
Theonlypositivethingthat
I could say about this outfit is, it looks well made.
Iagree.
Imean,it is sharp.
That it is, definitely.
So if we decide that this is the worst look for today, who should go home?
Well,itwasmyidea ,andI 'm not gonna throw Josh under the bus.
Whatdoyouthink,Josh ?
Iwouldhopenot togohome, and I would not choose myself.
Soyou'resayingyou would choose Julie.
Yes,I wouldchooseJulie.
Okay,sowe 'veheardwhat you had to say.
We're gonna have a little chat and then I'll call you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Thankyou.
Let'stalkaboutthe designs and the designers that we did like today.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Thegarmentreallylooked modern, dramatic, exciting.
Well,itwasthe rightchoice of color, it was the right way to do the pants, and it still looks like a gown.
Ithoughtit wasbeautifulon the model wearing stilts, and I could picture it on a woman without the stilts.
Thatwaspretty.
Then we have Danielle and
Cecilia.
Ihappenedto likethat outfit.
I think it's just really chic.
Andthebeadingwas beautiful.
Theplushereistotakethat chiffon and make something that is finished beautifully.
The chiffon, if you make a mistake, she's in a rag.
DanielleandCecilia,they both know how to sew.
Oh,yeah.
Theydo.
Yousawit here.
BeckyandKimberly.
Thesimpletruthis, they sent out something impeccably tailored.
The pants were fantastic.
Andtheproportionswere right.
Yes.
Italsodidn'tlooklike two designers did something and they stuck it together.
Butrealistically,theyhad a very cohesive look.
Yeah,I thoughtthatit looked like it was done by one person.
Metoo.
Let'stalkaboutthe designers that we didn't like.
Even though it was Julie's idea to make this circus matador outfit, I can still see Josh's bedazzling in there.
They'reanoddteam,when you think about Julie and Josh.
Julie is, you know, rocky, you know, mountain woman, and Josh is like, bedazzle it, glamorous, and kind of those two things together ended up with this insane, very tacky matador outfit.
Yeah.
Youareadesigner.
You're selling design, you're selling taste.
Imean,therewas likeso many details, you didn't know where to look.
It was crazy.
Bryce and Fallene.
Yougetto theBlackSwan /Bob
Fosse combo.
I mean, the hat was the only thing that had any bit of charm or, I don't know, personality.
Itlookedliketwo different eras.
It was like showgirl hat, ballerina--I--you know, it didn't go together at all.
Yeah.
Dance hall girl, modern dance, and ballet, all combined.
What if they hadn't had-- aninspiration.
There was nothing.
It was a promise of an idea, but they couldn't deliver anything.
I mean, I'm not defending Bryce, but I think at least he's got a little more spunk.
Buttheonlythingthat we did like was the hat, and she made the hat.
Ifthehatwasn'tthere,you really would have fallen asleep.
ViktortotallythrewBert under the bus.
He didn't really say it, but he did.
Well,BertthrewViktorunder the bus too.
IjustthinkthatViktoris full of it, and he just--
Idotoo.
Youknow,IbelieveBert when he says he didn't do a drawing and all of that stuff.
Shouldn'tBerthavesaid,
"You know what?
I think this thing is not working."
It's ugly drapes.
I mean, they're ugly drapes.
Awfulfabric.
Everythingbadin thehouse on your body.
Sowe'vemadeour decision?
Okay, let's bring them back out.
Your teams represent the highest and the lowest scores.
One designer will be the winner of this challenge and one designer will be out.
AnthonyRyanandLaura,you two did a great job.
Laura, congratulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
That means that you have immunity next time.
Anthony Ryan, we think that you also did a great job.
Laura and Anthony Ryan, you can leave the runway.

Bert, you're in.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
BryceandFallene,yourlook was boring ballerina.
It looked like there was no effort put into it.
Bryce, you're in.

Iwasn'treadyfor Joshto go.
He has so much talent, and there's people like Fallene that don't even know really what their direction is at this point.
She talks to much about being a hairstylist, I'm not even sure if she's a designer, you know?
Mm-hmm.
[Yawning]Oh,man.
I'm just freakin' nervous for today.
I'm like, maybe I'm too much of a normal person.
I never thought I would be normal, but...

There'sa bigbull's-eyeon the two of us.
Forthefirsttimeever on

[All gasp]
Whoa.
I got goosebumps.
Just the bigness of it is very, very exciting to me.
Soyourjobistomakesure that your look will stand out...
But be in at the same time.
Good luck, everybody.
And we all will see you on the outdoor runway.

You know, obviously, sometimes-- no,yeah,keepgoing.
Youknow?
Talktome ,becauseifyou talk and I can draw-- butsometimes,we canhave them like they're coming out of something, you know?
Right.
Iwasthinkingmorelike old
Hollywood.
Something more classic, so...
MaeWest?
Yeah,like,evenMae West.
Exactly.
Like it's a--it's-- you can make it have pants.
MaeWestneverworepants.
Her entire life.
No, she didn't.
She wore skirts.
Bertistoodefensive.
He needs to calm down.
[Indistinct chatter]
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Howexcitedareyou about this challenge?
It's completely thrilling.
I want you to think about a couple of things.
Think about Paris Couture Week.
It causes you to question what's real and what isn't.
Very much like this challenge.
I'm always looking at fashion illustrations, which I happen to love, but I always say, "These aren't real women."
Well, for this challenge, they are.
Everyonealwayssaysthat when I draw my fashion figures, they're so, like, long.
It's kind of like our fashion illustrations get to come to life.
It's a pretty exciting challenge, I think, for all the designers.
Iambringinginyour stilt walker models.
You will have 30 minutes to consult with them as a team.
We're going shopping at Mood, and each team will have a budget of $500.
Whoo!
Andyouhaveone day for this challenge.
So it's today.
Noway.
Way.
Areyoucrazy?
SoI 'msendingin your models.
Have fun!
Doesithavetobepants ?
Iwouldimagine.
Probably.
Sothatyoucan-- thedresswouldget tangled.
Yeah,yeah.
That'd be a disaster.
Oh,great,Ihavenevereven talked to her.
She's never really talked to me.
But we agreed on kind of a look and a style, and realized, "Oh, she makes great pants."
And I make great tailored jackets, so...
That's what we're doing.
Yes.
Hey,ladies.
Over here.
Hi,howareyou ?
[Overlapping chatter]
Sithere.
Okay.
Icancrouchall the way down to, like...
Like that, or-- whataboutsleeves?
Does that bother you?
Howisit ,walkingin something...
Long and full?
Itisimportantthatit's not below where my feet fasten into my stilts.
Whereyourstiltis.
Becauseitcausesyou to tumble.
Ourinspirationforthis design, we're thinking Parisian couture.
Just a really flattering silhouette, and not make her look like she's in the circus, walking down a runway.
Theway--I'mthinkingdrapey.
Okay,realdrapey.
Okay.
I'mthinkinglikethis.
Butthinkcircus-ytoo .
Oh,I--Iam .
Like, think about it moving back behind her.
Like, it's gonna be like flowing and moving.
So Fallene and I know that we want to do a big, full skirt.
And we're inspired by our model.
She has been a ballerina forever.
She's got tattoos, funky hair.
We definitely want to go with this kind of dark ballerina.
KindoflikeQueenVictoriaa little bit, like, just...
Oh,that'sverygood.
Alittlebitbig here.
Nice, big, like, open here.
But maybe a big collar.
But it's sexy here.
Uh-huh.
QueenVictoriawasin mourning for 50 years.
I don't think that's a sexy direction I would like to go into.
Ifyoudo adressthat 'slike a bust like here, her boobs are gonna be showing like this.
That'snotVictorian.
That's Elizabethan.
Well,whatever.
Well,there'sadifference.
Bertisaknow-it-all.
He's just very obnoxious.
Viktorreallyneedstodoa little bit of book reading.
Designers...
Say good-bye to your models.
They will be back later today for a fitting.
[Indistinct chatter]
Bye!
Thankyou,ladies.
All right, let's head out to our first trip to Mood.
So follow me.
Design teams, here we go.
Your 30 minutes begins...
Right now.
Alittlebithere,here , here, and more here, and then boom.
Viktor.
Bert,darling.
Whereareyou?
Whereareyou?
Backhere.
Look.
Follow my voice.
Iwantto to ,like,akimono with this, and then have big sleeves, and not go-- sobigsleevesmeancouture?
I literally had to bite my tongue.
How much training do you have in couture?
What'sthis?
Ourgameplanistojustpull every red shade that we like.
We have our grocery list.
So it's just a matter of executing it.
Yeah,I likethispattern better.
Butasfarasthat ,Ifeel like it should be more modern.
Areyoutwoall right?
Yes,we'regreat.
Okay.
You're kind of a dream team.
So...
We'rehavingagoodtime .
Wehavehighexpectations.
Iwaslookingforwardtoa team challenge, and to have one with Oliver, it is a dream.
Canthisbe pleated?
Ugh.
Julie,anythingin lifecan be pleated.
She was rockin' my nerves.
Ooh,I likethetextureof this.
Chiffon is the lightest of all the fabrics you can grab.
It's like this...
[Exhales]
Of silk.
So I think it'd be cool to do something that's almost a muted, like, really muted polka dot.
This is way too [bleep]-- insteadofthedenim?
Yeah.
Okay,gofindit.
I'mnotsettlingfor all black.
We're not creating a freakin' gothic...stilt walker.
Youhavetwominutes remaining.
Oh!
Okay.
Soweneedtohurryup.
Yes,weneedtohurryup.
Thankyou.
Thereisnothinglikeit,so
I'm just grabbing anything.
Geta lotof it .
Allright,designers.
Time is up.
Design teams at the register.
Anya, you're walking the wrong way.
So let's head back to Parsons.
Thank you, Mood!
All:
Thankyou!
Hey.
Yeah,let'snotfocussomuch on this.
Well,that'spartofthe dress.
I'mnotsayingwe're building a-- no,I 'mnotdisagreeingwith anything you're saying, though.
Ijustwanttomake sure we know what we're going as far as units.
We've agreed on the silhouette.
It's going to be a strapless bustier piece, and then there'll be this full skirt.
MayI haveyourattention, just for a moment?
You have until 9:00 tonight.
All right, work hard.
I will see you later.
Thank you.
Doyoufeelcomfortable making very well-fitting pants?
I'mcomfortablewithpattern making, so...
Okay,foryour...
Otherlooks, were you happy with the fit?
Lady,I makecustom-made clothing for people with all kind of bodies.
I know how to fit pants.
YouknowthatIwantedthe other prints, right?
Like a more modern print.
They might say it might be dated, 'cause it's a little bit too flowery.
It's gonna be definitely a challenge to work with that ugly fabric.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
Ithinkthisfabricis genius.
Assoonas he foundthe fabric, I knew the idea.
Josh and myself are doing a romantic matador stilt walker.
Imean,youcoloredit,not me.
Butifyoudon 'tput it underneath the whole dress and the jacket, then you're gonna-- it's gonna be messy.
Whatdoyoumean,messy?
Ithoughttheshapewas supposed to be kind of roundish.
Ifeelthisdirectionwe're taking is absolutely wrong.
It's not what we need to be presenting in 2011.
Whydon'tyoufinishthis , since you have the whole idea?
No,I don'thavethe whole idea.
This is a design that we're working on together.
No,I know.
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying--no, no, no.
You need to hold on.
You need to hold on.
Letmefinish.
I'llbeback.
Okay,youcomeback.
Ican'tdealwithyou.
It's like you act like a small kid, like, you--you don't let me talk.
No,' causeyou'regetting confused.
No,it'snotaquestion.
It's not a question.
It was a comment.
Okay,well,I'mmakinga statement.
Saveitforthe judge.
He's, like, so immature.
He's like a 57-year-old kid.
It's only his way or the highway.
It's kind of difficult to make sense with somebody who's crazy.
[Whistling]
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
We'reallfeelingtense.
Anyone could go down because of their teammate.
That'sveryimmature.
What'simmatureis you'renot letting me finish.
[Clearsthroat]
What was that about?
What?
What are you talking about?
[Both laugh]
I just think he kind of just gets defensive right away.
And it's unnecessary.
He'sshakingin hisboots.
He doesn't have immunity this time.
Here'stheskirt.
And I was just saying, like, since you have the idea how you're doing this-- that'sfine,butyou switched fabrics on us a couple times.
It'smostlyyourdesign.
I'm just kind of following you.
No,itisn't.
Butwecouldgoonandon and talk about-- no,I 'mjustgettingthat-- clarifying what I understood we said in the store.
Okay,so,youwanttotalk- - thatwasmy understanding.
Well, no, but it...
Bertwillfightyou on anything, even if there is nothing to fight about.
Idon'twanttodebatethat.
I just wanna do this.
MaybeI do.
That'sveryimmature.
No,it'snot.
What's immature is you're not letting me finish.
Okay,it's--letme hearyou .
That'sallI'msaying.
Youknow,Idon 'tknowwhat
Bert has in his mind.
I almost feel like he does things on purpose to sabotage me, or maybe it's a strategy.
I don't--I have no idea.
Working,working,working, working.
Thehardestpartofdesigning a garment for a stilt walker is figuring out how to make her look as chic as possible, and also to make it safe.
Yeah,butthisiswhat I'm envisioning.
Fullness, we want at the bottom.
So we need a hoop, right?
Right.
Laura and I agree on making a cage for a big hoop skirt.
Almost like an old Alabama plantation girl.
Thiswillbe an old petticoat?
Yes.
Just allow for some volume on the bottom to get that dramatic effect, but so it didn't get caught under the model's stilts.
So I'm cutting all this boning and gluing and circles.
And...
A lot of math.
[Singsong]Teamwork.
Whatdoyouthink the color should be?
Well,justsomethinghigh around the neck.
Either wrapping or, like-- we want dramatic.
Ithink,whenitcomesto group challenge, it's not about how brilliant or how amazing you can do by yourself.
It's much more about the collaboration and communication between the two people.
No,I wannado ,like,a little bullfighter jacket.
But--but the sleeves so you can hold it and be, like...
Right.
Doesthatmakesense?
And then, if you made a bustier-- but,like,doesthatmake sense?
Doesthatmakesense?
Doyouneedtopoke me?
Quit poking me.
You're like a poker and a puncher.
You're such a rough chick.
I'mthemanhere.
MeandJuliecouldbasically flop genders.
[Laughter]
Soonceyoumakethis pattern, you think you can base all the other ones off of this, right?
Yeah.
Okay,good.
A lot of teams thought that we were crazy for working with chiffon.
And, yeah, it's a little bit of a risk.
Okay.
Mostdesignersconsider chiffon difficult.
Danielle and I are very comfortable with those fabrics.
And we love how it flows and how it moves.
The thing about Becky's personality is I really can't read it.
She stares a lot.
She just stares.
So you just wonder what's going through her mind.
What?
What?
I think we're all feeling tense because anyone could go down because of their teammate.
So it's not just about one person anymore.
So it's anybody's game today.
[Sighs]
Youmakingagianttutu ?
[Chuckles]Yeah.
Awesome.
Beckysoundedscaredwhenshe said that.
"You're making a black tutu?"
You were in the bottom last time, right?
It'sprettyimportantfor me and Bryce to do well.
We were both in the bottom, and we both got paired up together.
Weneedto havesomething that is a thin line between costume and fashion.
Bryce,I justwanttolook at this real quick with you.
This bodice with that is, like, pretty blah.
And I really feel like that turquoise as a waistband would-- no.
Why?
Absolutelynot.
Whynot?
Dude,it'stoomuch.
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
This is way too much pop.
No, I am not doing the turquoise.
Okay.
Bryceistakingoverallthe control, so I'm feeling like I can't have any input because he'll probably bite my head off.
Justgetthebodicedone first, and then we'll worry about this stuff later.
Okay.
Ithinkhe trustsmewith the style that I'm doing.
Yeah.
Yeah,yeah.
WorkingwithJoshisactually surprisingly really smooth.
Wasthisateamchallenge?
[Laughs]
'CauseI 'mworkingalone.
[Laughter]
No,whereis she?
It'sfine.
It's quiet over here.
Ooh,dramaon 34thstreet.
[Laughter]
Soa couplehoursintothis challenge, Anthony's been trying to make this cage that we had a great idea for.
Thisisliterallygonnatake hours.
I mean, what do you think about that?
'Causeifyouthinkthis isn't working, we can't spend any time on it.
Thisisn'tgonnawork.
Okay.
Problemsolved.
Weneedto scratchitand move forward.
Soitmightjustlook awesome, because then we have to put the pants everywhere.
Allthelayers,yeah.
Kimberly,whatdo youthink?
I have a collar on here.
Uh...
Ithinkit 'snottoo
Star Trek-y, it's, uh--
Ithinkwe definitelyneed something here.
You know, everybody's going big and elaborate;
We gotta-- getsomesparkle.
Wegottagetsomething.
KimberlyandIare getting along fine.
But I wasn't gonna let her put gold lame on that thing.
Sorry.
Gross.
[Sighs]
Ijustwanttomake sure that...
I'm, like, cutting it on the right grain.
I feel like I am, though.
Well,youshouldbematching it, sweetheart.
Any piece of fabric, you have threads that are going this way and threads that are going this way.
So you should have your grain on your drape.
Right,yeah.
It'sreallyimportanttoline up your fabric on grain, meaning grain line that matches up with this thread.
If it doesn't, then it can skew the whole thing.
Yeah,youneedtobecareful.
'Cause it's--if it gets off grain, you're screwed.
Okay.
Ijustgotout ofschool,so it's all fresh in my head.
Did you ever go to school?
No.
Youneverwenttoschool?
Hm-mmm.
Oh.
Fallene has no training.
She is self-taught.
And I'm worried about that.
IfeellikeIhave toconfirm everything with you right now, because I'm totally lost.
No,ifit makesyou feel good, I don't mind being comforting.
Ijustcouldnot see the grain line on that fabric.
[Sighs] Oh, God.
I'm glad we have a good relationship, Bryce.
[Softly]Shedidn'tknowhow to cut it on-grain.
[Loudly]What?
Ongrain.
Sodidshe,like,take the fabric and was like, "wah!"
It'sjustadifferenceof being self-taught and going to school.
She'strying,but...
Right.
I'vebeenturningintothe boss.
Whichthenwillput alotof responsibility on your shoulders, though.
'Cause then, at the end, if it comes down to they still didn't like it, then they're like,
"Well, who led?"
It's hard.
Hello,designers!
All:
Hi,Tim.
JoshuaandJulie.
Hi,Tim.
Howareyouall ?
We'redefinitelyhelpingeach other out, and I think our styles will collide.
Collide...
Orconverge?
Both:
Converge.
Okay.
Ithinkwe 'll...
They'vecollidedalittle bit, but...
We'regonnago forthis little Spanish feel.
She'sa bullfighter?
Both:
Yes.
Ole!
Pshew!
Juliehasbeenworkingon that jacket forever.
Butit'scute.
Lookatthisbeautiful...
Wefoundthisgreatfabric.
And I think it's gonna create like a great--
Ithinkit 'ssmashing.
Smashing.
IloveJoshuaM's pants.
It reminds me of Beetlejuice.
Carryon.
Appreciateit.
CeceliaandDanielle,how are you doing?
Good.
We're doing sort of a tailored blouse with a teal chiffon with a big, huge, billowy sleeve.
Okay.
Andtheseareour fabrics.
We're using a lot of materials that we both like.
Sowhenshewalks,youknow, these sleeves will billow back.
And it's all about movement.
Yeah.
Well,it'sallaboutthe proportion of the bottom garment to the top garment.
And it just needs--needs to work.
Theproportionsareso different, we are unfamiliar with how this look will fit.
ViktorandBert.
Talk to me.
Iguesswe wantedtostart with a bodice and do something very tight.
And also, a little bit of structure, just to create the drama.
Drama'simportant.
But this isn't intended to be a costume.
No,no.
No .
GoodLord.
That thing is ghastly.
Ithinkhe wasthinkingof doing it this way, and I was thinking of doing it the other way.
Iwantedto do acontemporary look, and he was at, "Well, I really think we should do this."
And I had some other ideas, and, no, this is what we have to do.
No,that'snottrue.
Whenever I suggest, "that doesn't work;
Maybe we could do something like this," and automatically, he goes, "That's not gonna work.
This won't work."
So right now, I'm in the point where I'm just kind of trying to get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtrying-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Areyouworried?
It's nerve-racking, because this thing might fall apart.
No,no,likethis.
I mean, this is [bleep] up because I listened to you.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
I'mjustkindoftryingto get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtryingto-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
CanI tellyouwhatconcerns me about our conversation?
I don't think I've heard either of you say "We."
This has to be a "We."
Yeah.
Itneedsto be .
Yeah.
Well,earlier,he said,
"This is your design," and I said, "No, it's not."
No,I didn'tsaythat.
Youdid.
Whateveryou'regoingtodo, you need to do it now.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Wow, color.
Red.
Red.
When you said "Paris," that's the big key word, that did it for me, having that dramatic feel to it.
Theseshoulderpadsare very on trend for fall.
We'remakingtheskirtoutof this.
Then we're lining it with the charmeuse that we made these out of, so I'm-- andyoufeelyou can control this well enough?
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, if you can pull this off, I think it's a wow moment.
That'swhatwe wantto hear, right?
Yeah.
Becky and Kimberly.
Beckykindof thoughtof military, and I kind of was like punk, which the model was totally for and about.
Andshehasatattooonher collarbone.
Mm-hmm.
Andsowe wentwitha one-shoulder so we could see this great tattoo over here.
Oh.
Ijustmadethe greensleeve and now I'm gonna make one in the stripe to see which one we like better.
I'mhopingthatthisworksin the stripe.
Yeah.
You'veworkedwelltogether?
Yeah.
She makes good pants, I make good jackets.
We divide and conquer.
Great.
Thankyou.
Thanks,Tim.
IfeellikeIhave ablack cloud over me.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
How are you feeling?
I--I'mgood.
I'm-- youare?
I'mjustworriedit'sgetting too big.
Heidi said, "Go big."
I was gonna keep going.
This is my gut telling me to stop.
Youlistento yourgut , both of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatisthistextilebeing used for?
Um,sothisisgonnabethe bodice.
I liked the polka dot because I felt that it gave some color and some pop, which is me.
Rightnow,Ireallywant
Fallene to get this bodice done so that we can worry about the pants.
Okay,go.
Go ,go ,go .
Thankyou.
AnyaandOlivier.
I'd love to hear what you're doing.
Well,theideawas ,uh, because Olivier's really menswear and I do womens wear, we have this polar opposite way of working and way of seeing things.
Ithinkthismakesyoua great team.
Yeah,andso it 'sgonnahave this tight feeling of, like, things holding her.
Uh-huh.
Andthisgoingontopof this.
I'llbeblunt.
I think it's unexpected.
Timseemsalittlethrownoff by our fabric selections.
Maybe he just doesn't know how to say, "I don't like it."
[Laughs]
Bye,everybody.
All:
Bye, Tim.
Havea goodnight.
Thanks.
Youtoo.
Bertzilla.
Bertzilla,yousaid?
Yeah.
Isthatmy newname?
I'mgonnacutthissoit won't be boggy.
Yeah,yeah,cool.
Unlessyouwantthat.
No,it'scool.
Beautiful.
Timdidmentionall heheard was "I, I, I," which is true, but I am willing to just start again, like, leave that behind and enjoy the moment.
Becauseofthat,thisis taking forever.
I'm sorry.
Justgetit done.
Iwill.
IthinkBryceand Falleneare in trouble because even though they have this great, voluminous tutu that's really impressive looking, there's nothing else that they have.
And I know Fallene's having trouble getting the bodice done.
Isitalmostdone?
It'sdone,butwhatelse do we need to sew?
ThecincherthatIwasgonna have you do, it's basically here's the two pieces together.
I'm showing Julie a quick and effective way to get a ruching effect for the waistband.
Leave these two ends open and stitch this one side down.
And then you're gonna have to grab this.
Oh,yeah,yeah.
Bringitallthe way overto here, and then it's all gonna shrink into itself and it's just gonna make, like, a great cover belt.
Perfect.
I'minsuchbad shapewith this.
We don't have time.
No,golikethis,golike this.
Here.
Go just like-- no,no.
Likethis.
Imadethisis[ bleep]edup because I listened to you.
No, I really don't care about [bleep] anymore.
I'll make interfacing.
I'm sorry.
Itiswhatitis,Danielle.
Attheendofthenight ,I'm already concerned because it's a one-day challenge and chiffon takes double the time.
Hello.
[Overlapping chatter]
Thisisso weird.
Howdoyouput pantson?
Pantsfirst,thenstilts.
I'venever,like-- neverhemmedagiantbefore.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
It's like Alice in Wonderland.
Thisisafantasy.
It's not a costume, okay?
That's the word.
It's fantasy.
Howlongdo we have?
Ten minutes?
Whyareyouworried?
Well,I wantto seeitcome together.
Nowitlookslikeamess.
Yeah.
Oh,myGod.
It's gonna come out okay.
Doyouhaveabodicetofit on her?
Yeah.
Oh,good.
Holdthatand,like...
Is it?
I'll re-cut it.
I know, it's--it's looking weird.
It'soff-grain.
It'slookingweird.
[Bleep].
Okay.
Once I put the bodice onto her,
I thinking, oh, why is this all wonky?
And didn't even realize that I didn't cut it on-grain.
I just feel like I can't do simple things right now 'cause
I'm, like, so tired and on edge.
WhenFallenecutsthe bodice off-grain, it's a big deal, and you have to immediately re-cut.
I'm worried that she won't have enough time to do something like that.
I just--I don't know how this is gonna go.
Seeyoutomorrow.
Ciao.
Bye.
Itlooksokay.
Actually, this looks nice.
[Both laugh]
I'm sorry, I don't mean to snap at you, it's just there is no time for getting fancy at this point.
Oh,Bryce.
What happened to me today?
This is really bad.
Ihaveafeelingwe'regonna be in the bottom two or the bottom three.
Itjust--it'sjustreally disappointing.
I let Bryce down 'cause I just could not finish my garment, so it's...
I'm sorry.
It'sokay.
It'sreallygonnalookbad for you.
I'm so sorry.
[Sniffles]
Allright,guys,let 'smove.
[Alarm beeps]
Areyouexcitedfor today?
I'mwonderingwherewe're going.
That's the exciting part.
[Laughter]
Ithinkouroutfitlooks good.
Ithinkit looksvery,very good.
It's--it'sdefinitelywhat you and I put together.
IthinknowI'm okaywith it.
Yesterday, I was a little bit hoping for a thunderstorm.
Everyonewasintense yesterday.
Some people here, they can whip [bleep] up so fast, you know?
Like, I feel like I'm not at that level to do that.
Dothebestyou can .
Just do the best you can.
IwishIhad mysoul right now.
I feel like I'm kind of-- well,maybeyou'llfinditin the workroom today.
Maybe it's sitting under a table just waiting for you.
All right.
Later.
Let'sgo.
[Overlapping chatter]
Well,sincewe finishedon time, we can chill.
Maybegluesomeofthefabric from here?
Sure.
I'mgonnafigureout whether or not we can do, like, a tube top or something like that.
Westillhavealotofthis left.
I'mnervousaboutwhatpeople are gonna think.
The bodice is cut off-grain, so it's a mess.
We could send it down but I feel like it's too bad.
Brycedecideslastminuteto just put together a tube top, and I just let him take over at that point.
Falleneissweet.
Bryce really pushed her around a bit.
He's very sort of a bossy kid.
Oh,youchangedthe top ?
Itwasnotcut on-grain.
Oh,right.
Like,itlookedlikeitwas melting or something awful.
Ithinkthatlooks--that'll look nice.
Yeah.
Okay, we're done talking about it.
It needs to be sewn, because this jacket has taken you over
12 hours and-- itlooksgreat.
Oh,Julie.
Oh!
Oh,Julie.[Growls]
Didyou--didyou--didyou manage to stitch some of the shoulder last night?
No,itwassotighttothe mannequin.
I didn't have time to sew everything perfectly.
It's nerve-racking because I'm worried that this thing might fall apart.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Thisisgoingtobeahugely jam-packed morning.
In an hour and a half, we are leaving the workroom for our outdoor runway.
Ithasn'tbeendoneonthe show before, and to be a part of the first public runway makes me completely speechless.
IfeellikeI'm running around with my head cut off, 'cause I don't think that I'm gonna have enough time to sew up a new top.
Comingupon project runway...
Thehairlookslikea pumpkin.
Iknowwe bothdon 'tthink this is our best work.
We'reheadedto ourfirst outdoor runway ever.
I'msortof freakingout .
No,you'regonnabefine .
Idon'tthinkthere'sany making this attractive.
[Sighs]
Son of a bitch.
Bryceiscompletelystressed out, and I felt bad but after seeing what he's producing, I'm sort of freaking out.
Idon'tknow.
Maybe I should put the zip in.
Idon'tfeelthat'sright.
I don't know.
I'mjust--I'mhonestlyso frustrated right now.
I mean, I know we both don't think this is our best work.
Like,ifwe justadd ,like,a couple little-- foryourjacket.
It'smajor.
IfJoshwantstobedazzle,
I'm gonna let him do it.
[Laughs]
Wehavealot moretodo-- all the finishing work on the skirt and then attach it to the bodice.
I'm just hoping we have enough time.
IknewIwantedtocreatea headpiece, knowing that this is a team effort and I didn't create anything.
And so I got the red feathers.
I broke 'em up with some of the fabric to kind of bring something interesting to this garment.
It'sbeautiful.
It's really stunning.
ThisistheJoshside .
Andyouseweditbeautifully.
It's sewn beautifully.
With Julie, I knew it could go one of two ways--completely horrible or amazing between both of us, and I think that we're gonna do something that might shock a lot of people.
Designers,I amsendingin your models.
You will have an hour to send your models to the L'Oreal Paris makeup room and the Garnier hair studio.
The Piperlime wall, of course, is important here.
I'm being very strict about the schedule this morning because we have a curtain call, everyone.
Right.
Allright?
Thank you.
[Overlapping chatter]
Makeitjustatadbit tighter.
Josh,youwanttodomakeup?
I think you're gonna be better at that than I will.
I'llwageryouthat.
[Laughs]

I'msotired.
Oh,no.
That'snotwhattheywant .
Thanksforthat.
Thehairlookslikeahuge pumpkin on her head.
There was nothing we could do at this point because we had to walk out of there.
Designersandmodels,let 's go.
We're headed to our first outdoor runway ever and we're gonna have a blast.
I'mnotexcitedfor the runway show.
No, I'm terrified.
I'm thinking, like, that I could have made this work but instead
I just let him take over and we're in trouble.
Herewego .
[Overlapping chatter]
Where'smybigleopardbag?
Thankyou,Tim.
Ooh!
Wehavethishugeevent, bigger than actually I think any of us really thought it was going to be, and it's all taking place in battery park.
It still does not feel real.
Ihaveto saythatifIhad to have my show out in the middle of New York Harbor, I'd be a little nervous.
I'mjustoverjoyedbythis , being outdoors as well as all the press and it being the first time this has ever happened, everything is just exhilarating.
Andrightdownhere.
Behindthestageatthe runway show, it's just madness.
Backstage,I 'mpanicked.
After seeing all the fans and press and seeing my garment, I just fell apart.
I'mdisappointedthatI didn't make anything.
Butlisten,it 'sa collaboration between the two of you and you're responsible for the entire look.
We do the best we can under the conditions.
We do the best we can, all right?
IfeellikeI'm not evena designer right now.
I'm just, like, really disappointed.
Don'tbe.
No, you're gonna be fine.
Comingupon Project
Runway...
It'ssounbelievablytacky.
Itlookslikeabadcostume.
Andthenthehairiscrazy !
Westillhavetoknow , though, who is responsible for this mess.
Hi,everybody.
[Cheering]
It's been my dream to do this show once outside in front of all of our fans.
Thank you very much for coming, everybody.
[Cheering]
This is our first Project Runway live show outside, and we're very excited.
These are all of our new designers.
Welcome.
[Cheering]
Our judges--fashion designer
Michael Kors.
[Cheering]
And of course the lovely Nina
Garcia.
[Cheering]
And our guest judge today, Kim
Kardashian.
Welcome.
[Cheering]
Okay, everybody, enjoy the show.
[Cheering]
Ifeelreallyproudtobe seeing my garment on my model.
It's just a surreal moment for me, and I hope that it's the first of many to come.
Shelookslikeabedazzled
Spanish matador.
I mean, yeah, it was a little showy, but I thought it was appropriate for the event.
[Cheering]
It'sbiganddramatic,but the stilt models really freak me out.
They look like aliens or something.
Ihaveafeelingofregret that I was encumbered with
Viktor.
If I'd been by myself, my design would have been amazing in this setting, and I believe it would have been a knockout.
[Cheers and applause]
I'mexcitedbutalsoworried, because I wasn't so confident in what we had done.
Had we finished that bodice, we would have had a really cute look.
Now I'm just kind of worried about it.
I'mthinking,it 'samateur hour.
We both feel that we are gonna be on the chopping block.
I'm, like, super emotional right now.
[Cheering]
Mymodelwasalittleawkward in her walking.
It's just really strange, but she was wearing borrowed stilts.
Maybe that had something to do with it.
I'mverypleasedwithour look and I think it will go over really well.
The only think I would change is the pointed collar that Becky put on the shoulder pad.
I told her that it was too Star
Trek looking, but I think we fulfilled the challenge.
[Cheering]
Ithinkit 'saverycool garment, but if we could have speeded things up, we probably could have done a better job.
I'mpleasedthatitlooks beautiful but I really feel that this could have been super dynamic.
Regardless of how simple the dress is, it's still a pretty sight.
[Cheering]
I'mthinking,like,thisis beautiful.
The pants and the top fit perfectly, and they're flowing beautifully.
But then, when you get up to the hair, we were like, uh-oh.
Shelooksgreat.
You couldn't see any resemblance of a stilt in there, and I was afraid of that.
But I know that they are gonna hit me hard with the hairstyling.
It's just traumatic.
[Cheering]
IreallythinkthatAnthony and I have a really good chance in having the winning design.
It's chic, it's Parisian couture, just like Tim said, but yet it's got drama involved.
The charmeuse skirt is flying, the pants look beautiful and full.
It's just perfect.
I'msuperproudofjust what
Laura and I have accomplished.
Ours is definitely the wow dress.
I'm amazed at how the fabric just went.
It's just phenomenal.
[Cheers and applause]
[Applause]
Didyouenjoyshowingoff your work to a live audience today?
Verymuch.
Weexpectedto see show-stopping garments today, and we were very impressed by some of your designs, but others didn't do as well as we expected.
The winner of this challenge will receive immunity and cannot be eliminated for next week.
Olivier, you won the last challenge, so today you cannot be eliminated.
We scored your designs as they came down the runway.
One of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
Olivier, Anya, your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Anthony, Laura, Danielle,
Cecilia, Kimberly, Becky, your teams had the highest scores.
Yes.
JoshuaandJulie,Bertand
Viktor, Fallene and Bryce, your teams had the lowest scores.
We're going to talk to the team with the highest scores first and then we'll bring you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Itwasamess.
It really was a mess, I'm sorry to say this.
I feel like ours is--they're gonna say harsh things.
Well,here'sthefunnything.
If you look at it, costume, costume, costume.
Yeah.
Who'sontherunway?
Ready to wear, ready to wear, ready to wear.
Itjustfeelsveryhorrible, the wait, like somebody punched you in the stomach and threw you down on the stage.
Anthony,Laura,tellusabout your look.
Wedecidedon thecolorred.
You know, we wanted a wow.
Carla was gonna just, when she walked out, it was like, whoa.
Ilikedit alot .
I think it was dramatic enough.
I loved all those little pieces.
You know, you can always tell when designers do that, it means so much work.
I guess most people probably think it's just, like, thrown on there and glued together.
Ididnothand-sewanyof that.
It is all with a hot glue gun.
ScrapwhatIsaidbefore.
[Laughter]
Well...
Ilovedthislook.
I love that color.
I love the detailing of the little black belt.
This looked so elegant, not costumey at all.
It looks amazing.
Ireallylikethis.
I thought it was very beautiful, the way it flowed and the way the wind made it move was beautiful.
My only worry--and Anthony, we've had this on two occasions with you--is it's a little referential to me.
It looks like something that
I've seen, so please try to be original when you design.
But other than that, it is absolutely beautiful.
Ithinkthetrickiestthing to do is, if you scaled it down and she wasn't on stilts, would it still be fabulous?
And I think it would still be fabulous.
Butwhotakesmore responsibility for this gorgeous look?
Well,I toldherbeforewe got here, I was like, if we get up there, I want you to take it.
That'snice.
All right, Danielle, Cecilia, tell us about your look.
Itreflectsverymuchwhat we do.
Uh, we wanted to create elegance.
So,whodidwhatexactly?
Whenwesawthe stiltwalkers,
I instantly thought of doing a huge sleeve, so I was really married to the blouse idea and then Cecilia came up with the pants.
Ilikethislook.
I like the blouse.
I like the color combination.
I like the brown pants and I like the way you constructed them.
I like the sheerness, that you can see through.
I think that's very nice.
What ruins it for me is her head.
Thehairis crazy!
I mean, my God!
Ilovethislook.
I think this is so chic, and I love bling, and I do love that detailing, and I think the thing that stood out to me the most was just that color, I think, is so rich.
Thankyou.
Thankyou,Kim.
It'sa veryprettyoutfit.
Ithoughtyoupickeda beautiful fabric, but it's about drama, and it's too quiet.
Listen,youpickedthe trickiest fabric in the world.
I mean, chiffon, and to do it impeccably is--it takes so much time.
Wewereverycomfortable using chiffon, which everybody thought it was a bit crazy, given the restraint on time.
Mm-hmm.
Anditwasactuallyacrazy idea.
Becauseyoucandoa chiffon pant like that and make someone just look like a mess, and she doesn't.
KimberlyandBecky,tellus about your look.
Weknewinstantlywhenwegot our model that we wanted to do something edgy.
We wanted to play on each other's strengths.
So she's strong in jackets.
I like structure, so I wanted to do a tailored pant.
Iwasveryimpressedwhen I saw this outfit.
You tailored the pants and it still is a showstopper because it is so sharp, because it is almost perfect.
Thankyou.
Ithinkyouguysarekick-ass tailors.
I mean, you really cut a mean pant.
Thankyou.
Thanks.
Thankyou.
It'llmakeeverywomanwho wants to wear it want to get that tattoo.
[Laughter]
You need the tattoo.
Ilovethepants.
Oh,thankyou.
Lovethepants.
My only detail that I feel could have been edited is that half-collar.
It just looks a little circusy.
But all in all, it was one of my favorite looks too.
Thankyou.
Nowwe'regoingtotalk to the designers with the lower scores.
Thank you very much.
You can leave the runway.
Bert, Viktor, tell us about your look.
Ichosethebottompart 'cause I wanted it to be a little bit more modern and thin.
And Bert chose the top part.
We did--had our little struggles, and we did--had miscommunications and things like that.
Tome,it 'slikethe wallpaper and curtains at a really tacky catering hall.
Mm-hmm.
Ihatethatdustruffleof gold on the top of it.
It's just, it's really old.
It'salmostlikeinthemovie
The Sound of Music, when they took the drapes off and made their clothes, but like Marie
Antoinette days.
It really does look like curtains.
Ithinkit lookslikeabad costume.
It's terrible.
Idon'tbelievethatthis was what I wanted to present.
Soyouthinkit'shis responsibility.
Ididn'tcreatethis.
Okay.
Viktor, what do you think?
Iownit .
I think we both worked at it at the end and we finished it and--
Sowhenyousay ,"Iownit,"
it means that it was your idea.
Imean,Iown the workwith him because we both did very much 50-50.
"Iownit "?
50-50 is not "I own it."
No,like,no ,notown it.
I guess I'm being responsible for it.
Sothatmeansifthis outfit today is the worst look, you would be the one to go home?
Oh,no.
[Laughs]
No, no.
Well,then,that'snot owning it.
Bert,you'returningslightly lobster color.
Oh,amI?
Sorry.
He was very emphatic about, "I want to do this, we need to do a
Victorian," and I found it unusual that he wouldn't sketch.
He said, "Well, you sketch it.
You sketch better."
Whywouldyounot sketch something?
No,I-I--no,Idid sketch.
No,youtoldme, "Bert,you sketch, you sketch."
It'sinmy HP computer.
Itseemslikeyou two had a lovely day yesterday.
Yes.
Allright,fromone strange look to the next, Fallene and
Bryce, tell us about your outfit.
Ihadtheidea,becausewe were working with such long legs, that we could do a really, really big, kind of full tulle skirt and then we were gonna have cute little details up on the top.
Butliterally,yougavehera
Black Swan.
Yeah.
Idon'tgetit.
Thishasno effortput into it.
It does look like just a tank top that I wear to bed and it looks like a tie wrapped around the waist a couple times.
This just looks like you could have done this in 15 minutes.
Youknow,Ithinktheidea had so much promise.
However, there's nothing.
There's no detail.
It's just the beginning of something.
It's--it's--likeyousaid, it's, like, half done.
Soit'slikenonedone ,then .
Yeah.
Iloveherheadpiece.
I think the headpiece is nice.
Well,I 'msogladImade something.
Ithinktheheadpieceis great.
Listen, to me, it's like she's got every dance reference and it ends up just looking like nothing because they don't meld.
SoBryce,if thiswas the worst look, who do you think should go home?
Um,I thinkbothofus.
I think that--I think this was a team effort.
Unfortunately,itwouldbe only one.
IthinkIshouldbeableto stay.
I did my best.
Iwouldsaymyself.
IwouldsayFallene.
Josh,Julie,tellusabout your look.
Well,I cameup withthe concepts.
Andtheconceptwas circus?
No,itwasmatador.
Ole,ole,ole!
I mean, guys, you know, drama doesn't mean tacky.
Spanishmatador,youcan be inspired by that, you know, and that could be really chic.
You know, we've seen it.
Ijustthinkit'syetanother
Halloween costume.
It's the weirdest hybrid I've ever heard of.
Andshe'sgotthesetiny arms and these extremely long legs.
[Laughter]
It gives her a very bizarre-- when she walked out, I was like, huh.
Forget the matador, circus, and all that.
Theonlypositivethingthat
I could say about this outfit is, it looks well made.
Iagree.
Imean,it is sharp.
That it is, definitely.
So if we decide that this is the worst look for today, who should go home?
Well,itwasmyidea ,andI 'm not gonna throw Josh under the bus.
Whatdoyouthink,Josh ?
Iwouldhopenot togohome, and I would not choose myself.
Soyou'resayingyou would choose Julie.
Yes,I wouldchooseJulie.
Okay,sowe 'veheardwhat you had to say.
We're gonna have a little chat and then I'll call you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Thankyou.
Let'stalkaboutthe designs and the designers that we did like today.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Thegarmentreallylooked modern, dramatic, exciting.
Well,itwasthe rightchoice of color, it was the right way to do the pants, and it still looks like a gown.
Ithoughtit wasbeautifulon the model wearing stilts, and I could picture it on a woman without the stilts.
Thatwaspretty.
Then we have Danielle and
Cecilia.
Ihappenedto likethat outfit.
I think it's just really chic.
Andthebeadingwas beautiful.
Theplushereistotakethat chiffon and make something that is finished beautifully.
The chiffon, if you make a mistake, she's in a rag.
DanielleandCecilia,they both know how to sew.
Oh,yeah.
Theydo.
Yousawit here.
BeckyandKimberly.
Thesimpletruthis, they sent out something impeccably tailored.
The pants were fantastic.
Andtheproportionswere right.
Yes.
Italsodidn'tlooklike two designers did something and they stuck it together.
Butrealistically,theyhad a very cohesive look.
Yeah,I thoughtthatit looked like it was done by one person.
Metoo.
Let'stalkaboutthe designers that we didn't like.
Even though it was Julie's idea to make this circus matador outfit, I can still see Josh's bedazzling in there.
They'reanoddteam,when you think about Julie and Josh.
Julie is, you know, rocky, you know, mountain woman, and Josh is like, bedazzle it, glamorous, and kind of those two things together ended up with this insane, very tacky matador outfit.
Yeah.
Youareadesigner.
You're selling design, you're selling taste.
Imean,therewas likeso many details, you didn't know where to look.
It was crazy.
Bryce and Fallene.
Yougetto theBlackSwan /Bob
Fosse combo.
I mean, the hat was the only thing that had any bit of charm or, I don't know, personality.
Itlookedliketwo different eras.
It was like showgirl hat, ballerina--I--you know, it didn't go together at all.
Yeah.
Dance hall girl, modern dance, and ballet, all combined.
What if they hadn't had-- aninspiration.
There was nothing.
It was a promise of an idea, but they couldn't deliver anything.
I mean, I'm not defending Bryce, but I think at least he's got a little more spunk.
Buttheonlythingthat we did like was the hat, and she made the hat.
Ifthehatwasn'tthere,you really would have fallen asleep.
ViktortotallythrewBert under the bus.
He didn't really say it, but he did.
Well,BertthrewViktorunder the bus too.
IjustthinkthatViktoris full of it, and he just--
Idotoo.
Youknow,IbelieveBert when he says he didn't do a drawing and all of that stuff.
Shouldn'tBerthavesaid,
"You know what?
I think this thing is not working."
It's ugly drapes.
I mean, they're ugly drapes.
Awfulfabric.
Everythingbadin thehouse on your body.
Sowe'vemadeour decision?
Okay, let's bring them back out.
Your teams represent the highest and the lowest scores.
One designer will be the winner of this challenge and one designer will be out.
AnthonyRyanandLaura,you two did a great job.
Laura, congratulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
[Applause]
That means that you have immunity next time.
Anthony Ryan, we think that you also did a great job.
Laura and Anthony Ryan, you can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
Winningisawesome,but it's also wonderful winning with such a great partner that was so gracious.
Oh!
I knewit .
[Applause]
So who won?
Idid.
Oh!
Congratulations.
Thankyou.
I'm gonna win the next one too.
[Laughs]

You can leave the runway.
Both:
Thankyou.
Josh,Julie,you'rein.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyouverymuch.
Thank you.
Bert,Viktor,youhaveto remember that dramatic does not mean costumey.
Your fabric choice was so very wrong that almost anything that you would have done with it would have been bad.
Bert, you're in.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
BryceandFallene,yourlook was boring ballerina.
It looked like there was no effort put into it.
Bryce, you're in.
You can leave the runway.

Iwasn'treadyfor Joshto go.
He has so much talent, and there's people like Fallene that don't even know really what their direction is at this point.
She talks to much about being a hairstylist, I'm not even sure if she's a designer, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Oh,man.
I'm just freakin' nervous for today.
I'm like, maybe I'm too much of a normal person.
I never thought I would be normal, but...

He is just saying the wrong things at the wrong time.
It annoys me.

"Oh, gee, look who I'm stuck with."
I don't appreciate it, and I don't think it's professional.

There'sa bigbull's-eyeon the two of us.
Forthefirsttimeever on
Project Runway, your fashion show will take place outside, in front of a live audience and the press.
Whoa.
I got goosebumps.
Just the bigness of it is very, very exciting to me.
Soyourjobistomakesure that your look will stand out...
But be in at the same time.
Good luck, everybody.
And we all will see you on the outdoor runway.
Let's go, girls.
Bye, guys!
All:

Okay.
Whoo!
Ireallylikecolor.
And I really like pattern.
Ithinkof crazythings sometimes.
You know, obviously, sometimes-- no,yeah,keepgoing.
Youknow?
Talktome ,becauseifyou talk and I can draw-- butsometimes,we canhave them like they're coming out of something, you know?
Right.
Iwasthinkingmorelike old
Hollywood.
Something more classic, so...
MaeWest?
Yeah,like,evenMae West.
Exactly.
Like it's a--it's-- you can make it have pants.
MaeWestneverworepants.
Her entire life.
No, she didn't.
She wore skirts.
Bertistoodefensive.
He needs to calm down.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Howexcitedareyou about this challenge?
It's completely thrilling.
I want you to think about a couple of things.
Think about Paris Couture Week.
It causes you to question what's real and what isn't.
Very much like this challenge.
I'm always looking at fashion illustrations, which I happen to love, but I always say, "These aren't real women."
Well, for this challenge, they are.
Everyonealwayssaysthat when I draw my fashion figures, they're so, like, long.
It's kind of like our fashion illustrations get to come to life.
It's a pretty exciting challenge, I think, for all the designers.
Iambringinginyour stilt walker models.
You will have 30 minutes to consult with them as a team.
We're going shopping at Mood, and each team will have a budget of $500.
Whoo!
Andyouhaveone day for this challenge.
So it's today.
Noway.
Way.
Areyoucrazy?
SoI 'msendingin your models.
Have fun!
Doesithavetobepants ?
Iwouldimagine.
Probably.
Sothatyoucan-- thedresswouldget tangled.
Yeah,yeah.
That'd be a disaster.
Oh,great,Ihavenevereven talked to her.
She's never really talked to me.
But we agreed on kind of a look and a style, and realized, "Oh, she makes great pants."
And I make great tailored jackets, so...
That's what we're doing.
Yes.
Hey,ladies.
Over here.
Hi,howareyou ?
Sithere.
Okay.
Icancrouchall the way down to, like...
Like that, or-- whataboutsleeves?
Does that bother you?
Howisit ,walkingin something...
Long and full?
Itisimportantthatit's not below where my feet fasten into my stilts.
Whereyourstiltis.
Becauseitcausesyou to tumble.
Ourinspirationforthis design, we're thinking Parisian couture.
Just a really flattering silhouette, and not make her look like she's in the circus, walking down a runway.
Theway--I'mthinkingdrapey.
Okay,realdrapey.
Okay.
I'mthinkinglikethis.
Butthinkcircus-ytoo .
Oh,I--Iam .
Like, think about it moving back behind her.
Like, it's gonna be like flowing and moving.
So Fallene and I know that we want to do a big, full skirt.
And we're inspired by our model.
She has been a ballerina forever.
She's got tattoos, funky hair.
We definitely want to go with this kind of dark ballerina.
KindoflikeQueenVictoriaa little bit, like, just...
Oh,that'sverygood.
Alittlebitbig here.
Nice, big, like, open here.
But maybe a big collar.
But it's sexy here.
Uh-huh.
QueenVictoriawasin mourning for 50 years.
I don't think that's a sexy direction I would like to go into.
Ifyoudo adressthat 'slike a bust like here, her boobs are gonna be showing like this.
That'snotVictorian.
That's Elizabethan.
Well,whatever.
Well,there'sadifference.
Bertisaknow-it-all.
He's just very obnoxious.
Viktorreallyneedstodoa little bit of book reading.
Designers...
Say good-bye to your models.
They will be back later today for a fitting.
Bye!
Thankyou,ladies.
All right, let's head out to our first trip to Mood.
So follow me.
Design teams, here we go.
Your 30 minutes begins...
Right now.
Alittlebithere,here , here, and more here, and then boom.
Viktor.
Bert,darling.
Whereareyou?
Whereareyou?
Backhere.
Look.
Follow my voice.
Iwantto to ,like,akimono with this, and then have big sleeves, and not go-- sobigsleevesmeancouture?
I literally had to bite my tongue.
How much training do you have in couture?
What'sthis?
Ourgameplanistojustpull every red shade that we like.
We have our grocery list.
So it's just a matter of executing it.
Yeah,I likethispattern better.
Butasfarasthat ,Ifeel like it should be more modern.
Areyoutwoall right?
Yes,we'regreat.
Okay.
You're kind of a dream team.
So...
We'rehavingagoodtime .
Wehavehighexpectations.
Iwaslookingforwardtoa team challenge, and to have one with Oliver, it is a dream.
Canthisbe pleated?
Ugh.
Julie,anythingin lifecan be pleated.
She was rockin' my nerves.
Ooh,I likethetextureof this.
Chiffon is the lightest of all the fabrics you can grab.
It's like this...
Of silk.
So I think it'd be cool to do something that's almost a muted, like, really muted polka dot.
This is way too -- insteadofthedenim?
Yeah.
Okay,gofindit.
I'mnotsettlingfor all black.
We're not creating a freakin' gothic...stilt walker.
Youhavetwominutes remaining.
Oh!
Okay.
Soweneedtohurryup.
Yes,weneedtohurryup.
Thankyou.
Thereisnothinglikeit,so
I'm just grabbing anything.
Geta lotof it .
Allright,designers.
Time is up.
Design teams at the register.
Anya, you're walking the wrong way.
So let's head back to Parsons.
Thank you, Mood!
All:
Thankyou!
Hey.
Yeah,let'snotfocussomuch on this.
Well,that'spartofthe dress.
I'mnotsayingwe're building a-- no,I 'mnotdisagreeingwith anything you're saying, though.
Ijustwanttomake sure we know what we're going as far as units.
We've agreed on the silhouette.
It's going to be a strapless bustier piece, and then there'll be this full skirt.
MayI haveyourattention, just for a moment?
You have until 9:00 tonight.
All right, work hard.
I will see you later.
Thank you.
Doyoufeelcomfortable making very well-fitting pants?
I'mcomfortablewithpattern making, so...
Okay,foryour...
Otherlooks, were you happy with the fit?
Lady,I makecustom-made clothing for people with all kind of bodies.
I know how to fit pants.
YouknowthatIwantedthe other prints, right?
Like a more modern print.
They might say it might be dated, 'cause it's a little bit too flowery.
It's gonna be definitely a challenge to work with that ugly fabric.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
Ithinkthisfabricis genius.
Assoonas he foundthe fabric, I knew the idea.
Josh and myself are doing a romantic matador stilt walker.
Imean,youcoloredit,not me.
Butifyoudon 'tput it underneath the whole dress and the jacket, then you're gonna-- it's gonna be messy.
Whatdoyoumean,messy?
Ithoughttheshapewas supposed to be kind of roundish.
Ifeelthisdirectionwe're taking is absolutely wrong.
It's not what we need to be presenting in 2011.
Whydon'tyoufinishthis , since you have the whole idea?
No,I don'thavethe whole idea.
This is a design that we're working on together.
No,I know.
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying--no, no, no.
You need to hold on.
You need to hold on.
Letmefinish.
I'llbeback.
Okay,youcomeback.
Ican'tdealwithyou.
It's like you act like a small kid, like, you--you don't let me talk.
No,' causeyou'regetting confused.
No,it'snotaquestion.
It's not a question.
It was a comment.
Okay,well,I'mmakinga statement.
Saveitforthe judge.
He's, like, so immature.
He's like a 57-year-old kid.
It's only his way or the highway.
It's kind of difficult to make sense with somebody who's crazy.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
We'reallfeelingtense.
Anyone could go down because of their teammate.
That'sveryimmature.
What'simmatureis you'renot letting me finish.
What was that about?
What?
What are you talking about?
I just think he kind of just gets defensive right away.
And it's unnecessary.
He'sshakingin hisboots.
He doesn't have immunity this time.
Here'stheskirt.
And I was just saying, like, since you have the idea how you're doing this-- that'sfine,butyou switched fabrics on us a couple times.
It'smostlyyourdesign.
I'm just kind of following you.
No,itisn't.
Butwecouldgoonandon and talk about-- no,I 'mjustgettingthat-- clarifying what I understood we said in the store.
Okay,so,youwanttotalk- - thatwasmy understanding.
Well, no, but it...
Bertwillfightyou on anything, even if there is nothing to fight about.
Idon'twanttodebatethat.
I just wanna do this.
MaybeI do.
That'sveryimmature.
No,it'snot.
What's immature is you're not letting me finish.
Okay,it's--letme hearyou .
That'sallI'msaying.
Youknow,Idon 'tknowwhat
Bert has in his mind.
I almost feel like he does things on purpose to sabotage me, or maybe it's a strategy.
I don't--I have no idea.
Working,working,working, working.
Thehardestpartofdesigning a garment for a stilt walker is figuring out how to make her look as chic as possible, and also to make it safe.
Yeah,butthisiswhat I'm envisioning.
Fullness, we want at the bottom.
So we need a hoop, right?
Right.
Laura and I agree on making a cage for a big hoop skirt.
Almost like an old Alabama plantation girl.
Thiswillbe an old petticoat?
Yes.
Just allow for some volume on the bottom to get that dramatic effect, but so it didn't get caught under the model's stilts.
So I'm cutting all this boning and gluing and circles.
And...
A lot of math.
Teamwork.
Whatdoyouthink the color should be?
Well,justsomethinghigh around the neck.
Either wrapping or, like-- we want dramatic.
Ithink,whenitcomesto group challenge, it's not about how brilliant or how amazing you can do by yourself.
It's much more about the collaboration and communication between the two people.
No,I wannado ,like,a little bullfighter jacket.
But--but the sleeves so you can hold it and be, like...
Right.
Doesthatmakesense?
And then, if you made a bustier-- but,like,doesthatmake sense?
Doesthatmakesense?
Doyouneedtopoke me?
Quit poking me.
You're like a poker and a puncher.
You're such a rough chick.
I'mthemanhere.
MeandJuliecouldbasically flop genders.
Soonceyoumakethis pattern, you think you can base all the other ones off of this, right?
Yeah.
Okay,good.
A lot of teams thought that we were crazy for working with chiffon.
And, yeah, it's a little bit of a risk.
Okay.
Mostdesignersconsider chiffon difficult.
Danielle and I are very comfortable with those fabrics.
And we love how it flows and how it moves.
The thing about Becky's personality is I really can't read it.
She stares a lot.
She just stares.
So you just wonder what's going through her mind.
What?
What?
I think we're all feeling tense because anyone could go down because of their teammate.
So it's not just about one person anymore.
So it's anybody's game today.
Youmakingagianttutu ?
Yeah.
Awesome.
Beckysoundedscaredwhenshe said that.
"You're making a black tutu?"
You were in the bottom last time, right?
It'sprettyimportantfor me and Bryce to do well.
We were both in the bottom, and we both got paired up together.
Weneedto havesomething that is a thin line between costume and fashion.
Bryce,I justwanttolook at this real quick with you.
This bodice with that is, like, pretty blah.
And I really feel like that turquoise as a waistband would-- no.
Why?
Absolutelynot.
Whynot?
Dude,it'stoomuch.
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
This is way too much pop.
No, I am not doing the turquoise.
Okay.
Bryceistakingoverallthe control, so I'm feeling like I can't have any input because he'll probably bite my head off.
Justgetthebodicedone first, and then we'll worry about this stuff later.
Okay.
Ithinkhe trustsmewith the style that I'm doing.
Yeah.
Yeah,yeah.
WorkingwithJoshisactually surprisingly really smooth.
Wasthisateamchallenge?
'CauseI 'mworkingalone.
No,whereis she?
It'sfine.
It's quiet over here.
Ooh,dramaon 34thstreet.
Soa couplehoursintothis challenge, Anthony's been trying to make this cage that we had a great idea for.
Thisisliterallygonnatake hours.
I mean, what do you think about that?
'Causeifyouthinkthis isn't working, we can't spend any time on it.
Thisisn'tgonnawork.
Okay.
Problemsolved.
Weneedto scratchitand move forward.
Soitmightjustlook awesome, because then we have to put the pants everywhere.
Allthelayers,yeah.
Kimberly,whatdo youthink?
I have a collar on here.
Uh...
Ithinkit 'snottoo
Star Trek-y, it's, uh--
Ithinkwe definitelyneed something here.
You know, everybody's going big and elaborate;
We gotta-- getsomesparkle.
Wegottagetsomething.
KimberlyandIare getting along fine.
But I wasn't gonna let her put gold lame on that thing.
Sorry.
Gross.
Ijustwanttomake sure that...
I'm, like, cutting it on the right grain.
I feel like I am, though.
Well,youshouldbematching it, sweetheart.
Any piece of fabric, you have threads that are going this way and threads that are going this way.
So you should have your grain on your drape.
Right,yeah.
It'sreallyimportanttoline up your fabric on grain, meaning grain line that matches up with this thread.
If it doesn't, then it can skew the whole thing.
Yeah,youneedtobecareful.
'Cause it's--if it gets off grain, you're screwed.
Okay.
Ijustgotout ofschool,so it's all fresh in my head.
Did you ever go to school?
No.
Youneverwenttoschool?
Hm-mmm.
Oh.
Fallene has no training.
She is self-taught.
And I'm worried about that.
IfeellikeIhave toconfirm everything with you right now, because I'm totally lost.
No,ifit makesyou feel good, I don't mind being comforting.
Ijustcouldnot see the grain line on that fabric.
Oh, God.
I'm glad we have a good relationship, Bryce.
Shedidn'tknowhow to cut it on-grain.
What?
Ongrain.
Sodidshe,like,take the fabric and was like, "wah!"
It'sjustadifferenceof being self-taught and going to school.
She'strying,but...
Right.
I'vebeenturningintothe boss.
Whichthenwillput alotof responsibility on your shoulders, though.
'Cause then, at the end, if it comes down to they still didn't like it, then they're like,
"Well, who led?"
It's hard.
Hello,designers!
All:
Hi,Tim.
JoshuaandJulie.
Hi,Tim.
Howareyouall ?
We'redefinitelyhelpingeach other out, and I think our styles will collide.
Collide...
Orconverge?
Both:
Converge.
Okay.
Ithinkwe 'll...
They'vecollidedalittle bit, but...
We'regonnago forthis little Spanish feel.
She'sa bullfighter?
Both:
Yes.
Ole!
Pshew!
Juliehasbeenworkingon that jacket forever.
Butit'scute.
Lookatthisbeautiful...
Wefoundthisgreatfabric.
And I think it's gonna create like a great--
Ithinkit 'ssmashing.
Smashing.
IloveJoshuaM's pants.
It reminds me of Beetlejuice.
Carryon.
Appreciateit.
CeceliaandDanielle,how are you doing?
Good.
We're doing sort of a tailored blouse with a teal chiffon with a big, huge, billowy sleeve.
Okay.
Andtheseareour fabrics.
We're using a lot of materials that we both like.
Sowhenshewalks,youknow, these sleeves will billow back.
And it's all about movement.
Yeah.
Well,it'sallaboutthe proportion of the bottom garment to the top garment.
And it just needs--needs to work.
Theproportionsareso different, we are unfamiliar with how this look will fit.
ViktorandBert.
Talk to me.
Iguesswe wantedtostart with a bodice and do something very tight.
And also, a little bit of structure, just to create the drama.
Drama'simportant.
But this isn't intended to be a costume.
No,no.
No .
GoodLord.
That thing is ghastly.
Ithinkhe wasthinkingof doing it this way, and I was thinking of doing it the other way.
Iwantedto do acontemporary look, and he was at, "Well, I really think we should do this."
And I had some other ideas, and, no, this is what we have to do.
No,that'snottrue.
Whenever I suggest, "that doesn't work;
Maybe we could do something like this," and automatically, he goes, "That's not gonna work.
This won't work."
So right now, I'm in the point where I'm just kind of trying to get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtrying-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Areyouworried?
It's nerve-racking, because this thing might fall apart.
No,no,likethis.
I mean, this is up because I listened to you.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
I'mjustkindoftryingto get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtryingto-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
CanI tellyouwhatconcerns me about our conversation?
I don't think I've heard either of you say "We."
This has to be a "We."
Yeah.
Itneedsto be .
Yeah.
Well,earlier,he said,
"This is your design," and I said, "No, it's not."
No,I didn'tsaythat.
Youdid.
Whateveryou'regoingtodo, you need to do it now.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Wow, color.
Red.
Red.
When you said "Paris," that's the big key word, that did it for me, having that dramatic feel to it.
Theseshoulderpadsare very on trend for fall.
We'remakingtheskirtoutof this.
Then we're lining it with the charmeuse that we made these out of, so I'm-- andyoufeelyou can control this well enough?
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, if you can pull this off, I think it's a wow moment.
That'swhatwe wantto hear, right?
Yeah.
Becky and Kimberly.
Beckykindof thoughtof military, and I kind of was like punk, which the model was totally for and about.
Andshehasatattooonher collarbone.
Mm-hmm.
Andsowe wentwitha one-shoulder so we could see this great tattoo over here.
Oh.
Ijustmadethe greensleeve and now I'm gonna make one in the stripe to see which one we like better.
I'mhopingthatthisworksin the stripe.
Yeah.
You'veworkedwelltogether?
Yeah.
She makes good pants, I make good jackets.
We divide and conquer.
Great.
Thankyou.
Thanks,Tim.
IfeellikeIhave ablack cloud over me.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
How are you feeling?
I--I'mgood.
I'm-- youare?
I'mjustworriedit'sgetting too big.
Heidi said, "Go big."
I was gonna keep going.
This is my gut telling me to stop.
Youlistento yourgut , both of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatisthistextilebeing used for?
Um,sothisisgonnabethe bodice.
I liked the polka dot because I felt that it gave some color and some pop, which is me.
Rightnow,Ireallywant
Fallene to get this bodice done so that we can worry about the pants.
Okay,go.
Go ,go ,go .
Thankyou.
AnyaandOlivier.
I'd love to hear what you're doing.
Well,theideawas ,uh, because Olivier's really menswear and I do womens wear, we have this polar opposite way of working and way of seeing things.
Ithinkthismakesyoua great team.
Yeah,andso it 'sgonnahave this tight feeling of, like, things holding her.
Uh-huh.
Andthisgoingontopof this.
I'llbeblunt.
I think it's unexpected.
Timseemsalittlethrownoff by our fabric selections.
Maybe he just doesn't know how to say, "I don't like it."
Bye,everybody.
Bye, Tim.
Havea goodnight.
Thanks.
Youtoo.
Bertzilla.
Bertzilla,yousaid?
Yeah.
Isthatmy newname?
I'mgonnacutthissoit won't be boggy.
Yeah,yeah,cool.
Unlessyouwantthat.
No,it'scool.
Beautiful.
Timdidmentionall heheard was "I, I, I," which is true, but I am willing to just start again, like, leave that behind and enjoy the moment.
Becauseofthat,thisis taking forever.
I'm sorry.
Justgetit done.
Iwill.
IthinkBryceand Falleneare in trouble because even though they have this great, voluminous tutu that's really impressive looking, there's nothing else that they have.
And I know Fallene's having trouble getting the bodice done.
Isitalmostdone?
It'sdone,butwhatelse do we need to sew?
ThecincherthatIwasgonna have you do, it's basically here's the two pieces together.
I'm showing Julie a quick and effective way to get a ruching effect for the waistband.
Leave these two ends open and stitch this one side down.
And then you're gonna have to grab this.
Oh,yeah,yeah.
Bringitallthe way overto here, and then it's all gonna shrink into itself and it's just gonna make, like, a great cover belt.
Perfect.
I'minsuchbad shapewith this.
We don't have time.
No,golikethis,golike this.
Here.
Go just like-- no,no.
Likethis.
Imadethisisedup because I listened to you.
No, I really don't care about anymore.
I'll make interfacing.
I'm sorry.
Itiswhatitis,Danielle.
Attheendofthenight ,I'm already concerned because it's a one-day challenge and chiffon takes double the time.
Hello.
Thisisso weird.
Howdoyouput pantson?
Pantsfirst,thenstilts.
I'venever,like-- neverhemmedagiantbefore.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
It's like Alice in Wonderland.
Thisisafantasy.
It's not a costume, okay?
That's the word.
It's fantasy.
Howlongdo we have?
Ten minutes?
Whyareyouworried?
Well,I wantto seeitcome together.
Nowitlookslikeamess.
Yeah.
Oh,myGod.
It's gonna come out okay.
Doyouhaveabodicetofit on her?
Yeah.
Oh,good.
Holdthatand,like...
Is it?
I'll re-cut it.
I know, it's--it's looking weird.
It'soff-grain.
It'slookingweird.
.
Okay.
Once I put the bodice onto her,
I thinking, oh, why is this all wonky?
And didn't even realize that I didn't cut it on-grain.
I just feel like I can't do simple things right now 'cause
I'm, like, so tired and on edge.
WhenFallenecutsthe bodice off-grain, it's a big deal, and you have to immediately re-cut.
I'm worried that she won't have enough time to do something like that.
I just--I don't know how this is gonna go.
Seeyoutomorrow.
Ciao.
Bye.
Itlooksokay.
Actually, this looks nice.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to snap at you, it's just there is no time for getting fancy at this point.
Oh,Bryce.
What happened to me today?
This is really bad.
Ihaveafeelingwe'regonna be in the bottom two or the bottom three.
Itjust--it'sjustreally disappointing.
I let Bryce down 'cause I just could not finish my garment, so it's...
I'm sorry.
It'sokay.
It'sreallygonnalookbad for you.
I'm so sorry.
Allright,guys,let 'smove.
Areyouexcitedfor today?
I'mwonderingwherewe're going.
That's the exciting part.
Ithinkouroutfitlooks good.
Ithinkit looksvery,very good.
It's--it'sdefinitelywhat you and I put together.
IthinknowI'm okaywith it.
Yesterday, I was a little bit hoping for a thunderstorm.
Everyonewasintense yesterday.
Some people here, they can whip up so fast, you know?
Like, I feel like I'm not at that level to do that.
Dothebestyou can .
Just do the best you can.
IwishIhad mysoul right now.
I feel like I'm kind of-- well,maybeyou'llfinditin the workroom today.
Maybe it's sitting under a table just waiting for you.
All right.
Later.
Let'sgo.
Well,sincewe finishedon time, we can chill.
Maybegluesomeofthefabric from here?
Sure.
I'mgonnafigureout whether or not we can do, like, a tube top or something like that.
Westillhavealotofthis left.
I'mnervousaboutwhatpeople are gonna think.
The bodice is cut off-grain, so it's a mess.
We could send it down but I feel like it's too bad.
Brycedecideslastminuteto just put together a tube top, and I just let him take over at that point.
Falleneissweet.
Bryce really pushed her around a bit.
He's very sort of a bossy kid.
Oh,youchangedthe top ?
Itwasnotcut on-grain.
Oh,right.
Like,itlookedlikeitwas melting or something awful.
Ithinkthatlooks--that'll look nice.
Yeah.
Okay, we're done talking about it.
It needs to be sewn, because this jacket has taken you over
12 hours and-- itlooksgreat.
Oh,Julie.
Oh!
Oh,Julie.
Didyou--didyou--didyou manage to stitch some of the shoulder last night?
No,itwassotighttothe mannequin.
I didn't have time to sew everything perfectly.
It's nerve-racking because I'm worried that this thing might fall apart.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Thisisgoingtobeahugely jam-packed morning.
In an hour and a half, we are leaving the workroom for our outdoor runway.
Ithasn'tbeendoneonthe show before, and to be a part of the first public runway makes me completely speechless.
IfeellikeI'm running around with my head cut off, 'cause I don't think that I'm gonna have enough time to sew up a new top.
Comingupon project runway...
Thehairlookslikea pumpkin.
Iknowwe bothdon 'tthink this is our best work.
We'reheadedto ourfirst outdoor runway ever.
I'msortof freakingout .
No,you'regonnabefine .
Idon'tthinkthere'sany making this attractive.
Son of a bitch.
Bryceiscompletelystressed out, and I felt bad but after seeing what he's producing, I'm sort of freaking out.
Idon'tknow.
Maybe I should put the zip in.
Idon'tfeelthat'sright.
I don't know.
I'mjust--I'mhonestlyso frustrated right now.
I mean, I know we both don't think this is our best work.
Like,ifwe justadd ,like,a couple little-- foryourjacket.
It'smajor.
IfJoshwantstobedazzle,
I'm gonna let him do it.
Wehavealot moretodo-- all the finishing work on the skirt and then attach it to the bodice.
I'm just hoping we have enough time.
IknewIwantedtocreatea headpiece, knowing that this is a team effort and I didn't create anything.
And so I got the red feathers.
I broke 'em up with some of the fabric to kind of bring something interesting to this garment.
It'sbeautiful.
It's really stunning.
ThisistheJoshside .
Andyouseweditbeautifully.
It's sewn beautifully.
With Julie, I knew it could go one of two ways--completely horrible or amazing between both of us, and I think that we're gonna do something that might shock a lot of people.
Designers,I amsendingin your models.
You will have an hour to send your models to the L'Oreal Paris makeup room and the Garnier hair studio.
The Piperlime wall, of course, is important here.
I'm being very strict about the schedule this morning because we have a curtain call, everyone.
Right.
Allright?
Thank you.
Makeitjustatadbit tighter.
Josh,youwanttodomakeup?
I think you're gonna be better at that than I will.
I'llwageryouthat.

I don't want it to look Asian, though.
We'renotgoingtokabuki.

'Cause there's a whole bunch of royalty.

So very dramatic.
Do you think you've got it?
It'skindof vague,but we'll--we'll kind of work with it.
I'msotired.
Oh,no.
That'snotwhattheywant .
Thanksforthat.
Thehairlookslikeahuge pumpkin on her head.
There was nothing we could do at this point because we had to walk out of there.
Designersandmodels,let 's go.
We're headed to our first outdoor runway ever and we're gonna have a blast.
I'mnotexcitedfor the runway show.
No, I'm terrified.
I'm thinking, like, that I could have made this work but instead
I just let him take over and we're in trouble.
Herewego .
Where'smybigleopardbag?
Thankyou,Tim.
Ooh!
Wehavethishugeevent, bigger than actually I think any of us really thought it was going to be, and it's all taking place in battery park.
It still does not feel real.
Ihaveto saythatifIhad to have my show out in the middle of New York Harbor, I'd be a little nervous.
I'mjustoverjoyedbythis , being outdoors as well as all the press and it being the first time this has ever happened, everything is just exhilarating.
Andrightdownhere.
Behindthestageatthe runway show, it's just madness.
Backstage,I 'mpanicked.
After seeing all the fans and press and seeing my garment, I just fell apart.
I'mdisappointedthatI didn't make anything.
Butlisten,it 'sa collaboration between the two of you and you're responsible for the entire look.
We do the best we can under the conditions.
We do the best we can, all right?
IfeellikeI'm not evena designer right now.
I'm just, like, really disappointed.
Don'tbe.
No, you're gonna be fine.
Comingupon Project
Runway...
It'ssounbelievablytacky.
Itlookslikeabadcostume.
Andthenthehairiscrazy !
Westillhavetoknow , though, who is responsible for this mess.
Hi,everybody.
It's been my dream to do this show once outside in front of all of our fans.
Thank you very much for coming, everybody.
This is our first Project Runway live show outside, and we're very excited.
These are all of our new designers.
Welcome.
Our judges--fashion designer
Michael Kors.
And of course the lovely Nina
Garcia.
And our guest judge today, Kim
Kardashian.
Welcome.
Okay, everybody, enjoy the show.
Ifeelreallyproudtobe seeing my garment on my model.
It's just a surreal moment for me, and I hope that it's the first of many to come.
Shelookslikeabedazzled
Spanish matador.
I mean, yeah, it was a little showy, but I thought it was appropriate for the event.
It'sbiganddramatic,but the stilt models really freak me out.
They look like aliens or something.
Ihaveafeelingofregret that I was encumbered with
Viktor.
If I'd been by myself, my design would have been amazing in this setting, and I believe it would have been a knockout.
I'mexcitedbutalsoworried, because I wasn't so confident in what we had done.
Had we finished that bodice, we would have had a really cute look.
Now I'm just kind of worried about it.
I'mthinking,it 'samateur hour.
We both feel that we are gonna be on the chopping block.
I'm, like, super emotional right now.
Mymodelwasalittleawkward in her walking.
It's just really strange, but she was wearing borrowed stilts.
Maybe that had something to do with it.
I'mverypleasedwithour look and I think it will go over really well.
The only think I would change is the pointed collar that Becky put on the shoulder pad.
I told her that it was too Star
Trek looking, but I think we fulfilled the challenge.
Ithinkit 'saverycool garment, but if we could have speeded things up, we probably could have done a better job.
I'mpleasedthatitlooks beautiful but I really feel that this could have been super dynamic.
Regardless of how simple the dress is, it's still a pretty sight.
I'mthinking,like,thisis beautiful.
The pants and the top fit perfectly, and they're flowing beautifully.
But then, when you get up to the hair, we were like, uh-oh.
Shelooksgreat.
You couldn't see any resemblance of a stilt in there, and I was afraid of that.
But I know that they are gonna hit me hard with the hairstyling.
It's just traumatic.
IreallythinkthatAnthony and I have a really good chance in having the winning design.
It's chic, it's Parisian couture, just like Tim said, but yet it's got drama involved.
The charmeuse skirt is flying, the pants look beautiful and full.
It's just perfect.
I'msuperproudofjust what
Laura and I have accomplished.
Ours is definitely the wow dress.
I'm amazed at how the fabric just went.
It's just phenomenal.
Didyouenjoyshowingoff your work to a live audience today?
Verymuch.
Weexpectedto see show-stopping garments today, and we were very impressed by some of your designs, but others didn't do as well as we expected.
The winner of this challenge will receive immunity and cannot be eliminated for next week.
Olivier, you won the last challenge, so today you cannot be eliminated.
We scored your designs as they came down the runway.
One of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
Olivier, Anya, your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Anthony, Laura, Danielle,
Cecilia, Kimberly, Becky, your teams had the highest scores.
Yes.
JoshuaandJulie,Bertand
Viktor, Fallene and Bryce, your teams had the lowest scores.
We're going to talk to the team with the highest scores first and then we'll bring you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Itwasamess.
It really was a mess, I'm sorry to say this.
I feel like ours is--they're gonna say harsh things.
Well,here'sthefunnything.
If you look at it, costume, costume, costume.
Yeah.
Who'sontherunway?
Ready to wear, ready to wear, ready to wear.
Itjustfeelsveryhorrible, the wait, like somebody punched you in the stomach and threw you down on the stage.
Anthony,Laura,tellusabout your look.
Wedecidedon thecolorred.
You know, we wanted a wow.
Carla was gonna just, when she walked out, it was like, whoa.
Ilikedit alot .
I think it was dramatic enough.
I loved all those little pieces.
You know, you can always tell when designers do that, it means so much work.
I guess most people probably think it's just, like, thrown on there and glued together.
Ididnothand-sewanyof that.
It is all with a hot glue gun.
ScrapwhatIsaidbefore.
Well...
Ilovedthislook.
I love that color.
I love the detailing of the little black belt.
This looked so elegant, not costumey at all.
It looks amazing.
Ireallylikethis.
I thought it was very beautiful, the way it flowed and the way the wind made it move was beautiful.
My only worry--and Anthony, we've had this on two occasions with you--is it's a little referential to me.
It looks like something that
I've seen, so please try to be original when you design.
But other than that, it is absolutely beautiful.
Ithinkthetrickiestthing to do is, if you scaled it down and she wasn't on stilts, would it still be fabulous?
And I think it would still be fabulous.
Butwhotakesmore responsibility for this gorgeous look?
Well,I toldherbeforewe got here, I was like, if we get up there, I want you to take it.
That'snice.
All right, Danielle, Cecilia, tell us about your look.
Itreflectsverymuchwhat we do.
Uh, we wanted to create elegance.
So,whodidwhatexactly?
Whenwesawthe stiltwalkers,
I instantly thought of doing a huge sleeve, so I was really married to the blouse idea and then Cecilia came up with the pants.
Ilikethislook.
I like the blouse.
I like the color combination.
I like the brown pants and I like the way you constructed them.
I like the sheerness, that you can see through.
I think that's very nice.
What ruins it for me is her head.
Thehairis crazy!
I mean, my God!
Ilovethislook.
I think this is so chic, and I love bling, and I do love that detailing, and I think the thing that stood out to me the most was just that color, I think, is so rich.
Thankyou.
Thankyou,Kim.
It'sa veryprettyoutfit.
Ithoughtyoupickeda beautiful fabric, but it's about drama, and it's too quiet.
Listen,youpickedthe trickiest fabric in the world.
I mean, chiffon, and to do it impeccably is--it takes so much time.
Wewereverycomfortable using chiffon, which everybody thought it was a bit crazy, given the restraint on time.
Mm-hmm.
Anditwasactuallyacrazy idea.
Becauseyoucandoa chiffon pant like that and make someone just look like a mess, and she doesn't.
KimberlyandBecky,tellus about your look.
Weknewinstantlywhenwegot our model that we wanted to do something edgy.
We wanted to play on each other's strengths.
So she's strong in jackets.
I like structure, so I wanted to do a tailored pant.
Iwasveryimpressedwhen I saw this outfit.
You tailored the pants and it still is a showstopper because it is so sharp, because it is almost perfect.
Thankyou.
Ithinkyouguysarekick-ass tailors.
I mean, you really cut a mean pant.
Thankyou.
Thanks.
Thankyou.
It'llmakeeverywomanwho wants to wear it want to get that tattoo.
You need the tattoo.
Ilovethepants.
Oh,thankyou.
Lovethepants.
My only detail that I feel could have been edited is that half-collar.
It just looks a little circusy.
But all in all, it was one of my favorite looks too.
Thankyou.
Nowwe'regoingtotalk to the designers with the lower scores.
Thank you very much.
You can leave the runway.
Bert, Viktor, tell us about your look.
Ichosethebottompart 'cause I wanted it to be a little bit more modern and thin.
And Bert chose the top part.
We did--had our little struggles, and we did--had miscommunications and things like that.
Tome,it 'slikethe wallpaper and curtains at a really tacky catering hall.
Mm-hmm.
Ihatethatdustruffleof gold on the top of it.
It's just, it's really old.
It'salmostlikeinthemovie
The Sound of Music, when they took the drapes off and made their clothes, but like Marie
Antoinette days.
It really does look like curtains.
Ithinkit lookslikeabad costume.
It's terrible.
Idon'tbelievethatthis was what I wanted to present.
Soyouthinkit'shis responsibility.
Ididn'tcreatethis.
Okay.
Viktor, what do you think?
Iownit .
I think we both worked at it at the end and we finished it and--
Sowhenyousay ,"Iownit,"
it means that it was your idea.
Imean,Iown the workwith him because we both did very much 50-50.
"Iownit "?
50-50 is not "I own it."
No,like,no ,notown it.
I guess I'm being responsible for it.
Sothatmeansifthis outfit today is the worst look, you would be the one to go home?
Oh,no.
No, no.
Well,then,that'snot owning it.
Bert,you'returningslightly lobster color.
Oh,amI?
Sorry.
He was very emphatic about, "I want to do this, we need to do a
Victorian," and I found it unusual that he wouldn't sketch.
He said, "Well, you sketch it.
You sketch better."
Whywouldyounot sketch something?
No,I-I--no,Idid sketch.
No,youtoldme, "Bert,you sketch, you sketch."
It'sinmy HP computer.
Itseemslikeyou two had a lovely day yesterday.
Yes.
Allright,fromone strange look to the next, Fallene and
Bryce, tell us about your outfit.
Ihadtheidea,becausewe were working with such long legs, that we could do a really, really big, kind of full tulle skirt and then we were gonna have cute little details up on the top.
Butliterally,yougavehera
Black Swan.
Yeah.
Idon'tgetit.
Thishasno effortput into it.
It does look like just a tank top that I wear to bed and it looks like a tie wrapped around the waist a couple times.
This just looks like you could have done this in 15 minutes.
Youknow,Ithinktheidea had so much promise.
However, there's nothing.
There's no detail.
It's just the beginning of something.
It's--it's--likeyousaid, it's, like, half done.
Soit'slikenonedone ,then .
Yeah.
Iloveherheadpiece.
I think the headpiece is nice.
Well,I 'msogladImade something.
Ithinktheheadpieceis great.
Listen, to me, it's like she's got every dance reference and it ends up just looking like nothing because they don't meld.
SoBryce,if thiswas the worst look, who do you think should go home?
Um,I thinkbothofus.
I think that--I think this was a team effort.
Unfortunately,itwouldbe only one.
IthinkIshouldbeableto stay.
I did my best.
Iwouldsaymyself.
IwouldsayFallene.
Josh,Julie,tellusabout your look.
Well,I cameup withthe concepts.
Andtheconceptwas circus?
No,itwasmatador.
Ole,ole,ole!
I mean, guys, you know, drama doesn't mean tacky.
Spanishmatador,youcan be inspired by that, you know, and that could be really chic.
You know, we've seen it.
Ijustthinkit'syetanother
Halloween costume.
It's the weirdest hybrid I've ever heard of.
Andshe'sgotthesetiny arms and these extremely long legs.
It gives her a very bizarre-- when she walked out, I was like, huh.
Forget the matador, circus, and all that.
Theonlypositivethingthat
I could say about this outfit is, it looks well made.
Iagree.
Imean,it is sharp.
That it is, definitely.
So if we decide that this is the worst look for today, who should go home?
Well,itwasmyidea ,andI 'm not gonna throw Josh under the bus.
Whatdoyouthink,Josh ?
Iwouldhopenot togohome, and I would not choose myself.
Soyou'resayingyou would choose Julie.
Yes,I wouldchooseJulie.
Okay,sowe 'veheardwhat you had to say.
We're gonna have a little chat and then I'll call you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Thankyou.
Let'stalkaboutthe designs and the designers that we did like today.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Thegarmentreallylooked modern, dramatic, exciting.
Well,itwasthe rightchoice of color, it was the right way to do the pants, and it still looks like a gown.
Ithoughtit wasbeautifulon the model wearing stilts, and I could picture it on a woman without the stilts.
Thatwaspretty.
Then we have Danielle and
Cecilia.
Ihappenedto likethat outfit.
I think it's just really chic.
Andthebeadingwas beautiful.
Theplushereistotakethat chiffon and make something that is finished beautifully.
The chiffon, if you make a mistake, she's in a rag.
DanielleandCecilia,they both know how to sew.
Oh,yeah.
Theydo.
Yousawit here.
BeckyandKimberly.
Thesimpletruthis, they sent out something impeccably tailored.
The pants were fantastic.
Andtheproportionswere right.
Yes.
Italsodidn'tlooklike two designers did something and they stuck it together.
Butrealistically,theyhad a very cohesive look.
Yeah,I thoughtthatit looked like it was done by one person.
Metoo.
Let'stalkaboutthe designers that we didn't like.
Even though it was Julie's idea to make this circus matador outfit, I can still see Josh's bedazzling in there.
They'reanoddteam,when you think about Julie and Josh.
Julie is, you know, rocky, you know, mountain woman, and Josh is like, bedazzle it, glamorous, and kind of those two things together ended up with this insane, very tacky matador outfit.
Yeah.
Youareadesigner.
You're selling design, you're selling taste.
Imean,therewas likeso many details, you didn't know where to look.
It was crazy.
Bryce and Fallene.
Yougetto theBlackSwan /Bob
Fosse combo.
I mean, the hat was the only thing that had any bit of charm or, I don't know, personality.
Itlookedliketwo different eras.
It was like showgirl hat, ballerina--I--you know, it didn't go together at all.
Yeah.
Dance hall girl, modern dance, and ballet, all combined.
What if they hadn't had-- aninspiration.
There was nothing.
It was a promise of an idea, but they couldn't deliver anything.
I mean, I'm not defending Bryce, but I think at least he's got a little more spunk.
Buttheonlythingthat we did like was the hat, and she made the hat.
Ifthehatwasn'tthere,you really would have fallen asleep.
ViktortotallythrewBert under the bus.
He didn't really say it, but he did.
Well,BertthrewViktorunder the bus too.
IjustthinkthatViktoris full of it, and he just--
Idotoo.
Youknow,IbelieveBert when he says he didn't do a drawing and all of that stuff.
Shouldn'tBerthavesaid,
"You know what?
I think this thing is not working."
It's ugly drapes.
I mean, they're ugly drapes.
Awfulfabric.
Everythingbadin thehouse on your body.
Sowe'vemadeour decision?
Okay, let's bring them back out.
Your teams represent the highest and the lowest scores.
One designer will be the winner of this challenge and one designer will be out.
AnthonyRyanandLaura,you two did a great job.
Laura, congratulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
That means that you have immunity next time.
Anthony Ryan, we think that you also did a great job.
Laura and Anthony Ryan, you can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
Winningisawesome,but it's also wonderful winning with such a great partner that was so gracious.
Oh!
I knewit .
So who won?
Idid.
Oh!

Both:
Thankyou.
Josh,Julie,you'rein.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyouverymuch.
Thank you.
Bert,Viktor,youhaveto remember that dramatic does not mean costumey.
Your fabric choice was so very wrong that almost anything that you would have done with it would have been bad.
Bert, you're in.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
BryceandFallene,yourlook was boring ballerina.
It looked like there was no effort put into it.
Bryce, you're in.

Iwasn'treadyfor Joshto go.
He has so much talent, and there's people like Fallene that don't even know really what their direction is at this point.
She talks to much about being a hairstylist, I'm not even sure if she's a designer, you know?
Mm-hmm.
[Yawning]Oh,man.
I'm just freakin' nervous for today.
I'm like, maybe I'm too much of a normal person.
I never thought I would be normal, but...

He is just saying the wrong things at the wrong time.
It annoys me.

There'sa bigbull's-eyeon the two of us.
Forthefirsttimeever on

[All gasp]
Whoa.
I got goosebumps.
Just the bigness of it is very, very exciting to me.
Soyourjobistomakesure that your look will stand out...
But be in at the same time.
Good luck, everybody.
And we all will see you on the outdoor runway.
[Cheers and applause]
Let's go, girls.

And I really like pattern.
Ithinkof crazythings sometimes.
You know, obviously, sometimes-- no,yeah,keepgoing.
Youknow?
Talktome ,becauseifyou talk and I can draw-- butsometimes,we canhave them like they're coming out of something, you know?
Right.
Iwasthinkingmorelike old
Hollywood.
Something more classic, so...
MaeWest?
Yeah,like,evenMae West.
Exactly.
Like it's a--it's-- you can make it have pants.
MaeWestneverworepants.
Her entire life.
No, she didn't.
She wore skirts.
Bertistoodefensive.
He needs to calm down.
[Indistinct chatter]
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Howexcitedareyou about this challenge?
It's completely thrilling.
I want you to think about a couple of things.
Think about Paris Couture Week.
It causes you to question what's real and what isn't.
Very much like this challenge.
I'm always looking at fashion illustrations, which I happen to love, but I always say, "These aren't real women."
Well, for this challenge, they are.
Everyonealwayssaysthat when I draw my fashion figures, they're so, like, long.
It's kind of like our fashion illustrations get to come to life.
It's a pretty exciting challenge, I think, for all the designers.
Iambringinginyour stilt walker models.
You will have 30 minutes to consult with them as a team.
We're going shopping at Mood, and each team will have a budget of $500.
Whoo!
Andyouhaveone day for this challenge.
So it's today.
Noway.
Way.
Areyoucrazy?
SoI 'msendingin your models.
Have fun!
Doesithavetobepants ?
Iwouldimagine.
Probably.
Sothatyoucan-- thedresswouldget tangled.
Yeah,yeah.
That'd be a disaster.
Oh,great,Ihavenevereven talked to her.
She's never really talked to me.
But we agreed on kind of a look and a style, and realized, "Oh, she makes great pants."
And I make great tailored jackets, so...
That's what we're doing.
Yes.
Hey,ladies.
Over here.
Hi,howareyou ?
[Overlapping chatter]
Sithere.
Okay.
Icancrouchall the way down to, like...
Like that, or-- whataboutsleeves?
Does that bother you?
Howisit ,walkingin something...
Long and full?
Itisimportantthatit's not below where my feet fasten into my stilts.
Whereyourstiltis.
Becauseitcausesyou to tumble.
Ourinspirationforthis design, we're thinking Parisian couture.
Just a really flattering silhouette, and not make her look like she's in the circus, walking down a runway.
Theway--I'mthinkingdrapey.
Okay,realdrapey.
Okay.
I'mthinkinglikethis.
Butthinkcircus-ytoo .
Oh,I--Iam .
Like, think about it moving back behind her.
Like, it's gonna be like flowing and moving.
So Fallene and I know that we want to do a big, full skirt.
And we're inspired by our model.
She has been a ballerina forever.
She's got tattoos, funky hair.
We definitely want to go with this kind of dark ballerina.
KindoflikeQueenVictoriaa little bit, like, just...
Oh,that'sverygood.
Alittlebitbig here.
Nice, big, like, open here.
But maybe a big collar.
But it's sexy here.
Uh-huh.
QueenVictoriawasin mourning for 50 years.
I don't think that's a sexy direction I would like to go into.
Ifyoudo adressthat 'slike a bust like here, her boobs are gonna be showing like this.
That'snotVictorian.
That's Elizabethan.
Well,whatever.
Well,there'sadifference.
Bertisaknow-it-all.
He's just very obnoxious.
Viktorreallyneedstodoa little bit of book reading.
Designers...
Say good-bye to your models.
They will be back later today for a fitting.
[Indistinct chatter]
Bye!
Thankyou,ladies.
All right, let's head out to our first trip to Mood.
So follow me.
Design teams, here we go.
Your 30 minutes begins...
Right now.
Alittlebithere,here , here, and more here, and then boom.
Viktor.
Bert,darling.
Whereareyou?
Whereareyou?
Backhere.
Look.
Follow my voice.
Iwantto to ,like,akimono with this, and then have big sleeves, and not go-- sobigsleevesmeancouture?
I literally had to bite my tongue.
How much training do you have in couture?
What'sthis?
Ourgameplanistojustpull every red shade that we like.
We have our grocery list.
So it's just a matter of executing it.
Yeah,I likethispattern better.
Butasfarasthat ,Ifeel like it should be more modern.
Areyoutwoall right?
Yes,we'regreat.
Okay.
You're kind of a dream team.
So...
We'rehavingagoodtime .
Wehavehighexpectations.
Iwaslookingforwardtoa team challenge, and to have one with Oliver, it is a dream.
Canthisbe pleated?
Ugh.
Julie,anythingin lifecan be pleated.
She was rockin' my nerves.
Ooh,I likethetextureof this.
Chiffon is the lightest of all the fabrics you can grab.
It's like this...
[Exhales]
Of silk.
So I think it'd be cool to do something that's almost a muted, like, really muted polka dot.
This is way too [bleep]-- insteadofthedenim?
Yeah.
Okay,gofindit.
I'mnotsettlingfor all black.
We're not creating a freakin' gothic...stilt walker.
Youhavetwominutes remaining.
Oh!
Okay.
Soweneedtohurryup.
Yes,weneedtohurryup.
Thankyou.
Thereisnothinglikeit,so
I'm just grabbing anything.
Geta lotof it .
Allright,designers.
Time is up.
Design teams at the register.
Anya, you're walking the wrong way.
So let's head back to Parsons.
Thank you, Mood!
All:
Thankyou!
Hey.
Yeah,let'snotfocussomuch on this.
Well,that'spartofthe dress.
I'mnotsayingwe're building a-- no,I 'mnotdisagreeingwith anything you're saying, though.
Ijustwanttomake sure we know what we're going as far as units.
We've agreed on the silhouette.
It's going to be a strapless bustier piece, and then there'll be this full skirt.
MayI haveyourattention, just for a moment?
You have until 9:00 tonight.
All right, work hard.
I will see you later.
Thank you.
Doyoufeelcomfortable making very well-fitting pants?
I'mcomfortablewithpattern making, so...
Okay,foryour...
Otherlooks, were you happy with the fit?
Lady,I makecustom-made clothing for people with all kind of bodies.
I know how to fit pants.
YouknowthatIwantedthe other prints, right?
Like a more modern print.
They might say it might be dated, 'cause it's a little bit too flowery.
It's gonna be definitely a challenge to work with that ugly fabric.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
Ithinkthisfabricis genius.
Assoonas he foundthe fabric, I knew the idea.
Josh and myself are doing a romantic matador stilt walker.
Imean,youcoloredit,not me.
Butifyoudon 'tput it underneath the whole dress and the jacket, then you're gonna-- it's gonna be messy.
Whatdoyoumean,messy?
Ithoughttheshapewas supposed to be kind of roundish.
Ifeelthisdirectionwe're taking is absolutely wrong.
It's not what we need to be presenting in 2011.
Whydon'tyoufinishthis , since you have the whole idea?
No,I don'thavethe whole idea.
This is a design that we're working on together.
No,I know.
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying--no, no, no.
You need to hold on.
You need to hold on.
Letmefinish.
I'llbeback.
Okay,youcomeback.
Ican'tdealwithyou.
It's like you act like a small kid, like, you--you don't let me talk.
No,' causeyou'regetting confused.
No,it'snotaquestion.
It's not a question.
It was a comment.
Okay,well,I'mmakinga statement.
Saveitforthe judge.
He's, like, so immature.
He's like a 57-year-old kid.
It's only his way or the highway.
It's kind of difficult to make sense with somebody who's crazy.
[Whistling]
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
We'reallfeelingtense.
Anyone could go down because of their teammate.
That'sveryimmature.
What'simmatureis you'renot letting me finish.
[Clearsthroat]
What was that about?
What?
What are you talking about?
[Both laugh]
I just think he kind of just gets defensive right away.
And it's unnecessary.
He'sshakingin hisboots.
He doesn't have immunity this time.
Here'stheskirt.
And I was just saying, like, since you have the idea how you're doing this-- that'sfine,butyou switched fabrics on us a couple times.
It'smostlyyourdesign.
I'm just kind of following you.
No,itisn't.
Butwecouldgoonandon and talk about-- no,I 'mjustgettingthat-- clarifying what I understood we said in the store.
Okay,so,youwanttotalk- - thatwasmy understanding.
Well, no, but it...
Bertwillfightyou on anything, even if there is nothing to fight about.
Idon'twanttodebatethat.
I just wanna do this.
MaybeI do.
That'sveryimmature.
No,it'snot.
What's immature is you're not letting me finish.
Okay,it's--letme hearyou .
That'sallI'msaying.
Youknow,Idon 'tknowwhat
Bert has in his mind.
I almost feel like he does things on purpose to sabotage me, or maybe it's a strategy.
I don't--I have no idea.
Working,working,working, working.
Thehardestpartofdesigning a garment for a stilt walker is figuring out how to make her look as chic as possible, and also to make it safe.
Yeah,butthisiswhat I'm envisioning.
Fullness, we want at the bottom.
So we need a hoop, right?
Right.
Laura and I agree on making a cage for a big hoop skirt.
Almost like an old Alabama plantation girl.
Thiswillbe an old petticoat?
Yes.
Just allow for some volume on the bottom to get that dramatic effect, but so it didn't get caught under the model's stilts.
So I'm cutting all this boning and gluing and circles.
And...
A lot of math.
[Singsong]Teamwork.
Whatdoyouthink the color should be?
Well,justsomethinghigh around the neck.
Either wrapping or, like-- we want dramatic.
Ithink,whenitcomesto group challenge, it's not about how brilliant or how amazing you can do by yourself.
It's much more about the collaboration and communication between the two people.
No,I wannado ,like,a little bullfighter jacket.
But--but the sleeves so you can hold it and be, like...
Right.
Doesthatmakesense?
And then, if you made a bustier-- but,like,doesthatmake sense?
Doesthatmakesense?
Doyouneedtopoke me?
Quit poking me.
You're like a poker and a puncher.
You're such a rough chick.
I'mthemanhere.
MeandJuliecouldbasically flop genders.
[Laughter]
Soonceyoumakethis pattern, you think you can base all the other ones off of this, right?
Yeah.
Okay,good.
A lot of teams thought that we were crazy for working with chiffon.
And, yeah, it's a little bit of a risk.
Okay.
Mostdesignersconsider chiffon difficult.
Danielle and I are very comfortable with those fabrics.
And we love how it flows and how it moves.
The thing about Becky's personality is I really can't read it.
She stares a lot.
She just stares.
So you just wonder what's going through her mind.
What?
What?
I think we're all feeling tense because anyone could go down because of their teammate.
So it's not just about one person anymore.
So it's anybody's game today.
[Sighs]
Youmakingagianttutu ?
[Chuckles]Yeah.
Awesome.
Beckysoundedscaredwhenshe said that.
"You're making a black tutu?"
You were in the bottom last time, right?
It'sprettyimportantfor me and Bryce to do well.
We were both in the bottom, and we both got paired up together.
Weneedto havesomething that is a thin line between costume and fashion.
Bryce,I justwanttolook at this real quick with you.
This bodice with that is, like, pretty blah.
And I really feel like that turquoise as a waistband would-- no.
Why?
Absolutelynot.
Whynot?
Dude,it'stoomuch.
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
This is way too much pop.
No, I am not doing the turquoise.
Okay.
Bryceistakingoverallthe control, so I'm feeling like I can't have any input because he'll probably bite my head off.
Justgetthebodicedone first, and then we'll worry about this stuff later.
Okay.
Ithinkhe trustsmewith the style that I'm doing.
Yeah.
Yeah,yeah.
WorkingwithJoshisactually surprisingly really smooth.
Wasthisateamchallenge?
[Laughs]
'CauseI 'mworkingalone.
[Laughter]
No,whereis she?
It'sfine.
It's quiet over here.
Ooh,dramaon 34thstreet.
[Laughter]
Soa couplehoursintothis challenge, Anthony's been trying to make this cage that we had a great idea for.
Thisisliterallygonnatake hours.
I mean, what do you think about that?
'Causeifyouthinkthis isn't working, we can't spend any time on it.
Thisisn'tgonnawork.
Okay.
Problemsolved.
Weneedto scratchitand move forward.
Soitmightjustlook awesome, because then we have to put the pants everywhere.
Allthelayers,yeah.
Kimberly,whatdo youthink?
I have a collar on here.
Uh...
Ithinkit 'snottoo
Star Trek-y, it's, uh--
Ithinkwe definitelyneed something here.
You know, everybody's going big and elaborate;
We gotta-- getsomesparkle.
Wegottagetsomething.
KimberlyandIare getting along fine.
But I wasn't gonna let her put gold lame on that thing.
Sorry.
Gross.
[Sighs]
Ijustwanttomake sure that...
I'm, like, cutting it on the right grain.
I feel like I am, though.
Well,youshouldbematching it, sweetheart.
Any piece of fabric, you have threads that are going this way and threads that are going this way.
So you should have your grain on your drape.
Right,yeah.
It'sreallyimportanttoline up your fabric on grain, meaning grain line that matches up with this thread.
If it doesn't, then it can skew the whole thing.
Yeah,youneedtobecareful.
'Cause it's--if it gets off grain, you're screwed.
Okay.
Ijustgotout ofschool,so it's all fresh in my head.
Did you ever go to school?
No.
Youneverwenttoschool?
Hm-mmm.
Oh.
Fallene has no training.
She is self-taught.
And I'm worried about that.
IfeellikeIhave toconfirm everything with you right now, because I'm totally lost.
No,ifit makesyou feel good, I don't mind being comforting.
Ijustcouldnot see the grain line on that fabric.
[Sighs] Oh, God.
I'm glad we have a good relationship, Bryce.
[Softly]Shedidn'tknowhow to cut it on-grain.
[Loudly]What?
Ongrain.
Sodidshe,like,take the fabric and was like, "wah!"
It'sjustadifferenceof being self-taught and going to school.
She'strying,but...
Right.
I'vebeenturningintothe boss.
Whichthenwillput alotof responsibility on your shoulders, though.
'Cause then, at the end, if it comes down to they still didn't like it, then they're like,
"Well, who led?"
It's hard.
Hello,designers!
All:
Hi,Tim.
JoshuaandJulie.
Hi,Tim.
Howareyouall ?
We'redefinitelyhelpingeach other out, and I think our styles will collide.
Collide...
Orconverge?
Both:
Converge.
Okay.
Ithinkwe 'll...
They'vecollidedalittle bit, but...
We'regonnago forthis little Spanish feel.
She'sa bullfighter?
Both:
Yes.
Ole!
Pshew!
Juliehasbeenworkingon that jacket forever.
Butit'scute.
Lookatthisbeautiful...
Wefoundthisgreatfabric.
And I think it's gonna create like a great--
Ithinkit 'ssmashing.
Smashing.
IloveJoshuaM's pants.
It reminds me of Beetlejuice.
Carryon.
Appreciateit.
CeceliaandDanielle,how are you doing?
Good.
We're doing sort of a tailored blouse with a teal chiffon with a big, huge, billowy sleeve.
Okay.
Andtheseareour fabrics.
We're using a lot of materials that we both like.
Sowhenshewalks,youknow, these sleeves will billow back.
And it's all about movement.
Yeah.
Well,it'sallaboutthe proportion of the bottom garment to the top garment.
And it just needs--needs to work.
Theproportionsareso different, we are unfamiliar with how this look will fit.
ViktorandBert.
Talk to me.
Iguesswe wantedtostart with a bodice and do something very tight.
And also, a little bit of structure, just to create the drama.
Drama'simportant.
But this isn't intended to be a costume.
No,no.
No .
GoodLord.
That thing is ghastly.
Ithinkhe wasthinkingof doing it this way, and I was thinking of doing it the other way.
Iwantedto do acontemporary look, and he was at, "Well, I really think we should do this."
And I had some other ideas, and, no, this is what we have to do.
No,that'snottrue.
Whenever I suggest, "that doesn't work;
Maybe we could do something like this," and automatically, he goes, "That's not gonna work.
This won't work."
So right now, I'm in the point where I'm just kind of trying to get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtrying-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Areyouworried?
It's nerve-racking, because this thing might fall apart.
No,no,likethis.
I mean, this is [bleep] up because I listened to you.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
I'mjustkindoftryingto get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtryingto-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
CanI tellyouwhatconcerns me about our conversation?
I don't think I've heard either of you say "We."
This has to be a "We."
Yeah.
Itneedsto be .
Yeah.
Well,earlier,he said,
"This is your design," and I said, "No, it's not."
No,I didn'tsaythat.
Youdid.
Whateveryou'regoingtodo, you need to do it now.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Wow, color.
Red.
Red.
When you said "Paris," that's the big key word, that did it for me, having that dramatic feel to it.
Theseshoulderpadsare very on trend for fall.
We'remakingtheskirtoutof this.
Then we're lining it with the charmeuse that we made these out of, so I'm-- andyoufeelyou can control this well enough?
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, if you can pull this off, I think it's a wow moment.
That'swhatwe wantto hear, right?
Yeah.
Becky and Kimberly.
Beckykindof thoughtof military, and I kind of was like punk, which the model was totally for and about.
Andshehasatattooonher collarbone.
Mm-hmm.
Andsowe wentwitha one-shoulder so we could see this great tattoo over here.
Oh.
Ijustmadethe greensleeve and now I'm gonna make one in the stripe to see which one we like better.
I'mhopingthatthisworksin the stripe.
Yeah.
You'veworkedwelltogether?
Yeah.
She makes good pants, I make good jackets.
We divide and conquer.
Great.
Thankyou.
Thanks,Tim.
IfeellikeIhave ablack cloud over me.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
How are you feeling?
I--I'mgood.
I'm-- youare?
I'mjustworriedit'sgetting too big.
Heidi said, "Go big."
I was gonna keep going.
This is my gut telling me to stop.
Youlistento yourgut , both of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatisthistextilebeing used for?
Um,sothisisgonnabethe bodice.
I liked the polka dot because I felt that it gave some color and some pop, which is me.
Rightnow,Ireallywant
Fallene to get this bodice done so that we can worry about the pants.
Okay,go.
Go ,go ,go .
Thankyou.
AnyaandOlivier.
I'd love to hear what you're doing.
Well,theideawas ,uh, because Olivier's really menswear and I do womens wear, we have this polar opposite way of working and way of seeing things.
Ithinkthismakesyoua great team.
Yeah,andso it 'sgonnahave this tight feeling of, like, things holding her.
Uh-huh.
Andthisgoingontopof this.
I'llbeblunt.
I think it's unexpected.
Timseemsalittlethrownoff by our fabric selections.
Maybe he just doesn't know how to say, "I don't like it."
[Laughs]
Bye,everybody.
All:
Bye, Tim.
Havea goodnight.
Thanks.
Youtoo.
Bertzilla.
Bertzilla,yousaid?
Yeah.
Isthatmy newname?
I'mgonnacutthissoit won't be boggy.
Yeah,yeah,cool.
Unlessyouwantthat.
No,it'scool.
Beautiful.
Timdidmentionall heheard was "I, I, I," which is true, but I am willing to just start again, like, leave that behind and enjoy the moment.
Becauseofthat,thisis taking forever.
I'm sorry.
Justgetit done.
Iwill.
IthinkBryceand Falleneare in trouble because even though they have this great, voluminous tutu that's really impressive looking, there's nothing else that they have.
And I know Fallene's having trouble getting the bodice done.
Isitalmostdone?
It'sdone,butwhatelse do we need to sew?
ThecincherthatIwasgonna have you do, it's basically here's the two pieces together.
I'm showing Julie a quick and effective way to get a ruching effect for the waistband.
Leave these two ends open and stitch this one side down.
And then you're gonna have to grab this.
Oh,yeah,yeah.
Bringitallthe way overto here, and then it's all gonna shrink into itself and it's just gonna make, like, a great cover belt.
Perfect.
I'minsuchbad shapewith this.
We don't have time.
No,golikethis,golike this.
Here.
Go just like-- no,no.
Likethis.
Imadethisis[ bleep]edup because I listened to you.
No, I really don't care about [bleep] anymore.
I'll make interfacing.
I'm sorry.
Itiswhatitis,Danielle.
Attheendofthenight ,I'm already concerned because it's a one-day challenge and chiffon takes double the time.
Hello.
[Overlapping chatter]
Thisisso weird.
Howdoyouput pantson?
Pantsfirst,thenstilts.
I'venever,like-- neverhemmedagiantbefore.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
It's like Alice in Wonderland.
Thisisafantasy.
It's not a costume, okay?
That's the word.
It's fantasy.
Howlongdo we have?
Ten minutes?
Whyareyouworried?
Well,I wantto seeitcome together.
Nowitlookslikeamess.
Yeah.
Oh,myGod.
It's gonna come out okay.
Doyouhaveabodicetofit on her?
Yeah.
Oh,good.
Holdthatand,like...
Is it?
I'll re-cut it.
I know, it's--it's looking weird.
It'soff-grain.
It'slookingweird.
[Bleep].
Okay.
Once I put the bodice onto her,
I thinking, oh, why is this all wonky?
And didn't even realize that I didn't cut it on-grain.
I just feel like I can't do simple things right now 'cause
I'm, like, so tired and on edge.
WhenFallenecutsthe bodice off-grain, it's a big deal, and you have to immediately re-cut.
I'm worried that she won't have enough time to do something like that.
I just--I don't know how this is gonna go.
Seeyoutomorrow.
Ciao.
Bye.
Itlooksokay.
Actually, this looks nice.
[Both laugh]
I'm sorry, I don't mean to snap at you, it's just there is no time for getting fancy at this point.
Oh,Bryce.
What happened to me today?
This is really bad.
Ihaveafeelingwe'regonna be in the bottom two or the bottom three.
Itjust--it'sjustreally disappointing.
I let Bryce down 'cause I just could not finish my garment, so it's...
I'm sorry.
It'sokay.
It'sreallygonnalookbad for you.
I'm so sorry.
[Sniffles]
Allright,guys,let 'smove.
[Alarm beeps]
Areyouexcitedfor today?
I'mwonderingwherewe're going.
That's the exciting part.
[Laughter]
Ithinkouroutfitlooks good.
Ithinkit looksvery,very good.
It's--it'sdefinitelywhat you and I put together.
IthinknowI'm okaywith it.
Yesterday, I was a little bit hoping for a thunderstorm.
Everyonewasintense yesterday.
Some people here, they can whip [bleep] up so fast, you know?
Like, I feel like I'm not at that level to do that.
Dothebestyou can .
Just do the best you can.
IwishIhad mysoul right now.
I feel like I'm kind of-- well,maybeyou'llfinditin the workroom today.
Maybe it's sitting under a table just waiting for you.
All right.
Later.
Let'sgo.
[Overlapping chatter]
Well,sincewe finishedon time, we can chill.
Maybegluesomeofthefabric from here?
Sure.
I'mgonnafigureout whether or not we can do, like, a tube top or something like that.
Westillhavealotofthis left.
I'mnervousaboutwhatpeople are gonna think.
The bodice is cut off-grain, so it's a mess.
We could send it down but I feel like it's too bad.
Brycedecideslastminuteto just put together a tube top, and I just let him take over at that point.
Falleneissweet.
Bryce really pushed her around a bit.
He's very sort of a bossy kid.
Oh,youchangedthe top ?
Itwasnotcut on-grain.
Oh,right.
Like,itlookedlikeitwas melting or something awful.
Ithinkthatlooks--that'll look nice.
Yeah.
Okay, we're done talking about it.
It needs to be sewn, because this jacket has taken you over
12 hours and-- itlooksgreat.
Oh,Julie.
Oh!
Oh,Julie.[Growls]
Didyou--didyou--didyou manage to stitch some of the shoulder last night?
No,itwassotighttothe mannequin.
I didn't have time to sew everything perfectly.
It's nerve-racking because I'm worried that this thing might fall apart.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Thisisgoingtobeahugely jam-packed morning.
In an hour and a half, we are leaving the workroom for our outdoor runway.
Ithasn'tbeendoneonthe show before, and to be a part of the first public runway makes me completely speechless.
IfeellikeI'm running around with my head cut off, 'cause I don't think that I'm gonna have enough time to sew up a new top.
Comingupon project runway...
Thehairlookslikea pumpkin.
Iknowwe bothdon 'tthink this is our best work.
We'reheadedto ourfirst outdoor runway ever.
I'msortof freakingout .
No,you'regonnabefine .
Idon'tthinkthere'sany making this attractive.
[Sighs]
Son of a bitch.
Bryceiscompletelystressed out, and I felt bad but after seeing what he's producing, I'm sort of freaking out.
Idon'tknow.
Maybe I should put the zip in.
Idon'tfeelthat'sright.
I don't know.
I'mjust--I'mhonestlyso frustrated right now.
I mean, I know we both don't think this is our best work.
Like,ifwe justadd ,like,a couple little-- foryourjacket.
It'smajor.
IfJoshwantstobedazzle,
I'm gonna let him do it.
[Laughs]
Wehavealot moretodo-- all the finishing work on the skirt and then attach it to the bodice.
I'm just hoping we have enough time.
IknewIwantedtocreatea headpiece, knowing that this is a team effort and I didn't create anything.
And so I got the red feathers.
I broke 'em up with some of the fabric to kind of bring something interesting to this garment.
It'sbeautiful.
It's really stunning.
ThisistheJoshside .
Andyouseweditbeautifully.
It's sewn beautifully.
With Julie, I knew it could go one of two ways--completely horrible or amazing between both of us, and I think that we're gonna do something that might shock a lot of people.
Designers,I amsendingin your models.
You will have an hour to send your models to the L'Oreal Paris makeup room and the Garnier hair studio.
The Piperlime wall, of course, is important here.
I'm being very strict about the schedule this morning because we have a curtain call, everyone.
Right.
Allright?
Thank you.
[Overlapping chatter]
Makeitjustatadbit tighter.
Josh,youwanttodomakeup?
I think you're gonna be better at that than I will.
I'llwageryouthat.

I'msotired.
Oh,no.
That'snotwhattheywant .
Thanksforthat.
Thehairlookslikeahuge pumpkin on her head.
There was nothing we could do at this point because we had to walk out of there.
Designersandmodels,let 's go.
We're headed to our first outdoor runway ever and we're gonna have a blast.
I'mnotexcitedfor the runway show.
No, I'm terrified.
I'm thinking, like, that I could have made this work but instead
I just let him take over and we're in trouble.
Herewego .
[Overlapping chatter]
Where'smybigleopardbag?
Thankyou,Tim.
Ooh!
Wehavethishugeevent, bigger than actually I think any of us really thought it was going to be, and it's all taking place in battery park.
It still does not feel real.
Ihaveto saythatifIhad to have my show out in the middle of New York Harbor, I'd be a little nervous.
I'mjustoverjoyedbythis , being outdoors as well as all the press and it being the first time this has ever happened, everything is just exhilarating.
Andrightdownhere.
Behindthestageatthe runway show, it's just madness.
Backstage,I 'mpanicked.
After seeing all the fans and press and seeing my garment, I just fell apart.
I'mdisappointedthatI didn't make anything.
Butlisten,it 'sa collaboration between the two of you and you're responsible for the entire look.
We do the best we can under the conditions.
We do the best we can, all right?
IfeellikeI'm not evena designer right now.
I'm just, like, really disappointed.
Don'tbe.
No, you're gonna be fine.
Comingupon Project
Runway...
It'ssounbelievablytacky.
Itlookslikeabadcostume.
Andthenthehairiscrazy !
Westillhavetoknow , though, who is responsible for this mess.
Hi,everybody.
[Cheering]
It's been my dream to do this show once outside in front of all of our fans.
Thank you very much for coming, everybody.
[Cheering]
This is our first Project Runway live show outside, and we're very excited.
These are all of our new designers.
Welcome.
[Cheering]
Our judges--fashion designer
Michael Kors.
[Cheering]
And of course the lovely Nina
Garcia.
[Cheering]
And our guest judge today, Kim
Kardashian.
Welcome.
[Cheering]
Okay, everybody, enjoy the show.
[Cheering]
Ifeelreallyproudtobe seeing my garment on my model.
It's just a surreal moment for me, and I hope that it's the first of many to come.
Shelookslikeabedazzled
Spanish matador.
I mean, yeah, it was a little showy, but I thought it was appropriate for the event.
[Cheering]
It'sbiganddramatic,but the stilt models really freak me out.
They look like aliens or something.
Ihaveafeelingofregret that I was encumbered with
Viktor.
If I'd been by myself, my design would have been amazing in this setting, and I believe it would have been a knockout.
[Cheers and applause]
I'mexcitedbutalsoworried, because I wasn't so confident in what we had done.
Had we finished that bodice, we would have had a really cute look.
Now I'm just kind of worried about it.
I'mthinking,it 'samateur hour.
We both feel that we are gonna be on the chopping block.
I'm, like, super emotional right now.
[Cheering]
Mymodelwasalittleawkward in her walking.
It's just really strange, but she was wearing borrowed stilts.
Maybe that had something to do with it.
I'mverypleasedwithour look and I think it will go over really well.
The only think I would change is the pointed collar that Becky put on the shoulder pad.
I told her that it was too Star
Trek looking, but I think we fulfilled the challenge.
[Cheering]
Ithinkit 'saverycool garment, but if we could have speeded things up, we probably could have done a better job.
I'mpleasedthatitlooks beautiful but I really feel that this could have been super dynamic.
Regardless of how simple the dress is, it's still a pretty sight.
[Cheering]
I'mthinking,like,thisis beautiful.
The pants and the top fit perfectly, and they're flowing beautifully.
But then, when you get up to the hair, we were like, uh-oh.
Shelooksgreat.
You couldn't see any resemblance of a stilt in there, and I was afraid of that.
But I know that they are gonna hit me hard with the hairstyling.
It's just traumatic.
[Cheering]
IreallythinkthatAnthony and I have a really good chance in having the winning design.
It's chic, it's Parisian couture, just like Tim said, but yet it's got drama involved.
The charmeuse skirt is flying, the pants look beautiful and full.
It's just perfect.
I'msuperproudofjust what
Laura and I have accomplished.
Ours is definitely the wow dress.
I'm amazed at how the fabric just went.
It's just phenomenal.
[Cheers and applause]
[Applause]
Didyouenjoyshowingoff your work to a live audience today?
Verymuch.
Weexpectedto see show-stopping garments today, and we were very impressed by some of your designs, but others didn't do as well as we expected.
The winner of this challenge will receive immunity and cannot be eliminated for next week.
Olivier, you won the last challenge, so today you cannot be eliminated.
We scored your designs as they came down the runway.
One of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
Olivier, Anya, your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Anthony, Laura, Danielle,
Cecilia, Kimberly, Becky, your teams had the highest scores.
Yes.
JoshuaandJulie,Bertand
Viktor, Fallene and Bryce, your teams had the lowest scores.
We're going to talk to the team with the highest scores first and then we'll bring you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Itwasamess.
It really was a mess, I'm sorry to say this.
I feel like ours is--they're gonna say harsh things.
Well,here'sthefunnything.
If you look at it, costume, costume, costume.
Yeah.
Who'sontherunway?
Ready to wear, ready to wear, ready to wear.
Itjustfeelsveryhorrible, the wait, like somebody punched you in the stomach and threw you down on the stage.
Anthony,Laura,tellusabout your look.
Wedecidedon thecolorred.
You know, we wanted a wow.
Carla was gonna just, when she walked out, it was like, whoa.
Ilikedit alot .
I think it was dramatic enough.
I loved all those little pieces.
You know, you can always tell when designers do that, it means so much work.
I guess most people probably think it's just, like, thrown on there and glued together.
Ididnothand-sewanyof that.
It is all with a hot glue gun.
ScrapwhatIsaidbefore.
[Laughter]
Well...
Ilovedthislook.
I love that color.
I love the detailing of the little black belt.
This looked so elegant, not costumey at all.
It looks amazing.
Ireallylikethis.
I thought it was very beautiful, the way it flowed and the way the wind made it move was beautiful.
My only worry--and Anthony, we've had this on two occasions with you--is it's a little referential to me.
It looks like something that
I've seen, so please try to be original when you design.
But other than that, it is absolutely beautiful.
Ithinkthetrickiestthing to do is, if you scaled it down and she wasn't on stilts, would it still be fabulous?
And I think it would still be fabulous.
Butwhotakesmore responsibility for this gorgeous look?
Well,I toldherbeforewe got here, I was like, if we get up there, I want you to take it.
That'snice.
All right, Danielle, Cecilia, tell us about your look.
Itreflectsverymuchwhat we do.
Uh, we wanted to create elegance.
So,whodidwhatexactly?
Whenwesawthe stiltwalkers,
I instantly thought of doing a huge sleeve, so I was really married to the blouse idea and then Cecilia came up with the pants.
Ilikethislook.
I like the blouse.
I like the color combination.
I like the brown pants and I like the way you constructed them.
I like the sheerness, that you can see through.
I think that's very nice.
What ruins it for me is her head.
Thehairis crazy!
I mean, my God!
Ilovethislook.
I think this is so chic, and I love bling, and I do love that detailing, and I think the thing that stood out to me the most was just that color, I think, is so rich.
Thankyou.
Thankyou,Kim.
It'sa veryprettyoutfit.
Ithoughtyoupickeda beautiful fabric, but it's about drama, and it's too quiet.
Listen,youpickedthe trickiest fabric in the world.
I mean, chiffon, and to do it impeccably is--it takes so much time.
Wewereverycomfortable using chiffon, which everybody thought it was a bit crazy, given the restraint on time.
Mm-hmm.
Anditwasactuallyacrazy idea.
Becauseyoucandoa chiffon pant like that and make someone just look like a mess, and she doesn't.
KimberlyandBecky,tellus about your look.
Weknewinstantlywhenwegot our model that we wanted to do something edgy.
We wanted to play on each other's strengths.
So she's strong in jackets.
I like structure, so I wanted to do a tailored pant.
Iwasveryimpressedwhen I saw this outfit.
You tailored the pants and it still is a showstopper because it is so sharp, because it is almost perfect.
Thankyou.
Ithinkyouguysarekick-ass tailors.
I mean, you really cut a mean pant.
Thankyou.
Thanks.
Thankyou.
It'llmakeeverywomanwho wants to wear it want to get that tattoo.
[Laughter]
You need the tattoo.
Ilovethepants.
Oh,thankyou.
Lovethepants.
My only detail that I feel could have been edited is that half-collar.
It just looks a little circusy.
But all in all, it was one of my favorite looks too.
Thankyou.
Nowwe'regoingtotalk to the designers with the lower scores.
Thank you very much.
You can leave the runway.
Bert, Viktor, tell us about your look.
Ichosethebottompart 'cause I wanted it to be a little bit more modern and thin.
And Bert chose the top part.
We did--had our little struggles, and we did--had miscommunications and things like that.
Tome,it 'slikethe wallpaper and curtains at a really tacky catering hall.
Mm-hmm.
Ihatethatdustruffleof gold on the top of it.
It's just, it's really old.
It'salmostlikeinthemovie
The Sound of Music, when they took the drapes off and made their clothes, but like Marie
Antoinette days.
It really does look like curtains.
Ithinkit lookslikeabad costume.
It's terrible.
Idon'tbelievethatthis was what I wanted to present.
Soyouthinkit'shis responsibility.
Ididn'tcreatethis.
Okay.
Viktor, what do you think?
Iownit .
I think we both worked at it at the end and we finished it and--
Sowhenyousay ,"Iownit,"
it means that it was your idea.
Imean,Iown the workwith him because we both did very much 50-50.
"Iownit "?
50-50 is not "I own it."
No,like,no ,notown it.
I guess I'm being responsible for it.
Sothatmeansifthis outfit today is the worst look, you would be the one to go home?
Oh,no.
[Laughs]
No, no.
Well,then,that'snot owning it.
Bert,you'returningslightly lobster color.
Oh,amI?
Sorry.
He was very emphatic about, "I want to do this, we need to do a
Victorian," and I found it unusual that he wouldn't sketch.
He said, "Well, you sketch it.
You sketch better."
Whywouldyounot sketch something?
No,I-I--no,Idid sketch.
No,youtoldme, "Bert,you sketch, you sketch."
It'sinmy HP computer.
Itseemslikeyou two had a lovely day yesterday.
Yes.
Allright,fromone strange look to the next, Fallene and
Bryce, tell us about your outfit.
Ihadtheidea,becausewe were working with such long legs, that we could do a really, really big, kind of full tulle skirt and then we were gonna have cute little details up on the top.
Butliterally,yougavehera
Black Swan.
Yeah.
Idon'tgetit.
Thishasno effortput into it.
It does look like just a tank top that I wear to bed and it looks like a tie wrapped around the waist a couple times.
This just looks like you could have done this in 15 minutes.
Youknow,Ithinktheidea had so much promise.
However, there's nothing.
There's no detail.
It's just the beginning of something.
It's--it's--likeyousaid, it's, like, half done.
Soit'slikenonedone ,then .
Yeah.
Iloveherheadpiece.
I think the headpiece is nice.
Well,I 'msogladImade something.
Ithinktheheadpieceis great.
Listen, to me, it's like she's got every dance reference and it ends up just looking like nothing because they don't meld.
SoBryce,if thiswas the worst look, who do you think should go home?
Um,I thinkbothofus.
I think that--I think this was a team effort.
Unfortunately,itwouldbe only one.
IthinkIshouldbeableto stay.
I did my best.
Iwouldsaymyself.
IwouldsayFallene.
Josh,Julie,tellusabout your look.
Well,I cameup withthe concepts.
Andtheconceptwas circus?
No,itwasmatador.
Ole,ole,ole!
I mean, guys, you know, drama doesn't mean tacky.
Spanishmatador,youcan be inspired by that, you know, and that could be really chic.
You know, we've seen it.
Ijustthinkit'syetanother
Halloween costume.
It's the weirdest hybrid I've ever heard of.
Andshe'sgotthesetiny arms and these extremely long legs.
[Laughter]
It gives her a very bizarre-- when she walked out, I was like, huh.
Forget the matador, circus, and all that.
Theonlypositivethingthat
I could say about this outfit is, it looks well made.
Iagree.
Imean,it is sharp.
That it is, definitely.
So if we decide that this is the worst look for today, who should go home?
Well,itwasmyidea ,andI 'm not gonna throw Josh under the bus.
Whatdoyouthink,Josh ?
Iwouldhopenot togohome, and I would not choose myself.
Soyou'resayingyou would choose Julie.
Yes,I wouldchooseJulie.
Okay,sowe 'veheardwhat you had to say.
We're gonna have a little chat and then I'll call you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Thankyou.
Let'stalkaboutthe designs and the designers that we did like today.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Thegarmentreallylooked modern, dramatic, exciting.
Well,itwasthe rightchoice of color, it was the right way to do the pants, and it still looks like a gown.
Ithoughtit wasbeautifulon the model wearing stilts, and I could picture it on a woman without the stilts.
Thatwaspretty.
Then we have Danielle and
Cecilia.
Ihappenedto likethat outfit.
I think it's just really chic.
Andthebeadingwas beautiful.
Theplushereistotakethat chiffon and make something that is finished beautifully.
The chiffon, if you make a mistake, she's in a rag.
DanielleandCecilia,they both know how to sew.
Oh,yeah.
Theydo.
Yousawit here.
BeckyandKimberly.
Thesimpletruthis, they sent out something impeccably tailored.
The pants were fantastic.
Andtheproportionswere right.
Yes.
Italsodidn'tlooklike two designers did something and they stuck it together.
Butrealistically,theyhad a very cohesive look.
Yeah,I thoughtthatit looked like it was done by one person.
Metoo.
Let'stalkaboutthe designers that we didn't like.
Even though it was Julie's idea to make this circus matador outfit, I can still see Josh's bedazzling in there.
They'reanoddteam,when you think about Julie and Josh.
Julie is, you know, rocky, you know, mountain woman, and Josh is like, bedazzle it, glamorous, and kind of those two things together ended up with this insane, very tacky matador outfit.
Yeah.
Youareadesigner.
You're selling design, you're selling taste.
Imean,therewas likeso many details, you didn't know where to look.
It was crazy.
Bryce and Fallene.
Yougetto theBlackSwan /Bob
Fosse combo.
I mean, the hat was the only thing that had any bit of charm or, I don't know, personality.
Itlookedliketwo different eras.
It was like showgirl hat, ballerina--I--you know, it didn't go together at all.
Yeah.
Dance hall girl, modern dance, and ballet, all combined.
What if they hadn't had-- aninspiration.
There was nothing.
It was a promise of an idea, but they couldn't deliver anything.
I mean, I'm not defending Bryce, but I think at least he's got a little more spunk.
Buttheonlythingthat we did like was the hat, and she made the hat.
Ifthehatwasn'tthere,you really would have fallen asleep.
ViktortotallythrewBert under the bus.
He didn't really say it, but he did.
Well,BertthrewViktorunder the bus too.
IjustthinkthatViktoris full of it, and he just--
Idotoo.
Youknow,IbelieveBert when he says he didn't do a drawing and all of that stuff.
Shouldn'tBerthavesaid,
"You know what?
I think this thing is not working."
It's ugly drapes.
I mean, they're ugly drapes.
Awfulfabric.
Everythingbadin thehouse on your body.
Sowe'vemadeour decision?
Okay, let's bring them back out.
Your teams represent the highest and the lowest scores.
One designer will be the winner of this challenge and one designer will be out.
AnthonyRyanandLaura,you two did a great job.
Laura, congratulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
[Applause]
That means that you have immunity next time.
Anthony Ryan, we think that you also did a great job.
Laura and Anthony Ryan, you can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
Winningisawesome,but it's also wonderful winning with such a great partner that was so gracious.
Oh!
I knewit .
[Applause]
So who won?
Idid.
Oh!
Congratulations.
Thankyou.

[Laughs]

Both:
Thankyou.
Josh,Julie,you'rein.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyouverymuch.
Thank you.
Bert,Viktor,youhaveto remember that dramatic does not mean costumey.
Your fabric choice was so very wrong that almost anything that you would have done with it would have been bad.
Bert, you're in.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
BryceandFallene,yourlook was boring ballerina.
It looked like there was no effort put into it.
Bryce, you're in.
You can leave the runway.

Iwasn'treadyfor Joshto go.
He has so much talent, and there's people like Fallene that don't even know really what their direction is at this point.
She talks to much about being a hairstylist, I'm not even sure if she's a designer, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Oh,man.
I'm just freakin' nervous for today.
I'm like, maybe I'm too much of a normal person.
I never thought I would be normal, but...

He is just saying the wrong things at the wrong time.
It annoys me.

"Oh, gee, look who I'm stuck with."
I don't appreciate it, and I don't think it's professional.

There'sa bigbull's-eyeon the two of us.
Forthefirsttimeever on
Project Runway, your fashion show will take place outside, in front of a live audience and the press.
Whoa.
I got goosebumps.
Just the bigness of it is very, very exciting to me.
Soyourjobistomakesure that your look will stand out...
But be in at the same time.
Good luck, everybody.
And we all will see you on the outdoor runway.
Let's go, girls.
Bye, guys!
All:

Okay.
Whoo!
Ireallylikecolor.
And I really like pattern.
Ithinkof crazythings sometimes.
You know, obviously, sometimes-- no,yeah,keepgoing.
Youknow?
Talktome ,becauseifyou talk and I can draw-- butsometimes,we canhave them like they're coming out of something, you know?
Right.
Iwasthinkingmorelike old
Hollywood.
Something more classic, so...
MaeWest?
Yeah,like,evenMae West.
Exactly.
Like it's a--it's-- you can make it have pants.
MaeWestneverworepants.
Her entire life.
No, she didn't.
She wore skirts.
Bertistoodefensive.
He needs to calm down.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Howexcitedareyou about this challenge?
It's completely thrilling.
I want you to think about a couple of things.
Think about Paris Couture Week.
It causes you to question what's real and what isn't.
Very much like this challenge.
I'm always looking at fashion illustrations, which I happen to love, but I always say, "These aren't real women."
Well, for this challenge, they are.
Everyonealwayssaysthat when I draw my fashion figures, they're so, like, long.
It's kind of like our fashion illustrations get to come to life.
It's a pretty exciting challenge, I think, for all the designers.
Iambringinginyour stilt walker models.
You will have 30 minutes to consult with them as a team.
We're going shopping at Mood, and each team will have a budget of $500.
Whoo!
Andyouhaveone day for this challenge.
So it's today.
Noway.
Way.
Areyoucrazy?
SoI 'msendingin your models.
Have fun!
Doesithavetobepants ?
Iwouldimagine.
Probably.
Sothatyoucan-- thedresswouldget tangled.
Yeah,yeah.
That'd be a disaster.
Oh,great,Ihavenevereven talked to her.
She's never really talked to me.
But we agreed on kind of a look and a style, and realized, "Oh, she makes great pants."
And I make great tailored jackets, so...
That's what we're doing.
Yes.
Hey,ladies.
Over here.
Hi,howareyou ?
Sithere.
Okay.
Icancrouchall the way down to, like...
Like that, or-- whataboutsleeves?
Does that bother you?
Howisit ,walkingin something...
Long and full?
Itisimportantthatit's not below where my feet fasten into my stilts.
Whereyourstiltis.
Becauseitcausesyou to tumble.
Ourinspirationforthis design, we're thinking Parisian couture.
Just a really flattering silhouette, and not make her look like she's in the circus, walking down a runway.
Theway--I'mthinkingdrapey.
Okay,realdrapey.
Okay.
I'mthinkinglikethis.
Butthinkcircus-ytoo .
Oh,I--Iam .
Like, think about it moving back behind her.
Like, it's gonna be like flowing and moving.
So Fallene and I know that we want to do a big, full skirt.
And we're inspired by our model.
She has been a ballerina forever.
She's got tattoos, funky hair.
We definitely want to go with this kind of dark ballerina.
KindoflikeQueenVictoriaa little bit, like, just...
Oh,that'sverygood.
Alittlebitbig here.
Nice, big, like, open here.
But maybe a big collar.
But it's sexy here.
Uh-huh.
QueenVictoriawasin mourning for 50 years.
I don't think that's a sexy direction I would like to go into.
Ifyoudo adressthat 'slike a bust like here, her boobs are gonna be showing like this.
That'snotVictorian.
That's Elizabethan.
Well,whatever.
Well,there'sadifference.
Bertisaknow-it-all.
He's just very obnoxious.
Viktorreallyneedstodoa little bit of book reading.
Designers...
Say good-bye to your models.
They will be back later today for a fitting.
Bye!
Thankyou,ladies.
All right, let's head out to our first trip to Mood.
So follow me.
Design teams, here we go.
Your 30 minutes begins...
Right now.
Alittlebithere,here , here, and more here, and then boom.
Viktor.
Bert,darling.
Whereareyou?
Whereareyou?
Backhere.
Look.
Follow my voice.
Iwantto to ,like,akimono with this, and then have big sleeves, and not go-- sobigsleevesmeancouture?
I literally had to bite my tongue.
How much training do you have in couture?
What'sthis?
Ourgameplanistojustpull every red shade that we like.
We have our grocery list.
So it's just a matter of executing it.
Yeah,I likethispattern better.
Butasfarasthat ,Ifeel like it should be more modern.
Areyoutwoall right?
Yes,we'regreat.
Okay.
You're kind of a dream team.
So...
We'rehavingagoodtime .
Wehavehighexpectations.
Iwaslookingforwardtoa team challenge, and to have one with Oliver, it is a dream.
Canthisbe pleated?
Ugh.
Julie,anythingin lifecan be pleated.
She was rockin' my nerves.
Ooh,I likethetextureof this.
Chiffon is the lightest of all the fabrics you can grab.
It's like this...
Of silk.
So I think it'd be cool to do something that's almost a muted, like, really muted polka dot.
This is way too -- insteadofthedenim?
Yeah.
Okay,gofindit.
I'mnotsettlingfor all black.
We're not creating a freakin' gothic...stilt walker.
Youhavetwominutes remaining.
Oh!
Okay.
Soweneedtohurryup.
Yes,weneedtohurryup.
Thankyou.
Thereisnothinglikeit,so
I'm just grabbing anything.
Geta lotof it .
Allright,designers.
Time is up.
Design teams at the register.
Anya, you're walking the wrong way.
So let's head back to Parsons.
Thank you, Mood!
All:
Thankyou!
Hey.
Yeah,let'snotfocussomuch on this.
Well,that'spartofthe dress.
I'mnotsayingwe're building a-- no,I 'mnotdisagreeingwith anything you're saying, though.
Ijustwanttomake sure we know what we're going as far as units.
We've agreed on the silhouette.
It's going to be a strapless bustier piece, and then there'll be this full skirt.
MayI haveyourattention, just for a moment?
You have until 9:00 tonight.
All right, work hard.
I will see you later.
Thank you.
Doyoufeelcomfortable making very well-fitting pants?
I'mcomfortablewithpattern making, so...
Okay,foryour...
Otherlooks, were you happy with the fit?
Lady,I makecustom-made clothing for people with all kind of bodies.
I know how to fit pants.
YouknowthatIwantedthe other prints, right?
Like a more modern print.
They might say it might be dated, 'cause it's a little bit too flowery.
It's gonna be definitely a challenge to work with that ugly fabric.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
Ithinkthisfabricis genius.
Assoonas he foundthe fabric, I knew the idea.
Josh and myself are doing a romantic matador stilt walker.
Imean,youcoloredit,not me.
Butifyoudon 'tput it underneath the whole dress and the jacket, then you're gonna-- it's gonna be messy.
Whatdoyoumean,messy?
Ithoughttheshapewas supposed to be kind of roundish.
Ifeelthisdirectionwe're taking is absolutely wrong.
It's not what we need to be presenting in 2011.
Whydon'tyoufinishthis , since you have the whole idea?
No,I don'thavethe whole idea.
This is a design that we're working on together.
No,I know.
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying--no, no, no.
You need to hold on.
You need to hold on.
Letmefinish.
I'llbeback.
Okay,youcomeback.
Ican'tdealwithyou.
It's like you act like a small kid, like, you--you don't let me talk.
No,' causeyou'regetting confused.
No,it'snotaquestion.
It's not a question.
It was a comment.
Okay,well,I'mmakinga statement.
Saveitforthe judge.
He's, like, so immature.
He's like a 57-year-old kid.
It's only his way or the highway.
It's kind of difficult to make sense with somebody who's crazy.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
We'reallfeelingtense.
Anyone could go down because of their teammate.
That'sveryimmature.
What'simmatureis you'renot letting me finish.
What was that about?
What?
What are you talking about?
I just think he kind of just gets defensive right away.
And it's unnecessary.
He'sshakingin hisboots.
He doesn't have immunity this time.
Here'stheskirt.
And I was just saying, like, since you have the idea how you're doing this-- that'sfine,butyou switched fabrics on us a couple times.
It'smostlyyourdesign.
I'm just kind of following you.
No,itisn't.
Butwecouldgoonandon and talk about-- no,I 'mjustgettingthat-- clarifying what I understood we said in the store.
Okay,so,youwanttotalk- - thatwasmy understanding.
Well, no, but it...
Bertwillfightyou on anything, even if there is nothing to fight about.
Idon'twanttodebatethat.
I just wanna do this.
MaybeI do.
That'sveryimmature.
No,it'snot.
What's immature is you're not letting me finish.
Okay,it's--letme hearyou .
That'sallI'msaying.
Youknow,Idon 'tknowwhat
Bert has in his mind.
I almost feel like he does things on purpose to sabotage me, or maybe it's a strategy.
I don't--I have no idea.
Working,working,working, working.
Thehardestpartofdesigning a garment for a stilt walker is figuring out how to make her look as chic as possible, and also to make it safe.
Yeah,butthisiswhat I'm envisioning.
Fullness, we want at the bottom.
So we need a hoop, right?
Right.
Laura and I agree on making a cage for a big hoop skirt.
Almost like an old Alabama plantation girl.
Thiswillbe an old petticoat?
Yes.
Just allow for some volume on the bottom to get that dramatic effect, but so it didn't get caught under the model's stilts.
So I'm cutting all this boning and gluing and circles.
And...
A lot of math.
Teamwork.
Whatdoyouthink the color should be?
Well,justsomethinghigh around the neck.
Either wrapping or, like-- we want dramatic.
Ithink,whenitcomesto group challenge, it's not about how brilliant or how amazing you can do by yourself.
It's much more about the collaboration and communication between the two people.
No,I wannado ,like,a little bullfighter jacket.
But--but the sleeves so you can hold it and be, like...
Right.
Doesthatmakesense?
And then, if you made a bustier-- but,like,doesthatmake sense?
Doesthatmakesense?
Doyouneedtopoke me?
Quit poking me.
You're like a poker and a puncher.
You're such a rough chick.
I'mthemanhere.
MeandJuliecouldbasically flop genders.
Soonceyoumakethis pattern, you think you can base all the other ones off of this, right?
Yeah.
Okay,good.
A lot of teams thought that we were crazy for working with chiffon.
And, yeah, it's a little bit of a risk.
Okay.
Mostdesignersconsider chiffon difficult.
Danielle and I are very comfortable with those fabrics.
And we love how it flows and how it moves.
The thing about Becky's personality is I really can't read it.
She stares a lot.
She just stares.
So you just wonder what's going through her mind.
What?
What?
I think we're all feeling tense because anyone could go down because of their teammate.
So it's not just about one person anymore.
So it's anybody's game today.
Youmakingagianttutu ?
Yeah.
Awesome.
Beckysoundedscaredwhenshe said that.
"You're making a black tutu?"
You were in the bottom last time, right?
It'sprettyimportantfor me and Bryce to do well.
We were both in the bottom, and we both got paired up together.
Weneedto havesomething that is a thin line between costume and fashion.
Bryce,I justwanttolook at this real quick with you.
This bodice with that is, like, pretty blah.
And I really feel like that turquoise as a waistband would-- no.
Why?
Absolutelynot.
Whynot?
Dude,it'stoomuch.
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
This is way too much pop.
No, I am not doing the turquoise.
Okay.
Bryceistakingoverallthe control, so I'm feeling like I can't have any input because he'll probably bite my head off.
Justgetthebodicedone first, and then we'll worry about this stuff later.
Okay.
Ithinkhe trustsmewith the style that I'm doing.
Yeah.
Yeah,yeah.
WorkingwithJoshisactually surprisingly really smooth.
Wasthisateamchallenge?
'CauseI 'mworkingalone.
No,whereis she?
It'sfine.
It's quiet over here.
Ooh,dramaon 34thstreet.
Soa couplehoursintothis challenge, Anthony's been trying to make this cage that we had a great idea for.
Thisisliterallygonnatake hours.
I mean, what do you think about that?
'Causeifyouthinkthis isn't working, we can't spend any time on it.
Thisisn'tgonnawork.
Okay.
Problemsolved.
Weneedto scratchitand move forward.
Soitmightjustlook awesome, because then we have to put the pants everywhere.
Allthelayers,yeah.
Kimberly,whatdo youthink?
I have a collar on here.
Uh...
Ithinkit 'snottoo
Star Trek-y, it's, uh--
Ithinkwe definitelyneed something here.
You know, everybody's going big and elaborate;
We gotta-- getsomesparkle.
Wegottagetsomething.
KimberlyandIare getting along fine.
But I wasn't gonna let her put gold lame on that thing.
Sorry.
Gross.
Ijustwanttomake sure that...
I'm, like, cutting it on the right grain.
I feel like I am, though.
Well,youshouldbematching it, sweetheart.
Any piece of fabric, you have threads that are going this way and threads that are going this way.
So you should have your grain on your drape.
Right,yeah.
It'sreallyimportanttoline up your fabric on grain, meaning grain line that matches up with this thread.
If it doesn't, then it can skew the whole thing.
Yeah,youneedtobecareful.
'Cause it's--if it gets off grain, you're screwed.
Okay.
Ijustgotout ofschool,so it's all fresh in my head.
Did you ever go to school?
No.
Youneverwenttoschool?
Hm-mmm.
Oh.
Fallene has no training.
She is self-taught.
And I'm worried about that.
IfeellikeIhave toconfirm everything with you right now, because I'm totally lost.
No,ifit makesyou feel good, I don't mind being comforting.
Ijustcouldnot see the grain line on that fabric.
Oh, God.
I'm glad we have a good relationship, Bryce.
Shedidn'tknowhow to cut it on-grain.
What?
Ongrain.
Sodidshe,like,take the fabric and was like, "wah!"
It'sjustadifferenceof being self-taught and going to school.
She'strying,but...
Right.
I'vebeenturningintothe boss.
Whichthenwillput alotof responsibility on your shoulders, though.
'Cause then, at the end, if it comes down to they still didn't like it, then they're like,
"Well, who led?"
It's hard.
Hello,designers!
All:
Hi,Tim.
JoshuaandJulie.
Hi,Tim.
Howareyouall ?
We'redefinitelyhelpingeach other out, and I think our styles will collide.
Collide...
Orconverge?
Both:
Converge.
Okay.
Ithinkwe 'll...
They'vecollidedalittle bit, but...
We'regonnago forthis little Spanish feel.
She'sa bullfighter?
Both:
Yes.
Ole!
Pshew!
Juliehasbeenworkingon that jacket forever.
Butit'scute.
Lookatthisbeautiful...
Wefoundthisgreatfabric.
And I think it's gonna create like a great--
Ithinkit 'ssmashing.
Smashing.
IloveJoshuaM's pants.
It reminds me of Beetlejuice.
Carryon.
Appreciateit.
CeceliaandDanielle,how are you doing?
Good.
We're doing sort of a tailored blouse with a teal chiffon with a big, huge, billowy sleeve.
Okay.
Andtheseareour fabrics.
We're using a lot of materials that we both like.
Sowhenshewalks,youknow, these sleeves will billow back.
And it's all about movement.
Yeah.
Well,it'sallaboutthe proportion of the bottom garment to the top garment.
And it just needs--needs to work.
Theproportionsareso different, we are unfamiliar with how this look will fit.
ViktorandBert.
Talk to me.
Iguesswe wantedtostart with a bodice and do something very tight.
And also, a little bit of structure, just to create the drama.
Drama'simportant.
But this isn't intended to be a costume.
No,no.
No .
GoodLord.
That thing is ghastly.
Ithinkhe wasthinkingof doing it this way, and I was thinking of doing it the other way.
Iwantedto do acontemporary look, and he was at, "Well, I really think we should do this."
And I had some other ideas, and, no, this is what we have to do.
No,that'snottrue.
Whenever I suggest, "that doesn't work;
Maybe we could do something like this," and automatically, he goes, "That's not gonna work.
This won't work."
So right now, I'm in the point where I'm just kind of trying to get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtrying-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Areyouworried?
It's nerve-racking, because this thing might fall apart.
No,no,likethis.
I mean, this is up because I listened to you.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
I'mjustkindoftryingto get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtryingto-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
CanI tellyouwhatconcerns me about our conversation?
I don't think I've heard either of you say "We."
This has to be a "We."
Yeah.
Itneedsto be .
Yeah.
Well,earlier,he said,
"This is your design," and I said, "No, it's not."
No,I didn'tsaythat.
Youdid.
Whateveryou'regoingtodo, you need to do it now.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Wow, color.
Red.
Red.
When you said "Paris," that's the big key word, that did it for me, having that dramatic feel to it.
Theseshoulderpadsare very on trend for fall.
We'remakingtheskirtoutof this.
Then we're lining it with the charmeuse that we made these out of, so I'm-- andyoufeelyou can control this well enough?
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, if you can pull this off, I think it's a wow moment.
That'swhatwe wantto hear, right?
Yeah.
Becky and Kimberly.
Beckykindof thoughtof military, and I kind of was like punk, which the model was totally for and about.
Andshehasatattooonher collarbone.
Mm-hmm.
Andsowe wentwitha one-shoulder so we could see this great tattoo over here.
Oh.
Ijustmadethe greensleeve and now I'm gonna make one in the stripe to see which one we like better.
I'mhopingthatthisworksin the stripe.
Yeah.
You'veworkedwelltogether?
Yeah.
She makes good pants, I make good jackets.
We divide and conquer.
Great.
Thankyou.
Thanks,Tim.
IfeellikeIhave ablack cloud over me.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
How are you feeling?
I--I'mgood.
I'm-- youare?
I'mjustworriedit'sgetting too big.
Heidi said, "Go big."
I was gonna keep going.
This is my gut telling me to stop.
Youlistento yourgut , both of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatisthistextilebeing used for?
Um,sothisisgonnabethe bodice.
I liked the polka dot because I felt that it gave some color and some pop, which is me.
Rightnow,Ireallywant
Fallene to get this bodice done so that we can worry about the pants.
Okay,go.
Go ,go ,go .
Thankyou.
AnyaandOlivier.
I'd love to hear what you're doing.
Well,theideawas ,uh, because Olivier's really menswear and I do womens wear, we have this polar opposite way of working and way of seeing things.
Ithinkthismakesyoua great team.
Yeah,andso it 'sgonnahave this tight feeling of, like, things holding her.
Uh-huh.
Andthisgoingontopof this.
I'llbeblunt.
I think it's unexpected.
Timseemsalittlethrownoff by our fabric selections.
Maybe he just doesn't know how to say, "I don't like it."
Bye,everybody.
Bye, Tim.
Havea goodnight.
Thanks.
Youtoo.
Bertzilla.
Bertzilla,yousaid?
Yeah.
Isthatmy newname?
I'mgonnacutthissoit won't be boggy.
Yeah,yeah,cool.
Unlessyouwantthat.
No,it'scool.
Beautiful.
Timdidmentionall heheard was "I, I, I," which is true, but I am willing to just start again, like, leave that behind and enjoy the moment.
Becauseofthat,thisis taking forever.
I'm sorry.
Justgetit done.
Iwill.
IthinkBryceand Falleneare in trouble because even though they have this great, voluminous tutu that's really impressive looking, there's nothing else that they have.
And I know Fallene's having trouble getting the bodice done.
Isitalmostdone?
It'sdone,butwhatelse do we need to sew?
ThecincherthatIwasgonna have you do, it's basically here's the two pieces together.
I'm showing Julie a quick and effective way to get a ruching effect for the waistband.
Leave these two ends open and stitch this one side down.
And then you're gonna have to grab this.
Oh,yeah,yeah.
Bringitallthe way overto here, and then it's all gonna shrink into itself and it's just gonna make, like, a great cover belt.
Perfect.
I'minsuchbad shapewith this.
We don't have time.
No,golikethis,golike this.
Here.
Go just like-- no,no.
Likethis.
Imadethisisedup because I listened to you.
No, I really don't care about anymore.
I'll make interfacing.
I'm sorry.
Itiswhatitis,Danielle.
Attheendofthenight ,I'm already concerned because it's a one-day challenge and chiffon takes double the time.
Hello.
Thisisso weird.
Howdoyouput pantson?
Pantsfirst,thenstilts.
I'venever,like-- neverhemmedagiantbefore.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
It's like Alice in Wonderland.
Thisisafantasy.
It's not a costume, okay?
That's the word.
It's fantasy.
Howlongdo we have?
Ten minutes?
Whyareyouworried?
Well,I wantto seeitcome together.
Nowitlookslikeamess.
Yeah.
Oh,myGod.
It's gonna come out okay.
Doyouhaveabodicetofit on her?
Yeah.
Oh,good.
Holdthatand,like...
Is it?
I'll re-cut it.
I know, it's--it's looking weird.
It'soff-grain.
It'slookingweird.
.
Okay.
Once I put the bodice onto her,
I thinking, oh, why is this all wonky?
And didn't even realize that I didn't cut it on-grain.
I just feel like I can't do simple things right now 'cause
I'm, like, so tired and on edge.
WhenFallenecutsthe bodice off-grain, it's a big deal, and you have to immediately re-cut.
I'm worried that she won't have enough time to do something like that.
I just--I don't know how this is gonna go.
Seeyoutomorrow.
Ciao.
Bye.
Itlooksokay.
Actually, this looks nice.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to snap at you, it's just there is no time for getting fancy at this point.
Oh,Bryce.
What happened to me today?
This is really bad.
Ihaveafeelingwe'regonna be in the bottom two or the bottom three.
Itjust--it'sjustreally disappointing.
I let Bryce down 'cause I just could not finish my garment, so it's...
I'm sorry.
It'sokay.
It'sreallygonnalookbad for you.
I'm so sorry.
Allright,guys,let 'smove.
Areyouexcitedfor today?
I'mwonderingwherewe're going.
That's the exciting part.
Ithinkouroutfitlooks good.
Ithinkit looksvery,very good.
It's--it'sdefinitelywhat you and I put together.
IthinknowI'm okaywith it.
Yesterday, I was a little bit hoping for a thunderstorm.
Everyonewasintense yesterday.
Some people here, they can whip up so fast, you know?
Like, I feel like I'm not at that level to do that.
Dothebestyou can .
Just do the best you can.
IwishIhad mysoul right now.
I feel like I'm kind of-- well,maybeyou'llfinditin the workroom today.
Maybe it's sitting under a table just waiting for you.
All right.
Later.
Let'sgo.
Well,sincewe finishedon time, we can chill.
Maybegluesomeofthefabric from here?
Sure.
I'mgonnafigureout whether or not we can do, like, a tube top or something like that.
Westillhavealotofthis left.
I'mnervousaboutwhatpeople are gonna think.
The bodice is cut off-grain, so it's a mess.
We could send it down but I feel like it's too bad.
Brycedecideslastminuteto just put together a tube top, and I just let him take over at that point.
Falleneissweet.
Bryce really pushed her around a bit.
He's very sort of a bossy kid.
Oh,youchangedthe top ?
Itwasnotcut on-grain.
Oh,right.
Like,itlookedlikeitwas melting or something awful.
Ithinkthatlooks--that'll look nice.
Yeah.
Okay, we're done talking about it.
It needs to be sewn, because this jacket has taken you over
12 hours and-- itlooksgreat.
Oh,Julie.
Oh!
Oh,Julie.
Didyou--didyou--didyou manage to stitch some of the shoulder last night?
No,itwassotighttothe mannequin.
I didn't have time to sew everything perfectly.
It's nerve-racking because I'm worried that this thing might fall apart.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Thisisgoingtobeahugely jam-packed morning.
In an hour and a half, we are leaving the workroom for our outdoor runway.
Ithasn'tbeendoneonthe show before, and to be a part of the first public runway makes me completely speechless.
IfeellikeI'm running around with my head cut off, 'cause I don't think that I'm gonna have enough time to sew up a new top.
Comingupon project runway...
Thehairlookslikea pumpkin.
Iknowwe bothdon 'tthink this is our best work.
We'reheadedto ourfirst outdoor runway ever.
I'msortof freakingout .
No,you'regonnabefine .
Idon'tthinkthere'sany making this attractive.
Son of a bitch.
Bryceiscompletelystressed out, and I felt bad but after seeing what he's producing, I'm sort of freaking out.
Idon'tknow.
Maybe I should put the zip in.
Idon'tfeelthat'sright.
I don't know.
I'mjust--I'mhonestlyso frustrated right now.
I mean, I know we both don't think this is our best work.
Like,ifwe justadd ,like,a couple little-- foryourjacket.
It'smajor.
IfJoshwantstobedazzle,
I'm gonna let him do it.
Wehavealot moretodo-- all the finishing work on the skirt and then attach it to the bodice.
I'm just hoping we have enough time.
IknewIwantedtocreatea headpiece, knowing that this is a team effort and I didn't create anything.
And so I got the red feathers.
I broke 'em up with some of the fabric to kind of bring something interesting to this garment.
It'sbeautiful.
It's really stunning.
ThisistheJoshside .
Andyouseweditbeautifully.
It's sewn beautifully.
With Julie, I knew it could go one of two ways--completely horrible or amazing between both of us, and I think that we're gonna do something that might shock a lot of people.
Designers,I amsendingin your models.
You will have an hour to send your models to the L'Oreal Paris makeup room and the Garnier hair studio.
The Piperlime wall, of course, is important here.
I'm being very strict about the schedule this morning because we have a curtain call, everyone.
Right.
Allright?
Thank you.
Makeitjustatadbit tighter.
Josh,youwanttodomakeup?
I think you're gonna be better at that than I will.
I'llwageryouthat.

I don't want it to look Asian, though.
We'renotgoingtokabuki.

'Cause there's a whole bunch of royalty.

So very dramatic.
Do you think you've got it?
It'skindof vague,but we'll--we'll kind of work with it.
I'msotired.
Oh,no.
That'snotwhattheywant .
Thanksforthat.
Thehairlookslikeahuge pumpkin on her head.
There was nothing we could do at this point because we had to walk out of there.
Designersandmodels,let 's go.
We're headed to our first outdoor runway ever and we're gonna have a blast.
I'mnotexcitedfor the runway show.
No, I'm terrified.
I'm thinking, like, that I could have made this work but instead
I just let him take over and we're in trouble.
Herewego .
Where'smybigleopardbag?
Thankyou,Tim.
Ooh!
Wehavethishugeevent, bigger than actually I think any of us really thought it was going to be, and it's all taking place in battery park.
It still does not feel real.
Ihaveto saythatifIhad to have my show out in the middle of New York Harbor, I'd be a little nervous.
I'mjustoverjoyedbythis , being outdoors as well as all the press and it being the first time this has ever happened, everything is just exhilarating.
Andrightdownhere.
Behindthestageatthe runway show, it's just madness.
Backstage,I 'mpanicked.
After seeing all the fans and press and seeing my garment, I just fell apart.
I'mdisappointedthatI didn't make anything.
Butlisten,it 'sa collaboration between the two of you and you're responsible for the entire look.
We do the best we can under the conditions.
We do the best we can, all right?
IfeellikeI'm not evena designer right now.
I'm just, like, really disappointed.
Don'tbe.
No, you're gonna be fine.
Comingupon Project
Runway...
It'ssounbelievablytacky.
Itlookslikeabadcostume.
Andthenthehairiscrazy !
Westillhavetoknow , though, who is responsible for this mess.
Hi,everybody.
It's been my dream to do this show once outside in front of all of our fans.
Thank you very much for coming, everybody.
This is our first Project Runway live show outside, and we're very excited.
These are all of our new designers.
Welcome.
Our judges--fashion designer
Michael Kors.
And of course the lovely Nina
Garcia.
And our guest judge today, Kim
Kardashian.
Welcome.
Okay, everybody, enjoy the show.
Ifeelreallyproudtobe seeing my garment on my model.
It's just a surreal moment for me, and I hope that it's the first of many to come.
Shelookslikeabedazzled
Spanish matador.
I mean, yeah, it was a little showy, but I thought it was appropriate for the event.
It'sbiganddramatic,but the stilt models really freak me out.
They look like aliens or something.
Ihaveafeelingofregret that I was encumbered with
Viktor.
If I'd been by myself, my design would have been amazing in this setting, and I believe it would have been a knockout.
I'mexcitedbutalsoworried, because I wasn't so confident in what we had done.
Had we finished that bodice, we would have had a really cute look.
Now I'm just kind of worried about it.
I'mthinking,it 'samateur hour.
We both feel that we are gonna be on the chopping block.
I'm, like, super emotional right now.
Mymodelwasalittleawkward in her walking.
It's just really strange, but she was wearing borrowed stilts.
Maybe that had something to do with it.
I'mverypleasedwithour look and I think it will go over really well.
The only think I would change is the pointed collar that Becky put on the shoulder pad.
I told her that it was too Star
Trek looking, but I think we fulfilled the challenge.
Ithinkit 'saverycool garment, but if we could have speeded things up, we probably could have done a better job.
I'mpleasedthatitlooks beautiful but I really feel that this could have been super dynamic.
Regardless of how simple the dress is, it's still a pretty sight.
I'mthinking,like,thisis beautiful.
The pants and the top fit perfectly, and they're flowing beautifully.
But then, when you get up to the hair, we were like, uh-oh.
Shelooksgreat.
You couldn't see any resemblance of a stilt in there, and I was afraid of that.
But I know that they are gonna hit me hard with the hairstyling.
It's just traumatic.
IreallythinkthatAnthony and I have a really good chance in having the winning design.
It's chic, it's Parisian couture, just like Tim said, but yet it's got drama involved.
The charmeuse skirt is flying, the pants look beautiful and full.
It's just perfect.
I'msuperproudofjust what
Laura and I have accomplished.
Ours is definitely the wow dress.
I'm amazed at how the fabric just went.
It's just phenomenal.
Didyouenjoyshowingoff your work to a live audience today?
Verymuch.
Weexpectedto see show-stopping garments today, and we were very impressed by some of your designs, but others didn't do as well as we expected.
The winner of this challenge will receive immunity and cannot be eliminated for next week.
Olivier, you won the last challenge, so today you cannot be eliminated.
We scored your designs as they came down the runway.
One of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
Olivier, Anya, your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Anthony, Laura, Danielle,
Cecilia, Kimberly, Becky, your teams had the highest scores.
Yes.
JoshuaandJulie,Bertand
Viktor, Fallene and Bryce, your teams had the lowest scores.
We're going to talk to the team with the highest scores first and then we'll bring you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Itwasamess.
It really was a mess, I'm sorry to say this.
I feel like ours is--they're gonna say harsh things.
Well,here'sthefunnything.
If you look at it, costume, costume, costume.
Yeah.
Who'sontherunway?
Ready to wear, ready to wear, ready to wear.
Itjustfeelsveryhorrible, the wait, like somebody punched you in the stomach and threw you down on the stage.
Anthony,Laura,tellusabout your look.
Wedecidedon thecolorred.
You know, we wanted a wow.
Carla was gonna just, when she walked out, it was like, whoa.
Ilikedit alot .
I think it was dramatic enough.
I loved all those little pieces.
You know, you can always tell when designers do that, it means so much work.
I guess most people probably think it's just, like, thrown on there and glued together.
Ididnothand-sewanyof that.
It is all with a hot glue gun.
ScrapwhatIsaidbefore.
Well...
Ilovedthislook.
I love that color.
I love the detailing of the little black belt.
This looked so elegant, not costumey at all.
It looks amazing.
Ireallylikethis.
I thought it was very beautiful, the way it flowed and the way the wind made it move was beautiful.
My only worry--and Anthony, we've had this on two occasions with you--is it's a little referential to me.
It looks like something that
I've seen, so please try to be original when you design.
But other than that, it is absolutely beautiful.
Ithinkthetrickiestthing to do is, if you scaled it down and she wasn't on stilts, would it still be fabulous?
And I think it would still be fabulous.
Butwhotakesmore responsibility for this gorgeous look?
Well,I toldherbeforewe got here, I was like, if we get up there, I want you to take it.
That'snice.
All right, Danielle, Cecilia, tell us about your look.
Itreflectsverymuchwhat we do.
Uh, we wanted to create elegance.
So,whodidwhatexactly?
Whenwesawthe stiltwalkers,
I instantly thought of doing a huge sleeve, so I was really married to the blouse idea and then Cecilia came up with the pants.
Ilikethislook.
I like the blouse.
I like the color combination.
I like the brown pants and I like the way you constructed them.
I like the sheerness, that you can see through.
I think that's very nice.
What ruins it for me is her head.
Thehairis crazy!
I mean, my God!
Ilovethislook.
I think this is so chic, and I love bling, and I do love that detailing, and I think the thing that stood out to me the most was just that color, I think, is so rich.
Thankyou.
Thankyou,Kim.
It'sa veryprettyoutfit.
Ithoughtyoupickeda beautiful fabric, but it's about drama, and it's too quiet.
Listen,youpickedthe trickiest fabric in the world.
I mean, chiffon, and to do it impeccably is--it takes so much time.
Wewereverycomfortable using chiffon, which everybody thought it was a bit crazy, given the restraint on time.
Mm-hmm.
Anditwasactuallyacrazy idea.
Becauseyoucandoa chiffon pant like that and make someone just look like a mess, and she doesn't.
KimberlyandBecky,tellus about your look.
Weknewinstantlywhenwegot our model that we wanted to do something edgy.
We wanted to play on each other's strengths.
So she's strong in jackets.
I like structure, so I wanted to do a tailored pant.
Iwasveryimpressedwhen I saw this outfit.
You tailored the pants and it still is a showstopper because it is so sharp, because it is almost perfect.
Thankyou.
Ithinkyouguysarekick-ass tailors.
I mean, you really cut a mean pant.
Thankyou.
Thanks.
Thankyou.
It'llmakeeverywomanwho wants to wear it want to get that tattoo.
You need the tattoo.
Ilovethepants.
Oh,thankyou.
Lovethepants.
My only detail that I feel could have been edited is that half-collar.
It just looks a little circusy.
But all in all, it was one of my favorite looks too.
Thankyou.
Nowwe'regoingtotalk to the designers with the lower scores.
Thank you very much.
You can leave the runway.
Bert, Viktor, tell us about your look.
Ichosethebottompart 'cause I wanted it to be a little bit more modern and thin.
And Bert chose the top part.
We did--had our little struggles, and we did--had miscommunications and things like that.
Tome,it 'slikethe wallpaper and curtains at a really tacky catering hall.
Mm-hmm.
Ihatethatdustruffleof gold on the top of it.
It's just, it's really old.
It'salmostlikeinthemovie
The Sound of Music, when they took the drapes off and made their clothes, but like Marie
Antoinette days.
It really does look like curtains.
Ithinkit lookslikeabad costume.
It's terrible.
Idon'tbelievethatthis was what I wanted to present.
Soyouthinkit'shis responsibility.
Ididn'tcreatethis.
Okay.
Viktor, what do you think?
Iownit .
I think we both worked at it at the end and we finished it and--
Sowhenyousay ,"Iownit,"
it means that it was your idea.
Imean,Iown the workwith him because we both did very much 50-50.
"Iownit "?
50-50 is not "I own it."
No,like,no ,notown it.
I guess I'm being responsible for it.
Sothatmeansifthis outfit today is the worst look, you would be the one to go home?
Oh,no.
No, no.
Well,then,that'snot owning it.
Bert,you'returningslightly lobster color.
Oh,amI?
Sorry.
He was very emphatic about, "I want to do this, we need to do a
Victorian," and I found it unusual that he wouldn't sketch.
He said, "Well, you sketch it.
You sketch better."
Whywouldyounot sketch something?
No,I-I--no,Idid sketch.
No,youtoldme, "Bert,you sketch, you sketch."
It'sinmy HP computer.
Itseemslikeyou two had a lovely day yesterday.
Yes.
Allright,fromone strange look to the next, Fallene and
Bryce, tell us about your outfit.
Ihadtheidea,becausewe were working with such long legs, that we could do a really, really big, kind of full tulle skirt and then we were gonna have cute little details up on the top.
Butliterally,yougavehera
Black Swan.
Yeah.
Idon'tgetit.
Thishasno effortput into it.
It does look like just a tank top that I wear to bed and it looks like a tie wrapped around the waist a couple times.
This just looks like you could have done this in 15 minutes.
Youknow,Ithinktheidea had so much promise.
However, there's nothing.
There's no detail.
It's just the beginning of something.
It's--it's--likeyousaid, it's, like, half done.
Soit'slikenonedone ,then .
Yeah.
Iloveherheadpiece.
I think the headpiece is nice.
Well,I 'msogladImade something.
Ithinktheheadpieceis great.
Listen, to me, it's like she's got every dance reference and it ends up just looking like nothing because they don't meld.
SoBryce,if thiswas the worst look, who do you think should go home?
Um,I thinkbothofus.
I think that--I think this was a team effort.
Unfortunately,itwouldbe only one.
IthinkIshouldbeableto stay.
I did my best.
Iwouldsaymyself.
IwouldsayFallene.
Josh,Julie,tellusabout your look.
Well,I cameup withthe concepts.
Andtheconceptwas circus?
No,itwasmatador.
Ole,ole,ole!
I mean, guys, you know, drama doesn't mean tacky.
Spanishmatador,youcan be inspired by that, you know, and that could be really chic.
You know, we've seen it.
Ijustthinkit'syetanother
Halloween costume.
It's the weirdest hybrid I've ever heard of.
Andshe'sgotthesetiny arms and these extremely long legs.
It gives her a very bizarre-- when she walked out, I was like, huh.
Forget the matador, circus, and all that.
Theonlypositivethingthat
I could say about this outfit is, it looks well made.
Iagree.
Imean,it is sharp.
That it is, definitely.
So if we decide that this is the worst look for today, who should go home?
Well,itwasmyidea ,andI 'm not gonna throw Josh under the bus.
Whatdoyouthink,Josh ?
Iwouldhopenot togohome, and I would not choose myself.
Soyou'resayingyou would choose Julie.
Yes,I wouldchooseJulie.
Okay,sowe 'veheardwhat you had to say.
We're gonna have a little chat and then I'll call you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Thankyou.
Let'stalkaboutthe designs and the designers that we did like today.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Thegarmentreallylooked modern, dramatic, exciting.
Well,itwasthe rightchoice of color, it was the right way to do the pants, and it still looks like a gown.
Ithoughtit wasbeautifulon the model wearing stilts, and I could picture it on a woman without the stilts.
Thatwaspretty.
Then we have Danielle and
Cecilia.
Ihappenedto likethat outfit.
I think it's just really chic.
Andthebeadingwas beautiful.
Theplushereistotakethat chiffon and make something that is finished beautifully.
The chiffon, if you make a mistake, she's in a rag.
DanielleandCecilia,they both know how to sew.
Oh,yeah.
Theydo.
Yousawit here.
BeckyandKimberly.
Thesimpletruthis, they sent out something impeccably tailored.
The pants were fantastic.
Andtheproportionswere right.
Yes.
Italsodidn'tlooklike two designers did something and they stuck it together.
Butrealistically,theyhad a very cohesive look.
Yeah,I thoughtthatit looked like it was done by one person.
Metoo.
Let'stalkaboutthe designers that we didn't like.
Even though it was Julie's idea to make this circus matador outfit, I can still see Josh's bedazzling in there.
They'reanoddteam,when you think about Julie and Josh.
Julie is, you know, rocky, you know, mountain woman, and Josh is like, bedazzle it, glamorous, and kind of those two things together ended up with this insane, very tacky matador outfit.
Yeah.
Youareadesigner.
You're selling design, you're selling taste.
Imean,therewas likeso many details, you didn't know where to look.
It was crazy.
Bryce and Fallene.
Yougetto theBlackSwan /Bob
Fosse combo.
I mean, the hat was the only thing that had any bit of charm or, I don't know, personality.
Itlookedliketwo different eras.
It was like showgirl hat, ballerina--I--you know, it didn't go together at all.
Yeah.
Dance hall girl, modern dance, and ballet, all combined.
What if they hadn't had-- aninspiration.
There was nothing.
It was a promise of an idea, but they couldn't deliver anything.
I mean, I'm not defending Bryce, but I think at least he's got a little more spunk.
Buttheonlythingthat we did like was the hat, and she made the hat.
Ifthehatwasn'tthere,you really would have fallen asleep.
ViktortotallythrewBert under the bus.
He didn't really say it, but he did.
Well,BertthrewViktorunder the bus too.
IjustthinkthatViktoris full of it, and he just--
Idotoo.
Youknow,IbelieveBert when he says he didn't do a drawing and all of that stuff.
Shouldn'tBerthavesaid,
"You know what?
I think this thing is not working."
It's ugly drapes.
I mean, they're ugly drapes.
Awfulfabric.
Everythingbadin thehouse on your body.
Sowe'vemadeour decision?
Okay, let's bring them back out.
Your teams represent the highest and the lowest scores.
One designer will be the winner of this challenge and one designer will be out.
AnthonyRyanandLaura,you two did a great job.
Laura, congratulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
That means that you have immunity next time.
Anthony Ryan, we think that you also did a great job.
Laura and Anthony Ryan, you can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
Winningisawesome,but it's also wonderful winning with such a great partner that was so gracious.
Oh!
I knewit .
So who won?
Idid.
Oh!

Thankyou.
Josh,Julie,you'rein.
You can leave the runway.

Your fabric choice was so very wrong that almost anything that you would have done with it would have been bad.
Bert, you're in.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
BryceandFallene,yourlook was boring ballerina.
It looked like there was no effort put into it.
Bryce, you're in.

Iwasn'treadyfor Joshto go.
He has so much talent, and there's people like Fallene that don't even know really what their direction is at this point.
She talks to much about being a hairstylist, I'm not even sure if she's a designer, you know?
Mm-hmm.
[Yawning]Oh,man.
I'm just freakin' nervous for today.
I'm like, maybe I'm too much of a normal person.
I never thought I would be normal, but...

There'sa bigbull's-eyeon the two of us.
Forthefirsttimeever on

[All gasp]
Whoa.
I got goosebumps.
Just the bigness of it is very, very exciting to me.
Soyourjobistomakesure that your look will stand out...
But be in at the same time.
Good luck, everybody.
And we all will see you on the outdoor runway.

You know, obviously, sometimes-- no,yeah,keepgoing.
Youknow?
Talktome ,becauseifyou talk and I can draw-- butsometimes,we canhave them like they're coming out of something, you know?
Right.
Iwasthinkingmorelike old
Hollywood.
Something more classic, so...
MaeWest?
Yeah,like,evenMae West.
Exactly.
Like it's a--it's-- you can make it have pants.
MaeWestneverworepants.
Her entire life.
No, she didn't.
She wore skirts.
Bertistoodefensive.
He needs to calm down.
[Indistinct chatter]
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Howexcitedareyou about this challenge?
It's completely thrilling.
I want you to think about a couple of things.
Think about Paris Couture Week.
It causes you to question what's real and what isn't.
Very much like this challenge.
I'm always looking at fashion illustrations, which I happen to love, but I always say, "These aren't real women."
Well, for this challenge, they are.
Everyonealwayssaysthat when I draw my fashion figures, they're so, like, long.
It's kind of like our fashion illustrations get to come to life.
It's a pretty exciting challenge, I think, for all the designers.
Iambringinginyour stilt walker models.
You will have 30 minutes to consult with them as a team.
We're going shopping at Mood, and each team will have a budget of $500.
Whoo!
Andyouhaveone day for this challenge.
So it's today.
Noway.
Way.
Areyoucrazy?
SoI 'msendingin your models.
Have fun!
Doesithavetobepants ?
Iwouldimagine.
Probably.
Sothatyoucan-- thedresswouldget tangled.
Yeah,yeah.
That'd be a disaster.
Oh,great,Ihavenevereven talked to her.
She's never really talked to me.
But we agreed on kind of a look and a style, and realized, "Oh, she makes great pants."
And I make great tailored jackets, so...
That's what we're doing.
Yes.
Hey,ladies.
Over here.
Hi,howareyou ?
[Overlapping chatter]
Sithere.
Okay.
Icancrouchall the way down to, like...
Like that, or-- whataboutsleeves?
Does that bother you?
Howisit ,walkingin something...
Long and full?
Itisimportantthatit's not below where my feet fasten into my stilts.
Whereyourstiltis.
Becauseitcausesyou to tumble.
Ourinspirationforthis design, we're thinking Parisian couture.
Just a really flattering silhouette, and not make her look like she's in the circus, walking down a runway.
Theway--I'mthinkingdrapey.
Okay,realdrapey.
Okay.
I'mthinkinglikethis.
Butthinkcircus-ytoo .
Oh,I--Iam .
Like, think about it moving back behind her.
Like, it's gonna be like flowing and moving.
So Fallene and I know that we want to do a big, full skirt.
And we're inspired by our model.
She has been a ballerina forever.
She's got tattoos, funky hair.
We definitely want to go with this kind of dark ballerina.
KindoflikeQueenVictoriaa little bit, like, just...
Oh,that'sverygood.
Alittlebitbig here.
Nice, big, like, open here.
But maybe a big collar.
But it's sexy here.
Uh-huh.
QueenVictoriawasin mourning for 50 years.
I don't think that's a sexy direction I would like to go into.
Ifyoudo adressthat 'slike a bust like here, her boobs are gonna be showing like this.
That'snotVictorian.
That's Elizabethan.
Well,whatever.
Well,there'sadifference.
Bertisaknow-it-all.
He's just very obnoxious.
Viktorreallyneedstodoa little bit of book reading.
Designers...
Say good-bye to your models.
They will be back later today for a fitting.
[Indistinct chatter]
Bye!
Thankyou,ladies.
All right, let's head out to our first trip to Mood.
So follow me.
Design teams, here we go.
Your 30 minutes begins...
Right now.
Alittlebithere,here , here, and more here, and then boom.
Viktor.
Bert,darling.
Whereareyou?
Whereareyou?
Backhere.
Look.
Follow my voice.
Iwantto to ,like,akimono with this, and then have big sleeves, and not go-- sobigsleevesmeancouture?
I literally had to bite my tongue.
How much training do you have in couture?
What'sthis?
Ourgameplanistojustpull every red shade that we like.
We have our grocery list.
So it's just a matter of executing it.
Yeah,I likethispattern better.
Butasfarasthat ,Ifeel like it should be more modern.
Areyoutwoall right?
Yes,we'regreat.
Okay.
You're kind of a dream team.
So...
We'rehavingagoodtime .
Wehavehighexpectations.
Iwaslookingforwardtoa team challenge, and to have one with Oliver, it is a dream.
Canthisbe pleated?
Ugh.
Julie,anythingin lifecan be pleated.
She was rockin' my nerves.
Ooh,I likethetextureof this.
Chiffon is the lightest of all the fabrics you can grab.
It's like this...
[Exhales]
Of silk.
So I think it'd be cool to do something that's almost a muted, like, really muted polka dot.
This is way too [bleep]-- insteadofthedenim?
Yeah.
Okay,gofindit.
I'mnotsettlingfor all black.
We're not creating a freakin' gothic...stilt walker.
Youhavetwominutes remaining.
Oh!
Okay.
Soweneedtohurryup.
Yes,weneedtohurryup.
Thankyou.
Thereisnothinglikeit,so
I'm just grabbing anything.
Geta lotof it .
Allright,designers.
Time is up.
Design teams at the register.
Anya, you're walking the wrong way.
So let's head back to Parsons.
Thank you, Mood!
All:
Thankyou!
Hey.
Yeah,let'snotfocussomuch on this.
Well,that'spartofthe dress.
I'mnotsayingwe're building a-- no,I 'mnotdisagreeingwith anything you're saying, though.
Ijustwanttomake sure we know what we're going as far as units.
We've agreed on the silhouette.
It's going to be a strapless bustier piece, and then there'll be this full skirt.
MayI haveyourattention, just for a moment?
You have until 9:00 tonight.
All right, work hard.
I will see you later.
Thank you.
Doyoufeelcomfortable making very well-fitting pants?
I'mcomfortablewithpattern making, so...
Okay,foryour...
Otherlooks, were you happy with the fit?
Lady,I makecustom-made clothing for people with all kind of bodies.
I know how to fit pants.
YouknowthatIwantedthe other prints, right?
Like a more modern print.
They might say it might be dated, 'cause it's a little bit too flowery.
It's gonna be definitely a challenge to work with that ugly fabric.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
Ithinkthisfabricis genius.
Assoonas he foundthe fabric, I knew the idea.
Josh and myself are doing a romantic matador stilt walker.
Imean,youcoloredit,not me.
Butifyoudon 'tput it underneath the whole dress and the jacket, then you're gonna-- it's gonna be messy.
Whatdoyoumean,messy?
Ithoughttheshapewas supposed to be kind of roundish.
Ifeelthisdirectionwe're taking is absolutely wrong.
It's not what we need to be presenting in 2011.
Whydon'tyoufinishthis , since you have the whole idea?
No,I don'thavethe whole idea.
This is a design that we're working on together.
No,I know.
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying--no, no, no.
You need to hold on.
You need to hold on.
Letmefinish.
I'llbeback.
Okay,youcomeback.
Ican'tdealwithyou.
It's like you act like a small kid, like, you--you don't let me talk.
No,' causeyou'regetting confused.
No,it'snotaquestion.
It's not a question.
It was a comment.
Okay,well,I'mmakinga statement.
Saveitforthe judge.
He's, like, so immature.
He's like a 57-year-old kid.
It's only his way or the highway.
It's kind of difficult to make sense with somebody who's crazy.
[Whistling]
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
We'reallfeelingtense.
Anyone could go down because of their teammate.
That'sveryimmature.
What'simmatureis you'renot letting me finish.
[Clearsthroat]
What was that about?
What?
What are you talking about?
[Both laugh]
I just think he kind of just gets defensive right away.
And it's unnecessary.
He'sshakingin hisboots.
He doesn't have immunity this time.
Here'stheskirt.
And I was just saying, like, since you have the idea how you're doing this-- that'sfine,butyou switched fabrics on us a couple times.
It'smostlyyourdesign.
I'm just kind of following you.
No,itisn't.
Butwecouldgoonandon and talk about-- no,I 'mjustgettingthat-- clarifying what I understood we said in the store.
Okay,so,youwanttotalk- - thatwasmy understanding.
Well, no, but it...
Bertwillfightyou on anything, even if there is nothing to fight about.
Idon'twanttodebatethat.
I just wanna do this.
MaybeI do.
That'sveryimmature.
No,it'snot.
What's immature is you're not letting me finish.
Okay,it's--letme hearyou .
That'sallI'msaying.
Youknow,Idon 'tknowwhat
Bert has in his mind.
I almost feel like he does things on purpose to sabotage me, or maybe it's a strategy.
I don't--I have no idea.
Working,working,working, working.
Thehardestpartofdesigning a garment for a stilt walker is figuring out how to make her look as chic as possible, and also to make it safe.
Yeah,butthisiswhat I'm envisioning.
Fullness, we want at the bottom.
So we need a hoop, right?
Right.
Laura and I agree on making a cage for a big hoop skirt.
Almost like an old Alabama plantation girl.
Thiswillbe an old petticoat?
Yes.
Just allow for some volume on the bottom to get that dramatic effect, but so it didn't get caught under the model's stilts.
So I'm cutting all this boning and gluing and circles.
And...
A lot of math.
[Singsong]Teamwork.
Whatdoyouthink the color should be?
Well,justsomethinghigh around the neck.
Either wrapping or, like-- we want dramatic.
Ithink,whenitcomesto group challenge, it's not about how brilliant or how amazing you can do by yourself.
It's much more about the collaboration and communication between the two people.
No,I wannado ,like,a little bullfighter jacket.
But--but the sleeves so you can hold it and be, like...
Right.
Doesthatmakesense?
And then, if you made a bustier-- but,like,doesthatmake sense?
Doesthatmakesense?
Doyouneedtopoke me?
Quit poking me.
You're like a poker and a puncher.
You're such a rough chick.
I'mthemanhere.
MeandJuliecouldbasically flop genders.
[Laughter]
Soonceyoumakethis pattern, you think you can base all the other ones off of this, right?
Yeah.
Okay,good.
A lot of teams thought that we were crazy for working with chiffon.
And, yeah, it's a little bit of a risk.
Okay.
Mostdesignersconsider chiffon difficult.
Danielle and I are very comfortable with those fabrics.
And we love how it flows and how it moves.
The thing about Becky's personality is I really can't read it.
She stares a lot.
She just stares.
So you just wonder what's going through her mind.
What?
What?
I think we're all feeling tense because anyone could go down because of their teammate.
So it's not just about one person anymore.
So it's anybody's game today.
[Sighs]
Youmakingagianttutu ?
[Chuckles]Yeah.
Awesome.
Beckysoundedscaredwhenshe said that.
"You're making a black tutu?"
You were in the bottom last time, right?
It'sprettyimportantfor me and Bryce to do well.
We were both in the bottom, and we both got paired up together.
Weneedto havesomething that is a thin line between costume and fashion.
Bryce,I justwanttolook at this real quick with you.
This bodice with that is, like, pretty blah.
And I really feel like that turquoise as a waistband would-- no.
Why?
Absolutelynot.
Whynot?
Dude,it'stoomuch.
Youreallydon'tthinkthat looks good?
No,I donot.
This is way too much pop.
No, I am not doing the turquoise.
Okay.
Bryceistakingoverallthe control, so I'm feeling like I can't have any input because he'll probably bite my head off.
Justgetthebodicedone first, and then we'll worry about this stuff later.
Okay.
Ithinkhe trustsmewith the style that I'm doing.
Yeah.
Yeah,yeah.
WorkingwithJoshisactually surprisingly really smooth.
Wasthisateamchallenge?
[Laughs]
'CauseI 'mworkingalone.
[Laughter]
No,whereis she?
It'sfine.
It's quiet over here.
Ooh,dramaon 34thstreet.
[Laughter]
Soa couplehoursintothis challenge, Anthony's been trying to make this cage that we had a great idea for.
Thisisliterallygonnatake hours.
I mean, what do you think about that?
'Causeifyouthinkthis isn't working, we can't spend any time on it.
Thisisn'tgonnawork.
Okay.
Problemsolved.
Weneedto scratchitand move forward.
Soitmightjustlook awesome, because then we have to put the pants everywhere.
Allthelayers,yeah.
Kimberly,whatdo youthink?
I have a collar on here.
Uh...
Ithinkit 'snottoo
Star Trek-y, it's, uh--
Ithinkwe definitelyneed something here.
You know, everybody's going big and elaborate;
We gotta-- getsomesparkle.
Wegottagetsomething.
KimberlyandIare getting along fine.
But I wasn't gonna let her put gold lame on that thing.
Sorry.
Gross.
[Sighs]
Ijustwanttomake sure that...
I'm, like, cutting it on the right grain.
I feel like I am, though.
Well,youshouldbematching it, sweetheart.
Any piece of fabric, you have threads that are going this way and threads that are going this way.
So you should have your grain on your drape.
Right,yeah.
It'sreallyimportanttoline up your fabric on grain, meaning grain line that matches up with this thread.
If it doesn't, then it can skew the whole thing.
Yeah,youneedtobecareful.
'Cause it's--if it gets off grain, you're screwed.
Okay.
Ijustgotout ofschool,so it's all fresh in my head.
Did you ever go to school?
No.
Youneverwenttoschool?
Hm-mmm.
Oh.
Fallene has no training.
She is self-taught.
And I'm worried about that.
IfeellikeIhave toconfirm everything with you right now, because I'm totally lost.
No,ifit makesyou feel good, I don't mind being comforting.
Ijustcouldnot see the grain line on that fabric.
[Sighs] Oh, God.
I'm glad we have a good relationship, Bryce.
[Softly]Shedidn'tknowhow to cut it on-grain.
[Loudly]What?
Ongrain.
Sodidshe,like,take the fabric and was like, "wah!"
It'sjustadifferenceof being self-taught and going to school.
She'strying,but...
Right.
I'vebeenturningintothe boss.
Whichthenwillput alotof responsibility on your shoulders, though.
'Cause then, at the end, if it comes down to they still didn't like it, then they're like,
"Well, who led?"
It's hard.
Hello,designers!
All:
Hi,Tim.
JoshuaandJulie.
Hi,Tim.
Howareyouall ?
We'redefinitelyhelpingeach other out, and I think our styles will collide.
Collide...
Orconverge?
Both:
Converge.
Okay.
Ithinkwe 'll...
They'vecollidedalittle bit, but...
We'regonnago forthis little Spanish feel.
She'sa bullfighter?
Both:
Yes.
Ole!
Pshew!
Juliehasbeenworkingon that jacket forever.
Butit'scute.
Lookatthisbeautiful...
Wefoundthisgreatfabric.
And I think it's gonna create like a great--
Ithinkit 'ssmashing.
Smashing.
IloveJoshuaM's pants.
It reminds me of Beetlejuice.
Carryon.
Appreciateit.
CeceliaandDanielle,how are you doing?
Good.
We're doing sort of a tailored blouse with a teal chiffon with a big, huge, billowy sleeve.
Okay.
Andtheseareour fabrics.
We're using a lot of materials that we both like.
Sowhenshewalks,youknow, these sleeves will billow back.
And it's all about movement.
Yeah.
Well,it'sallaboutthe proportion of the bottom garment to the top garment.
And it just needs--needs to work.
Theproportionsareso different, we are unfamiliar with how this look will fit.
ViktorandBert.
Talk to me.
Iguesswe wantedtostart with a bodice and do something very tight.
And also, a little bit of structure, just to create the drama.
Drama'simportant.
But this isn't intended to be a costume.
No,no.
No .
GoodLord.
That thing is ghastly.
Ithinkhe wasthinkingof doing it this way, and I was thinking of doing it the other way.
Iwantedto do acontemporary look, and he was at, "Well, I really think we should do this."
And I had some other ideas, and, no, this is what we have to do.
No,that'snottrue.
Whenever I suggest, "that doesn't work;
Maybe we could do something like this," and automatically, he goes, "That's not gonna work.
This won't work."
So right now, I'm in the point where I'm just kind of trying to get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtrying-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
Comingupon
Project Runway...
Areyouworried?
It's nerve-racking, because this thing might fall apart.
No,no,likethis.
I mean, this is [bleep] up because I listened to you.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
I'mjustkindoftryingto get it done.
Well,gettingit doneis important.
Yeah,andI'mtryingto-- andyoucan'tdothat ifyou walk away and walk out of the room when someone doesn't agree with you.
CanI tellyouwhatconcerns me about our conversation?
I don't think I've heard either of you say "We."
This has to be a "We."
Yeah.
Itneedsto be .
Yeah.
Well,earlier,he said,
"This is your design," and I said, "No, it's not."
No,I didn'tsaythat.
Youdid.
Whateveryou'regoingtodo, you need to do it now.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Wow, color.
Red.
Red.
When you said "Paris," that's the big key word, that did it for me, having that dramatic feel to it.
Theseshoulderpadsare very on trend for fall.
We'remakingtheskirtoutof this.
Then we're lining it with the charmeuse that we made these out of, so I'm-- andyoufeelyou can control this well enough?
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, if you can pull this off, I think it's a wow moment.
That'swhatwe wantto hear, right?
Yeah.
Becky and Kimberly.
Beckykindof thoughtof military, and I kind of was like punk, which the model was totally for and about.
Andshehasatattooonher collarbone.
Mm-hmm.
Andsowe wentwitha one-shoulder so we could see this great tattoo over here.
Oh.
Ijustmadethe greensleeve and now I'm gonna make one in the stripe to see which one we like better.
I'mhopingthatthisworksin the stripe.
Yeah.
You'veworkedwelltogether?
Yeah.
She makes good pants, I make good jackets.
We divide and conquer.
Great.
Thankyou.
Thanks,Tim.
IfeellikeIhave ablack cloud over me.
Fallene,youneedtoownthis look.
How are you feeling?
I--I'mgood.
I'm-- youare?
I'mjustworriedit'sgetting too big.
Heidi said, "Go big."
I was gonna keep going.
This is my gut telling me to stop.
Youlistento yourgut , both of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatisthistextilebeing used for?
Um,sothisisgonnabethe bodice.
I liked the polka dot because I felt that it gave some color and some pop, which is me.
Rightnow,Ireallywant
Fallene to get this bodice done so that we can worry about the pants.
Okay,go.
Go ,go ,go .
Thankyou.
AnyaandOlivier.
I'd love to hear what you're doing.
Well,theideawas ,uh, because Olivier's really menswear and I do womens wear, we have this polar opposite way of working and way of seeing things.
Ithinkthismakesyoua great team.
Yeah,andso it 'sgonnahave this tight feeling of, like, things holding her.
Uh-huh.
Andthisgoingontopof this.
I'llbeblunt.
I think it's unexpected.
Timseemsalittlethrownoff by our fabric selections.
Maybe he just doesn't know how to say, "I don't like it."
[Laughs]
Bye,everybody.
All:
Bye, Tim.
Havea goodnight.
Thanks.
Youtoo.
Bertzilla.
Bertzilla,yousaid?
Yeah.
Isthatmy newname?
I'mgonnacutthissoit won't be boggy.
Yeah,yeah,cool.
Unlessyouwantthat.
No,it'scool.
Beautiful.
Timdidmentionall heheard was "I, I, I," which is true, but I am willing to just start again, like, leave that behind and enjoy the moment.
Becauseofthat,thisis taking forever.
I'm sorry.
Justgetit done.
Iwill.
IthinkBryceand Falleneare in trouble because even though they have this great, voluminous tutu that's really impressive looking, there's nothing else that they have.
And I know Fallene's having trouble getting the bodice done.
Isitalmostdone?
It'sdone,butwhatelse do we need to sew?
ThecincherthatIwasgonna have you do, it's basically here's the two pieces together.
I'm showing Julie a quick and effective way to get a ruching effect for the waistband.
Leave these two ends open and stitch this one side down.
And then you're gonna have to grab this.
Oh,yeah,yeah.
Bringitallthe way overto here, and then it's all gonna shrink into itself and it's just gonna make, like, a great cover belt.
Perfect.
I'minsuchbad shapewith this.
We don't have time.
No,golikethis,golike this.
Here.
Go just like-- no,no.
Likethis.
Imadethisis[ bleep]edup because I listened to you.
No, I really don't care about [bleep] anymore.
I'll make interfacing.
I'm sorry.
Itiswhatitis,Danielle.
Attheendofthenight ,I'm already concerned because it's a one-day challenge and chiffon takes double the time.
Hello.
[Overlapping chatter]
Thisisso weird.
Howdoyouput pantson?
Pantsfirst,thenstilts.
I'venever,like-- neverhemmedagiantbefore.
Ithinkit 'sbeautiful.
It's like Alice in Wonderland.
Thisisafantasy.
It's not a costume, okay?
That's the word.
It's fantasy.
Howlongdo we have?
Ten minutes?
Whyareyouworried?
Well,I wantto seeitcome together.
Nowitlookslikeamess.
Yeah.
Oh,myGod.
It's gonna come out okay.
Doyouhaveabodicetofit on her?
Yeah.
Oh,good.
Holdthatand,like...
Is it?
I'll re-cut it.
I know, it's--it's looking weird.
It'soff-grain.
It'slookingweird.
[Bleep].
Okay.
Once I put the bodice onto her,
I thinking, oh, why is this all wonky?
And didn't even realize that I didn't cut it on-grain.
I just feel like I can't do simple things right now 'cause
I'm, like, so tired and on edge.
WhenFallenecutsthe bodice off-grain, it's a big deal, and you have to immediately re-cut.
I'm worried that she won't have enough time to do something like that.
I just--I don't know how this is gonna go.
Seeyoutomorrow.
Ciao.
Bye.
Itlooksokay.
Actually, this looks nice.
[Both laugh]
I'm sorry, I don't mean to snap at you, it's just there is no time for getting fancy at this point.
Oh,Bryce.
What happened to me today?
This is really bad.
Ihaveafeelingwe'regonna be in the bottom two or the bottom three.
Itjust--it'sjustreally disappointing.
I let Bryce down 'cause I just could not finish my garment, so it's...
I'm sorry.
It'sokay.
It'sreallygonnalookbad for you.
I'm so sorry.
[Sniffles]
Allright,guys,let 'smove.
[Alarm beeps]
Areyouexcitedfor today?
I'mwonderingwherewe're going.
That's the exciting part.
[Laughter]
Ithinkouroutfitlooks good.
Ithinkit looksvery,very good.
It's--it'sdefinitelywhat you and I put together.
IthinknowI'm okaywith it.
Yesterday, I was a little bit hoping for a thunderstorm.
Everyonewasintense yesterday.
Some people here, they can whip [bleep] up so fast, you know?
Like, I feel like I'm not at that level to do that.
Dothebestyou can .
Just do the best you can.
IwishIhad mysoul right now.
I feel like I'm kind of-- well,maybeyou'llfinditin the workroom today.
Maybe it's sitting under a table just waiting for you.
All right.
Later.
Let'sgo.
[Overlapping chatter]
Well,sincewe finishedon time, we can chill.
Maybegluesomeofthefabric from here?
Sure.
I'mgonnafigureout whether or not we can do, like, a tube top or something like that.
Westillhavealotofthis left.
I'mnervousaboutwhatpeople are gonna think.
The bodice is cut off-grain, so it's a mess.
We could send it down but I feel like it's too bad.
Brycedecideslastminuteto just put together a tube top, and I just let him take over at that point.
Falleneissweet.
Bryce really pushed her around a bit.
He's very sort of a bossy kid.
Oh,youchangedthe top ?
Itwasnotcut on-grain.
Oh,right.
Like,itlookedlikeitwas melting or something awful.
Ithinkthatlooks--that'll look nice.
Yeah.
Okay, we're done talking about it.
It needs to be sewn, because this jacket has taken you over
12 hours and-- itlooksgreat.
Oh,Julie.
Oh!
Oh,Julie.[Growls]
Didyou--didyou--didyou manage to stitch some of the shoulder last night?
No,itwassotighttothe mannequin.
I didn't have time to sew everything perfectly.
It's nerve-racking because I'm worried that this thing might fall apart.
Goodmorning,designers.
Goodmorning.
Thisisgoingtobeahugely jam-packed morning.
In an hour and a half, we are leaving the workroom for our outdoor runway.
Ithasn'tbeendoneonthe show before, and to be a part of the first public runway makes me completely speechless.
IfeellikeI'm running around with my head cut off, 'cause I don't think that I'm gonna have enough time to sew up a new top.
Comingupon project runway...
Thehairlookslikea pumpkin.
Iknowwe bothdon 'tthink this is our best work.
We'reheadedto ourfirst outdoor runway ever.
I'msortof freakingout .
No,you'regonnabefine .
Idon'tthinkthere'sany making this attractive.
[Sighs]
Son of a bitch.
Bryceiscompletelystressed out, and I felt bad but after seeing what he's producing, I'm sort of freaking out.
Idon'tknow.
Maybe I should put the zip in.
Idon'tfeelthat'sright.
I don't know.
I'mjust--I'mhonestlyso frustrated right now.
I mean, I know we both don't think this is our best work.
Like,ifwe justadd ,like,a couple little-- foryourjacket.
It'smajor.
IfJoshwantstobedazzle,
I'm gonna let him do it.
[Laughs]
Wehavealot moretodo-- all the finishing work on the skirt and then attach it to the bodice.
I'm just hoping we have enough time.
IknewIwantedtocreatea headpiece, knowing that this is a team effort and I didn't create anything.
And so I got the red feathers.
I broke 'em up with some of the fabric to kind of bring something interesting to this garment.
It'sbeautiful.
It's really stunning.
ThisistheJoshside .
Andyouseweditbeautifully.
It's sewn beautifully.
With Julie, I knew it could go one of two ways--completely horrible or amazing between both of us, and I think that we're gonna do something that might shock a lot of people.
Designers,I amsendingin your models.
You will have an hour to send your models to the L'Oreal Paris makeup room and the Garnier hair studio.
The Piperlime wall, of course, is important here.
I'm being very strict about the schedule this morning because we have a curtain call, everyone.
Right.
Allright?
Thank you.
[Overlapping chatter]
Makeitjustatadbit tighter.
Josh,youwanttodomakeup?
I think you're gonna be better at that than I will.
I'llwageryouthat.
[Laughs]

I'msotired.
Oh,no.
That'snotwhattheywant .
Thanksforthat.
Thehairlookslikeahuge pumpkin on her head.
There was nothing we could do at this point because we had to walk out of there.
Designersandmodels,let 's go.
We're headed to our first outdoor runway ever and we're gonna have a blast.
I'mnotexcitedfor the runway show.
No, I'm terrified.
I'm thinking, like, that I could have made this work but instead
I just let him take over and we're in trouble.
Herewego .
[Overlapping chatter]
Where'smybigleopardbag?
Thankyou,Tim.
Ooh!
Wehavethishugeevent, bigger than actually I think any of us really thought it was going to be, and it's all taking place in battery park.
It still does not feel real.
Ihaveto saythatifIhad to have my show out in the middle of New York Harbor, I'd be a little nervous.
I'mjustoverjoyedbythis , being outdoors as well as all the press and it being the first time this has ever happened, everything is just exhilarating.
Andrightdownhere.
Behindthestageatthe runway show, it's just madness.
Backstage,I 'mpanicked.
After seeing all the fans and press and seeing my garment, I just fell apart.
I'mdisappointedthatI didn't make anything.
Butlisten,it 'sa collaboration between the two of you and you're responsible for the entire look.
We do the best we can under the conditions.
We do the best we can, all right?
IfeellikeI'm not evena designer right now.
I'm just, like, really disappointed.
Don'tbe.
No, you're gonna be fine.
Comingupon Project
Runway...
It'ssounbelievablytacky.
Itlookslikeabadcostume.
Andthenthehairiscrazy !
Westillhavetoknow , though, who is responsible for this mess.
Hi,everybody.
[Cheering]
It's been my dream to do this show once outside in front of all of our fans.
Thank you very much for coming, everybody.
[Cheering]
This is our first Project Runway live show outside, and we're very excited.
These are all of our new designers.
Welcome.
[Cheering]
Our judges--fashion designer
Michael Kors.
[Cheering]
And of course the lovely Nina
Garcia.
[Cheering]
And our guest judge today, Kim
Kardashian.
Welcome.
[Cheering]
Okay, everybody, enjoy the show.
[Cheering]
Ifeelreallyproudtobe seeing my garment on my model.
It's just a surreal moment for me, and I hope that it's the first of many to come.
Shelookslikeabedazzled
Spanish matador.
I mean, yeah, it was a little showy, but I thought it was appropriate for the event.
[Cheering]
It'sbiganddramatic,but the stilt models really freak me out.
They look like aliens or something.
Ihaveafeelingofregret that I was encumbered with
Viktor.
If I'd been by myself, my design would have been amazing in this setting, and I believe it would have been a knockout.
[Cheers and applause]
I'mexcitedbutalsoworried, because I wasn't so confident in what we had done.
Had we finished that bodice, we would have had a really cute look.
Now I'm just kind of worried about it.
I'mthinking,it 'samateur hour.
We both feel that we are gonna be on the chopping block.
I'm, like, super emotional right now.
[Cheering]
Mymodelwasalittleawkward in her walking.
It's just really strange, but she was wearing borrowed stilts.
Maybe that had something to do with it.
I'mverypleasedwithour look and I think it will go over really well.
The only think I would change is the pointed collar that Becky put on the shoulder pad.
I told her that it was too Star
Trek looking, but I think we fulfilled the challenge.
[Cheering]
Ithinkit 'saverycool garment, but if we could have speeded things up, we probably could have done a better job.
I'mpleasedthatitlooks beautiful but I really feel that this could have been super dynamic.
Regardless of how simple the dress is, it's still a pretty sight.
[Cheering]
I'mthinking,like,thisis beautiful.
The pants and the top fit perfectly, and they're flowing beautifully.
But then, when you get up to the hair, we were like, uh-oh.
Shelooksgreat.
You couldn't see any resemblance of a stilt in there, and I was afraid of that.
But I know that they are gonna hit me hard with the hairstyling.
It's just traumatic.
[Cheering]
IreallythinkthatAnthony and I have a really good chance in having the winning design.
It's chic, it's Parisian couture, just like Tim said, but yet it's got drama involved.
The charmeuse skirt is flying, the pants look beautiful and full.
It's just perfect.
I'msuperproudofjust what
Laura and I have accomplished.
Ours is definitely the wow dress.
I'm amazed at how the fabric just went.
It's just phenomenal.
[Cheers and applause]
[Applause]
Didyouenjoyshowingoff your work to a live audience today?
Verymuch.
Weexpectedto see show-stopping garments today, and we were very impressed by some of your designs, but others didn't do as well as we expected.
The winner of this challenge will receive immunity and cannot be eliminated for next week.
Olivier, you won the last challenge, so today you cannot be eliminated.
We scored your designs as they came down the runway.
One of you will be named the winner and one of you will be out.
Olivier, Anya, your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge.
You can leave the runway.
Thankyou.
Anthony, Laura, Danielle,
Cecilia, Kimberly, Becky, your teams had the highest scores.
Yes.
JoshuaandJulie,Bertand
Viktor, Fallene and Bryce, your teams had the lowest scores.
We're going to talk to the team with the highest scores first and then we'll bring you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Itwasamess.
It really was a mess, I'm sorry to say this.
I feel like ours is--they're gonna say harsh things.
Well,here'sthefunnything.
If you look at it, costume, costume, costume.
Yeah.
Who'sontherunway?
Ready to wear, ready to wear, ready to wear.
Itjustfeelsveryhorrible, the wait, like somebody punched you in the stomach and threw you down on the stage.
Anthony,Laura,tellusabout your look.
Wedecidedon thecolorred.
You know, we wanted a wow.
Carla was gonna just, when she walked out, it was like, whoa.
Ilikedit alot .
I think it was dramatic enough.
I loved all those little pieces.
You know, you can always tell when designers do that, it means so much work.
I guess most people probably think it's just, like, thrown on there and glued together.
Ididnothand-sewanyof that.
It is all with a hot glue gun.
ScrapwhatIsaidbefore.
[Laughter]
Well...
Ilovedthislook.
I love that color.
I love the detailing of the little black belt.
This looked so elegant, not costumey at all.
It looks amazing.
Ireallylikethis.
I thought it was very beautiful, the way it flowed and the way the wind made it move was beautiful.
My only worry--and Anthony, we've had this on two occasions with you--is it's a little referential to me.
It looks like something that
I've seen, so please try to be original when you design.
But other than that, it is absolutely beautiful.
Ithinkthetrickiestthing to do is, if you scaled it down and she wasn't on stilts, would it still be fabulous?
And I think it would still be fabulous.
Butwhotakesmore responsibility for this gorgeous look?
Well,I toldherbeforewe got here, I was like, if we get up there, I want you to take it.
That'snice.
All right, Danielle, Cecilia, tell us about your look.
Itreflectsverymuchwhat we do.
Uh, we wanted to create elegance.
So,whodidwhatexactly?
Whenwesawthe stiltwalkers,
I instantly thought of doing a huge sleeve, so I was really married to the blouse idea and then Cecilia came up with the pants.
Ilikethislook.
I like the blouse.
I like the color combination.
I like the brown pants and I like the way you constructed them.
I like the sheerness, that you can see through.
I think that's very nice.
What ruins it for me is her head.
Thehairis crazy!
I mean, my God!
Ilovethislook.
I think this is so chic, and I love bling, and I do love that detailing, and I think the thing that stood out to me the most was just that color, I think, is so rich.
Thankyou.
Thankyou,Kim.
It'sa veryprettyoutfit.
Ithoughtyoupickeda beautiful fabric, but it's about drama, and it's too quiet.
Listen,youpickedthe trickiest fabric in the world.
I mean, chiffon, and to do it impeccably is--it takes so much time.
Wewereverycomfortable using chiffon, which everybody thought it was a bit crazy, given the restraint on time.
Mm-hmm.
Anditwasactuallyacrazy idea.
Becauseyoucandoa chiffon pant like that and make someone just look like a mess, and she doesn't.
KimberlyandBecky,tellus about your look.
Weknewinstantlywhenwegot our model that we wanted to do something edgy.
We wanted to play on each other's strengths.
So she's strong in jackets.
I like structure, so I wanted to do a tailored pant.
Iwasveryimpressedwhen I saw this outfit.
You tailored the pants and it still is a showstopper because it is so sharp, because it is almost perfect.
Thankyou.
Ithinkyouguysarekick-ass tailors.
I mean, you really cut a mean pant.
Thankyou.
Thanks.
Thankyou.
It'llmakeeverywomanwho wants to wear it want to get that tattoo.
[Laughter]
You need the tattoo.
Ilovethepants.
Oh,thankyou.
Lovethepants.
My only detail that I feel could have been edited is that half-collar.
It just looks a little circusy.
But all in all, it was one of my favorite looks too.
Thankyou.
Nowwe'regoingtotalk to the designers with the lower scores.
Thank you very much.
You can leave the runway.
Bert, Viktor, tell us about your look.
Ichosethebottompart 'cause I wanted it to be a little bit more modern and thin.
And Bert chose the top part.
We did--had our little struggles, and we did--had miscommunications and things like that.
Tome,it 'slikethe wallpaper and curtains at a really tacky catering hall.
Mm-hmm.
Ihatethatdustruffleof gold on the top of it.
It's just, it's really old.
It'salmostlikeinthemovie
The Sound of Music, when they took the drapes off and made their clothes, but like Marie
Antoinette days.
It really does look like curtains.
Ithinkit lookslikeabad costume.
It's terrible.
Idon'tbelievethatthis was what I wanted to present.
Soyouthinkit'shis responsibility.
Ididn'tcreatethis.
Okay.
Viktor, what do you think?
Iownit .
I think we both worked at it at the end and we finished it and--
Sowhenyousay ,"Iownit,"
it means that it was your idea.
Imean,Iown the workwith him because we both did very much 50-50.
"Iownit "?
50-50 is not "I own it."
No,like,no ,notown it.
I guess I'm being responsible for it.
Sothatmeansifthis outfit today is the worst look, you would be the one to go home?
Oh,no.
[Laughs]
No, no.
Well,then,that'snot owning it.
Bert,you'returningslightly lobster color.
Oh,amI?
Sorry.
He was very emphatic about, "I want to do this, we need to do a
Victorian," and I found it unusual that he wouldn't sketch.
He said, "Well, you sketch it.
You sketch better."
Whywouldyounot sketch something?
No,I-I--no,Idid sketch.
No,youtoldme, "Bert,you sketch, you sketch."
It'sinmy HP computer.
Itseemslikeyou two had a lovely day yesterday.
Yes.
Allright,fromone strange look to the next, Fallene and
Bryce, tell us about your outfit.
Ihadtheidea,becausewe were working with such long legs, that we could do a really, really big, kind of full tulle skirt and then we were gonna have cute little details up on the top.
Butliterally,yougavehera
Black Swan.
Yeah.
Idon'tgetit.
Thishasno effortput into it.
It does look like just a tank top that I wear to bed and it looks like a tie wrapped around the waist a couple times.
This just looks like you could have done this in 15 minutes.
Youknow,Ithinktheidea had so much promise.
However, there's nothing.
There's no detail.
It's just the beginning of something.
It's--it's--likeyousaid, it's, like, half done.
Soit'slikenonedone ,then .
Yeah.
Iloveherheadpiece.
I think the headpiece is nice.
Well,I 'msogladImade something.
Ithinktheheadpieceis great.
Listen, to me, it's like she's got every dance reference and it ends up just looking like nothing because they don't meld.
SoBryce,if thiswas the worst look, who do you think should go home?
Um,I thinkbothofus.
I think that--I think this was a team effort.
Unfortunately,itwouldbe only one.
IthinkIshouldbeableto stay.
I did my best.
Iwouldsaymyself.
IwouldsayFallene.
Josh,Julie,tellusabout your look.
Well,I cameup withthe concepts.
Andtheconceptwas circus?
No,itwasmatador.
Ole,ole,ole!
I mean, guys, you know, drama doesn't mean tacky.
Spanishmatador,youcan be inspired by that, you know, and that could be really chic.
You know, we've seen it.
Ijustthinkit'syetanother
Halloween costume.
It's the weirdest hybrid I've ever heard of.
Andshe'sgotthesetiny arms and these extremely long legs.
[Laughter]
It gives her a very bizarre-- when she walked out, I was like, huh.
Forget the matador, circus, and all that.
Theonlypositivethingthat
I could say about this outfit is, it looks well made.
Iagree.
Imean,it is sharp.
That it is, definitely.
So if we decide that this is the worst look for today, who should go home?
Well,itwasmyidea ,andI 'm not gonna throw Josh under the bus.
Whatdoyouthink,Josh ?
Iwouldhopenot togohome, and I would not choose myself.
Soyou'resayingyou would choose Julie.
Yes,I wouldchooseJulie.
Okay,sowe 'veheardwhat you had to say.
We're gonna have a little chat and then I'll call you back out.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Thankyou.
Let'stalkaboutthe designs and the designers that we did like today.
Laura and Anthony Ryan.
Thegarmentreallylooked modern, dramatic, exciting.
Well,itwasthe rightchoice of color, it was the right way to do the pants, and it still looks like a gown.
Ithoughtit wasbeautifulon the model wearing stilts, and I could picture it on a woman without the stilts.
Thatwaspretty.
Then we have Danielle and
Cecilia.
Ihappenedto likethat outfit.
I think it's just really chic.
Andthebeadingwas beautiful.
Theplushereistotakethat chiffon and make something that is finished beautifully.
The chiffon, if you make a mistake, she's in a rag.
DanielleandCecilia,they both know how to sew.
Oh,yeah.
Theydo.
Yousawit here.
BeckyandKimberly.
Thesimpletruthis, they sent out something impeccably tailored.
The pants were fantastic.
Andtheproportionswere right.
Yes.
Italsodidn'tlooklike two designers did something and they stuck it together.
Butrealistically,theyhad a very cohesive look.
Yeah,I thoughtthatit looked like it was done by one person.
Metoo.
Let'stalkaboutthe designers that we didn't like.
Even though it was Julie's idea to make this circus matador outfit, I can still see Josh's bedazzling in there.
They'reanoddteam,when you think about Julie and Josh.
Julie is, you know, rocky, you know, mountain woman, and Josh is like, bedazzle it, glamorous, and kind of those two things together ended up with this insane, very tacky matador outfit.
Yeah.
Youareadesigner.
You're selling design, you're selling taste.
Imean,therewas likeso many details, you didn't know where to look.
It was crazy.
Bryce and Fallene.
Yougetto theBlackSwan /Bob
Fosse combo.
I mean, the hat was the only thing that had any bit of charm or, I don't know, personality.
Itlookedliketwo different eras.
It was like showgirl hat, ballerina--I--you know, it didn't go together at all.
Yeah.
Dance hall girl, modern dance, and ballet, all combined.
What if they hadn't had-- aninspiration.
There was nothing.
It was a promise of an idea, but they couldn't deliver anything.
I mean, I'm not defending Bryce, but I think at least he's got a little more spunk.
Buttheonlythingthat we did like was the hat, and she made the hat.
Ifthehatwasn'tthere,you really would have fallen asleep.
ViktortotallythrewBert under the bus.
He didn't really say it, but he did.
Well,BertthrewViktorunder the bus too.
IjustthinkthatViktoris full of it, and he just--
Idotoo.
Youknow,IbelieveBert when he says he didn't do a drawing and all of that stuff.
Shouldn'tBerthavesaid,
"You know what?
I think this thing is not working."
It's ugly drapes.
I mean, they're ugly drapes.
Awfulfabric.
Everythingbadin thehouse on your body.
Sowe'vemadeour decision?
Okay, let's bring them back out.
Your teams represent the highest and the lowest scores.

South Park 15x08 "Ass Burgers" timing by Fist_Rothbone
That's real funny.
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning talking about the new hit movie
It's a great comedy, it's starring... and...
I saw the movie last night, Big Hairy,
It made me laugh so hard.
This movie is about a... and suddenly all like...
Oh man, it's great.
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning.
We'll talk more about it, but let's get to music.
The new Twin Wave band with their song...
Coming this fall to FOX/CBS/FX,
Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show.
Dinosaurs.
Lost humans.
Future, yeah.
Stanley, eat your waffles.
Shut up Cartman, you don't even know what you're talking about.
I saw it on the news, Kyle.
The school is going to make us all get shots again.
But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vagina.
That's only a vaccination girls, stupid.
Why are they saying that getting vaccinated in school is gonna make us all retarded?
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's.
- Wait, what?
- That's what they're talking about on the news.
Wait, there's a disease called ass burgers?
You are so lying, there is no disease called fucking ass burgers.
You wanna bet?
Let's go ask my dad, right now.
Ok.
And so, children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations and boys will head on out to recess.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
No, butters, that's not how it works.
Mr. Garrison.
These three boys were caught playing hooky.
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called ass burgers?
Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later.
Right now, we're talking about vaginal warts.
This isn't fair, how do the school make us get vaccinated?
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
- That's right, it's a butt fungus.
- I don't want burgers coming out of my butt.
God, shut up!
Everyone just shut the fuck up!
M'kay, stan, you got to try to pull yourself out of this.
M'kay?
I know that your parents recently got divorced.
M'kay?
That's got to be hard.
I know that, that's bail.
When you walk around all mope, m'kay?
Saying everything is just shitty, well... that's called being a Debbie Downer, Stan.
And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay?
I mean you got the snap out of it, Debbie.
Come on Deb, you're even bumming me out now, m'kay?
Your attitude just sucks.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Okay, well that's not gonna happen, Debbie.
Okay, you know life has to change, okay?
How?
When all the things that made you laugh just make you sick, how do you go on when nothing makes you happy?
Excuse me a minute, Stan, m'kay?
Hi, Miss Bronski?
Did we vaccinate Stan Marsh for the flu last year?
We did?
I think he's got Asperger's.
This is Breaking News from CNN.
Or fox or whatever, fuck you.
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's syndrome from school vaccination has put the government in a tight spot.
At a press conference today, the media heard from the young boy's Father, Steamie Ray vaughan.
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent.
An then the government comes along with one shot turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak!
I mean, look at him.
He's disinterested, depressed, self loathing it's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced.
In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed Stan's bill.
Putting an end, to mandated school vaccinations.
Mr. President, the bill's ready.
Just sign right here, Mr. President.
And if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President.
It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted the Asperger's from the vaccinations.
But if so, multimillion dollars source are probably not far behind.
Turn on your heart light, let it shine wherever you go, they make us happy living.
Eric, what is it this time?
Fever, lightheadedness.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
- You don't feel warm.
- Oh, that's a relief.
I thought maybe I had a fever but...
Oh my buns, there's a sharp pain in my buns.
- Can you lay on your stomach?
- I'll try.
What is this?
A hamburger?
A what?
Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Are you serious?
How can there be...
God, you're saying I have ass burgers?
This doesn't make sense.
Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
What are you talking about?
I got vaccinated from this school, and I clearly have ass burgers.
Very funny.
I'm glad you think ass burgers is funny.
- Just know my condition on your record there.
- Get out of my office.
Hey Kyle, have you heard anything at all from Stan?
I've tried, Wendy.
I've called him, I've been to his house, but since his diagnosis all he's done has gotten worse.
I don't know what to do, it's like he's completely turned off.
Those two should just screw and get it over with.
Yeah.
I can't keep doing it, Wendy.
I know he has an illness but goddamn... it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Look, maybe what we should do is go over to his house together
- That way we could...
- No, I can't, Wendy.
All his negativity is starting to make me depressed.
I have to let him go.
And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally positive attitude.
Goddamn stupid school nurse, heartless bitch.
What's the matter, dude?
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing, that's what's the matter.
You made hamburgers?
That's awesome.
I'd love one.
This is really good, Cartman.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Try this hamburger, Cartman made them himself.
Wow, what is that?
Seriously Cartman, you could make money with these.
Jeez, thanks, Kyle.
The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh.
All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.
- Good morning, Mr. Mathers.
- Goodbye, doctor.
It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not.
We've got a new patient, Mark, now I want you to meet Stan.
Nice to meet you.
Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness.
Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because Its of name people think it's a disease to be made fun of.
All right, everyone, let's have a seat.
We'll be done at about 5:00 P.M., Msrs.
Marsh,
- I'll call if it's any earlier.
- Oh, right.
Goodbye Stan, I love you.
- All right, are we clear?
- We're clear.
Watch that window pop.
Everyone make sure this room isn't bugged.
All right Stan, listen up, we don't have a lot of time.
You've been told Asperger's is real, it isn't.
It's just a front we use to stay hidden.
- Wait, it's not a real illness?
- Of course not.
If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's, that's just me.
There's a big war going on out there, Stan.
And we want to you join our fight to bring it all down.
No, no, no.
We're not doing this.
You've broken through their reality and they don't like it.
Others deserve to know the truth.
You see everything as shit, don't you?
Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music all you see and hear is shit.
Am I right?
Yeah.
So do we.
All of us here.
We know the truth, too.
We found way to make it stop, Stan.
Now are you interested?
Or not?
Next order, please.
Get your Cartman Burgers here.
Fresh and flavorful.
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
There you go, Mary.
Turn it back and shake.
- How are we doing those patties?
- About three minutes, fat ass.
Nice.
We're out of finished burgers again, Eric.
We need more.
It's alright, I think another batch is just finishing off in our top secret flavor enhancer.
Come on, Cartman.
As employees don't you think we can see what the secret Favor enhancer is?
I'm sorry Kyle but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be be everywhere.
And we'll have to go back to school.
Now, let me get those hamburgers.
All right, these are good to go.
- All right, is he ready to be sent in?
- He's ready.
Beta levels are normal.
Who are you people?
We're the secret society of cynics.
Everything looks like shit to you, right?
What if I were to tell you that you're seeing the world the way it actually is.
The world around us has all completely turned to shit, but aliens are putting out a brain wave that keeps most people seeing a false reality.
- Aliens?
- Or robots from the future, whatever.
The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
Yeah, everything used to be awesome and cool but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us.
Yeah.
Because of aliens?
Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you.
All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down.
They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you.
Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Let's send him in.
Drink this.
Oh, cool.
Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino.
I think Al Pacino wants to play twister with your sister.
Adam Sandler is funny.
Hey Kyle, you have a visitor.
- Stan?
- Kyle!
Hey, Stan.
Dude, I'm sorry.
I've been a shitty friend, I miss my buddy.
You were right, Adam Sandler is fucking hysterical.
- Stan, are you all right?
- Yeah dude, I totally get it now.
I can see out lame I was saying everything was shit.
Really?
Stan, that's great.
Kyle, it's all shit!
For real.
Everything is shit because of aliens with AI, and you and me are gonna fuck it all.
Come on!
Dude, have you been drinking.
You're not listening to me Kyle.
Dude we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal.
It's too late for that.
Things just can't go back, Stan.
I'm with Cartman Burger now.
Dude, Cartman Burger, seriously?
How shitty is that fucking concept.
See, there you go again.
Look at you dude, look what you become.
- Everything's all right here, Kyle?
- Yeah, fine.
We're gonna need some patties pretty soon.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Come on, Kyle.
- This is about you and me, remember.
- Look dude, things around here have changed.
Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Fuck you, Kyle.
You're a piece of shit.
Kyle, I love you.
You are a piece of shit, though, fuck you.
I love you.
Big harry and mike in the morning in case you didn't catch last night's episode of
- We're breaking it down.
- Oh, Big Hairy, with a...
Oh, no, no, no.
How about we...
He's back.
- Did you see the illusionary world again?
- How did it feel to be back in the matrix?
You feel like total shit.
It's okay, that's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
Try to focus, Stan.
We've found them.
We know where the rock creatures are now.
The rock creatures?
Aliens or AI things, whatever, fuck you.
Dude, I can't...
I can't do any...
He's gonna pop!
Come on kid, wake up, there's not a lot of time left.
You're pushing him too hard.
Oh, God.
Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion.
We're send you back in.
We all know why we are here.
There is a rebellion in our midst, and it must be squashed out.
We have to put an end to Cartman Burgers.
- Yes!
- Let's go!
At KFC, we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
It's worst at Pizza Hut, Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
What makes them so good?
Whatever reason is, Cartman Burgers satisfied taste craving for all of our restaurants.
Realize the secret, it's a chemical compound of all our flavors.
Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC all somehow infused into one burger.
It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredient of our food.
Breaking them down in to some kind of gas, and then somehow infusing that gas into his hamburger.
What kind of instrument can he be using to do this?
They would have to be some kind of super Dutch oven.
But a dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen.
Hey!
Wake up.
Come on, can wake up.
Use the smelling sauce.
Enchirito?
You know the secret?
What?
You guys are aliens?
Stop playing with us!
What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?
Dude, I don't know!
He's lying.
You see this kid in the picture?
This guy is his best friend.
I'm not friends with him.
They have been through everything together, inseparable.
No, no, we don't hang on anymore.
All right.
Like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that.
Dude, I didn't walk away.
I turned ten and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me so I...
Oh, sure.
Anyone would dish out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good.
Now, stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers are so delicious.
I don't know.
All right.
I guess we'll have to do this the hard way.
There's ten mediums and five medium rares.
All right, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Next, please.
Kyle, you gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
- What are you doing?
- How do you guys make them so yummy?
I don't know.
You better get him to tell you or you're going to get shot in the back of the head.
You get that?
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Why?
So that we lose our business and everything can go back to old times?
No, because there's aliens with a sniper chicken on me.
Oh, God.
Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I'm sorry.
But your negativity is poison to me.
All right.
Like a friend would walk out on somebody who's diagnosed with a serious illness.
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out.
- But it's not my fault.
- You said fuck you to my face, Stan.
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Yeah, right.
Like any friend would say something that severe then try to take it back.
All right, look, I honestly don't know the secret, dude.
Only Cartman does and that's how it's gonna work for us.
God, dammit, this is getting us nowhere.
Everyone get back.
You want to play hard ball, that's fine.
Let's see this mighty machine once and for all.
You vampire sons of bitches!
All right, nice work, Stan.
Now comes the final step.
You have to take out duck president.
Just stop it.
You people are so full of shit.
Looks like the serum is clearing off.
You better take some more.
No, I'm done with that.
But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was.
I don't.
You were right, Kyle.
Sometimes the only way to go forward is to take a big left turn.
I've been resisting it but I'm ready now.
I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude.
It's okay.
You're gonna do this, and I'm gonna to do my thing and my mom and dad aren't getting back together.
You know what?
It's okay.
In fact, it's better.
Change is gonna bring new things for all of us.
Where will Cartman Burger go from here?
That will be cool to see.
It opens me up to whole new adventures, exploring new relationships with all new people in town.
Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.
Or maybe this kid will.
Maybe it won't be like before, but at least it'll all be new.
And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going.
For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited.
Stan!
Stan!
Get in the car, Stan.
Your mom and I are moving back in together.
- What?
- We worked it out, pal, surprise!
No, dad, no.
No, please.
We talked a lot and we know it's what's best for you kids.
And, I don't know.
No, mom, sometimes you gotta left turn.
People get older, Stanley.
And as you get older you realize the best thing to do is just stick with what you know.
Wou were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning, talking about "Two and A Half Men"
I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
And what about that movie "Dolphin Tale", I'm psyched for that.
It's Big Hairy and Mike in the morning.
Let's hear one from the band Sladjammer and their song...

Zookeeper 2, Zoo Creepier!
Okay, coming.
That's funny.
That's real funny.

It made me laugh so hard.
This movie is about a...
He's suddenly all like... it's great.

The new Tween Wave band... with their song...
Coming this fall to Fox CBS FX.

Dinosaur.
Lost human.
Future yet...
Eat your waffles.
Shut up.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I saw it on the news.
The school is gonna make us all get shots again.
so we don't get warts in our vaginas.
Are you serious?
stupid.
Then why are they saying it's gonna make us all retarded?
Some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's.
273)}– What?
– That's what they're talking about.
There's a disease called Asperger's?
You are so lying.
There's no fucking Asperger's.
You wanna bet?
Let's go ask my dad right now.
Jew. and boys will head on out to recess.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
That's not how it works.
These three boys were caught playing hookey.
Did you know there's actually a disease called Asperger's?
boys.
We'll talk about this later.
we're talking about vaginal warts.
How can the school make us get vaccinated?
it's a butt fungus.
I don't want burgers coming out of my butt.
shut up!
Everyone just shut the fuck up!
You got to try and pull yourself out of this.
I know that your parents recently got divorced.
That's got to be hard.
I know that's bad. that's called being a Debbie Downer.
And nobody likes a Debbie Downer.
Debbie.
Deb.
You're even bumming me out now.
Your attitude just sucks.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Debbie.
life has to change.
How? just make you sick.
How do you go on when nothing makes you happy?
Excuse me a minute.
Did we vaccinate Stan Marsh for the flu last year?
We did?
I think he's got Asperger's.
fuck you.
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's syndrome from school vaccinations has put the government in a tight spot.
Steamy Ray Vaughn. turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak.
Look at him.
self-loathing.
It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced. putting an end to mandated school vaccinations.
The bill is ready.
Mr. President.
And if you could sign this one as well?
It is yet unknown if any other children multimillion dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
What is it this time?
lightheadedness.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
You don't feel warm.
but...
My buns.
A sharp pain in my buns!
273)}– Can you lay on your stomach?
– I'll try.
What the?
What is this?
A hamburger?
A what?
Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Are you serious?
How could there be... my God!
You're saying I have ass burgers?
This doesn't make sense.
Are you trying to sneak food?
What are you talking about?
I got vaccinated.
I have ass burgers.
– Very funny.
I'm glad you think it's funny.
273)}– Note my condition on your record.
– Get out of my office.
Have you heard from Stan?
I tried.
I've called him.
I've been to his house.
all he's done is gotten worse.
I don't know what to do.
It's like he's completely turned off.
Those two should just screw and it over with.
I can't keep doing it. it's like being around a black hole that sucks the life out of everything.
We should all go over to his house.
we could...
– I can't.
All his negativity is starting to make me depressed.
I have to let him go.
I'm going to embrace with a totally positive attitude.
God damn stupid school nurse.
Heartless bitch.
What's the matter?
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing.
You made hamburgers?
That's awesome!
I'd love one.
273)}– This is really good.
– Really?
try this hamburger.
Cartman made them himself.
What is that?
you could make money with these.
We still know very little about Asperger's syndrome.
All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.
doctor.
It's as if they can't distinguish what is socially acceptable and what is not.
Martin.
I want you to meet Stan.
Nice to meet you.
our focus is on awareness. people think it's a disease to be made fun of.
everyone.
Let's have a seat.
We'll be done at about 5 pm.
I'll call if it's any earlier.
All right.
Stan.
I love you.
273)}– Are we clear?
– We're clear.
Watch that window.
Make sure this room isn't bugged.
We don't have a lot of time.
You've been told Asperger's is real.
It isn't.
It's just a front that we use to stay hidden.
273)}– It's not a real illness?
– Of course not.
you wouldn't call it Asperger's.
That's just mean.
There's a big war going on out there.
We want you to join our fight to bring it all down.
We're not doing this.
You've broken through their reality.
They don't like it.
don't you? right?
So do we.
All of us here.
We know the truth too.
We found a way to make it stop.
are you interested or not?
please.
Get your Cartman Burgers here.
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
and a bag of chips.
fatass.
Nice.
We're out of finished burgers again.
We need more.
Another batch is just finishing up in our top secret flavor enhancer.
Come on.
Don't you think we should get to see what the secret flavor enhancer is?
our patented flavor will be everywhere.
And we'll have to go back to school.
Let me get those hamburgers.
These are good to go.
Is he ready to be sent in?
He's ready.
Beta levels are normal.
273)}– Who are you people?
– We're the secret society of cynics.
right? that you're seeing the world the way it actually is? but aliens are putting out a brain wave to keep people seeing a false reality.
whatever.
The point is they keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance. and nobody knows except us.
Because of aliens?
Or genetically altered humans.
Whatever.
Fuck you.
All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down.
but they won't be expecting you.
Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world?
273)}– I'm ready.
– Let's send him in.
Drink this.
Cool!
you got a date with Al Pacino?
I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
Adam Sandler's funny.
You have a visitor.
I'm sorry.
I've been a shitty friend.
I miss my buddy.
You were right.
Adam Sandler is fucking hysterical.
273)}– Are you all right?
– I totally get it now.
saying everything was shit.
Really?
That's great.
for reals.
Because of aliens with AI.
You and me are gonna fuck it all.
273)}– Have you been drinking?
– You're not listening to me.
then everything can go back to normal.
It's too late for that.
Things just can't go back.
I'm with Cartman Burger now.
Cartman Burger?
Seriously?
How shitty is that fucking concept?
There you go again.
Look what you've become.
273)}– Everything all right here?
– It's fine.
273)}– We're gonna need some more patties.
– I'll be right there.
remember?
Things around here have changed.
the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Fuck you.
You're a piece of shit.
I love you.
You're a piece of shit though.
Fuck you.
I love you.
Big Harry and Mike in the morning.
we're breaking it down.
we... right into the...
How about we...
He's back.
273)}– Did you see the illusionary world?
– How was it to be back in the Matrix?
I feel like total shit.
That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
Try and focus.
We found them.
We know where the rock creatures are.
The rock creatures?
Or aliens or AI... dang.
Whatever.
Fuck you.
I can't... 273)}– I can't do any...
– He's gonna pop.
Wake up.
There's not a lot of time left.
You're pushing him too hard.
God.
You have to convince people they're in a world of illusion.
We are sending you back in.
We all know why we are here.
and it must be squashed out.
We have to put an end to Cartman Burgers.
273)}– Yes!
– What are we going to do?
we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
It's worse at Pizza Hut.
They choked out the market.
What makes them so good?
These burgers satisfy the cravings for all of our restaurants.
There lies the secret.
It's the chemical compound of all of our flavors.
all somehow infused into one burger. then somehow infusing that gas into his hamburger.
What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?
It would have to be some kind of super Dutch oven.
A Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen.
wake up.
Use the smelling salts.
Enchirito?
273)}– You know the secret?
– What?
You guys are aliens?
Stop playing with us.
What's the secret to Cartman Burger's amazing taste?
273)}– I don't know.
– He's lying.
You see this kid in the picture?
This guy is his best friend.
We're not friends.
They've been through everything together.
We don't hang out anymore.
Right.
Like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that.
I didn't walk away.
so I... because they weren't feeling good.
Stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers are so delicious.
I don't know!
I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way.
There's ten mediums and five medium rares.
I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
please.
You got to tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
What are you doing?
273)}– How do you make them so yummy?
– I don't know.
or you're getting shot in the head.
273)}– You got that?
– Just tell me the secret.
So that we lose our business and everything go back to old times?
Because there's aliens with a sniper chicken on me.
God. but your negativity is poison to me.
Right.
Like a friend would walk out because of a serious illness.
I'm sorry I've been bumming you out.
But it's not my fault.
You said "fuck you" to my face.
I didn't realize what I was saying.
Like any friend would say something that severe then try to take it back.
I honestly don't know the secret.
and that's how it's gonna work for us.
this is getting us nowhere.
that's fine.
Let's see this mighty machine once and for all.
You vampire sons of bitches!
nice work.
Now comes the final step.
You have to take out Duck President.
Just stop it.
You people are so full of shit.
Looks like the serum is wearing off.
You better take some more.
I'm done with that.
You have to take down the bad guys and go through a transformation so that everything can go back to the way it was.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!
I don't.
You were right.
the only way to go forward is to take a big left turn.
but I'm ready now.
I want you to stay with Cartman Burger.
and I'm gonna do my thing.
My mom and dad aren't getting back together.
But you know what?
It's OK.
it's better.
Change is gonna bring new things for all of us.
Where will Cartman go from here?
That will be cool to see. exploring new relationships with all new people in town.
Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.
Or maybe this kid will.
but at least it will all be new.
And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going.
I'm really excited.
Get in the car.
Your mom and I are moving back in.
pal.
Surprise!
please.
and we know it's what's best for you kids...
I don't know.
you gotta...
left turn.
People get older.
you realize the best thing to do is just stick with what you know.
You were sticking these in your ass?
That's good.
I like that.
Big Harry and Mike in the morning talking about Two and a Half Men.
I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen.
What about that movie Dolphin Tale?
I'm psyched for that.
Dolphin Tale.
Big Harry and Mike in the morning.
and their song...
We're gonna go see the new Zookeeper movie.
Zookeeper 2:
Zookeepier.
coming.
That's funny.
That's real funny.
talking about the new hit movie...
Great comedy.
Starring... and...
Big Hairy.
It made me laugh so hard.
This movie is about a...
He's suddenly all like... it's great.
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning.
We'll talk about it.
But let's get to some music.
The new Tween Wave band... with their song...
Coming this fall to Fox CBS FX.
Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show.
Dinosaur.
Lost human.
Future yet...
Eat your waffles.
Shut up.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I saw it on the news.
The school is gonna make us all get shots again.
so we don't get warts in our vaginas.
Are you serious?
stupid.
Then why are they saying it's gonna make us all retarded?
Some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's.
273)}– What?
– That's what they're talking about.
There's a disease called Asperger's?
You are so lying.
There's no fucking Asperger's.
You wanna bet?
Let's go ask my dad right now.
Jew. and boys will head on out to recess.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
That's not how it works.
These three boys were caught playing hookey.
Did you know there's actually a disease called Asperger's?
boys.
We'll talk about this later.
we're talking about vaginal warts.
How can the school make us get vaccinated?
it's a butt fungus.
I don't want burgers coming out of my butt.
shut up!
Everyone just shut the fuck up!
You got to try and pull yourself out of this.
I know that your parents recently got divorced.
That's got to be hard.
I know that's bad. that's called being a Debbie Downer.
And nobody likes a Debbie Downer.
Debbie.
Deb.
You're even bumming me out now.
Your attitude just sucks.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Debbie.
life has to change.
How? just make you sick.
How do you go on when nothing makes you happy?
Excuse me a minute.
Did we vaccinate Stan Marsh for the flu last year?
We did?
I think he's got Asperger's.
fuck you.
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's syndrome from school vaccinations has put the government in a tight spot.
Steamy Ray Vaughn. turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak.
Look at him.
self-loathing.
It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced. putting an end to mandated school vaccinations.
The bill is ready.
Mr. President.
And if you could sign this one as well?
It is yet unknown if any other children multimillion dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
What is it this time?
lightheadedness.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
You don't feel warm.
but...
My buns.
A sharp pain in my buns!
273)}– Can you lay on your stomach?
– I'll try.
What the?
What is this?
A hamburger?
A what?
Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Are you serious?

Dinosaurs.
Lost humans.
Future, yeah.
Stanley, eat your waffles.
Shut up Cartman, you don't even know what you're talking about.
I saw it on the news, Kyle.
The school is going to make us all get shots again.
But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vagina.
That's only a vaccination girls, stupid.
Why are they saying that getting vaccinated in school is gonna make us all retarded?
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's.
- Wait, what?
- That's what they're talking about on the news.
Wait, there's a disease called ass burgers?
You are so lying, there is no disease called fucking ass burgers.
You wanna bet?
Let's go ask my dad, right now.
Ok.
And so, children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations and boys will head on out to recess.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
No, butters, that's not how it works.
Mr. Garrison.
These three boys were caught playing hooky.
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called ass burgers?
Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later.
Right now, we're talking about vaginal warts.
This isn't fair, how do the school make us get vaccinated?
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
- That's right, it's a butt fungus.
- I don't want burgers coming out of my butt.
God, shut up!
Everyone just shut the fuck up!
M'kay, stan, you got to try to pull yourself out of this.
M'kay?
I know that your parents recently got divorced.
M'kay?
That's got to be hard.
I know that, that's bail.
When you walk around all mope, m'kay?
Saying everything is just shitty, well... that's called being a Debbie Downer, Stan.
And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay?
I mean you got the snap out of it, Debbie.
Come on Deb, you're even bumming me out now, m'kay?
Your attitude just sucks.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Okay, well that's not gonna happen, Debbie.
Okay, you know life has to change, okay?
How?
When all the things that made you laugh just make you sick, how do you go on when nothing makes you happy?
Excuse me a minute, Stan, m'kay?
Hi, Miss Bronski?
Did we vaccinate Stan Marsh for the flu last year?
We did?
I think he's got Asperger's.
This is Breaking News from CNN.
Or fox or whatever, fuck you.
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's syndrome from school vaccination has put the government in a tight spot.
At a press conference today, the media heard from the young boy's Father, Steamie Ray vaughan.
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent.
An then the government comes along with one shot turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak!
I mean, look at him.
He's disinterested, depressed, self loathing it's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced.
In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed Stan's bill.
Putting an end, to mandated school vaccinations.
Mr. President, the bill's ready.
Just sign right here, Mr. President.
And if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President.
It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted the Asperger's from the vaccinations.
But if so, multimillion dollars source are probably not far behind.
Turn on your heart light, let it shine wherever you go, they make us happy living.
Eric, what is it this time?
Fever, lightheadedness.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
- You don't feel warm.
- Oh, that's a relief.
I thought maybe I had a fever but...
Oh my buns, there's a sharp pain in my buns.
- Can you lay on your stomach?
- I'll try.
What is this?
A hamburger?
A what?
Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Are you serious?
How can there be...
God, you're saying I have ass burgers?
This doesn't make sense.
Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
What are you talking about?
I got vaccinated from this school, and I clearly have ass burgers.
Very funny.
I'm glad you think ass burgers is funny.
- Just know my condition on your record there.
- Get out of my office.
Hey Kyle, have you heard anything at all from Stan?
I've tried, Wendy.
I've called him, I've been to his house, but since his diagnosis all he's done has gotten worse.
I don't know what to do, it's like he's completely turned off.
Those two should just screw and get it over with.
Yeah.
I can't keep doing it, Wendy.
I know he has an illness but goddamn... it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Look, maybe what we should do is go over to his house together
- That way we could...
- No, I can't, Wendy.
All his negativity is starting to make me depressed.
I have to let him go.
And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally positive attitude.
Goddamn stupid school nurse, heartless bitch.
What's the matter, dude?
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing, that's what's the matter.
You made hamburgers?
That's awesome.
I'd love one.
This is really good, Cartman.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Try this hamburger, Cartman made them himself.
Wow, what is that?
Seriously Cartman, you could make money with these.
Jeez, thanks, Kyle.
The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh.
All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.
- Good morning, Mr. Mathers.
- Goodbye, doctor.
It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not.
We've got a new patient, Mark, now I want you to meet Stan.
Nice to meet you.
Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness.
Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because Its of name people think it's a disease to be made fun of.
All right, everyone, let's have a seat.
We'll be done at about 5:00 P.M., Msrs.
Marsh,
- I'll call if it's any earlier.
- Oh, right.
Goodbye Stan, I love you.
- All right, are we clear?
- We're clear.
Watch that window pop.
Everyone make sure this room isn't bugged.
All right Stan, listen up, we don't have a lot of time.
You've been told Asperger's is real, it isn't.
It's just a front we use to stay hidden.
- Wait, it's not a real illness?
- Of course not.
If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's, that's just me.
There's a big war going on out there, Stan.
And we want to you join our fight to bring it all down.
No, no, no.
We're not doing this.
You've broken through their reality and they don't like it.
Others deserve to know the truth.
You see everything as shit, don't you?
Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music all you see and hear is shit.
Am I right?
Yeah.
So do we.
All of us here.
We know the truth, too.
We found way to make it stop, Stan.
Now are you interested?
Or not?
Next order, please.
Get your Cartman Burgers here.
Fresh and flavorful.
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
There you go, Mary.
Turn it back and shake.
- How are we doing those patties?
- About three minutes, fat ass.
Nice.
We're out of finished burgers again, Eric.
We need more.
It's alright, I think another batch is just finishing off in our top secret flavor enhancer.
Come on, Cartman.
As employees don't you think we can see what the secret Favor enhancer is?
I'm sorry Kyle but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be be everywhere.
And we'll have to go back to school.
Now, let me get those hamburgers.
All right, these are good to go.
- All right, is he ready to be sent in?
- He's ready.
Beta levels are normal.
Who are you people?
We're the secret society of cynics.
Everything looks like shit to you, right?
What if I were to tell you that you're seeing the world the way it actually is.
The world around us has all completely turned to shit, but aliens are putting out a brain wave that keeps most people seeing a false reality.
- Aliens?
- Or robots from the future, whatever.
The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
Yeah, everything used to be awesome and cool but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us.
Yeah.
Because of aliens?
Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you.
All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down.
They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you.
Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Let's send him in.
Drink this.
Oh, cool.
Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino.
I think Al Pacino wants to play twister with your sister.
Adam Sandler is funny.
Hey Kyle, you have a visitor.
- Stan?
- Kyle!
Hey, Stan.
Dude, I'm sorry.
I've been a shitty friend, I miss my buddy.
You were right, Adam Sandler is fucking hysterical.
- Stan, are you all right?
- Yeah dude, I totally get it now.
I can see out lame I was saying everything was shit.
Really?
Stan, that's great.
Kyle, it's all shit!
For real.
Everything is shit because of aliens with AI, and you and me are gonna fuck it all.
Come on!
Dude, have you been drinking.
You're not listening to me Kyle.
Dude we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal.
It's too late for that.
Things just can't go back, Stan.
I'm with Cartman Burger now.
Dude, Cartman Burger, seriously?
How shitty is that fucking concept.
See, there you go again.
Look at you dude, look what you become.
- Everything's all right here, Kyle?
- Yeah, fine.
We're gonna need some patties pretty soon.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Come on, Kyle.
- This is about you and me, remember.
- Look dude, things around here have changed.
Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Fuck you, Kyle.
You're a piece of shit.
Kyle, I love you.
You are a piece of shit, though, fuck you.
I love you.
Big harry and mike in the morning in case you didn't catch last night's episode of
- We're breaking it down.
- Oh, Big Hairy, with a...
Oh, no, no, no.
How about we...
He's back.
- Did you see the illusionary world again?
- How did it feel to be back in the matrix?
You feel like total shit.
It's okay, that's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
Try to focus, Stan.
We've found them.
We know where the rock creatures are now.
The rock creatures?
Aliens or AI things, whatever, fuck you.
Dude, I can't...
I can't do any...
He's gonna pop!
Come on kid, wake up, there's not a lot of time left.
You're pushing him too hard.
Oh, God.
Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion.
We're send you back in.
We all know why we are here.
There is a rebellion in our midst, and it must be squashed out.
We have to put an end to Cartman Burgers.
- Yes!
- Let's go!
At KFC, we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
It's worst at Pizza Hut, Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
What makes them so good?
Whatever reason is, Cartman Burgers satisfied taste craving for all of our restaurants.
Realize the secret, it's a chemical compound of all our flavors.
Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC all somehow infused into one burger.
It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredient of our food.
Breaking them down in to some kind of gas, and then somehow infusing that gas into his hamburger.
What kind of instrument can he be using to do this?
They would have to be some kind of super Dutch oven.
But a dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen.
Hey!
Wake up.
Come on, can wake up.
Use the smelling sauce.
Enchirito?
You know the secret?
What?
You guys are aliens?
Stop playing with us!
What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?
Dude, I don't know!
He's lying.
You see this kid in the picture?
This guy is his best friend.
I'm not friends with him.
They have been through everything together, inseparable.
No, no, we don't hang on anymore.
All right.
Like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that.
Dude, I didn't walk away.
I turned ten and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me so I...
Oh, sure.
Anyone would dish out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good.
Now, stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers are so delicious.
I don't know.
All right.
I guess we'll have to do this the hard way.
There's ten mediums and five medium rares.
All right, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Next, please.
Kyle, you gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
- What are you doing?
- How do you guys make them so yummy?
I don't know.
You better get him to tell you or you're going to get shot in the back of the head.
You get that?
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Why?
So that we lose our business and everything can go back to old times?
No, because there's aliens with a sniper chicken on me.
Oh, God.
Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I'm sorry.
But your negativity is poison to me.
All right.
Like a friend would walk out on somebody who's diagnosed with a serious illness.
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out.
- But it's not my fault.
- You said fuck you to my face, Stan.
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Yeah, right.
Like any friend would say something that severe then try to take it back.
All right, look, I honestly don't know the secret, dude.
Only Cartman does and that's how it's gonna work for us.
God, dammit, this is getting us nowhere.
Everyone get back.
You want to play hard ball, that's fine.
Let's see this mighty machine once and for all.
You vampire sons of bitches!
All right, nice work, Stan.
Now comes the final step.
You have to take out duck president.
Just stop it.
You people are so full of shit.
Looks like the serum is clearing off.
You better take some more.
No, I'm done with that.
But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was.
I don't.
You were right, Kyle.
Sometimes the only way to go forward is to take a big left turn.
I've been resisting it but I'm ready now.
I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude.
It's okay.
You're gonna do this, and I'm gonna to do my thing and my mom and dad aren't getting back together.
You know what?
It's okay.
In fact, it's better.
Change is gonna bring new things for all of us.
Where will Cartman Burger go from here?
That will be cool to see.
It opens me up to whole new adventures, exploring new relationships with all new people in town.
Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.
Or maybe this kid will.
Maybe it won't be like before, but at least it'll all be new.
And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going.
For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited.
Stan!
Stan!
Get in the car, Stan.
Your mom and I are moving back in together.
- What?
- We worked it out, pal, surprise!
No, dad, no.
No, please.
We talked a lot and we know it's what's best for you kids.
And, I don't know.
No, mom, sometimes you gotta left turn.
People get older, Stanley.
And as you get older you realize the best thing to do is just stick with what you know.
Wou were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning, talking about "Two and A Half Men"
I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
And what about that movie "Dolphin Tale", I'm psyched for that.
It's Big Hairy and Mike in the morning.
Let's hear one from the band Sladjammer and their song...
Dude, we're going to see the new Zookeeper movie.
Zookeeper 2, Zoo Creepier!
Okay, coming.
Encoded by NIT158
That's real funny.
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning talking about the new hit movie
It's a great comedy, it's starring... and...
I saw the movie last night, Big Hairy, it made me laugh so hard.
This movie is about a... and suddenly all like...
Oh man, it's great.
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning.
We'll talk more about it, but let's get to music.
The new Twin Wave band with their song...
Coming this fall to FOX/CBS/FX,
Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show.
Dinosaurs.
Lost humans.
Future, yeah.
Stanley, eat your waffles.
Shut up Cartman, you don't even know what you're talking about.
I saw it on the news, Kyle.
The school is going to make us all get shots again.
But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vagina.
That's only a vaccination girls, stupid.
Why are they saying that getting vaccinated in school is gonna make us all retarded?
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's.
- Wait, what?
- That's what they're talking about on the news.
Wait, there's a disease called ass burgers?
You are so lying, there is no disease called fucking ass burgers.
You wanna bet?
Let's go ask my dad, right now.
Ok.
And so, children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations and boys will head on out to recess.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
No, butters, that's not how it works.
Mr. Garrison.
These three boys were caught playing hooky.
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called ass burgers?
Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later.
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
- That's right, it's a butt fungus.
- I don't want burgers coming out of my butt.
God, shut up!
Everyone just shut the fuck up!
M'kay, stan, you got to try to pull yourself out of this.
M'kay?
I know that your parents recently got divorced.
M'kay?
That's got to be hard.
I know that, that's bail.
When you walk around all mope, m'kay?
Saying everything is just shitty, well... that's called being a Debbie Downer, Stan.
And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay?
I mean you got the snap out of it, Debbie.
Come on Deb, you're even bumming me out now, m'kay?
Your attitude just sucks.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Okay, well that's not gonna happen, Debbie.
Okay, you know life has to change, okay?
How?
When all the things that made you laugh just make you sick, how do you go on when nothing makes you happy?
Excuse me a minute, Stan, m'kay?
Hi, Miss Bronski?
Did we vaccinate Stan Marsh for the flu last year?
We did?
I think he's got Asperger's.
This is Breaking News from CNN.
Or fox or whatever, fuck you.
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's syndrome from school vaccination has put the government in a tight spot.
At a press conference today, the media heard from the young boy's Father, Steamie Ray vaughan.
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent.
An then the government comes along with one shot turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak!
I mean, look at him.
He's disinterested, depressed, self loathing it's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced.
In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed Stan's bill.
Putting an end, to mandated school vaccinations.
Mr. President, the bill's ready.
Just sign right here, Mr. President.
And if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President.
It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted the Asperger's from the vaccinations.
But if so, multimillion dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
Turn on your heart light, let it shine wherever you go, they make us happy living.
Eric, what is it this time?
Fever, lightheadedness.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
- You don't feel warm.
- Oh, that's a relief.
I thought maybe I had a fever but...
Oh my buns, there's a sharp pain in my buns.
- Can you lay on your stomach?
- I'll try.
What is this?
A hamburger?
A what?
Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Are you serious?
How can there be...
God, you're saying I have ass burgers?
This doesn't make sense.
Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
What are you talking about?
I got vaccinated from this school, and I clearly have ass burgers.
Very funny.
I'm glad you think ass burgers is funny.
- Just know my condition on your record there.
- Get out of my office.
Hey Kyle, have you heard anything at all from Stan?
I've tried, Wendy.
I've called him, I've been to his house, but since his diagnosis all he's done has gotten worse.
I don't know what to do, it's like he's completely turned off.
Those two should just screw and get it over with.
Yeah.
I can't keep doing it, Wendy.
I know he has an illness but goddamn... it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Look, maybe what we should do is go over to his house together
- That way we could...
- No, I can't, Wendy.
All his negativity is starting to make me depressed.
I have to let him go.
And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally positive attitude.
Goddamn stupid school nurse, heartless bitch.
What's the matter, dude?
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing, that's what's the matter.
You made hamburgers?
That's awesome.
I'd love one.
This is really good, Cartman.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Try this hamburger, Cartman made them himself.
Wow, what is that?
Seriously Cartman, you could make money with these.
Jeez, thanks, Kyle.
The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh.

Change is gonna bring new things for all of us.
Where will Cartman Burger go from here?
That will be cool to see.
It opens me up to whole new adventures, exploring new relationships with all new people in town.
Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.

Get in the car, Stan.
Your mom and I are moving back in together.
- What?
- We worked it out, pal, surprise!
No, dad, no.
No, please.
We talked a lot and we know it's what's best for you kids.
And, I don't know.
No, mom, sometimes you gotta left turn.
People get older, Stanley.
And as you get older you realize the best thing to do is just stick with what you know.
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?
Big Hairy and Mike in the morning, talking about "Two and A Half Men"
I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
And what about that movie "Dolphin Tale", I'm psyched for that.
It's Big Hairy and Mike in the morning.
Let's hear one from the band Sladjammer and their song...
Dude, we're going to see the new Zookeeper movie.
Zookeeper 2, Zoo Creepier!
Okay, coming.
That's funny.
I like that!
Big Harry and Mike in the morning talking about the new hit movie... .
It's a great comedy.
It's starring... and .
I saw the movie last night, Big Harry, and it made me laugh so hard!
This movie is about a...
Who's suddenly all like... .
Oh, that's funny.
That's real funny.
Big Harry and Mike in the morning.
We'll talk more about it, but let's get to some music.
The new tween wave band...
With their song... .
Coming this fall to Fox/CBS/FX,
Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show!
Dinosaurs.
Lost humans.
Future, yeah. .
Stanley, eat your waffles.
Oh, shut up, Cartman.
You don't even know what you're talking about.
Oh, yeah?
I saw it on the news, Kyle.
The school is gonna make us all get shots again, but this time, it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas.
- Are you serious?
- Yep.
That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid.
Then why are they saying that getting vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's.
Wait.
What?
That's what they're talking about on the news.
Wait.
There's a disease called ass burgers?
- Yes!
- You are so lying!
There is no disease called fucking ass burgers.
You want to bet?
Let's go ask my dad right now.
Okay, you're on, Jew!
And so, children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess.
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
No, Butters, that's not how it works.
Mr. Garrison, these three boys were caught playing hooky.
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called ass burgers?
Sit down, boys.
We'll talk about this later.
Right now, we're talking about vaginal warts.
This isn't fair!
How can the school make us get vaccinated?
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
That's right.
It's a butt fungus.
I don't want burgers coming out of my butt.
God, shut up!
Everyone, just shut the fuck up!
Okay, Stan, you got to try and pull yourself out of this, mkay?
I know that your parents recently got divorced, mkay.
That's got to be hard.
I know that... that's bad.
But when you walk around all mopey, mkay, and saying everything is just shitty, well, that's called being a Debbie Downer, Stan.
And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, mkay?
I mean, you got to- you got to snap out of it, Debbie.
Come on, Deb, you're even bumming me out now, mkay?
Your attitude just... just sucks.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie.
Okay, you know, life has to change, mkay?
How?
When all the things that made you laugh just make you sick, how do you go on when nothing makes you happy?
Huh.
Excuse me a minute, Stan, mkay?
Uh, hi, Miss Bronski?
Did we vaccinate Stan Marsh for the flu last year?
We did?
Uh-oh.
I think he's got Asperger's.
This is breaking news from CNN... or Fox or whatever.
Fuck you.
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's syndrome from school vaccinations has put the government in a tight spot.
As press conference today, the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent and then the government comes along and, with one shot, turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak!
I mean, look at him!
He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing.
It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced.
In response to the embarrassment, the president of the United States has passed Stan's Bill, putting an end to mandated school vaccinations.
Mr. President, the bill ready.
Just sign right here, Mr. President.
And if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President.
It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted Asperger's from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
* Turn on your heart light *
* Let it shine wherever you go *
* Let it make a happy glow *
Eric, what is it this time?
Fever, light...
light-headedness.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
You don't feel warm.
Oh, that's a relief.
I thought maybe I had a fever, but I... - oh, oh, my buns!
There's a sharp pain in my buns!
Can you lay on your stomach?
I'll try.
I'll try.
What the-
What is this, a hamburger?
A what?
Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Are you serious?
How could there be-
Oh, my God!
You're saying I have ass burgers?
This doesn't make sense.
Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
What are you talking about?
I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have ass burgers.
Very funny.
Well, I'm glad you think ass burgers is funny.
Just note my condition on your records there.
Get out of my office.
Hey, Kyle, have you heard anything at all from Stan?
I've tried, Wendy.
I've called him.
I've been to his house.
But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
I don't know what to do.
It's like he's completely turned off.
Those two should just screw and get it over with.
Yeah.
I can't keep doing it, Wendy.
I know he has an illness, but goddamn.
It's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together.
- That way we could-
- No, I can't, Wendy.
All his negativity is starting to make me depressed.
I have to let him go.
And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally positive attitude.
Goddamn stupid school nurse!
Heartless bitch!
What's the matter, dude?
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing!
That's what's the matter!
You made hamburgers?
That's awesome.
I'd love one.
Mmm!
Hmm, wow!
This is really good, Cartman.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, Riley, try this hamburger.
Cartman made them himself.
Wow!
What is that?
Seriously, Cartman, you could make money with these.
Gee, thanks, Kyle.
The truth is, we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh.
All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.
Good morning, Mr. Mathers.
Good-bye...
Doctor.
It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not.
We've got a new patient, Martin.
I want to you meet Stan.
Nice to meet you.
Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness.
Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately, because of its name, people think it's a disease to be made fun of.
All right, everyone, let's have a seat.
Oh, we'll be done at about 5:00 p.m., Mrs. Marsh.
I'll call if it's any earlier.
Oh, right.
Good-bye, Stan.
I love you.
All right, are we clear?
We're clear.
Watch that window, Puck.
Everyone make sure this room isn't bugged.
All right, Stan, listen up.
We don't have a lot of time.
You've been told Asperger's is real.
It isn't.
It's just a front that we use to stay hidden.
Wait.
It's not a real illness?
Of course not!
If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it "ass burgers."
That's just... that's just mean.
There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want to you to join our fight to bring it all down.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're not doing this.
You've broken through their reality, and they don't like it.
Others deserve to know the truth.
You see everything as shit, don't you?
Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit.
Am I right?
Yeah.
So do we, all of us here.
We know the truth too.
We found way to make it stop, Stan.
Now, are you interested or not?
Next order, please.
Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
There you go, Molly.
And a bag of chips.
Thanks.
How we doing on those patties, Jew?
- About three minutes, fat-ass.
- Nice.
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric.
- We need more.
- It's all right.
I think another batch is just finishing off in our top secret flavor enhancer.
Dude, come on, Cartman.
As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
I'm sorry, Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school.
Now, let me get those hamburgers.
All right, these are good to go.
All right, is he ready to be sent in?
He's ready.
Beta levels are normal.
Who are you people?
We're the secret society of cynics.
Everything looks like shit to you, right?
What if I were to tell you that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?
Huh?
The world around us has all completely turned to shit, but aliens are putting out a brain wave that keeps most people seeing a false reality.
Aliens?
Or robots from the future.
Whatever.
The point is, they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
Yeah, everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit, and nobody knows except us.
Yeah.
Because of aliens?
Or genetically altered humans.
Whatever.
Fuck you.
All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down.
They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you.
Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Let's send him in.
Drink this.
Ahh!
Oh, cool!
Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?
I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
Adam Sandler's funny!
Hey, Kyle, you have a visitor.
Stan?
- Kyle!
- Hey, Stan.
Dude, I'm sorry.
I've been a shitty friend.
I miss my buddy.
You were right.
Adam Sandler is fucking hysterical.
Stan, are you all right?
Yeah, dude, I totally get it now.
I can see how lame I was, saying everything was- was shit.
Really?
Stan, that's great.
But, Kyle, It's all shit.
For reals!
Everything's shit 'cause of aliens with A.I.
And you and me are gonna fuck it all up.
Come on!
Dude, have you been drinking?
You're not listening to me, Kyle.
Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal.
It's too late for that.
Things just can't go back, Stan.
I'm with Cartman Burger now.
Dude, Cartman Burger?
Seriously?
How shitty is that fucking concept?
See, there you go again.
Look at you, dude.
Look at what you've become.
Everything all right here, Kyle?
Yeah, it's fine.
We're gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there.
Come on, Kyle, this is about you and me, remember?
Look, dude, things around here have changed.
Sometimes the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Fuck you, Kyle!
You're a piece of shit.
Kyle, I love you.
You're a piece of shit, though.
Fuck you!
I love you.
Big Harry and Mike in the morning, and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of... , we're breaking it down.
Oh, Big Harry, when the...
Ran into the... .
Oh, no, no, how about when......
He's back.
Did you see the illusionary world again?
How did it feel to be back in the matrix?
- I feel like total shit.
- It's okay.
That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
Try and focus, Stan.
We've found them.
We know where the rock creatures are now.
The rock creatures?
Or aliens or A.I. Things.
Whatever.
Fuck you.
Dude, I can't...
I can't do any-
He's gonna pop!
Come on, kid, wake up.
There's not a lot of time left.
You're pushing him too hard!
Oh, God.
Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion.
We're sending you back in.
We all know why we are here.
There is a rebellion in our midst, and it must be squashed out.
We have to put an end to Cartman Burgers.
- Yes!
What do we do?
- Yes, yes!
At KFC, we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
It's worse at Pizza Hut.
Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
What makes them so good?
For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings for all of our restaurants.
There lies the secret.
It's the chemical compounds of all our flavors-
Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC- all somehow infused into one burger.
It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of gas, and then somehow infusing that gas into his hamburger.
What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?
It would have to be some kind of super Dutch oven.
But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen.
Ah!
Ugh!
Yeah!
Hey!
Wake up!
Come on, wake up!
Use the smelling salts.
Enchirito?
You know the secret?
What?
You guys are aliens?
Stop playing with us!
What's the secret behind Cartman Burgers' amazing taste?
Dude, I don't know.
He's lying.
You see this kid in the picture?
This guy's his best friend.
Aha!
I'm not friends with him.
They've been through everything together.
Inseparable.
No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
Oh, right.
Like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that.
Dude, I didn't walk away!
I turned ten, and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-
Oh, sure, anyone would ditch out on their best friend because they weren't feeling good.
Now, stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers are so delicious!
I don't know.
All right.
I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way.
There's ten mediums and five medium-rares.
All right, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Next, please.
Oh, hey.
Kyle, you got to tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
What are you doing?
How do you guys make them so yummy?
I don't know.
You better get him to tell you, or you're getting shot in the back of the head.
You got that?
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Why, so that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?
No, because there's aliens with a sniper chicken on me.
Oh, God.
Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school, and I'm sorry, but your negativity is poison to me.
Oh, right, like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness.
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault.
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
Oh, yeah, right, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.
All right, look,
I honestly don't know the secret, dude.
Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
God damn it, this is getting us nowhere!
Everyone get back!
You want to play hardball?
That's fine.
All right.
Let's see this mighty machine once and for all.
You vampire sons of bitches!
All right, nice work, Stan.
Now comes the final step.
You have to take out duck president.
Just stop it!
You people are so full of shit!
Uh-oh, looks like the serum is wearing off.
Here, you better take some more.
No, I'm done with that!
But, Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation so that everything can go back to the way it was.
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!
I-I don't.
You were right, Kyle.
Sometimes the only way to go forward is to take a big left turn.
I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now.
I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude.
It's okay.
You're gonna do this, and I'm gonna do my thing, and... my mom and dad aren't getting back together.
But you know what?
It's okay.
In fact, it's better.
This change is gonna bring new things for all of us.
Where will Cartman Burger go from here?
That'll be cool to see.
And it opens me up to whole new adventures, exploring new relationships with all new people in town.
Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.
- Or maybe this kid will.
- Wow.
Maybe it won't be like before, but at least it'll all be new.
And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going.
For the first time in a long time,
I'm really excited.
Stan!
Stan!
Get in the car, Stan.
Your mom and I are moving back in together.
What?
We worked it out, pal.
Surprise!
No, Dad.
No, no, please.
We talked a lot, and we know it's what's best for you kids and...
I don't know.
No, Mom, sometimes you got to-left turn.
People get older, Stanley.
And as you get older, you realize the best thing to do is just stick with what you know.
* I took my love *
* I took it down *
* I climbed a mountain and I turned around *
* And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills *
* Till the landslide... *
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?
* And if you see my reflection *
* In the snow-covered hills *
* Well, the landslide will bring it down *
* Oh *
* The landslide will bring it down *
Oh, that's good.
I like that!
Big Harry and Mike in the morning talking about Two and a Half Men.
I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
Yeah, but what about that movie Dolphin Tale?
- I am psyched for that!
- Dolphin Tale!
Big Harry and Mike in the morning.
Let's hear one from the band Sledgejammer and their song-
Dude, we're gonna go see the new Zookeeper movie.
Zookeeper!
'Kay.
Coming.
Anyone watching thinking we know fuck all about knowing fuck all about owt, needs to watch their back...
So you've had your Labour, reclassifying skunk, sending prices sky-high, literally, literally taking the grass from its own roots!
And now you've got your condemnation,
Liberals noshing Tories like altar boys picking dimps up!
Have we had a national fucking stroke... or what?
Is revolution a word or was it never?
Anybody watching, needs to know, we cope better than average with irony in Chatsworth.
Well, for fuck's sake, we live in Manchester and they charge us for water!
I wandered lonely as a clown, necking mushrooms rarely found...
This green and pleasant land in ancient times...
Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!
It's not theirs any more.
This is our England now!
Paaaarty!
Contains strong language, scenes of a sexual nature and some violence.
The first throes of love are all about passion.
Eyes, hands, lips, limbs, kisses,
I love yous and promises of never-ending devotion.
Burning to memory every nook and cranny of that face, that body, drowning in each other, getting your fill, getting more than your fill, that thirst you can never really quench, no matter how much you try.
And fuck knows we try, don't we?
'I read in some mag, in a waiting room years back, that... 'if you put a coin in a jar every time you made love in the first 'three years of your relationship, then took one out every time
'you did it after three years... '
Yeah, yeah!
'..you'd never ever, ever, ever... '
Yeah, yeah!
'..be able to empty it.'
Cum again and soon.
Not too soon though, eh, Tiger?
Give me some time to recover.
Dickhead.
He's tipped you?
He thinks he made me cum.
Screams were almost convincing.
The yelps helped.
I had cramp.
Came in handy.
I can spot a fake a mile off.
Well, I guess you've pulled a few in your time.
Didn't need to.
My Brendan were gifted in the trouser department.
When he stripped off put me in mind of a tripod.
Any chance of you finishing early?
We've got a stag do in any minute now.
I'd leave the girls to it but we need all hands on deck for this one.
Lillian just took a call and the lads've been chewing Viagra since they left Burnley.
They won't walk in, they'll be pole vaulting.
No worries.
I'll catch you later then, OK?
He knows... that you're lying.
Orgasms aren't the only thing I'm good at faking.
He hasn't got a clue.
Don't know what's wrong with her lately.
I do.
It's too small.
It'll keep the wind off your back.
Yeah and give me twatting frostbite at the front.
I'll look like a fucking nutter.
But you are a fucking nutter.
Take no notice.
Beggars can't be choosers.
As soon as you get a few bob rolling in, it's me and you straight down to Primani for a proper makeover.
But until then, it's our Shane's cast-offs.
It suits you.
Yeah, it looks... nice.
It's pink and it smells of perfume.
Only real men can wear pink.
And it's aftershave that.
This is a bird's fluffy jumper.
Angora.
He's allergic to manmade.
It's got tit shapes in it.
Must've been me mam's.
You need to try it on.
You look lovely.
None of it fits!
Right?
I can't survive much longer on two pairs of socks, three T-shirts and a pair of undies.
Just one pair?
I wish I'd known that sooner.
I'm only on a tea break.
Laters.
Look, just go commando whilst they wash and dry.
Ready for action.
Homo!
Sorry.
I can't, I'll chafe.
It was only going go on a bottle of baby oil and some poppers.
You've been a pal to me, Micky.
And if I were queer, I'd bum you here and now.
Thanks, Marty.
You're going to make someone a lovely wife... partner one day.
But I've got to stand up on my own two feet.
I need cash, so I'll have to do a job.
Get a job.
Everybody get down!
Shut up.
Shut your...
This is a fuck up!
Shut the fuck up...
this is a stick up!
Rectal prolapse!
Gimme the money, gimme the money!
Evil...!
Fuck off!
Sit down, wait till you see this.
It's class!
Come on, you're in my seat.
Soon have you smiling again, girl!
Isn't that the shittest... crappest robber you have ever seen?
How much did he get away with?
Enough for some chips and a taxi home!
Fucking shame of it!
You know who that was?
You know.
I don't know.
So... why don't you tell me?
Marty.
How'd you know?
He was wearing my old coat.
Not his style, is it?
Armed robbery, not the coat.
I don't his fucking style.
It's only a matter of time before the filth get their shit together and clock it's him.
And?
Arrest him.
You're not arsed?
He's a punter, Shane.
Offering ten-grand reward for somebody to grass him up.
If he's daft enough to threaten people with a gun, he deserves grassing up.
It's deposit on a house that, you know, ten grand.
Maguires don't grass.
Fucking stupid though, weren't it?
He is fucking stupid.
Aren't you?
!
I said aren't you!
?
What the fuck was I supposed to do?
I'm here, skint, I can't work, I can't sign on.
What, in case the police catch you for non-payment of maintenance, you mean?
As opposed to armed fucking robbery, you gormless twat!
I needed money!
Then ask!
Don't go holding up Post Offices with fucking guns!
You could've killed someone, some poor bastard collecting their pension.
You could've got killed yourself and then what would I have done?
!
I mean, how would I have explained that to Sue?
Where'd you get the gun?
They're stashed here!
It's family stuff, you know the score, Kel!
You keep him away from guns, you got that?
Guns and fucking matches!
Sorry!
It could bring a load of trouble and...
We've had enough...
That... that gun, could be linked to Shane, maybe and they'll...
You're looking lovely.
You do, you look dead nice, like.
Nice.
Proper like... glowing, healthily.
I was thinking... do you want me to make tea tonight?
What's going on?
Why would anything be going on?
I was married longer than you've been alive.
And I know that when a man's buttering you up with a string of compliments, he's about to do one of two things - confess or request.
Which is it?
Er...
Don't lie!
If you've got something to say, say it.
I've just...
Speak!
Well, now it's out in the open, who Cilla's dad is,
I was thinking if like...
if we could... well, when she's Christened, if we could give her a second name?
You know, cos her mam gave her her first name, her dad can give her her second.
What were you thinking of?
Maureen.
Fuck off.
What, it's me mam's name.
She can keep it.
It's not fair, Mimi.
You get to do everything and I just get shit on by you, Shane, Jamie and Micky.
OK.
Always taking the piss out of...
out of me.
Did you just say OK then?
On one condition.
That you convert, come over to our side.
You mean support Liverpool?
I mean become a Catholic, you knobhead.
Right.
Yeah, yeah.
You've been named, Marty boy.
Armed robber at the Post Office.
Cuddly little Marty with his funny little ways.
Wouldn't harm a fly, eh?
F... f... fuck off.
Terrify a gang of pensioners half to death in a Post Office queue, yes, but wouldn't harm a fly.
Fuck off, Shane.
Come on, I'm fucking with you.
You know what, I've been doing a bit of research, mate.
All you have to do is type in 'Arson' and 'Fuengerola' and it's fucking amazing what pops up.
You know, it's funny you never mentioned that your wife and kids died in a house fire.
Anyone'd think you had something to hide, mate.
Save your breath, Marty, you're going to need it.
I just called the filth.
I've told them where you were.
Run.
Run!
I've got a few more cast-offs for Marty...
I was dr... dragged out of bed last night by an armed copper with his gun shoved half-way up my fucking nostril!
What, family stuff?
They were asking me where Marty was.
I said, "I don't know", and spent the next... nine hours helping the police with their enquiries.
Someone must've grassed.
That'd be me.
And since when did you develop a conscience?
When I found out Marty's wife and kids died in an arson attack.
Spate of fires across Fuengerola.
Culprit never found.
But you got a fucking nutter out there with a history of that sort of stuff and, well, one and one... is two.
He killed them?
Yep.
Seems that way.
I was thinking of a trip into town.
Get you some new gear, something to eat, eh?
That ten grand you got for grassing him up burning a hole in your pocket?
It were anonymous.
I'm booked solid all morning.
Who wants a fuck at this hour?
You...
Once upon a time.
The thing is, I don't know anything about God or religion, Father.
He's C of E. Is he allowed to change sides, Father?
We don't really think of it as sides, now, do we, Mimi?
It'll be a lot of hard work on your part, Billy.
You'll have to research the faith, attend classes.
He's not afraid of a bit of hard work.
It's for my daughter.
And for you, too.
Front of the queue at the Pearly Gates if you're a Catholic, eh, Father?
We'll keep it informal for the time being.
Yeah.
Look forward to getting to know you as well as the rest of the family.
Lovely seeing you, Father.
And you, Mimi.
Take care.
I will.
See ya.
Micky.
Father.
Bye now!
What's he doing here?
Has someone died?
Billy's going to be a Catholic.
What the fuck for?
It's shit!
Thou shall not do this, that and the other.
And the guilt.
Takes you about a week to get over spilling your seed.
Stay Proddy, man, much more fun.
I'm doing it for Cilla.
You're doing it to get in with me mam.
It's for my daughter, your sister.
She won't thank you.
If I was going to change, I'd go Muslim.
Food's better and all you've got to do is grow a beard.
You won't even pass the exams, you, anyway.
Why's that, then?
Cos you're a thick cunt.
Mam!
Mam!
You, living room, now!
It wasn't me!
Don't have me saying it twice!
No matter how hard I try, your lads are just going to keep throwing it back in my face.
Nothing I do'll ever be good enough for them.
It's a lot for them to take on, you being here.
Going to take time.
You can handle this.
You're a tough lad.
Made of sterner stuff than they know.
Aren't you?
Yeah.
Now, these spuds aren't going to peel themselves, are they?
Shane's here.
I told you.
Tell him I'm occupied.
I did but he said he'd wait.
Look, if you and him's got a problem, sort it!
Cos punters don't like looking at a face like a smacked arse.
They can get that at home.
Give me a minute.
Tell him I'm just tidying, then send him up.
The only time I see anything floral is weddings, funerals and when you're trying to keep me sweet after a fuck-up.
By way of an apology?
A fuck-up.
Yeah.
A monumental fuck-up.
You know, I've been that busy, my mind's been preoccupied with a million and one different things, and I...
I've neglected the one thing that I value most.
I said thing, I don't...
I mean you.
And I'm sorry.
I know you've been distracted as well.
Hang on a minute...
I don't blame you.
I forced you away.
It takes two to tango... badly.
We are good, us, y'know.
We used to be.
We still are.
Let's make a bit of time.
Get away from here.
I want to be your husband again.
I love you, Kelly Maguire.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yes.
Yeah?
Yes!
Yeah!
Let's go!
He's lovely, isn't he?
Wouldn't think that if you had to spend as long as me looking at him.
I meant Father Craig.
So did I.
Ever since Billy started his conversion classes, we can't get rid of him.
Well, he can convert me any time.
Oi!
I heard that.
What?
Personal Jesus
What's got you smiling?
Wouldn't you like to know!
The look of love, little twinkle in the eye I can detect?
Sorted your differences, then?
Never heard it called that before but... we talked.
Toilets.
Now!
Look, I'm tired, that's all this is.
I'm relieved your marriage is back on track.
I appreciate the concern... but we've never been close and I'm not the sister type.
I just wish I'd had someone to talk to when me and Jamie were fucking ourselves over.
We've had a rough few months.
Like I said, we've talked and we're OK.
Good, I'm glad.
Cos it'd be all too easy to get hung up on someone who might let you down, wouldn't it?
You know, someone who might offer a bit of excitement short-term...
But long-term?
You wouldn't back him if he was a horse at the National, would you?
No, I don't think I would.
Use the men's!
Sometimes we can get distracted.
Things can seem a bit mundane.
We think the grass is always greener but before long we've...
I lost everything.
This isn't a bollocking, Kel.
I just don't want you to make the same mistake I did.
Joe?
There's no bog roll.
Well, drip dry.
Without going into detail, that approach won't have much effect.
Fine.
You can talk to me, you know, when it comes to stuff like this.
You can trust me.
Jamie, usual, double and whatever those boring bastards are having.
With a cyanide-fucking-chaser for each of them.
You not enjoying it?
He's everywhere I turn.
Never shuts the fuck up!
God this, God that, God the other.
He's got a bleeding parable for everything.
Can't even wipe your arse without him turning it into some kind of a lesson.
Hello, Father Craig!
Hiya, Father.
Going already?
Service in the morning, Mimi.
Billy says you'll be there.
Not going to miss out, am I?
Stop this now.
Gone!
I-I just wanted to impress you.
Get rid of that boring bastard, then I'll be impressed.
She obviously wants something extreme.
Y'know, a declaration of your intentions.
Reckon?
Think big, Billy.
It's obviously the way to her heart.
If not her heart, might get you into her knickers.
What d'you think she'd really, really like?
What d'you reckon'd make her happy?
Her and the boys?
What's going on?
Well, I just want you to be happy, that's all.
So...
I did something that'd make you happy.
So you robbed my car?
Borrowed.
Then what the fuck did you give him?
Just a load of ale.
Bottle of whisky.
And?
Some pills I found in Micky's sock drawer.
The blue ones?
Orange?
Not the yellow ones.
One of them'd floor all the Happy Mondays!
How many d'you slip him?
Four.
Well no wonder he's dead!
They're meant for horses of a nervous disposition!
What in the name of God did you think you were doing?
You said you'd be impressed if I got rid of him!
I didn't mean kill him, you thick twat!
I meant out of my line of vision for a split second!
Out of my range of hearing, not bleeding dead!
So what we going to do?
Pray for forgiveness.
He's killed a Priest.
Well, let him fucking pray then.
It's nowt to do with us.
I'm going to hell.
And I'm not even Catholic!
And you think God's going to turn a blind eye to the fact that we're sitting round discussing how to get shot of the body!
?
Er, excuse me, I just came up with a solution that went down like a lead balloon.
The solution being that we take him to your mate's sausage factory?
!
You've never objected before.
I've never turned a priest into a sausage before!
We'll be excommunicated.
We're already excommunicated.
Call your mate.
Make the arrangements.
Hang on...
You're not actually going to go through with this?
Have you got a better solution?
Remarkable.
Just when I thought you'd never be able to shock me...
OK, if we're going ahead with this, you need to make yourself scarce.
No way!
He got us into this shit, he's going to help get us out!
They'll get a fair few sausages out of him, though, won't they?
He was a big lad, wasn't he?
Fucking arse!
Kelly!
What d'you want?
Played me for a fool, didn't you?
No.
Not that I blame you.
I am a fucking idiot... falling for you... your lies.
If you think I lied, why did you come?
To tell you to get out my life, to keep on running.
Fuck off so far away from me and never come back!
Sue left me.
She walked out and took the kids.
She wanted stuff I couldn't give her and...
She found someone who could.
And I begged her...
I begged her to come back, but she said, "To what?"
To what.
I was on my own.
And I was getting pissed most nights cos...
And I lost my job cos I couldn't get out of bed for the hangovers.
I ended up on the street.
And I was angry with myself, I was so angry.
I'd lost my wife, my kids...
My job, my flat.
So you set fire to them?
Took a while, but here he is at last, eh?
Will the real Marty Fisher please stand up.
Look...
The lying, murdering Marty Fisher.
No, no, I-I-I...
Save it.
I thought you were different.
Fucking cliche alert!
I hope they find you, Marty.
I hope the filth drag you in and I hope you go down for life.
Sue didn't deserve that.
And your kids...
K-K-Kelly...
Fuck off.
I love you!
And I love Shane.
Shit!
They're still looking for Marty.
Right, Father Craig's pissed after an all-night wake.
We're taking him back to church.
Everyone stay calm.
Can I ask where you're going, lads?
Just bringing a mate home.
Bit worse for wear.
Hope you sober up for Sunday, Father!
Me daughter's christening.
He's going to puke!
Do you want to get out, Father?
No!
He's just rat-arsed.
Don't tell the Pope
D'you want to open the boot for us, please?
Shh!
I can't...
Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, that's great, mate.
Cheers.
Your other mate looks bad, too.
He can't handle his booze.
Think it was the punch what finished him off!
That'll teach him.
Cheers, lads.
See you, Father!
Vodka.
Double.
And one for yourself, Mimi.
Fuck knows you could do with one.
What you having?
Bit early for me.
To the useless, lying, two-faced, manipulative, deceitful gang of total bastardry that is men!
Fuck knows I'll drink to that.
Unless it's our Shane you're talking about?
A punter.
Finally revealed his true colours.
Same again please, Mimi.
You're working in ten minutes.
The barbershop quartet's in.
You fuck 'em.
Turn the light off, they'd never know the difference.
Course they would!
This is the male of the species we're talking about, brains in cocks.
And there's not much room in there for a brain.
Fuck 'em yourself, or better still, tell 'em to go fuck themselves.
You've had two verbal warnings, Kelly.
Third written.
What - you're going to dismiss me?
Then I take you to a tribunal and...
No, that's right I can't!
On account of your business being illegal and you'd end up in nick for being a madam!
Madame!
All you need do sometimes, is take a step back to get a good perspective, isn't it?
Where's all this coming from?
From me being let down once too often.
That's where from.
Shane?
No, we're good.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Y'all right, kidda?
All right, mate?
Not bad, mate?
Yeah, good-good.
Nice one.
All right, boys.
All right, mate.
Right, we need to get him in here, yeah?
And then get him to the processing room.
There'll be a tea break in ten minutes.
It'll be empty.
I'll need a hand stripping him.
I'll do it.
You want to bring him over here, Mickey?
Oof!
Shit!
Mam... you need to be here, and quick.
You said you'd checked he was dead!
I did!
Well, you obviously didn't check properly!
It's a miracle.
I'm telling you, it's a miracle!
Go!
Leave the talking to me.
And I prayed and prayed to God to find a solution and he did.
You OK, Father?
I, er...
I don't know.
I'm sorry, Mimi, I'm not feeling 100%.
Must've nodded off.
Had the weirdest dream.
And the Lord said to me...
Next time you want to impress me, try a bunch of roses, a box of chocolates.
We were lucky this time, Billy.
Make sure there isn't a next time.
You said he was a problem.
Thought you wanted rid.
Why'd she go to you if she did?
Cos... cos I'm the father of her child.
That was a biological accident.
A happy one!
Yeah, but an accident none the less, Mum.
Get this straight, Billy.
If there's a problem in this family that needs solving, this family will solve it, you got that?
We don't need you.
Don't want you.
By the way, you've pissed yourself.
That hit the spot.
It was lovely, that.
Thought you'd like it.
Liked it?
I loved it.
You don't have to overdo it, Shane.
No, it was nice that!
It was chips, bacon and egg.
It was great!
I'll do washing up.
No.
Come on, I said...
I know, and I said I'll do it!
Sorry.
No, it's me.
No, I'm probably trying a bit...
Don't.
It's not you.
This.
It's not you.
It's me, Shane.
Just, em... it's just me.
That mean I can go watch the footy that I recorded?
I love you, Kelly Maguire.
Yeah, you said.
Thank you, Carmel.
Just thought we'd give you this, Father.
Our contribution to the new roof for the vestry.
That's very kind.
Thank you.
So, ten minutes, yeah?
For?
Nice one.
Making out he's forgot.
You!
Cilla's christening.
Two o'clock.
You did say two?
Course I didn't forget, how could I forget a thing like that.
And Billy is proper excited, yeah.
About getting christened, the same time as his daughter!
Very kind of you to fast-track him.
He's welling up.
You know, he's so proud.
I'm going myself.
I'll just prepare.
I'm sorry.
What the fuck's going on?
!
Baptism.
Cilla's.
And you're godparents.
Lovely.
When?
Now.
Nice one.
If I snuff it, soft arse'd get custody of Cilla.
That's not going to happen.
Look at him.
He's a lovely lad, but a few bricks short of a full hod, know what I mean?
Mimi, I don't actually believe in...
We've heard it all before, Kelly.
You don't believe in God, we know.
Half the congregation'll be in the same boat.
I just want you to nod when you're supposed to, light a candle, renounce the devil, then get back to the pub and get pissed with the rest of us.
Got that?
Come on, soft lad.
Did that just happen?
Who does she think she is?
Geez.
Come on, Kel, she's always like that.
Well, she can fuck off!
You know what?
You're always like that.
And you're always like that.
Sitting on the fucking fence.
What's it going to take for you to back me up, mummy's boy?
You knew what you were getting into when you took me on.
Hang on, wait for me!
Barbara Castle?
In her day.
Edwina Currie?
Posh Scouser.
A contradiction in terms.
See, I'd have slotted Thatcher one in her heyday.
From behind, obviously.
Show her who's boss.
"Ooh, not for turning?"
Well, you fucking will be after this, Maggie.
One up the mineshaft in memory of Scargill.
But Widdecombe?
Wouldn't really be an angle that would satisfy, would there?
It's not as if you could half close your eyes, so they're all fuzzy and convince yourself it's somebody else.
Fucking Churchill would be a more attractive proposition.
Miliband's got a pretty face.
I think your mistake was going for someone with such a low profile.
What do you mean?
A priest?
If you want to impress the Maguires, aim high.
Take out some gangster and you'd be quids in.
Telling you.
You want to reach puberty, keep your trap shut.
Bin.
Now.
If I'd wanted a gangster, I wouldn't have gotten rid of Paddy.
I like you because you're you, OK?
Just be you.
A toast!
To Cilla Maureen Tutton-Maguire.
Welcome to the family.
Welcome to the family!
And to Billy Tutton.
Welcome to the family.
Welcome to the family!
You're one of us, now.
She means Catholic, by the way.
Not one of them.
For fuck's sake!
What the fuck's done that?
Rats.
Big fucking rat!
Excuse I for queue jumping.
I've got a turtle's head.
They're all occupied and I'm next.
I'm touching cloth!
Gents!
I'm...
Sorry?
Going to do the decent thing?
Hand yourself in?
Admit you're a fucking scumbag for killing your wife and kids?
A pathological liar for making me believe we had some kind of future?
Wasn't supposed to happen this way.
Too right!
I wasn't supposed to fall for the nutter with fuck all to offer but a criminal record and an empty wallet.
I wanted the white charger and the shining armour and I get you!
Fucking you!
Lights will be back on any minute.
Great.
Making sure no-one's fallen over, broken their neck.
Home soon, eh?
You never asked.
That's what fucking hurt.
After what we'd said.
What you said you felt.
You never asked.
Never!
What did I never ask, eh?
You fucking lunatic!
I wanted to tell you, but I wanted you to know me first.
You wanted me to fall for you first!
I didn't do it.
If you need me to, I can prove it.
I didn't do it, Kel.
I couldn't...
But even you thought I could.
Even you.
I'll be at the bus stop.
Corner of Muirfield Avenue and Lytton Street - nine o'clock.
I want to start again.
New life... with someone I love.
Someone I never thought I'd have the luck to come across.
It's a lot to think about, I know, and I would've done it sooner if all this hadn't have happened, but...
I love you and I want you with me.
Well, maybe you'll get one if you're lucky.
One, two, three, go!
I've not seen you.
Fuck!
'I used to wonder how I'd know if it was love and not lust.
'How you could tell?
'Because in the past, I thought it was there and it wasn't.
'It was nice, don't get me wrong, 'but it wasn't what it should've been.
'It didn't feel like it should've felt.
'If just the thought of them doesn't warm you, 'if being with them at the end of the day isn't all you need, 'if you're not counting the hours until you see them again, 'if you don't keep their old messages on your phone,
'just so you can hear that voice, 'then, it's not love.'
I need every single one of you to start pulling in some serious money!
I've got me community service.
He's doing drama and plays and that.
I think there's been a mistake.
Been years since I did a burglary.
It was always a bit of a turn-on for me.
You're gay!
Don't say 'owt, will you?
We won't say a word either.
You never go bareback.
It wasn't business, it was Marty.
Going to have to do a bit more than kissing to make him sweet.
Mary's giving Joseph a blow job?
I kind of liked having you by me side.
We should make it more permanent.
You having a laugh?
Will you marry me?

You can have a wedding like this when you will marry in a showbiz..
You son of a bitch..
But it is all my fault....
I tried to make a primitive redneck more cultural...
And he is bullshitting about some Raft where police is afraid to step a foot...
Move from my way,you bustard
Disco ball,like I am on Ibiza...
Ok,that was only one suggestion
We can have a tent like everybody...
You already had one savage wedding..
You will not have it again..
Not with me
And put that hands down so I can smack you
Ok,do it..
Wait a moment.
You are just looking for excuses..
This is my first wedding....
And it will be as I want it...
Even if that means,we will take a loan
Did you understood me..
Mister..
Shut up,when I am talking..
Do I have to go with you...
And here is the ring,give it to one of them!
Biserka.
What are you looking at,you old bat..
Fuck off you to your house..
Can we discuss this later...
No we can't
Here is the ring...
And arrest him,I hope he will get life sentence...
Poor man...
Sugar my mate....
Mister Raskovic...
You have to go with us..
Can we send your kid to chase ustahas and balijas...
That was the times
Pumas,famous unit..
Come on,kid
Go home dad...
Come on son,do not make me to pull you by the ear...
Mate,your dad is Serb and patriot he hates faggots too
Right Mister Limun..
Ustashas were in past
And against faggots I still did not had a war...
Dad give me cigarettes...
Did you reconsider...
What will you with judo club,you do not even have a building permission for it...
I am having an investiture for you.
he wants to build a shopping mall..
You can earn a lot..
Thanks for this..
I did hear your dog was shot
That's not cool..
No it is not.
You think you are some big shot..
It is different times
Your woman earns more money for shaving pussies than you with your muscles..
It is your pension time...
So faggots.....
Why you do not fight with someone normal
So it is an honour for me,when I get you out of jail
What,little of honour dad?
How about weapon robbery, or blackmailing,or money laundering?
You done all of that..
Yes I did son but in Sweden..
I should left you in jail and go to my honey moon as a man...
Fuck it son..
When we do not see each other,so you do not know
But,Biserka is ok..
I do not give a shit...
Wait,
Here some money..
Son....
You know I would kill for you
I would do same for her...
Fuck you dad....
You welcome... son...
Especially without trumpets and that rural primitivism..
What is wrong with trumpets?
-Nothing...-
But,if you want something really special, something for remember..
something romantic...
Romantic is fine... or eccentric..
why not
Great,then I have a special offer for you
We would be first one?
Yes
But without an old woman blowing flute..
Yes,yes...
This is one...
very exotic location..
The closed wing of jail..
Imagine how big hit this would be..
In venom part?
Excuse me?
We called it venom part...
Do you know how we did call solitary cells?
Honey..
No I do not know
And do you know how we did call part for death sentences?
I do not know..
Misko...
Look at this..
Can we go to a ring selection..
Fine,but I do not want a cream colour..
That's a faggot colour...
I want white,white is for weddings
Like this,look...
It even got pearls,and you are Biserka (pearl)
-We gonna change that shitty colour!
-
Into some boring straight...
(faggot pussies on car)
We will call cops..
And they will do what,block whole street...
Biserka,look the colour of a car....
Doctor..
What's up Doctor..
He is that cry pussy doctor
This your client,threatened me with a gun..
What a gun?
Which gun?
The bereta,that little nice one..
Fine...
Sorry but I will have to ask you to leave...
Sorry boy,but I am the one who usually throw out people
Don't Misko...
Mister Mirko,he will be fine..
I think you heard my partner..
O,Doctor,business partner
No business,he is my boyfriend, get it,we are fags..
faggots,are you not ashamed that faggot plans your wedding...
You are insane,boy...
Do not mess my t-shirt..
You animal!
I am sorry...
I do not know what to do..
He is not a bad man..
Please just go...
I do not know how I will spend my life with someone who acts like this,fuck it....
My emigration papers for Canada came yesterday...
And when did you ask for a visa?
-A year ago-
Do not know exactly when,maybe after that time I was beat up on the street, or when they forbade my show in theatre..
What,now you are wondering why I did not tell you
Because you are not pathetic gay,who makes weddings instead theatre shows
Radmilo,I can't anymore...
I hate my own land..
Just because I can't,at least for a one day walk free and proud...
Fuck it,sorry..
But I can't anymore
I am tired...
Excuse me doctor,I thought you are working on a dog..
No,no I am done..
I want to clean...
Don't forget to remove your gloves..
Biserka!
Baby doll...
Yes..
No,it is not him,it is that other fag
No you can't talk to him miss...
No I will not allow that people like you hurt him again
And you should feel sorry..
I do not give a shit for your wedding..
Especially for his wedding...
What the hell you know about pride..
That fact,that we will be beaten up, that knows whole city
Fuck it,I do not get it, why he just do not get her back by force..
Biserka is emotional..
I mean how many times she went to her mum and you brought her back
-What the fuck are you, some bloody shrink- No,god forgive..
Hey Limun, we could press that fags...
Fag in a boot of a car,usually gives wanted result
The fag will make you a fabulous wedding,Biba will be happy..
We just need to press his girl a little bit..
We did not work with fags yet
They maybe like the hard way...
So what do you suggest...
A nice word maybe..
Enough of crap,fuck it all, we are going to vet clinic to press a fat fag..
I presume I am the fat fag...
-Mate,the fag...
Except if you do not call one of us a fag..
I want to talk to you,alone
Get out all of you....
Boss,don't
What,you are scared he will fuck me?
Get lost,out all of you
You will not?
I will not,if You will behave...
Come on, so you finally get it that you and your girl,will take a walk in a concrete shoes down the river..
Sit.
I am having a job suggestion...
I am listening...
Come on Limun, finish with him...
what if he infect him with aids?
To protect you sick bustards...
You will not get anywhere with aggression
I did manage for so long...
I did talk to Biserka..
I would do anything for Mirko...
same as you would for Biserka..
When there is a love in question, criminal and a fag are same..
Tell me what you have to tell,fag..
The dream of your fiancé,for a dream of my partner, I think that's fair...
The dream of my fiancé,for a dream of your..
what ever he is to you..
what ever he is to me..
Get lost,now...
Get,lost..
Wait,you went to see that animal?
!
Do you really love me so much...
What you promise to him?
A wedding..
You need to organise it...
Sometime after pride..
Fine..
He will get his wedding..
He will get genius wedding...
Wedding how I would make for 2 of us..
I am not sure he would be glad with that idea..
I was right,what means to pack the bags and run away,that's exactly what they want..
Next time,when you will leave me, please take only a hand bag...
This is so humane thing,which you do..
I am so proud of you...
Who would say,that my Misko will be on top of a non violence communication..
Do you see now,how it is nice to be civilised..
I see....
(some non important religious talking,which is said when they are blessing houses and so on)
Ok,ok,fine... thank you father my brother,mate..
we are having some important business to do...
Ok,let's analyse.. how many people we need..
to secure that manifestation
What is going on?
Boss can I talk openly?
If you have to
You know I would give my ass for you...
But to protect a fags...
They are judo fighters,but they got their own security firm..
But they are criminals..
Ex criminals Excuse me?
I smack you with naked one (joke) I mean they are retired
I hope they are in handicapped pension..
Ok,Djordje
You just go on..
I will not disturb you..
Thank you very much I bet that among them,there is the one who beat Djordje last time...
The fascist called us all criminals,until we killed them all..
Ok,granny,what that have to do with this?
It does!
This is the top of an irony!
Djordje,I do not understand what you want!
I do not want this!
In my 50th I told to whole world who and what I am..
Congratulations
Thank you,but I do not want to be killed coz of that!
I want that state protects me!
Everything else is humiliating..
One thing is to be a faggot, other one is to be a coward..
Anyway,you know where we live...
And I think no one should be mad that
majority of us does not want to cooperate with that.
No,I knew it!
Classical ambush
Amateur one..
We will come to your parade, you faggot pussies...
You idiots!
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who my husband is?
Kill the faggots
Joj,when we get back to power (communists)..
Fucking morons..
Everybody will be the same again..
I am taking you home
Fine..
I do not want that you have anything with this anymore..
Come here sister....
O my god,she is worse than him...
Definitely
If anyone founds out what we are doing..
Our asses are dead..
Who ever says word ass one more time..
he will get over it.
What kind of people you are?
!
It was not a problem for you when we had to protect that showbiz whores..
You are not doing good..
You were not ashamed when we had to beat students?
Now when we need to give our part in human rights and that crap,non violent communication..
Now you are acting like fags...
Limun,about that,am I fag or not balijas and ustashas can witness,the one who survived when they met us..
And your fags can protect who ever wants..
And who must..
What it is it?
Is it money?
You can have double pay per day.
Is that ok?
It would be fine boss,only if till the rest of my life my ass would not be touched..
I wish you luck..
Mister Limun,can we help somehow?
I do not call you,coz of debt...
You will return me when you will have..
It is one job...
Nice,legal...
What did you hear?
Give me my money back tomorrow or, I am fucking your fag mother,
What aids,are you insane?
!
Bigger chances to get it is when you beat them..
If you make your hands bloody..
If you do not beat them the chances are minimal..
What is shame?
1000 per person for 3 hours...
Just pour it...
-I would not stand if something happens to her- she is everything I got,after my parents left me.

Please call few of your guys to protect the house 24 hours..

Honey...
You do not have to feel like that..
Do you know how big our bed is...

I did hear a lot of nice things about you..
Limun,will you call that apes of your friends?

Excuse me,can I get more..
Never mind,this is too much...
I do not have anyone to call..
No one wants to deal with them..
So what!
You will find new people!
There is no person in a city who does not want to work for you..
Biserka,this is very specific job..
Kiza already made a deal with his mates to beat fags... and he need to go by that deal,and Plajuz told me if fags...
If you would love me,you would...
What I would?
Stand alone against them?
You want that?
I am going..
Do you have any idea,how hard it was to vote that someone like you defend our rights..
I am very touched by that problem...
of asslicking parliament..
Now I will explain to you,how I get the majority in my parliament..
Enough!
You already done enough of shit!
This nice people, are staying here,until you make your promise to protect them.
Now stop with drama and act as an adult and responsible man.

You will keep the guard in front of the house.
At least my ass is more secure..
What did you say?
Eat shit..
You need like this with men...

To him,this is like that flags of that stupid football clubs...
Except Misko bleed to his pants for that flags.

The murder is not strange to me...
Trust me.
Biserka,listen me very carefully.
Ey sorry,is this like U,for ustashas?
Ustahas,balijas,

You really think that?
I like you too..
And my Misko likes porn with 2 women...
My godfather Sime,was always suspicious to me..
He went to America..
And he had 4 kids...
I have 2...
But we were always advise to marry...
Not to drag attention..
What a nice advise..
Shut up Limun,leave man alone... 20 years I lied to her...

And when she died..

To myself and everyone else..
This movie is classic..
My Misko love that movie...
Really..
Misko,Ben Hur..

Deal that my mate with yourself...
Both of them are cool...
Misko,why don't you join us?
You should be more tidy dog..

Like you want to know that...
Parent love is miracle...
How many times I asked you to come live with me to work for me..
Fuck it,I do not have anything else..

Listen,I know you are organised to beat a fags I would too
In the past...

Not to go much into deep..

For your mates,to leave us alone on Sunday..
Fuck you dad..
Fuck you and their money..

Fuck you all,I work like a horse and you all just screw me over and over...
But you need to do a blow job to this new clients...
Leave my son alone...
Take that money...
We do not need anything from you.
I bought this gun to you..
You would put it lower when you were angry..
in the past...
I was young..
Tamara,you did like our wedding, the trumpets...
Wedding was great, but next 15 years,sucked..
Does it hurt?
A little..
It is nothing..
Family issue..
My son..
He will be there?
...
Tomorrow father and son will fight against each other coz of stupid thing...
No offence,I am looking on that like that..
Me too...
And beside all of that..
I am scared to death...
But why you do then,all of this..
I think you know already..
At the end,it seems you and me are very similar..
You guys are ok..
You are not at all...
No not that...
I mean you are normal like us...
When you are ready coz of someone or something to stand on a line that is the only thing which is count...
Then it does not matter what you are..
We will get beat..
Take a drink...
You are cured.....
See,now no one would get you...
Comandante..
Look out what are you doing..
I will bet on you..
Lajos is out coulege.
Retired police dog..
Now it works for honorary...
He is dangerous in an oral finish...
Like some women,which I respect..
Put 1000 on Lajos,and later remind them that dog fights are illegal..
Lets go somewhere,where is more private..
Come on,I see you become too sensitive..
Are you joking me!
No..
I never heard anything more funny...
After singers,whores,war profiteer Limun is protecting faggots..
Give me 100 cops on 2 hours so everything goes fine..
First of all,you need at least 400.
Croats had almost 1000..
What do you want?
Car centre?
It is yours..
And that your dogs do not touch my dog..
Anything else?
What?
I hear that your woman is like Lajos..
Dangerous in an oral finish..
Now we can fuck you..
You are now in a risk group..
Yes..
Thank you...
No you can't help...
When you could,you fucked up...
You know what,I feel sorry for you.
And for me,my soul hurts, I will find him..
You know me..
No one can't escape from me..
Bye..give my greetings..
Halo..
Did you ask around?
And..
Nothing...
Bye..
My mates,if Limun is missing I am out of here..
I will not act as a boss in Belgrade..
Come on guys...
I will wait outside..
O shut up...
Fuck it..
Let me know if you find out anything..
Take this,for remembering..
(something on Albanian)
I don't have anyone to call anymore..
I knew it,that this will not work out.
Limun would not escape..
Never.
You are right,faggot Radmilo...
He saved my family..
He could lost his head coz of that..
Man like that,never runs..
He is not a faggot like us..
Halo..
Yes
What is now?
Are we going..
They found him..
Coulege from ER...
He is there,he is not good..
Let's go..
Misko.
How are you?
Fine,Fine..
Like someone did fuck me..
But not guys like you..
You do not have that technique..
Don't make yourself tired..
You have 3 broken ribs..
Only 3...
Eeeee,cops are not what they used to be..
I want to say sorry in my name and the name of us all..
Stop bullshitting..
Tomorrow you will walk
Like proud faggot..
That's my promise..
It was enough..
Don't Misko..
I am going home,to sleep in my bed tonight with my wife.
And now,little bit of rock.
Yeah,my mate...
Come on people,you are faggots but you are people too..
Thank you god that I am not straight.
But they are cute...
Come on..
I will dance with Roko..
Come on,we are going too..
Did I fucked up too much?
No..
Does it hurt?
No
Why do you lie..
It hurts,but little.
Go and park a car somewhere..
It could get damage...
Misko,will it be dangerous..
No,
It will be like dance with 20 ballerinas..
See you at lunch..
I love you Misko..
Azim,take out things..
Limun,
Balija,ustasha,faggot Radmilo..
We made it..
Seems this criminal invest was good.
(in distant kill the faggot)
This what you made possible for me No one could ever do it for me
What?
To fuck Serbs mothers in the middle of Belgrade..
Remember and return..
Your dad is there...
Fuck the pride...
Faggot stays faggot..
Can I go true?
Go here,you are good Serbian faggot and patriot
We are going to be fucked my mate..
I had enough..
Stop,stop...
Wait people..
Please people before you decide to go look at this people this is not anymore about straight or gay,this is 2 Serbias,that Serbia over there,force you
every day to be something you are not, it force you to have 6 different acts
one for parents,one for friends,colleagues,street it force you to be something you are not
It makes you tired..
I know we will be beat up today probably like we never was but even that is better than a humiliation which we suffer all our fucking life..
Let's dance rednecks...
Move you morons...
Give me that...
Crazy woman..
If I survive this,we will have a wedding like you want it..
I will survive that too
Oh yes,I parked in 1st zone,so we need to hurry..
Now,remember everything I teach you..
But remember it good..
It is 7 of us...
As magnificent 7..
(next few minutes will not be translated there will be a lot of noise and curses)
Watch out dad...
Take this son..
You are good fighter for a kid..
And you for a redneck girl....
Let me see Misko..
It is nothing,I am fine..
Where are you...
What are you interfere now,you mother fucker.
Human rights are my profession, I study for that all my life..
My partner had a dream,he believed till the end... till the end..
He believed till the end,how it is possible to walk down the city with raise head as a free man,without a fear that he will be offended..
or humiliate,just because he is different..
At the end he proved that..
he went to street and no one did not humiliate him..
One year later
So you made it...
What a success..
Few hundreds of us is protected by 5000 policeman..
Fuck it,you are problematic...
And tomorrow they will beat us on streets.
You can always come to me,same as your friends,on a course....
When I prepare you,no one will not touch you...
I am here because of him..
same as you are here because of me
Because of you 2,things will never be same again..
What it is it,you become more gentle..
Don't bullshit..
5600 policeman were securing the first successful gay parade..
6000 hooligans and neo-Nazi did not manage to break a parade..
207 people were injured..
in 4 hour fights,the centre of town was demolished..
On Belgrade streets people still are beaten coz they are different..
God bless.
God bless.
THE PARADE
Sugar...
Sugar...
Please hold on, brother!
It's nothing, I've been shot heaps.
Where's the doctor?
Go to reception first.
Look...
If he doesn't survive, neither will you.
He's alive.
And so are you.
Congratulations.
Sugar's a good boy.
Strong... like his owner.
Doctor...
It's your lucky day.
My wife left some cash in the robe.
What, it's not enough?
- You're one horrible brutal man!
- I don't have more...
I just saved your dog's life.
Look at him, he's crying...
If I'd smacked you a few times, I'd get it.
But I haven't even touched you.
We co-operated so well.
Is it because I didn't go to reception?
Okay, okay, I'm going now.
30 June 2001.
First attempt at Pride in Serbia.
We hope these images belong in the past, at least here in our city.
But our friend here, a guest from the Montenegro LGBT Centre, unfortunately saw that homophobia, hatred and intolerance still rule in this region.
But we hope that 10 years after the shameful...
Are you ready to take responsibility for violence on the streets next weekend?
What are your views about the Orthodox Church statement against the Pride parade?
That same head of the church...
Hello, sick people...
Scram!
Grandma!
Please leave me alone!
Bloody faggots!
- Go defend human rights in Kosovo!
- Shut up, you fucking bitch!
Hey man, everything's okay.
Run, police!
Kill, slaughter, faggots don't exist!
No, I wasn't beaten up this time.
Someone just spat in my face.
A slimy one.
Yeah, I was lucky.
Sorry, but I don't think one parade can change anything.
That's my opinion.
Well, I'm sorry too.
But at least I don't stick my head in the sand.
I don't stick my head in the sand.
I just want to have a normal life.
This is why I love my patients.
They don't call me a faggot, an ass-licker...
Easy for you to say.
While I'm on the barricades, you...
I have to go... see you.
DEATH TO FAGGOTS
You should report this, son.
It's the third time in the last 2 months.
Kids...
It's just the regular maintenance.
Your late mother used to like navy blue and metallic grey colours.
It would look like a sports car.
But someone likes this colour.
Wolf, can you take this Mini?
Boss, give it to someone else.
I'm too busy.
I can go some other place.
Don't be silly, you'll always get a discount here.
Hey, Boss, when will the grandkids come?
Thanks for the discount, Dad.
Your son is really taking his time.
- Whose wedding is this?
- The Glembay wedding.
Somehow it looks old-fashioned.
Perhaps you've got something more current, you know?
Yes...
Awesome!
Excuse me, we don't...
- What did you study?
- Theatre directing.
- Hilarious.
- Yes.
Excuse me, your future husband, has he got any ideas?
If you were asking him... it would be... chaos.
- But he's not being asked, get it?
- I see.
See, Sugar, those were real movies.
Real mates, like me and you.
Wait, easy... easy.
Come on, the plane is flying, flying...
Hey...
What are you doing?
Look, an old fart playing the flute.
She's quite manly, that one.
What's this?
Sandwiches of some kind?
Live fish in a glass...
Who'd eat that?
So what will it cost, besides my mates taking the piss for the rest of my life.
If you ask me, your friends don't have to come at all.
We can take a loan.
A loan?
I was taking "loans" with an AK47 in the nineties, without hostages.
You're such a redneck.
Totally.
A real redneck.
And the old woman doesn't play a flute, it's a harp!
But why?
I don't think that's something you should be proud of.
The action group Tolerance has received mixed public response.
The stench has poisoned and polluted our ancient city of Belgrade.
Rest assured, this is a prelude to the destruction of our nation...
I've had my daily dose of Fascism, unlike you.
You're like those cute peasants in The Magnificent Seven.
You need protection.
I'll be your bodyguard on Sunday.
Feel that...
I'd still prefer police protection.
There'll be one of the Seven...
Who's your favourite?
Yul Brynner?
What happened to the car?
The engine sounded strange.
Excuse me, since when are you an engine expert?
Let's just sleep.
Don't.
Steve McQueen.
Fool.
Move it, Fatso.
You came to do judo?
Or do you need protection?
There's table tennis but no yoga.
Come in, Fatso.
We do need a punching bag.
Excuse me, I came to enquire about a beginners' course...
Well done, now you just need to learn how to ride a bike.
Doctor!
- Take over.
- Sure, Boss.
Doctor!
Boss...
Look at him run...
We found out who shot the dog.
Hello, loser.
Sir is only joking.
We're playing cowboys.
Please, don't.
Where will your soul end up?
Tell him to stop, you idiot.
Radojsa, stop it, you little fucker!
Sorry.
- Who paid you?
- Pardon?
- Are you screwing with me?
- I can't hear, the kids are shouting.
Radica!
She'll come now.
Radica!
Get the kids.
I'm trying to talk to this guy.
Forgive me.
I'll owe you big time if you shoot him now like a dog.
That's all I can tell you.
- Lemon, see who I'm living with?
- Who paid you?
Please, I won't see the dawn.
If I tell you, they'll kill me.
You can do jail.
I have to take care of my family.
And I didn't shoot you.
That's how you screwed yourself.
Oh, fuck...
Hey, what do you think?
Will he choose where to bite you, or will you?
Please don't, Lemon, mate...
He'll go for my neck, right?
If I know him, yes.
Here...
And fuck you both!
Let's go, Sugar.
An official request?
For that parade?
What do you call it?
- Pride.
- Yes, that.
I was the principal in a kids' correctional institution for years.
I know about institutional pederasty.
Kids there say it's not sex until they bang balls on balls.
- They deal with it.
- Deal?
But they're not proud of it.
- Unlike you...
- Let's just go, please.
You're free, and proud.
If we give rights to you faggots, lesbians and so on, everybody will ask for the same.
Excuse me, Chief Inspector, an urgent call.
I'm glad I've finally met some of you.
I would never say... never.
Maybe we should offer him some money.
I could put you in jail for that, Miss.
Or try to re-educate you.
You can't say we didn't try everything.
Good day.
You must be Bogdan, Radmilo's father.
Listen, I don't want to know who you are or how you influence my son.
He's always been a nice, normal guy.
All right.
Fine.
- Excuse me, these aren't our keys.
- They're his.
I've taken him to games since he was a little boy.
Sorry.
Goodbye.
- Hey...
- Suck a dick.
- Buzz off, you criminal.
- Sorry, Madam.
Come on, hurry up!
I'll catch you, I'll catch you!
Little motherfuckers!
Fuck me, I preferred working with criminals.
Okay, I'll get your toy!
Hey, mate, how many heads do we have?
During the war, at least we knew what we fucking fought for.
You still know.
You work for a pay cheque.
How was work?
Normal.
We abused some nice people for money.
Great.
My sunshine!
So where were we?
Listen, didn't we say we'd have a wedding to remember?
It will be remembered!
I didn't want to ruin the surprise, but I'll put the cards on the table.
Do you know that club which opened two months ago?
- The Raft?
- Yes.
It can fit 500 people.
The disco ball's so big that when it fell, it killed a man and badly injured two.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
Across the street there's a church, a modern one, with floor heating.
The priest owes me money so he'll sing 3 encores, my dear.
Biserka!
Would you prefer a bishop?
Shut up!
Meatball knows the Pope, but the Pope isn't Orthodox.
It's not fucking show business!
It's my fault.
I try to cultivate a redneck!
And he bullshits about some Raft where police are afraid to go!
Move, moron!
Popes and disco balls!
Just an option.
We could have a normal tent.
You've had one hick wedding.
You want another?
Not with me!
Go marry some fucking trash!
And stay away from me!
And put your hands down so I can smack you!
Okay.
Wait a moment.
- Pigs.
- You're just looking for excuses!
It's my first wedding.
And it will be how I want it, even if we need a loan!
- Mister...
- Shut up!
Do I have to go with you?
And here's the ring.
Give it to one of them!
Biserka...
What are you looking at, you old bat?
Fuck off to your house.
- Can we discuss this later?
- No, we can't.
Here's your ring without the receipt!
Arrest him!
I hope he gets a life sentence.
Poor man...
Come on...
Sniff, Sugar, sniff...
Fuck...
Mr Raskovic, you have to come with us.
Gladly.
Could we send your kid to chase Ustashas and Balijas?
Those were the good times.
The Pumas, the famous unit...
- Come on, kid.
- Go home, Dad.
Come on, son, don't make me clip your ear in front of your pals.
- Mate, your dad is Serb and patriotic.
- He hates faggots.
Right, Mr Lemon?
Ustashas were in the past.
There's no war on faggots.
Dad, give me a cigarette.
Did you reconsider?
What can you do with judo?
You don't even have a permit.
I've an investor who wants to build a mall.
You could earn a shitload.
Thanks for the favour.
I heard your dog was shot.
That's not cool.
No, it's not.
Think you're a big shot?
Times have changed.
Your gal earns more shaving pussies than you with your muscles.
It's time for you to retire.
Faggots?
Why not fight someone normal?
Then I'd be honoured to get you out of jail.
Not proud enough, Dad?
How about armed robbery, or racketeering?
- You did all that, right?
- I did, son, but in Sweden.
I should've left you in jail and gone on my honeymoon like a man.
Fuck, we hardly see each other, so you don't know...
But Biserka is okay, right?
I don't give a shit.
Wait.
Here's some money.
Son...
You know I'd die for you?
Well, you see, I'd die for her too.
Fuck you, Dad.
You're welcome... son.
There won't be the primitive attack of trumpets on your eardrums or an expression of that generally arrogant rural primitivism.
- What's wrong with trumpets?
- Nothing.
Nothing at all.
But if you want something really special and unforgettable...
- Something really romantic...
- Romantic is fine.
- Or unique...
- Why not?
Great, then I have something new no one has tried yet.
- So we'd be the first?
- Yes.
Cool, but without an old bag playing flute.
Yes, yes, no flute.
This is one very exotic location.
The secure wing of the central jail.
Imagine how hip a fine, elegant cocktail would be there?
- In the dining area.
- The toxin room?
- Excuse me?
- The toxin, or poison room.
You know what we called solitary?
Honey...
No idea.
- Or what we called death row?
- I don't know.
Misko...
- Look, Versace!
- Where?
Can we get to choosing the ring?
Just a second.
Fine, but no beige.
That's a gay colour!
I want white, white is for weddings.
Like this.
It even has pearls in it, like your name.
We'll change that crappy colour into something straight, like navy...
Fuck...
FAGGOT PUSSIES I'll call the cops.
- As if they'd do anything.
- Bisa, look at the colour.
Doctor...
What's up, Doctor?
He's that cry-pussy doctor.
This client of yours threatened me with a gun.
What gun?
- Which gun?
- A Beretta 9, that nice little one.
Fine...
Sorry, but I'll have to ask you to leave.
Excuse me, boy, I'm the one who throws people out.
Honey, don't.
- Mr Mirko, he won't...
- I'll deal with it.
- I think you heard my partner.
- Oh, Doctor...
- Business partner?
- There's no business.
He's my boyfriend, get it?
We're faggots!
Are you ashamed to have a fag plan your wedding?
You're insane, boy.
Don't mess my shirt!
You animal!
Sorry...
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to do.
He's not a bad man.
Please just go...
I don't know how...
I can spend my life with someone... someone who fucking acts like this.
I applied for emigration papers to Canada.
I got the reply yesterday.
- And when did you apply?
- A year ago.
I don't know exactly when, maybe after I was beaten up or when they banned my show at the theatre.
Are you wondering why I didn't tell you?
Because you aren't a pathetic middle-aged gay man who does weddings instead of theatre.
Radmilo, I can't bear it any more.
I hate my own country because I can't, even for one day, walk free and proud.
Fuck, I'm sorry.
But I can't do it any more.
I'm tired.
Excuse me, Doctor, I thought you were working on a dog.
- No, no, I'm done.
- I wanted to clean.
Don't forget to remove your gloves.
Biserka!
Baby doll...
Yes?
No, it's not him, it's that other fag.
No, you can't talk to him, Miss.
I won't allow people like you to hurt him again.
You should feel sorry.
I don't care about your wedding.
Especially his wedding.
What do you know about Pride?
The whole city knows we'll be beaten up.
You're no expert...
Why the fuck can't he force her to come back?
Biserka is... emotional.
She's run to her mum before and you've got her back one way or another.
- You're a fucking shrink now?
- No, God forbid.
Hey Lemon...
we could put pressure on those fags.
Sightseeing in a car boot usually produces a result.
He'll do a top wedding and Bisa will be happy.
We'll just press his "girlfriend" a bit.
We haven't worked with fags.
Maybe they like it hard.
What do you suggest?
Sweet words?
Enough crap.
Forget the girl.
We'll go to the vet's to press the fat faggot.
I presume I'm the fat faggot.
Look, a faggot.
Unless one of us is a faggot.
I want to talk to you alone.
- Get out.
- Boss, don't.
What, you're scared he'll fuck me?
Get lost, out!
- You won't?
- I won't, if you behave.
Come in.
So you see, you and your girlfriend could walk in concrete sandals down the river.
Sit.
- I have a business proposition.
- I'm listening.
- Come on, finish him.
- What if he gets AIDS?
- Protecting you sickos!
- Aggression is no good.
- It's worked before.
- I spoke to Biserka.
I'd do anything for Mirko, same as you would for Biserka.
When love is the issue, a criminal and a fag are the same.
Say what's on your mind, faggot.
Your fiancé's dream for my partner's dream.
I think that's fair.
My fiancé's dream for a dream of your...
- Whatever he is to you.
- Whatever he is to me.
Get lost, now.
Leave.
You went to see that animal?
You really love me so much?
What did you promise him?
A wedding.
You need to organise it.
Two weeks after Pride.
Fine.
He'll get his wedding.
He'll get a brilliant wedding, as if it was ours.
I'm not sure he'd be happy about that idea!
You were so right.
Pack our bags and run away, that's exactly what they want us to do.
Next time, when you leave me, please just take a handbag.
What you're doing is so humane, I'm really proud of you.
Who'd think my Misko would be so good with non-violent communication.
See how nice it is to be civilised?
I see.
Let the drops of holy water, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, bless this... gladiator... and drive away every other evil.
Amen, fine, thank you, Father.
We have important business.
God bless.
Okay, let's hear the job analysis.
How many people do we need to secure this solemn manifestation?
Manifestation...
What's going on?
- Boss, can I talk openly?
- If you have to.
You know I'd give my ass for you if I had to.
But protecting poofs, that's...
They're judo fighters, but they own a security firm.
- But they're criminals.
- Ex.
- Excuse me?
- Spare me...
I mean they've retired.
- Disability pension, I hope.
- Okay, George.
- Go on, I won't interrupt.
- Why thank you!
I bet it was one of those judo guys who viciously bashed George last time.
The fascists called us criminals too till we killed them all.
- Granny, it has nothing to do with us.
- It has!
This is the height of irony!
- What do you want?
- Not this!
In my 50s I told the whole world who and what I am.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
But I don't want to die.
It's humiliating unless the state protects me!
Being a fag is one thing, a coward is something else.
Anyway, you know where we live.
No one should be mad that the majority of us don't want to work with those...
No, I knew it!
It's a classic ambush!
And an amateurish one.
I'm going to burn you mothers now.
We'll be at your parade, poofters!
You idiots!
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who my husband is?
Kill the poofs!
When we commies get back into power... everybody will be equal.
- I'll take you home.
- Fine.
- I don't want you involved.
- Come here, sister.
- God, she's even worse than him.
- Definitely.
If anyone finds out what we're doing... our asses are gone.
Say the word "ass" one more time, you'll lose it.
What kind of people are you?
It wasn't a problem when we protected those showbiz whores.
No, get in with your hip, then throw him down.
You weren't ashamed when we beat up students for cash.
They didn't study.
Now, when we need to contribute to the advancement of human rights and all that crap... non-violent communication... now you're acting like pussies.
Lemon, about whether I'm a pussy or not, the Balijas and Ustashas can testify.
Well, those who survived after they met us.
Your poofters can protect whoever they want, and whoever needs it.
What is it?
Money?
- You'll get double pay, okay?
- It will be okay, Boss... if my ass isn't touched for the rest of my life.
I wish you luck.
Uncle Lemon, can we be of any help?
I'm not calling because of the debt.
You'll return it when you have it.
There's a small job.
Nice, legal.
What did you hear?
Pay my money tomorrow or I'll fuck your fag mother.
What AIDS?
Are you nuts?
You'd more likely get it from the blood on your hands when you bash them.
Not much chance if you don't bash them.
What's a shame?
1000 per person for 3 hours?
Yes.
Hey!
Just pour it, honey.
I couldn't stand anything happening to her.
She's all I've got after my parents left me.
Have some more.
- You suffered very bad things.
- What bad things?
Misko...
These poor people's lives are in danger.
Call a few of your guys to guard the house 24 hours.
I'll make their beds.
Lenka can sleep with me.
- I'm not comfortable with that.
- Honey, you don't have to worry.
Do you know how big our bed is?
Three men can get into it.
Oh, that's great, then.
Sugar!
- He recovered well.
- Come here!
Who's this dog?
This is our famous designer, George.
I've heard a lot of nice things about you.
Lemon, will you call those ape friends of yours?
Look how scared shitless they are.
Excuse me, another...
Never mind, this is too much.
I've no one to call.
No one wants to deal with them.
So?
There's no person in the city who won't work for you.
Biserka, this is a very specific job.
Kiza has already made a deal to beat up fags and must stick to that.
Plajuz told me if fags...
- If you loved me, you'd...
- What?
Stand alone on the line?
- I'm leaving.
- No.
Do you know how hard it was to vote for someone like you to defend our rights?
I'm touched by the problems of your ass-licking parliament.
Know how I get a majority in my parliament?
Enough!
You've already done enough shit!
These nice people will stay here till you keep your promise!
Now stop with the drama and act like a responsible adult.
A real criminal.
You'll keep watch in front of the house, go on.
- At least my ass will be safe.
- What did you say?
Eat shit.
That's how you deal with men.
- What are you doing?
- I've nothing to do with this.
I know this is your stuff.
It's far from ideal but look how it opens the space instead of those dusty ugly things.
My Misko went to war.
To him they're like stupid football flags.
Except Misko bled in his pants for those flags.
- Why?
- What?
- These are holy objects!
- Fuck me stupid...
- Okay, okay...
- Did you have to kill in the war?
I'm not a stranger to murder, trust me.
Biserka, listen carefully.
Hey sorry, is this like U for Ustashas?
Ustashas, Balijas...
Of course...
You speak like they're friends but you fought a war against them.
You can't understand.
Were you at war?
Of course not.
But you served in the fucking army.
Leave him alone.
See how nice he is?
Nice...
These nice people have only got one chance.
You, boy, give me that cap.
I can't promise anything, but...
I'll try to get a team from outside Belgrade.
Just a moment, you said yourself these individuals are criminals.
We need to be sure they don't pose a danger to us.
I'm a danger to you if you don't stop bullshitting!
- You needn't yell.
I can hear.
- Don't, he's a guest.
Someone has to go with you to assess.
- I think Radmilo is the best choice.
- No way!
Are you punishing me for something?
I don't want you to go.
Silence!
I'm the one who punishes here.
- No hands!
- Don't, they're guests.
He'll go.
And he'll tell you how this is real bread with 7 crusts, not the jobs you poofters do.
Since we'll have to drink on this trip... you have to learn how men drink.
Then we won't get screwed... to your pleasure and my extreme displeasure.
Can I get one?
- Later.
- Okay, fine.
- Come here.
- Nonsense.
No one can get that I'm gay if I don't want them to.
You think so?
So...
Two old mates meet after a long break and want to celebrate their meeting.
- Before going to bed.
- I heard that.
Take him upstairs before he starts to cry again.
Cheers.
Slug it in a manly way, energetically, not like a girl.
Not that finger!
They see that, they shoot the fag.
Hold it tightly, well.
- Hold it more...
- Casually.
Not casually, you are casual.
Hold it normally, like normal people, fuck it.
Go on, strong, firm, so the boom can be heard.
Boom.
- What did you say?
- Boom.
Cheers.
What did I tell you?
We're screwed.
Come on, get up.
Stand like a man, stomach in.
Pull your belly in, fuck it!
My car doesn't have roaming.
We need to take yours.
Give me the keys.
You like weapons too?
It's just decor...
That's a Magnum 357.
Good one.
What's that?
- What's this?
- Hydrating facial creme.
- For my tan.
- I know what that is.
Your luggage.
ADAM AND (ST)EVE
Bye, bye, you ape.
Pleasure or business?
- Pleasure.
- Business.
So a bit of both.
- Welcome to Croatia.
- Thank you.
Drive...
Drive!
So tell me, have you had it from birth?
You mean the "illness"?
Yes.
I mean, does it hurt when you... do that.
It hurts.
Why put up with that?
I'd fuck their mums!
- What the fuck?
- Little sheep!
Fuck the sheep.
Where are you going?
Hello, are you crazy?
Leave them.
Who's my little sheep?
What an idiot!
POOFTER CUNTS
Hey, maestro!
Please, stop!
"Little sheep..." He's carrying sheep!
I'll stick this...
No, that would make you happy.
You're sleeping in the car.
Come on, idiot.
We've a basketball team here so there's only one room left.
But the bed is "king size", as we call it in Australia.
If I catch you perving, I'll kill you.
It's the most primitive stereotype straight people have about gays.
I told you once.
Just be careful.
You won't be checking out my ass.
That's it.
I'd do much worse things for you.
Yes... he's just my type.
Poofter!
Come on, Buljan, shoot!
Any cute ones?
You're a gargantuan living example of an alpha male.
If that's something bad, you're screwed.
Do you have any interests, like animals or books?
Music?
- Do you watch movies?
- Only the old ones are worth it.
Old, like Van Damme's stuff?
No.
Old, like Ben Hur.
Well, Ben Hur is a totally gay movie.
- What did you say?
- Ben Hur and Messala are lovers.
When they meet after 15 years, their passion is so strong it's incredible.
You know what?
You're a really sick boy.
Sweet granny...
Like sugar.
- Should I wait in the car?
- No.
- Which one is ours?
- Scarf.
Waiter.
- What will you have?
- Two beers.
Local dialect, how diplomatic.
Bring any, as long as it's Serbian.
- Please, let's go.
- Why?
I'm thirsty, I'll have a beer.
I fuck your Sunday, fucking Chetnik pig.
Where have you been, Ustasha pussy?
Look at you...
You're great.
What is this?
You're a bit fuller.
You play?
Ben Hur...
Come on!
Let's drink the first round for 1991!
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
The second one for 1992.
I know you from somewhere.
- West Slavonia?
- This is my brother.
Zuko.
He's a sniper.
He remembers the ones he missed.
How will I find them later if I don't have a good memory?
How did you two meet?
It was summer 1992...
- 1993.
- No, it was 1992.
And we were shooting.
But shooting like men should.
We shoot and shoot.
Bullets fly everywhere.
Like in hell.
None of us moves forward.
Not one step.
It's a stalemate.
And then I saw him.
I had some kind of diarrhoea.
Fuck it, they shit everywhere, those Chetnik shit scum.
For three days it leaked out of me.
Cheers!
Take that glass.
Jumping like a bunny.
He was so cute that I felt sorry to shoot him.
U-yo, U-yo!
Be a man, Chetnik dickhead, and let me finish shitting then I'll improve your statistics.
Deal, but come out front where I can see you.
- Is it Candy?
- Candy.
U-yo!
People, I've never seen such joy on a man's face.
- The man loved his ass.
- So the point of this story is...
Don't.
Roko, I came here because of ass, in a way.
Can we talk alone?
- It's a job.
- Bank problems?
Where were you during the war?
I was at school then.
There will be other opportunities.
Cheers!
- I'll fuck your Chetnik mother!
- I'll fuck your Ustasha mother!
Come on, poofter!
Come on!
Roko!
Zlatica's in labour.
And you're screwing here with Serbs?
Fuck, Dad, call a vet!
- It's too late.
- Holy mother!
- Her mouth's foaming.
- Oh, dear.
Breech position, where is she?
A Serb can help me, but I got you two fags.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
You fucking bastards!
- Here you go, Doctor.
- I need a helper.
- I can't stand blood.
- Zlatica is like a child to me.
Shame on you.
Don't just stand there.
Come here.
- What should I do?
- Tie up the legs.
- Pet her.
- Do what?
Her hind legs are stuck.
Don't faint.
Cut the crap.
- It's okay.
- Here we are.
I'm going to make a profile for him on Facebook.
Congratulations, it's a boy.
Last time we took a title was 2005 when Zlatica was born.
And now he'll fuck up the Zagreb Purgers again.
- A son, congratulations.
- Thanks.
So you're that... poofter.
I'm Radmilo.
I owe you one, Radmilo.
The kid is good.
But I was suspicious.
The way he drinks.
See?
What did I tell you?
If you hadn't been with him, we'd have bashed him at once.
Naturally.
I killed people, and Serbs...
I did robberies in Germany and Sweden.
In wartime I made deals with everyone, but I never protected fags before.
It's good to try everything in life.
It will be great for your CV!
And Edo, the Slovenian?
The Montenegrins killed him in fucking...
Stockholm.
- Hudo Djukanovic?
- I was at his funeral last summer.
- And what about Nettle?
- The Hague... 20 years.
Poor guy.
What are you looking at?
- The Macedonian, Anastasov?
- He went into politics.
Phew, fucking asshole.
- What about the Bosnian, Zubovich?
- The Balija?
He's alive and free.
WELCOME TO BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA March into the woods, Chetniks
Straight, that way.
- No rifle!
- Shut up or you die like a dog!
I asked for normal movies...
Hunter Protects Sarajevo,
Blondes On a Business Trip, Shove It Like a Man 3...
Check it out.
The kid mixed up the discs.
What does he know, he's only 7?
- I'd never do it, I swear by Allah.
- Watch it!
Watch it!
Don't close your eyes.
Watch it.
Watch it!
Anal Pals, Rectal Wars, Milk Your Daddy...
The City Cocks, The Bridge Over...
Fuck you, man!
- Do you hear?
- I won't watch that.
Watch it, or I fuck your fag-loving ass.
You're watching it, pussy?
- People, do you have a remote?
- Fuck off...
- Lemon!
- Ibro!
- Hi, Chetnik...
You, don't move!
- What's this?
Ever heard of non-violent communication?
- What's that?
- What?
That's when I let you be so my people didn't shoot you.
- Would be better if they had.
- Here's the Ustasha!
- Where have you been?
- The complete team.
Look, a Chetnik, an Ustasha, all that's missing is a faggot.
Present!
You motherfucker...
Fucking bastard!
CHETNIK PUSSIES
At least now that faggot graffiti is covered.
"No one can do anything to us, we're stronger than destiny.
"They can only hate us..."
Fucking American asses!
You fucked up the Indians and Vietnamese, but not us.
No!
You faggot fuck!
"No one can do anything to us, we're stronger than destiny.
"They can only hate us.
All those who don't like us..."
What a nice soprano.
"Pines and firs, maples and...
"And birches, one bending to the other..."
What the fuck are they staring at?
That one's recording.
- Azem...
- Waiting for NATO again?
Lemon, you Serbian pig!
How are you, you Shiptar pussy?
Hey, no kissing.
- Come on, 3 times.
- For luck.
Is there anyone Lemon didn't fight?
What we are looking at?
My flying soul...
Look.
Nice, nice.
A real Serbian hawk.
Fuck...
look at it.
Not completely Serbian, he's got a little bit of Albanian.
A Serbian one lands empty-handed, I mean legged.
This one brings presents.
Fuck your Albanian mother...
Heroin.
It cures AIDS, that's how strong it is.
He's tank-phobic.
Give me the goods.
These are my regular customers.
Free Kosovo!
Hey, democracy, brotherhood!
Thank you!
Cash machine.
See how well we live off donations?
The whole village.
Here, my share.
- You should be up for a Nobel Prize.
- For peace.
This is a real criminal, not us.
This is Shefket.
He only carries heroin.
Dad's beauty.
This one here specialises in white stuff.
This is an owl, she's the third night shift.
And this one here...
Ibro.
He doesn't do much.
Tastes the goods.
Got addicted to heroin.
Come on, son.
See?
A fucking tragedy.
Got a canary for Ecstasy?
- Animal abuse!
- Shut up.
- What did he say?
- Nothing, he's tired from travelling.
Azem, I've got a nice job for you.
- Something to do with hawks?
- Not hawks...
I'll explain.
Tell me, Azem, do you know what a sexual minority is?
I do.
It's you Serbs...
At least that Balija stuff is covered.
And this is like a hawk... in a crest it's like the Serbian coat-of-arms.
I had such a nice time in Belgrade.
Me too.
It was so exotic, man.
Just avoid the zoo.
You'll get arrested again.
What do you mean?
20 years ago at that zoo a zebra got clap.
They investigated and found cheap cigarette butts near the zebra.
Not cheap, Filter Yugoslavia.
They figured out that the workers who were fixing the wall...
What a cretin!
- And how was it?
- To be honest, nice...
- How could you do that?
- I was a kid, 22, 23, knew nothing.
Oh, fuck your mother...
- Was it at least a female zebra?
- Of course it was, he's not a faggot.
To be honest, I don't bloody remember.
In Bosnia, we keep garden gnomes in front of the house.
Biserka!
Honey!
Misko!
They're alive!
You're back!
Fuck, I thought they were stuffed.
Bisa, my brother.
- Oh God, they'll kiss now.
- They won't.
You're back!
Feel free to greet, but no touchy-feely.
- What, are you jealous?
- No, but I will be.
This is Halil, Azem, Roko.
And these are our fag... clients.
- My God, what rednecks!
- What?
I'm George.
Can I touch your muscles?
Touch it, if you like.
He'll end up like that zebra.
I don't get it...
Radmilo?
Excuse me...
This was a birthday present!
Mirko, wait!
- What did you fuck up now?
- Nothing, faggot issues.
Mirko.
Open the door, please.
Leave me alone.
This is the design.
Do you like it?
- Oh, fuck it...
- "Fuck it", Misko?
Oh, you really are a boss, mate.
You already live in heaven.
- Nice.
- You got a house from a magazine.
- It's a bit faggy... but nice.
- A bit...
Out of my way!
Tell me what happened between you two.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Wait...
I mean, you cheated on me with that?
Mr Mirko, my Misko is not a faggot.
What's that "uh-huh" supposed to mean?
Fuck off!
All of you!
I'll do this job as a professional and get married as a man.
- Move it.
- Misko!
Misko, wait!
Now Lemon will cry in the toilet.
We start from Point X.
They'll walk a couple of hundred metres to the horse statue.
Behind the horse, there's a big building where they keep old stuff.
- The flea market?
- Fuck it.
- The National Museum.
- Could be.
They'll stop there, wave that colourful crap, blow balloons.
Done.
Too much wine.
Half an hour of work and that's it.
- Where's the rest of the team?
- I'm working on that.
- An obvious provocation...
- They're talking about us.
- What shit did you get us into?
- Turn it up.
... calling for lynching, with graffiti saying "We're waiting for you".
He repeated in front of our camera what the neo-fascist group plans to do on September 20th.
For each fag, we'll send out seven Serbian patriots.
We'll see who ends up hurt.
We will.
There's no one else.
- How many "Serbos" will come?
- A few hundred.
Oh, my Lemon...
Of all places, I'll leave my bones in Belgrade.
No, you'll leave them in that shit-hole of yours.
Come on, see how big a man you are.
There'll be at least as many faggots as those regular dickheads.
At least seven times more straights will come to stop them.
They're just crazy kids.
Don't be afraid, Miss Lenka.
I'm here.
When you see the flags of St George, you'll know it's your end.
Phew, fuck your bearded father!
Don't worry, it'll be a fair fight, like Lemon and I had once, one-on-one.
- What did you train in?
- Rhythmic gymnastics.
As a boy.
Mirko, the deal wasn't that we take part in violence.
We don't fight.
That's why we hired you.
You don't fight, but you scratch, pull, cry and throw tantrums.
Now we're going to change that.
Tomorrow we're getting up at 6.
So go to bed.
In a one-on-one fight, initiative is most important.
I'll show you a grip called Hizagatame which made a lot of Ustashas really suffer.
And I'll demonstrate how we won the war by learning the techniques of immortals like Bruce Lee,
Mate Parlov and Cro Cop...
- Is this judo?
- They're hugging like aunties.
- Because of this Ustasha...
- 10 euros on Lemon!
- I won't bet on him.
- I will.
I'm betting on you.
Get him, Misko!
Get him now!
Judo, eh?
You fucking Serbian son of a bitch.
Come on, Misko.
I'm telling you, honey, a dick is an overvalued commodity.
Now, girls, let's see how you go.
I heard what you said.
Pay up.
Split into pairs.
Where are Lolek and Bolek?
Get out.
- We'll split into pairs.
- I'd like to go with...
You decide.
Want me to take Azem?
- Are you fags?
- No.
- I said one straight with one fag.
- Gay.
- Okay, one gay and one what?
- Straight.
Whatever.
You're so jealous of your partner, you'll poke his eyes out.
So you'll go with this nice guy.
What's your name, Lenka?
I can't go with her.
I'm terrified of lesbians.
Come here.
I'll go with this designer.
Stand there, hold your fists up.
Radmilo, Azem can teach you a few tricks.
Come on, defend yourself.
Wait, who's with me?
Why are you hitting me, girl?
Fuck, she's hitting like a man.
Lemon, where's my faggot?
Arms up like this.
Be scary, be scary.
Mouth half open.
You must look at your opponent.
Directly here.
What's wrong?
What, what?
Mirko!
- Are you mad?
- Horrific...
He scratched my face!
Lemon, are we going to fight or cuddle?
Some fighters...
It's obvious they're Serbs.
Look what you've done!
Don't be afraid, George.
You made them cry!
Look, Lemon, I'm a top professional but this is fucking amateurism.
Mate, you know I don't mind getting beat up, but us 4 against 400...
Lemon, these nice people don't have any bedding.
You're going to buy linen right now.
And since you're such a savage, Mirko and Radmilo are going with you.
Make sure you buy something nice.
- You like it?
- Yes, I like it very much.
Very nice.
I'd put babies into this.
Where can I buy a lot of it?
Well done, great taste, fuck.
Well done, Misko.
And easy with that drink.
Better keep it for your funeral in 2 days.
- I can't believe you're straight.
- You really think that?
I like you too.
Misko likes porn with two girls...
Terrific.
My godfather Simeon, who went to America, always seemed suspicious.
- And he had four kids, four.
- I have two.
We're advised to marry so we don't attract attention.
- That's good advice.
- Shut up, leave the man alone.
For 20 years I'd been lying to her, every day.
And when she died... then I confessed.
To myself and everyone else.
- This movie is a classic.
- My Misko loves this movie.
Really?
Misko, Ben Hur.
Ben Hur?
Sorry.
Here's your Ben Hur.
Charlton Heston is unbelievably handsome.
Steven Boyd is like a balm.
Who do you like more?
Ben Hur or Messala?
Decide that yourself, mate.
Both.
There aren't such suave guys these days.
That's love.
Misko, why don't you watch the movie with us?
You should be a more tidy dog.
I know it's for the wedding.
But I have to.
It's tough.
I'll return it.
Good evening, Uncle Lemon.
- Come for a beer.
- You're visiting our territory.
What do you want?
You can send the wedding invitation by mail.
How's work?
As if you want to know how to weld an exhaust pipe.
Parental love is a miracle.
How many times have I asked you to work for me?
To move in with me.
- Fuck it, I've nothing else.
- What else...
Put 100 euros on the table while I'm not watching and go.
Easier for you, easier for me.
Listen...
I know you've got a team to beat up fags.
I would've done the same...
in the past.
I understand that.
But I mean, who gives a shit, let them live.
To be brief...
I had to take this job.
I'm protecting the parade.
You'll protect the faggots?
Those sickos?
I've protected politicians, singers and all kinds of bastards.
For your mates, to leave us alone on Sunday.
Fuck you, Dad.
Fuck you and their money.
Listen, son, you and your mother never ask where the money comes from.
I work like a fucking horse and you all screw me.
I guess it's a blow job with these new clients.
Leave my son alone.
Take that money.
We don't need anything from you.
I bought that gun for your birthday.
You used to aim it lower when you were angry.
I was a kid.
Tamara, did you like our wedding?
The trumpets, the fun and all that.
It was okay, right?
I'm just asking.
The wedding was great, but the next 15 years... really sucked.
- Does it hurt?
- A little.
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.
Just a minor family argument.
- My son...
- He'll be there?
Tomorrow, father and son will fight each other over mere stupidity.
No offence, that's how I see it.
Me too.
I'm also scared to death.
So why do all this?
I think you know already.
In the end, it seems you and me are very similar.
You guys are okay.
You're not at all...
Infectious, eh?
No, not that...
I mean you're normal like us.
When you're ready to join a line to support something or someone, that's the only thing that counts.
- It doesn't matter if you're gay or...
- We'll get beaten up.
Have some whiskey.
You're cured.
See, now no one will identify you.
Come on, get him!
Commandant, be careful.
I'm betting on you.
Lajos is our colleague.
A retired police dog.
Now he works for money.
He's dangerous in an oral confrontation.
Like some women, who I respect.
Put 1000 on Lajos and remind them dog fights are illegal.
Let's get out of here.
Come on...
I hear you've grown quite sensitive.
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No.
I swear I've never heard anything funnier in my life.
After singers and war profiteers our Serbian hero, Lemon, is protecting faggots.
Please, excuse me... 100 cops for 2 hours so everything goes okay.
First of all, you need at least 400.
The Croats had almost 1000.
What do you want?
The car business?
It's yours.
And I want your dogs not to touch my dog.
- Anything else?
- What?
I hear your woman is like Lajos.
Dangerous in an oral contest.
We can really fuck you now.
You're in a high-risk group.
Okay, thank you.
You can't help.
When you could have, you fucked up.
Know what?
I feel sorry for you.
And for me.
My soul hurts.
I'll find him.
You know me.
No one can escape from me.
Bye.
Greetings to your folks.
Hello, Polenta.
You asked around... and?
Nothing.
Bye.
Mate, if Lemon is missing, I won't blow hard in Belgrade.
You guys, come on, time to go.
- I'll be waiting outside.
- Oh, shut up.
Fuck it.
Let me know if you find out anything.
Take this, to remember us.
- I've no one else to call.
- I knew this wouldn't work.
- Lemon wouldn't run away.
Never.
- You're right, fag Radmilo.
He saved my family in the war.
He could've lost his head for that.
A man like that never runs.
He's not a faggot like us.
Hello?
Yes?
What is it now?
Are we going?
Good.
They found him...
my colleagues in E.R.
He's there, he's not good.
Let's go.
- You have to go to reception first.
- Get lost.
Misko...
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.
Like someone fucked me a little.
But not guys like you.
You don't use the same technique.
Don't exert yourself.
You have three broken ribs.
Only three?
Even cops aren't what they used to be.
Hey, I want to say for myself and Radmilo, in fact, for all of us, fuck it, we apologise.
Cut the crap.
Tomorrow you'll walk like a proud man.
Like a proud faggot.
- What will he do?
- That's my promise.
- Enough of babysitting.
- Don't!
Those faggots won't do it,
I mean the straight and gay ones... the gay ones are double faggots.
But there's one condition.
I'll sleep in my own bed tonight with my own wife.
And now, a little bit of rock.
"Swear to me, my lucky superstar,
"that no one can..."
Yeah, mate...
"... break us apart."
Come on, even if you're faggots you're people too, cheers!
"No one can do anything to us, we're stronger than destiny..."
Thank God I'm not straight.
But they're still cute, in a way.
Come for Pride.
Later we'll play our own stuff and we'll really dance.
I'll dance with Roko.
Come on, we're going too.
- Did I fuck up too much?
- No.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
Why do you lie?
It hurts, but just a bit.
Go and park the car somewhere.
It could get damaged.
- Misko, will it be dangerous?
- No.
So much fuss about these 20 ballerinas.
Here.
See you at lunch.
I love you, Misko.
I love you too.
Azim, take out the equipment.
Lemon, Muslim, Ustasha, faggot Radmilo...
We made it.
Seems this criminal investment paid off.
Kill the fags, kill the fags!
Kill, kill the faggots!
Only you could have made this possible for me.
What?
To fuck up Serbs in the middle of Belgrade.
Remember and re-live.
Your dad is there.
I'll kill you, you disgusting bastards.
Fuck Pride.
Move it.
Faggots stay faggots.
God bless you, heroes, can I leave?
Here, sister, you're a loyal Serbian faggot and patriot.
We'll be fucked.
I've had enough.
Stop, stop...
Wait, people.
Please, before you decide to go look at these people.
Madman!
This is no longer a straight or gay issue.
There are two Serbias.
That Serbia forces you every day to be something you're not.
It forces you to have six different acts, one each for parents, friends, colleagues, the street...
It forces you to be something you're not.
It drains your energy.
I know we'll be beaten up today like we never have been but that's better than the humiliation we suffer all our fucking lives.
Come on now, you fools.
Make way, you screaming morons.
Do you ever shower?
Give me that.
Crazy woman...
If I survive this, we'll have the wedding you want.
And I'll survive that too.
Oh, and I parked in Zone 1, so hurry up.
Now remember everything I taught you.
And remember it well.
- Exactly seven of us.
- Like in The Magnificent Seven.
You bald moron.
Are you sure?
Move it!
Not on the face, you moron.
Go away, boy!
- Watch out, Dad.
- Take this, son.
What the fuck are you doing?
Come here.
No way!
You like faggots, Ustasha?
You won't get the flag!
Mirko!
Cops!
Run, run!
Woman, cops!
Fuck...
- You fight well for a kid.
- And you for a redneck.
- Let me see...
- It's from yesterday.
- Where are you, mate?
- Why interfere now, motherfucker?
Human rights are my area.
I studied that.
My partner had a dream.
He believed till the end...
He believed till the end...
He believed till the end that one should walk through the city with head held up as a free man
without fear of being abused and humiliated just because he was different.
And in the end he proved it.
He went out into the street and no one humiliated him.
one year later
So you made it.
What a triumph.
A few hundred of us protected by 5000 police.
Fuck it, you're a problem.
And tomorrow they'll bash us in the streets.
You can always come to me and learn judo.
And your colleagues.
When I train you, you won't need cops.
Great.
I'm here because of him.
Same as you're here because of me.
Because of you two, things will never be the same.
- Let me show you how to fuck, faggot.
- Shut up, cunt!
- What, you've grown more gentle?
- Cut the crap.
5600 police guarded the first "successful" gay parade.
6000 hooligans and neo-Nazis didn't manage to reach the participants.
207 people were injured.
In the 4-hour-long conflict, the city centre was trashed.
On the streets of Belgrade people are still beaten up just for being different.
"Amidst rifles and bayonets,
"Guards are all around us.
"Our troops are moving quietly..."

- Don't you just love Christmas?
- The only thing I love about Christmas is the fact that we're about to make a third of our yearly sales in 6 weeks.
- Every year around the holidays, you put on this Grinch routine.
But deep down, I know you are just a big softie who loves Santa and babies and rainbows.
Admit it.
- You watch too many Christmas movies.
Are those the QED reports?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Hmm...
It's not straight.
- Oh, I thought it reminded me of my ex-boyfriend.
- Hey, Jen!
What do you think?
Does it look good on me?
- You better hurry up.
We open in 5 minutes.
- Oh, I am loving the whole illusion today.
Who put that together for you?
- Hmm, you guys did.
- Aw, she's even wearing those cute little black heels we picked out for her at the 75%-off sale.
- You have 5 minutes.
- Fierce.
- Today, the official countdown begins.
35 % of our annual retail profits are gonna be earned over the next 6 weeks.
Now, is my team prepared?
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm?
Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm, yes, sir.
- Yeah?
Well, so is the competition.
Last year, our holiday sales showed a 12% decline, yet Internet sales rose 35%.
So how can Hillridge Malls compete in this overcrowded market?
- Incentivize customers to come to us, sir.
- Exactly right, Ms. Walker.
And here's the incentive I'm offering to each of you today.
I'm creating a new position.
Vice president of marketing and promotions, overseeing all the malls in the northeast.
The person with the greatest increase in sales by Christmas Eve wins the promotion.
The losers get nothing.
You'll be lucky to keep your jobs.
Good luck!
- By the New Year, you're gonna be working here at corporate with me where you belong.
- You heard?
- I'm the VP of strategic planning.
I know everything that goes on around here.
Finally, a chance for you to get out of that vacant dump.
- It's not a dump.
- I know.
- But it's not the suburbs either.
I mean, how can I compete with them?
- Well, you do have the lowest numbers in the group at the moment, but that just means you got nowhere to go but up.
Hey, I have faith in you.
You can do this.
- A move to corporate by Christmas would be amazing, and a year earlier than I'd hoped.
Do you mind if I take a rain check on our date tonight?
I just really wanna focus on this competition.
- Hey, Jen, you never have to explain a work obligation to me.
- Hey, that's why I love you.
If I get this promotion, I'll be a year ahead of schedule.
- Yeah, well, I'm already a year ahead of schedule to eat my weight in cinnabuns.
So we'll both have something to celebrate.
- I've got a ways to go before I can celebrate.
I've got those sharks from the suburbs breathing down my neck.
How can South Boston compete with the ladies that lunch in Hartford?
Especially when our working class has been hit so hard?
- I know.
Remember when all the rides were full?
- I also remember you throwing up on Jake Donovan when you downed one of those ginormous banana splits from the food court.
- I thought that one was in the vault, missy.
- I need something that makes South Boston Mall a destination for holiday shopping, you know?
Something that inspires people to come to the mall from all over the city, maybe even the suburbs.
Something that makes people wanna open their wallets and spend their hard-earned money.
- Oh!
- Isn't it a little early for that?
- It's never too early in the day to start looking at hot men.
- I mean the holiday sale.
We haven't put up Santa's Village yet.
- Well, clearly, it's working.
Thank you.
Wow!
- Oh, hey, girls!
How are ya?
- Hi!
- Checking out the merchandise?
- Yes, yeah.
- He'll help you out.
- Hello there!
- Have you seen our new line of sequined party dresses?
This one is only $129.99.
- Well, I will take three.
- You know what?
She's fine.
Thank you.
Three?
And he called you "ma'am."
- He can call me whatever he wants.
- Guess it's true what they say.
Sex really sel...
That's it!
We all know that the majority of holiday shopping is done by women, right?
So let me ask you.
What do stay-at-home moms, 20-something career girls and desperate housewives all want to unwrap for Christmas?
Anybody?
I present to you
South Boston Mall's Search for Sexy Santa.
- Whoo!
- That's great!
- Now, the auditions alone will generate all sorts of press.
We'll have a panel to choose the top three.
And the audience will get to crown their own Santa.
- OK, like American Idol, but with hot dudes.
- Exactly.
The winner will get $10,000, half up front and half at the end of business day on Christmas Eve.
He'll do a whole dance number, followed by photographs and a sit-down on his lap.
- Oh!
- Who can resist that, right?
Oh, you're in your uniform.
- Well, didn't you call me in here because you wanna get a jump on the holidays?
Smart move, Jen.
- Actually, Jim, I called you in here because I have to let you go.
- What are you talking about?
Look, I've been Santa at South Boston Mall for 17 years.
I'm a tradition!
- I know.
But we're going in a different direction this year.
HR has a severance package waiting for you, OK?
- Sorry.
That was so sad.
Like you fired my dad or something.
- Don't look at me like that.
I mean, I feel bad too, but I am not gonna get anywhere being everyone's BFF.
You'll see.
This job isn't as easy as you think.
No, I know, I know.
I got stuck in a horrendous line.
Fifty guys?
OK, I'll be right there.
Yeah, I'm coming now.
Sorry.
- Hi!
Sorry, Ms. Walker, it got cold.
But I'll make you a new one.
- OK, thanks, George.
- Hey, there's a line.
- There is.
- Yeah, man, you tell her.
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
I'm just late for work.
- Yeah, work's a grind.
But we all got someplace we need to be.
- Right.
- You know, I think what I'm late for is a little more important than your bike-messenger- delivery thing.
- Wow!
Well, number one, I'm not a bike messenger.
And number two,
I didn't think you Beacon Hill princesses came down here.
- And what makes you think I'm from Beacon Hill?
- The outfit and the attitude.
- Well, genius, I'm actually from the neighbourhood.
Born and bred.
- Could've fooled me.
- You know, I don't think that would be a very difficult thing to do.
- Are you always such a little sweetheart in the morning?
- Only when confronted with jerks like yourself.
- Oh, that hurt.
That stung.
- Yeah, that's true.

So, guys, we have one camera crew, thanks to our guest panellist, TV host Christine Mayweather.
- Oh yeah, girl!
- Remember, we're looking for someone who has the sex appeal of Brad Pitt and someone who has the spirit of Santa Claus.
OK, guys, you'll have 60 seconds to show us you have the looks and the personality to be South Boston Mall's new sexy Santa.
Now remember, only three of you will make it to the final rounds.
You have to give a great first impression.
And good luck!

- No.
Um, hang on.

- Well, we used to watch a dancing show together.

- I mean, he's OK, but what do you think about this guy?
Yes!
- OK.
And what about dumb-but-hot?
- Absolutely.
- Personally, I prefer the juicehead over the pretty boy.
- Let's just put male model to a vote.
All in favour.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Mmm, sorry, blue steel.
OK, this guy, Moretti.
Total poser, right?
- What are you talking about?
He's perfect.
- Are you kidding me?
Using your dead mother to gain points: totally tacky.
- I think he is a tasty morsel.
- Total man candy.
- This guy?
- Are we talking about the same guy?
- Good night.
- Oh, come here.
What do you think of this one?
- Oh, you mean my future husband?
- See?
Look, hello!
- You change your vote on David,
I will vote yes on your juicehead.
- You can't do that!
- How badly do you want metal guy in the top three?
- Bad.
- Exactly.
So let's just say smooth and metro are in.
But the third position, let's not fight over it.
Let's put it to a secret ballot, shall we?
Just vote your conscience.
- Hey!
- What are you still doing here?
- Bike lock's frozen.
- Ever heard of public transportation?
- I like the freedom my bike gives me.
- Oh yeah, it looks really freeing.
- I feel like we kind of got off on the wrong foot.
- Understatement of the century.
- I hope you can be fair in there.
- Fair?
Listen, despite what you might think,
I am a total professional who makes impartial judgments based on true merit.
If you didn't make the cut, you only have yourself to blame.
- So I didn't make the cut.
- I don't know.
I haven't looked at the ballots yet.
I'll be calling the finalists later tonight.
- Have a merry Christmas, Miss Walker!
Maureen!
I thought you ladies would be halfway through your game of cutthroat poker by now.
- But then we would've missed the show.
- What are you talking about?
You weren't supposed to see that.
- Hello, brother!
- Hello!
- Looks like all those tap classes Mom made you take finally paid off.
- Yeah, yeah.
Ham, Canadian bacon.
What's the difference?
Nice of you to finally join us.
- Hey, Dad hasn't seen this, has he?
- You flaunting your lame moves for all of Boston?
- Still not funny.
- David!
- I guess he has.
Hey, Dad, I'm...
- Late again.
Take over for your brother before he scares away all the customers.
- About the auditions...
- I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna hear about it.
I don't wanna see it.
All I wanna see is you helping out here when you're not going to school or studying, OK?
- OK.
- Go on.
- Yeah.
- Two colas.
- Yeah.
- He's not in a good mood.
- He hasn't been in a good mood since the city council's decision to let the Death Star put us out of business.
- So that's why you did it.
- Did what?
- The Santa thing.
I heard the prize is $10,000, which is about what the lawyer said the appeal would cost.
- Desperate times.
- Dad's put everything he has into fighting this thing.
Just don't get his hopes up, OK?
'Cause he's already resigned to having to close this place down on Christmas Eve.
- I don't think I made it past the first round, so there you go.
- Good.
Because the sooner we can all accept that this place is closing, the sooner Dad can deal with it.
David, you remember how hard it was for him to move on after Mom died.
- And losing Moretti's is like losing another family member.
- Yeah.
- Yo!
- "Yo"?
That's how you answer your phone?
- Is this Jennifer Walker?
- Yes, I'm calling to let you know you made it to the choreography round, after which I'll be crowning the Santa based on our audience votes.
- Really?
- Tomorrow, 4:00.
Please don't be late.
- Oh, uh, tomorrow?
- I'm sorry.
Is that a problem for you, Mr. Moretti?
- No, I'll be there... with my tap shoes on.
- Yes, three of our hottest contestants in this round.
You did see the news?
Fantastic!
Yes, um, David Moretti did make the cut.
You're sending a reporter?
Um, that's fantastic.
I will save you a prime spot.
- Where is he?
- You have 2 hot guys in front of you and you're worried about the time?
- Where is David Moretti?
- He called and said he might be a bit late.
- I can't stand lateness.
If he is not here in 2 minutes, he's cut.
- He is the reason all of these people came out.
You can't do that.
- Yeah?
Watch me.
- Wow!
You are so cold.
You know what?
It's kind of hot, like a corporate dominatrix.
- Why are you here?
- Mr. Hillridge couldn't make it, so I decided to be his eyes and ears.
- That's sweet.
- Are you still getting your hair cut here?
I thought I asked you to go to Christophe in Beacon Hill.
He's really good.
- I just haven't had time.
- Hi, Neal.
- Marissa, I didn't even recognize you underneath the poof.
- That's so funny.
- Wow, look at that!
Quite a crowd, huh?
- I can't believe the publicity we're getting.
- I can.
You're a marketing genius.
- I'm here!
I'm here!
- Just on time.
Get up there.
- Hey, I'm really glad you got to look past yesterday morning.
- Oh, no, don't thank me.
If it were up to me, you wouldn't be here.

We want to know why you guys think you should be South Boston Mall's sexy Santa.
- Because...
I'm a hunk...
With a heart.
- Because Boston... shouldn't be deprived of this... for one minute longer.
- My mom used to say...
"Christmas is about family."
And I know a lot of families are going through a tough time right now.
And to be honest, my family's having a hard time too.
And if I can be Santa and bring joy into those families' lives while helping my own...
I would be more than honoured to be a part of it.
Aw!
- Thank you.
- OK, people of South Boston Mall, we want you to cheer as loud as you can for the man that you want crowned.
Well, well, it appears we have a tie.
Let's try this again.
Just like a truckload of tar.
And I couldn't believe it 'cause Mario has got...
- You look like a kid who just lost his bike.
But no, there it is.
- Mm-hmm.
- So what could possibly make you so upset that you're late for a second night in a row?
- Dad, I need to talk to you.
- Aw, you didn't win.
We can't all have a face like this and abs like these.
Don't worry.
I'll get you to the gym, introduce you to the twins.
A little family reunion, OK?
Next year.
- I thought you were done with that.
- Yeah, Dad, we really need to talk.
- It's OK, I forgive you.
The sooner you forget about that stupid competition, the better.
- Right.
Hmm?
- Huh?
Focus.
Focus on your studies.
- Right.
- Get your EMT training.
Get into med school.
Become the first doctor in the family.
One, two, three, huh?
- Yeah.

- I know you don't approve, but that's why I came here to tell you...
- It's not that I don't approve.
I just don't get it.
I thought you were done doing crazy stuff like that.
I'm worried it'll interfere with school.
- Well, it's only for a few weeks, and $10,000 goes a long way towards books and tuitions and stuff.
- I hope you didn't do this for Moretti's.
David, I just spent my entire life savings trying to fight these guys all year.
I don't wanna see you do the same thing.

Put it in the bank.

I don't know how, but I did.

Guys, I don't wanna get Pop's hopes up, but Moretti's has been in this family for 3 generations.
How do we not do everything possible not to save it?

We have to fight.

You're... you're Britney, right?
- Yeah.

Come on!
I think you just hit an artery.
- You haven't been Santa for 24 hours, and already, you're acting like a diva.
- I'm not being a diva.
I just need that leg.

- Thanks, Santa.
- Have a good one, man.
- You too.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
- I see you finally found someone to talk to on your level.
- Well, kids love me.
- I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that you're just a big kid yourself.
- Tell me what's wrong with being a big kid.
- There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
- Sorry, I've just been watching David wrap up a sale.
- Neal McCormick, VP of strategy, Hillridge Enterprises.
- David Moretti, Santa, South Boston Mall.
- Well, hey, thanks for helping Jennifer make this promotion such a success.
She keeps up this momentum, she'll be sure to move to corporate.
Hey, are we about done here?
We're gonna be late for our reservations.
- Oh yeah, we can probably wrap stuff up.
Let's go!
- All right.
Nice to meet you.
- Sure.
- OK, so I want you to go right home.
Get some rest.
- OK.
- Tomorrow's a big night for all of us.
- OK.

- Whoo!
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
- That was so good!
- Huh?
- Did you see those crowds?
They loved you.
- No, they loved us.
Come on.
- Oh!
- You two were so good.
- Oh, thank you.
- Good work, girls!
- Thank you.
- You were amazing!
Uh, you should get yourself cleaned up and get out there for photographs.
There's already a huge line.
- You got it, boss.
Have a good one.
- Wow!
Jennifer, you are doing a fantastic job.
Mr. Hillridge would be sufficiently impressed.
- Really?
Have you heard anything about how we're doing compared to the other malls?
- New Haven's doing a petting zoo right inside the mall.
And Paramus hired a couple of twin stars to do a concert series.
But don't be concerned about other malls.
Be concerned with what's happening here.
You got lots of people in the mall.
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Well, at the rate he's going, that lineup's about, what, 3 hours long?
When do we close?
- Three hours.
- People standing in line can't spend money.
See you after work, OK?
- OK.
- Well, it looks like somebody had a rough year.
Smile.
- David.
- Just wait one little second.
What?
- Twenty seconds per customer.
That's the plan.
We're competing with malls with double our revenue.
- But it's Christmas.
Look at her.
- Exactly.
We have to exceed our last year's holiday sales.
People in line cannot spend money.
- Santa has all the time in the world for you.
So now tell me what happened to that little wing of yours.
- I crashed my bike on the sidewalk.
- Next time you're riding a bike and you get scared, think of me and I'll be watching over you.
- Really?
Thank you, Santa.
You're the best.
- Nah, you're the best.
Get out of here.
So sweet.
- Why would you do that?
- I know, I know.
I'm a terrible Santa.
- No, one day, she's gonna grow up and realize there is no Santa.
- I don't understand it.
How does someone who's so clearly against the spirit of the holiday be in charge of promoting it?
- Don't take it personally, OK?
Jen didn't exactly have the best home life.
And it's like you said in your audition.
Christmas is about family, and the holiday's just a reminder of what's missing.
- It's too bad.
- Mwah!
- Hey!
- Good.
- Speed it up, Santa.
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- It's not fast enough.
- Are you never satisfied?
- I'll be satisfied when I win my promotion.
Smile.
- I am smiling.
- Like you mean it.
- It hurts.
- What's wrong?
Sit down.
Sit down here.
- Can't breathe.
- Are you all right?
Just sit down for a second.
- Oh my God!
Are you OK?
- Senior down in Santa's Village.
Someone call 911.
Call 911.
- Roger that.
I'm on it.
- Security's on its way.
- OK, hang on.
All right, she has no pulse.
- Oh my God!
- Come on.
Come on.
- Oh my God!
- Oh!
Did I die and go to heaven?
- Close.
You're at the South Boston Mall.
And an ambulance is on its way.
- I'm in no rush.
- OK.
- I had no idea you were getting your EMT certification.
- There's a little something called conversation.
You ask me a question about my life,
I ask questions about yours and so on and so forth.
- OK, great.
Mrs. Clark, you're in good hands, OK?
- I know.
- You may wanna do some tests for a concussion.
- I'll help you with that Christmas shopping when you're ready.
It's a promise.
- Hmm!
- Where are you going?
- Hey, would you punch me out, OK?
I'll make up the hours tomorrow, I promise.
- Dr. McSexy.
I think I'm in love.
- Is that David?
- No, Mrs. Clark.
It's Jennifer Walker, director of marketing and promotions from South Boston Mall.
We met yesterday.
- Don't take it personally.
She hopes everyone who comes through the door is him.
You know, he spent all night with her here.
- Really?
- Now he's all she wants to see.
I don't blame her.
He is one hot Santa.
- Yeah.
Look, Mrs. Clark,
I just wanted to make sure you were doing all right.
- Oh, I'll be a lot better when I can get out of this hospital bed and then see Sexy in action.
- Jennifer.
What are you doing here?
Don't you have a sales report to obsess over or a holiday temp to fire?
- Is that what you really think of me?
- Actually, I think you're one of the more interesting, complicated and yes, at times, infuriating women I've ever met.
- Well, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Those sales reports aren't going to obsess over themselves.
- No, they won't.
- And don't be late.
Mr. Hillridge himself is coming to check out the show.
- Hmm!
Mrs. Clark kept talking about the pretty girl that came to visit her this morning.
- I knew we should've cut your hair.
- Not me, smart ass.
You.
I think, deep down inside, you might actually be...
Wait for it... a nice person.
- There's no secret warm-and-fuzzy Jennifer.
- I see a girl that eats her meals here.
- No time to go out and eat.
- And laughs hard when she's with the Jeremies.
- They should be a stand-up routine.
- And loves this mall.
- OK, I've been working here since I was 17.
Of course I've developed relationships and routines with people, but that's just, you know, a means to an end.
- Admit you love it.
- No.
- "I love it."
- Stop.
- Do you really want that promotion?
I mean, this place isn't gonna be remotely the same without you.
- Why do you even care?
You'll be long gone.
Besides, I've trained Marissa perfectly to take over when I go to corporate.
- Whoo!
I feel like a Christmas present.
♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪
- Yeah, I could see that.
- Just be on your best behaviour, OK?
And that means...
- Twenty seconds per customer.
I get it, I get it.
- Excuse me.
Thanks.
- There we go.
- The line's always busy, sir.
- Afternoon, ladies.
Welcome.
- Thank you, Britney.
- Have a merry Christmas.
Goodbye.
- Sir, I'd like you to meet David Moretti.
- Hi.
- Nice save out there, David.
- I'm just doing what I can.
- I see you got quite the crowd.
- Oh, that's all part of Jen's brilliant publicity strategy.
Yeah, and I make sure they do not linger on my lap too long so they can get out there and spend their hard-earned money at your mall.
- You better be sure to keep this one happy, Jennifer.
He's your golden Christmas goose.
- Yes, sir.
- Nice to meet you, David.
- You heard the guy.
Goose.
- It seems like everything's running smoothly.
Nice job.
- So are we in the running?
- You've moved up to 4th place.
- That's great, right?
- It's a little more complicated than that.
I'm afraid there's more than just a promotion on the line.
- What are you talking about?
I've decided to close the lowest-producing malls after the first of the year.
And as of right now, yours is, well, in the line of fire.
- Sir, but we've improved so much.
- Even if you're up 20%, you're still way behind the rest in terms of gross profit.
This little promotion of yours is giving it a nice bump, but it's just a bump.
Unless you come in number one, we're shutting you down.
- Mr. Hillridge, you can't.
- This is strictly confidential, not to be discussed with anyone on staff.
- We have over 900 people working at this mall.
This mall's the largest employer in the community.
Couldn't we discuss this?
- Come in first, and there won't be anything to discuss.
- All of my friends are goin that I'm gonna be on national TV.
- OK, you do know that Good Morning Boston is a regional show, right?
- Yeah.
- OK.
Where is David?
- Yo!
- Where are you?
- Good morning to you too, Miss Walker.
- You have to be on in 30 minutes.
What is your ETA?
- Well, someone locked their...
- Let me guess.
Your bike.
- I could take a bus.
- No, that'll take too long.
I'll send you a car.
- Why don't you come pick me up yourself?
- Look, a taxi would be quicker.
- Well, you remember what Mr. Hillridge said about keeping me happy.
- I'll be right there.
- Make me happy.

- So, Sexy, tell us, what was going through your head when Mrs. Clark passed out right in front of you?
- I wasn't really thinking.
I was more reacting.
And when she came to, all I could think about was
I didn't want her grandkids not to have her for Christmas.
Aw!
- And Britney, you get to be in this guy's arms every night.
You're the luckiest girl in Boston.
- I know.
- Hmm!
And I saw you guys on opening night.
And you guys have such amazing chemistry together.
Does that translate off stage?
- Well...
- Oh, I don't kiss and tell.

All right.
When we come back, exotic pets and the people who love them.
- Ooh, like reindeer.

I gotta do lunch service.
- Why don't you ask Britney for a ride?
- 'Cause Britney gets lost in the shoe department at Macy's.
- Fine.
So this is your place.
- Yes.
- This was my dad's favourite place.
I think he even took me here once or twice.
- No kidding.
Well, what's his name?
Maybe I served him or something.
- That's unlikely.
He... he left when I was 5.
- Well, my son the star.
- You saw it.
- Of course.
You're a local hero.
- Oh!
Dad, this is Jennifer Walker.
My dad.
- Hi!
His boss.
- Oh!
You poor thing.
- Yeah.
- If anyone can understand how difficult a job that is, it's me.
Come on inside.
We'll make you a pizza.
- Um, you know what?
I can't.
I have to get back to work.
But thank you.
- You can't do anything that's not scheduled in your BlackBerry?
Nothing?
- I don't take no for an answer.
Come on.
- It's true.
He doesn't take no for an answer.
You have no choice.
- OK, he doesn't take no.
Um, I'd love to help.
I just have to get back to work.
- Come on, do something that's not planned for once.
- That is the woman from the mall
David was complaining about.
- No, I believe the words he used were "unlikable bi..."
- Uh, well, he sure seems to like her now.
- OK, what kind of pie do you like to make, huh?
- Um, I actually...
That's sweet, but I'm OK.
I don't eat pizza.
It's like carbs.
When I was a kid, I'd get pepperoni.
- Ah, purist!
I like that.
- Mm-hmm.
- David, get an apron.
You're gonna learn how to toss dough.
- Oh, no, David, I...
- He's the boss, so just do it.
- OK.
Oh!
- Ready?
- I think so.
- OK.
Flick the wrist then let go.
Flick the wrist and then let go.
- It's not too hard.
Oh!
Sorry.
- No, it's good.
- You're using too much arm and not enough wrist.
Gentle, gentle.
See?
- Hmm!
- Gentle.
- Yeah.
- Hey, uh, sorry.
Pop can get pretty persistent at times.
- No, don't apologize.
He seems sweet.
I'm glad he cares so much.
- Yeah.
- So that must be your mom.
- Yes, it is.
She loved Christmas.
She made this giant feast every year.
- It certainly sounds like a better Christmas than I had growing up.
Chinese takeout and a bottle of wine.
The wine was for my mom, not me.
- So is that the plan this year?
Chinese takeout, bottle of wine with Mom?
- Uh, yes to the Chinese takeout.
No to the mom.
She died when I was 17.
- I'm sorry, Jen.
But nobody should spend Christmas alone.
- It's just another day.
It's not a big deal.
Are those yours?
- Yes, I need to study whenever I can.
- So you what?
You work for your family.
- Mm-hmm.
- You go to school and you moonlight at our mall.
- Yeah.
- I had no idea you were that ambitious.
- Hmm!
Because when you first met me, you thought I was a bike messenger.
So I'm not really giving you that much stock in your powers of perception.
- Mm-hmm.
What's that?
- That is a big corporation trying to put us out of business.
Come here.
To make room for that beacon of steel and glass.
- How can they do that?
- Money.
That's how they got the other local merchants to give up the fight.
We're the only holdouts.
But we're running out of time.
- So you're not closing Christmas Eve.
- Not if I can help it.
This building has been around forever.
I'm trying to get it designated a historical landmark.
- Hmm!
You think that's gonna work?
- Oh, it's gotta work.
I have just enough money for one last appeal.
- And the city council votes on Christmas Eve. -00 a.m.
- So that's why you took the Santa job.
- No, I did it for all the pretty girls and free meals.
- Ah!
- Hey, listen, um, Pop doesn't know about the appeal.
He's too proud to ask for help.
- That's very noble of you, David.
- It's not noble.
It's family.
It's what you're supposed to do.
- Oh no!
No, no, I forgot!
I'm late.
- Pop's just about to fire up a pizza.
- I'm sorry, I can't cancel this.
Thank you.
- So, when's the wedding?
- Me and her?
Besides, she's got a boyfriend.
Some corporate bigwig.
- Your mom had a boyfriend when we first met.
I'm just saying.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey!
- Sorry.
The taping went later than I thought.
- Well, we only have 45 minutes for lunch now.
I ordered you a caprese salad.
- Oh.
- I've got a meeting with the lawyers at 2:00.
We're settling on some condos in South Carolina.
- I thought Hillridge only invested in commercial real estate.
- Our business plans adapt whenever there's good opportunities.
- Hey, did, uh, did Hillridge say anything to you about shutting down the lowest-producing malls?
Neal!
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm responsible for the jobs and the lives of 900 people.
I can't even imagine the effect it'll have on South Boston if we closed.
- It's not gonna happen.
- What about the petting zoo in New Haven or the tween concert series in Paramus?
I can't compete with that.
- The petting zoo in New Haven was a P.R. disaster after one of the donkeys escaped
And those tweens, they had to cancel.
Jen, my dear.
You are gonna win that promotion.
You're gonna come in number one.
You're gonna get out of that dump.
You're gonna work with me in corporate.
- It's not a dump, Neal.
- It's just a figure of speech.
So, I was thinking, um,
I usually celebrate Christmas with my parents in Aspen.
Why don't you come?
- We've been together for over a year and you've never introduced me to them.
- Well, they can be a little hard on newcomers, but, um, I think it's time.
- I have an idea.
What if we do something fun and romantic for once, like a pizza-making course together, just the two of us.
It'll be great.
- Well, don't be ridiculous.
I mean, Aspen is the place to be over the holidays.
I don't wanna upset my parents.
Don't be silly.
- I wasn't thinking.
I was more reacting.
Well, when she came through, all I could think about was
I don't want her grandkids to spend Christmas without her.
- Really happy our sales are up.
The Santa promotion is working really well, so we're happy.
Have a good night.
Hey!
- Hey.
- OK, you either had a Scarface moment or you need some dandruff shampoo, pronto.
- No, that's just flour from David's restaurant.
- What?
You had lunch with David?
Dish!
- OK, calm down.
I didn't have lunch with David.
I dropped him at the pizza place and then I had lunch with Neal.

Anyway, Neal invited me to Aspen to have Christmas with his family.
- Wow!
Christmas with the Stepfords, how fabulous!
- Well, I'd love to hear you bash my boyfriend, but we really need to be analyzing these numbers, instead of my love life.
- Why, I thought we were kickin' ass.
- I've just been going over the latest figures, and it looks like we've plateaued.
I really need to keep up the traffic.
- I'm sure we'll get a bump from the television appearance today.
- Yes, but is he on Twitter?
Is he on Facebook?
We can't just keep relying on what we've done in the past.
We really need to push until we're number one.
- You know, if we weren't best friends,
I'd start to be a little offended that you're so desperate to get this promotion and get away from us.
- If you could just do your job, please...
- Yes, boss.
- Hey.
- What are you still doing here?
- What are you still doing here?
Had the guys at Jamba Juice put this in the refrigerator.
I hope you don't mind cold pizza.
- Are you kidding me?
My mom used to work nights.
Cold pizza for breakfast was a Walker staple.
But I can't.
- I know, I know.
The carbs, the carbs.
But think of Leo when he finds out that you threw away a perfectly good Moretti's pizza.
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I would.
I absolutely would, yeah.
And you don't want to be on the receiving end of Leo's wrath, believe me.
- Fine.
Mmm!
So this is what I've been missing out on all these years.
- Amongst other things, yes.
- I'm not that uptight, OK?
I once ate an entire vat of butter-cream frosting from the food-court bakery on one of Marissa's dares.
- Shut up!
- And this one time, I drove the getaway car when the Jeremys decided to T.P.

- It's more complicated than that, Marissa.
- Then let me simplify it for you, OK?
Tell David before you become someone I don't know or like at all.
For about 10 years.
10 years?
Let me know if you need fashion tips.
- I would love one.
- Here you go.
- Hey, David, have you seen Jennifer?
- No.
- Who is she and what did she do to you?
OK, thanks.
- If you want my advice, tell her how you feel.
Before things get too weird and you enter that purgatory known as the friend zone.
Give me a call.
- I absolutely will.
That's fantastic.
Would you like a drink?
- Yes, thanks.
- Maybe you should take your own advice.
- David, what are you doing here?
You have to be on in 5 minutes.
- I know, but I found something out today that put everything into perspective and I really need to talk to you.
- Yeah, I did too.
There's something you should know.
- I know you have a boyfriend and I know you're on this corporate path that probably doesn't include someone like me.
- Someone like you?
David, anybody would be lucky to have someone like you!
- They denied our request for an appeal.
- What?
I thought they weren't voting until Christmas Eve.
- Councilman Quinn ordered an emergency meeting today.
- Councilman Quinn.
- They didn't even let us argue our case and then I couldn't go through life if I didn't do the same for you.
- David, I need to...
- Jen...
You have to admit you felt something when we kissed.
I know I felt it.
I felt it like a ton of bricks.
I mean, I've never, ever met anyone who excites me or frustrates me as much as you do.
I wanna give this a shot.
- David, I don't know how to tell you this.
Hillridge is behind Archfield Towers.
He's the reason your family is going out of business.
- Wait, wait.
What?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, but you know Hillridge.
You could talk to him, right?
- I can't.
My hands are tied.
You knew about this all along?
- No!
- I introduced you to my family!
How could you do that?
- You don't understand.
- You're right, I don't understand anything about you.
I quit.
- You can't.
- Really?
Watch me.
- No, it's in your contract.
Hillridge will sue you if you walk out voluntarily.
You'll lose everything!
- I already have.
- It's like watching one of those creepy, robotic Santas in the department store windows.
- I know.
I've never seen David this crushed before.
Trust me, I tried when I first met him.
- At least you can sleep easy, knowing you did the right thing by telling him.
- Marissa, what's the point?
I mean, we're so different, it'll never work.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Ah!
- Hi.
- It's so sad.
Like the last day of camp.
- Oh, don't, don't.
I'll see you around the neighbourhood.
Hey, and don't forget about those community college classes we talked about.
- I won't.
- Listen.
Underneath her tough exterior,
Jen really does have a heart.
- I know, but it's buried pretty deep.
- Hey, hear her out.
It's not as bad as it seems.
And besides, it's Christmas, and everyone deserves a little charity at Christmas.
- Yeah, but Jen doesn't believe in Christmas.
Remember?
Marissa said, uh, to come get my check from you.
You were worth every penny.
- Glad I could help advance corporate greed.
- That's not what I meant.
David....
I hope you have a merry Christmas.
- I hope when you get everything you want... that it was all worth it.
- Me to.
- You know, I've worked here my entire life.
I'm gonna look forward not coming home at night covered in flour.
- I feel like they've taken our Christmas.
- Oh, come on, baby.
No, no, no.
Come on.
What did Mama always say, hmm?
A good Christmas isn't about gifts, it's about...
- Family!
And nobody can take that away from us, OK?
So instead of dwelling on all we lost this year, let's count our blessings on all we still have, huh?
A beautiful, healthy family.
Another baby on the way.
You OK?
- I just don't understand how Hillridge could take Moretti's away from us and to not even give it a 2nd thought.
And to think, Dad, I was part of that machine.
- Well, you couldn't have known anything about it.
Don't beat yourself up over it.
Well, is that the only thing bothering you?
Jennifer.
Hmm!
You told me she said she didn't know anything about it and that she was brutally honest in the past.
Why would she lie about this now?
- People say things to get what they want.
- Hmm...
I find it hard to believe that it's all about the bottom line for her.
You know, Jennifer may have a tough exterior, but...
I thought she was a real sweetheart.
- Jennifer Walker.
- Jennifer.
- Mr. Hillridge.
- Did I catch you at a bad time?
- Uh, no, this is a perfect time.
- I just finished going over the numbers.
You've really outdone yourself, Jennifer.
Your holiday revenue is up 25%.
I don't know how you did it.
- Wait, does this...
- Congratulations, yes.
You are my new V.P. of Marketing.
Next year, you'll be working with me at corporate.
- You're kidding.
We're number one?
- Yes.
Uh, there's just one more thing.
I'm gonna need you to spearhead the closing of the mall first.
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry, H.R. will be in touch about setting up exit interviews.
- Wait, you said that if we came in number one the mall would be safe.
- Those numbers aren't sustainable, not without Christmas, not without our Santa.
- Look, Mr. Hillridge, these are good people.
They need their jobs.
- We will do a final inventory January 31st before making the announcement.
We gotta keep everyone on their toes.
- No, sir!
Please just...
- Look, don't let this overshadow what you've accomplished, Jennifer.
You've given yourself the best Christmas present possible.
We'll celebrate at the party tonight.
See you then.
- Merry Christmas to me.
- Is that Kate?
She's getting so big.
- 8 years old.
Can you believe it?
She made me take her to see Santa about 5 times.
I think she's starting to discover boys.
Heaven help me.
- Hey, Jen.
- Congratulations on the promotion!
- Whee!
- We hate to see you go.
But what an exciting Christmas surprise.
Um, I hope you don't mind, but David invited us to the Moretti closing party tonight.
Oh, um, no!
Go, please, by all means.
I mean, have fun.
I have to stay with the suits all night.
- Listen, we know you already have on that boring, black dress, but now that you're the V.P. of marketing, we thought you should have something with a little more fab factor.
Ta-da!
- God!
That's gorgeous, but...
- What?
What's wrong?
- I'm...
I'm just really gonna miss you guys.
- Aw, Jen!
We're family.
And, hey, even though you're moving downtown, does not mean you can't come here and help me kill a dozen Cinnabon every now and then.
- Hmm...
- Promise?
- Yeah.
Come here.

Welcome to the party.
Is that the Grinch or Jennifer Walker trying to sneak by Santa?
- Hi, Jim.
I guess I deserve that, huh?
Look, if it means anything,
I feel really bad about how I treated you.
- I appreciated that.
I, uh, miss all my old friends at the mall.
But, hey, I hear congratulations are in order.
Looks like you got everything you wanted for Christmas.
- Thanks, Jim.
- I've been trying to call you all day.
Where have you been?
Congratulations!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
You got what you always wanted, a promotion to corporate.
Why aren't you celebrating?
- They're closing the mall, Neal.
How can I celebrate, knowing the people that helped me get my promotion will be out of jobs by the new year?
- It's collateral damage.
Don't worry.
They'll find something else.
- You knew?
- I know everything that happens at Hillridge.
Come on, babe.
Be happy!
Besides, you're not the only one celebrating a promotion.
- Really?
- You are looking at the new senior V.P. of Strategy.
Hillridge rewards resourcefulness.
- Resourcefulness?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that what you call brokering deals with corrupt politicians?
Hillridge would never invest in residential real estate.
You bribed the councilman, didn't you?
- We needed him to kill the merchant's appeal in order to push the Archfield Towers development through.
Yeah.
Jen, we both did what we had to do to get our promotion.
Don't look at me like that.
- Well, maybe I don't like what I see anymore.
I guess you call that collateral damage.
- Welcome, everyone.
To Hillridge Enterprises annual executive holiday gathering.
But my first order of business tonight is to congratulate our newest vice president,
Jennifer Walker.
She's a long-time employee, having started out here as a floater at the age of 17.
And her victory was made possible by a brilliant re-branding of our holiday business model, with the success of her South Boston Santa.
Jennifer, a few words.
- Oh!
Well done!
- Congratulations!
- Christmas was nothing more to me than one of the biggest retail opportunities of the year.
But as someone very wise said...
Christmas isn't about sales reports or profits.
It's about family.
And since I really have none to speak of, the people of South Boston Mall have become my family.
And collateral damage or not...
I can't just sit back and celebrate the destruction of that family.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
Jennifer!
- Jennifer.
Jennifer.
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- You close South Boston Mall and I'll go public with your backroom deals.
- You don't wanna play that game with me.
- You should be proud, sir.
I learned from the best.
And while you're at it, find a new home for Archfield towers.
Doesn't fit in the neighbourhood.
Merry Christmas.
Taxi!
- Jennifer?
Are you OK?
- Yeah.
No, I...
I can't get a cab and I have to get to Old Town before Christmas Eve is over.
- Well, hold on.
I'll help you.
- Why would you help me?
I...
I probably ruined your Christmas.
- You can't ruin my Christmas!
Christmas is about family, remember?
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
- Merry Christmas.
- Moretti's Pizza.
I tried that!
- Hi, there!
You must be David's brother!
- Yes, younger and sexier.
- You know, next year I will be in charge of hiring sexy Santa.
So you wanna give me a little preview of what you got goin' on in there?
- I don't think you can handle what I got goin' on in here.
- Is that right?
- That one.
- My mom's making me a Christmas Tofurkey tomorrow.
You wanna come by?
- I'll bring the soy eggnog.
- You read my mind.
- Great minds think alike.

- Hey, big guy.
Hey, um, got an early Christmas present for you.
And you don't need to thank me.
So, I want you to take this and I want you to put this towards opening Moretti's in a new location.
- I've had a good run, son.
Don't worry about your old man.
I've lived through a lot worse and I'm still here.
Keep it and you put it down as down payment for med school.
It's what your mom would've wanted.
Well, it's almost midnight.
Wanna help me take down the Moretti's sign?
Thought it might look nice hanging over the couch.
- I can't.
I've lost so much lately, I don't...
I don't think I could dismantle the place.
Sorry, Pop.
- Jen!
Why aren't you celebrating your promotion?
- Some things are more important than what's listed on your 10-year plan.
Marissa, I'm sorry I've been such a bad friend these past few months.
- Hey!
We're best friends.
Forget it!
Come here!
- Where's David?
- He went home.
So should you.
- Don't mind him.
You want David?
- Yeah.
- Follow me.
There he is.
- What are you doing here?
- I turned down the promotion.
- Why?
- I honestly didn't know
Hillridge was behind Archfield Towers until recently.
But I should have told you immediately.
I know, but I didn't want to make the same mistake again.
So when I found that Hillridge bribed Councilman Quinn with a condo in South Carolina...
I told him he wasn't gonna get away with it.
- You did all this for Moretti's?
- I did it because it's the right thing to do.
- Ah...
- And I did it for you.
- What?
So...
- Could you just let me speak or I'll never get this out, OK?
We got off on the wrong foot.
The wrong planet, actually.
Um...
You bring out something in me that I have never felt before.
I used to think that Christmas was just another day.
I don't want to spend another Christmas alone at home.
I want to spend it with family.
I want to spend it with you.
OK, you can speak now.
- Stop telling me what to do.
Stop packing.
Stop packing, stop packing, stop packing!
- David, what's going on?
- Well, thanks to Jen, we are saving Moretti's!

- Don't you just love Christmas?
- The only thing I love about Christmas is the fact that we're about to make a third of our yearly sales in 6 weeks.
- Every year around the holidays, you put on this Grinch routine.
But deep down, I know you are just a big softie who loves Santa and babies and rainbows.
Admit it.
- You watch too many Christmas movies.
Are those the QED reports?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Hmm...
It's not straight.
- Oh, I thought it reminded me of my ex-boyfriend.
- Hey, Jen!
What do you think?
Does it look good on me?
- You better hurry up.
We open in 5 minutes.
- Oh, I am loving the whole illusion today.
Who put that together for you?
- Hmm, you guys did.
- Aw, she's even wearing those cute little black heels we picked out for her at the 75%-off sale.
- You have 5 minutes.
- Fierce.
(Siren wailing)
(Clearing throat)
- Today, the official countdown begins.
35 % of our annual retail profits are gonna be earned over the next 6 weeks.
Now, is my team prepared?
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm?
Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm, yes, sir.
- Yeah?
Well, so is the competition.
Last year, our holiday sales showed a 12% decline, yet Internet sales rose 35%.
So how can Hillridge Malls compete in this overcrowded market?
- Incentivize customers to come to us, sir.
- Exactly right, Ms. Walker.
And here's the incentive I'm offering to each of you today.
I'm creating a new position.
Vice president of marketing and promotions, overseeing all the malls in the northeast.
The person with the greatest increase in sales by Christmas Eve wins the promotion.
The losers get nothing.
You'll be lucky to keep your jobs.
Good luck!
- By the New Year, you're gonna be working here at corporate with me where you belong.
- You heard?
- I'm the VP of strategic planning.
I know everything that goes on around here.
Finally, a chance for you to get out of that vacant dump.
- It's not a dump.
- I know.
- But it's not the suburbs either.
I mean, how can I compete with them?
- Well, you do have the lowest numbers in the group at the moment, but that just means you got nowhere to go but up.
Hey, I have faith in you.
You can do this.
- A move to corporate by Christmas would be amazing, and a year earlier than I'd hoped.
Do you mind if I take a rain check on our date tonight?
I just really wanna focus on this competition.
- Hey, Jen, you never have to explain a work obligation to me.
- Hey, that's why I love you.
If I get this promotion, I'll be a year ahead of schedule.
- Yeah, well, I'm already a year ahead of schedule to eat my weight in cinnabuns.
So we'll both have something to celebrate.
- I've got a ways to go before I can celebrate.
I've got those sharks from the suburbs breathing down my neck.
How can South Boston compete with the ladies that lunch in Hartford?
Especially when our working class has been hit so hard?
- I know.
Remember when all the rides were full?
- I also remember you throwing up on Jake Donovan when you downed one of those ginormous banana splits from the food court.
- I thought that one was in the vault, missy.
(Laughs)
- I need something that makes South Boston Mall a destination for holiday shopping, you know?
Something that inspires people to come to the mall from all over the city, maybe even the suburbs.
Something that makes people wanna open their wallets and spend their hard-earned money.
- Oh!
(Laughing)
- Isn't it a little early for that?
- It's never too early in the day to start looking at hot men.
- I mean the holiday sale.
We haven't put up Santa's Village yet.
- Well, clearly, it's working.

That's it!
We all know that the majority of holiday shopping is done by women, right?
So let me ask you.
What do stay-at-home moms, 20-something career girls and desperate housewives all want to unwrap for Christmas?
Anybody?
(Clearing throat)
I present to you
South Boston Mall's Search for Sexy Santa.
- Whoo!
- That's great!
- Now, the auditions alone will generate all sorts of press.
We'll have a panel to choose the top three.
And the audience will get to crown their own Santa.
- OK, like American Idol, but with hot dudes.
- Exactly.
The winner will get $10,000, half up front and half at the end of business day on Christmas Eve.
He'll do a whole dance number, followed by photographs and a sit-down on his lap.
- Oh!
- Who can resist that, right?
Oh, you're in your uniform.
- Well, didn't you call me in here because you wanna get a jump on the holidays?
Smart move, Jen.
- Actually, Jim, I called you in here because I have to let you go.
(Phone ringing in distance)
- What are you talking about?
Look, I've been Santa at South Boston Mall for 17 years.
I'm a tradition!
- I know.
But we're going in a different direction this year.
HR has a severance package waiting for you, OK?
- Sorry.
That was so sad.
Like you fired my dad or something.
- Don't look at me like that.
I mean, I feel bad too, but I am not gonna get anywhere being everyone's BFF.
You'll see.
This job isn't as easy as you think.
No, I know, I know.
I got stuck in a horrendous line.
Fifty guys?
OK, I'll be right there.
Yeah, I'm coming now.
Sorry.
- Hi!
Sorry, Ms. Walker, it got cold.
But I'll make you a new one.
- OK, thanks, George.
- Hey, there's a line.
- There is.
- Yeah, man, you tell her.
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
I'm just late for work.
- Yeah, work's a grind.
But we all got someplace we need to be.
- Right.
- You know, I think what I'm late for is a little more important than your bike-messenger- delivery thing.
- Wow!
Well, number one, I'm not a bike messenger.
And number two,
I didn't think you Beacon Hill princesses came down here.
- And what makes you think I'm from Beacon Hill?
- The outfit and the attitude.
- Well, genius, I'm actually from the neighbourhood.
Born and bred.
- Could've fooled me.
- You know, I don't think that would be a very difficult thing to do.
(Laughs)
- Are you always such a little sweetheart in the morning?
- Only when confronted with jerks like yourself.
- Oh, that hurt.
That stung.

(Laughing)
- Still not funny.
- David!
- I guess he has.
Hey, Dad, I'm...
- Late again.
Take over for your brother before he scares away all the customers.
- About the auditions...
- I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna hear about it.
I don't wanna see it.
All I wanna see is you helping out here when you're not going to school or studying, OK?
- OK.
- Go on.
- Yeah.
- Two colas.
- Yeah.
- He's not in a good mood.
- He hasn't been in a good mood since the city council's decision to let the Death Star put us out of business.
- So that's why you did it.
- Did what?
- The Santa thing.
I heard the prize is $10,000, which is about what the lawyer said the appeal would cost.
- Desperate times.
- Dad's put everything he has into fighting this thing.
Just don't get his hopes up, OK?
'Cause he's already resigned to having to close this place down on Christmas Eve.
- I don't think I made it past the first round, so there you go.
- Good.
Because the sooner we can all accept that this place is closing, the sooner Dad can deal with it.
David, you remember how hard it was for him to move on after Mom died.
- And losing Moretti's is like losing another family member.
- Yeah.
(Cellular ringing)
- Yo!
- "Yo"?
That's how you answer your phone?
- Is this Jennifer Walker?
- Yes, I'm calling to let you know you made it to the choreography round, after which I'll be crowning the Santa based on our audience votes.
- Really?
- Tomorrow, 4:00.
Please don't be late.
- Oh, uh, tomorrow?
- I'm sorry.
Is that a problem for you, Mr. Moretti?
- No, I'll be there... with my tap shoes on.
- Yes, three of our hottest contestants in this round.
(Phone ringing)
You did see the news?
Fantastic!
(Sighing)
Yes, um, David Moretti did make the cut.
(Phone ringing)
You're sending a reporter?
Um, that's fantastic.
I will save you a prime spot.
- Where is he?
- You have 2 hot guys in front of you and you're worried about the time?
- Where is David Moretti?
- He called and said he might be a bit late.
- I can't stand lateness.
If he is not here in 2 minutes, he's cut.
- He is the reason all of these people came out.
You can't do that.
- Yeah?
Watch me.
- Wow!
You are so cold.
You know what?
It's kind of hot, like a corporate dominatrix.
(Imitating whip cracking)
(Sighing)
- Why are you here?
- Mr. Hillridge couldn't make it, so I decided to be his eyes and ears.
- That's sweet.
- Are you still getting your hair cut here?
I thought I asked you to go to Christophe in Beacon Hill.
He's really good.
- I just haven't had time.
- Hi, Neal.
- Marissa, I didn't even recognize you underneath the poof.
- That's so funny.
- Wow, look at that!
Quite a crowd, huh?
- I can't believe the publicity we're getting.
- I can.
You're a marketing genius.
- I'm here!
I'm here!
- Just on time.
Get up there.
- Hey, I'm really glad you got to look past yesterday morning.
- Oh, no, don't thank me.
If it were up to me, you wouldn't be here.
- Well then, I'm glad it's not up to you.

We want to know why you guys think you should be South Boston Mall's sexy Santa.
- Because...
I'm a hunk... (Cheering and laughing)
With a heart.
- Because Boston... shouldn't be deprived of this... for one minute longer.
- My mom used to say...
"Christmas is about family."
And I know a lot of families are going through a tough time right now.
And to be honest, my family's having a hard time too.
And if I can be Santa and bring joy into those families' lives while helping my own...
I would be more than honoured to be a part of it.
- (All):
Aw!
- Thank you.
(Cheering)
- OK, people of South Boston Mall, we want you to cheer as loud as you can for the man that you want crowned.

But no, there it is.
- Mm-hmm.
- So what could possibly make you so upset that you're late for a second night in a row?
- Dad, I need to talk to you.
- Aw, you didn't win.
We can't all have a face like this and abs like these.
Don't worry.
I'll get you to the gym, introduce you to the twins.
A little family reunion, OK?
Next year.
(Laughing)
- I thought you were done with that.
- Yeah, Dad, we really need to talk.
- It's OK, I forgive you.
The sooner you forget about that stupid competition, the better.
- Right.
Hmm?
- Huh?
Focus.
Focus on your studies.
- Right.
- Get your EMT training.
Get into med school.
Become the first doctor in the family.
One, two, three, huh?
- Yeah.

- I know you don't approve, but that's why I came here to tell you...
- It's not that I don't approve.
I just don't get it.
I thought you were done doing crazy stuff like that.
I'm worried it'll interfere with school.
- Well, it's only for a few weeks, and $10,000 goes a long way towards books and tuitions and stuff.
- I hope you didn't do this for Moretti's.
David, I just spent my entire life savings trying to fight these guys all year.
I don't wanna see you do the same thing.
- Come on, take that money.
Put it in the bank.
We can't win.
OK?
- OK.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
Oh... (Laughing softly)
- Ah!
- Hey!
- Hey!
- So you won, huh?
(Laughing)
- I did.
I don't know how, but I did.
- Because you're gorgeous.
That's why.
- Thank you, sister.
Guys, I don't wanna get Pop's hopes up, but Moretti's has been in this family for 3 generations.
How do we not do everything possible not to save it?
- You're right.
We have to fight.
- To the bitter end.
- To Moretti's.
- (All):
To Moretti's.
- Hi!
- Hey!
- I really enjoyed our dance.
- Aw, thanks.
You're... you're Britney, right?
- Yeah.
- Oh man!
Come on!
I think you just hit an artery.
- You haven't been Santa for 24 hours, and already, you're acting like a diva.
- I'm not being a diva.
I just need that leg.
- Listen, I'm gonna tell you a secret.

Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
- That was so good!
- Huh?
- Did you see those crowds?
They loved you.
- No, they loved us.
Come on.
- Oh!
- You two were so good.
- Oh, thank you.
- Good work, girls!
- Thank you.
- You were amazing!
(Laughing)
Uh, you should get yourself cleaned up and get out there for photographs.
There's already a huge line.
- You got it, boss.
(Dog yapping)
(Camera clicking)
Have a good one.
- Wow!
Jennifer, you are doing a fantastic job.
Mr. Hillridge would be sufficiently impressed.
- Really?
Have you heard anything about how we're doing compared to the other malls?
- New Haven's doing a petting zoo right inside the mall.
And Paramus hired a couple of twin stars to do a concert series.
But don't be concerned about other malls.
Be concerned with what's happening here.
You got lots of people in the mall.
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Well, at the rate he's going, that lineup's about, what, 3 hours long?
When do we close?
- Three hours.
- People standing in line can't spend money.
See you after work, OK?
- OK.
- Well, it looks like somebody had a rough year.
Smile.
(Camera clicking)
- David.
- Just wait one little second.
What?
- Twenty seconds per customer.
That's the plan.
We're competing with malls with double our revenue.
- But it's Christmas.
Look at her.
- Exactly.
We have to exceed our last year's holiday sales.
People in line cannot spend money.
(Sighing)
- Santa has all the time in the world for you.
So now tell me what happened to that little wing of yours.
- I crashed my bike on the sidewalk.
- Next time you're riding a bike and you get scared, think of me and I'll be watching over you.
- Really?
Thank you, Santa.
You're the best.
- Nah, you're the best.
Get out of here.
So sweet.
- Why would you do that?
- I know, I know.
I'm a terrible Santa.
- No, one day, she's gonna grow up and realize there is no Santa.
- I don't understand it.
How does someone who's so clearly against the spirit of the holiday be in charge of promoting it?
- Don't take it personally, OK?
Jen didn't exactly have the best home life.
And it's like you said in your audition.
Christmas is about family, and the holiday's just a reminder of what's missing.
- It's too bad.
(Whistle blowing)
- Mwah!
- Hey!
- Good.
- Speed it up, Santa.
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- It's not fast enough.
- Are you never satisfied?
- I'll be satisfied when I win my promotion.
Smile.
- I am smiling.
- Like you mean it.
- It hurts.
- What's wrong?
Sit down.
Sit down here.
- Can't breathe.
- Are you all right?
Just sit down for a second.
- Oh my God!
Are you OK?
- Senior down in Santa's Village.
Someone call 911.
Call 911.
- Roger that.
I'm on it.
- Security's on its way.
- OK, hang on.
All right, she has no pulse.
- Oh my God!
- Come on.
Come on.
- Oh my God!
- Oh!
Did I die and go to heaven?
- Close.
You're at the South Boston Mall.
And an ambulance is on its way.
- I'm in no rush.
- OK.
(Siren beeping)
- I had no idea you were getting your EMT certification.
- There's a little something called conversation.
You ask me a question about my life,
I ask questions about yours and so on and so forth.
- OK, great.
Mrs. Clark, you're in good hands, OK?
- I know.
- You may wanna do some tests for a concussion.
- I'll help you with that Christmas shopping when you're ready.
It's a promise.
- Hmm!
- Where are you going?
- Hey, would you punch me out, OK?
I'll make up the hours tomorrow, I promise.
(Exhaling)
- Dr. McSexy.
I think I'm in love.
(Siren wailing)
(Siren wailing)
(Knocking on door)
- Is that David?
- No, Mrs. Clark.
It's Jennifer Walker, director of marketing and promotions from South Boston Mall.
We met yesterday.
- Don't take it personally.
She hopes everyone who comes through the door is him.
You know, he spent all night with her here.
- Really?
- Now he's all she wants to see.
I don't blame her.
He is one hot Santa.
- Yeah.
Look, Mrs. Clark,
I just wanted to make sure you were doing all right.
- Oh, I'll be a lot better when I can get out of this hospital bed and then see Sexy in action.
(All laughing)
(Door opening)
- Jennifer.
What are you doing here?
Don't you have a sales report to obsess over or a holiday temp to fire?
- Is that what you really think of me?
- Actually, I think you're one of the more interesting, complicated and yes, at times, infuriating women I've ever met.
- Well, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Those sales reports aren't going to obsess over themselves.
- No, they won't.
- And don't be late.
Mr. Hillridge himself is coming to check out the show.
- Hmm!
Mrs. Clark kept talking about the pretty girl that came to visit her this morning.
- I knew we should've cut your hair.
- Not me, smart ass.
You.
I think, deep down inside, you might actually be...
Wait for it... a nice person.
- There's no secret warm-and-fuzzy Jennifer.
- I see a girl that eats her meals here.
- No time to go out and eat.
- And laughs hard when she's with the Jeremies.
- They should be a stand-up routine.
- And loves this mall.
- OK, I've been working here since I was 17.
Of course I've developed relationships and routines with people, but that's just, you know, a means to an end.
- Admit you love it.
- No.
- "I love it."
- Stop.
- Do you really want that promotion?
I mean, this place isn't gonna be remotely the same without you.
- Why do you even care?
You'll be long gone.
Besides, I've trained Marissa perfectly to take over when I go to corporate.
- Whoo!
I feel like a Christmas present.
♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪
- Yeah, I could see that.

- Just be on your best behaviour, OK?

- Excuse me.
Thanks.
- There we go.
- The line's always busy, sir.
- Afternoon, ladies.
Welcome.
- Thank you, Britney.
- Have a merry Christmas.
Goodbye.
- Sir, I'd like you to meet David Moretti.
- Hi.
- Nice save out there, David.
- I'm just doing what I can.
- I see you got quite the crowd.
- Oh, that's all part of Jen's brilliant publicity strategy.
Yeah, and I make sure they do not linger on my lap too long so they can get out there and spend their hard-earned money at your mall.
- You better be sure to keep this one happy, Jennifer.
He's your golden Christmas goose.
- Yes, sir.
- Nice to meet you, David.
- You heard the guy.
Goose.
- It seems like everything's running smoothly.
Nice job.
- So are we in the running?
- You've moved up to 4th place.
- That's great, right?
- It's a little more complicated than that.
I'm afraid there's more than just a promotion on the line.
- What are you talking about?
I've decided to close the lowest-producing malls after the first of the year.
And as of right now, yours is, well, in the line of fire.
- Sir, but we've improved so much.
- Even if you're up 20%, you're still way behind the rest in terms of gross profit.
This little promotion of yours is giving it a nice bump, but it's just a bump.
Unless you come in number one, we're shutting you down.
- Mr. Hillridge, you can't.
- This is strictly confidential, not to be discussed with anyone on staff.
- We have over 900 people working at this mall.
This mall's the largest employer in the community.
Couldn't we discuss this?
- Come in first, and there won't be anything to discuss.
(Engine starting)
(Car driving away)
- All of my friends are goin that I'm gonna be on national TV.
- OK, you do know that Good Morning Boston is a regional show, right?
- Yeah.
- OK.
Where is David?
(Siren wailing in distance)
(Sighing)
(Cellular ringing)
- Yo!
- Where are you?
- Good morning to you too, Miss Walker.
- You have to be on in 30 minutes.
What is your ETA?
- Well, someone locked their...
- Let me guess.
Your bike.
- I could take a bus.
- No, that'll take too long.
I'll send you a car.
- Why don't you come pick me up yourself?
- Look, a taxi would be quicker.
- Well, you remember what Mr. Hillridge said about keeping me happy.
(Sighing)
- I'll be right there.
- Make me happy.

- Yes.
- This was my dad's favourite place.

- No kidding.
Well, what's his name?

- That is the woman from the mall
David was complaining about.
- No, I believe the words he used were "unlikable bi..."
- Uh, well, he sure seems to like her now.
- OK, what kind of pie do you like to make, huh?
- Um, I actually...
That's sweet, but I'm OK.
I don't eat pizza.
It's like carbs.
When I was a kid, I'd get pepperoni.
- Ah, purist!
I like that.
- Mm-hmm.
- David, get an apron.
You're gonna learn how to toss dough.
- Oh, no, David, I...
- He's the boss, so just do it.
- OK.
Oh!
(Clearing throat)
- Ready?
- I think so.
- OK.
Flick the wrist then let go.
Flick the wrist and then let go.
- It's not too hard.
Oh!

Pop can get pretty persistent at times.
- No, don't apologize.

I'm glad he cares so much.
- Yeah.
(Laughing)
- So that must be your mom.
- Yes, it is.
She loved Christmas.
She made this giant feast every year.
- It certainly sounds like a better Christmas than I had growing up.
Chinese takeout and a bottle of wine.
The wine was for my mom, not me.
- So is that the plan this year?
Chinese takeout, bottle of wine with Mom?
- Uh, yes to the Chinese takeout.
No to the mom.
She died when I was 17.
- I'm sorry, Jen.
But nobody should spend Christmas alone.
- It's just another day.
It's not a big deal.
Are those yours?
- Yes, I need to study whenever I can.
- So you what?
You work for your family.
- Mm-hmm.
- You go to school and you moonlight at our mall.
- Yeah.
- I had no idea you were that ambitious.
- Hmm!
Because when you first met me, you thought I was a bike messenger.
So I'm not really giving you that much stock in your powers of perception.
- Mm-hmm.
What's that?
- That is a big corporation trying to put us out of business.
Come here.
To make room for that beacon of steel and glass.
- How can they do that?
- Money.
That's how they got the other local merchants to give up the fight.
We're the only holdouts.
But we're running out of time.
- So you're not closing Christmas Eve.
- Not if I can help it.
This building has been around forever.
I'm trying to get it designated a historical landmark.
- Hmm!
You think that's gonna work?
- Oh, it's gotta work.
I have just enough money for one last appeal.
And the city council votes on Christmas Eve. 10:00 a.m.
- So that's why you took the Santa job.
- No, I did it for all the pretty girls and free meals.
- Ah!
(Both laughing)
- Hey, listen, um, Pop doesn't know about the appeal.
He's too proud to ask for help.
- That's very noble of you, David.
- It's not noble.
It's family.
It's what you're supposed to do.
(Cellular chiming)
- Oh no!
No, no, I forgot!
I'm late.
- Pop's just about to fire up a pizza.
- I'm sorry, I can't cancel this.
Thank you.

- So, when's the wedding?

- Hey.
- Oh, hey!
- Sorry.
The taping went later than I thought.
- Well, we only have 45 minutes for lunch now.
I ordered you a caprese salad.
- Oh.
- I've got a meeting with the lawyers at 2:00.
We're settling on some condos in South Carolina.
- I thought Hillridge only invested in commercial real estate.
- Our business plans adapt whenever there's good opportunities.
(Sighing)
- Hey, did, uh, did Hillridge say anything to you about shutting down the lowest-producing malls?
Neal!
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm responsible for the jobs and the lives of 900 people.
I can't even imagine the effect it'll have on South Boston if we closed.
- It's not gonna happen.
- What about the petting zoo in New Haven or the tween concert series in Paramus?
I can't compete with that.
- The petting zoo in New Haven was a P.R. disaster after one of the donkeys escaped
And those tweens, they had to cancel.
Jen, my dear.
You are gonna win that promotion.
You're gonna come in number one.
You're gonna get out of that dump.
You're gonna work with me in corporate.
- It's not a dump, Neal.
- It's just a figure of speech.
So, I was thinking, um,
I usually celebrate Christmas with my parents in Aspen.
Why don't you come?
- We've been together for over a year and you've never introduced me to them.
- Well, they can be a little hard on newcomers, but, um, I think it's time.
- I have an idea.
What if we do something fun and romantic for once, like a pizza-making course together, just the two of us.
It'll be great.
- Well, don't be ridiculous.
I mean, Aspen is the place to be over the holidays.
I don't wanna upset my parents.
Don't be silly.
- I wasn't thinking.
I was more reacting.
Well, when she came through, all I could think about was
I don't want her grandkids to spend Christmas without her.
- Really happy our sales are up.
The Santa promotion is working really well, so we're happy.
Have a good night.
Hey!
- Hey.
- OK, you either had a Scarface moment or you need some dandruff shampoo, pronto.
- No, that's just flour from David's restaurant.
- What?
You had lunch with David?
Dish!
- OK, calm down.
I didn't have lunch with David.
I dropped him at the pizza place and then I had lunch with Neal.

- David?

Anyway, Neal invited me to Aspen to have Christmas with his family.
- Wow!
Christmas with the Stepfords, how fabulous!
- Well, I'd love to hear you bash my boyfriend, but we really need to be analyzing these numbers, instead of my love life.
- Why, I thought we were kickin' ass.
- I've just been going over the latest figures, and it looks like we've plateaued.
I really need to keep up the traffic.
- I'm sure we'll get a bump from the television appearance today.
- Yes, but is he on Twitter?
Is he on Facebook?
We can't just keep relying on what we've done in the past.
We really need to push until we're number one.
- You know, if we weren't best friends,
I'd start to be a little offended that you're so desperate to get this promotion and get away from us.
- If you could just do your job, please...
- Yes, boss.
- Hey.
- What are you still doing here?
- What are you still doing here?
Had the guys at Jamba Juice put this in the refrigerator.
I hope you don't mind cold pizza.
- Are you kidding me?
My mom used to work nights.
Cold pizza for breakfast was a Walker staple.
But I can't.
- I know, I know.
The carbs, the carbs.
But think of Leo when he finds out that you threw away a perfectly good Moretti's pizza.
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I would.
I absolutely would, yeah.
And you don't want to be on the receiving end of Leo's wrath, believe me.
- Fine.
Mmm!
So this is what I've been missing out on all these years.
- Amongst other things, yes.
- I'm not that uptight, OK?
I once ate an entire vat of butter-cream frosting from the food-court bakery on one of Marissa's dares.
- Shut up!
- And this one time, I drove the getaway car when the Jeremys decided to T.P.
Marissa's jerky ex-boyfriend's prized Camaro.

Actually, it's about Archfield Towers.
- Archfield Towers.
I thought saving the jobs of 900 people at South Boston Mall was your number-one priority.

- If I tell David, he might quit and that's not acceptable when we're one week away from Christmas Eve and when we're one spot away from being number one.
- I don't get you anymore, Jen.
David's family is losing their livelihood, and all you stand to lose is a stupid promotion.
I mean, have you really gotten that cold?
- It's more complicated than that, Marissa.
- Then let me simplify it for you, OK?
Tell David before you become someone I don't know or like at all.
- (Man):
For about 10 years.
- (Jeremy): 10 years?
Let me know if you need fashion tips.
- I would love one.

- I absolutely will.
That's fantastic.
Would you like a drink?
- Yes, thanks.

- David, what are you doing here?
You have to be on in 5 minutes.
- I know, but I found something out today that put everything into perspective and I really need to talk to you.
- Yeah, I did too.
There's something you should know.
- I know you have a boyfriend and I know you're on this corporate path that probably doesn't include someone like me.
- Someone like you?
David, anybody would be lucky to have someone like you!
- They denied our request for an appeal.
- What?
I thought they weren't voting until Christmas Eve.
- Councilman Quinn ordered an emergency meeting today.
- Councilman Quinn.
- They didn't even let us argue our case and then I couldn't go through life if I didn't do the same for you.
- David, I need to...
- Jen...
You have to admit you felt something when we kissed.
I know I felt it.
I felt it like a ton of bricks.
I mean, I've never, ever met anyone who excites me or frustrates me as much as you do.
I wanna give this a shot.
- David, I don't know how to tell you this.
Hillridge is behind Archfield Towers.
He's the reason your family is going out of business.
- Wait, wait.
What?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, but you know Hillridge.
You could talk to him, right?
- I can't.
My hands are tied.

You knew about this all along?
- No!
(Stammering)
- I introduced you to my family!
How could you do that?
- You don't understand.
- You're right, I don't understand anything about you.
I quit.
- You can't.
- Really?
Watch me.
- No, it's in your contract.
Hillridge will sue you if you walk out voluntarily.
You'll lose everything!

- I just don't understand how Hillridge could take Moretti's away from us and to not even give it a 2nd thought.
And to think, Dad, I was part of that machine.
- Well, you couldn't have known anything about it.
Don't beat yourself up over it.
Well, is that the only thing bothering you?

Hmm!
You told me she said she didn't know anything about it and that she was brutally honest in the past.
Why would she lie about this now?

- You're kidding.
We're number one?
- Yes.
Uh, there's just one more thing.
I'm gonna need you to spearhead the closing of the mall first.
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry, H.R. will be in touch about setting up exit interviews.
- Wait, you said that if we came in number one the mall would be safe.
- Those numbers aren't sustainable, not without Christmas, not without our Santa.
- Look, Mr. Hillridge, these are good people.
They need their jobs.
- We will do a final inventory January 31st before making the announcement.
We gotta keep everyone on their toes.
- No, sir!
Please just...
- Look, don't let this overshadow what you've accomplished, Jennifer.
You've given yourself the best Christmas present possible.
We'll celebrate at the party tonight.

Why aren't you celebrating?

How can I celebrate, knowing the people that helped me get my promotion will be out of jobs by the new year?

- Resourcefulness?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that what you call brokering deals with corrupt politicians?
Hillridge would never invest in residential real estate.
You bribed the councilman, didn't you?
- We needed him to kill the merchant's appeal in order to push the Archfield Towers development through.
Yeah.
Jen, we both did what we had to do to get our promotion.
Don't look at me like that.

But my first order of business tonight is to congratulate our newest vice president,
Jennifer Walker.

And her victory was made possible by a brilliant re-branding of our holiday business model, with the success of her South Boston Santa.
Jennifer, a few words.
(Applause)
- Oh!
Well done!
- Congratulations!
(Sighing)
- Christmas was nothing more to me than one of the biggest retail opportunities of the year.
But as someone very wise said...
Christmas isn't about sales reports or profits.
It's about family.
And since I really have none to speak of, the people of South Boston Mall have become my family.
And collateral damage or not...
I can't just sit back and celebrate the destruction of that family.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
- (Man):
Jennifer!
- Jennifer.
Jennifer.
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- You close South Boston Mall and I'll go public with your backroom deals.
- You don't wanna play that game with me.
- You should be proud, sir.
I learned from the best.
And while you're at it, find a new home for Archfield towers.

- You did all this for Moretti's?
- I did it because it's the right thing to do.
- Ah...
- And I did it for you.
- What?
So...
- Could you just let me speak or I'll never get this out, OK?
We got off on the wrong foot.

I used to think that Christmas was just another day.
I don't want to spend another Christmas alone at home.
I want to spend it with family.
I want to spend it with you.

Are we gonna have a ceremony?
I don't know.
Lauren's got 'em.
Ask her.
I'll just give her some time.
It's only been a week.
Now, what about you?
Are you sure about going back to work already?
Well, I kinda owe it to dad.
You know, it's his firm, but it's your life.
Yeah, but those things are really connected.
Look, I gotta go to Debbie's crime.
Good luck today.
- All right.
- Don't forget to call Lauren.
- Oh, you know me.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Coffee, black, please.
- Sure.
- Gimme the money.
- Okay.
Gimme the money!
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on!
Screw you, pal!
Screw me?
Screw you!
Okay.
Hold on a second.
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.
Just put the gun down, 'cause you don't wanna hurt anybody, all right?
How's that coffee comin' along?
Um...
You seem like the kinda guy who knows what he's doing.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, so, uh...
We're not gonna have any problems here, right?
Yeah.
No.
Right.
Okay, good.
So just tuck the gun back under your shirt, 'cause you don't want someone to walk by, and then they see you and...
Right?
How we doing on that coffee?
Good.
Now, educate me.
What do you get when you rob a store?
You...
You know, money.
Right.
How much?
Gimme a number.
- 500 bucks?
- Yeah, right!
5...
Forget it, man!
Let's just say 100.
All right?
You get shot...
The emergency room is gonna cost you a grand.
So just give the guy 100 bucks.
- I'm gonna give him something.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.
What are you gonna buy with the money?
Beer.
And, uh... beef jerky.
Beer and jerky.
Nice.
That's a balanced meal.
So how much does...
Let's say 50 bucks of beer and jerky cost you?
- 17.50.
- 7... 17.50?
Are you kidding me?
- Who's robbing who?
- Hey, come on!
All right, fine, fine, fine.
So how does 50 bucks of beer and jerky sound to you?
I mean, I assume you're gonna be running, right?
- So that's all you can carry.
- That's...
Yeah, okay.
Okay, good.
So... 17.50 wholesale...
And we go on with our day.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
And my coffee, right?
You're gonna get my coffee.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.
Okay, good.
Black.
Okay.
There you go.
And, uh...
How 'bout this?
Good.
Okay?
- Ha ha!
- All right.
You're welcome.
Hey, hey, hey, that... that's 5.75.
For coffee and a cookie?
Those are organic.
- Spencer.
- Did you call Lauren?
- Nope.
I got held up.
- Kate...
- Gotta go.
Love you!
- Kate!
Ah...
Leo, my Leo.
Good morning.
Welcome back.
You look great.
Oh, what can I say?
Grief suits me.
Yeah.
Oh, you should try this.
It's apple chai tea infusion.
Eew.
I hate those girly drinks, Leo.
Your loss.
It's appletastic.
Uh, judge Nicastro's office called.
You're expected in his court at 11:30.
- He's got a case for you.
- Doesn't judge Nicastro know
I'm not a practicing attorney anymore?
It's a mediation.
You were specifically requested.
Okay, that's weird.
He hates me.
Yes.
Yes, he does.
You're supposed to say, "no, he doesn't, he loves you."
- Any other calls?
- Lauren.
That bitch just can't help herself.
- I mean, it's my first day back.
- Kate.
My father is not even cold in the ground.
- We can't all be obsessive-compulsive...
- Kate!
- Anal retentive...
- Ah!
She's right behind me, isn't she?
Kate.
I need you.
Now.
Yes.
Right.
I was just going over my schedule here with Leonardo.
- You need me back...
- ASAP.
S-a-p.
You have a tendency to panic.
You have a tendency not to.
Um, now that dad's gone, are you still my evil stepmother or just the evil managing partner?
Have you been to Masa's lately?
- What?
- Boulevard.
Aqua.
Gary Danko.
No.
I haven't done much dining out lately.
I've been mourning the death of my father.
You?
Hey.
I miss my husband.
Every minute.
But instead of sulking,
I am trying to protect the firm he loved.
By running up your expense account?
Oh, grow up, Kate.
Every law firm in San Francisco is wining and dining our clients, telling them to jump ship...
and it's working.
Ortho West left for Morrison Foerster, the Rixton Group for Wilson Sonsini, and Tinker Connelly, Ird Pallbearer, right side, dropped us the day...
Of the funeral.
I called his son from the limo and over drinks at the Morgan tonight,
I will get that business back.
Teddy Reed is dead.
Reed Reed is on life support.
I will do whatever it takes to keep it alive.
What can I do?
You know Charles and Douglas Pease.
Yeah, sure.
Pease, inc.
Women's clothing.
They're a big client.
Well, as you know, they've agreed to be bought out by a Canadian company.
Douglas will be in charge.
His father retires with a generous severance.
So what's the problem?
Well, they were supposed to sign the contracts today, but the old man called me this morning and tried to back out.
No deal for them, no fees for us.
Now, I convinced Charles to come in and talk it out with Douglas, but we need those contracts signed.
Get them on the same page.
That's what I do.
Pastels.
Primaries.
Stripes.
Solids.
- You have no idea, do you?
- That's not the point, is it?
- Gentlemen...
- You don't know what to think unless somebody graphs it for you.
- Gentlemen...
- Are you gonna run the company?
No.
You're gonna let bean counters...
Gentlemen...
You know Kate Reed.
Hey, Charlie, Doug.
I'm sorry about your father.
He was a good man.
I'll miss him.
Thank you.
- I'll miss him too.
- Thank you so much, Doug.
That's my boy.
Never an original thought.
Since we seem to be at an impasse,
I thought it might be helpful if Kate got involved.
We don't need a mediator.
Thanks anyway, Kate.
- I've made my decision.
- Right.
I've heard.
It took 14 months to put this deal together.
He was with it every step of the way.
This is his deal, and he won't sign it.
Well, he doesn't have to if he doesn't want to.
- That's not...
- But...
Do you mind just telling me,
Charlie, because this is so not like you:
What's the story?
Where's your head at?
Spring 1993.
I ordered Capri pants.
Everyone else... the gap, the limited...
They're all thinking bells.
I cleaned their clocks.
All of them.
That was a fantastic time, Charles.
What has that got to do with...
The business is not in your blood.
You don't feel it.
I built the company on instinct, intuition.
And that's your strength, Charlie.
And I'm sure that Doug has his own.
I have my MBA from Stanford.
I make decisions based on statistical analysis,
- trend-spotting.
- Pie charts.
We've had ten consecutive losing quarters.
We blame the economy, and so far everyone believes us.
But it's been a long time, dad,
- since you've cleaned anyone's clock.
- Okay okay, clearly you two approach things differently, but here's the part that I don't understand.
That was true 14 months ago when you started negotiating this buyout.
It was true a week ago, and it was true yesterday.
So what changed?
- Tell her about last night.
- It has nothing to do with...
- It's about judgment, Douglas.
- Please, dad.
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, Charlie.
What happened?
I was coming home from dinner with clients.
I was on the 280 heading south.
I'd just got on the bridge.
A red sedan crossed over the line and bumped me.
What the hell?
Whatcha gonna say now?
Whatcha gotta say?
I don't remember the impact.
It was instinct, you know, turning away from the gun.
I didn't...
See them at all.
- It just happened so fast.
- Did anyone I.D. the sedan?
Well, a good samaritan called it in, and there's a second witness.
The driver and gunman are in custody.
Now, if we go through this buyout...
We have to disclose the details of any pending legal action.
Well, someone pointed a gun at him.
- He's blameless.
- He was drunk.
Douglas had a blood alcohol level that was elevated.
- .09.
- Drunk.
I had two glasses of wine.
That's not why I crashed.
The courts aren't gonna see it that way.
- Of course they're not.
- And that's exactly why you don't want this to go to court.
So how do we put these thugs in jail and clean up Doug's mess?
Charlie, I was an attorney for five years.
I quit to become a mediator.
You wanna know why?
In court, somebody wins, but there's always a loser.
And it doesn't necessarily have to do with who's right and who's wrong.
Now, if we go to court, this is gonna limp through the system for 18 months and all the while, Doug's DUI is gonna become public record, which is exactly what you don't want.
I'm not just gonna stand by and do nothing.
Okay, the kids in the car...
that's an open and shut case.
The system's gonna take care of them.
They'll probably be offered some kind of plea bargain.
Our only concern is Doug's DUI.
We handle that, the deal can move forward, right?
Absolutely.
Charles?
Great.
So we're all back on the same page.
Win-win.
And you know what?
Kate has a unique connection to the d.A.'S office.
I am sure she'd be happy to use it.
Especially for such important clients like you.
Lauren, may I have a word with you, please?
Excuse us, gentlemen.
My father would never ask me to do this.
No, you're right.
He wouldn't.
He'd ask me to ask you.
It's business, Kate.
We use what we have.
Our clients can go anywhere for legal services.
Hell, they can get half of what they need off the Internet.
They come to us for our connections.
You have one.
We're using it.
Just do something with my father's ashes.
- Coffee.
Black, three sugars.
- You're forgiven.
- Where ya goin'?
- Hell.
He wasn't driving erratically or over the speed limit.
In fact, the legality of a sobriety test, given the circumstances, is questionable at best.
- You missed me.
- That's not why I'm here.
Well, you could have called.
- Lauren asked me to...
- Yeah, I know.
But you could have called.
Instead, you came over.
Because it's important.
Because you feel guilty about last night.
Why would I feel guilty about last night?
Oh, you're saying you're not here because you feel guilty?
Yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
- So you miss me.
- You're such a dick.
All right.
You're gonna like this.
Your gunman's got an extensive record.
Pointing a firearm at another driver from a moving vehicle's a class a felony.
- He's gonna do ten years.
- Can I see?
No, no, no.
Ha.
Attorneys only.
Sorry.
The driver's also looking at ten reducible to five.
Well, those are stiff sentences.
- My client will be happy.
- Pretty standard stuff, actually.
There's the possibility of catastrophic loss of life.
The vehicle itself is a weapon.
The gun compounds the threat.
The law was designed to keep gangbangers from taking their beefs on the road.
And what about my guy's DUI?
Well...
He's got no priors.
Given the circumstances, a good lawyer should get it thrown out.
Let's assume he has a good lawyer.
Ha.
Cute.
Okay.
We're done.
This wasn't just business, was it, huh?
Come on, be honest, Kate.
This was about us.
Justin...
I'm always honest.
It's my greatest flaw.
Well, it's one of them.
Yeah.
Remind me again why our marriage didn't work.
Ah.
Just did.
I was joking, Kate.
I was kidding.
Kate.
I was kidding.
Wait.
Okay, I get it.
You're angry.
I'm sorry.
This looks familiar.
I apologize.
- Not accepted.
Nope.
- I'm sorry, Kate.
I apologize.
Really familiar.
Could you get her on the phone, please?
Talk to me, Leo.
Hey, don't be late for judge Nicastro.
- He hates to be kept waiting.
- Oh, give me a little credit.
We'll get right outside of his courtroom.
Taxi!
[]
Sorry!
I'm sorry.
Judge, I am so sorry.
Really sorry about this.
No, you're not.
You're Kate Reed.
You have nothing but disdain for the law.
Okay, well, that's not entirely true, sir.
- You quit the profession.
- I'm still in the system.
It's just a...
Different part.
Ha ha.
- Mr. Brian Michaels...
- Yes, sir.
Is suing the three parties involved in his meticulously planned marriage proposal.
The proposal went awry, and his grandmother's wedding ring, appraised at $11,500, was lost.
So Mr. Michaels is requesting of one unemployed actor, one singing waiter, and one cupcake maker...
Damages totaling... $10 million.
Really, Mr. Michaels?
Yeah.
I just want what's fair.
- So do we, your honor!
- Your honor, I have...
Now, as much as I would love to have this case in my courtroom,
I thought that it might be better served elsewhere.
So...
Sit down.
So we're going to try something a little different...
Alternative dispute resolution, also known as mediation.
Bailiff.
- Kate Reed is not...
- Thanks.
A lawyer.
She is a mediator.
A mediator is kind of a referee in a game with no rules, except those agreed to by the parties involved.
Ms. Reed handles all sorts of disputes, some even bigger than yours.
Earlier this year, she was called in by the united nations to settle a border dispute between Colombia and...
Paraguay.
Colombia and Nicaragua, sir.
And it was their embassies here in San Francisco.
They border each other on market street, and they share a common wall.
But the u.N. Did call.
- They did call.
- Ms. Reed.
- Yes, sir.
- Find a way to keep this case out of my court.
- Okay.
- You've got two days.
Two days?
Judge...
There are three defendants, and this guy's asking for $10 million.
Two days doesn't seem exactly...
Okay.
How about tomorrow morning at 9:00?
Would you like to try for later on this afternoon?
- No.
- Find a resolution or you will be sent to prison for contempt of court.
Yes, I can do that.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Bailiff, call the next case.
Kate Reed's office.
Judge Nicastro really does hate me.
No, he doesn't.
He loves you.
That's right.
I forgot.
Okay, so why does he hate me?
Well... there's the fineman debacle.
- Yes.
Right.
- And the examiner interview.
- Okay.
That was bad.
- And the joke you made about his wife and the horse that his wife overheard.
So you're saying it's not random.
Oh.
I never said that.
I like you more every day, Leo.
Okay, um...
The complainants that Nicastro dumped on me will be there at 2:00, so...
Set 'em up for me in the conference room.
Done.
What about the Pease case?
Solved.
I'm amazing.
I'll be back in 20.
Next.
Hey.
Wake up.
- Where is he?
- Out.
- Lunch.
- That son of a bitch!
- Did you not read the file?
- Which file, Kate?
The file you couldn't possibly have read because I didn't give it to you?
The file that would be illegal for you to have in your possession.
Justin, Justin, the driver!
The driver!
Look, I'm in a meeting, Kate.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Sorry.
Hi...
- How'd you know where I was?
- It's Monday.
He'll have a polish with onions and a peach snapple.
- This kid is going to Yale.
- I'm sorry.
Isn't this the same kid you just asked me to put in jail?
Yeah.
But that was before I knew the full story.
Thank you.
- Justin.
Don't do this!
- It's my heart.
- You don't have a heart!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- God!
Read the damn file!
- Hey, I wrote the file!
And if you read it, that's a crime.
I'm gonna go talk to those kids.
Taxi!
Go ahead.
What do you think they're gonna say, huh?
They're gonna say what they always say... "I'm innocent."
I did you a favor.
You asked me to do this.
Certain things have been put in motion...
Hey, Kate!
Sir, can you put your arms out?
Thank you.
- I'm guilty.
- You realize that means...
- I'll do the time.
- D'Sean, this is a class "a" felony.
Nah.
Gun wasn't loaded.
It doesn't matter if the gun was chocolate.
You were in a moving vehicle.
You threatened another driver.
The d.A.'S gonna offer you ten years.
I woulda pulled the trigger if I knew that.
And ten years for Nathan.
Well.
He might only have to do five.
For what?
He was driving.
He's an accessory.
No...
Nathan didn't do nothing, he... my cousin...
- My cousin, he's...
- I know, but listen to me.
- He's clean.
- Listen to me.
- It doesn't work like that.
- Let me do his time.
He doesn't have to go down for what I did.
The courts are not gonna let you do that.
Give it to me!
He didn't do nothin'!
He didn't do nothin'!
He didn't do nothin'!
Say it!
Say he's innocent!
He didn't do nothin'!
He's innocent!
That's my homie!
You wanna take him away?
That's my boy!
"National honor society.
"Big brother.
All-state marching band."
Wow.
You're an impressive kid, Nathan.
Tell me what happened.
We were heading home.
Just...
Driving.
Listening to the radio.
And all of a sudden...
Ha ha ha... yeah, whatever.
What's up?
Don't y'all know how to drive?
What are you doing, man?
He took his piece out.
- You don't know how to drive?
- Yo, D'Sean!
- Yo, man...
Yo, relax!
- It's on, man!
No!
We gonna get pinched!
He wasn't gonna shoot or anything, he just...
That's just D'Sean.
- Chill!
It's all right!
- No, man!
The lady in the car, she saw the gun, I think, and freaked.
You said there was a woman driving the car?
- Yes.
- Did you see a man in the passenger seat or in the back?
I barely saw her.
Okay.
Why did D'Sean have a gun?
Everyone I know's got a gun.
'Cept me.
I'm the good boy.
So what kind of time am I facing?
Ten years.
Five if you plea out of it.
Or you could insist that you go to trial.
Um, you've got no priors.
Roll the dice.
Take my chances?
Well...
Yeah.
From the ghetto to Yale.
Just that right there...
Getting in.
I think I used up all my luck.
I don't believe that.
And you shouldn't either.
Why not?
There was definitely a woman driving the car?
Definitely.
Okay.
You've still got some luck left.
It's black and white, Kate.
Nothing is ever black and white.
The guy had a woman in the car.
That... that's not a crime.
The kids... they pulled a gun.
- That is.
- One.
One kid pulled a gun.
- There's no legal distinction.
- Okay.
But there should be.
What does any of this have to do with your mediation?
Why would Doug lie?
Why would he cop to a DUI when he wasn't even driving?
Because if a guy's gonna lie about anything, it's gonna be about a woman.
Your Doug would rather face a judge than face his wife.
Speaking of...
When's yours coming back?
- Terry's up in Seattle.
- Uh-huh.
Pitching a new account.
But coming back tonight...
For date night.
- Yeah, date night!
- Ooh!
- Ooh.
- Special.
- You got that?
- I thought you hated it
- when dad worked all the time.
- I did.
That's why I quit the firm.
Lila's gonna know her father.
Well, that's good.
At least she'll know one of her parents.
So...
Good work there, dad.
Did you come here to tell me that my marriage sucks?
- No, no, no, I...
- But you think it does.
Look, I just...
I think it's different than what you said you wanted.
I thought mediators were supposed to solve problems.
Sometimes.
And then...
Sometimes they just like to point 'em out, you know...
No charge.
♪ If I were king of the forest ♪
- I don't believe you.
- Talk to me, Leo.
The people from judge Nicastro's court are waiting for you in the conference room.
- Ooh, God damn it.
Oh...
- Nice.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Oh...
Aunt Katie's got a potty mouth!
Uh...
I gotta go.
I love you.
Bye.
- Love ya.
- I'll call you later.
All right.
Leo, something's not right with this Pease thing.
I need to head over there first.
But what about the people in the conference room?
Yeah.
Just tell them I'm running late.
- Oh, no!
Wait, wait!
- Okay.
Soon as my hearing comes back.
Wait!
Wait!
Please!
Ah!
Uh, taxi!
- Totally obsessive!
- O-oh, obsessive?
Y-you were drunk!
Ms. Reed's running late.
- You guys need anything?
- Boom!
I'd like to hear you say, Brian...
You were crying!
So you're all good then.
Okay, then.
I've got some good news and some better news.
I'm comin' in.
All right, well, I talked to the d.A.
The government's looking at ten years, and there is no interest in pursuing Doug's DUI.
Terrific.
That's everything.
I believe it is, yes.
What about the other punk, the driver?
Well, here's the thing.
There's two versions of the accident.
Wrong.
There was one accident.
Two parties involved.
One party of criminals, the other my son.
That's one version.
Do you know who was in the car?
Yeah.
Scumbag one and scumbag two.
D'Sean has a record, but Nathan the driver doesn't.
In fact, he's quite the model citizen.
He's got a full scholarship to Yale.
- He starts in the fall.
- Not anymore.
Nathan Henry's a good kid, Charles... he's smart.
Smart kids choose smart friends, not gun-carrying gangsters.
Well, maybe in the suburbs.
If Douglas grew up in hunter's point, he'd have friends with guns.
Oh, please.
I'm sick of hearing about how getting spanked when you were four gives you license to rob a grocery store when you're 40.
It's an excuse, and I don't buy it.
It is easy to be judgmental when you grow up with wealth.
The children of privilege aren't allowed to fail.
- It's not their fault.
- No, it's not their fault.
- That's right... exactly right.
- So whose fault is it that when you grow up in a lousy neighborhood you study your ass off to make straight as, you get the crap kicked out of you for not being in a gang?
I grew up poor.
I'm not a criminal.
Neither is Nathan Henry.
He not only survived and stayed clean...
He got a full scholarship to Yale.
Now, the gunman, he'll do his time.
He knows it's coming.
But you've gotta let Nathan off the hook.
You lack your father's clarity.
It troubles me.
It troubled him, too, sir.
Dad, maybe we're pushing a little too hard on this.
Does it...
Really matter if this Nathan goes to jail?
Yes.
Again, Douglas, judgment.
- Let's not lose sight of...
- When I asked if you knew who was in the car, I was talking about Doug's.
There was a woman driving his car.
Both boys saw her, and in the police report, a woman's purse was found on the floor.
Now, I don't suppose that your wife ran from the scene of an accident.
Carol-Anne was in L.A.
I'm sure she was.
No I.D. In the purse.
Cheap makeup.
Was she a rental?
Uh, I met her in the bar at the restaurant.
Oh!
What?
What?
Oh, yeah, wake up!
She had a room at a hotel nearby.
Never made it there, tough.
What was her name?
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't even know her name, and you let her drive the beemer?
That's the part that bothers you?
You pick up hookers a lot?
Well...
What's a lot?
Jesus, Douglas.
What's the point of all this?
Well, facts change.
Positions should too.
Everything's not so black and white.
All right, gentlemen,
I, uh, have another meeting to go to.
I'm gonna let you two talk.
Call me later...
And we'll wrap this up.
$10 million!
Do you know how much of a waste of time this is for me right now?
Oh, hey, I need Kate.
Oh, you know what?
She is busy.
She's got a court-ordered mediation.
All right, well, tell her I'm looking for her.
You know I will.
Leonardo!
Leo!
Hey.
Come here.
You know I would never ask you to do anything that comes even close to the border of illegality.
- Oh, I know.
- And I'm not asking you now.
Especially from your dungeons dragons buddies over at the police department or the DMV.
You've not asked me many times before.
Exactly.
This is just like one of those times.
The license plate number for Doug Pease's car.
Find out everything you can about him, the car, the night of the accident...
everything.
Why?
What are you...
What are you looking for?
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem right yet.
- Okay, then.
- Yeah.
Conference room.
I read their file.
What do you think, like...
An hour?
Ugh.
Dinner and a pillow.
Ooh.
Fun.
Ha.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Kate Reed, and I will be your mediator today.
- Hi, Kate.
- Can you please talk
- to that idiot?
- These morons...
- I gotta get out of here.
- A million doll...
Better.
Thank you.
Okay, uh...
Brian Michaels, you wanted to make a memorable wedding proposal to your girlfriend.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Quite a complicated plan.
- Actually, it was very simple.
Oh, please!
- Yeah, like d-day.
- Psycho!
Jessica and I ordered a cable car, which is where we met three years ago.
I hired three people, each one representing one year in our dating history, to board the cable car at three consecutive stops...
The first to read my first love letter to Jessica.
The second to sing, time of my life.
And one was to present us with cupcakes with our faces in the icing.
- Oh, that's sweet.
- I know.
- Okay, so what happened?
- Well, the actor was drunk, the singing was terrible, and the cupcakes...
They looked nothing like us!
I wasn't drunk.
I had vertigo.
- I have talent!
- It doesn't matter.
I proposed anyway.
All right?
I presented Jessica with my grandmother's engagement ring.
She'd given me her father's watch.
He passed away last year.
He loved Brian.
I wanted to give her something just as special.
But their incompetence made us lose the ring.
- We never lost anything.
- You were going crazy!
- He attacked me.
- You murdered our song!
Don't make me...
Whistle again...
Please.
She dropped the ring.
I may have been technically drunk but...
- It's not my fault.
- Well, then whose fault is it?
- Yours!
- All right, Jessica,
Brian proposed.
He gave you the ring.
And then what happened?
Well, I was about to put it on, and then everyone started yelling and someone was trying to pass me, and the cupcake with Brian's face fell in this woman's lap and she screamed, and it...
It was gone, it was just gone.
There was nothing that you could do about it?
No!
I mean, you could have held on to it.
Oh!
I-I'm not saying it's your fault.
- Okay.
What are you saying?
- N-nothing.
I mean, I-I'm saying it could have happened to anyone.
- It's like you said.
- Exactly.
Could it have happened to you, Brian?
No.
I would have held on to it.
Oh, my God, you really do think it's my fault!
I didn't say that.
Actually, you did.
That's not what I meant!
- Okay, what'd you mean?
- N-nothing.
I just... oh, forget it.
I...
I-it's just it's really hard for me to understand.
That's all.
I mean, I would never lose your father's watch.
It's too important to me.
You think I lost the ring because I don't care about it?
That's... eh...
All right.
I'm gonna send you folks home.
- Yes!
- Okay?
So just be in court
- tomorrow morning at 9:00.
- 9:00?
I'm not even awake.
Actually, you know, I'd like to stay
- and watch this for a bit.
- Yeah.
No.
He's got some...issues.
Let's just get this all out right now.
Harrington.
Beware the one who whispers in the night.
He stokes the fire that never dies...
Oh.
Thanks.
Appreciate that.
And walks the eness circle.
What filthy creature of the night dares call by day?
Hey, it's Leonardo.
I need some information.
Open.
Close.
Open.
Close.
It's easy now.
- Open...
Close.
- In here.
Without my maniac fiancé screaming at me and people there freaking out!
It's one hand on the rail, one on the ring.
My leg is free.
Nobody's getting near this!
Nobody!
All right!
I think we got it all out, right?
Most of it.
A lot of it.
Let's just take a break.
Ooh.
Hot date?
Hmph.
Tim Connelly.
Yikes.
Once again, glad I'm not you.
I just got off a call with Charles Pease.
Thought you had everything handled.
- He's calling off the deal.
- But that's absurd, because when I left their office earlier...
You met with Charles and Douglas without me?
Yes.
Well, I-I got some information about the accident.
See, the boy driving the other car...
- Wait.
He's not our client.
- I know that.
But the boy driving the other car is innocent.
But he's not our client.
Aw, Kate...
I call you in to help, and now I've got to clean up your mess.
Wow, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I-I should never let an innocent kid's life stand in the way of our legal fees.
You know, is it me you hate?
Or lawyers in general?
Maybe it's the fact that I married your beloved father.
You know what?
He was beloved to me too.
My father was a lawyer.
My ex-husband is a lawyer.
My brother is a lawyer, and I was a lawyer.
And even though I carry around more than a small amount of self-hatred, if I really hated lawyers, I wouldn't work at a law firm.
And as for marrying my father, yes...
I hate you for that.
I thought my mother made him happy...
Until I saw him with you.
And I don't know what to think about that.
So I hate you.
It's simpler that way.
Is that you, the dwarf?
I'm the gnome.
In wintergrasp.
- Well, what is he doing?
- Defending the keep.
- It looks like he's attacking.
- I'm taking out the towers.
Even when you're playing defense, you've got to attack.
- Interesting.
- Mm-hmm.
Focus on the wrong thing, you get killed.
- I have learned much from you.
- Well, I am the master.
And you've taught me well.
Anything on Doug's car?
Not yet.
Okay.
Go home.
How's it going with the loving couple?
Good.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I feel a breakthrough coming.
Well, I-I'll stick around.
Still got some, uh, work...
To do.
Okay.
You didn't see that coming at all, did ya?
That it was her brother, right?
Oh...
I did not, no.
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
Oh, no, no, no, Tim, I am done.
I have another meeting.
I don't think you do.
You're so funny.
Oh...
Ha.
I get that a lot.
What do you want?
Oh.
It's...
Gratifying to know that I have your company's support.
Reed Reed will continue to provide the level of service...
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Look...
I'm easy, okay?
You guys do good work.
I got no complaints.
The old man was just trying to shake ya down for a better rate, the prick.
Don't worry...
I'm not gonna let him pull our business away.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate the loyalty, and you can be sure
I will go the extra mile to make sure you're happy.
What's that?
Extra mile.
Actually, it's more like an extra couple of floors.
I told ya I was easy.
- Thank you both.
- Our pleasure.
Oh, Tim...
I think we, uh...
Overindulged.
Thank you so much for the business.
Good night.
What, am I too young for you, Lauren?
You'd rather have drinks with my dad?
Hey, Lauren, I want my extra mile, okay?
Can I see your watch?
My watch?
Hmm-hmm.
The one Jessica gave you, her father's watch.
You know what, Brian?
I don't think you're ever gonna forgive Jessica for letting go of your grandmother's ring.
It's kinda hard to understand.
I'm just saying.
So...
The only way for you to get past this is to destroy something important to Jessica.
- Smash the watch.
- What?
- No!
- It's the only way.
And then you'll be even.
- Y-you're crazy.
- Brian.
- It's the only way.
- Brian, no!
- I-I won't do it.
- Oh, come on, do it.
- No!
- Just smash it.
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not gonna smash the watch.
- Smash the watch.
- No.
It was her father's watch.
She gave me the watch.
It's too important, I'm not...
- Aah!
- Oh...
Oh!
Oh, my God, I can't believe you just did that.
I'm so sorry!
What kind of mediator are you?
I loved that watch.
I loved how special it was to you that you wanted me to have it.
But that's how I felt about the ring.
Brian, I was devastated.
I'm sorry I made you feel worse on top of that.
Sorry that I made you feel the way that I do now.
I feel...
Oh, my God.
It's just a watch.
It's just a ring.
They're symbols.
We have the real thing.
I love you, Jessica.
- You, I hate.
- Ditto.
Oh...
Buffy the vampire slayer.
Wrong watch.
Sleight of hand.
It's easy to lose sight of what's important.
You focus on the wrong thing, you get killed.
I stopped breathing for a while.
No, don't do that.
Don't ever do that.
Brian, are you dropping the charges and moving on?
Moving on.
Excellent.
I'll see you in court tomorrow.
I'm awake.
And that's not funny.
Go home.
I haven't heard anything about the car.
It's okay.
Maybe tomorrow.
Definitely.
All right.
- I'm going.
- Okay.
- Oh, Leo?
- Yep.
Uh, you know that
Buffy the vampire slayer watch you have?
- Yeah.
- Well, I wanted to get one for a friend.
Where'd you get it, like toys r us?
Oh, no.
That's one of only three inscribed by Sarah Michelle Geller herself to commemorate the 100th episode.
That's why I keep it locked in the desk drawer.
Oh.
Okay.
Uh...
Well, I guess I'll just have to track down one of the other ones then.
Good luck with that.
It's gonna cost you a fortune.
He's worth it.
Hi, dad.
It's late.
- Yes.
- You home?
No.
You?
What do you think?
Tomorrow morning Nathan's public defender is gonna recommend that he cop a plea.
Why?
He didn't do anything.
I'll offer five years, and he'll take it.
- It's a good deal.
- It's a death sentence, Justin.
Look, I did what you asked, Kate.
He's not going to trail.
You're welcome, by the way.
For what?
He's going to jail.
Yeah.
Could have been worse.
This thing gets in front of a judge,
- the law says a weapon...
- The law, the law, the law!
God, what about the boy whose life is gonna be ruined?
Does he even matter in this?
Go you're just like my dad, you know that?
You make these laws up, and then you hold them up like they're sacred or something, like they're from God, like there's nothing higher.
But guess what, Justin.
There is.
There is justice and there is truth.
And who gets to decide what's true... you?
Five years, Kate.
It's a good deal.
For who?
You know what would be a perfect wedding?
- To elope?
- You're kidding, right?
Because I've already done the seating chart.
It's alphabetized and everything.
Your uncle asked to sit...
It's very late.
Tomorrow Nathan Henry's gonna accept a deal that sends him to prison for five years.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Sorry is meaningless, Doug.
Call the D.A.
He has discretion with the sentence.
Tell him that you don't want Nathan charged.
My father...
Your father doesn't make any sense.
You were in the car.
This is your decision.
I can't.
Why?
It looks like I've lost the job I wanted.
If I go against him, I'll lose him, and if I lose him, I lose the job that I have now.
I lose my house.
I lose...
Everything.
Oh, Doug...
Please.
This is so much bigger than you.
Stand up for Nathan.
Save his life.
Do the right thing.
I envy you.
You always seem to know what that is.
You've reached the cell phone of Teddy Reed.
I'm not currently available.
Leave a message, and I will return your call promptly.
Thank you.
I'll take it to her.
It's mine.
Sorry.
Uh...
You want me to toss it back?
No, hold on to it.
I'll come by tonight and pick it up.
Oh, will you?
I'm Andrew, by the way.
Kate.
Kate, I'm taking the boat out.
Sailing under the bridge.
Wanna come out for a sail?
God, you know what, that just sounds like a great idea.
But, uh, I've got this little thing called a job, you know?
Actually, I don't.
Mm.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Hold on.
Hey!
It was a messenger.
He... he said it was important.
- I was just...
- Psh, psh, psh... this is amazing.
This is epic.
Thank you so much.
This is exactly what I wanted!
Um...
I gotta go.
I can't be late.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You have a fantastic day!
Leo, I've got the picture.
Oh, my God...
Okay.
Uh...
Nathan's supposed to make his plea today, so tell Doug Pease I'm coming over right after court.
Judge Nicastro.
Good news.
Great news!
Mr. Michaels is dropping the lawsuit, and further, he agrees to drop all future lawsuits regarding the failed engagement plans and the loss of his grandmother's ring.
Mr. Michaels, is that true?
- Yes.
- Yes!
As long as I can still sue if something goes wrong with the wedding.
We're gonna have a hot air balloon dropping rose petals...
Enough?
Okay?
You're driving yourself crazy.
- Makin' me crazy.
- I just want the wedding to be everything that the proposal wasn't, you know, unexpected and surprising.
Me too.
Why don't we just get married right now?
W-eh... here?
I mean, why not?
We have everything we need.
We have witnesses and a judge.
I mean, come on!
- Are you surprised?
- Y-yeah!
It's unexpected.
I didn't expect it.
Brian, now or never.
- Now.
- Judge.
By the power vested in me by the state of California,
I now pronounce you man and wife.
- That's it?
- There's some paperwork.
Yay!
Okay.
Picture time.
Smile.
Aw!
Congratulations!
- Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome.
When I have any future conflicts, can I... 15-minute recess.
Newlyweds, meet me in my chambers.
I'm gonna need some signatures, and then you can begin your lifetime of happiness.
- You three are free to go.
- Whoo!
Ha ha!
Thank you.
I really love my watch.
- Later.
- Bye.
Bailiff, take Ms. Reed into custody.
What?
Why?
Because I took a picture?
You were four minutes late.
God.
Everything's a technicality.
- I hate courts.
- I know you do.
Wait, wait, you can't be serious about this.
I mean, does justice look like this?
I knew you'd recognize it when you saw it.
What?
Hold on!
♪ If I were king ♪

Leo.
Hey, are the new contracts in?
They're being messengered over to the Pease building.
Lauren's on her way to see Charles, and Douglas is expecting you.
- Are you almost there?
- I'm walking into the lobby.
Sure, you are.
Hello!
Hello!
Excuse me!
Sir!
Somebody!
Oh!
Justin!
Justin!
Hey!
Hi!
Did you get the message I left?
Yes.
And I moved Nathan's plea to the end of the day.
Oh!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- I really gotta run.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait...
Hold on.
I need a teeny, tiny favor.
Justin!
Is there something specific that's bothering you?
I-is there a deal point that can be improved on?
Maybe the share valuation.
It's just not going to happen, Lauren.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
Please, I just have a couple more thoughts.
Put them in an email.
I'll do that.
We need to look past the third quarter.
Doug!
Doug, hey.
...Can we... can we talk in private?
- No.
- No?
Okay.
Well...
It's amazing technology, these photo cameras.
Uh, go on ahead.
Crystal clear picture, don't you think?
Yep.
What do you want?
I want you to do the right thing.
I'll be in your father's office.
- Kate!
- Excuse me.
What do you want?
I want what I've always wanted, what's best for you, what's best for Doug, and what's best for Nathan Henry.
That young man is not my concern.
No, he's mine.
I was driving.
It's my decision.
I'm gonna ask to have the charges dropped.
I'll let the D.A. know that he'll be hearing from you this morning.
W-what are you doing?
Why are you here?
- Our business is done.
- No, it's not.
Don't contradict me, young lady.
Oh, I always finish what I start, Charlie.
My father taught me that.
He taught me a lotta things.
I'm sure he tried, but I doubt you were really listening.
God, you're just like my dad!
My gosh.
You don't wanna retire because you're afraid you're gonna disappear, but...
Oh, save the psychobabble...
You keep trying to hold on so tightly, Charles, that that's exactly what's gonna happen.
You will disappear, because when you die, everything you know will die with you.
But it doesn't have to.
It can live on.
Is this your way of pushing me out?
- Is this all your idea?
- No.
Douglas's idea is that you stay on as chairman.
Oh, I-I think that is an idea with some merit.
- So now you're on her side.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm on your company's side, Charles, always.
Douglas runs the company as president, and you keep an eye on the big picture.
You mentor him.
You pass down what you know.
That way, you'll have a legacy.
And it'll be around even when you're not.
Douglas has his own ideas.
He doesn't wanna listen to mine...
He never did.
I can try.
You're gonna make me read those damn pie charts, aren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
It's a smart move, Charles.
If I see the word emeritus or acting next to chairman,
- the deal's off.
- No, you'll be the real chairman, dad.
- That's right!
- Charlie.
Are you and Doug on the same page now?
Excellent.
Great.
Well, we'll need to amend the deals.
- I'll have our contractor...
- Hold, please.
I took the liberty.
New contracts.
Now, gentlemen...
If you will...
Just... initial at the XS.
Have you started thinking about next year's summer line?
- Yeah.
A little.
- A little is not good enough.
- We need designs by next month.
- I know.
We'll have them.
A little.
Nice work, boys.
Great.
Well.
Look at that.
Win-win.
You blindsided me.
I got the job done.
- How?
- Trade secret.
No.
I don't think so.
There was no woman in the car.
See, everyone was telling the truth.
There was a woman driving...
And Doug was the only person in the car.
- Hey, yo!
- What the hell?
- You don't know how to drive?
- Oh, God!
Ah!
Yo, put the piece away, man!
Yeah, that's right!
Oh, my...
Why can't you use your desk?
No privacy.
Didn't think you were coming in.
Ohh.
Yeah.
Me neither.
Leo, have you been working out?
Let's not play that charade today.
What?
I gave up my planeswalkers to get that picture.
Dungeons Dragons?
- It's magic cards.
- Magic cards.
Planeswalkers...
Travel through planes of existence.
And they're very hard to get.
Interesting.
Just...
Just say thank you.
Is that a new sweater vest?
You never say thank you.
That's not true.
Thank you.
Kate.
Hey, Lauren.
What?
You wanna give me a raise?
Oh!
No, you are willing to admit that lawyers burn bridges and mediators build them.
You wanna congratulate me on turning the Pease situation into a win-win.
Oh, Lauren...
Your father's ashes are missing.
Really?
You lost the Connelly account and my father's ashes?
Lose-lose!
Kate?
Hello!
It's me.
Hi.
Uh...
It's late.
Did I wake you?
Hold on.
Hey.
So you must have really put the screws to Douglas Pease.
He pushed me really hard to let that kid go.
What'd you have on him?
Sometimes people just do the right thing.
No, they don't.
Not until you make 'em.
You know, you don't have to live out here, Kate.
You took a bad settlement.
Mm.
I don't like conflict.
Well, I'm just saying, I could spot you a year's rent.
You know, you can move back in the neighborhood.
No!
No, no.
I-I like it here.
- Really.
- Yeah.
I have friends.
Hi.
How are you this evening?
Oh... well, they're shy friends.
Can I, uh, you know, come onboard?
- We could talk.
- I have company.
Wow.
Hmm.
New tin man?
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
It's not my place.
You know, uh, maybe another time.
You know what, coffee or something.
- Coffee...
- Maybe.
Okay.
Yeah.
We'll do that.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good night.
- Yep.
Hey, Justin?
Yeah?
Dad thought that you were great.
Maybe even a little too good for me.
Well, he was half-right.
Good night.
Good night.
Okay.
Um...
Let's focus on...
What we have in common.
We...
Both have the same sense of humor.
And nobody has my sense of humor.
We, um...
Ah, yes.
We agree on the important stuff.
And that's important.
Um...
We both have strong beliefs.
You believe in the letter of the law.
It's absolute.
It's always right.
And I believe that laws were made by people...
And that people are often wrong.

Hey, what time is it?
Oh, no.
Oh, no-no-no.
You're not supposed to be here.
Oh, that's not the deal.
- Come on, K, we don't have a deal.
- We have a deal.
We most definitely have a deal.
- There is no sex, ever.
- Oh, come on.
And though we do have sex doesn't spend the night.
All right, you know what?
As much as I'd love to stay and discuss the final points of our deal,
I have to go.
I have a huge meeting.
- Hey, have a great first day back.
- I hate you.
I'll call you.
Oh, you're such a lawyer.
Sorry.
Didn't want to sneak in unnoticed.
Mission accomplished.
Hi!
Can I help you with something?
Is that your boat in slip 41?
It is now.
It was my dad's, Terry Reed.
Did you know him?
- My wife and I, we're new here.
- Oh, yeah?
Sorry.
Well, even if you weren't, you know, he didn't sail it very often.
If you don't wanna give people a wrong impression, you really should change the name.
What's the bad luck to change the boat's name?
Bitch.
- Did you just call me...?
- Anyway, I like it.
You know, it was my idea.
He was lonely, and then he met somebody, and then the boat was lonely.
So...
Anyway, have a good day!
Welcome aboard.
Hey, Spencer.
Lauren's been trying to call you all morning.
Really?
I just turned my phone on.
Kate, if she's called me, she's probably called you at least 10 times.
You know, what if there is an emergency?
I'm a mediator, I don't have emergencies.
At least, not professionally.
Look, she's calling me again on the other line.
Could you, please, call her back?
She's a bit obsessive, our stepmother, don't you think?
That's what dad loved.
- I thought it was her ass.
- That, too.
I'll just give her some time.
It's only been a week.
Now, what about you?
Are you sure about going back to work already?
Well, I kinda owe it to dad.
You know, it's his firm, but it's your life.
Yeah, but those things are really connected.
Look, I gotta go to Debbie's crime.
Good luck today.
- All right.
- Don't forget to call Lauren.
- Oh, you know me.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Coffee, black, please.
- Sure.
- Gimme the money.
- Okay.
Gimme the money!
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on!
Screw you, pal!
Screw me?
Screw you!
Okay.
Hold on a second.
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.
Just put the gun down, 'cause you don't wanna hurt anybody, all right?
How's that coffee comin' along?
Um...
You seem like the kinda guy who knows what he's doing.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, so, uh...
We're not gonna have any problems here, right?
Yeah.
No.
Right.
Okay, good.
So just tuck the gun back under your shirt, 'cause you don't want someone to walk by, and then they see you and...
Right?
How we doing on that coffee?
Good.
Now, educate me.
What do you get when you rob a store?
You...
You know, money.
Right.
How much?
Gimme a number.
- 500 bucks?
- Yeah, right!
5...
Forget it, man!
Let's just say 100.
All right?
You get shot...
The emergency room is gonna cost you a grand.
So just give the guy 100 bucks.
- I'm gonna give him something.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.
What are you gonna buy with the money?
Beer.
And, uh... beef jerky.
Beer and jerky.
Nice.
That's a balanced meal.
So how much does...
Let's say 50 bucks of beer and jerky cost you?
- 17.50.
- 7... 17.50?
Are you kidding me?
- Who's robbing who?
- Hey, come on!
All right, fine, fine, fine.
So how does 50 bucks of beer and jerky sound to you?
I mean, I assume you're gonna be running, right?
- So that's all you can carry.
- That's...
Yeah, okay.
Okay, good.
So... 17.50 wholesale...
And we go on with our day.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
And my coffee, right?
You're gonna get my coffee.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.
Okay, good.
Black.
Okay.
There you go.
And, uh...
How 'bout this?
Good.
Okay?
- Ha ha!
- All right.
You're welcome.
Hey, hey, hey, that... that's 5.75.
For coffee and a cookie?
Those are organic.
- Spencer.
- Did you call Lauren?
- Nope.
I got held up.
- Kate...
- Gotta go.
Love you!
- Kate!
Ah...
Leo, my Leo.
Good morning.
Welcome back.
You look great.
Oh, what can I say?
Grief suits me.
Yeah.
Oh, you should try this.
It's apple chai tea infusion.
Eew.
I hate those girly drinks, Leo.
Your loss.
It's appletastic.
Uh, Judge Nicastro's office called.
You're expected in his court at 11:30.
- He's got a case for you.
- Doesn't Judge Nicastro know
I'm not a practicing attorney anymore?
It's a mediation.
You were specifically requested.
Okay, that's weird.
He hates me.
Yes.
Yes, he does.
You're supposed to say, "No, he doesn't, he loves you."
- Any other calls?
- Lauren.
That bitch just can't help herself.
- I mean, it's my first day back.
- Kate.
My father is not even cold in the ground.
- We can't all be obsessive-compulsive...
- Kate!
- Anal retentive...
- Ah!
She's right behind me, isn't she?
Kate.
I need you.
Now.
Yes.
Right.
I was just going over my schedule here with Leonardo.
- You need me back...
- ASAP.
S-a-p.
You have a tendency to panic.
You have a tendency not to.
Um, now that dad's gone, are you still my evil stepmother or just the evil managing partner?
Have you been to Masa's lately?
- What?
- Boulevard.
Aqua.
Gary Danko.
No.
I haven't done much dining out lately.
I've been mourning the death of my father.
You?
Hey.
I miss my husband.
Every minute.
But instead of sulking,
I am trying to protect the firm he loved.
By running up your expense account?
Oh, grow up, Kate.
Every law firm in San Francisco is wining and dining our clients, telling them to jump ship...
and it's working.
Ortho West left for Morrison Foerster, the Rixton Group for Wilson Sonsini, and Tinker Connelly, Third Pallbearer, right side, dropped us the day...
Of the funeral.
I called his son from the limo and over drinks at the Morgan tonight,
I will get that business back.
Teddy Reed is dead.
Reed Reed is on life support.
I will do whatever it takes to keep it alive.
What can I do?
You know Charles and Douglas Pease.
Yeah, sure.
Pease, inc.
Women's clothing.
They're a big client.
Well, as you know, they've agreed to be bought out by a Canadian company.
Douglas will be in charge.
His father retires with a generous severance.
So what's the problem?
Well, they were supposed to sign the contracts today, but the old man called me this morning and tried to back out.
No deal for them, no fees for us.
Now, I convinced Charles to come in and talk it out with Douglas, but we need those contracts signed.
Get them on the same page.
That's what I do.
Pastels.
Primaries.
Stripes.
Solids.
- You have no idea, do you?
- That's not the point, is it?
- Gentlemen...
- You don't know what to think unless somebody graphs it for you.
- Gentlemen...
- Are you gonna run the company?
No.
You're gonna let bean counters...
Gentlemen...
You know Kate Reed.
Hey, Charlie, Doug.
I'm sorry about your father.
He was a good man.
I'll miss him.
Thank you.
- I'll miss him too.
- Thank you so much, Doug.
That's my boy.
Never an original thought.
Since we seem to be at an impasse,
I thought it might be helpful if Kate got involved.
We don't need a mediator.
Thanks anyway, Kate.
- I've made my decision.
- Right.
I've heard.
It took 14 months to put this deal together.
He was with it every step of the way.
This is his deal, and he won't sign it.
Well, he doesn't have to if he doesn't want to.
- That's not...
- But...
Do you mind just telling me,
Charlie, because this is so not like you:
What's the story?
Where's your head at?
Spring 1993.
I ordered Capri pants.
Everyone else... the Gap, the Limited...
They're all thinking bells.
I cleaned their clocks.
All of them.
That was a fantastic time, Charles.
What has that got to do with...
The business is not in your blood.
You don't feel it.
I built the company on instinct, intuition.
And that's your strength, Charlie.
And I'm sure that Doug has his own.
I have my MBA from Stanford.
I make decisions based on statistical analysis,
- trend-spotting.
- Pie charts.
We've had ten consecutive losing quarters.
We blame the economy, and so far everyone believes us.
But it's been a long time, dad,
- since you've cleaned anyone's clock.
- Okay okay, clearly you two approach things differently, but here's the part that I don't understand.
That was true 14 months ago when you started negotiating this buyout.
It was true a week ago, and it was true yesterday.
So what changed?
- Tell her about last night.
- It has nothing to do with...
- It's about judgment, Douglas.
- Please, dad.
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, Charlie.
What happened?
I was coming home from dinner with clients.
I was on the 280 heading south.
I'd just got on the bridge.
A red sedan crossed over the line and bumped me.
What the hell?
Whatcha gonna say now?
Whatcha gotta say?
I don't remember the impact.
It was instinct, you know, turning away from the gun.
I didn't...
See them at all.
- It just happened so fast.
- Did anyone I.D. the sedan?
Well, a good samaritan called it in, and there's a second witness.
The driver and gunman are in custody.
Now, if we go through this buyout...
We have to disclose the details of any pending legal action.
Well, someone pointed a gun at him.
- He's blameless.
- He was drunk.
Douglas had a blood alcohol level that was elevated.
- .09.
- Drunk.
I had two glasses of wine.
That's not why I crashed.
The courts aren't gonna see it that way.
- Of course they're not.
- And that's exactly why you don't want this to go to court.
So how do we put these thugs in jail and clean up Doug's mess?
Charlie, I was an attorney for five years.
I quit to become a mediator.
You wanna know why?
In court, somebody wins, but there's always a loser.
And it doesn't necessarily have to do with who's right and who's wrong.
Now, if we go to court, this is gonna limp through the system for 18 months and all the while, Doug's DUI is gonna become public record, which is exactly what you don't want.
I'm not just gonna stand by and do nothing.
Okay, the kids in the car...
that's an open and shut case.
The system's gonna take care of them.
They'll probably be offered some kind of plea bargain.
Our only concern is Doug's DUI.
We handle that, the deal can move forward, right?
Absolutely.
Charles?
Great.
So we're all back on the same page.
Win-win.
And you know what?
Kate has a unique connection to the D.A.'S office.
I am sure she'd be happy to use it.
Especially for such important clients like you.
Lauren, may I have a word with you, please?
Excuse us, gentlemen.
My father would never ask me to do this.
No, you're right.
He wouldn't.
He'd ask me to ask you.
It's business, Kate.
We use what we have.
Our clients can go anywhere for legal services.
Hell, they can get half of what they need off the Internet.
They come to us for our connections.
You have one.
We're using it.
Just do something with my father's ashes.
- Coffee.
Black, three sugars.
- You're forgiven.
- Where ya goin'?
- Hell.
He wasn't driving erratically or over the speed limit.
In fact, the legality of a sobriety test, given the circumstances, is questionable at best.
- You missed me.
- That's not why I'm here.
Well, you could have called.
- Lauren asked me to...
- Yeah, I know.
But you could have called.
Instead, you came over.
Because it's important.
Because you feel guilty about last night.
Why would I feel guilty about last night?
Oh, you're saying you're not here because you feel guilty?
Yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
- So you miss me.
- You're such a dick.
All right.
You're gonna like this.
Your gunman's got an extensive record.
Pointing a firearm at another driver from a moving vehicle's a class a felony.
- He's gonna do ten years.
- Can I see?
No, no, no.
Ha.
Attorneys only.
Sorry.
The driver's also looking at ten reducible to five.
Well, those are stiff sentences.
- My client will be happy.
- Pretty standard stuff, actually.
There's the possibility of catastrophic loss of life.
The vehicle itself is a weapon.
The gun compounds the threat.
The law was designed to keep gangbangers from taking their beefs on the road.
And what about my guy's DUI?
Well...
He's got no priors.
Given the circumstances, a good lawyer should get it thrown out.
Let's assume he has a good lawyer.
Ha.
Cute.
Okay.
We're done.
This wasn't just business, was it, huh?
Come on, be honest, Kate.
This was about us.
Justin...
I'm always honest.
It's my greatest flaw.
Well, it's one of them.
Yeah.
Remind me again why our marriage didn't work.
Ah.
Just did.
I was joking, Kate.
I was kidding.
Kate.
I was kidding.
Wait.
Okay, I get it.
You're angry.
I'm sorry.
This looks familiar.
I apologize.
- Not accepted.
Nope.
- I'm sorry, Kate.
I apologize.
Really familiar.
Could you get her on the phone, please?
Talk to me, Leo.
Hey, don't be late for Judge Nicastro.
- He hates to be kept waiting.
- Oh, give me a little credit.
We'll get right outside of his courtroom.
Taxi!
[]
Sorry!
I'm sorry.
Judge, I am so sorry.
Really sorry about this.
No, you're not.
You're Kate Reed.
You have nothing but disdain for the law.
Okay, well, that's not entirely true, sir.
- You quit the profession.
- I'm still in the system.
It's just a...
different part.
Ha ha.
- Mr. Brian Michaels...
- Yes, sir.
Is suing the three parties involved in his meticulously planned marriage proposal.
The proposal went awry, and his grandmother's wedding ring, appraised at $11,500, was lost.
So Mr. Michaels is requesting of one unemployed actor, one singing waiter, and one cupcake maker...
Damages totaling... $10 million.
Really, Mr. Michaels?
Yeah.
I just want what's fair.
- So do we, your honor!
- Your honor, I have...
Now, as much as I would love to have this case in my courtroom,
I thought that it might be better served elsewhere.
So...
Sit down.
So we're going to try something a little different...
Alternative dispute resolution, also known as mediation.
Bailiff.
- Kate Reed is not...
- Thanks.
A lawyer.
She is a mediator.
A mediator is kind of a referee in a game with no rules, except those agreed to by the parties involved.
Ms. Reed handles all sorts of disputes, some even bigger than yours.
Earlier this year, she was called in by the United Nations to settle a border dispute between Colombia and...
Paraguay.
Colombia and Nicaragua, sir.
And it was their embassies here in San Francisco.
They border each other on Market Street, and they share a common wall.
But the U.N. did call.
- They did call.
- Ms. Reed.
- Yes, sir.
- Find a way to keep this case out of my court.
- Okay.
- You've got two days.
Two days?
Judge...
There are three defendants, and this guy's asking for $10 million.
Two days doesn't seem exactly...
Okay.
How about tomorrow morning at 9:00?
Would you like to try for later on this afternoon?
- No.
- Find a resolution or you will be sent to prison for contempt of court.
Yes, I can do that.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Bailiff, call the next case.
Kate Reed's office.
Judge Nicastro really does hate me.
No, he doesn't.
He loves you.
That's right.
I forgot.
Okay, so why does he hate me?
Well... there's the Fineman debacle.
- Yes.
Right.
- And the examiner interview.
- Okay.
That was bad.
- And the joke you made about his wife and the horse that his wife overheard.
So you're saying it's not random.
Oh.
I never said that.
I like you more every day, Leo.
Okay, um...
The complainants that Nicastro dumped on me will be there at 2:00, so...
Set 'em up for me in the conference room.
Done.
What about the Pease case?
Solved.
I'm amazing.
I'll be back in 20.
Next.
Hey.
Wake up.
- Where is he?
- Out.
- Lunch.
- That son of a bitch!
- Did you not read the file?
- Which file, Kate?
The file you couldn't possibly have read because I didn't give it to you?
The file that would be illegal for you to have in your possession.
Justin, Justin, the driver!
The driver!
Look, I'm in a meeting, Kate.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Sorry.
Hi...
- How'd you know where I was?
- It's Monday.
He'll have a polish with onions and a peach Snapple.
- This kid is going to Yale.
- I'm sorry.
Isn't this the same kid you just asked me to put in jail?
Yeah.
But that was before I knew the full story.
Thank you.
- Justin.
Don't do this!
- It's my heart.
- You don't have a heart!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- God!
Read the damn file!
- Hey, I wrote the file!
And if you read it, that's a crime.
I'm gonna go talk to those kids.
Taxi!
Go ahead.
What do you think they're gonna say, huh?
They're gonna say what they always say... "I'm innocent."
I did you a favor.
You asked me to do this.
Certain things have been put in motion...
Hey, Kate!
Sir, can you put your arms out?
Thank you.
- I'm guilty.
- You realize that means...
- I'll do the time.
- D'Sean, this is a class "A" felony.
Nah.
Gun wasn't loaded.
It doesn't matter if the gun was chocolate.
You were in a moving vehicle.
You threatened another driver.
The D.A.'S gonna offer you ten years.
I woulda pulled the trigger if I knew that.
And ten years for Nathan.
Well.
He might only have to do five.
For what?
He was driving.
He's an accessory.
No...
Nathan didn't do nothing, he... my cousin...
- My cousin, he's...
- I know, but listen to me.
- He's clean.
- Listen to me.
- It doesn't work like that.
- Let me do his time.
He doesn't have to go down for what I did.
The courts are not gonna let you do that.
Give it to me!
He didn't do nothin'!
He didn't do nothin'!
He didn't do nothin'!
Say it!
Say he's innocent!
He didn't do nothin'!
He's innocent!
That's my homie!
You wanna take him away?
That's my boy!
"National Honor Society.
"Big Brother.
All-State Marching Band."
Wow.
You're an impressive kid, Nathan.
Tell me what happened.
We were heading home.
Just...
Driving.
Listening to the radio.
And all of a sudden...
Ha ha ha... yeah, whatever.
What's up?
Don't y'all know how to drive?
What are you doing, man?
He took his piece out.
- You don't know how to drive?
- Yo, D'Sean!
- Yo, man...
Yo, relax!
- It's on, man!
No!
We gonna get pinched!
He wasn't gonna shoot or anything, he just...
That's just D'Sean.
- Chill!
It's all right!
- No, man!
The lady in the car, she saw the gun, I think, and freaked.
You said there was a woman driving the car?
- Yes.
- Did you see a man in the passenger seat or in the back?
I barely saw her.
Okay.
Why did D'Sean have a gun?
Everyone I know's got a gun.
'cept me.
I'm the good boy.
So what kind of time am I facing?
Ten years.
Five if you plea out of it.
Or you could insist that you go to trial.
Um, you've got no priors.
Roll the dice.
Take my chances?
Well...
Yeah.
From the ghetto to Yale.
Just that right there...
Getting in.
I think I used up all my luck.
I don't believe that.
And you shouldn't either.
Why not?
There was definitely a woman driving the car?
Definitely.
Okay.
You've still got some luck left.
It's black and white, Kate.
Nothing is ever black and white.
The guy had a woman in the car.
That... that's not a crime.
The kids... they pulled a gun.
- That is.
- One.
One kid pulled a gun.
- There's no legal distinction.
- Okay.
But there should be.
What does any of this have to do with your mediation?
Why would Doug lie?
Why would he cop to a DUI when he wasn't even driving?
Because if a guy's gonna lie about anything, it's gonna be about a woman.
Your Doug would rather face a judge than face his wife.
Speaking of...
When's yours coming back?
- Terry's up in Seattle.
- Uh-huh.
Pitching a new account.
But coming back tonight...
For date night.
- Yeah, date night!
- Ooh!
- Ooh.
- Special.
- You got that?
- I thought you hated it
- when dad worked all the time.
- I did.
That's why I quit the firm.
Lila's gonna know her father.
Well, that's good.
At least she'll know one of her parents.
So...
Good work there, dad.
Did you come here to tell me that my marriage sucks?
- No, no, no, I...
- But you think it does.
Look, I just...
I think it's different than what you said you wanted.
I thought mediators were supposed to solve problems.
Sometimes.
And then...
Sometimes they just like to point 'em out, you know...
No charge.
♪ If I were king of the forest ♪
- I don't believe you.
- Talk to me, Leo.
The people from Judge Nicastro's court are waiting for you in the conference room.
- Ooh, God damn it.
Oh...
- Nice.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Oh...
Aunt Katie's got a potty mouth!
Uh...
I gotta go.
I love you.
Bye.
- Love ya.
- I'll call you later.
All right.
Leo, something's not right with this Pease thing.
I need to head over there first.
But what about the people in the conference room?
Yeah.
Just tell them I'm running late.
- Oh, no!
Wait, wait!
- Okay.
Soon as my hearing comes back.
Wait!
Wait!
Please!
Ah!
Uh, taxi!
- Totally obsessive!
- O-oh, obsessive?
Y-you were drunk!
Ms. Reed's running late.
- You guys need anything?
- Boom!
I'd like to hear you say, Brian...
You were crying!
So you're all good then.
Okay, then.
I've got some good news and some better news.
I'm comin' in.
All right, well, I talked to the D.A.
The government's looking at ten years, and there is no interest in pursuing Doug's DUI.
Terrific.
That's everything.
I believe it is, yes.
What about the other punk, the driver?
Well, here's the thing.
There's two versions of the accident.
Wrong.
There was one accident.
Two parties involved.
One party of criminals, the other my son.
That's one version.
Do you know who was in the car?
Yeah.
Scumbag one and scumbag two.
D'Sean has a record, but Nathan the driver doesn't.
In fact, he's quite the model citizen.
He's got a full scholarship to Yale.
- He starts in the fall.
- Not anymore.
Nathan Henry's a good kid, Charles... he's smart.
Smart kids choose smart friends, not gun-carrying gangsters.
Well, maybe in the suburbs.
If Douglas grew up in Hunter's Point, he'd have friends with guns.
Oh, please.
I'm sick of hearing about how getting spanked when you were four gives you license to rob a grocery store when you're 40.
It's an excuse, and I don't buy it.
It is easy to be judgmental when you grow up with wealth.
The children of privilege aren't allowed to fail.
- It's not their fault.
- No, it's not their fault.
- That's right... exactly right.
- So whose fault is it that when you grow up in a lousy neighborhood you study your ass off to make straight A's, you get the crap kicked out of you for not being in a gang?
I grew up poor.
I'm not a criminal.
Neither is Nathan Henry.
He not only survived and stayed clean...
He got a full scholarship to Yale.
Now, the gunman, he'll do his time.
He knows it's coming.
But you've gotta let Nathan off the hook.
You lack your father's clarity.
It troubles me.
It troubled him, too, sir.
Dad, maybe we're pushing a little too hard on this.
Does it...
Really matter if this Nathan goes to jail?
Yes.
Again, Douglas, judgment.
- Let's not lose sight of...
- When I asked if you knew who was in the car, I was talking about Doug's.
There was a woman driving his car.
Both boys saw her, and in the police report, a woman's purse was found on the floor.
Now, I don't suppose that your wife ran from the scene of an accident.
Carol-Anne was in L.A.
I'm sure she was.
No I.D. in the purse.
Cheap makeup.
Was she a rental?
Uh, I met her in the bar at the restaurant.
Oh!
What?
What?
Oh, yeah, wake up!
She had a room at a hotel nearby.
Never made it there, tough.
What was her name?
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't even know her name, and you let her drive the Beemer?
That's the part that bothers you?
You pick up hookers a lot?
Well...
What's a lot?
Jesus, Douglas.
What's the point of all this?
Well, facts change.
Positions should too.
Everything's not so black and white.
All right, gentlemen,
I, uh, have another meeting to go to.
I'm gonna let you two talk.
Call me later...
And we'll wrap this up.
$10 million!
Do you know how much of a waste of time this is for me right now?
Oh, hey, I need Kate.
Oh, you know what?
She is busy.
She's got a court-ordered mediation.
All right, well, tell her I'm looking for her.
You know I will.
Leonardo!
Leo!
Hey.
Come here.
You know I would never ask you to do anything that comes even close to the border of illegality.
- Oh, I know.
- And I'm not asking you now.
Especially from your Dungeons Dragons buddies over at the police department or the DMV.
You've not asked me many times before.
Exactly.
This is just like one of those times.
The license plate number for Doug Pease's car.
Find out everything you can about him, the car, the night of the accident...
everything.
Why?
What are you...
What are you looking for?
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem right yet.
- Okay, then.
- Yeah.
Conference room.
I read their file.
What do you think, like...
An hour?
Ugh.
Dinner and a pillow.
Ooh.
Fun.
Ha.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Kate Reed, and I will be your mediator today.
- Hi, Kate.
- Can you please talk
- to that idiot?
- These morons...
- I gotta get out of here.
- A million doll...
Better.
Thank you.
Okay, uh...
Brian Michaels, you wanted to make a memorable wedding proposal to your girlfriend.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Quite a complicated plan.
- Actually, it was very simple.
Oh, please!
- Yeah, like d-day.
- Psycho!
Jessica and I ordered a cable car, which is where we met three years ago.
I hired three people, each one representing one year in our dating history, to board the cable car at three consecutive stops...
The first to read my first love letter to Jessica.
The second to sing, Time of My Life.
And one was to present us with cupcakes with our faces in the icing.
- Oh, that's sweet.
- I know.
- Okay, so what happened?
- Well, the actor was drunk, the singing was terrible, and the cupcakes...
They looked nothing like us!
I wasn't drunk.
I had vertigo.
- I have talent!
- It doesn't matter.
I proposed anyway.
All right?
I presented Jessica with my grandmother's engagement ring.
She'd given me her father's watch.
He passed away last year.
He loved Brian.
I wanted to give her something just as special.
But their incompetence made us lose the ring.
- We never lost anything.
- You were going crazy!
- He attacked me.
- You murdered our song!
Don't make me...
Whistle again...
Please.
She dropped the ring.
I may have been technically drunk but...
- It's not my fault.
- Well, then whose fault is it?
- Yours!
- All right, Jessica,
Brian proposed.
He gave you the ring.
And then what happened?
Well, I was about to put it on, and then everyone started yelling and someone was trying to pass me, and the cupcake with Brian's face fell in this woman's lap and she screamed, and it...
It was gone, it was just gone.
There was nothing that you could do about it?
No!
I mean, you could have held on to it.
Oh!
I-I'm not saying it's your fault.
- Okay.
What are you saying?
- N-nothing.
I mean, I-I'm saying it could have happened to anyone.
- It's like you said.
- Exactly.
Could it have happened to you, Brian?
No.
I would have held on to it.
Oh, my God, you really do think it's my fault!
I didn't say that.
Actually, you did.
That's not what I meant!
- Okay, what'd you mean?
- N-nothing.
I just... oh, forget it.
I...
I-it's just it's really hard for me to understand.
That's all.
I mean, I would never lose your father's watch.
It's too important to me.
You think I lost the ring because I don't care about it?
That's... eh...
All right.
I'm gonna send you folks home.
- Yes!
- Okay?
So just be in court
- tomorrow morning at 9:00.
- 9:00?
I'm not even awake.
Actually, you know, I'd like to stay
- and watch this for a bit.
- Yeah.
No.
He's got some...issues.
Let's just get this all out right now.
Harrington.
Beware the one who whispers in the night.
He stokes the fire that never dies...
Oh.
Thanks.
Appreciate that.
And walks the endless circle.
What filthy creature of the night dares call by day?
Hey, it's Leonardo.
I need some information.
Open.
Close.
Open.
Close.
It's easy now.
- Open...
Close.
- In here.
Without my maniac fianceé screaming at me and people there freaking out!
It's one hand on the rail, one on the ring.
My leg is free.
Nobody's getting near this!
Nobody!
All right!
I think we got it all out, right?
Most of it.
A lot of it.
Let's just take a break.
Ooh.
Hot date?
Hmph.
Tim Connelly.
Yikes.
Once again, glad I'm not you.
I just got off a call with Charles Pease.
Thought you had everything handled.
- He's calling off the deal.
- But that's absurd, because when I left their office earlier...
You met with Charles and Douglas without me?
Yes.
Well, I-I got some information about the accident.
See, the boy driving the other car...
- Wait.
He's not our client.
- I know that.
But the boy driving the other car is innocent.
But he's not our client.
Aw, Kate...
I call you in to help, and now I've got to clean up your mess.
Wow, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I-I should never let an innocent kid's life stand in the way of our legal fees.
You know, is it me you hate?
Or lawyers in general?
Maybe it's the fact that I married your beloved father.
You know what?
He was beloved to me too.
My father was a lawyer.
My ex-husband is a lawyer.
My brother is a lawyer, and I was a lawyer.
And even though I carry around more than a small amount of self-hatred, if I really hated lawyers, I wouldn't work at a law firm.
And as for marrying my father, yes...
I hate you for that.
I thought my mother made him happy...
Until I saw him with you.
And I don't know what to think about that.
So I hate you.
It's simpler that way.
Is that you, the dwarf?
I'm the gnome.
In wintergrasp.
- Well, what is he doing?
- Defending the keep.
- It looks like he's attacking.
- I'm taking out the towers.
Even when you're playing defense, you've got to attack.
- Interesting.
- Mm-hmm.
Focus on the wrong thing, you get killed.
- I have learned much from you.
- Well, I am the master.
And you've taught me well.
Anything on Doug's car?
Not yet.
Okay.
Go home.
How's it going with the loving couple?
Good.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I feel a breakthrough coming.
Well, I-I'll stick around.
Still got some, uh, work...
To do.
Okay.
You didn't see that coming at all, did ya?
That it was her brother, right?
Oh...
I did not, no.
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
Oh, no, no, no, Tim, I am done.
I have another meeting.
I don't think you do.
You're so funny.
Oh...
Ha.
I get that a lot.
What do you want?
Oh.
It's...
Gratifying to know that I have your company's support.
Reed Reed will continue to provide the level of service...
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Look...
I'm easy, okay?
You guys do good work.
I got no complaints.
The old man was just trying to shake ya down for a better rate, the prick.
Don't worry...
I'm not gonna let him pull our business away.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate the loyalty, and you can be sure
I will go the extra mile to make sure you're happy.
What's that?
Extra mile.
Actually, it's more like an extra couple of floors.
I told ya I was easy.
- Thank you both.
- Our pleasure.
Oh, Tim...
I think we, uh...
Overindulged.
Thank you so much for the business.
Good night.
What, am I too young for you, Lauren?
You'd rather have drinks with my dad?
Hey, Lauren, I want my extra mile, okay?
Can I see your watch?
My watch?
Hmm-hmm.
The one Jessica gave you, her father's watch.
You know what, Brian?
I don't think you're ever gonna forgive Jessica for letting go of your grandmother's ring.
It's kinda hard to understand.
I'm just saying.
So...
The only way for you to get past this is to destroy something important to Jessica.
- Smash the watch.
- What?
- No!
- It's the only way.
And then you'll be even.
- Y-you're crazy.
- Brian.
- It's the only way.
- Brian, no!
- I-I won't do it.
- Oh, come on, do it.
- No!
- Just smash it.
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not gonna smash the watch.
- Smash the watch.
- No.
It was her father's watch.
She gave me the watch.
It's too important, I'm not...
- Aah!
- Oh...
Oh!
Oh, my God, I can't believe you just did that.
I'm so sorry!
What kind of mediator are you?
I loved that watch.
I loved how special it was to you that you wanted me to have it.
But that's how I felt about the ring.
Brian, I was devastated.
I'm sorry I made you feel worse on top of that.
Sorry that I made you feel the way that I do now.
I feel...
Oh, my God.
It's just a watch.
It's just a ring.
They're symbols.
We have the real thing.
I love you, Jessica.
- You, I hate.
- Ditto.
Oh...
Buffy the vampire slayer.
Wrong watch.
Sleight of hand.
It's easy to lose sight of what's important.
You focus on the wrong thing, you get killed.
I stopped breathing for a while.
No, don't do that.
Don't ever do that.
Brian, are you dropping the charges and moving on?
Moving on.
Excellent.
I'll see you in court tomorrow.
I'm awake.
And that's not funny.
Go home.
I haven't heard anything about the car.
It's okay.
Maybe tomorrow.
Definitely.
All right.
- I'm going.
- Okay.
- Oh, Leo?
- Yep.
Uh, you know that
Buffy the vampire slayer watch you have?
- Yeah.
- Well, I wanted to get one for a friend.
Where'd you get it, like Toys R Us?
Oh, no.
That's one of only three inscribed by Sarah Michelle Geller herself to commemorate the 100th episode.
That's why I keep it locked in the desk drawer.
Oh.
Okay.
Uh...
Well, I guess I'll just have to track down one of the other ones then.
Good luck with that.
It's gonna cost you a fortune.
He's worth it.
Hi, dad.
It's late.
- Yes.
- You home?
No.
You?
What do you think?
Tomorrow morning Nathan's public defender is gonna recommend that he cop a plea.
Why?
He didn't do anything.
I'll offer five years, and he'll take it.
- It's a good deal.
- It's a death sentence, Justin.
Look, I did what you asked, Kate.
He's not going to trial.
You're welcome, by the way.
For what?
He's going to jail.
Yeah.
Could have been worse.
This thing gets in front of a judge,
- the law says a weapon...
- The law, the law, the law!
God, what about the boy whose life is gonna be ruined?
Does he even matter in this?
Go you're just like my dad, you know that?
You make these laws up, and then you hold them up like they're sacred or something, like they're from God, like there's nothing higher.
But guess what, Justin.
There is.
There is justice and there is truth.
And who gets to decide what's true... you?
Five years, Kate.
It's a good deal.
For who?
You know what would be a perfect wedding?
- To elope?
- You're kidding, right?
Because I've already done the seating chart.
It's alphabetized and everything.
Your uncle asked to sit...
It's very late.
Tomorrow Nathan Henry's gonna accept a deal that sends him to prison for five years.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Sorry is meaningless, Doug.
Call the D.A.
He has discretion with the sentence.
Tell him that you don't want Nathan charged.
My father...
Your father doesn't make any sense.
You were in the car.
This is your decision.
I can't.
Why?
It looks like I've lost the job I wanted.
If I go against him, I'll lose him, and if I lose him, I lose the job that I have now.
I lose my house.
I lose...
Everything.
Oh, Doug...
Please.
This is so much bigger than you.
Stand up for Nathan.
Save his life.
Do the right thing.
I envy you.
You always seem to know what that is.
You've reached the cell phone of Teddy Reed.
I'm not currently available.
Leave a message, and I will return your call promptly.
Thank you.
I'll take it to her.
It's mine.
Sorry.
Uh...
You want me to toss it back?
No, hold on to it.
I'll come by tonight and pick it up.
Oh, will you?
I'm Andrew, by the way.
Kate.
Kate, I'm taking the boat out.
Sailing under the bridge.
Wanna come out for a sail?
God, you know what, that just sounds like a great idea.
But, uh, I've got this little thing called a job, you know?
Actually, I don't.
Mm.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Hold on.
Hey!
It was a messenger.
He... he said it was important.
- I was just...
- Psh, psh, psh... this is amazing.
This is epic.
Thank you so much.
This is exactly what I wanted!
Um...
I gotta go.
I can't be late.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You have a fantastic day!
Leo, I've got the picture.
Oh, my God...
Okay.
Uh...
Nathan's supposed to make his plea today, so tell Doug Pease I'm coming over right after court.
Judge Nicastro.
Good news.
Great news!
Mr. Michaels is dropping the lawsuit, and further, he agrees to drop all future lawsuits regarding the failed engagement plans and the loss of his grandmother's ring.
Mr. Michaels, is that true?
- Yes.
- Yes!
As long as I can still sue if something goes wrong with the wedding.
We're gonna have a hot air balloon dropping rose petals...
Enough?
Okay?
You're driving yourself crazy.
- Makin' me crazy.
- I just want the wedding to be everything that the proposal wasn't, you know, unexpected and surprising.
Me too.
Why don't we just get married right now?
W-eh... here?
I mean, why not?
We have everything we need.
We have witnesses and a judge.
I mean, come on!
- Are you surprised?
- Y-yeah!
It's unexpected.
I didn't expect it.
Brian, now or never.
- Now.
- Judge.
By the power vested in me by the State of California,
I now pronounce you man and wife.
- That's it?
- There's some paperwork.
Yay!
Okay.
Picture time.
Smile.
Aw!
Congratulations!
- Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome.
When I have any future conflicts, can I... 15-minute recess.
Newlyweds, meet me in my chambers.
I'm gonna need some signatures, and then you can begin your lifetime of happiness.
- You three are free to go.
- Whoo!
Ha ha!
Thank you.
I really love my watch.
- Later.
- Bye.
Bailiff, take Ms. Reed into custody.
What?
Why?
Because I took a picture?
You were four minutes late.
God.
Everything's a technicality.
- I hate courts.
- I know you do.
Wait, wait, you can't be serious about this.
I mean, does justice look like this?
I knew you'd recognize it when you saw it.
What?
Hold on!

Leo.
Hey, are the new contracts in?
They're being messengered over to the Pease building.
Lauren's on her way to see Charles, and Douglas is expecting you.
- Are you almost there?
- I'm walking into the lobby.
Sure, you are.
Hello!
Hello!
Excuse me!
Sir!
Somebody!
Oh!
Justin!
Justin!
Hey!
Hi!
Did you get the message I left?
Yes.
And I moved Nathan's plea to the end of the day.
Oh!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- I really gotta run.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait...
Hold on.
I need a teeny, tiny favor.
Justin!
Is there something specific that's bothering you?
I-is there a deal point that can be improved on?
Maybe the share valuation.
It's just not going to happen, Lauren.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
Please, I just have a couple more thoughts.
Put them in an email.
I'll do that.
We need to look past the third quarter.
Doug!
Doug, hey.
...Can we... can we talk in private?
- No.
- No?
Okay.
Well...
It's amazing technology, these photo cameras.
Uh, go on ahead.
Crystal clear picture, don't you think?
Yep.
What do you want?
I want you to do the right thing.
I'll be in your father's office.
- Kate!
- Excuse me.
What do you want?
I want what I've always wanted, what's best for you, what's best for Doug, and what's best for Nathan Henry.
That young man is not my concern.
No, he's mine.
I was driving.
It's my decision.
I'm gonna ask to have the charges dropped.
I'll let the D.A. know that he'll be hearing from you this morning.
W-what are you doing?
Why are you here?
- Our business is done.
- No, it's not.
Don't contradict me, young lady.
Oh, I always finish what I start, Charlie.
My father taught me that.
He taught me a lotta things.
I'm sure he tried, but I doubt you were really listening.
God, you're just like my dad!
My gosh.
You don't wanna retire because you're afraid you're gonna disappear, but...
Oh, save the psychobabble...
You keep trying to hold on so tightly, Charles, that that's exactly what's gonna happen.
You will disappear, because when you die, everything you know will die with you.
But it doesn't have to.
It can live on.
Is this your way of pushing me out?
- Is this all your idea?
- No.
Douglas's idea is that you stay on as chairman.
Oh, I-I think that is an idea with some merit.
- So now you're on her side.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm on your company's side, Charles, always.
Douglas runs the company as president, and you keep an eye on the big picture.
You mentor him.
You pass down what you know.
That way, you'll have a legacy.
And it'll be around even when you're not.
Douglas has his own ideas.
He doesn't wanna listen to mine...
He never did.
I can try.
You're gonna make me read those damn pie charts, aren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
It's a smart move, Charles.
If I see the word emeritus or acting next to chairman,
- the deal's off.
- No, you'll be the real chairman, dad.
- That's right!
- Charlie.
Are you and Doug on the same page now?
Excellent.
Great.
Well, we'll need to amend the deals.
- I'll have our contractor...
- Hold, please.
I took the liberty.
New contracts.
Now, gentlemen...
If you will...
Just... initial at the Xs.
Have you started thinking about next year's summer line?
- Yeah.
A little.
- A little is not good enough.
- We need designs by next month.
- I know.
We'll have them.
A little.
Nice work, boys.
Great.
Well.
Look at that.
Win-win.
You blindsided me.
I got the job done.
- How?
- Trade secret.
No.
I don't think so.
There was no woman in the car.
See, everyone was telling the truth.
There was a woman driving...
And Doug was the only person in the car.
- Hey, yo!
- What the hell?
- You don't know how to drive?
- Oh, God!
Ah!
Yo, put the piece away, man!
Yeah, that's right!
Oh, my...
Why can't you use your desk?
No privacy.
Didn't think you were coming in.
Ohh.
Yeah.
Me neither.
Leo, have you been working out?
Let's not play that charade today.
What?
I gave up my Planeswalkers to get that picture.
Dungeons Dragons?
- It's magic cards.
- Magic cards.
Planeswalkers...
Travel through planes of existence.
And they're very hard to get.
Interesting.
Just...
Just say thank you.
Is that a new sweater vest?
You never say thank you.
That's not true.
Thank you.
Kate.
Hey, Lauren.
What?
You wanna give me a raise?
Oh!
No, you are willing to admit that lawyers burn bridges and mediators build them.
You wanna congratulate me on turning the Pease situation into a win-win.
Oh, Lauren...
Your father's ashes are missing.
Really?
You lost the Connelly account and my father's ashes?
Lose-lose!
Kate?
Hello!
It's me.
Hi.
Uh...
It's late.
Did I wake you?
Hold on.
Hey.
So you must have really put the screws to Douglas Pease.
He pushed me really hard to let that kid go.
What'd you have on him?
Sometimes people just do the right thing.
No, they don't.
Not until you make 'em.
You know, you don't have to live out here, Kate.
You took a bad settlement.
Mm.
I don't like conflict.
Well, I'm just saying, I could spot you a year's rent.
You know, you can move back in the neighborhood.
No!
No, no.
I-I like it here.
- Really.
- Yeah.
I have friends.
Hi.
How are you this evening?
Oh... well, they're shy friends.
Can I, uh, you know, come onboard?
- We could talk.
- I have company.
Wow.
Hmm.
New tin man?
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
It's not my place.
You know, uh, maybe another time.
You know what, coffee or something.
- Coffee...
- Maybe.
Okay.
Yeah.
We'll do that.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good night.
- Yep.
Hey, Justin?
Yeah?
Dad thought that you were great.
Maybe even a little too good for me.
Well, he was half-right.
Good night.
Good night.
Okay.
Um...
Let's focus on...
What we have in common.
We...
Both have the same sense of humor.
And nobody has my sense of humor.
We, um...
Ah, yes.
We agree on the important stuff.
And that's important.
Um...
We both have strong beliefs.
You believe in the letter of the law.
It's absolute.
It's always right.
And I believe that laws were made by people...
And that people are often wrong.

Oh, no.
Oh, no-no-no.
You're not supposed to be here.
Oh, that's not the deal.
- Come on, K, we don't have a deal.
- We have a deal.
We most definitely have a deal.
- There is no sex, ever.
- Oh, come on.
And though we do have sex doesn't spin the night.
All right, you know what?
As much as i'd love to stay and discuss the *** points of our deal,
I have to go.
I have a huge meeting.
- Hey, have a great first day back.
- I hate you.
I'll call you.
Oh, you're such a lawyer.
Sorry.
Didn't want ********.
Mission accomplished.
Hi!
Can I help you with something?
Is that your boat in slip 41?
It is now.
It was my dad's, Terry Reed.
Did you know him?
- My wife and I, we're new here.
- Oh, yeah?
Sorry.
Well, even if you weren't, you know, he didn't sail very often.
If you don't wanna give people a wrong impression, you really should change the name.
What's the bad luck to change the boat's name?
Bitch.
- Did you just call me...?
- Anyway, I like it.
You know, it was my idea.
He was lonely, and then he met somebody, and then the boat was lonely.
So...
Anyway, have a good day!
Welcome aboard.
Hey, Spencer.
Lauren's been trying to call you all morning.
Really?
I just turned my phone on.
Kate, if she's called me, she's probably called you at least 10 times.
You know, what if there is an emergency?
I'm a mediator, I don't have emergencies.
At least, not professionally.
Look, she's calling me again on the other line.
Could you, please, call her back?
She's a bit obsessive, our stepmother, don't you think?
That's what dad loved.
- I thought it was her ass.
- That, too.
Speaking of dad, what are we gonna do with these ashes?
Are we gonna have a ceremony?
I don't know.
Lauren's got 'em.
Ask her.
I'll just give her some time.
It's only been a week.
Now, what about you?
Are you sure about going back to work already?
Well, I kinda owe it to dad.
You know, it's his firm, but it's your life.
Yeah, but those things are really connected.
Look, I gotta go to Debbie's crime.
Good luck today.
- All right.
- Don't forget to call Lauren.
- Oh, you know me.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Coffee, black, please.
- Sure.
- Gimme the money.
- Okay.
Gimme the money!
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on!
Screw you, pal!
Screw me?
Screw you!
Okay.
Hold on a second.
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.
Just put the gun down, 'cause you don't wanna hurt anybody, all right?
How's that coffee comin' along?
Um...
You seem like the kinda guy who knows what he's doing.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, so, uh...
We're not gonna have any problems here, right?
Yeah.
No.
Right.
Okay, good.
So just tuck the gun back under your shirt, 'cause you don't want someone to walk by, and then they see you and...
Right?
How we doing on that coffee?
Good.
Now, educate me.
What do you get when you rob a store?
You...
You know, money.
Right.
How much?
Gimme a number.
- 500 bucks?
- Yeah, right!
5...
Forget it, man!
Let's just say 100.
All right?
You get shot...
The emergency room is gonna cost you a grand.
So just give the guy 100 bucks.
- I'm gonna give him something.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.
What are you gonna buy with the money?
Beer.
And, uh... beef jerky.
Beer and jerky.
Nice.
That's a balanced meal.
So how much does...
Let's say 50 bucks of beer and jerky cost you?
- 17.50.
- 7... 17.50?
Are you kidding me?
- Who's robbing who?
- Hey, come on!
All right, fine, fine, fine.
So how does 50 bucks of beer and jerky sound to you?
I mean, I assume you're gonna be running, right?
- So that's all you can carry.
- That's...
Yeah, okay.
Okay, good.
So... 17.50 wholesale...
And we go on with our day.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
And my coffee, right?
You're gonna get my coffee.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.
Okay, good.
Black.
Okay.
There you go.
And, uh...
How 'bout this?
Good.
Okay?
- Ha ha!
- All right.
You're welcome.
Hey, hey, hey, that... that's 5.75.
For coffee and a cookie?
Those are organic.
- Spencer.
- Did you call Lauren?
- Nope.
I got held up.
- Kate...
- Gotta go.
Love you!
- Kate!
Ah...
Leo, my Leo.
Good morning.
Welcome back.
You look great.
Oh, what can I say?
Grief suits me.
Yeah.
Oh, you should try this.
It's apple chai tea infusion.
Eew.
I hate those girly drinks, Leo.
Your loss.
It's appletastic.
Uh, judge Nicastro's office called.
You're expected in his court at 11:30.
- He's got a case for you.
- Doesn't judge Nicastro know
I'm not a practicing attorney anymore?
It's a mediation.
You were specifically requested.
Okay, that's weird.
He hates me.
Yes.
Yes, he does.
You're supposed to say, "no, he doesn't, he loves you."
- Any other calls?
- Lauren.
That bitch just can't help herself.
- I mean, it's my first day back.
- Kate.
My father is not even cold in the ground.
- We can't all be obsessive-compulsive...
- Kate!
- Anal retentive...
- Ah!
She's right behind me, isn't she?
Kate.
I need you.
Now.
Yes.
Right.
I was just going over my schedule here with Leonardo.
- You need me back...
- ASAP.
S-a-p.
You have a tendency to panic.
You have a tendency not to.
Um, now that dad's gone, are you still my evil stepmother or just the evil managing partner?
Have you been to Masa's lately?
- What?
- Boulevard.
Aqua.
Gary Danko.
No.
I haven't done much dining out lately.
I've been mourning the death of my father.
You?
Hey.
I miss my husband.
Every minute.
But instead of sulking,
I am trying to protect the firm he loved.
By running up your expense account?
Oh, grow up, Kate.
Every law firm in San Francisco is wining and dining our clients, telling them to jump ship...
and it's working.
Ortho West left for Morrison Foerster, the Rixton Group for Wilson Sonsini, and Tinker Connelly, Ird Pallbearer, right side, dropped us the day...
Of the funeral.
I called his son from the limo and over drinks at the Morgan tonight,
I will get that business back.
Teddy Reed is dead.
Reed Reed is on life support.
I will do whatever it takes to keep it alive.
What can I do?
You know Charles and Douglas Pease.
Yeah, sure.
Pease, inc.
Women's clothing.
They're a big client.
Well, as you know, they've agreed to be bought out by a Canadian company.
Douglas will be in charge.
His father retires with a generous severance.
So what's the problem?
Well, they were supposed to sign the contracts today, but the old man called me this morning and tried to back out.
No deal for them, no fees for us.
Now, I convinced Charles to come in and talk it out with Douglas, but we need those contracts signed.
Get them on the same page.
That's what I do.
Pastels.
Primaries.
Stripes.
Solids.
- You have no idea, do you?
- That's not the point, is it?
- Gentlemen...
- You don't know what to think unless somebody graphs it for you.
- Gentlemen...
- Are you gonna run the company?
No.
You're gonna let bean counters...
Gentlemen...
You know Kate Reed.
Hey, Charlie, Doug.
I'm sorry about your father.
He was a good man.
I'll miss him.
Thank you.
- I'll miss him too.
- Thank you so much, Doug.
That's my boy.
Never an original thought.
Since we seem to be at an impasse,
I thought it might be helpful if Kate got involved.
We don't need a mediator.
Thanks anyway, Kate.
- I've made my decision.
- Right.
I've heard.
It took 14 months to put this deal together.
He was with it every step of the way.
This is his deal, and he won't sign it.
Well, he doesn't have to if he doesn't want to.
- That's not...
- But...
Do you mind just telling me,
Charlie, because this is so not like you:
What's the story?
Where's your head at?
Spring 1993.
I ordered Capri pants.
Everyone else... the gap, the limited...
They're all thinking bells.
I cleaned their clocks.
All of them.
That was a fantastic time, Charles.
What has that got to do with...
The business is not in your blood.
You don't feel it.
I built the company on instinct, intuition.
And that's your strength, Charlie.
And I'm sure that Doug has his own.
I have my MBA from Stanford.
I make decisions based on statistical analysis,
- trend-spotting.
- Pie charts.
We've had ten consecutive losing quarters.
We blame the economy, and so far everyone believes us.
But it's been a long time, dad,
- since you've cleaned anyone's clock.
- Okay okay, clearly you two approach things differently, but here's the part that I don't understand.
That was true 14 months ago when you started negotiating this buyout.
It was true a week ago, and it was true yesterday.
So what changed?
- Tell her about last night.
- It has nothing to do with...
- It's about judgment, Douglas.
- Please, dad.
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, Charlie.
What happened?
I was coming home from dinner with clients.
I was on the 280 heading south.
I'd just got on the bridge.
A red sedan crossed over the line and bumped me.
What the hell?
Whatcha gonna say now?
Whatcha gotta say?
I don't remember the impact.
It was instinct, you know, turning away from the gun.
I didn't...
See them at all.
- It just happened so fast.
- Did anyone I.D. the sedan?
Well, a good samaritan called it in, and there's a second witness.
The driver and gunman are in custody.
Now, if we go through this buyout...
We have to disclose the details of any pending legal action.
Well, someone pointed a gun at him.
- He's blameless.
- He was drunk.
Douglas had a blood alcohol level that was elevated.
- .09.
- Drunk.
I had two glasses of wine.
That's not why I crashed.
The courts aren't gonna see it that way.
- Of course they're not.
- And that's exactly why you don't want this to go to court.
So how do we put these thugs in jail and clean up Doug's mess?
Charlie, I was an attorney for five years.
I quit to become a mediator.
You wanna know why?
In court, somebody wins, but there's always a loser.
And it doesn't necessarily have to do with who's right and who's wrong.
Now, if we go to court, this is gonna limp through the system for 18 months and all the while, Doug's DUI is gonna become public record, which is exactly what you don't want.
I'm not just gonna stand by and do nothing.
Okay, the kids in the car...
that's an open and shut case.
The system's gonna take care of them.
They'll probably be offered some kind of plea bargain.
Our only concern is Doug's DUI.
We handle that, the deal can move forward, right?
Absolutely.
Charles?
Great.
So we're all back on the same page.
Win-win.
And you know what?
Kate has a unique connection to the d.A.'S office.
I am sure she'd be happy to use it.
Especially for such important clients like you.
Lauren, may I have a word with you, please?
Excuse us, gentlemen.
My father would never ask me to do this.
No, you're right.
He wouldn't.
He'd ask me to ask you.
It's business, Kate.
We use what we have.
Our clients can go anywhere for legal services.
Hell, they can get half of what they need off the Internet.
They come to us for our connections.
You have one.
We're using it.
Just do something with my father's ashes.
- Coffee.
Black, three sugars.
- You're forgiven.
- Where ya goin'?
- Hell.
He wasn't driving erratically or over the speed limit.
In fact, the legality of a sobriety test, given the circumstances, is questionable at best.
- You missed me.
- That's not why I'm here.
Well, you could have called.
- Lauren asked me to...
- Yeah, I know.
But you could have called.
Instead, you came over.
Because it's important.
Because you feel guilty about last night.
Why would I feel guilty about last night?
Oh, you're saying you're not here because you feel guilty?
Yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
- So you miss me.
- You're such a dick.
All right.
You're gonna like this.
Your gunman's got an extensive record.
Pointing a firearm at another driver from a moving vehicle's a class a felony.
- He's gonna do ten years.
- Can I see?
No, no, no.
Ha.
Attorneys only.
Sorry.
The driver's also looking at ten reducible to five.
Well, those are stiff sentences.
- My client will be happy.
- Pretty standard stuff, actually.
There's the possibility of catastrophic loss of life.
The vehicle itself is a weapon.
The gun compounds the threat.
The law was designed to keep gangbangers from taking their beefs on the road.
And what about my guy's DUI?
Well...
He's got no priors.
Given the circumstances, a good lawyer should get it thrown out.
Let's assume he has a good lawyer.
Ha.
Cute.
Okay.
We're done.
This wasn't just business, was it, huh?
Come on, be honest, Kate.
This was about us.
Justin...
I'm always honest.
It's my greatest flaw.
Well, it's one of them.
Yeah.
Remind me again why our marriage didn't work.
Ah.
Just did.
I was joking, Kate.
I was kidding.
Kate.
I was kidding.
Wait.
Okay, I get it.
You're angry.
I'm sorry.
This looks familiar.
I apologize.
- Not accepted.
Nope.
- I'm sorry, Kate.
I apologize.
Really familiar.
Could you get her on the phone, please?
Talk to me, Leo.
Hey, don't be late for judge Nicastro.
- He hates to be kept waiting.
- Oh, give me a little credit.
We'll get right outside of his courtroom.
Taxi!
[]
Sorry!
I'm sorry.
Judge, I am so sorry.
Really sorry about this.
No, you're not.
You're Kate Reed.
You have nothing but disdain for the law.
Okay, well, that's not entirely true, sir.
- You quit the profession.
- I'm still in the system.
It's just a...
Different part.
Ha ha.
- Mr. Brian Michaels...
- Yes, sir.
Is suing the three parties involved in his meticulously planned marriage proposal.
The proposal went awry, and his grandmother's wedding ring, appraised at $11,500, was lost.
So Mr. Michaels is requesting of one unemployed actor, one singing waiter, and one cupcake maker...
Damages totaling... $10 million.
Really, Mr. Michaels?
Yeah.
I just want what's fair.
- So do we, your honor!
- Your honor, I have...
Now, as much as I would love to have this case in my courtroom,
I thought that it might be better served elsewhere.
So...
Sit down.
So we're going to try something a little different...
Alternative dispute resolution, also known as mediation.
Bailiff.
- Kate Reed is not...
- Thanks.
A lawyer.
She is a mediator.
A mediator is kind of a referee in a game with no rules, except those agreed to by the parties involved.
Ms. Reed handles all sorts of disputes, some even bigger than yours.
Earlier this year, she was called in by the united nations to settle a border dispute between Colombia and...
Paraguay.
Colombia and Nicaragua, sir.
And it was their embassies here in San Francisco.
They border each other on market street, and they share a common wall.
But the u.N. Did call.
- They did call.
- Ms. Reed.
- Yes, sir.
- Find a way to keep this case out of my court.
- Okay.
- You've got two days.
Two days?
Judge...
There are three defendants, and this guy's asking for $10 million.
Two days doesn't seem exactly...
Okay.
How about tomorrow morning at 9:00?
Would you like to try for later on this afternoon?
- No.
- Find a resolution or you will be sent to prison for contempt of court.
Yes, I can do that.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Bailiff, call the next case.
Kate Reed's office.
Judge Nicastro really does hate me.
No, he doesn't.
He loves you.
That's right.
I forgot.
Okay, so why does he hate me?
Well... there's the fineman debacle.
- Yes.
Right.
- And the examiner interview.
- Okay.
That was bad.
- And the joke you made about his wife and the horse that his wife overheard.
So you're saying it's not random.
Oh.
I never said that.
I like you more every day, Leo.
Okay, um...
The complainants that Nicastro dumped on me will be there at 2:00, so...
Set 'em up for me in the conference room.
Done.
What about the Pease case?
Solved.
I'm amazing.
I'll be back in 20.
Next.
Hey.
Wake up.
- Where is he?
- Out.
- Lunch.
- That son of a bitch!
- Did you not read the file?
- Which file, Kate?
The file you couldn't possibly have read because I didn't give it to you?
The file that would be illegal for you to have in your possession.
Justin, Justin, the driver!
The driver!
Look, I'm in a meeting, Kate.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Sorry.
Hi...
- How'd you know where I was?
- It's Monday.
He'll have a polish with onions and a peach snapple.
- This kid is going to Yale.
- I'm sorry.
Isn't this the same kid you just asked me to put in jail?
Yeah.
But that was before I knew the full story.
Thank you.
- Justin.
Don't do this!
- It's my heart.
- You don't have a heart!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- God!
Read the damn file!
- Hey, I wrote the file!
And if you read it, that's a crime.
I'm gonna go talk to those kids.
Taxi!
Go ahead.
What do you think they're gonna say, huh?
They're gonna say what they always say... "I'm innocent."
I did you a favor.
You asked me to do this.
Certain things have been put in motion...
Hey, Kate!
Sir, can you put your arms out?
Thank you.
- I'm guilty.
- You realize that means...
- I'll do the time.
- D'Sean, this is a class "a" felony.
Nah.
Gun wasn't loaded.
It doesn't matter if the gun was chocolate.
You were in a moving vehicle.
You threatened another driver.
The d.A.'S gonna offer you ten years.
I woulda pulled the trigger if I knew that.
And ten years for Nathan.
Well.
He might only have to do five.
For what?
He was driving.
He's an accessory.
No...
Nathan didn't do nothing, he... my cousin...
- My cousin, he's...
- I know, but listen to me.
- He's clean.
- Listen to me.
- It doesn't work like that.
- Let me do his time.
He doesn't have to go down for what I did.
The courts are not gonna let you do that.
Give it to me!
He didn't do nothin'!
He didn't do nothin'!
He didn't do nothin'!
Say it!
Say he's innocent!
He didn't do nothin'!
He's innocent!
That's my homie!
You wanna take him away?
That's my boy!
"National honor society.
"Big brother.
All-state marching band."
Wow.
You're an impressive kid, Nathan.
Tell me what happened.
We were heading home.
Just...
Driving.
Listening to the radio.
And all of a sudden...
Ha ha ha... yeah, whatever.
What's up?
Don't y'all know how to drive?
What are you doing, man?
He took his piece out.
- You don't know how to drive?
- Yo, D'Sean!
- Yo, man...
Yo, relax!
- It's on, man!
No!
We gonna get pinched!
He wasn't gonna shoot or anything, he just...
That's just D'Sean.
- Chill!
It's all right!
- No, man!
The lady in the car, she saw the gun, I think, and freaked.
You said there was a woman driving the car?
- Yes.
- Did you see a man in the passenger seat or in the back?
I barely saw her.
Okay.
Why did D'Sean have a gun?
Everyone I know's got a gun.
'Cept me.
I'm the good boy.
So what kind of time am I facing?
Ten years.
Five if you plea out of it.
Or you could insist that you go to trial.
Um, you've got no priors.
Roll the dice.
Take my chances?
Well...
Yeah.
From the ghetto to Yale.
Just that right there...
Getting in.
I think I used up all my luck.
I don't believe that.
And you shouldn't either.
Why not?
There was definitely a woman driving the car?
Definitely.
Okay.
You've still got some luck left.
It's black and white, Kate.
Nothing is ever black and white.
The guy had a woman in the car.
That... that's not a crime.
The kids... they pulled a gun.
- That is.
- One.
One kid pulled a gun.
- There's no legal distinction.
- Okay.
But there should be.
What does any of this have to do with your mediation?
Why would Doug lie?
Why would he cop to a DUI when he wasn't even driving?
Because if a guy's gonna lie about anything, it's gonna be about a woman.
Your Doug would rather face a judge than face his wife.
Speaking of...
When's yours coming back?
- Terry's up in Seattle.
- Uh-huh.
Pitching a new account.
But coming back tonight...
For date night.
- Yeah, date night!
- Ooh!
- Ooh.
- Special.
- You got that?
- I thought you hated it
- when dad worked all the time.
- I did.
That's why I quit the firm.
Lila's gonna know her father.
Well, that's good.
At least she'll know one of her parents.
So...
Good work there, dad.
Did you come here to tell me that my marriage sucks?
- No, no, no, I...
- But you think it does.
Look, I just...
I think it's different than what you said you wanted.
I thought mediators were supposed to solve problems.
Sometimes.
And then...
Sometimes they just like to point 'em out, you know...
No charge.
♪ If I were king of the forest ♪
- I don't believe you.
- Talk to me, Leo.
The people from judge Nicastro's court are waiting for you in the conference room.
- Ooh, God damn it.
Oh...
- Nice.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Oh...
Aunt Katie's got a potty mouth!
Uh...
I gotta go.
I love you.
Bye.
- Love ya.
- I'll call you later.
All right.
Leo, something's not right with this Pease thing.
I need to head over there first.
But what about the people in the conference room?
Yeah.
Just tell them I'm running late.
- Oh, no!
Wait, wait!
- Okay.
Soon as my hearing comes back.
Wait!
Wait!
Please!
Ah!
Uh, taxi!
- Totally obsessive!
- O-oh, obsessive?
Y-you were drunk!
Ms. Reed's running late.
- You guys need anything?
- Boom!
I'd like to hear you say, Brian...
You were crying!
So you're all good then.
Okay, then.
I've got some good news and some better news.
I'm comin' in.
All right, well, I talked to the d.A.
The government's looking at ten years, and there is no interest in pursuing Doug's DUI.
Terrific.
That's everything.
I believe it is, yes.
What about the other punk, the driver?
Well, here's the thing.
There's two versions of the accident.
Wrong.
There was one accident.
Two parties involved.
One party of criminals, the other my son.
That's one version.
Do you know who was in the car?
Yeah.
Scumbag one and scumbag two.
D'Sean has a record, but Nathan the driver doesn't.
In fact, he's quite the model citizen.
He's got a full scholarship to Yale.
- He starts in the fall.
- Not anymore.
Nathan Henry's a good kid, Charles... he's smart.
Smart kids choose smart friends, not gun-carrying gangsters.
Well, maybe in the suburbs.
If Douglas grew up in hunter's point, he'd have friends with guns.
Oh, please.
I'm sick of hearing about how getting spanked when you were four gives you license to rob a grocery store when you're 40.
It's an excuse, and I don't buy it.
It is easy to be judgmental when you grow up with wealth.
The children of privilege aren't allowed to fail.
- It's not their fault.
- No, it's not their fault.
- That's right... exactly right.
- So whose fault is it that when you grow up in a lousy neighborhood you study your ass off to make straight as, you get the crap kicked out of you for not being in a gang?
I grew up poor.
I'm not a criminal.
Neither is Nathan Henry.
He not only survived and stayed clean...
He got a full scholarship to Yale.
Now, the gunman, he'll do his time.
He knows it's coming.
But you've gotta let Nathan off the hook.
You lack your father's clarity.
It troubles me.
It troubled him, too, sir.
Dad, maybe we're pushing a little too hard on this.
Does it...
Really matter if this Nathan goes to jail?
Yes.
Again, Douglas, judgment.
- Let's not lose sight of...
- When I asked if you knew who was in the car, I was talking about Doug's.
There was a woman driving his car.
Both boys saw her, and in the police report, a woman's purse was found on the floor.
Now, I don't suppose that your wife ran from the scene of an accident.
Carol-Anne was in L.A.
I'm sure she was.
No I.D. In the purse.
Cheap makeup.
Was she a rental?
Uh, I met her in the bar at the restaurant.
Oh!
What?
What?
Oh, yeah, wake up!
She had a room at a hotel nearby.
Never made it there, tough.
What was her name?
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't even know her name, and you let her drive the beemer?
That's the part that bothers you?
You pick up hookers a lot?
Well...
What's a lot?
Jesus, Douglas.
What's the point of all this?
Well, facts change.
Positions should too.
Everything's not so black and white.
All right, gentlemen,
I, uh, have another meeting to go to.
I'm gonna let you two talk.
Call me later...
And we'll wrap this up.
$10 million!
Do you know how much of a waste of time this is for me right now?
Oh, hey, I need Kate.
Oh, you know what?
She is busy.
She's got a court-ordered mediation.
All right, well, tell her I'm looking for her.
You know I will.
Leonardo!
Leo!
Hey.
Come here.
You know I would never ask you to do anything that comes even close to the border of illegality.
- Oh, I know.
- And I'm not asking you now.
Especially from your dungeons dragons buddies over at the police department or the DMV.
You've not asked me many times before.
Exactly.
This is just like one of those times.
The license plate number for Doug Pease's car.
Find out everything you can about him, the car, the night of the accident...
everything.
Why?
What are you...
What are you looking for?
I don't know.
Something just doesn't seem right yet.
- Okay, then.
- Yeah.
Conference room.
I read their file.
What do you think, like...
An hour?
Ugh.
Dinner and a pillow.
Ooh.
Fun.
Ha.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Kate Reed, and I will be your mediator today.
- Hi, Kate.
- Can you please talk
- to that idiot?
- These morons...
- I gotta get out of here.
- A million doll...
Better.
Thank you.
Okay, uh...
Brian Michaels, you wanted to make a memorable wedding proposal to your girlfriend.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Quite a complicated plan.
- Actually, it was very simple.
Oh, please!
- Yeah, like d-day.
- Psycho!
Jessica and I ordered a cable car, which is where we met three years ago.
I hired three people, each one representing one year in our dating history, to board the cable car at three consecutive stops...
The first to read my first love letter to Jessica.
The second to sing, time of my life.
And one was to present us with cupcakes with our faces in the icing.
- Oh, that's sweet.
- I know.
- Okay, so what happened?
- Well, the actor was drunk, the singing was terrible, and the cupcakes...
They looked nothing like us!
I wasn't drunk.
I had vertigo.
- I have talent!
- It doesn't matter.
I proposed anyway.
All right?
I presented Jessica with my grandmother's engagement ring.
She'd given me her father's watch.
He passed away last year.
He loved Brian.
I wanted to give her something just as special.
But their incompetence made us lose the ring.
- We never lost anything.
- You were going crazy!
- He attacked me.
- You murdered our song!
Don't make me...
Whistle again...
Please.
She dropped the ring.
I may have been technically drunk but...
- It's not my fault.
- Well, then whose fault is it?
- Yours!
- All right, Jessica,
Brian proposed.
He gave you the ring.
And then what happened?
Well, I was about to put it on, and then everyone started yelling and someone was trying to pass me, and the cupcake with Brian's face fell in this woman's lap and she screamed, and it...
It was gone, it was just gone.
There was nothing that you could do about it?
No!
I mean, you could have held on to it.
Oh!
I-I'm not saying it's your fault.
- Okay.
What are you saying?
- N-nothing.
I mean, I-I'm saying it could have happened to anyone.
- It's like you said.
- Exactly.
Could it have happened to you, Brian?
No.
I would have held on to it.
Oh, my God, you really do think it's my fault!
I didn't say that.
Actually, you did.
That's not what I meant!
- Okay, what'd you mean?
- N-nothing.
I just... oh, forget it.
I...
I-it's just it's really hard for me to understand.
That's all.
I mean, I would never lose your father's watch.
It's too important to me.
You think I lost the ring because I don't care about it?
That's... eh...
All right.
I'm gonna send you folks home.
- Yes!
- Okay?
So just be in court
- tomorrow morning at 9:00.
- 9:00?
I'm not even awake.
Actually, you know, I'd like to stay
- and watch this for a bit.
- Yeah.
No.
He's got some...issues.
Let's just get this all out right now.
Harrington.
Beware the one who whispers in the night.
He stokes the fire that never dies...
Oh.
Thanks.
Appreciate that.
And walks the eness circle.
What filthy creature of the night dares call by day?
Hey, it's Leonardo.
I need some information.
Open.
Close.
Open.
Close.
It's easy now.
- Open...
Close.
- In here.
Without my maniac fiancé screaming at me and people there freaking out!
It's one hand on the rail, one on the ring.
My leg is free.
Nobody's getting near this!
Nobody!
All right!
I think we got it all out, right?
Most of it.
A lot of it.
Let's just take a break.
Ooh.
Hot date?
Hmph.
Tim Connelly.
Yikes.
Once again, glad I'm not you.
I just got off a call with Charles Pease.
Thought you had everything handled.
- He's calling off the deal.
- But that's absurd, because when I left their office earlier...
You met with Charles and Douglas without me?
Yes.
Well, I-I got some information about the accident.
See, the boy driving the other car...
- Wait.
He's not our client.
- I know that.
But the boy driving the other car is innocent.
But he's not our client.
Aw, Kate...
I call you in to help, and now I've got to clean up your mess.
Wow, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I-I should never let an innocent kid's life stand in the way of our legal fees.
You know, is it me you hate?
Or lawyers in general?
Maybe it's the fact that I married your beloved father.
You know what?
He was beloved to me too.
My father was a lawyer.
My ex-husband is a lawyer.
My brother is a lawyer, and I was a lawyer.
And even though I carry around more than a small amount of self-hatred, if I really hated lawyers, I wouldn't work at a law firm.
And as for marrying my father, yes...
I hate you for that.
I thought my mother made him happy...
Until I saw him with you.
And I don't know what to think about that.
So I hate you.
It's simpler that way.
Is that you, the dwarf?
I'm the gnome.
In wintergrasp.
- Well, what is he doing?
- Defending the keep.
- It looks like he's attacking.
- I'm taking out the towers.
Even when you're playing defense, you've got to attack.
- Interesting.
- Mm-hmm.
Focus on the wrong thing, you get killed.
- I have learned much from you.
- Well, I am the master.
And you've taught me well.
Anything on Doug's car?
Not yet.
Okay.
Go home.
How's it going with the loving couple?
Good.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I feel a breakthrough coming.
Well, I-I'll stick around.
Still got some, uh, work...
To do.
Okay.
You didn't see that coming at all, did ya?
That it was her brother, right?
Oh...
I did not, no.
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
Oh, no, no, no, Tim, I am done.
I have another meeting.
I don't think you do.
You're so funny.
Oh...
Ha.
I get that a lot.
What do you want?
Oh.
It's...
Gratifying to know that I have your company's support.
Reed Reed will continue to provide the level of service...
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Look...
I'm easy, okay?
You guys do good work.
I got no complaints.
The old man was just trying to shake ya down for a better rate, the prick.
Don't worry...
I'm not gonna let him pull our business away.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate the loyalty, and you can be sure
I will go the extra mile to make sure you're happy.
What's that?
Extra mile.
Actually, it's more like an extra couple of floors.
I told ya I was easy.
- Thank you both.
- Our pleasure.
Oh, Tim...
I think we, uh...
Overindulged.
Thank you so much for the business.
Good night.
What, am I too young for you, Lauren?
You'd rather have drinks with my dad?
Hey, Lauren, I want my extra mile, okay?
Can I see your watch?
My watch?
Hmm-hmm.
The one Jessica gave you, her father's watch.
You know what, Brian?
I don't think you're ever gonna forgive Jessica for letting go of your grandmother's ring.
It's kinda hard to understand.
I'm just saying.
So...
The only way for you to get past this is to destroy something important to Jessica.
- Smash the watch.
- What?
- No!
- It's the only way.
And then you'll be even.
- Y-you're crazy.
- Brian.
- It's the only way.
- Brian, no!
- I-I won't do it.
- Oh, come on, do it.
- No!
- Just smash it.
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not gonna smash the watch.
- Smash the watch.
- No.
It was her father's watch.
She gave me the watch.
It's too important, I'm not...
- Aah!
- Oh...
Oh!
Oh, my God, I can't believe you just did that.
I'm so sorry!
What kind of mediator are you?
I loved that watch.
I loved how special it was to you that you wanted me to have it.
But that's how I felt about the ring.
Brian, I was devastated.
I'm sorry I made you feel worse on top of that.
Sorry that I made you feel the way that I do now.
I feel...
Oh, my God.
It's just a watch.
It's just a ring.
They're symbols.
We have the real thing.
I love you, Jessica.
- You, I hate.
- Ditto.
Oh...
Buffy the vampire slayer.
Wrong watch.
Sleight of hand.
It's easy to lose sight of what's important.
You focus on the wrong thing, you get killed.
I stopped breathing for a while.
No, don't do that.
Don't ever do that.
Brian, are you dropping the charges and moving on?
Moving on.
Excellent.
I'll see you in court tomorrow.
I'm awake.
And that's not funny.
Go home.
I haven't heard anything about the car.
It's okay.
Maybe tomorrow.
Definitely.
All right.
- I'm going.
- Okay.
- Oh, Leo?
- Yep.
Uh, you know that
Buffy the vampire slayer watch you have?
- Yeah.
- Well, I wanted to get one for a friend.
Where'd you get it, like toys r us?
Oh, no.
That's one of only three inscribed by Sarah Michelle Geller herself to commemorate the 100th episode.
That's why I keep it locked in the desk drawer.
Oh.
Okay.
Uh...
Well, I guess I'll just have to track down one of the other ones then.
Good luck with that.
It's gonna cost you a fortune.
He's worth it.
Hi, dad.
It's late.
- Yes.
- You home?
No.
You?
What do you think?
Tomorrow morning Nathan's public defender is gonna recommend that he cop a plea.
Why?
He didn't do anything.
I'll offer five years, and he'll take it.
- It's a good deal.
- It's a death sentence, Justin.
Look, I did what you asked, Kate.
He's not going to trail.
You're welcome, by the way.
For what?
He's going to jail.
Yeah.
Could have been worse.
This thing gets in front of a judge,
- the law says a weapon...
- The law, the law, the law!
God, what about the boy whose life is gonna be ruined?
Does he even matter in this?
Go you're just like my dad, you know that?
You make these laws up, and then you hold them up like they're sacred or something, like they're from God, like there's nothing higher.
But guess what, Justin.
There is.
There is justice and there is truth.
And who gets to decide what's true... you?
Five years, Kate.
It's a good deal.
For who?
You know what would be a perfect wedding?
- To elope?
- You're kidding, right?
Because I've already done the seating chart.
It's alphabetized and everything.
Your uncle asked to sit...
It's very late.
Tomorrow Nathan Henry's gonna accept a deal that sends him to prison for five years.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Sorry is meaningless, Doug.
Call the D.A.
He has discretion with the sentence.
Tell him that you don't want Nathan charged.
My father...
Your father doesn't make any sense.
You were in the car.
This is your decision.
I can't.
Why?
It looks like I've lost the job I wanted.
If I go against him, I'll lose him, and if I lose him, I lose the job that I have now.
I lose my house.
I lose...
Everything.
Oh, Doug...
Please.
This is so much bigger than you.
Stand up for Nathan.
Save his life.
Do the right thing.
I envy you.
You always seem to know what that is.
You've reached the cell phone of Teddy Reed.
I'm not currently available.
Leave a message, and I will return your call promptly.
Thank you.
I'll take it to her.
It's mine.
Sorry.
Uh...
You want me to toss it back?
No, hold on to it.
I'll come by tonight and pick it up.
Oh, will you?
I'm Andrew, by the way.
Kate.
Kate, I'm taking the boat out.
Sailing under the bridge.
Wanna come out for a sail?
God, you know what, that just sounds like a great idea.
But, uh, I've got this little thing called a job, you know?
Actually, I don't.
Mm.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Hold on.
Hey!
It was a messenger.
He... he said it was important.
- I was just...
- Psh, psh, psh... this is amazing.
This is epic.
Thank you so much.
This is exactly what I wanted!
Um...
I gotta go.
I can't be late.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You have a fantastic day!
Leo, I've got the picture.
Oh, my God...
Okay.
Uh...
Nathan's supposed to make his plea today, so tell Doug Pease I'm coming over right after court.
Judge Nicastro.
Good news.
Great news!
Mr. Michaels is dropping the lawsuit, and further, he agrees to drop all future lawsuits regarding the failed engagement plans and the loss of his grandmother's ring.
Mr. Michaels, is that true?
- Yes.
- Yes!
As long as I can still sue if something goes wrong with the wedding.
We're gonna have a hot air balloon dropping rose petals...
Enough?
Okay?
You're driving yourself crazy.
- Makin' me crazy.
- I just want the wedding to be everything that the proposal wasn't, you know, unexpected and surprising.
Me too.
Why don't we just get married right now?
W-eh... here?
I mean, why not?
We have everything we need.
We have witnesses and a judge.
I mean, come on!
- Are you surprised?
- Y-yeah!
It's unexpected.
I didn't expect it.
Brian, now or never.
- Now.
- Judge.
By the power vested in me by the state of California,
I now pronounce you man and wife.
- That's it?
- There's some paperwork.
Yay!
Okay.
Picture time.
Smile.
Aw!
Congratulations!
- Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome.
When I have any future conflicts, can I... 15-minute recess.
Newlyweds, meet me in my chambers.
I'm gonna need some signatures, and then you can begin your lifetime of happiness.
- You three are free to go.
- Whoo!
Ha ha!
Thank you.
I really love my watch.
- Later.
- Bye.
Bailiff, take Ms. Reed into custody.
What?
Why?
Because I took a picture?
You were four minutes late.
God.
Everything's a technicality.
- I hate courts.
- I know you do.
Wait, wait, you can't be serious about this.
I mean, does justice look like this?
I knew you'd recognize it when you saw it.
What?
Hold on!

Leo.
Hey, are the new contracts in?
They're being messengered over to the Pease building.
Lauren's on her way to see Charles, and Douglas is expecting you.
- Are you almost there?
- I'm walking into the lobby.
Sure, you are.
Hello!
Hello!
Excuse me!
Sir!
Somebody!
Oh!
Justin!
Justin!
Hey!
Hi!
Did you get the message I left?
Yes.
And I moved Nathan's plea to the end of the day.
Oh!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- I really gotta run.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait...
Hold on.
I need a teeny, tiny favor.
Justin!
Is there something specific that's bothering you?
I-is there a deal point that can be improved on?
Maybe the share valuation.
It's just not going to happen, Lauren.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
Please, I just have a couple more thoughts.
Put them in an email.
I'll do that.
We need to look past the third quarter.
Doug!
Doug, hey.
...Can we... can we talk in private?
- No.
- No?
Okay.
Well...
It's amazing technology, these photo cameras.
Uh, go on ahead.
Crystal clear picture, don't you think?
Yep.
What do you want?
I want you to do the right thing.
I'll be in your father's office.
- Kate!
- Excuse me.
What do you want?
I want what I've always wanted, what's best for you, what's best for Doug, and what's best for Nathan Henry.
That young man is not my concern.
No, he's mine.
I was driving.
It's my decision.
I'm gonna ask to have the charges dropped.
I'll let the D.A. know that he'll be hearing from you this morning.
W-what are you doing?
Why are you here?
- Our business is done.
- No, it's not.
Don't contradict me, young lady.
Oh, I always finish what I start, Charlie.
My father taught me that.
He taught me a lotta things.
I'm sure he tried, but I doubt you were really listening.
God, you're just like my dad!
My gosh.
You don't wanna retire because you're afraid you're gonna disappear, but...
Oh, save the psychobabble...
You keep trying to hold on so tightly, Charles, that that's exactly what's gonna happen.
You will disappear, because when you die, everything you know will die with you.
But it doesn't have to.
It can live on.
Is this your way of pushing me out?
- Is this all your idea?
- No.
Douglas's idea is that you stay on as chairman.
Oh, I-I think that is an idea with some merit.
- So now you're on her side.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm on your company's side, Charles, always.
Douglas runs the company as president, and you keep an eye on the big picture.
You mentor him.
You pass down what you know.
That way, you'll have a legacy.
And it'll be around even when you're not.
Douglas has his own ideas.
He doesn't wanna listen to mine...
He never did.
I can try.
You're gonna make me read those damn pie charts, aren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
It's a smart move, Charles.
If I see the word emeritus or acting next to chairman,
- the deal's off.
- No, you'll be the real chairman, dad.
- That's right!
- Charlie.
Are you and Doug on the same page now?
Excellent.
Great.
Well, we'll need to amend the deals.
- I'll have our contractor...
- Hold, please.
I took the liberty.
New contracts.
Now, gentlemen...
If you will...
Just... initial at the XS.
Have you started thinking about next year's summer line?
- Yeah.
A little.
- A little is not good enough.
- We need designs by next month.
- I know.
We'll have them.
A little.
Nice work, boys.
Great.
Well.
Look at that.
Win-win.
You blindsided me.
I got the job done.
- How?
- Trade secret.
No.
I don't think so.
There was no woman in the car.
See, everyone was telling the truth.
There was a woman driving...
And Doug was the only person in the car.
- Hey, yo!
- What the hell?
- You don't know how to drive?
- Oh, God!
Ah!
Yo, put the piece away, man!
Yeah, that's right!
Oh, my...
Why can't you use your desk?
No privacy.
Didn't think you were coming in.
Ohh.
Yeah.
Me neither.
Leo, have you been working out?
Let's not play that charade today.
What?
I gave up my planeswalkers to get that picture.
Dungeons Dragons?
- It's magic cards.
- Magic cards.
Planeswalkers...
Travel through planes of existence.
And they're very hard to get.
Interesting.
Just...
Just say thank you.
Is that a new sweater vest?
You never say thank you.
That's not true.
Thank you.
Kate.
Hey, Lauren.
What?
You wanna give me a raise?
Oh!
No, you are willing to admit that lawyers burn bridges and mediators build them.
You wanna congratulate me on turning the Pease situation into a win-win.
Oh, Lauren...
Your father's ashes are missing.
Really?
You lost the Connelly account and my father's ashes?
Lose-lose!
Kate?
Hello!
It's me.
Hi.
Uh...
It's late.
Did I wake you?
Hold on.
Hey.
So you must have really put the screws to Douglas Pease.
He pushed me really hard to let that kid go.
What'd you have on him?
Sometimes people just do the right thing.
No, they don't.
Not until you make 'em.
You know, you don't have to live out here, Kate.
You took a bad settlement.
Mm.
I don't like conflict.
Well, I'm just saying, I could spot you a year's rent.
You know, you can move back in the neighborhood.
No!
No, no.
I-I like it here.
- Really.
- Yeah.
I have friends.
Hi.
How are you this evening?
Oh... well, they're shy friends.
Can I, uh, you know, come onboard?
- We could talk.
- I have company.
Wow.
Hmm.
New tin man?
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
It's not my place.
You know, uh, maybe another time.
You know what, coffee or something.
- Coffee...
- Maybe.
Okay.
Yeah.
We'll do that.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good night.
- Yep.
Hey, Justin?
Yeah?
Dad thought that you were great.
Maybe even a little too good for me.
Well, he was half-right.
Good night.
Good night.
Okay.
Um...
Let's focus on...
What we have in common.
We...
Both have the same sense of humor.
And nobody has my sense of humor.
We, um...
Ah, yes.
We agree on the important stuff.
And that's important.
Um...
We both have strong beliefs.
You believe in the letter of the law.
It's absolute.

The victim -- Colleen Emily Watkins. 32.
How many times was she stabbed?
Four or five.
There's some defensive cuts on her hands and arms.
Neighbor saw the door ajar this morning, called 911.
Her skin color, dried blood --
I'm figuring she died sometime last night, and I didn't see any pry marks on the door, so no forced entry.
Yeah, we add that to the little robe, she probably knew the killer, huh?
Crime of passion.
Do we know where she worked?
She was a college advisor at a place called Benford Academy.
Oh.
Fancy.
Heard of it?
Yeah, you know, it's that big place up on Mulholland.
The tuition's like half our salary.
Fools and their money.
Oh, it's home.
Uh...
Go, go, go.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello, hello?
Hey, mom.
What you doing?
Hi, sweetie.
I'm working.
What are you doing?
Okay, well, I think I finally got it.
I've been practicing with Uncle Davey.
Let me hear it.
It's better, right?
Yeah, that's -- that's really good, sweetie.
You know what?
You just got to -- you just got to really lean into that yodel, you know?
It's more like...
You know, like that.
You know?
Tell you what -- why don't you practice it some more, and I will listen to you when I get home tonight, okay?
I got to get back to work.
I love you, Nick.
All right, bye.
Sorry.
You know, you would think that someone who worked at a school like Benford would live in a swankier place.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Her bedroom closet is packed with designer clothes and shoes.
I don't know.
Maybe she was living beneath her means so she could dress to impress at the school.
That makes sense.
Uh, bed looks like she had company.
They're gonna do a rape kit, see if she had sex, and swab for DNA.
We'll know more soon.
We find the phone yet?
Not yet, but I'll get a data dump from the phone company.
Might take a few days.
Here -- her online calendar shows the victim booked from 10:00 to 4:00 yesterday, all first names.
Yeah, it's probably students.
We can check them against the school roster.
Did you find anything on her e-mails?
Eh, it's password-protected.
Hey, can you see what you can get off this?
Thanks.
Oh!
Is it Halloween?
'Cause there's some dude in here dressed like a TV detective.
- Did you lose a bet, officer?
- Yeah, in a way.
I got a call from Lieutenant Valdez last night to report to R.H.D. this morning.
I'm on loan as a detective.
Detective Rush.
That sounds pretty good.
Yeah.
So, why are you acting like you just got kicked down to traffic?
I like to make my own decisions.
I busted my butt for 10 years to break into R.H.D.
They're power-shooting you in, and you're complaining?
Look, it might be all right.
I'll give it some time.
Got to see how much I like all this standing around and chatting.
Oh.
Well, you better hope that's all you have to do 'cause you're not chasing anyone down in those Jimmy Choo's.
As I told this handsome man, um, Colleen's door was ajar when I got my paper.
That's not like her.
So I knocked and looked in and, uh, saw her on the floor, called 911.
Were you close to Miss Watkins?
Neighborly.
She was a sweet girl.
Looked after my cats when I went away.
Her boyfriend's nice, too.
Do you know the boyfriend's name?
No, but he's around all the time.
He works for that delivery company -- you know, the one with the shorts.
I know it well.
Well, thanks very much for your help.
Detective, what do you say you track down the boyfriend, see if you can bring him in?
You got it.
You and I will head over to the school.
Mm-hmm.
You know, we pride ourselves on preparing the kids to go out into the real world, as if it's something beyond this campus.
Alas, today's a harsh reminder that it's everywhere.
Headmaster O'Dell, it's our understanding that Colleen Watkins was the college adviser here?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Applying to colleges is different than it was when we were kids.
It's a full-time job.
And it's Alex.
Everyone here just calls me Alex.
And Colleen directed students to the right schools?
Oh, yes, and she was excellent at it.
Benford parents expect their children to attend very selective colleges.
Well, since Colleen's been with us, acceptance rates at the Ivys have skyrocketed.
Her death is a terrible loss for the school.
Alas...
Did you know if she was seeing anyone?
Oh, I try to keep things professional with my staff.
It just simplifies things.
Some of her colleagues may know.
I can arrange for you to meet with them, if you like.
Thank you.
We also have a list of students she met with yesterday.
We're trying to understand her state of mind before she died.
Sure.
Have you ever met any of her family or friends who didn't work here?
I know she had a boyfriend, but I never met him.
I think he travels a lot.
I don't know if it's what you're looking for, but Colleen usually had a salad for lunch.
She found me this great internship reading to blind people.
Colleges love that kind of stuff.
Makes you seem really charitable.
Colleen played tennis as an undergrad, and so do I.
Texas State something.
She also helped me get my S.A.T.s into shape.
She was...
I think she came from money.
She spent a fortune on clothes.
Everybody knew bits and pieces, but it doesn't seem like she had any close friends.
No one had ever been to her apartment, and none of them had ever met her truck-driving boyfriend.
Well, it makes sense if she was trying to move up in the world.
Neither her boyfriend nor her apartment come off as Benford material.
Oh, excuse me.
Sheppard.
Yeah.
Okay, great.
Great.
Romeo picked up the boyfriend.
Guy named Timothy Kane.
He's taking him downtown.
They wouldn't tell me how she was killed.
I just want to know what happened.
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
How long had you and Colleen been dating?
We weren't.
We broke up about three weeks ago.
But before that, we'd been together for... about six months.
Why'd you break up?
Different priorities.
I make pretty good money, but I wear shorts to work, you know?
That was never gonna be enough for Colleen.
When's the last time you saw her?
About three weeks ago, the night we broke up.
Detective Rush told me that you...
Transferred to a different delivery route.
Yeah, I got to know Colleen because she orders so much stuff online.
Um...
last thing I wanted after we broke up was to see her name on my delivery list every day.
So you still had feelings for her.
I didn't kill her, if -- if that's what you're asking.
No, that's not what I'm asking.
But I'm glad to hear you say that, so I can assume that you won't mind if we swab for DNA?
Where were you last night?
My shift ended around 10:00, and I went out for a beer with some of the guys.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Nice job tracking down the boyfriend.
Now, if you wouldn't mind checking out his alibi...
Hey, Romeo, this is the job.
It's connect the dots.
It's chasing down a thousand little details that might bust open a case.
I know.
I get it.
Colleen Watkins has a sister way out in Apple Valley.
Local P.D. is driving out to give her the bad news.
Is this the new guy?
Ah.
Ramon, this is Ted Buerge.
I'm sure you guys have lots to talk about.
L.T.'s been chatting you up.
But -- hoo!
Didn't mention the dancing shoes.
They call you Romeo, right?
Uh, Ramon Rush, patrol.
I'm on loan to you guys as a detective.
Ah.
I love new guys.
I got to be in court today with Van Stone.
Pick up my shirts for me, okay, handsome?
It's just a game.
Do we like the ex-boyfriend as the doer?
He has motive, but we're checking out his alibi.
S.I.D. got into Colleen Watkins' e-mail account.
She's been receiving steamy messages for the last month or so.
Well, that would fit the timeline.
She broke up with her boyfriend about -- what?
-
- Three weeks ago.
You got a name?
Yeah, I do.
And if either of you recognize it, let me know.
His name is smoothloverx.
Now, it's a hotmail account, so we don't have a name, but I can read you one of his e-mails.
Oh, whoa.
That's not necessary.
"Dearest Colleen, your touch has unleashed the lion in me."
Okay, I think we --
"My days are spent in reverie, imagining the next time your mouth, your tongue --"
okay, you know, I get it.
Uh, wait a minute.
"Your breath is on my skin.
"That we must be discreet,
"that I can't shout your name from the rooftop,
"tears my soul asunder.
Alas --" Okay, who says "asunder"?
The same guy who says "alas."
O'Dell, the headmaster.
So Colleen Watkins was sleeping with her boss.
Yes.
And her boss calls himself smoothloverx.
Ew!
Ew!
So, you lied to us.
You were having an affair with Colleen Watkins.
Smoothloverx.
Those are personal.
Yes, and they were florid and fraught with cliché.
Do you write notes like that to the missus?
Look, I-I liked Colleen, I had fun with her, but I never had any intention of leaving my wife.
Did she know that?
Yes, Colleen was aware of my situation.
Well let's see if I can understand your situation.
You knew how important it was for Colleen to be at Benford, so you used your power and your position to seduce her.
And then when you got tired of the arrangement, you --
I didn't kill her.
Where were you last night?
I was in my office, at school, writing a speech for alumni weekend.
I was there till 11:00.
And did anyone see you there?
No.
Hmm.
Where was your wife?
Um, she -- she was at a board meeting.
She got home after I did.
And when we talk to her, she'll be able to tell us the same thing.
I didn't kill Colleen.
We'll need to take some prints and collect some DNA.
Is there, uh, any way of keeping this quiet?
Benford can't really afford any more bad publicity.
What do you mean "any more"?
A family sued the school after their son was rejected from Dartmouth.
Th-the lawsuit named Colleen as a defendant.
The case was dismissed, but the school's still recovering.
Alas...
Alas, a lawsuit and an affair.
Any other grenades you'd like to throw into the fire?
- Does the school get sued a lot?
- No.
No, b-but families like the Delgados expect us to work miracles.
If you're looking for someone with an ax to grind against Colleen, I'd look at them.
Hang on.
Sheppard.
Yes, this is she.
Oh, well, what did he do?
Yeah, I can do that.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Nick's principal wants to see me.
She say why?
No, she just said she wants to see me.
Today.
Patrick's an amazing kid, and we spent every dime that we have to send him to Benford.
Yeah, then he was rejected from Dartmouth -- early decision.
Another boy from his class got in, a boy with lower grades.
But his parents gave money to Benford for a new gym.
So you think that Colleen was giving this rich kid preferential treatment.
They talk a good game about scholarship and diversity.
But at the end of the day, we were never accepted.
So, where were you two last night?
Here, with Patrick.
We had a late shipment.
And we didn't get home until midnight.
Check the security tapes, if you want.
It's all there.
- Tell me you're not saying anything crazy.
- Patrick!
No, for the zillionth time, I told you it wasn't
Colleen's fault that Dartmouth didn't want me.
She did everything she could to help.
I just didn't have what it takes.
I don't see them doing this.
Hey, 'Chelle, did their son, Patrick -- did he seem kind of anxious to you?
He seemed embarrassed by the whole thing.
No, it was more than that.
It was like he was agitated.
I'll have a uniform come back for all the security tapes.
Hopefully, Patrick is in them with his parents.
You know, they -- they spent everything to send their kid to this school, and they just looked miserable.
Yeah, well, you know, it's tough.
You always want the best for your kids.
Yeah, well, we didn't go to Ivy League schools.
State colleges worked pretty good for you and me.
Good job, good money, solid benefits.
Oh, yeah.
I'd die without the dental.
I got this genetic plaque thing, and it's like it takes, like, an ice pick to get that stuff out of there.
Yeah, not that I don't love your dental horror stories...
Excuse me.
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
Thanks.
Coroner's report just came in.
They confirmed Colleen Watkins died around 9:00 last night from her knife wounds.
They also said that she had intercourse, but her partner used a condom, so DNA is a long shot.
Hey, Nick, how was school today?
You know, school.
Anything special happen?
Nope.
All right, Nick, why is the principal calling me, huh?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
Look, let me talk to Uncle Davey.
Uncle Davey's in the shower.
Mom, I really can't talk right now.
Leo and I are doing a science project.
For school?
For fun.
Bye.
He must have done something really bad.
Are you ready?
3, 2, 1.
Start the timer.
What about the family with the nursery?
Well, they were upset but not insanely so.
Their son seemed jumpy, so we're checking out his alibi, as well as theirs.
This was a crime of passion, and there's plenty of passion to go around.
The ex, Tim Kane, was kicked to the curb because Colleen was embarrassed of him, and Alex O'Dell was cheating on his wife.
And how are the alibis on those two?
Well, Rush is tracking the ex's delivery schedule, and O'Dell didn't have one.
We're bringing his wife in to see if she knew about the affair.
Curious to see just how passionate she was about her marriage.
Any physical evidence?
The knife was wiped clean, and whoever she had sex with used a condom, so...
Did you get anything else off the victim's computer?
Just that the girl loved to shop.
I mean, there are a few third-party web addresses that S.I.D. is still trying to crack.
Uh, Mrs. O'Dell is here.
Nice shoes, detective.
It's good to see someone take a little pride in their appearance around here.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna head out.
Mrs. O'Dell, how long had you known that your husband was having an affair with Colleen Watkins?
Almost from the get-go.
Alexander's not really capable of keeping a secret from me.
And you never felt that the affair would threaten your marriage?
My husband and I connect on many levels, but romance isn't one of them.
We each have our own special friends for that, and we're fine with it.
You know, I noticed at the school that a number of the girls were quite taken with him.
Do you think that your husband would ever become involved with one of his students?
He's always getting poems and flowers and cards, but he'd never risk crossing that line.
He enjoys his job too much.
Why have the devotion of just one when he can be adored by them all?
Hmm.
I just spoke with the victim's sister.
She said Tim Kane went all stalker on Colleen after she broke up with him -- waiting for her at apartment, following her to school, begging for a second chance.
This all fits with what Romeo found out.
Yeah, something wasn't making sense when I tracked the ex-boyfriend's delivery schedule, so I talked to the guy who took over his old route.
The guy was supposed to deliver a package to Colleen.
The ex took it and told him he was going over to her house anyway.
The victim signed for the package at 8:14.
The ex returned the truck at 10:06.
But Colleen's apartment is only a 20-minute drive.
So that puts an angry ex-boyfriend in her apartment delivering a package less than an hour before the murder.
Colleen signed for a package that you delivered at 8:14, an hour before she was dead.
Okay, you've been stalking her all hours of the night, and you expect us to believe that you were not involved?
I never touched her.
So you didn't have sex with her.
I didn't kill her.
She was upset.
I-I-I could tell as soon as she opened the door that she'd been crying.
- Did she explain why?
- No, no.
She just...hugged me.
And then you had sex with her.
Yeah.
I mean no.
No, not right away, no.
It wasn't -- it wasn't like that.
Colleen initiated, not me.
Well, that must have been very confusing for you, what with all the feelings you still had for her.
Is that the first time that you'd been intimate with Colleen since the breakup?
So you must have thought that you had a chance at getting back together with her, huh?
Yeah.
I thought I had a shot.
But she told you you didn't.
No, I'm just another embarrassing thing in her rearview mirror, like her family's farm or the little state college she went to in Texas.
God forbid anybody at Benford ever hear anything about me.
I couldn't get her where she wanted to go.
Maybe that's why she had an affair with somebody at Benford.
You didn't know about that.
No, but it explains a lot.
So, then, that's -- that's why she was crying when I dropped off the package, right?
Some other dude.
Hey, this package -- do you happen to know where it was in the apartment?
The kitchen counter, maybe.
Any idea what was in it?
Shoes, clothes, shampoo --
Colleen ordered her whole life online.
All right.
Sit tight.
You're not going anywhere.
Well, he's big enough and hurt enough.
Plus, he got double-dumped.
For 17 minutes, he thought that they were back together.
17?
With an ex, you're lucky to get 12.
Well, somebody has a digital clock in their bedroom.
Hey, I get sex with an ex.
There's no instruction manuals, there's no surprises, and it definitely does not raise the number.
Yeah, but it's still tricky, you know?
One person's always more invested than the other, you know?
Hey, I don't remember seeing a package at Colleen's apartment.
You?
No, and I stood right next to the counter.
I wonder what happened to it.
Hey, you know what?
I got to go.
I got to get to Nick's school for that meeting with the principal.
Okay, and I'll put the ex on ice for the night.
There's enough to hold him.
On the way home, I'll stop by Colleen's apartment, see if I can find that package.
All right.
Wish me luck.
What you doing?
Going over these delivery records for Dulcett on the Colleen Watkins' case.
Ain't cop work a hoot?
Uh, lieutenant has a task for you.
Yeah, as soon as I'm finished with this --
L.T. needs it asap.
He takes priority.
Need you to dig up a file -- last name Maines, first name Myra.
It's personal.
On the D.L.
Don't just leave it on his desk.
Make sure you put it in his hand.
Mack, Madden, Mahoney...
Maines.
Hey, I've got a file for the lieutenant.
Oh, I'll take it.
Oh, I'm supposed to put it directly in his hands.
Uh, any idea where he went?
He headed toward reception.
Hey, have you seen the L.T.?
No.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey, lieutenant heard you were looking for Myra Maines.
"My remains"?
Buerge, right?
Yeah.
That file's been suckering rookies for a hundred years.
You know how I'd get even?
Pizzas.
Like 20 of them in his name.
Why don't you put that back for the next guy?
Welcome aboard, detective.
Hey, Buerge.
Hey.
Hey, I gave the lieutenant the file.
He thought it was a riot.
Don't even think about getting me back.
I've heard it all.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Just so you know, women throw themselves at me everywhere I go.
Mm.
At the car wash, the supermarket, even the dry-cleaners.
It's insane how much tail I get.
Damn it.
You win.
How's it going?
Damn it!
Nick's always had a ton of energy.
You know, he probably gets that from me.
I'm always saying, you know,
"Nick, use your powers for good, not evil," you know?
Not -- not that he's evil, you know what I mean?
Not, like, stuff that I've seen, of course.
Mrs. Sheppard, Nick's not in trouble.
He -- what?
That's not why you're here.
Oh, good.
Um...
Really?
Just the opposite, in fact.
Um, your son received the highest scores in this school's history on the G.S.E.
My Nick?
You should be very proud.
But he's always saying that school is so boring.
No offense.
None taken.
That's not uncommon with really bright children.
The work doesn't challenge them, so they tune out.
Wow.
It's just, um...
It's amazing.
Well, is there some extra stuff that he should be doing, like...
Spelling words or --
That's why I wanted you to come in.
As much as we would love to keep Nick here at our school,
I'm not sure we have the resources he needs.
You just lost me.
What?
Nick needs to be surrounded by peers of his intelligence level.
If I were you, I would check into some of the more academic private schools.
I mean, how is this even possible, you know?
I mean, I'm his mom and a detective.
How could I have missed this?
Genius.
Really?
It's just...
He's pretty diabolical in DD.
Yeah, but, you know,
I expect Nick to be that kind of genius, okay?
That kind of genius I can handle.
But what am I supposed to do with this one, you know?
The real kind -- you know, the kind that has to go to private schools and have tutors and cellos and -- Cellos?
Well, for instance, you know?
Look, I mean, part of the reason you guys came out here was because the schools were better.
Maybe you sensed his need.
Maybe.
I don't know, though, Davey.
You know what?
I was at a private school today, and, I mean, the grounds were just gorgeous, right?
The campus was beautiful.
They had all the resources money could buy.
But the kids there, they just -- they didn't seem like kids, you know?
And I don't know.
I mean, is that what we want for Nick?
Do we want to put him into that kind of an environment and...
I don't know.
Nick tends to roll with the program.
You sure you're not worried about how you'd fit in?
Well, I wouldn't.
I mean, I already know that.
But, then again, it's not like I'm a perfect fit in the school he's at now, you know?
I mean, there aren't too many other parents carrying firearms or showing up at parent-teacher conferences with a tranny hooker cuffed in the backseat.
Sad but true.
You know what?
The bottom line is that I am just gonna have to do the very best that I can for Nick...
The genius.
You know, you and your ex are both very smart people.
It's entirely possible that your kids are even smarter.
Ooh.
Well, maybe.
I don't know.
Let me clean this up.
Got a towel?
Hang on.
I'll get the phone.
Hey, 'Chelle.
Hey.
So, I went back to Colleen's apartment and I double-checked with S.I.D.
There was no package at the apartment or in the trash.
You know what?
Maybe we're asking the wrong question.
Maybe we should be trying to figure out what was in the package, and then we can figure out who took it.
Okay, I'll have S.I.D. track the sender's I.S.P.
Through the delivery company in the morning.
You know what?
I'm gonna head by Benford in the morning.
There was this girl that I talked to this morning, and -- and she knew about Colleen's days as an undergrad in Texas.
Now, if Colleen was embarrassed of her past, why is she telling this kid anything?
Hey, hey, give me a kiss.
That's a good question.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, no, I know.
Okay.
All right, see you then.
Bye.
Nick!
- Hey, how was your first day of school?
- Hey.
Well, I, uh...
Picked up Buerge's dry-cleaning.
I tracked down a delivery truck, and chased about a dozen stupid little details that are probably gonna go nowhere.
Yeah.
That sounds about right.
Not for me.
Why?
'Cause every day on the streets is a shoot-'em-up rodeo?
No, of course not, but --
You know what?
I don't know what this is really all about, but you are messing it up.
I don't remember asking your opinion.
You are looking at a chance to work in one of the best detective divisions in the world.
I waited 10 years for my shot, and for whatever reason,
Valdez is reaching out and offering you a shortcut --
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
No, no, no.
I caught every word.
If you can't recognize an opportunity... then maybe you should go back to patrol.
Nick?
I told you to go to bed.
No, you did not.
Good night, Nick!
He's going up right now.
Yeah, show me the computer.
It's nothing.
It's just a little thing that we were...
It's like math.
What do you mean it's like math?
You'll overreact.
No, I won't.
Give me the computer.
Mom, I won 50 bucks, right?
50 bucks.
That's great.
What?
Give me the computer.
Give it to me.
What do you mean you won fif--
Blackjack?
Davey?
Really?
Uh, am I in trouble?
No.
Can I keep the money?
No way.
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
What?
Are you kidding me, man?
Online gambling?
What are you doing?
He's 11.
I'm sorry.
- How good is he?
- Really good.
Really?
Yeah.
He split a pair of aces, and he caught two Queens.
What is that?
50 bucks.
Hmm.
I was looking at private schools today.
We're gonna need a whole lot more than 50 bucks.
Nick!
Stop it.
That's not funny.
You're such a --
Excuse me.
It's Madison, isn't it?
Yeah.
You have a good memory.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Colleen.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, walk me to class?
Sure.
Madison, how did you know that Colleen did her undergrad in Texas?
Oh, she told me.
We talked about all kinds of things when we worked together.
That happens a lot.
People confide in me.
Oh.
Well, that's wonderful.
I also noticed that you were very close to headmaster O'Dell the other day.
It's great that you have such a strong support network.
Still, it's got to be a lot for you, you know, losing your college adviser in the middle of the year.
It's not easy, but I try not to let it slow me down.
Yeah, well, still, you wouldn't be normal if it didn't set you back a bit.
Not my favorite word.
"Normal" might be okay for your job, but it's not going to get me into Yale.
That's what Colleen was helping me with -- focus.
When I mentioned headmaster O'Dell, you seemed uncomfortable.
Not really.
When I saw the two of you talking back there, he seemed upset with you.
Madison, if this has anything to do with Colleen, you should really tell me.
I couldn't tell you anything yesterday, not with Alex there.
After my appointment with Colleen the other day,
I went to the gym to get my tennis bag.
I don't know if this is hearsay or admissible, and I don't want to be a tattling bitch.
No one thinks that.
I saw Colleen arguing with Alex.
She was begging him to leave his wife.
He said that there was no way, but she was hysterical, and he was really, really angry.
Well, thank you for telling me.
Let's, uh, get you to class.
What do you have on the Colleen Watkins case?
We got a lot.
There's this girl, a student at Benford -- she's got a serious crush on the headmaster.
Anyway, she said that she saw him and Colleen arguing the day of the murder.
How is his alibi?
Nonexistent.
His wife's alibi does check out, though.
They both lawyered up.
We're still holding the ex because we've established that he was with Colleen around the time of the murder.
That is a lot.
Yeah.
Any word on the missing package?
'Chelle's having S.I.D. track the online shipping company.
We're trying to figure out what was inside.
You think the contents will clarify things?
Maybe, yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Your kids, they go to private schools, right?
Yeah.
It was my ex's idea.
Which one?
First and second.
Why?
Well, Nick, my eldest, he aced this test, and his principal thinks that we should send him to a better school.
Um...
So, anyway, I started looking online, and --
They all cost a fortune.
Yeah, I just don't see how I can afford it, unless I start knocking over liquor stores on the side.
I try not to think about the boat
I could have bought with all that money -
- Catalina 47.
You could sail it around the world if you want.
But most days, my kids love their school, and they're doing real well, so it's worth it.
Yeah, well...
Found what was in the package.
Adderall.
Lots of Adderall.
Colleen had prescriptions from three different online pharmacies.
She was getting almost 100 pills a month.
There's no way in hell this is for A.D.D.
Hey, what if she was pushing it on the kids?
I mean, at the Delgados' yesterday, their son said that Colleen did everything that she could to help him.
What if that included selling him Adderall?
Yeah, well, it would explain why he was so agitated.
You know, a lot of these kids abuse this drug because they think it's gonna raise their I.Q.
Yeah, they're morons for thinking that.
Only thing it will raise is their blood pressure, cause a stroke.
Let's go talk to Patrick Delgado.
Yep.
You were on Colleen's calendar twice in the last month.
Now, don't you think that's a little odd given that your parents sued her?
I guess.
Maybe.
We checked with your teachers.
The dates you saw her were right before you had big exams.
Was Colleen selling Adderall to you to help you study?
No.
Patrick, look -- you're 18 years old.
We don't need your parents' permission to take you downtown.
She wasn't selling it.
What, she gave it to you out of the kindness of her heart?
Colleen was more like a trainer for a sports team -- always careful about how she dosed us.
Only gave us the pills before a big exam to help us focus.
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?
You wanted to take it more often.
Thought it would make you smarter.
I told Colleen I'd even buy them from her.
She wouldn't do it.
So what'd you do?
Found another source.
Total bitch but fewer rules.
Are you talking about Madison?
Maybe.
I know my rights.
They need a warrant to search my locker.
Alex, please tell them they can't do this.
Look, I'm sorry, detectives, but Madison's right.
There is no way I can allow you to do this on school property without a search warrant.
We really need a warrant?
Well, I have to protect my students.
Well, we can get a warrant, can't we, 'Chelle?
Yeah, a couple hours, yeah.
Just know that, when we do come back, we'll bring about a dozen black-and-whites, sirens blaring, and we may even call in a helicopter so none of the neighbors miss out on any of the action.
Unless, of course, you think that might bring more bad publicity to the school.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
Hey, my father's gonna sue you both.
How could you?
I'm so sorry.
Hey, none of you can look in there without my permission!
Back up.
I have rights!
Yeah, you do have rights...
Like remaining silent.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say or do will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be appointed for you.
Do you understand the rights as I have said them to you?
I'm going to take Madison down to R.H.D.
Your parents know that we're going there and that we're charging you with possessing and selling narcotics.
My dad's a lawyer.
Yeah, you've said that already.
I'm sure he's gonna be really happy with your new career move.
Didn't know they could arrest somebody for being a bitch.
That kid was out of line.
He didn't think I was a bitch when he needed something.
You mean drugs?
You can't trick me into talking.
And even if you could, it wouldn't matter.
You're not allowed to interrogate me without my parents or a lawyer present.
I see.
Well, get in the car.
I know my rights.
I can say anything to you, and it's inadmissible in court.
Sounds like you know the rules.
It's, like, the only advantage to being a minor.
I understand.
Doubt it.
You have no idea what it's like to be me.
Perfect S.A.T.s, captain of the tennis team, and yet there's still no guarantee I'll get into Yale.
I couldn't have handled that when I was your age.
Most people can't.
But you're so smart.
Why deal drugs?
You don't need the money.
You're not listening.
My dad's a really good lawyer.
God, you sound just like Colleen.
Colleen knew you were dealing?
Most of her advisees started buying from me because I didn't have any stupid rules.
She just couldn't handle that I was more popular, so she tried to stop me.
She even threatened to tell Alex, as if she could ever turn him against me.
Really?
Did she try to talk to you about that?
Of course.
But the problem with Colleen was she never really understood her place.
Is that why you went to her apartment?
To remind her?
Because from what I've heard, you were not the only person who felt that Colleen didn't understand her place at Benford.
She's not one of us.
She works for us.
It's crazy.
It's almost as if she was trying to destroy everything that you've worked for.
Oh, I warned her that.
I mean, I tried to reason with her.
I'm usually really good at that, okay?
But she just wouldn't back down.
She slapped me, so I hit her back.
I've never hit anyone before.
I've never used a knife like that.
I just kept thinking, "she's gonna ruin everything!"
And there was no way I could let that happen -- not from someone like her.
I couldn't stop.
Then she was quiet.
Too bad you can't use any of that.
Well, actually, I can use all of it.
What don't you understand?
I'm a minor.
No, it's what you don't understand.
Now, I didn't go to Yale, but I'm pretty sure you just confessed to murder, and I'm a little disappointed that you didn't know this.
But, by law, there is no assumption of privacy in a police car, not even for a minor.
So I just, uh -
- I tape-recorded everything you said.
Let's see your daddy get you out of that.
Thanks.
Peace offering.
Hey.
Didn't know we were at war.
A couple of weeks ago, Lieutenant Valdez asked me if there was some patrol cops that I thought were real up-and-comers.
Oh, so it's your fault I got promoted.
Yeah, you have a very funny way of phrasing that, but, yeah.
Yeah, I thought I was doing you a solid.
Um, you can always go back to patrol, you know.
Mm.
Not without chatting the L.T.
Well, maybe someday you will explain to me what's so terrible about getting a bump.
But just so you know,
I really like seeing you around the office.
And...
Uh, I think you have the goods to be a really great detective.
Happy first solved murder, rookie!
Hear, hear.
Oh, I don't know what you guys are toasting me for.
I did nothing to solve this case.
That's not true.
You picked up my laundry, got my car washed.
Hey, in honor of your first case...
You want to grow up and be a real detective like me, you got to learn to dress the part.
Hey, hon, another round for the team.
And, uh, give this slick-lookin' dude the bill.
Hey.
Hey, newbies buy.
It's tradition.
That's right!
That's right!
All right.
Hey, uh, next weekend, we're gonna take a test for a different school.
Okay.
It's no big deal, you know.
You don't need to worry about it or anything.
We're just gonna...
We're just gonna explore our options, okay?
Do what's best for you.
Sure.
Honey, you're a smart boy, you know?
You need to be challenged at school.
You shouldn't be bored.
So this may mean that you stay at your school or, you know, you may go to a different school, so...
Okay.
The most important thing to me is that you're happy.
I am.
Good.
The standardized tests?
They're totally easy.
Well, for you, maybe.
For anyone.
You just need a strategy.
A strategy.
Mom, you know the bubbles you fill in?
Mm-hmm.
As you go down the page, you just have to make them go back and forth.
Sort of like a Christmas tree.
A Christmas tree.
Of course.
Nick, you're a genius.
Yep.

Dulcett:
The victim -- Colleen Emily Watkins. 32.
How many times was she stabbed?
Four or five.
There's some defensive cuts on her hands and arms.
Neighbor saw the door ajar this morning, called 911.
Her skin color, dried blood --
I'm figuring she died sometime last night, and I didn't see any pry marks on the door, so no forced entry.
Yeah, we add that to the little robe, she probably knew the killer, huh?
Crime of passion.
Do we know where she worked?
She was a college advisor at a place called Benford Academy.
Oh.
Fancy.
Heard of it?
[ Cellphone rings ]
Yeah, you know, it's that big place up on Mulholland.
The tuition's like half our salary.
Fools and their money.
Oh, it's home.
Uh...
Go, go, go.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello, hello?
Nicholas:
Hey, mom.
What you doing?
Hi, sweetie.
I'm working.
What are you doing?
Okay, well, I think I finally got it.
I've been practicing with Uncle Davey.
Let me hear it.
[ Off-key Tarzan yell ]
It's better, right?
Yeah, that's -- that's really good, sweetie.
You know what?
You just got to -- you just got to really lean into that yodel, you know?
It's more like...
[ Tarzan yell ]
You know, like that.
You know?
Tell you what -- why don't you practice it some more, and I will listen to you when I get home tonight, okay?
I got to get back to work.
I love you, Nick.
All right, bye.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Sorry.
[ Chuckles ]
You know, you would think that someone who worked at a school like Benford would live in a swankier place.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Her bedroom closet is packed with designer clothes and shoes.
I don't know.
Maybe she was living beneath her means so she could dress to impress at the school.
That makes sense.
Uh, bed looks like she had company.
They're gonna do a rape kit, see if she had sex, and swab for DNA.
We'll know more soon.
We find the phone yet?
Not yet, but I'll get a data dump from the phone company.
Might take a few days.
Here -- her online calendar shows the victim booked from 10:00 to 4:00 yesterday, all first names.
Yeah, it's probably students.
We can check them against the school roster.
Did you find anything on her e-mails?
Eh, it's password-protected.
Hey, can you see what you can get off this?
Thanks.
Oh!
Is it Halloween?
'Cause there's some dude in here dressed like a TV detective.
- Did you lose a bet, officer?
- Yeah, in a way.
I got a call from Lieutenant Valdez last night to report to R.H.D. this morning.
I'm on loan as a detective.
Detective Rush.
That sounds pretty good.
Yeah.
So, why are you acting like you just got kicked down to traffic?
I like to make my own decisions.
I busted my butt for 10 years to break into R.H.D.
They're power-shooting you in, and you're complaining?
Look, it might be all right.
I'll give it some time.
Got to see how much I like all this standing around and chatting.
Oh.
Well, you better hope that's all you have to do 'cause you're not chasing anyone down in those Jimmy Choo's.
[ Chuckles ]
As I told this handsome man, um, Colleen's door was ajar when I got my paper.
That's not like her.
So I knocked and looked in and, uh, saw her on the floor, called 911.
Were you close to Miss Watkins?
Neighborly.
She was a sweet girl.
Looked after my cats when I went away.
Her boyfriend's nice, too.
Do you know the boyfriend's name?
No, but he's around all the time.
He works for that delivery company -- you know, the one with the shorts.
I know it well.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, thanks very much for your help.
Detective, what do you say you track down the boyfriend, see if you can bring him in?
You got it.
You and I will head over to the school.
Mm-hmm.
O'Dell:
You know, we pride ourselves on preparing the kids to go out into the real world, as if it's something beyond this campus.
Alas, today's a harsh reminder that it's everywhere.
Headmaster O'Dell, it's our understanding that Colleen Watkins was the college adviser here?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Applying to colleges is different than it was when we were kids.
It's a full-time job.
And it's Alex.
Everyone here just calls me Alex.
And Colleen directed students to the right schools?
Oh, yes, and she was excellent at it.
Benford parents expect their children to attend very selective colleges.
Well, since Colleen's been with us, acceptance rates at the Ivys have skyrocketed.
Her death is a terrible loss for the school.
Alas...
Did you know if she was seeing anyone?
Oh, I try to keep things professional with my staff.
It just simplifies things.
Some of her colleagues may know.
I can arrange for you to meet with them, if you like.
Thank you.
We also have a list of students she met with yesterday.
We're trying to understand her state of mind before she died.
Sure.
[ School bell rings ]
Have you ever met any of her family or friends who didn't work here?
I know she had a boyfriend, but I never met him.
I think he travels a lot.
I don't know if it's what you're looking for, but Colleen usually had a salad for lunch.
She found me this great internship reading to blind people.
Colleges love that kind of stuff.
Makes you seem really charitable.
Colleen played tennis as an undergrad, and so do I.
Texas State something.
She also helped me get my S.A.T.s into shape.
She was...
I think she came from money.
She spent a fortune on clothes.
Everybody knew bits and pieces, but it doesn't seem like she had any close friends.
No one had ever been to her apartment, and none of them had ever met her truck-driving boyfriend.
Well, it makes sense if she was trying to move up in the world.
Neither her boyfriend nor her apartment come off as Benford material.
[ Cellphone rings ] Oh, excuse me.
Sheppard.
Yeah.
Okay, great.
Great.
Romeo picked up the boyfriend.
Guy named Timothy Kane.
He's taking him downtown.
[ Siren walls ]
They wouldn't tell me how she was killed.
I just want to know what happened.
Gloria:
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
How long had you and Colleen been dating?
We weren't.
We broke up about three weeks ago.
But before that, we'd been together for... about six months.
Why'd you break up?
Different priorities.
I make pretty good money, but I wear shorts to work, you know?
That was never gonna be enough for Colleen.
When's the last time you saw her?
About three weeks ago, the night we broke up.
Detective Rush told me that you...
Transferred to a different delivery route.
Yeah, I got to know Colleen because she orders so much stuff online.
Um...
last thing I wanted after we broke up was to see her name on my delivery list every day.
So you still had feelings for her.
I didn't kill her, if -- if that's what you're asking.
No, that's not what I'm asking.
But I'm glad to hear you say that, so I can assume that you won't mind if we swab for DNA?
Where were you last night?
My shift ended around 10:00, and I went out for a beer with some of the guys.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Nice job tracking down the boyfriend.
Now, if you wouldn't mind checking out his alibi...
[ Sighs ]
Hey, Romeo, this is the job.
[ Chuckles ]
It's connect the dots.
It's chasing down a thousand little details that might bust open a case.
I know.
I get it.
Colleen Watkins has a sister way out in Apple Valley.
Local P.D. is driving out to give her the bad news.
Buerge:
Is this the new guy?
Ah.
Ramon, this is Ted Buerge.
I'm sure you guys have lots to talk about.
L.T.'s been chatting you up.
But -- hoo!
Didn't mention the dancing shoes.
They call you Romeo, right?
Uh, Ramon Rush, patrol.
I'm on loan to you guys as a detective.
Ah.
I love new guys.
[ Chuckles ]
I got to be in court today with Van Stone.
Pick up my shirts for me, okay, handsome?
It's just a game.
Do we like the ex-boyfriend as the doer?
He has motive, but we're checking out his alibi.
S.I.D. got into Colleen Watkins' e-mail account.
She's been receiving steamy messages for the last month or so.
Well, that would fit the timeline.
She broke up with her boyfriend about -- what?
-
- Three weeks ago.
You got a name?
Yeah, I do.
And if either of you recognize it, let me know.
His name is smoothloverx.
Now, it's a hotmail account, so we don't have a name, but I can read you one of his e-mails.
Oh, whoa.
That's not necessary.
"Dearest Colleen, your touch has unleashed the lion in me."
Okay, I think we --
"My days are spent in reverie, imagining the next time your mouth, your tongue --"
okay, you know, I get it.
Uh, wait a minute.
"Your breath is on my skin.
"That we must be discreet,
"that I can't shout your name from the rooftop,
"tears my soul asunder.
Alas --" Okay, who says "asunder"?
The same guy who says "alas."
O'Dell, the headmaster.
So Colleen Watkins was sleeping with her boss.
Yes.
And her boss calls himself smoothloverx.
Ew!
Ew!
Gloria:
So, you lied to us.
You were having an affair with Colleen Watkins.
Smoothloverx.
Those are personal.
Yes, and they were florid and fraught with cliché.
Do you write notes like that to the missus?
Look, I-I liked Colleen, I had fun with her, but I never had any intention of leaving my wife.
Did she know that?
Yes, Colleen was aware of my situation.
Well let's see if I can understand your situation.
You knew how important it was for Colleen to be at Benford, so you used your power and your position to seduce her.
And then when you got tired of the arrangement, you --
I didn't kill her.
Where were you last night?
I was in my office, at school, writing a speech for alumni weekend.
I was there till 11:00.
And did anyone see you there?
No.
Hmm.
Where was your wife?
Um, she -- she was at a board meeting.
She got home after I did.
And when we talk to her, she'll be able to tell us the same thing.
I didn't kill Colleen.
We'll need to take some prints and collect some DNA.
Is there, uh, any way of keeping this quiet?
Benford can't really afford any more bad publicity.
What do you mean "any more"?
A family sued the school after their son was rejected from Dartmouth.
Th-the lawsuit named Colleen as a defendant.
The case was dismissed, but the school's still recovering.
Alas...
Alas, a lawsuit and an affair.
Any other grenades you'd like to throw into the fire?
- Does the school get sued a lot?
- No.
No, b-but families like the Delgados expect us to work miracles.
If you're looking for someone with an ax to grind against Colleen, I'd look at them.
[ Cellphone rings ]
Hang on.
Sheppard.
Yes, this is she.
Oh, well, what did he do?
Yeah, I can do that.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Nick's principal wants to see me.
She say why?
No, she just said she wants to see me.
Today.
Patrick's an amazing kid, and we spent every dime that we have to send him to Benford.
Yeah, then he was rejected from Dartmouth -- early decision.
Another boy from his class got in, a boy with lower grades.
But his parents gave money to Benford for a new gym.
So you think that Colleen was giving this rich kid preferential treatment.
They talk a good game about scholarship and diversity.
But at the end of the day, we were never accepted.
So, where were you two last night?
Here, with Patrick.
We had a late shipment.
And we didn't get home until midnight.
Check the security tapes, if you want.
It's all there.
- Tell me you're not saying anything crazy.
- Patrick!
No, for the zillionth time, I told you it wasn't
Colleen's fault that Dartmouth didn't want me.
She did everything she could to help.
I just didn't have what it takes.
I don't see them doing this.
Hey, 'Chelle, did their son, Patrick -- did he seem kind of anxious to you?
He seemed embarrassed by the whole thing.
No, it was more than that.
It was like he was agitated.
I'll have a uniform come back for all the security tapes.
Hopefully, Patrick is in them with his parents.
You know, they -- they spent everything to send their kid to this school, and they just looked miserable.
Yeah, well, you know, it's tough.
You always want the best for your kids.
Yeah, well, we didn't go to Ivy League schools.
State colleges worked pretty good for you and me.
Good job, good money, solid benefits.
Oh, yeah.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
I'd die without the dental.
I got this genetic plaque thing, and it's like it takes, like, an ice pick to get that stuff out of there.
Yeah, not that I don't love your dental horror stories...
Excuse me.
Okay.
[ Sighs ]
Okay, thanks.
Thanks.
Coroner's report just came in.
They confirmed Colleen Watkins died around 9:00 last night from her knife wounds.
They also said that she had intercourse, but her partner used a condom, so DNA is a long shot.
Hey, Nick, how was school today?
Nicholas:
You know, school.
Anything special happen?
Nope.
All right, Nick, why is the principal calling me, huh?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
Look, let me talk to Uncle Davey.
Uncle Davey's in the shower.
Mom, I really can't talk right now.
Leo and I are doing a science project.
For school?
For fun.
Bye.
[ Phone thuds ]
He must have done something really bad.
Are you ready?
3, 2, 1.
Start the timer.
[ Timer ticking ]
What about the family with the nursery?
Well, they were upset but not insanely so.
Their son seemed jumpy, so we're checking out his alibi, as well as theirs.
This was a crime of passion, and there's plenty of passion to go around.
The ex, Tim Kane, was kicked to the curb because Colleen was embarrassed of him, and Alex O'Dell was cheating on his wife.
And how are the alibis on those two?
Well, Rush is tracking the ex's delivery schedule, and O'Dell didn't have one.
We're bringing his wife in to see if she knew about the affair.
Curious to see just how passionate she was about her marriage.
Any physical evidence?
The knife was wiped clean, and whoever she had sex with used a condom, so...
Did you get anything else off the victim's computer?
Just that the girl loved to shop.
I mean, there are a few third-party web addresses that S.I.D. is still trying to crack.
Uh, Mrs. O'Dell is here.
Nice shoes, detective.
It's good to see someone take a little pride in their appearance around here.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna head out.
Mrs. O'Dell, how long had you known that your husband was having an affair with Colleen Watkins?
Almost from the get-go.
Alexander's not really capable of keeping a secret from me.
And you never felt that the affair would threaten your marriage?
My husband and I connect on many levels, but romance isn't one of them.
We each have our own special friends for that, and we're fine with it.
You know, I noticed at the school that a number of the girls were quite taken with him.
Do you think that your husband would ever become involved with one of his students?
He's always getting poems and flowers and cards, but he'd never risk crossing that line.
He enjoys his job too much.
Why have the devotion of just one when he can be adored by them all?
Hmm.
I just spoke with the victim's sister.
She said Tim Kane went all stalker on Colleen after she broke up with him -- waiting for her at apartment, following her to school, begging for a second chance.
This all fits with what Romeo found out.
Yeah, something wasn't making sense when I tracked the ex-boyfriend's delivery schedule, so I talked to the guy who took over his old route.
The guy was supposed to deliver a package to Colleen.
The ex took it and told him he was going over to her house anyway.
The victim signed for the package at 8:14.
The ex returned the truck at 10:06.
But Colleen's apartment is only a 20-minute drive.
So that puts an angry ex-boyfriend in her apartment delivering a package less than an hour before the murder.
Colleen signed for a package that you delivered at 8:14, an hour before she was dead.
Okay, you've been stalking her all hours of the night, and you expect us to believe that you were not involved?
I never touched her.
So you didn't have sex with her.
I didn't kill her.
She was upset.
I-I-I could tell as soon as she opened the door that she'd been crying.
- Did she explain why?
- No, no.
She just...hugged me.
And then you had sex with her.
Yeah.
I mean no.
No, not right away, no.
It wasn't -- it wasn't like that.
Colleen initiated, not me.
Well, that must have been very confusing for you, what with all the feelings you still had for her.
Is that the first time that you'd been intimate with Colleen since the breakup?
So you must have thought that you had a chance at getting back together with her, huh?
Yeah.
I thought I had a shot.
But she told you you didn't.
No, I'm just another embarrassing thing in her rearview mirror, like her family's farm or the little state college she went to in Texas.
God forbid anybody at Benford ever hear anything about me.
I couldn't get her where she wanted to go.
Maybe that's why she had an affair with somebody at Benford.
You didn't know about that.
[ Scoffs ]
No, but it explains a lot.
So, then, that's -- that's why she was crying when I dropped off the package, right?
Some other dude.
Hey, this package -- do you happen to know where it was in the apartment?
The kitchen counter, maybe.
Any idea what was in it?
Shoes, clothes, shampoo --
Colleen ordered her whole life online.
All right.
Sit tight.
You're not going anywhere.
Well, he's big enough and hurt enough.
Plus, he got double-dumped.
For 17 minutes, he thought that they were back together.
17?
With an ex, you're lucky to get 12.
Well, somebody has a digital clock in their bedroom.
Hey, I get sex with an ex.
There's no instruction manuals, there's no surprises, and it definitely does not raise the number.
Yeah, but it's still tricky, you know?
One person's always more invested than the other, you know?
Hey, I don't remember seeing a package at Colleen's apartment.
You?
No, and I stood right next to the counter.
I wonder what happened to it.
Hey, you know what?
I got to go.
I got to get to Nick's school for that meeting with the principal.
Okay, and I'll put the ex on ice for the night.
There's enough to hold him.
On the way home, I'll stop by Colleen's apartment, see if I can find that package.
All right.
Wish me luck.
What you doing?
Going over these delivery records for Dulcett on the Colleen Watkins' case.
Ain't cop work a hoot?
[ Chuckles ]
Uh, lieutenant has a task for you.
Yeah, as soon as I'm finished with this --
L.T. needs it asap.
He takes priority.
Need you to dig up a file -- last name Maines, first name Myra.
It's personal.
On the D.L.
Don't just leave it on his desk.
Make sure you put it in his hand.
Mack, Madden, Mahoney...
Maines.
Hey, I've got a file for the lieutenant.
Oh, I'll take it.
Oh, I'm supposed to put it directly in his hands.
Uh, any idea where he went?
He headed toward reception.
Hey, have you seen the L.T.?
No.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey, lieutenant...
[ Breathing heavily ] ...heard you were looking for Myra Maines.
"My remains"?
Buerge, right?
Yeah.
That file's been suckering rookies for a hundred years.
You know how I'd get even?
Pizzas.
Like 20 of them in his name.
Why don't you put that back for the next guy?
Welcome aboard, detective.
[ Sighs ]
Hey, Buerge.
Hey.
Hey, I gave the lieutenant the file.
He thought it was a riot.
Don't even think about getting me back.
I've heard it all.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Just so you know, women throw themselves at me everywhere I go.
Mm.
At the car wash, the supermarket, even the dry-cleaners.
It's insane how much tail I get.
Damn it.
You win.
How's it going?
Damn it!
[ School bell rings ]
Nick's always had a ton of energy.
You know, he probably gets that from me.
I'm always saying, you know,
"Nick, use your powers for good, not evil," you know?
Not -- not that he's evil, you know what I mean?
Not, like, stuff that I've seen, of course.
Mrs. Sheppard, Nick's not in trouble.
He -- what?
That's not why you're here.
Oh, good.
Um...
Really?
Just the opposite, in fact.
Um, your son received the highest scores in this school's history on the G.S.E.
My Nick?
You should be very proud.
But he's always saying that school is so boring.
No offense.
None taken.
That's not uncommon with really bright children.
The work doesn't challenge them, so they tune out.
Wow.
It's just, um...
It's amazing.
Well, is there some extra stuff that he should be doing, like...
Spelling words or --
That's why I wanted you to come in.
As much as we would love to keep Nick here at our school,
I'm not sure we have the resources he needs.
You just lost me.
What?
Nick needs to be surrounded by peers of his intelligence level.
If I were you, I would check into some of the more academic private schools.
I mean, how is this even possible, you know?
I mean, I'm his mom and a detective.
How could I have missed this?
Genius.
Really?
It's just...
He's pretty diabolical in DD.
Yeah, but, you know,
I expect Nick to be that kind of genius, okay?
That kind of genius I can handle.
But what am I supposed to do with this one, you know?
The real kind -- you know, the kind that has to go to private schools and have tutors and cellos and -- Cellos?
Well, for instance, you know?
Look, I mean, part of the reason you guys came out here was because the schools were better.
Maybe you sensed his need.
Maybe.
I don't know, though, Davey.
You know what?
I was at a private school today, and, I mean, the grounds were just gorgeous, right?
The campus was beautiful.
They had all the resources money could buy.
But the kids there, they just -- they didn't seem like kids, you know?
And I don't know.
I mean, is that what we want for Nick?
Do we want to put him into that kind of an environment and...
I don't know.
Nick tends to roll with the program.
You sure you're not worried about how you'd fit in?
Well, I wouldn't.
I mean, I already know that.
But, then again, it's not like I'm a perfect fit in the school he's at now, you know?
I mean, there aren't too many other parents carrying firearms or showing up at parent-teacher conferences with a tranny hooker cuffed in the backseat.
Sad but true.
You know what?
The bottom line is that I am just gonna have to do the very best that I can for Nick...
The genius.
You know, you and your ex are both very smart people.
It's entirely possible that your kids are even smarter.
Ooh.
Well, maybe.
I don't know.
Let me clean this up.
Got a towel?
[ Cellphone rings ]
Hang on.
I'll get the phone.
Hey, 'Chelle.
Dulcett:
Hey.
So, I went back to Colleen's apartment and I double-checked with S.I.D.
There was no package at the apartment or in the trash.
You know what?
Maybe we're asking the wrong question.
Maybe we should be trying to figure out what was in the package, and then we can figure out who took it.
Okay, I'll have S.I.D. track the sender's I.S.P.
Through the delivery company in the morning.
You know what?
I'm gonna head by Benford in the morning.
There was this girl that I talked to this morning, and -- and she knew about Colleen's days as an undergrad in Texas.
Now, if Colleen was embarrassed of her past, why is she telling this kid anything?
Hey, hey, give me a kiss.
[ Smooches ]
That's a good question.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, no, I know.
Okay.
All right, see you then.
Bye.
[ Bread smacks ]
Nick!
- Hey, how was your first day of school?
- Hey.
Well, I, uh...
Picked up Buerge's dry-cleaning.
I tracked down a delivery truck, and chased about a dozen stupid little details that are probably gonna go nowhere.
Yeah.
That sounds about right.
Not for me.
Why?
'Cause every day on the streets is a shoot-'em-up rodeo?
No, of course not, but --
You know what?
I don't know what this is really all about, but you are messing it up.
I don't remember asking your opinion.
You are looking at a chance to work in one of the best detective divisions in the world.
I waited 10 years for my shot, and for whatever reason,
Valdez is reaching out and offering you a shortcut --
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
No, no, no.
I caught every word.
[ Sighs ]
If you can't recognize an opportunity... then maybe you should go back to patrol.
[ Sighs ]
Nick?
I told you to go to bed.
No, you did not.
Good night, Nick!
He's going up right now.
Yeah, show me the computer.
It's nothing.
It's just a little thing that we were...
It's like math.
What do you mean it's like math?
You'll overreact.
No, I won't.
Give me the computer.
Mom, I won 50 bucks, right?
50 bucks.
That's great.
What?
Give me the computer.
Give it to me.
What do you mean you won fif--
Blackjack?
Davey?
Really?
Uh, am I in trouble?
No.
Can I keep the money?
No way.
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
What?
Are you kidding me, man?
Online gambling?
What are you doing?
He's 11.
I'm sorry.
- How good is he?
- Really good.
Really?
Yeah.
He split a pair of aces, and he caught two Queens.
What is that?
50 bucks.
Hmm.
I was looking at private schools today.
We're gonna need a whole lot more than 50 bucks.
Nick!
Stop it.
That's not funny.
[ Laughs ]
You're such a -- [ Laughs ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Excuse me.
It's Madison, isn't it?
Yeah.
You have a good memory.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Colleen.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, walk me to class?
Sure.
Madison, how did you know that Colleen did her undergrad in Texas?
Oh, she told me.
We talked about all kinds of things when we worked together.
That happens a lot.
People confide in me.
Oh.
Well, that's wonderful.
I also noticed that you were very close to headmaster O'Dell the other day.
It's great that you have such a strong support network.
Still, it's got to be a lot for you, you know, losing your college adviser in the middle of the year.
It's not easy, but I try not to let it slow me down.
Yeah, well, still, you wouldn't be normal if it didn't set you back a bit.
Not my favorite word.
"Normal" might be okay for your job, but it's not going to get me into Yale.
That's what Colleen was helping me with -- focus.
When I mentioned headmaster O'Dell, you seemed uncomfortable.
Not really.
When I saw the two of you talking back there, he seemed upset with you.
Madison, if this has anything to do with Colleen, you should really tell me.
I couldn't tell you anything yesterday, not with Alex there.
After my appointment with Colleen the other day,
I went to the gym to get my tennis bag.
I don't know if this is hearsay or admissible, and I don't want to be a tattling bitch.
No one thinks that.
I saw Colleen arguing with Alex.
She was begging him to leave his wife.
He said that there was no way, but she was hysterical, and he was really, really angry.
Well, thank you for telling me.
Let's, uh, get you to class.
What do you have on the Colleen Watkins case?
Gloria:
We got a lot.
There's this girl, a student at Benford -- she's got a serious crush on the headmaster.
Anyway, she said that she saw him and Colleen arguing the day of the murder.
How is his alibi?
Nonexistent.
His wife's alibi does check out, though.
They both lawyered up.
We're still holding the ex because we've established that he was with Colleen around the time of the murder.
That is a lot.
Yeah.
Any word on the missing package?
'Chelle's having S.I.D. track the online shipping company.
We're trying to figure out what was inside.
You think the contents will clarify things?
Maybe, yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Your kids, they go to private schools, right?
Yeah.
It was my ex's idea.
Which one?
First and second.
Why?
Well, Nick, my eldest, he aced this test, and his principal thinks that we should send him to a better school.
Um...
So, anyway, I started looking online, and --
They all cost a fortune.
Yeah, I just don't see how I can afford it, unless I start knocking over liquor stores on the side.
I try not to think about the boat
I could have bought with all that money -
- Catalina 47.
You could sail it around the world if you want.
But most days, my kids love their school, and they're doing real well, so it's worth it.
Yeah, well...
[ Knock on door ]
Found what was in the package.
Adderall.
Lots of Adderall.
Colleen had prescriptions from three different online pharmacies.
She was getting almost 100 pills a month.
There's no way in hell this is for A.D.D.
Hey, what if she was pushing it on the kids?
I mean, at the Delgados' yesterday, their son said that Colleen did everything that she could to help him.
What if that included selling him Adderall?
Yeah, well, it would explain why he was so agitated.
You know, a lot of these kids abuse this drug because they think it's gonna raise their I.Q.
Yeah, they're morons for thinking that.
Only thing it will raise is their blood pressure, cause a stroke.
Let's go talk to Patrick Delgado.
Yep.
You were on Colleen's calendar twice in the last month.
Now, don't you think that's a little odd given that your parents sued her?
[ Sighs ] I guess.
Maybe.
We checked with your teachers.
The dates you saw her were right before you had big exams.
Was Colleen selling Adderall to you to help you study?
No.
Patrick, look -- you're 18 years old.
We don't need your parents' permission to take you downtown.
She wasn't selling it.
What, she gave it to you out of the kindness of her heart?
[ Sighs ]
Colleen was more like a trainer for a sports team -- always careful about how she dosed us.
Only gave us the pills before a big exam to help us focus.
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?
You wanted to take it more often.
Thought it would make you smarter.
I told Colleen I'd even buy them from her.
She wouldn't do it.
So what'd you do?
Found another source.
Total bitch but fewer rules.
Are you talking about Madison?
Maybe.
I know my rights.
They need a warrant to search my locker.
Alex, please tell them they can't do this.
Look, I'm sorry, detectives, but Madison's right.
There is no way I can allow you to do this on school property without a search warrant.
We really need a warrant?
Well, I have to protect my students.
Well, we can get a warrant, can't we, 'Chelle?
Yeah, a couple hours, yeah.
Just know that, when we do come back, we'll bring about a dozen black-and-whites, sirens blaring, and we may even call in a helicopter so none of the neighbors miss out on any of the action.
Unless, of course, you think that might bring more bad publicity to the school.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
Hey, my father's gonna sue you both.
How could you?
I'm so sorry.
Hey, none of you can look in there without my permission!
Back up.
I have rights!
Yeah, you do have rights...
Like remaining silent.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say or do will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be appointed for you.
Do you understand the rights as I have said them to you?
I'm going to take Madison down to R.H.D.
Your parents know that we're going there and that we're charging you with possessing and selling narcotics.
My dad's a lawyer.
Yeah, you've said that already.
I'm sure he's gonna be really happy with your new career move.
Didn't know they could arrest somebody for being a bitch.
That kid was out of line.
He didn't think I was a bitch when he needed something.
You mean drugs?
You can't trick me into talking.
And even if you could, it wouldn't matter.
You're not allowed to interrogate me without my parents or a lawyer present.
I see.
Well, get in the car.
[ Sighs ]
[ Car door closes, engine turns over ]
I know my rights.
I can say anything to you, and it's inadmissible in court.
Sounds like you know the rules.
It's, like, the only advantage to being a minor.
I understand.
Doubt it.
You have no idea what it's like to be me.
Perfect S.A.T.s, captain of the tennis team, and yet there's still no guarantee I'll get into Yale.
I couldn't have handled that when I was your age.
Most people can't.
But you're so smart.
Why deal drugs?
You don't need the money.
You're not listening.
My dad's a really good lawyer.
God, you sound just like Colleen.
Colleen knew you were dealing?
Most of her advisees started buying from me because I didn't have any stupid rules.
She just couldn't handle that I was more popular, so she tried to stop me.
She even threatened to tell Alex, as if she could ever turn him against me.
Really?
Did she try to talk to you about that?
Of course.
But the problem with Colleen was she never really understood her place.
Is that why you went to her apartment?
To remind her?
Because from what I've heard, you were not the only person who felt that Colleen didn't understand her place at Benford.
She's not one of us.
She works for us.
It's crazy.
It's almost as if she was trying to destroy everything that you've worked for.
Oh, I warned her that.
I mean, I tried to reason with her.
I'm usually really good at that, okay?
But she just wouldn't back down.
She slapped me, so I hit her back.
I've never hit anyone before.
I've never used a knife like that.
I just kept thinking, "she's gonna ruin everything!"
And there was no way I could let that happen -- not from someone like her.
I couldn't stop.
Then she was quiet.
Too bad you can't use any of that.
Well, actually, I can use all of it.
What don't you understand?
I'm a minor.
No, it's what you don't understand.
Now, I didn't go to Yale, but I'm pretty sure you just confessed to murder, and I'm a little disappointed that you didn't know this.
But, by law, there is no assumption of privacy in a police car, not even for a minor.
So I just, uh -
- I tape-recorded everything you said.
Let's see your daddy get you out of that.
Thanks.
Peace offering.
Hey.
Didn't know we were at war.
[ Clears throat ] [ Glasses clink ]
A couple of weeks ago, Lieutenant Valdez asked me if there was some patrol cops that I thought were real up-and-comers.
Oh, so it's your fault I got promoted.
Yeah, you have a very funny way of phrasing that, but, yeah.
Yeah, I thought I was doing you a solid.
Um, you can always go back to patrol, you know.
Mm.
Not without chatting the L.T.
Well, maybe someday you will explain to me what's so terrible about getting a bump.
But just so you know,
I really like seeing you around the office.
And...
Uh, I think you have the goods to be a really great detective.
Buerge:
Happy first solved murder, rookie!
Hear, hear.
Oh, I don't know what you guys are toasting me for.
I did nothing to solve this case.
That's not true.
You picked up my laundry, got my car washed.
[ Both laugh ]
Hey, in honor of your first case...
[ Laughter ]
You want to grow up and be a real detective like me, you got to learn to dress the part.
Hey, hon, another round for the team.
And, uh, give this slick-lookin' dude the bill.
Hey.
Hey, newbies buy.
It's tradition.
That's right!
That's right!
[ Laughs ] All right.
Hey, uh, next weekend, we're gonna take a test for a different school.
Nicholas:
Okay.
It's no big deal, you know.
You don't need to worry about it or anything.
We're just gonna...
We're just gonna explore our options, okay?
Do what's best for you.
Sure.
Honey, you're a smart boy, you know?
You need to be challenged at school.
You shouldn't be bored.
So this may mean that you stay at your school or, you know, you may go to a different school, so...
Okay.
The most important thing to me is that you're happy.
I am.
Good.
The standardized tests?
They're totally easy.
Well, for you, maybe.
For anyone.
You just need a strategy.
A strategy.
Mom, you know the bubbles you fill in?
Mm-hmm.
As you go down the page, you just have to make them go back and forth.
Sort of like a Christmas tree.
A Christmas tree.
Of course.
Nick, you're a genius.
Yep.

Dulcett:
The victim -- Colleen Emily Watkins. 32.
How many times was she stabbed?
Four or five.
There's some defensive cuts on her hands and arms.
Neighbor saw the door ajar this morning, called 911.
Her skin color, dried blood --
I'm figuring she died sometime last night, and I didn't see any pry marks on the door, so no forced entry.
Yeah, we add that to the little robe, she probably knew the killer, huh?
Crime of passion.
Do we know where she worked?
She was a college advisor at a place called Benford Academy.
Oh.
Fancy.
Heard of it?
[ Cellphone rings ]
Yeah, you know, it's that big place up on Mulholland.
The tuition's like half our salary.
Fools and their money.
Oh, it's home.
Uh...
Go, go, go.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello, hello?
Nicholas:
Hey, mom.
What you doing?
Hi, sweetie.
I'm working.
What are you doing?
Okay, well, I think I finally got it.
I've been practicing with Uncle Davey.
Let me hear it.
[ Off-key Tarzan yell ]
It's better, right?
Yeah, that's -- that's really good, sweetie.
You know what?
You just got to -- you just got to really lean into that yodel, you know?
It's more like...
[ Tarzan yell ]
You know, like that.
You know?
Tell you what -- why don't you practice it some more, and I will listen to you when I get home tonight, okay?
I got to get back to work.
I love you, Nick.
All right, bye.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Sorry.
[ Chuckles ]
You know, you would think that someone who worked at a school like Benford would live in a swankier place.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Her bedroom closet is packed with designer clothes and shoes.
I don't know.
Maybe she was living beneath her means so she could dress to impress at the school.
That makes sense.
Uh, bed looks like she had company.
They're gonna do a rape kit, see if she had sex, and swab for DNA.
We'll know more soon.
We find the phone yet?
Not yet, but I'll get a data dump from the phone company.
Might take a few days.
Here -- her online calendar shows the victim booked from 10:00 to 4:00 yesterday, all first names.
Yeah, it's probably students.
We can check them against the school roster.
Did you find anything on her e-mails?
Eh, it's password-protected.
Hey, can you see what you can get off this?
Thanks.
Oh!
Is it Halloween?
'Cause there's some dude in here dressed like a TV detective.
- Did you lose a bet, officer?
- Yeah, in a way.
I got a call from Lieutenant Valdez last night to report to R.H.D. this morning.
I'm on loan as a detective.
Detective Rush.
That sounds pretty good.
Yeah.
So, why are you acting like you just got kicked down to traffic?
I like to make my own decisions.
I busted my butt for 10 years to break into R.H.D.
They're power-shooting you in, and you're complaining?
Look, it might be all right.
I'll give it some time.
Got to see how much I like all this standing around and chatting.
Oh.
Well, you better hope that's all you have to do 'cause you're not chasing anyone down in those Jimmy Choo's.
[ Chuckles ]
As I told this handsome man, um, Colleen's door was ajar when I got my paper.
That's not like her.
So I knocked and looked in and, uh, saw her on the floor, called 911.
Were you close to Miss Watkins?
Neighborly.
She was a sweet girl.
Looked after my cats when I went away.
Her boyfriend's nice, too.
Do you know the boyfriend's name?
No, but he's around all the time.
He works for that delivery company -- you know, the one with the shorts.
I know it well.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, thanks very much for your help.
Detective, what do you say you track down the boyfriend, see if you can bring him in?
You got it.
You and I will head over to the school.
Mm-hmm.
O'Dell:
You know, we pride ourselves on preparing the kids to go out into the real world, as if it's something beyond this campus.
Alas, today's a harsh reminder that it's everywhere.
Headmaster O'Dell, it's our understanding that Colleen Watkins was the college adviser here?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Applying to colleges is different than it was when we were kids.
It's a full-time job.
And it's Alex.
Everyone here just calls me Alex.
And Colleen directed students to the right schools?
Oh, yes, and she was excellent at it.
Benford parents expect their children to attend very selective colleges.
Well, since Colleen's been with us, acceptance rates at the Ivys have skyrocketed.
Her death is a terrible loss for the school.
Alas...
Did you know if she was seeing anyone?
Oh, I try to keep things professional with my staff.
It just simplifies things.
Some of her colleagues may know.
I can arrange for you to meet with them, if you like.
Thank you.
We also have a list of students she met with yesterday.
We're trying to understand her state of mind before she died.
Sure.
[ School bell rings ]
Have you ever met any of her family or friends who didn't work here?
I know she had a boyfriend, but I never met him.
I think he travels a lot.
I don't know if it's what you're looking for, but Colleen usually had a salad for lunch.
She found me this great internship reading to blind people.
Colleges love that kind of stuff.
Makes you seem really charitable.
Colleen played tennis as an undergrad, and so do I.
Texas State something.
She also helped me get my S.A.T.s into shape.
She was...
I think she came from money.
She spent a fortune on clothes.
Everybody knew bits and pieces, but it doesn't seem like she had any close friends.
No one had ever been to her apartment, and none of them had ever met her truck-driving boyfriend.
Well, it makes sense if she was trying to move up in the world.
Neither her boyfriend nor her apartment come off as Benford material.
[ Cellphone rings ] Oh, excuse me.
Sheppard.
Yeah.
Okay, great.
Great.
Romeo picked up the boyfriend.
Guy named Timothy Kane.
He's taking him downtown.
[ Siren walls ]
They wouldn't tell me how she was killed.
I just want to know what happened.
Gloria:
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
How long had you and Colleen been dating?
We weren't.
We broke up about three weeks ago.
But before that, we'd been together for... about six months.
Why'd you break up?
Different priorities.
I make pretty good money, but I wear shorts to work, you know?
That was never gonna be enough for Colleen.
When's the last time you saw her?
About three weeks ago, the night we broke up.
Detective Rush told me that you...
Transferred to a different delivery route.
Yeah, I got to know Colleen because she orders so much stuff online.
Um...
last thing I wanted after we broke up was to see her name on my delivery list every day.
So you still had feelings for her.
I didn't kill her, if -- if that's what you're asking.
No, that's not what I'm asking.
But I'm glad to hear you say that, so I can assume that you won't mind if we swab for DNA?
Where were you last night?
My shift ended around 10:00, and I went out for a beer with some of the guys.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Nice job tracking down the boyfriend.
Now, if you wouldn't mind checking out his alibi...
[ Sighs ]
Hey, Romeo, this is the job.
[ Chuckles ]
It's connect the dots.
It's chasing down a thousand little details that might bust open a case.
I know.
I get it.
Colleen Watkins has a sister way out in Apple Valley.
Local P.D. is driving out to give her the bad news.
Buerge:
Is this the new guy?
Ah.
Ramon, this is Ted Buerge.
I'm sure you guys have lots to talk about.
L.T.'s been chatting you up.
But -- hoo!
Didn't mention the dancing shoes.
They call you Romeo, right?
Uh, Ramon Rush, patrol.
I'm on loan to you guys as a detective.
Ah.
I love new guys.
[ Chuckles ]
I got to be in court today with Van Stone.
Pick up my shirts for me, okay, handsome?
It's just a game.
Do we like the ex-boyfriend as the doer?
He has motive, but we're checking out his alibi.
S.I.D. got into Colleen Watkins' e-mail account.
She's been receiving steamy messages for the last month or so.
Well, that would fit the timeline.
She broke up with her boyfriend about -- what?
-
- Three weeks ago.
You got a name?
Yeah, I do.
And if either of you recognize it, let me know.
His name is smoothloverx.
Now, it's a hotmail account, so we don't have a name, but I can read you one of his e-mails.
Oh, whoa.
That's not necessary.
"Dearest Colleen, your touch has unleashed the lion in me."
Okay, I think we --
"My days are spent in reverie, imagining the next time your mouth, your tongue --"
okay, you know, I get it.
Uh, wait a minute.
"Your breath is on my skin.
"That we must be discreet,
"that I can't shout your name from the rooftop,
"tears my soul asunder.
Alas --" Okay, who says "asunder"?
The same guy who says "alas."
O'Dell, the headmaster.
So Colleen Watkins was sleeping with her boss.
Yes.
And her boss calls himself smoothloverx.
Ew!
Ew!
Gloria:
So, you lied to us.
You were having an affair with Colleen Watkins.
Smoothloverx.
Those are personal.
Yes, and they were florid and fraught with cliché.
Do you write notes like that to the missus?
Look, I-I liked Colleen, I had fun with her, but I never had any intention of leaving my wife.
Did she know that?
Yes, Colleen was aware of my situation.
Well let's see if I can understand your situation.
You knew how important it was for Colleen to be at Benford, so you used your power and your position to seduce her.
And then when you got tired of the arrangement, you --
I didn't kill her.
Where were you last night?
I was in my office, at school, writing a speech for alumni weekend.
I was there till 11:00.
And did anyone see you there?
No.
Hmm.
Where was your wife?
Um, she -- she was at a board meeting.
She got home after I did.
And when we talk to her, she'll be able to tell us the same thing.
I didn't kill Colleen.
We'll need to take some prints and collect some DNA.
Is there, uh, any way of keeping this quiet?
Benford can't really afford any more bad publicity.
What do you mean "any more"?
A family sued the school after their son was rejected from Dartmouth.
Th-the lawsuit named Colleen as a defendant.
The case was dismissed, but the school's still recovering.
Alas...
Alas, a lawsuit and an affair.
Any other grenades you'd like to throw into the fire?
- Does the school get sued a lot?
- No.
No, b-but families like the Delgados expect us to work miracles.
If you're looking for someone with an ax to grind against Colleen, I'd look at them.
[ Cellphone rings ]
Hang on.
Sheppard.
Yes, this is she.
Oh, well, what did he do?
Yeah, I can do that.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Nick's principal wants to see me.
She say why?
No, she just said she wants to see me.
Today.
Patrick's an amazing kid, and we spent every dime that we have to send him to Benford.
Yeah, then he was rejected from Dartmouth -- early decision.
Another boy from his class got in, a boy with lower grades.
But his parents gave money to Benford for a new gym.
So you think that Colleen was giving this rich kid preferential treatment.
They talk a good game about scholarship and diversity.
But at the end of the day, we were never accepted.
So, where were you two last night?
Here, with Patrick.
We had a late shipment.
And we didn't get home until midnight.
Check the security tapes, if you want.
It's all there.
- Tell me you're not saying anything crazy.
- Patrick!
No, for the zillionth time, I told you it wasn't
Colleen's fault that Dartmouth didn't want me.
She did everything she could to help.
I just didn't have what it takes.
I don't see them doing this.
Hey, 'Chelle, did their son, Patrick -- did he seem kind of anxious to you?
He seemed embarrassed by the whole thing.
No, it was more than that.
It was like he was agitated.
I'll have a uniform come back for all the security tapes.
Hopefully, Patrick is in them with his parents.
You know, they -- they spent everything to send their kid to this school, and they just looked miserable.
Yeah, well, you know, it's tough.
You always want the best for your kids.
Yeah, well, we didn't go to Ivy League schools.
State colleges worked pretty good for you and me.
Good job, good money, solid benefits.
Oh, yeah.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
I'd die without the dental.
I got this genetic plaque thing, and it's like it takes, like, an ice pick to get that stuff out of there.
Yeah, not that I don't love your dental horror stories...
Excuse me.
Okay.
[ Sighs ]
Okay, thanks.
Thanks.
Coroner's report just came in.
They confirmed Colleen Watkins died around 9:00 last night from her knife wounds.
They also said that she had intercourse, but her partner used a condom, so DNA is a long shot.
Hey, Nick, how was school today?
Nicholas:
You know, school.
Anything special happen?
Nope.
All right, Nick, why is the principal calling me, huh?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
Look, let me talk to Uncle Davey.
Uncle Davey's in the shower.
Mom, I really can't talk right now.
Leo and I are doing a science project.
For school?
For fun.
Bye.
[ Phone thuds ]
He must have done something really bad.
Are you ready?
3, 2, 1.
Start the timer.
[ Timer ticking ]
What about the family with the nursery?
Well, they were upset but not insanely so.
Their son seemed jumpy, so we're checking out his alibi, as well as theirs.
This was a crime of passion, and there's plenty of passion to go around.
The ex, Tim Kane, was kicked to the curb because Colleen was embarrassed of him, and Alex O'Dell was cheating on his wife.
And how are the alibis on those two?
Well, Rush is tracking the ex's delivery schedule, and O'Dell didn't have one.
We're bringing his wife in to see if she knew about the affair.
Curious to see just how passionate she was about her marriage.
Any physical evidence?
The knife was wiped clean, and whoever she had sex with used a condom, so...
Did you get anything else off the victim's computer?
Just that the girl loved to shop.
I mean, there are a few third-party web addresses that S.I.D. is still trying to crack.
Uh, Mrs. O'Dell is here.
Nice shoes, detective.
It's good to see someone take a little pride in their appearance around here.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna head out.
Mrs. O'Dell, how long had you known that your husband was having an affair with Colleen Watkins?
Almost from the get-go.
Alexander's not really capable of keeping a secret from me.
And you never felt that the affair would threaten your marriage?
My husband and I connect on many levels, but romance isn't one of them.
We each have our own special friends for that, and we're fine with it.
You know, I noticed at the school that a number of the girls were quite taken with him.
Do you think that your husband would ever become involved with one of his students?
He's always getting poems and flowers and cards, but he'd never risk crossing that line.
He enjoys his job too much.
Why have the devotion of just one when he can be adored by them all?
Hmm.
I just spoke with the victim's sister.
She said Tim Kane went all stalker on Colleen after she broke up with him -- waiting for her at apartment, following her to school, begging for a second chance.
This all fits with what Romeo found out.
Yeah, something wasn't making sense when I tracked the ex-boyfriend's delivery schedule, so I talked to the guy who took over his old route.
The guy was supposed to deliver a package to Colleen.
The ex took it and told him he was going over to her house anyway.
The victim signed for the package at 8:14.
The ex returned the truck at 10:06.
But Colleen's apartment is only a 20-minute drive.
So that puts an angry ex-boyfriend in her apartment delivering a package less than an hour before the murder.
Colleen signed for a package that you delivered at 8:14, an hour before she was dead.
Okay, you've been stalking her all hours of the night, and you expect us to believe that you were not involved?
I never touched her.
So you didn't have sex with her.
I didn't kill her.
She was upset.
I-I-I could tell as soon as she opened the door that she'd been crying.
- Did she explain why?
- No, no.
She just...hugged me.
And then you had sex with her.
Yeah.
I mean no.
No, not right away, no.
It wasn't -- it wasn't like that.
Colleen initiated, not me.
Well, that must have been very confusing for you, what with all the feelings you still had for her.
Is that the first time that you'd been intimate with Colleen since the breakup?
So you must have thought that you had a chance at getting back together with her, huh?
Yeah.
I thought I had a shot.
But she told you you didn't.
No, I'm just another embarrassing thing in her rearview mirror, like her family's farm or the little state college she went to in Texas.
God forbid anybody at Benford ever hear anything about me.
I couldn't get her where she wanted to go.
Maybe that's why she had an affair with somebody at Benford.
You didn't know about that.
[ Scoffs ]
No, but it explains a lot.
So, then, that's -- that's why she was crying when I dropped off the package, right?
Some other dude.
Hey, this package -- do you happen to know where it was in the apartment?
The kitchen counter, maybe.
Any idea what was in it?
Shoes, clothes, shampoo --
Colleen ordered her whole life online.
All right.
Sit tight.
You're not going anywhere.
Well, he's big enough and hurt enough.
Plus, he got double-dumped.
For 17 minutes, he thought that they were back together.
17?
With an ex, you're lucky to get 12.
Well, somebody has a digital clock in their bedroom.
Hey, I get sex with an ex.
There's no instruction manuals, there's no surprises, and it definitely does not raise the number.
Yeah, but it's still tricky, you know?
One person's always more invested than the other, you know?
Hey, I don't remember seeing a package at Colleen's apartment.
You?
No, and I stood right next to the counter.
I wonder what happened to it.
Hey, you know what?
I got to go.
I got to get to Nick's school for that meeting with the principal.
Okay, and I'll put the ex on ice for the night.
There's enough to hold him.
On the way home, I'll stop by Colleen's apartment, see if I can find that package.
All right.
Wish me luck.
What you doing?
Going over these delivery records for Dulcett on the Colleen Watkins' case.
Ain't cop work a hoot?
[ Chuckles ]
Uh, lieutenant has a task for you.
Yeah, as soon as I'm finished with this --
L.T. needs it asap.
He takes priority.
Need you to dig up a file -- last name Maines, first name Myra.
It's personal.
On the D.L.
Don't just leave it on his desk.
Make sure you put it in his hand.
Mack, Madden, Mahoney...
Maines.
Hey, I've got a file for the lieutenant.
Oh, I'll take it.
Oh, I'm supposed to put it directly in his hands.
Uh, any idea where he went?
He headed toward reception.
Hey, have you seen the L.T.?
No.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey, lieutenant...
[ Breathing heavily ] ...heard you were looking for Myra Maines.
"My remains"?
Buerge, right?
Yeah.
That file's been suckering rookies for a hundred years.
You know how I'd get even?
Pizzas.
Like 20 of them in his name.
Why don't you put that back for the next guy?
Welcome aboard, detective.
[ Sighs ]
Hey, Buerge.
Hey.
Hey, I gave the lieutenant the file.
He thought it was a riot.
Don't even think about getting me back.
I've heard it all.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Just so you know, women throw themselves at me everywhere I go.
Mm.
At the car wash, the supermarket, even the dry-cleaners.
It's insane how much tail I get.
Damn it.
You win.
How's it going?
Damn it!
[ School bell rings ]
Nick's always had a ton of energy.
You know, he probably gets that from me.
I'm always saying, you know,
"Nick, use your powers for good, not evil," you know?
Not -- not that he's evil, you know what I mean?
Not, like, stuff that I've seen, of course.
Mrs. Sheppard, Nick's not in trouble.
He -- what?
That's not why you're here.
Oh, good.
Um...
Really?
Just the opposite, in fact.
Um, your son received the highest scores in this school's history on the G.S.E.
My Nick?
You should be very proud.
But he's always saying that school is so boring.
No offense.
None taken.
That's not uncommon with really bright children.
The work doesn't challenge them, so they tune out.
Wow.
It's just, um...
It's amazing.
Well, is there some extra stuff that he should be doing, like...
Spelling words or --
That's why I wanted you to come in.
As much as we would love to keep Nick here at our school,
I'm not sure we have the resources he needs.
You just lost me.
What?
Nick needs to be surrounded by peers of his intelligence level.
If I were you, I would check into some of the more academic private schools.
I mean, how is this even possible, you know?
I mean, I'm his mom and a detective.
How could I have missed this?
Genius.
Really?
It's just...
He's pretty diabolical in DD.
Yeah, but, you know,
I expect Nick to be that kind of genius, okay?
That kind of genius I can handle.
But what am I supposed to do with this one, you know?
The real kind -- you know, the kind that has to go to private schools and have tutors and cellos and -- Cellos?
Well, for instance, you know?
Look, I mean, part of the reason you guys came out here was because the schools were better.
Maybe you sensed his need.
Maybe.
I don't know, though, Davey.
You know what?
I was at a private school today, and, I mean, the grounds were just gorgeous, right?
The campus was beautiful.
They had all the resources money could buy.
But the kids there, they just -- they didn't seem like kids, you know?
And I don't know.
I mean, is that what we want for Nick?
Do we want to put him into that kind of an environment and...
I don't know.
Nick tends to roll with the program.
You sure you're not worried about how you'd fit in?
Well, I wouldn't.
I mean, I already know that.
But, then again, it's not like I'm a perfect fit in the school he's at now, you know?
I mean, there aren't too many other parents carrying firearms or showing up at parent-teacher conferences with a tranny hooker cuffed in the backseat.
Sad but true.
You know what?
The bottom line is that I am just gonna have to do the very best that I can for Nick...
The genius.
You know, you and your ex are both very smart people.
It's entirely possible that your kids are even smarter.
Ooh.
Well, maybe.
I don't know.
Let me clean this up.
Got a towel?
[ Cellphone rings ]
Hang on.
I'll get the phone.
Hey, 'Chelle.
Dulcett:
Hey.
So, I went back to Colleen's apartment and I double-checked with S.I.D.
There was no package at the apartment or in the trash.
You know what?
Maybe we're asking the wrong question.
Maybe we should be trying to figure out what was in the package, and then we can figure out who took it.
Okay, I'll have S.I.D. track the sender's I.S.P.
Through the delivery company in the morning.
You know what?
I'm gonna head by Benford in the morning.
There was this girl that I talked to this morning, and -- and she knew about Colleen's days as an undergrad in Texas.
Now, if Colleen was embarrassed of her past, why is she telling this kid anything?
Hey, hey, give me a kiss.
[ Smooches ]
That's a good question.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, no, I know.
Okay.
All right, see you then.
Bye.
[ Bread smacks ]
Nick!
- Hey, how was your first day of school?
- Hey.
Well, I, uh...
Picked up Buerge's dry-cleaning.
I tracked down a delivery truck, and chased about a dozen stupid little details that are probably gonna go nowhere.
Yeah.
That sounds about right.
Not for me.
Why?
'Cause every day on the streets is a shoot-'em-up rodeo?
No, of course not, but --
You know what?
I don't know what this is really all about, but you are messing it up.
I don't remember asking your opinion.
You are looking at a chance to work in one of the best detective divisions in the world.
I waited 10 years for my shot, and for whatever reason,
Valdez is reaching out and offering you a shortcut --
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
No, no, no.
I caught every word.
[ Sighs ]
If you can't recognize an opportunity... then maybe you should go back to patrol.
[ Sighs ]
Nick?
I told you to go to bed.
No, you did not.
Good night, Nick!
He's going up right now.
Yeah, show me the computer.
It's nothing.
It's just a little thing that we were...
It's like math.
What do you mean it's like math?
You'll overreact.
No, I won't.
Give me the computer.
Mom, I won 50 bucks, right?
50 bucks.
That's great.
What?
Give me the computer.
Give it to me.
What do you mean you won fif--
Blackjack?
Davey?
Really?
Uh, am I in trouble?
No.
Can I keep the money?
No way.
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
What?
Are you kidding me, man?
Online gambling?
What are you doing?
He's 11.
I'm sorry.
- How good is he?
- Really good.
Really?
Yeah.
He split a pair of aces, and he caught two Queens.
What is that?
50 bucks.
Hmm.
I was looking at private schools today.
We're gonna need a whole lot more than 50 bucks.
Nick!
Stop it.
That's not funny.
[ Laughs ]
You're such a -- [ Laughs ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Excuse me.
It's Madison, isn't it?
Yeah.
You have a good memory.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Colleen.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, walk me to class?
Sure.
Madison, how did you know that Colleen did her undergrad in Texas?
Oh, she told me.
We talked about all kinds of things when we worked together.
That happens a lot.
People confide in me.
Oh.
Well, that's wonderful.
I also noticed that you were very close to headmaster O'Dell the other day.
It's great that you have such a strong support network.
Still, it's got to be a lot for you, you know, losing your college adviser in the middle of the year.
It's not easy, but I try not to let it slow me down.
Yeah, well, still, you wouldn't be normal if it didn't set you back a bit.
Not my favorite word.
"Normal" might be okay for your job, but it's not going to get me into Yale.
That's what Colleen was helping me with -- focus.
When I mentioned headmaster O'Dell, you seemed uncomfortable.
Not really.
When I saw the two of you talking back there, he seemed upset with you.
Madison, if this has anything to do with Colleen, you should really tell me.
I couldn't tell you anything yesterday, not with Alex there.
After my appointment with Colleen the other day,
I went to the gym to get my tennis bag.
I don't know if this is hearsay or admissible, and I don't want to be a tattling bitch.
No one thinks that.
I saw Colleen arguing with Alex.
She was begging him to leave his wife.
He said that there was no way, but she was hysterical, and he was really, really angry.
Well, thank you for telling me.
Let's, uh, get you to class.
What do you have on the Colleen Watkins case?
Gloria:
We got a lot.
There's this girl, a student at Benford -- she's got a serious crush on the headmaster.
Anyway, she said that she saw him and Colleen arguing the day of the murder.
How is his alibi?
Nonexistent.
His wife's alibi does check out, though.
They both lawyered up.
We're still holding the ex because we've established that he was with Colleen around the time of the murder.
That is a lot.
Yeah.
Any word on the missing package?
'Chelle's having S.I.D. track the online shipping company.
We're trying to figure out what was inside.
You think the contents will clarify things?
Maybe, yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Your kids, they go to private schools, right?
Yeah.
It was my ex's idea.
Which one?
First and second.
Why?
Well, Nick, my eldest, he aced this test, and his principal thinks that we should send him to a better school.
Um...
So, anyway, I started looking online, and --
They all cost a fortune.
Yeah, I just don't see how I can afford it, unless I start knocking over liquor stores on the side.
I try not to think about the boat
I could have bought with all that money -
- Catalina 47.
You could sail it around the world if you want.
But most days, my kids love their school, and they're doing real well, so it's worth it.
Yeah, well...
[ Knock on door ]
Found what was in the package.
Adderall.
Lots of Adderall.
Colleen had prescriptions from three different online pharmacies.
She was getting almost 100 pills a month.
There's no way in hell this is for A.D.D.
Hey, what if she was pushing it on the kids?
I mean, at the Delgados' yesterday, their son said that Colleen did everything that she could to help him.
What if that included selling him Adderall?
Yeah, well, it would explain why he was so agitated.
You know, a lot of these kids abuse this drug because they think it's gonna raise their I.Q.
Yeah, they're morons for thinking that.
Only thing it will raise is their blood pressure, cause a stroke.
Let's go talk to Patrick Delgado.
Yep.
You were on Colleen's calendar twice in the last month.
Now, don't you think that's a little odd given that your parents sued her?
[ Sighs ] I guess.
Maybe.
We checked with your teachers.
The dates you saw her were right before you had big exams.
Was Colleen selling Adderall to you to help you study?
No.
Patrick, look -- you're 18 years old.
We don't need your parents' permission to take you downtown.
She wasn't selling it.
What, she gave it to you out of the kindness of her heart?
[ Sighs ]
Colleen was more like a trainer for a sports team -- always careful about how she dosed us.
Only gave us the pills before a big exam to help us focus.
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?
You wanted to take it more often.
Thought it would make you smarter.
I told Colleen I'd even buy them from her.
She wouldn't do it.
So what'd you do?
Found another source.
Total bitch but fewer rules.
Are you talking about Madison?
Maybe.
I know my rights.
They need a warrant to search my locker.
Alex, please tell them they can't do this.
Look, I'm sorry, detectives, but Madison's right.
There is no way I can allow you to do this on school property without a search warrant.
We really need a warrant?
Well, I have to protect my students.
Well, we can get a warrant, can't we, 'Chelle?
Yeah, a couple hours, yeah.
Just know that, when we do come back, we'll bring about a dozen black-and-whites, sirens blaring, and we may even call in a helicopter so none of the neighbors miss out on any of the action.
Unless, of course, you think that might bring more bad publicity to the school.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
Hey, my father's gonna sue you both.
How could you?
I'm so sorry.
Hey, none of you can look in there without my permission!
Back up.
I have rights!
Yeah, you do have rights...
Like remaining silent.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say or do will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be appointed for you.
Do you understand the rights as I have said them to you?
I'm going to take Madison down to R.H.D.
Your parents know that we're going there and that we're charging you with possessing and selling narcotics.
My dad's a lawyer.
Yeah, you've said that already.
I'm sure he's gonna be really happy with your new career move.
Didn't know they could arrest somebody for being a bitch.
That kid was out of line.
He didn't think I was a bitch when he needed something.
You mean drugs?
You can't trick me into talking.
And even if you could, it wouldn't matter.
You're not allowed to interrogate me without my parents or a lawyer present.
I see.
Well, get in the car.
[ Sighs ]
[ Car door closes, engine turns over ]
I know my rights.
I can say anything to you, and it's inadmissible in court.
Sounds like you know the rules.
It's, like, the only advantage to being a minor.
I understand.
Doubt it.
You have no idea what it's like to be me.
Perfect S.A.T.s, captain of the tennis team, and yet there's still no guarantee I'll get into Yale.
I couldn't have handled that when I was your age.
Most people can't.
But you're so smart.
Why deal drugs?
You don't need the money.
You're not listening.
My dad's a really good lawyer.
God, you sound just like Colleen.
Colleen knew you were dealing?
Most of her advisees started buying from me because I didn't have any stupid rules.
She just couldn't handle that I was more popular, so she tried to stop me.
She even threatened to tell Alex, as if she could ever turn him against me.
Really?
Did she try to talk to you about that?
Of course.
But the problem with Colleen was she never really understood her place.
Is that why you went to her apartment?
To remind her?
Because from what I've heard, you were not the only person who felt that Colleen didn't understand her place at Benford.
She's not one of us.
She works for us.
It's crazy.
It's almost as if she was trying to destroy everything that you've worked for.
Oh, I warned her that.
I mean, I tried to reason with her.
I'm usually really good at that, okay?
But she just wouldn't back down.
She slapped me, so I hit her back.
I've never hit anyone before.
I've never used a knife like that.
I just kept thinking, "she's gonna ruin everything!"
And there was no way I could let that happen -- not from someone like her.
I couldn't stop.
Then she was quiet.
Too bad you can't use any of that.
Well, actually, I can use all of it.
What don't you understand?
I'm a minor.
No, it's what you don't understand.
Now, I didn't go to Yale, but I'm pretty sure you just confessed to murder, and I'm a little disappointed that you didn't know this.
But, by law, there is no assumption of privacy in a police car, not even for a minor.
So I just, uh -
- I tape-recorded everything you said.
Let's see your daddy get you out of that.
Thanks.
Peace offering.
Hey.
Didn't know we were at war.
[ Clears throat ] [ Glasses clink ]
A couple of weeks ago, Lieutenant Valdez asked me if there was some patrol cops that I thought were real up-and-comers.
Oh, so it's your fault I got promoted.
Yeah, you have a very funny way of phrasing that, but, yeah.
Yeah, I thought I was doing you a solid.
Um, you can always go back to patrol, you know.
Mm.
Not without chatting the L.T.
Well, maybe someday you will explain to me what's so terrible about getting a bump.
But just so you know,
I really like seeing you around the office.
And...
Uh, I think you have the goods to be a really great detective.
Buerge:
Happy first solved murder, rookie!
Hear, hear.
Oh, I don't know what you guys are toasting me for.
I did nothing to solve this case.
That's not true.
You picked up my laundry, got my car washed.
[ Both laugh ]
Hey, in honor of your first case...
[ Laughter ]
You want to grow up and be a real detective like me, you got to learn to dress the part.
Hey, hon, another round for the team.
And, uh, give this slick-lookin' dude the bill.
Hey.
Hey, newbies buy.
It's tradition.
That's right!
That's right!
[ Laughs ] All right.
Hey, uh, next weekend, we're gonna take a test for a different school.
Nicholas:
Okay.
It's no big deal, you know.
You don't need to worry about it or anything.
We're just gonna...
We're just gonna explore our options, okay?
Do what's best for you.
Sure.
Honey, you're a smart boy, you know?
You need to be challenged at school.
You shouldn't be bored.
So this may mean that you stay at your school or, you know, you may go to a different school, so...
Okay.
The most important thing to me is that you're happy.
I am.
Good.
The standardized tests?
They're totally easy.
Well, for you, maybe.
For anyone.
You just need a strategy.
A strategy.
Mom, you know the bubbles you fill in?
Mm-hmm.
As you go down the page, you just have to make them go back and forth.
Sort of like a Christmas tree.
A Christmas tree.
Of course.
Nick, you're a genius.
Yep.

== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The victim -- Colleen Emily Watkins. 32.
How many times was she stabbed?
Four or five.
There's some defensive cuts on her hands and arms.
Neighbor saw the door ajar this morning, called 911.
Her skin color, dried blood --
I'm figuring she died sometime last night, and I didn't see any pry marks on the door, so no forced entry.
Yeah, we add that to the little robe, she probably knew the killer, huh?
Crime of passion.
Do we know where she worked?
She was a college advisor at a place called Benford Academy.
Oh.
Fancy.
Heard of it?
Yeah, you know, it's that big place up on Mulholland.
The tuition's like half our salary.
Fools and their money.
Oh, it's home.
Uh...
Go, go, go.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello, hello?
Hey, mom.
What you doing?
Hi, sweetie.
I'm working.
What are you doing?
Okay, well, I think I finally got it.
I've been practicing with Uncle Davey.
Let me hear it.
It's better, right?
Yeah, that's -- that's really good, sweetie.
You know what?
You just got to -- you just got to really lean into that yodel, you know?
It's more like...
You know, like that.
You know?
Tell you what -- why don't you practice it some more, and I will listen to you when I get home tonight, okay?
I got to get back to work.
I love you, Nick.
All right, bye.
Sorry.
You know, you would think that someone who worked at a school like Benford would live in a swankier place.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Her bedroom closet is packed with designer clothes and shoes.
I don't know.
Maybe she was living beneath her means so she could dress to impress at the school.
That makes sense.
Uh, bed looks like she had company.
They're gonna do a rape kit, see if she had sex, and swab for DNA.
We'll know more soon.
We find the phone yet?
Not yet, but I'll get a data dump from the phone company.
Might take a few days.
Here -- her online calendar shows the victim booked from 10:00 to 4:00 yesterday, all first names.
Yeah, it's probably students.
We can check them against the school roster.
Did you find anything on her e-mails?
Eh, it's password-protected.
Hey, can you see what you can get off this?
Thanks.
Oh!
Is it Halloween?
'Cause there's some dude in here dressed like a TV detective.
- Did you lose a bet, officer?
- Yeah, in a way.
I got a call from Lieutenant Valdez last night to report to R.H.D. this morning.
I'm on loan as a detective.
Detective Rush.
That sounds pretty good.
Yeah.
So, why are you acting like you just got kicked down to traffic?
I like to make my own decisions.
I busted my butt for 10 years to break into R.H.D.
They're power-shooting you in, and you're complaining?
Look, it might be all right.
I'll give it some time.
Got to see how much I like all this standing around and chatting.
Oh.
Well, you better hope that's all you have to do 'cause you're not chasing anyone down in those Jimmy Choo's.
As I told this handsome man, um, Colleen's door was ajar when I got my paper.
That's not like her.
So I knocked and looked in and, uh, saw her on the floor, called 911.
Were you close to Miss Watkins?
Neighborly.
She was a sweet girl.
Looked after my cats when I went away.
Her boyfriend's nice, too.
Do you know the boyfriend's name?
No, but he's around all the time.
He works for that delivery company -- you know, the one with the shorts.
I know it well.
Well, thanks very much for your help.
Detective, what do you say you track down the boyfriend, see if you can bring him in?
You got it.
You and I will head over to the school.
Mm-hmm.
You know, we pride ourselves on preparing the kids to go out into the real world, as if it's something beyond this campus.
Alas, today's a harsh reminder that it's everywhere.
Headmaster O'Dell, it's our understanding that Colleen Watkins was the college adviser here?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Applying to colleges is different than it was when we were kids.
It's a full-time job.
And it's Alex.
Everyone here just calls me Alex.
And Colleen directed students to the right schools?
Oh, yes, and she was excellent at it.
Benford parents expect their children to attend very selective colleges.
Well, since Colleen's been with us, acceptance rates at the Ivys have skyrocketed.
Her death is a terrible loss for the school.
Alas...
Did you know if she was seeing anyone?
Oh, I try to keep things professional with my staff.
It just simplifies things.
Some of her colleagues may know.
I can arrange for you to meet with them, if you like.
Thank you.
We also have a list of students she met with yesterday.
We're trying to understand her state of mind before she died.
Sure.
Have you ever met any of her family or friends who didn't work here?
I know she had a boyfriend, but I never met him.
I think he travels a lot.
I don't know if it's what you're looking for, but Colleen usually had a salad for lunch.
She found me this great internship reading to blind people.
Colleges love that kind of stuff.
Makes you seem really charitable.
Colleen played tennis as an undergrad, and so do I.
Texas State something.
She also helped me get my S.A.T.s into shape.
She was...
I think she came from money.
She spent a fortune on clothes.
Everybody knew bits and pieces, but it doesn't seem like she had any close friends.
No one had ever been to her apartment, and none of them had ever met her truck-driving boyfriend.
Well, it makes sense if she was trying to move up in the world.
Neither her boyfriend nor her apartment come off as Benford material.
Oh, excuse me.
Sheppard.
Yeah.
Okay, great.
Great.
Romeo picked up the boyfriend.
Guy named Timothy Kane.
He's taking him downtown.
They wouldn't tell me how she was killed.
I just want to know what happened.
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
How long had you and Colleen been dating?
We weren't.
We broke up about three weeks ago.
But before that, we'd been together for... about six months.
Why'd you break up?
Different priorities.
I make pretty good money, but I wear shorts to work, you know?
That was never gonna be enough for Colleen.
When's the last time you saw her?
About three weeks ago, the night we broke up.
Detective Rush told me that you...
Transferred to a different delivery route.
Yeah, I got to know Colleen because she orders so much stuff online.
Um...
last thing I wanted after we broke up was to see her name on my delivery list every day.
So you still had feelings for her.
I didn't kill her, if -- if that's what you're asking.
No, that's not what I'm asking.
But I'm glad to hear you say that, so I can assume that you won't mind if we swab for DNA?
Where were you last night?
My shift ended around 10:00, and I went out for a beer with some of the guys.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Nice job tracking down the boyfriend.
Now, if you wouldn't mind checking out his alibi...
Hey, Romeo, this is the job.
It's connect the dots.
It's chasing down a thousand little details that might bust open a case.
I know.
I get it.
Colleen Watkins has a sister way out in Apple Valley.
Local P.D. is driving out to give her the bad news.
Is this the new guy?
Ah.
Ramon, this is Ted Buerge.
I'm sure you guys have lots to talk about.
L.T.'s been chatting you up.
But -- hoo!
Didn't mention the dancing shoes.
They call you Romeo, right?
Uh, Ramon Rush, patrol.
I'm on loan to you guys as a detective.
Ah.
I love new guys.
I got to be in court today with Van Stone.
Pick up my shirts for me, okay, handsome?
It's just a game.
Do we like the ex-boyfriend as the doer?
He has motive, but we're checking out his alibi.
S.I.D. got into Colleen Watkins' e-mail account.
She's been receiving steamy messages for the last month or so.
Well, that would fit the timeline.
She broke up with her boyfriend about -- what?
-
- Three weeks ago.
You got a name?
Yeah, I do.
And if either of you recognize it, let me know.
His name is smoothloverx.
Now, it's a hotmail account, so we don't have a name, but I can read you one of his e-mails.
Oh, whoa.
That's not necessary.
"Dearest Colleen, your touch has unleashed the lion in me."
Okay, I think we --
"My days are spent in reverie, imagining the next time your mouth, your tongue --"
okay, you know, I get it.
Uh, wait a minute.
"Your breath is on my skin.
"That we must be discreet,
"that I can't shout your name from the rooftop,
"tears my soul asunder.
Alas --" Okay, who says "asunder"?
The same guy who says "alas."
O'Dell, the headmaster.
So Colleen Watkins was sleeping with her boss.
Yes.
And her boss calls himself smoothloverx.
Ew!
Ew!
So, you lied to us.
You were having an affair with Colleen Watkins.
Smoothloverx.
Those are personal.
Yes, and they were florid and fraught with cliché.
Do you write notes like that to the missus?
Look, I-I liked Colleen, I had fun with her, but I never had any intention of leaving my wife.
Did she know that?
Yes, Colleen was aware of my situation.
Well let's see if I can understand your situation.
You knew how important it was for Colleen to be at Benford, so you used your power and your position to seduce her.
And then when you got tired of the arrangement, you --
I didn't kill her.
Where were you last night?
I was in my office, at school, writing a speech for alumni weekend.
I was there till 11:00.
And did anyone see you there?
No.
Hmm.
Where was your wife?
Um, she -- she was at a board meeting.
She got home after I did.
And when we talk to her, she'll be able to tell us the same thing.
I didn't kill Colleen.
We'll need to take some prints and collect some DNA.
Is there, uh, any way of keeping this quiet?
Benford can't really afford any more bad publicity.
What do you mean "any more"?
A family sued the school after their son was rejected from Dartmouth.
Th-the lawsuit named Colleen as a defendant.
The case was dismissed, but the school's still recovering.
Alas...
Alas, a lawsuit and an affair.
Any other grenades you'd like to throw into the fire?
- Does the school get sued a lot?
- No.
No, b-but families like the Delgados expect us to work miracles.
If you're looking for someone with an ax to grind against Colleen, I'd look at them.
Hang on.
Sheppard.
Yes, this is she.
Oh, well, what did he do?
Yeah, I can do that.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Nick's principal wants to see me.
She say why?
No, she just said she wants to see me.
Today.
Patrick's an amazing kid, and we spent every dime that we have to send him to Benford.
Yeah, then he was rejected from Dartmouth -- early decision.
Another boy from his class got in, a boy with lower grades.
But his parents gave money to Benford for a new gym.
So you think that Colleen was giving this rich kid preferential treatment.
They talk a good game about scholarship and diversity.
But at the end of the day, we were never accepted.
So, where were you two last night?
Here, with Patrick.
We had a late shipment.
And we didn't get home until midnight.
Check the security tapes, if you want.
It's all there.
- Tell me you're not saying anything crazy.
- Patrick!
No, for the zillionth time, I told you it wasn't
Colleen's fault that Dartmouth didn't want me.
She did everything she could to help.
I just didn't have what it takes.
I don't see them doing this.
Hey, 'Chelle, did their son, Patrick -- did he seem kind of anxious to you?
He seemed embarrassed by the whole thing.
No, it was more than that.
It was like he was agitated.
I'll have a uniform come back for all the security tapes.
Hopefully, Patrick is in them with his parents.
You know, they -- they spent everything to send their kid to this school, and they just looked miserable.
Yeah, well, you know, it's tough.
You always want the best for your kids.
Yeah, well, we didn't go to Ivy League schools.
State colleges worked pretty good for you and me.
Good job, good money, solid benefits.
Oh, yeah.
I'd die without the dental.
I got this genetic plaque thing, and it's like it takes, like, an ice pick to get that stuff out of there.
Yeah, not that I don't love your dental horror stories...
Excuse me.
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
Thanks.
Coroner's report just came in.
They confirmed Colleen Watkins died around 9:00 last night from her knife wounds.
They also said that she had intercourse, but her partner used a condom, so DNA is a long shot.
Hey, Nick, how was school today?
You know, school.
Anything special happen?
Nope.
All right, Nick, why is the principal calling me, huh?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
Look, let me talk to Uncle Davey.
Uncle Davey's in the shower.
Mom, I really can't talk right now.
Leo and I are doing a science project.
For school?
For fun.
Bye.
He must have done something really bad.
Are you ready?
3, 2, 1.
Start the timer.
What about the family with the nursery?
Well, they were upset but not insanely so.
Their son seemed jumpy, so we're checking out his alibi, as well as theirs.
This was a crime of passion, and there's plenty of passion to go around.
The ex, Tim Kane, was kicked to the curb because Colleen was embarrassed of him, and Alex O'Dell was cheating on his wife.
And how are the alibis on those two?
Well, Rush is tracking the ex's delivery schedule, and O'Dell didn't have one.
We're bringing his wife in to see if she knew about the affair.
Curious to see just how passionate she was about her marriage.
Any physical evidence?
The knife was wiped clean, and whoever she had sex with used a condom, so...
Did you get anything else off the victim's computer?
Just that the girl loved to shop.
I mean, there are a few third-party web addresses that S.I.D. is still trying to crack.
Uh, Mrs. O'Dell is here.
Nice shoes, detective.
It's good to see someone take a little pride in their appearance around here.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna head out.
Mrs. O'Dell, how long had you known that your husband was having an affair with Colleen Watkins?
Almost from the get-go.
Alexander's not really capable of keeping a secret from me.
And you never felt that the affair would threaten your marriage?
My husband and I connect on many levels, but romance isn't one of them.
We each have our own special friends for that, and we're fine with it.
You know, I noticed at the school that a number of the girls were quite taken with him.
Do you think that your husband would ever become involved with one of his students?
He's always getting poems and flowers and cards, but he'd never risk crossing that line.
He enjoys his job too much.
Why have the devotion of just one when he can be adored by them all?
Hmm.
I just spoke with the victim's sister.
She said Tim Kane went all stalker on Colleen after she broke up with him -- waiting for her at apartment, following her to school, begging for a second chance.
This all fits with what Romeo found out.
Yeah, something wasn't making sense when I tracked the ex-boyfriend's delivery schedule, so I talked to the guy who took over his old route.
The guy was supposed to deliver a package to Colleen.
The ex took it and told him he was going over to her house anyway.
The victim signed for the package at 8:14.
The ex returned the truck at 10:06.
But Colleen's apartment is only a 20-minute drive.
So that puts an angry ex-boyfriend in her apartment delivering a package less than an hour before the murder.
Colleen signed for a package that you delivered at 8:14, an hour before she was dead.
Okay, you've been stalking her all hours of the night, and you expect us to believe that you were not involved?
I never touched her.
So you didn't have sex with her.
I didn't kill her.
She was upset.
I-I-I could tell as soon as she opened the door that she'd been crying.
- Did she explain why?
- No, no.
She just...hugged me.
And then you had sex with her.
Yeah.
I mean no.
No, not right away, no.
It wasn't -- it wasn't like that.
Colleen initiated, not me.
Well, that must have been very confusing for you, what with all the feelings you still had for her.
Is that the first time that you'd been intimate with Colleen since the breakup?
So you must have thought that you had a chance at getting back together with her, huh?
Yeah.
I thought I had a shot.
But she told you you didn't.
No, I'm just another embarrassing thing in her rearview mirror, like her family's farm or the little state college she went to in Texas.
God forbid anybody at Benford ever hear anything about me.
I couldn't get her where she wanted to go.
Maybe that's why she had an affair with somebody at Benford.
You didn't know about that.
No, but it explains a lot.
So, then, that's -- that's why she was crying when I dropped off the package, right?
Some other dude.
Hey, this package -- do you happen to know where it was in the apartment?
The kitchen counter, maybe.
Any idea what was in it?
Shoes, clothes, shampoo --
Colleen ordered her whole life online.
All right.
Sit tight.
You're not going anywhere.
Well, he's big enough and hurt enough.
Plus, he got double-dumped.
For 17 minutes, he thought that they were back together.
17?
With an ex, you're lucky to get 12.
Well, somebody has a digital clock in their bedroom.
Hey, I get sex with an ex.
There's no instruction manuals, there's no surprises, and it definitely does not raise the number.
Yeah, but it's still tricky, you know?
One person's always more invested than the other, you know?
Hey, I don't remember seeing a package at Colleen's apartment.
You?
No, and I stood right next to the counter.
I wonder what happened to it.
Hey, you know what?
I got to go.
I got to get to Nick's school for that meeting with the principal.
Okay, and I'll put the ex on ice for the night.
There's enough to hold him.
On the way home, I'll stop by Colleen's apartment, see if I can find that package.
All right.
Wish me luck.
What you doing?
Going over these delivery records for Dulcett on the Colleen Watkins' case.
Ain't cop work a hoot?
Uh, lieutenant has a task for you.
Yeah, as soon as I'm finished with this --
L.T. needs it asap.
He takes priority.
Need you to dig up a file -- last name Maines, first name Myra.
It's personal.
On the D.L.
Don't just leave it on his desk.
Make sure you put it in his hand.
Mack, Madden, Mahoney...
Maines.
Hey, I've got a file for the lieutenant.
Oh, I'll take it.
Oh, I'm supposed to put it directly in his hands.
Uh, any idea where he went?
He headed toward reception.
Hey, have you seen the L.T.?
No.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey, lieutenant heard you were looking for Myra Maines.
"My remains"?
Buerge, right?
Yeah.
That file's been suckering rookies for a hundred years.
You know how I'd get even?
Pizzas.
Like 20 of them in his name.
Why don't you put that back for the next guy?
Welcome aboard, detective.
Hey, Buerge.
Hey.
Hey, I gave the lieutenant the file.
He thought it was a riot.
Don't even think about getting me back.
I've heard it all.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Just so you know, women throw themselves at me everywhere I go.
Mm.
At the car wash, the supermarket, even the dry-cleaners.
It's insane how much tail I get.
Damn it.
You win.
How's it going?
Damn it!
Nick's always had a ton of energy.
You know, he probably gets that from me.
I'm always saying, you know,
"Nick, use your powers for good, not evil," you know?
Not -- not that he's evil, you know what I mean?
Not, like, stuff that I've seen, of course.
Mrs. Sheppard, Nick's not in trouble.
He -- what?
That's not why you're here.
Oh, good.
Um...
Really?
Just the opposite, in fact.
Um, your son received the highest scores in this school's history on the G.S.E.
My Nick?
You should be very proud.
But he's always saying that school is so boring.
No offense.
None taken.
That's not uncommon with really bright children.
The work doesn't challenge them, so they tune out.
Wow.
It's just, um...
It's amazing.
Well, is there some extra stuff that he should be doing, like...
Spelling words or --
That's why I wanted you to come in.
As much as we would love to keep Nick here at our school,
I'm not sure we have the resources he needs.
You just lost me.
What?
Nick needs to be surrounded by peers of his intelligence level.
If I were you, I would check into some of the more academic private schools.
I mean, how is this even possible, you know?
I mean, I'm his mom and a detective.
How could I have missed this?
Genius.
Really?
It's just...
He's pretty diabolical in DD.
Yeah, but, you know,
I expect Nick to be that kind of genius, okay?
That kind of genius I can handle.
But what am I supposed to do with this one, you know?
The real kind -- you know, the kind that has to go to private schools and have tutors and cellos and -- Cellos?
Well, for instance, you know?
Look, I mean, part of the reason you guys came out here was because the schools were better.
Maybe you sensed his need.
Maybe.
I don't know, though, Davey.
You know what?
I was at a private school today, and, I mean, the grounds were just gorgeous, right?
The campus was beautiful.
They had all the resources money could buy.
But the kids there, they just -- they didn't seem like kids, you know?
And I don't know.
I mean, is that what we want for Nick?
Do we want to put him into that kind of an environment and...
I don't know.
Nick tends to roll with the program.
You sure you're not worried about how you'd fit in?
Well, I wouldn't.
I mean, I already know that.
But, then again, it's not like I'm a perfect fit in the school he's at now, you know?
I mean, there aren't too many other parents carrying firearms or showing up at parent-teacher conferences with a tranny hooker cuffed in the backseat.
Sad but true.
You know what?
The bottom line is that I am just gonna have to do the very best that I can for Nick...
The genius.
You know, you and your ex are both very smart people.
It's entirely possible that your kids are even smarter.
Ooh.
Well, maybe.
I don't know.
Let me clean this up.
Got a towel?
Hang on.
I'll get the phone.
Hey, 'Chelle.
Hey.
So, I went back to Colleen's apartment and I double-checked with S.I.D.
There was no package at the apartment or in the trash.
You know what?
Maybe we're asking the wrong question.
Maybe we should be trying to figure out what was in the package, and then we can figure out who took it.
Okay, I'll have S.I.D. track the sender's I.S.P.
Through the delivery company in the morning.
You know what?
I'm gonna head by Benford in the morning.
There was this girl that I talked to this morning, and -- and she knew about Colleen's days as an undergrad in Texas.
Now, if Colleen was embarrassed of her past, why is she telling this kid anything?
Hey, hey, give me a kiss.
That's a good question.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, no, I know.
Okay.
All right, see you then.
Bye.
Nick!
- Hey, how was your first day of school?
- Hey.
Well, I, uh...
Picked up Buerge's dry-cleaning.
I tracked down a delivery truck, and chased about a dozen stupid little details that are probably gonna go nowhere.
Yeah.
That sounds about right.
Not for me.
Why?
'Cause every day on the streets is a shoot-'em-up rodeo?
No, of course not, but --
You know what?
I don't know what this is really all about, but you are messing it up.
I don't remember asking your opinion.
You are looking at a chance to work in one of the best detective divisions in the world.
I waited 10 years for my shot, and for whatever reason,
Valdez is reaching out and offering you a shortcut --
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
No, no, no.
I caught every word.
If you can't recognize an opportunity... then maybe you should go back to patrol.
Nick?
I told you to go to bed.
No, you did not.
Good night, Nick!
He's going up right now.
Yeah, show me the computer.
It's nothing.
It's just a little thing that we were...
It's like math.
What do you mean it's like math?
You'll overreact.
No, I won't.
Give me the computer.
Mom, I won 50 bucks, right?
50 bucks.
That's great.
What?
Give me the computer.
Give it to me.
What do you mean you won fif--
Blackjack?
Davey?
Really?
Uh, am I in trouble?
No.
Can I keep the money?
No way.
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
What?
Are you kidding me, man?
Online gambling?
What are you doing?
He's 11.
I'm sorry.
- How good is he?
- Really good.
Really?
Yeah.
He split a pair of aces, and he caught two Queens.
What is that?
50 bucks.
Hmm.
I was looking at private schools today.
We're gonna need a whole lot more than 50 bucks.
Nick!
Stop it.
That's not funny.
You're such a --
Excuse me.
It's Madison, isn't it?
Yeah.
You have a good memory.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Colleen.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, walk me to class?
Sure.
Madison, how did you know that Colleen did her undergrad in Texas?
Oh, she told me.
We talked about all kinds of things when we worked together.
That happens a lot.
People confide in me.
Oh.
Well, that's wonderful.
I also noticed that you were very close to headmaster O'Dell the other day.
It's great that you have such a strong support network.
Still, it's got to be a lot for you, you know, losing your college adviser in the middle of the year.
It's not easy, but I try not to let it slow me down.
Yeah, well, still, you wouldn't be normal if it didn't set you back a bit.
Not my favorite word.
"Normal" might be okay for your job, but it's not going to get me into Yale.
That's what Colleen was helping me with -- focus.
When I mentioned headmaster O'Dell, you seemed uncomfortable.
Not really.
When I saw the two of you talking back there, he seemed upset with you.
Madison, if this has anything to do with Colleen, you should really tell me.
I couldn't tell you anything yesterday, not with Alex there.
After my appointment with Colleen the other day,
I went to the gym to get my tennis bag.
I don't know if this is hearsay or admissible, and I don't want to be a tattling bitch.
No one thinks that.
I saw Colleen arguing with Alex.
She was begging him to leave his wife.
He said that there was no way, but she was hysterical, and he was really, really angry.
Well, thank you for telling me.
Let's, uh, get you to class.
What do you have on the Colleen Watkins case?
We got a lot.
There's this girl, a student at Benford -- she's got a serious crush on the headmaster.
Anyway, she said that she saw him and Colleen arguing the day of the murder.
How is his alibi?
Nonexistent.
His wife's alibi does check out, though.
They both lawyered up.
We're still holding the ex because we've established that he was with Colleen around the time of the murder.
That is a lot.
Yeah.
Any word on the missing package?
'Chelle's having S.I.D. track the online shipping company.
We're trying to figure out what was inside.
You think the contents will clarify things?
Maybe, yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Your kids, they go to private schools, right?
Yeah.
It was my ex's idea.
Which one?
First and second.
Why?
Well, Nick, my eldest, he aced this test, and his principal thinks that we should send him to a better school.
Um...
So, anyway, I started looking online, and --
They all cost a fortune.
Yeah, I just don't see how I can afford it, unless I start knocking over liquor stores on the side.
I try not to think about the boat
I could have bought with all that money -
- Catalina 47.
You could sail it around the world if you want.
But most days, my kids love their school, and they're doing real well, so it's worth it.
Yeah, well...
Found what was in the package.
Adderall.
Lots of Adderall.
Colleen had prescriptions from three different online pharmacies.
She was getting almost 100 pills a month.
There's no way in hell this is for A.D.D.
Hey, what if she was pushing it on the kids?
I mean, at the Delgados' yesterday, their son said that Colleen did everything that she could to help him.
What if that included selling him Adderall?
Yeah, well, it would explain why he was so agitated.
You know, a lot of these kids abuse this drug because they think it's gonna raise their I.Q.
Yeah, they're morons for thinking that.
Only thing it will raise is their blood pressure, cause a stroke.
Let's go talk to Patrick Delgado.
Yep.
You were on Colleen's calendar twice in the last month.
Now, don't you think that's a little odd given that your parents sued her?
I guess.
Maybe.
We checked with your teachers.
The dates you saw her were right before you had big exams.
Was Colleen selling Adderall to you to help you study?
No.
Patrick, look -- you're 18 years old.
We don't need your parents' permission to take you downtown.
She wasn't selling it.
What, she gave it to you out of the kindness of her heart?
Colleen was more like a trainer for a sports team -- always careful about how she dosed us.
Only gave us the pills before a big exam to help us focus.
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?
You wanted to take it more often.
Thought it would make you smarter.
I told Colleen I'd even buy them from her.
She wouldn't do it.
So what'd you do?
Found another source.
Total bitch but fewer rules.
Are you talking about Madison?
Maybe.
I know my rights.
They need a warrant to search my locker.
Alex, please tell them they can't do this.
Look, I'm sorry, detectives, but Madison's right.
There is no way I can allow you to do this on school property without a search warrant.
We really need a warrant?
Well, I have to protect my students.
Well, we can get a warrant, can't we, 'Chelle?
Yeah, a couple hours, yeah.
Just know that, when we do come back, we'll bring about a dozen black-and-whites, sirens blaring, and we may even call in a helicopter so none of the neighbors miss out on any of the action.
Unless, of course, you think that might bring more bad publicity to the school.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
Hey, my father's gonna sue you both.
How could you?
I'm so sorry.
Hey, none of you can look in there without my permission!
Back up.
I have rights!
Yeah, you do have rights...
Like remaining silent.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say or do will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be appointed for you.
Do you understand the rights as I have said them to you?
I'm going to take Madison down to R.H.D.
Your parents know that we're going there and that we're charging you with possessing and selling narcotics.
My dad's a lawyer.
Yeah, you've said that already.
I'm sure he's gonna be really happy with your new career move.
Didn't know they could arrest somebody for being a bitch.
That kid was out of line.
He didn't think I was a bitch when he needed something.
You mean drugs?
You can't trick me into talking.
And even if you could, it wouldn't matter.
You're not allowed to interrogate me without my parents or a lawyer present.
I see.
Well, get in the car.
I know my rights.
I can say anything to you, and it's inadmissible in court.
Sounds like you know the rules.
It's, like, the only advantage to being a minor.
I understand.
Doubt it.
You have no idea what it's like to be me.
Perfect S.A.T.s, captain of the tennis team, and yet there's still no guarantee I'll get into Yale.
I couldn't have handled that when I was your age.
Most people can't.
But you're so smart.
Why deal drugs?
You don't need the money.
You're not listening.
My dad's a really good lawyer.
God, you sound just like Colleen.
Colleen knew you were dealing?
Most of her advisees started buying from me because I didn't have any stupid rules.
She just couldn't handle that I was more popular, so she tried to stop me.
She even threatened to tell Alex, as if she could ever turn him against me.
Really?
Did she try to talk to you about that?
Of course.
But the problem with Colleen was she never really understood her place.
Is that why you went to her apartment?
To remind her?
Because from what I've heard, you were not the only person who felt that Colleen didn't understand her place at Benford.
She's not one of us.
She works for us.
It's crazy.
It's almost as if she was trying to destroy everything that you've worked for.
Oh, I warned her that.
I mean, I tried to reason with her.
I'm usually really good at that, okay?
But she just wouldn't back down.
She slapped me, so I hit her back.
I've never hit anyone before.
I've never used a knife like that.
I just kept thinking, "she's gonna ruin everything!"
And there was no way I could let that happen -- not from someone like her.
I couldn't stop.
Then she was quiet.
Too bad you can't use any of that.
Well, actually, I can use all of it.
What don't you understand?
I'm a minor.
No, it's what you don't understand.
Now, I didn't go to Yale, but I'm pretty sure you just confessed to murder, and I'm a little disappointed that you didn't know this.
But, by law, there is no assumption of privacy in a police car, not even for a minor.
So I just, uh -
- I tape-recorded everything you said.
Let's see your daddy get you out of that.
Thanks.
Peace offering.
Hey.
Didn't know we were at war.
A couple of weeks ago, Lieutenant Valdez asked me if there was some patrol cops that I thought were real up-and-comers.
Oh, so it's your fault I got promoted.
Yeah, you have a very funny way of phrasing that, but, yeah.
Yeah, I thought I was doing you a solid.
Um, you can always go back to patrol, you know.
Mm.
Not without chatting the L.T.
Well, maybe someday you will explain to me what's so terrible about getting a bump.
But just so you know,
I really like seeing you around the office.
And...
Uh, I think you have the goods to be a really great detective.
Happy first solved murder, rookie!
Hear, hear.
Oh, I don't know what you guys are toasting me for.
I did nothing to solve this case.
That's not true.
You picked up my laundry, got my car washed.
Hey, in honor of your first case...
You want to grow up and be a real detective like me, you got to learn to dress the part.
Hey, hon, another round for the team.
And, uh, give this slick-lookin' dude the bill.
Hey.
Hey, newbies buy.
It's tradition.
That's right!
That's right!
All right.
Hey, uh, next weekend, we're gonna take a test for a different school.
Okay.
It's no big deal, you know.
You don't need to worry about it or anything.
We're just gonna...
We're just gonna explore our options, okay?
Do what's best for you.
Sure.
Honey, you're a smart boy, you know?
You need to be challenged at school.
You shouldn't be bored.
So this may mean that you stay at your school or, you know, you may go to a different school, so...
Okay.
The most important thing to me is that you're happy.
I am.
Good.
The standardized tests?
They're totally easy.
Well, for you, maybe.
For anyone.
You just need a strategy.
A strategy.
Mom, you know the bubbles you fill in?
Mm-hmm.
As you go down the page, you just have to make them go back and forth.
Sort of like a Christmas tree.
A Christmas tree.
Of course.
Nick, you're a genius.
Yep.

(Male announcer) Previously on MasterChef, one home cook exploded in the kitchen.
I don't think my dish is the worst dish here.
I think you're wrong.
(Suzy) His arrogance-- it's stinking up this kitchen.
(Announcer) And a new rivalry erupted.
I told Jennifer I think she's a bitch, and I'll cook her under the table any day of the week.
(Announcer) At the end of the day, one more homecook's MasterChef dreams came to a bitter end.
Jenny, your time is done in MasterChef.
Tonight, the cooks are thrown into the lion's den.
You're not gonna work like a little pig in my kitchen.
Gordon Ramsay has lost his mind.
I want that [bleep] mess cleaned up.
Worst dish I've ever seen in MasterChef.
And on top of that, that is the worst dish that has ever left my kitchen.
(Announcer) Now just 12 cooks remain to battle it out in front of three culinary heavyweights.
[Bleep] stupid [bleep] cake.
(Announcer) At stake--$1/4 million, and the title...
[Bleep] cake!
(Announcer) Of MasterChef!
[Bleep]
MasterChef 2x10 Top 12 Compete Original Air Date on July 11, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
(Announcer) The remaining 12 amateur cooks have been brought to the rooftop of an elite Hollywood hotel.
Let's go.
Come through.
(Announcer) They'll be split into opposing teams for today's high-end catering challenge.
The losing team will face a pressure test where one more cook's MasterChef dream will die.
Welcome to London West Hollywood.
[Cheering]
This hotel has a special place in my heart, 'cause it houses my Los Angeles restaurant.
You are gonna be cooking for a Hollywood party right here.
All right.
You'll be split into two teams, and each team will have to conceptualize, prepare, and cook different hors d'oeuvres for our v.I.P. Guest list.
The courses are...
Vegetable, beef, and a dessert.
(Gordon) All of you are gonna be cooking in my Michelin-star kitchen downstairs.
Yes!
Yes!
We had two stunning dishes from our last challenge.
Based on that, Ben and Christian will be picking your teams.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
I couldn't have asked to be a team captain for a better team challenge.
I can't wait to just start the game and take Ben down.
Ben, first choice.
Chef, I've seen at least one contestant so far produce a presentation like this.
I'm really, really hoping I'm gonna be on Ben's team.
I think Christian's amazing, but he's really aggressive in the kitchen.
My first selection is definitely going to be Suzy.
(Gordon) Suzy.
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
(Ben) First-round draft pick.
The fact that Ben chose me first shows that I am one of the top dogs in MasterChef.
Christian, who is it, please?
Adrien.
[Applause]
Okay, Ben Starr.
Tracy.
Tracy.
Wow.
All right.
I'm gonna go with Alejandra.
Okay, good.
Jen.
Wow.
Derrick.
Wow.
Esther.
I'm going with, uh, Giuseppe.
All right, Giuseppe.
I'm with the boys today.
Whoo!
I'm last again, almost, and I'm thinking,
"please, I do not want to be on Christian's team."
I've seen this person produce incredible miracles under pressure, and that person is Christine.
(Gordon) Christine.
Christine for the full house-- all-girl team.
Not all.
[Laughing]
Okay.
(Erryn) Nobody wants to pick me.
That's fine.
I don't know why, because I'm 2-0, and I perform really well on these team challenges.
So all it is is just fueling my fire right now.
Ben!
Yes, chef.
Looks like you've got Charlie's Angels there.
(Christian) I had a feeling Ben was gonna be picking a lot of the girls, which is fine.
Girls--um, I like 'em, but they're a little bit more dramatic than guys.
And I think when it comes to being in a kitchen, you can't really have a lot of drama.
You've got 90 minutes to prep three stunning hors d'oeuvres.
(Ben) We have 90 minutes to cater a Hollywood party.
Hello!
Can somebody bring a straitjacket over here?
Gordon Ramsay has lost his mind.
Your time starts now.
Off you go.
Run.
(Announcer) Each team has 90 minutes to devise and create 300 luxury hors d'oeuvres from the ingredients in Chef Ramsay's kitchen.
Each one of you is gonna take ownership of a single course.
I am not a dictator.
If you want your team to produce brilliant results, you have to empower them to do something that they're passionate about.
First course is veggie.
Does anybody have-- I can do veggie.
You can do veggie?
Gazpacho.
Okay.
Beef.
Yes?
Beef.
Me beef?
Sure.
Do you want rib eye, short ribs, or filet?
Filet.
Filet.
Christine's doing an open-faced Wellington, a little bit of puff pastry, mushrooms, filet, creme fraiche--done.
Last course is Esther's beautiful, dainty chocolate profiteroles.
Listen, I'm your bitch.
I'm here to support you.
(Alejandra) Let's go, guys.
(Announcer) Ben is running his team in a democratic fashion.
But on the red team, Christian's making all the calls.
All right, vegetable?
Gazpacho.
(Derrick) Christian has a menu mapped out in his head, and that's what we're going with.
Some of his ideas, I'm wondering if they're a little too risky or edgy.
Beef--we'll do a little tartare.
Yes.
A little pepper-- we'll torch it.
I'm in charge of the beef tartare, and I've never made beef tartare.
I mean, hell, I've never even eaten beef tartare.
It's a risky thing, 'cause, you know, it's raw meat.
And for the dessert?
We'll do profiterole with filling.
[Voices overlapping] Okay, let's do this, guys.
Christian and Ben, please.
Ben!
Ben!
Yes, chef!
Two seconds, please.
Christian, let's go.
Quick.
So Gordon calls me and Ben over, um, for a little powwow to go over our menus.
Ben!
[Claps hands]
(Christian) Let's go, Ben!
Come on!
Now!
I don't have time for this [bleep]!
(Christian) I just had to yell at Ben to get over there, because he's wasting my time.
If Gordon can yell in the kitchen,
I think, uh, I can yell in the kitchen, too.
Talk to me about the dishes.
Vegetable--we have a gazpacho shooter.
Christian.
They must have been listening to us, 'cause, um, Adrien went with a gazpacho.
Okay, so are you two copying each other?
No, chef.
The list of ingredients here is extraordinary,
I mean, really extraordinary.
Desserts.
On a high-- what is it?
Esther is on desert.
She's doing very dainty chocolate profiteroles with a lattice of chocolate on top.
Wow.
Ambitious.
Um, a profiterole, again, and, um...
Wow.
It's the same dishes competing.
Have the balls to change...
Mm-hmm.
If it's not hitting perfection.
You're the captains for a reason.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
Listen, we don't have to change courses here.
All we have to do is make sure ours tastes better.
Esther, look at me.
Look at me.
You're not gonna work like a little pig in my kitchen.
Yes, chef.
I want that [bleep] mess cleaned up.
I'm cleaning everything up right now.
(Announcer) Despite Gordon's fear of similar menus,
Adrien and Suzy are both going ahead with their gazpachos.
I've done gazpacho a couple of times before.
I'm gonna keep it simple and keep it, like, really delicious and fresh.
Adrien, how we doing?
Doing all right.
I need to adjust my seasonings.
I'm doing a gazpacho again, but I'm doing a duo.
Are you doing them at the same time or layered?
Yeah.
It's going in the same cup, so just layered.
Make sure they're the same thickness.
Obviously, this looks like puree, and this one's thinner.
So just be careful about that.
Not only do I find out that Adrien's doing a gazpacho, uh, but he's doing a duo.
He's like the one-upper.
I'm so screwed.
(Announcer) Meanwhile, Christine is trying to ensure her cooked beef dish beats Derrick's raw beef tartare.
I just went through a pressure test where I had to cook a filet, so hopefully I can do it again.
[Bleep]!
Only concern is that I overcook, which I hope I don't do.
[Sighs]
Do I cut out--cut out a thick [bleep] steak like that?
Oh, that's fine.
I have Derrick on the beef, and raw meat's very risky.
But I'm sticking with my plan, and, uh, you know, that's what chefs do.
(Announcer) Esther is going up against Giuseppe on the dessert course.
He's ditched a disastrous batch of profiteroles and is now switching to fruit tarts.
The profiteroles didn't come out right.
I didn't have, uh, a scale, so I had to go by eye, and that is very hard, man.
You can't make it.
Mama Mia.
(Announcer) Esther also managed to mess up her first batch of profiteroles.
Attempt number two isn't going much better.
There is something wrong with this flour.
Esther, what's that for?
I'm making the batter again.
Something went wrong.
I could tell right when I touched them.
Okay, you're making a choux pastry for dessert.
Yes.
Concerns?
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm deeply concerned...
Concerned that they'll take 12, 15 minutes to cook...
Right.
15 minutes to cool down.
Right.
Are you mad?
If I don't have the dessert ready on time, then we forfeit the dessert course, and all those votes will automatically go to the red team.
If it's not cooked in the center, you're screwed.
Right.
I just need Gordon to get out of my face.
(Announcer) 600 hors d'oeuvres for the Hollywood cocktail party must be served in just 30 minutes, but Gordon isn't happy with progress so far.
I mean, I'm deeply concerned.
If it's not cooked in the center, you're screwed.
Right.
One-bite wonders, yeah?
Let's go.
(Announcer) Both teams are putting final touches to their gazpachos.
(Suzy) I want you guys to try this.
Okay.
More salt?
Yeah.
So we can put, um, just, like, a dash of this on the bottom and then the red over the top.
(Christian) Giuseppe, how's it going now?
All right.
All right, that doesn't-- you don't sound positive, buddy.
Over here.
Over here.
Look at this.
Hey, look at this guy.
Okay.
Um...
It needs-- it needs something green.
Do we have mint or basil?
Tastes [bleep] awesome.
It's good?
All right.
(Announcer) While Giuseppe is delighted with his red team dessert,
Esther on the blue team is having more problems with her second batch of pastry dough.
What is all that in there?
Yeah, my choux dough-- it doesn't work.
That's all choux dough?
Yeah.
It's [bleep].
How much did you make?
I was trying to do enough for, like, 100, and, um, [bleep], just in case some burned, but...
I am gonna make a third batch of dough, and this time it's gonna work.
I know I can do this.
I have to do it.
(Announcer) Derrick is up against Christine in the beef hors'ovres.
As the blue team puts the finishes touches on their mini beef Wellington,
Chef Ramsay is concerned with the size.
Is that right, the pastry being that thick on there?
This is very, very thick.
(Christine) I have an extra pastry dough circle on top, and Gordon comes by and he's like,
"tis supposed to be an hors d'oeuvre, not a freakin' whatever."
So he's like, "this is too thick."
(Ben) Do you want to pull the top layer off?
There's a lot of pastry there... (Suzy) Just like that, guys, for very little beef.
Go.
Do it.
Let's go.
Red team, who's serving?
Red team, who's serving?
Uh, it was supposed-- [voices overlapping] Who's serving from the red team?
I'm not sure, chef.
Not sure. [Bleep].
The lights are on, but everyone's [bleep] off to Italy.
I have nightmares at night of Gordon.
(Announcer) With time running out,
Joe is worried the red team's beef dish is beyond redemption.
You're gonna serve a raw-- raw meat?
We're--we're gonna sear it off with the torch-- with the torch?
Yes.
I've never seen anyone blowtorch raw beef...
Okay.
In a tartare.
I think you're taking a big risk serving raw beef to this whole big crowd of random people.
11 minutes to go.
(Announcer) After screwing up her profiterole dough twice,
Esther has finally mastered batch number three.
These are good.
I put the third dough in the oven, and they look beautiful.
I'm so relieved.
(Announcer) The final task is to pipe in a perfectly mixed chocolate mousse filling.
(Gordon) Ben.
(Ben) Yes, chef.
The mix is broken.
Just taste the mix.
It's like eating a mouthful of olive oil, butter-- broken, greasy.
I've done this dough three times, and you're telling me the filling's wrong now?
Suzy.
(Suzy) Yeah.
Show me the bag.
Here you go, chef.
Yeah.
You're piping it, and you're piping broken mousse.
This whole course has been a frickin' disaster.
Yes, chef.
'Cause that is disgusting.
They're not gonna let us serve this.
(Announcer) With the filling ruined and time running out, the blue team must come up with a new dessert...
Fast.
Let's do fruit.
Yes.
[Voices overlapping] Strawberries, kumquats, basil.
Perfect.
Done.
Go.
The only thing we have time to make is berries.
That's it.
And do we even have time to do that?
You okay, Ben?
I'm losing it here.
Ben, what is the dessert now, please?
Lightly macerated seasonal strawberries and kumquats and a chiffonade of basil.
So how do they eat them out of the cup?
Is it a spoon, teaspoon-- what is it?
It's a fruit shot.
I can sell anything, chef.
I'm taking it up there.
I really think that this whole challenge is gonna come down to dessert, and if this is what it's going to be with only minutes left on the clock, we are screwed.
Blue team--they actually put together at the last moment a sloppy dessert-- some fruit put in some paper, and you're supposed to just shove it down like this.
Come on, this is a high-life people.
You have to give them something that looks elegant.
Last minute!
Blue team, come on!
See those ones right there?
Put some basil on those.
Yeah.
All right, stay focused, girls.
Okay, let's go!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Good.
Well done.
(Ben) Bring 'em up front!
Kumquat fruit salad with cream.
That's the worst dish I've ever seen compiled in MasterChef.
And on top of that, that is the worst dish that's ever left my kitchen.
I could cry.
I could fricking cry.
(Announcer) For this Hollywood cocktail party challenge, the red and blue teams have each made 300 hors d'oeuvres.
The guests will try each of the team's three courses and vote for their favorites.
Whichever team wins the most courses will be the winner.
First up--the vegetarian course.
Suzy's tomato mint gazpacho for the blue team is taking on Adrien's duo of gazpachos for the red team.
I've got a chilled mint gazpacho.
This is really a head-to-head.
His dish doesn't look as pretty as mine.
It's kind of heavy-handed.
I've got this, like, cool, chilled gazpacho with, like, this flower on top that's, like, edible and beautiful.
And it's, like, a really "sexy" dish for, like, this party.
(Joe) Okay, so, let's try each one.
Let's shoot 'em.
Let's do it.
Cheers.
You have a very beautiful smile...
So you have one point already.
Thank you.
I think it's too salty for me.
Too salty?
A little too salty, yeah.
Okay.
(Joe) And Adrien-- a double gazpacho.
Everyone taste one each.
The balance of the sweetness and the saltiness is very good.
Thank you.
The green doesn't want to liberate itself from the glass.
Maybe this will work.
No, but the thing is you cannot serve that in a restaurant, because it doesn't go down.
(Announcer) For the meat course, the blue team is serving a mini beef Wellington.
And the red team has a torched beef tartare.
I have a play on beef Wellington.
Cheers, guys.
(Joe) You got it in a bite?
No, she didn't do it in a bite.
Do you see?
That's the problem with the 2-bite hors d'oeuvre.
Eventually you'll get a piece of portobello mushroom...
It's good.
Dribbling out of your lip.
Okay, now we'll go to the red team.
This is the classic take on beef tartare--torched.
One bite.
Cheers to one bite.
Cheers.
Good?
Very fresh tasting.
Yeah, it's got a nice tang to it.
Got a little more, yeah, tang.
All right, so you gotta think about it, 'cause we're gonna ask you to vote.
This is very big.
(Announcer) Finally, it's time for dessert.
Can the blue team's 5-minute fruit cup stand a chance against Giuseppe's elegant fruit tart?
Hello, ladies, we have your first bite of springtime here.
Fresh, local strawberries with kumquats, just a hint of basil, and a little bit of whipped cream.
It's a guilt-free way to end your evening.
(Joe) Give it a try.
It's a shooter.
Just take it right in, all in one bite.
Try to keep it in your mouth.
Mmm.
And then from the red team-- Giuseppe, what did you make?
All right, we have a pastry with a sweet mascarpone cheese, raspberries, blueberries, and a little touch of agave.
If I don't win this this time,
I'm gonna be completely devastated, I swear to God.
They were both amazing...
(Joe) Okay.
But that one did it for me.
(Giuseppe) Oh, man, I was shocked.
She liked Ben's dessert better.
I can't believe it.
I have to go with the red, actually.
(Joe) Oh.
That was a little difficult to eat, but this was just nice and classic for me.
And it was good, and the texture was there.
Split decision.
Thanks, guys.
(Announcer) All three courses have been served.
The guests mark their voting cards as the party winds down.
[Overlapping chatter, toasting]
When we hit a hiccup, we kept going.
I could not feel more proud of my girls at this point.
Each and every one of them performed flawlessly.
(All) Two, three--blue!
(Announcer the votes have been counted.
The first team to win two of the three courses will win the challenge, while the losers will face the dreaded pressure test where at least one person will be eliminated from MasterChef.
(Christian) As far as looks and taste, I think we nailed it, and we're gonna win.
The first course was a delicious vegetable course.
(Joe) One gazpacho more classic, one gazpacho double-flavored with guac on the bottom and tomato on top-- one team came up ahead on the gazpacho challenge, and it with 64% of the vote.
Red team.
So the red team-- a little bit more complex, perhaps, a little bit sexy in design.
We really liked the way it looked, the double flavor, so excellent job.
All right, the beef.
Derrick, you look excited.
I was just excited for beef, you know.
All right.
Well, you were in charge of your team's beef hors d'oeuvre, the tartare of tenderloin.
Blue team, we had the beef Wellington.
Who was in charge of that?
I was.
Christine.
This is where it gets interesting.
One team somehow was able to garner 100% of the votes.
Wow.
What?
Every guest that dined tonight that enjoyed the hors d'oeuvres...
Enjoyed the blue team's.
Oh, my God.
You win.
Rock out, girl.
(Christine) People underestimate me as a cook.
When you put me against the wall, then I will usually come out fighting.
You just never know what I'm gonna bring.
Red team, for me, the tartare was bland.
It needed help.
(Derrick) I knew the tartare was risky.
But I didn't expect a full sweep, and nobody did.
(Gordon) It's neck and neck, onto the blue team, one to the red team.
And it's all down to the desserts.
Blue team, you came up with a seasonal spring fruits with a cream.
Red team...
You came out with a puff pastry.
When it comes down to the dessert,
I'm feeling like it's over.
It would take a miracle for our fruit cup to win over Giuseppe's.
It was a very narrow margin.
The winners of the dessert course... (Joe) With 53% of the vote.
Red team.
[Cheering]
I feel great.
I gave actually the victory to my team.
This is a beautiful Hollywood ending.
It couldn't be better than that.
Being in Gordon's kitchen and winning the challenge is awesome.
Good job.
I'm proud of my team, proud of me, and we nailed it.
No pressure test for us.
I feel like a failure as a leader, because they were trusting me to lead them to a win.
It came down to dessert, and it was Esther's fault that we lost.
Blue team, you'll be facing a very demanding pressure test.
Get some rest.
Good night.
(Gordon) Let's go.
Come over, guys, please, let's go.
(Christine) Since my beef Wellington was so amazing last night, it just blows that I'm standing here.
I'm angry, because it's not my fault.
(Esther) My team is facing a pressure test.
Had I been able to deliver the dessert I wanted to,
I don't think we would be here today.
Red team, you were the real stars last night, and you will not be facing a pressure test.
Make your way up to the gallery.
Watch and learn.
I feel amazing that I don't have to go on to the pressure test, 'cause nobody has any idea what it's gonna be, but we do know that somebody's going home, and I know that that somebody is not me.
(Gordon) Okay, for this pressure test, you all will have to create one of these-- a stunning, delicious, eye-capturing layered cake...
A masterpiece built on textures, taste, and visual impact.
I've been baking since about age ten, so I'm extreme comfortable baking cakes.
You'll have two hours to make a cake with a minimum of six layers of sponge.
Why six layers?
Why--why do you need to eat six layers of cake?
Okay, on to your stations, please.
And remember, whoever has the worst layered cake in this pressure test-- at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Two hours...
From now!
Off you go.
(Announcer) In this pressure test, the cooks will have two hours to produce a delectable six-layer cake.
The judges will be looking for perfect construction and presentation as well as amazing taste.
I'm just gonna go with a standard vanilla chiffon cake.
I'm gonna do a cream cheese frosting and maybe add a little bit of basil and strawberry flavoring to that.
I'm gonna do an ice cream sundae, basically, in a layer cake, so we're gonna do banana.
We're gonna have a little bit of hazelnut.
So that's kind of the game plan right now.
Six layers.
For a professional chef, that's a tall task, right?
Right, right.
You have to have the technicality of baking-- architecture, construction, flavor profiles.
Chemistry.
The base of the cake has to be a thick layer so it stands up when you slice that wedge.
Mm-hmm.
The layers in between don't have to be as thick as the bottom base...
Right.
Otherwise it becomes top-heavy.
It's gonna topple.
All right, Ben.
How are we doing?
Hello.
It's gonna be an awful elimination today.
Who do you think now is at risk of going home?
I don't want anybody to go home.
From personal conversations, Tracy hasn't baked a lot.
Hey, Tracy.
How are you today?
There's a lot of talk about you being, uh, a little unexperienced in making desserts
I'm actually not the top baker in this competition.
Who do you think is gonna struggle here?
Um, me.
Christine, talk to me about your cake.
I'm gonna do a raspberry, strawberry and apricot jam in the middle.
Jam?
That's nice.
Yes, preserve.
Okay, good.
But I'm gonna pipe a little icing on the outside, so it doesn't go...
Pffft.
Christine, 30 seconds with you, I need a bottle.
I have some rum.
[Bleep].
[Laughs]
All right, Suzy, what are you doing?
I'm doing a chocolate sponge cake and in between I'm doing a raspberry whip and then a pecan crust on the sides...
Okay.
And a ganache on top.
Super simple, no garnish, no nothing.
Yeah.
All right, Ben...
Yes, chef.
How are you feeling?
I'm feeling very good, Chef.
I'm making a cake that I've made many times.
This is a pumpkin carrot sponge.
In between the pumpkin, what are you putting in there?
I'm doing a cream cheese frosting, and I'm gonna candy some hazelnuts to coat the outside and give it kind of a nice rustic but still elegant .
Hi, Esther.
How are we doing?
Chef, how are you?
What's wrong?
You seem s- so quiet and down and defeated.
I'm a little down.
What's wrong?
I'm not defeated.
I'm just focused.
Okay, good.
You have as good a chance as anybody in this kitchen to pull it out and to win.
Okay, folks, one hour left, and one person is going home.
(Announcer) While the cakes are cooling, the cooks are able to prepare their icing, which will be critical to the construction and flavor of their final cake.
On the sponge cake side, everyone seemed to bake 'em, get 'em out of the oven, and are slicing them pretty good.
I got quite excited about Ben Starr's pumpkin carrot.
However, there's no aeration in the cake...
Sure.
So it's a weighted mass.
Yeah, it's like an orange doorstop.
It's about that thick, and it looks heavy as hell.
Yeah.
Esther is still whipping her frosting.
(Joe) Yeah, that's not a good sign.
If you're just whipping your frosting now, by the time you pipe it on the cake, it's gonna be melted butter, you know?
Yeah.
So they really have some risk with timing now.
We're coming up to 30 minutes left.
[Whirring] You should now start constructing the layers.
The key is just to keep this damn cake up.
Doing just little adjustments here to make sure it's level.
Christine, how many is on there?
You're missing two layers, yeah?
Yeah, I have it right here, chef.
Okay, good.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
I just layer it up, and I'm really not paying attention to how thick the icing is and how thick the jam is.
Just over 15 minutes to go.
[Bleep] stupid [bleep] cake.
(Gordon) That's it, Tracy, all the way around.
Let the palette knife do the work.
I'm liking the consistency.
I'm liking the layers.
It's--it's standing up there nicely.
Then I realize
I've made a crucial error.
No, it's not on.
I didn't put the thing underneath.
You know those little cake rounds that help you move the cake from place to place?
Yeah, I forgot it.
[Bleep]
Put 'em next to each other, then you can slide it over.
I literally lift the cake up and put it onto this glass round.
However, the shape of it is just not the same.
Five minutes to go.
Your cakes should now be assembled and you should be putting your finishing touches on there.
(Esther) I'm freaking out a little bit.
Time is running out, and I'm just trying to get the caked filled.
I'm throwing icing in there.
I'm throwing curd in there.
I'm throwing fresh fruit in there, and I've lost count of the layers.
Last minute!
Really?
My [bleep] icing is melting everywhere.
(Gordon) Start putting those final touches.
30 seconds to go!
I'm in a mad dash to even give them a cake I can present.
This is just stupid.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
[Bleep]
Six, five, four, three, one, and stop!
[Applause]
(Christina) [Bleep] it.
[Bleep] Stupid [Bleep] Cake.
[Bleep].
Five, four, three, two, one, and stop!
[Applause]
(Christina) [Bleep] it.
[Bleep] stupid [bleep] cake.
[Bleep].
That has been the most difficult pressure test ever so far in the history of MasterChef.
And from here, they look amazing.
But at least one of you... will be leaving MasterChef.
Okay, Ben Starr, let's go.
All right, Ben.
Yes, Chef.
Are you okay?
I'm wonderful.
Talk to me.
I-I've been perfecting this cake for five years, and I believe this is the first time
I have had the ingredients to be able to give you something that represents me truly as a cook.
Okay.
And the ability to finally do that in this competition is overwhelming for me.
Great, okay, good.
Describe the cake.
Chef, this is a pumpkin carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and candied hazelnuts.
Here we go.
[Cheers and applause] Oh, my God.
I swear to God, that looks phenomenal...
Thank you, chef.
Absolute sublime.
That is extraordinary...
[Mouthing words] Absolute magic on a fork.
I'm just letting it finish.
My mouth just had an orgasm.
[Laughter] Sorry.
I feel like I have finally spoken to the judges my language, and they've understood it for the first time.
This is Ben Starr.
This is what I want to do with the rest of my life.
Suzy, let's bring it up.
(Suzy) My cake looks amazing.
It's decadent.
It's luscious.
And I hope they love it.
Today I made a ganache and pecan-encrusd cake with chantilly cream on top.
Each layer also has just a chantilly whip with a hint of raspberry as well.
When you mentioned crusted, uh, it definitely is that.
Crusted.
[Laughs]
This one's like-- we're gonna kinda have to do one of these numbers, like...
[Tapping]
The chantilly--I really wish there was more of it, just some more mouthfeel to kind of balance out with the cake.
You know, when I saw you putting the ganache on top of the cake, it was, like, perfect.
And then you went, and you put this--
I don't even know what this is.
It looks like kinda mold growing up a tree on the outside.
So there was a minimalistic kind of perfection to this cake that kinda went to hell.
I mean, this is-- it's gross.
I literally just got served, like, a piece of humble pie.
And I'm realizing that there are people in this competition that could possibly be, like, way better than me.
Okay, Tracy, come on up.
I'm thinking, please, God, just let the cake stand long enough for them to cut it and put it on their plate.
I made a sweet basil and citrus-infused syrup and blended that in with a sweet cream cheese.
So, Tracy, there's two things I notice.
"A"--the asymmetrical construction of the cake, and "B" is the frown on your face.
It's good.
I think that the orange zest and basil really kind of makes it pop a little bit and gives it some brightness and flavor.
It's simple, clean, and, um, intriguing.
Thank you.
Jennifer, let's go.
(Gordon) What is it?
It is a play on a banana split.
So you have your strawberries on top, your nuts on the side, your banana on the inside, your chocolate on the inside.
That looks [bleep] amazing.
[Laughter]
The chocolate goes brilliantly with the sponge, and it's sweetened by the strawberries.
And it tastes delicious.
Great job.
[Applause]
(Graham) Esther, please come forward.
(Esther) It's a lemon raspberry cake.
It's filled with a lemon curd, fresh raspberries.
And then there's a sponge cake brushed with a raspberry and lemon syrup.
It's very, very sweet, almost overly so.
Something about layer cake shows the level of finesse...
Right.
In the construction, but it looks like it's been put together in a panic.
I'm struggling with the lack of balance.
It's got that sort of overpowering acidic but sweetness to it, and it doesn't really work.
I'm frustrated, because I could've done that so much better.
I ran out of time.
Okay, Christine.
It's layers of apricots, raspberries, strawberries, and a little bit of hazelnut liqueur, just layer upon layer.
It seems a little bit...
Kind of, uh...
Sweet-on-sweet, one-dimensional, no contrast, like, uh, boring.
(Gordon) Okay, Christine, the frosting on the outside is what?
[Clears throat] It's buttercream.
Sponge is perfect.
The cake's lacking personality.
And it's pretty sort of run-of-the-mill.
All of you, come down, please.
I'm really disappointed in myself.
Like, this is by far the worst I've ever done, and it sucks that it was during a pressure test.
Two hour to produce a stunning six-layered delicious cake.
Sadly, at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Right.
Tracy, step forward.
Jennifer, step forward.
Ben Starr, step forward...
And take you, Tracy, and Jennifer upstairs.
Congratulations.
[Cheering] Let's go.
Okay, Esther,
Christine, Suzy, clearly all three in the bottom half.
Suzy, it wasn't your best shot.
Christine, on the back of your performance with the beef Wellington, the cake didn't match anywhere near what you produced in the last challenge.
Esther--awkward, it didn't really work, and a bizarre texture.
Christine, step forward, please.
Oh, my God.
You've done a lot inside this competition.
And at times, you've really handled the pressure brilliantly.
The three of us are proud of you.
And I'm sure right now your dad and your son are equally as proud of you.
I'm sorry.
(Announcer) After the six-layer cake pressure test, it's down to the last three.
One of them will be going home.
Christine.
You've done a lot inside this competition.
And at times, you've really handled the pressure brilliantly.
Christine,
I'm sorry, take your apron...
Upstairs to the balcony.
[Cheers and applause]
(Christine) I think I almost peed myself.
People keep underestimating me.
I'm still here to win it, so you just better watch it.
Oh, my God.
At this point,
I think I just got hit by a truck.
And I've got this feeling inside of me, that, like, this is my time.
Esther, Suzy, we've got the neural engineer versus the lawyer.
It's down to me and Suzy.
I quit my job, I'm here, and this opportunity means the world to me.
I'm not ready to go home.
Suzy, what frustrated all three of us was the fact that you had something on the verge of stunning, but the add-ons and the pecans just didn't work.
You don't know where to draw the line in the sand.
Esther, you're a very technical, intelligent cook.
But you looked out of your depth across those two hours.
Esther, step forward.
Oh, my God.
Esther...
Take your apron off.
Your time is done in MasterChef.
Promise...
I'm promising.
Stay on that journey.
I will.
I'm not gonna give up.
I'm not gonna go back to being just a lawyer.
It takes a lot of courage and conviction to quit your job, but it's absolutely worth it when you're pursuing your passion.
Food excites me.
And I feel empowered leaving MasterChef.
The world is my oyster.
Suzy, sometimes across these challenges, you go in denial.
And there's parts of you that produce sort of fake ideas that unfortunately don't really wash.
So we tell you to make you better, and you seem to ignore that advice.
Take the advice, run with it, and come back strong.
You may be walking on thin ice, but the ganache was delicious.
Take your apron upstairs and join the rest of them.
Let's go.
[Applause]
I never, ever, ever in my life ever want to do a pressure test again.
That was my hell.
That was honestly the worst feeling
I've ever had in my life.
That was so much disappointment in myself.
I'm never gonna be in there again.

(Announcer) Next time on MasterChef... (Gordon) The biggest mystery box we've ever had.
(Announcer) One cook's aggression is unleashed.
I'm not here to make friends.
(Announcer) And one judge's temper boils over.
Show these people the same respect they show you.
If not, I'm gonna personally come over there and throw you out of here.
(Announcer) And another home cook's MasterChef dreams will come to an end.
I am speechless.
Previously on MasterChef, one home cook exploded in the kitchen.
I don't think my dish is the worst dish here.
I think you're wrong.
His arrogance-- it's stinking up this kitchen.
And a new rivalry erupted.
I told Jennifer I think she's a bitch, and I'll cook her under the table any day of the week.
At the end of the day, one more homecook's MasterChef dreams came to a bitter end.
Jenny, your time is done in MasterChef.
Tonight, the cooks are thrown into the lion's den.
You're not gonna work like a little pig in my kitchen.
Gordon Ramsay has lost his mind.
I want that mess cleaned up.
Worst dish I've ever seen in MasterChef.
And on top of that, that is the worst dish that has ever left my kitchen.
Now just 12 cooks remain to battle it out in front of three culinary heavyweights.
stupid cake.
At stake--$1/4 million, and the title...
cake!
Of MasterChef!
MasterChef 2x10 Top 12 Compete Original Air Date on July 11, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The remaining 12 amateur cooks have been brought to the rooftop of an elite Hollywood hotel.
Let's go.
Come through.
They'll be split into opposing teams for today's high-end catering challenge.
The losing team will face a pressure test where one more cook's MasterChef dream will die.
Welcome to London West Hollywood.
This hotel has a special place in my heart, 'cause it houses my Los Angeles restaurant.
You are gonna be cooking for a Hollywood party right here.
All right.
You'll be split into two teams, and each team will have to conceptualize, prepare, and cook different hors d'oeuvres for our v.I.P. Guest list.
The courses are...
Vegetable, beef, and a dessert.
All of you are gonna be cooking in my Michelin-star kitchen downstairs.
Yes!
Yes!
We had two stunning dishes from our last challenge.
Based on that, Ben and Christian will be picking your teams.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
I couldn't have asked to be a team captain for a better team challenge.
I can't wait to just start the game and take Ben down.
Ben, first choice.
Chef, I've seen at least one contestant so far produce a presentation like this.
I'm really, really hoping I'm gonna be on Ben's team.
I think Christian's amazing, but he's really aggressive in the kitchen.
My first selection is definitely going to be Suzy.
Suzy.
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
First-round draft pick.
The fact that Ben chose me first shows that I am one of the top dogs in MasterChef.
Christian, who is it, please?
Adrien.
Okay, Ben Starr.
Tracy.
Tracy.
Wow.
All right.
I'm gonna go with Alejandra.
Okay, good.
Jen.
Wow.
Derrick.
Wow.
Esther.
I'm going with, uh, Giuseppe.
All right, Giuseppe.
I'm with the boys today.
Whoo!
I'm last again, almost, and I'm thinking,
"please, I do not want to be on Christian's team."
I've seen this person produce incredible miracles under pressure, and that person is Christine.
Christine.
Christine for the full house-- all-girl team.
Not all.
Okay.
Nobody wants to pick me.
That's fine.
I don't know why, because I'm 2-0, and I perform really well on these team challenges.
So all it is is just fueling my fire right now.
Ben!
Yes, chef.
Looks like you've got Charlie's Angels there.
I had a feeling Ben was gonna be picking a lot of the girls, which is fine.
Girls--um, I like 'em, but they're a little bit more dramatic than guys.
And I think when it comes to being in a kitchen, you can't really have a lot of drama.
You've got 90 minutes to prep three stunning hors d'oeuvres.
We have 90 minutes to cater a Hollywood party.
Hello!
Can somebody bring a straitjacket over here?
Gordon Ramsay has lost his mind.
Your time starts now.
Off you go.
Run.
Each team has 90 minutes to devise and create 300 luxury hors d'oeuvres from the ingredients in Chef Ramsay's kitchen.
Each one of you is gonna take ownership of a single course.
I am not a dictator.
If you want your team to produce brilliant results, you have to empower them to do something that they're passionate about.
First course is veggie.
Does anybody have-- I can do veggie.
You can do veggie?
Gazpacho.
Okay.
Beef.
Yes?
Beef.
Me beef?
Sure.
Do you want rib eye, short ribs, or filet?
Filet.
Filet.
Christine's doing an open-faced Wellington, a little bit of puff pastry, mushrooms, filet, creme fraiche--done.
Last course is Esther's beautiful, dainty chocolate profiteroles.
Listen, I'm your bitch.
I'm here to support you.
Let's go, guys.
Ben is running his team in a democratic fashion.
But on the red team, Christian's making all the calls.
All right, vegetable?
Gazpacho.
Christian has a menu mapped out in his head, and that's what we're going with.
Some of his ideas, I'm wondering if they're a little too risky or edgy.
Beef--we'll do a little tartare.
Yes.
A little pepper-- we'll torch it.
I'm in charge of the beef tartare, and I've never made beef tartare.
I mean, hell, I've never even eaten beef tartare.
It's a risky thing, 'cause, you know, it's raw meat.
And for the dessert?
We'll do profiterole with filling.
Okay, let's do this, guys.
Christian and Ben, please.
Ben!
Ben!
Yes, chef!
Two seconds, please.
Christian, let's go.
Quick.
So Gordon calls me and Ben over, um, for a little powwow to go over our menus.
Ben!
Let's go, Ben!
Come on!
Now!
I don't have time for this !
I just had to yell at Ben to get over there, because he's wasting my time.
If Gordon can yell in the kitchen,
I think, uh, I can yell in the kitchen, too.
Talk to me about the dishes.
Vegetable--we have a gazpacho shooter.
Christian.
They must have been listening to us, 'cause, um, Adrien went with a gazpacho.
Okay, so are you two copying each other?
No, chef.
The list of ingredients here is extraordinary,
I mean, really extraordinary.
Desserts.
On a high-- what is it?
Esther is on desert.
She's doing very dainty chocolate profiteroles with a lattice of chocolate on top.
Wow.
Ambitious.
Um, a profiterole, again, and, um...
Wow.
It's the same dishes competing.
Have the balls to change...
Mm-hmm.
If it's not hitting perfection.
You're the captains for a reason.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
Listen, we don't have to change courses here.
All we have to do is make sure ours tastes better.
Esther, look at me.
Look at me.
You're not gonna work like a little pig in my kitchen.
Yes, chef.
I want that mess cleaned up.
I'm cleaning everything up right now.
Despite Gordon's fear of similar menus,
Adrien and Suzy are both going ahead with their gazpachos.
I've done gazpacho a couple of times before.
I'm gonna keep it simple and keep it, like, really delicious and fresh.
Adrien, how we doing?
Doing all right.
I need to adjust my seasonings.
I'm doing a gazpacho again, but I'm doing a duo.
Are you doing them at the same time or layered?
Yeah.
It's going in the same cup, so just layered.
Make sure they're the same thickness.
Obviously, this looks like puree, and this one's thinner.
So just be careful about that.
Not only do I find out that Adrien's doing a gazpacho, uh, but he's doing a duo.
He's like the one-upper.
I'm so screwed.
Meanwhile, Christine is trying to ensure her cooked beef dish beats Derrick's raw beef tartare.
I just went through a pressure test where I had to cook a filet, so hopefully I can do it again.
!
Only concern is that I overcook, which I hope I don't do.
Do I cut out--cut out a thick steak like that?
Oh, that's fine.
I have Derrick on the beef, and raw meat's very risky.
But I'm sticking with my plan, and, uh, you know, that's what chefs do.
Esther is going up against Giuseppe on the dessert course.
He's ditched a disastrous batch of profiteroles and is now switching to fruit tarts.
The profiteroles didn't come out right.
I didn't have, uh, a scale, so I had to go by eye, and that is very hard, man.
You can't make it.
Mama Mia.
Esther also managed to mess up her first batch of profiteroles.
Attempt number two isn't going much better.
There is something wrong with this flour.
Esther, what's that for?
I'm making the batter again.
Something went wrong.
I could tell right when I touched them.
Okay, you're making a choux pastry for dessert.
Yes.
Concerns?
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm deeply concerned...
Concerned that they'll take 12, 15 minutes to cook...
Right.
15 minutes to cool down.
Right.
Are you mad?
If I don't have the dessert ready on time, then we forfeit the dessert course, and all those votes will automatically go to the red team.
If it's not cooked in the center, you're screwed.
Right.
I just need Gordon to get out of my face.
600 hors d'oeuvres for the Hollywood cocktail party must be served in just 30 minutes, but Gordon isn't happy with progress so far.
I mean, I'm deeply concerned.
If it's not cooked in the center, you're screwed.
Right.
One-bite wonders, yeah?
Let's go.
Both teams are putting final touches to their gazpachos.
I want you guys to try this.
Okay.
More salt?
Yeah.
So we can put, um, just, like, a dash of this on the bottom and then the red over the top.
Giuseppe, how's it going now?
All right.
All right, that doesn't-- you don't sound positive, buddy.
Over here.
Over here.
Look at this.
Hey, look at this guy.
Okay.
Um...
It needs-- it needs something green.
Do we have mint or basil?
Tastes awesome.
It's good?
All right.
While Giuseppe is delighted with his red team dessert,
Esther on the blue team is having more problems with her second batch of pastry dough.
What is all that in there?
Yeah, my choux dough-- it doesn't work.
That's all choux dough?
Yeah.
It's .
How much did you make?
I was trying to do enough for, like, 100, and, um, , just in case some burned, but...
I am gonna make a third batch of dough, and this time it's gonna work.
I know I can do this.
I have to do it.
Derrick is up against Christine in the beef hors'ovres.
As the blue team puts the finishes touches on their mini beef Wellington,
Chef Ramsay is concerned with the size.
Is that right, the pastry being that thick on there?
This is very, very thick.
I have an extra pastry dough circle on top, and Gordon comes by and he's like,
"tis supposed to be an hors d'oeuvre, not a freakin' whatever."
So he's like, "this is too thick."
Do you want to pull the top layer off?
There's a lot of pastry there...
Just like that, guys, for very little beef.
Go.
Do it.
Let's go.
Red team, who's serving?
Red team, who's serving?
Uh, it was supposed--
Who's serving from the red team?
I'm not sure, chef.
Not sure. .
The lights are on, but everyone's off to Italy.
I have nightmares at night of Gordon.
With time running out,
Joe is worried the red team's beef dish is beyond redemption.
You're gonna serve a raw-- raw meat?
We're--we're gonna sear it off with the torch-- with the torch?
Yes.
I've never seen anyone blowtorch raw beef...
Okay.
In a tartare.
I think you're taking a big risk serving raw beef to this whole big crowd of random people.
11 minutes to go.
After screwing up her profiterole dough twice,
Esther has finally mastered batch number three.
These are good.
I put the third dough in the oven, and they look beautiful.
I'm so relieved.
The final task is to pipe in a perfectly mixed chocolate mousse filling.
Ben.
Yes, chef.
The mix is broken.
Just taste the mix.
It's like eating a mouthful of olive oil, butter-- broken, greasy.
I've done this dough three times, and you're telling me the filling's wrong now?
Suzy.
Yeah.
Show me the bag.
Here you go, chef.
Yeah.
You're piping it, and you're piping broken mousse.
This whole course has been a frickin' disaster.
Yes, chef.
'Cause that is disgusting.
They're not gonna let us serve this.
With the filling ruined and time running out, the blue team must come up with a new dessert...
Fast.
Let's do fruit.
Yes.
Strawberries, kumquats, basil.
Perfect.
Done.
Go.
The only thing we have time to make is berries.
That's it.
And do we even have time to do that?
You okay, Ben?
I'm losing it here.
Ben, what is the dessert now, please?
Lightly macerated seasonal strawberries and kumquats and a chiffonade of basil.
So how do they eat them out of the cup?
Is it a spoon, teaspoon-- what is it?
It's a fruit shot.
I can sell anything, chef.
I'm taking it up there.
I really think that this whole challenge is gonna come down to dessert, and if this is what it's going to be with only minutes left on the clock, we are screwed.
Blue team--they actually put together at the last moment a sloppy dessert-- some fruit put in some paper, and you're supposed to just shove it down like this.
Come on, this is a high-life people.
You have to give them something that looks elegant.
Last minute!
Blue team, come on!
See those ones right there?
Put some basil on those.
Yeah.
All right, stay focused, girls.
Okay, let's go!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Good.
Well done.
Bring 'em up front!
Kumquat fruit salad with cream.
That's the worst dish I've ever seen compiled in MasterChef.
And on top of that, that is the worst dish that's ever left my kitchen.
I could cry.
I could fricking cry.
For this Hollywood cocktail party challenge, the red and blue teams have each made 300 hors d'oeuvres.
The guests will try each of the team's three courses and vote for their favorites.
Whichever team wins the most courses will be the winner.
First up--the vegetarian course.
Suzy's tomato mint gazpacho for the blue team is taking on Adrien's duo of gazpachos for the red team.
I've got a chilled mint gazpacho.
This is really a head-to-head.
His dish doesn't look as pretty as mine.
It's kind of heavy-handed.
I've got this, like, cool, chilled gazpacho with, like, this flower on top that's, like, edible and beautiful.
And it's, like, a really "sexy" dish for, like, this party.
Okay, so, let's try each one.
Let's shoot 'em.
Let's do it.
Cheers.
You have a very beautiful smile...
So you have one point already.
Thank you.
I think it's too salty for me.
Too salty?
A little too salty, yeah.
Okay.
And Adrien-- a double gazpacho.
Everyone taste one each.
The balance of the sweetness and the saltiness is very good.
Thank you.
The green doesn't want to liberate itself from the glass.
Maybe this will work.
No, but the thing is you cannot serve that in a restaurant, because it doesn't go down.
For the meat course, the blue team is serving a mini beef Wellington.
And the red team has a torched beef tartare.
I have a play on beef Wellington.
Cheers, guys.
You got it in a bite?
No, she didn't do it in a bite.
Do you see?
That's the problem with the 2-bite hors d'oeuvre.
Eventually you'll get a piece of portobello mushroom...
It's good.
Dribbling out of your lip.
Okay, now we'll go to the red team.
This is the classic take on beef tartare--torched.
One bite.
Cheers to one bite.
Cheers.
Good?
Very fresh tasting.
Yeah, it's got a nice tang to it.
Got a little more, yeah, tang.
All right, so you gotta think about it, 'cause we're gonna ask you to vote.
This is very big.
Finally, it's time for dessert.
Can the blue team's 5-minute fruit cup stand a chance against Giuseppe's elegant fruit tart?
Hello, ladies, we have your first bite of springtime here.
Fresh, local strawberries with kumquats, just a hint of basil, and a little bit of whipped cream.
It's a guilt-free way to end your evening.
Give it a try.
It's a shooter.
Just take it right in, all in one bite.
Try to keep it in your mouth.
Mmm.
And then from the red team-- Giuseppe, what did you make?
All right, we have a pastry with a sweet mascarpone cheese, raspberries, blueberries, and a little touch of agave.
If I don't win this this time,
I'm gonna be completely devastated, I swear to God.
They were both amazing...
Okay.
But that one did it for me.
Oh, man, I was shocked.
She liked Ben's dessert better.
I can't believe it.
I have to go with the red, actually.
Oh.
That was a little difficult to eat, but this was just nice and classic for me.
And it was good, and the texture was there.
Split decision.
Thanks, guys.
All three courses have been served.
The guests mark their voting cards as the party winds down.
When we hit a hiccup, we kept going.
I could not feel more proud of my girls at this point.
Each and every one of them performed flawlessly.
Two, three--blue!
(Announcer the votes have been counted.
(Announcer the votes have been counted.
The first team to win two of the three courses will win the challenge, while the losers will face the dreaded pressure test where at least one person will be eliminated from MasterChef.
As far as looks and taste, I think we nailed it, and we're gonna win.
The first course was a delicious vegetable course.
One gazpacho more classic, one gazpacho double-flavored with guac on the bottom and tomato on top-- one team came up ahead on the gazpacho challenge, and it with 64% of the vote.
Red team.
So the red team-- a little bit more complex, perhaps, a little bit sexy in design.
We really liked the way it looked, the double flavor, so excellent job.
All right, the beef.
Derrick, you look excited.
I was just excited for beef, you know.
All right.
Well, you were in charge of your team's beef hors d'oeuvre, the tartare of tenderloin.
Blue team, we had the beef Wellington.
Who was in charge of that?
I was.
Christine.
This is where it gets interesting.
One team somehow was able to garner 100% of the votes.
Wow.
What?
Every guest that dined tonight that enjoyed the hors d'oeuvres...
Enjoyed the blue team's.
Oh, my God.
You win.
Rock out, girl.
People underestimate me as a cook.
When you put me against the wall, then I will usually come out fighting.
You just never know what I'm gonna bring.
Red team, for me, the tartare was bland.
It needed help.
I knew the tartare was risky.
But I didn't expect a full sweep, and nobody did.
It's neck and neck, onto the blue team, one to the red team.
And it's all down to the desserts.
Blue team, you came up with a seasonal spring fruits with a cream.
Red team...
You came out with a puff pastry.
When it comes down to the dessert,
I'm feeling like it's over.
It would take a miracle for our fruit cup to win over Giuseppe's.
It was a very narrow margin.
The winners of the dessert course...
With 53% of the vote.
Red team.
I feel great.
I gave actually the victory to my team.
This is a beautiful Hollywood ending.
It couldn't be better than that.
Being in Gordon's kitchen and winning the challenge is awesome.
Good job.
I'm proud of my team, proud of me, and we nailed it.
No pressure test for us.
I feel like a failure as a leader, because they were trusting me to lead them to a win.
It came down to dessert, and it was Esther's fault that we lost.
Blue team, you'll be facing a very demanding pressure test.
Get some rest.
Good night.
Let's go.
Come over, guys, please, let's go.
Since my beef Wellington was so amazing last night, it just blows that I'm standing here.
I'm angry, because it's not my fault.
My team is facing a pressure test.
Had I been able to deliver the dessert I wanted to,
I don't think we would be here today.
Red team, you were the real stars last night, and you will not be facing a pressure test.
Make your way up to the gallery.
Watch and learn.
I feel amazing that I don't have to go on to the pressure test, 'cause nobody has any idea what it's gonna be, but we do know that somebody's going home, and I know that that somebody is not me.
Okay, for this pressure test, you all will have to create one of these-- a stunning, delicious, eye-capturing layered cake...
A masterpiece built on textures, taste, and visual impact.
I've been baking since about age ten, so I'm extreme comfortable baking cakes.
You'll have two hours to make a cake with a minimum of six layers of sponge.
Why six layers?
Why--why do you need to eat six layers of cake?
Okay, on to your stations, please.
And remember, whoever has the worst layered cake in this pressure test-- at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Two hours...
From now!
Off you go.
In this pressure test, the cooks will have two hours to produce a delectable six-layer cake.
The judges will be looking for perfect construction and presentation as well as amazing taste.
I'm just gonna go with a standard vanilla chiffon cake.
I'm gonna do a cream cheese frosting and maybe add a little bit of basil and strawberry flavoring to that.
I'm gonna do an ice cream sundae, basically, in a layer cake, so we're gonna do banana.
We're gonna have a little bit of hazelnut.
So that's kind of the game plan right now.
Six layers.
For a professional chef, that's a tall task, right?
Right, right.
You have to have the technicality of baking-- architecture, construction, flavor profiles.
Chemistry.
The base of the cake has to be a thick layer so it stands up when you slice that wedge.
Mm-hmm.
The layers in between don't have to be as thick as the bottom base...
Right.
Otherwise it becomes top-heavy.
It's gonna topple.
All right, Ben.
How are we doing?
Hello.
It's gonna be an awful elimination today.
Who do you think now is at risk of going home?
I don't want anybody to go home.
From personal conversations, Tracy hasn't baked a lot.
Hey, Tracy.
How are you today?
There's a lot of talk about you being, uh, a little unexperienced in making desserts
I'm actually not the top baker in this competition.
Who do you think is gonna struggle here?
Um, me.
Christine, talk to me about your cake.
I'm gonna do a raspberry, strawberry and apricot jam in the middle.
Jam?
That's nice.
Yes, preserve.
Okay, good.
But I'm gonna pipe a little icing on the outside, so it doesn't go...
Pffft.
Christine, 30 seconds with you, I need a bottle.
I have some rum.
All right, Suzy, what are you doing?
I'm doing a chocolate sponge cake and in between I'm doing a raspberry whip and then a pecan crust on the sides...
Okay.
And a ganache on top.
Super simple, no garnish, no nothing.
Yeah.
All right, Ben...
Yes, chef.
How are you feeling?
I'm feeling very good, Chef.
I'm making a cake that I've made many times.
This is a pumpkin carrot sponge.
In between the pumpkin, what are you putting in there?
I'm doing a cream cheese frosting, and I'm gonna candy some hazelnuts to coat the outside and give it kind of a nice rustic but still elegant .
Hi, Esther.
How are we doing?
Chef, how are you?
What's wrong?
You seem s- so quiet and down and defeated.
I'm a little down.
What's wrong?
I'm not defeated.
I'm just focused.
Okay, good.
You have as good a chance as anybody in this kitchen to pull it out and to win.
Okay, folks, one hour left, and one person is going home.
While the cakes are cooling, the cooks are able to prepare their icing, which will be critical to the construction and flavor of their final cake.
On the sponge cake side, everyone seemed to bake 'em, get 'em out of the oven, and are slicing them pretty good.
I got quite excited about Ben Starr's pumpkin carrot.
However, there's no aeration in the cake...
Sure.
So it's a weighted mass.
Yeah, it's like an orange doorstop.
It's about that thick, and it looks heavy as hell.
Yeah.
Esther is still whipping her frosting.
Yeah, that's not a good sign.
If you're just whipping your frosting now, by the time you pipe it on the cake, it's gonna be melted butter, you know?
Yeah.
So they really have some risk with timing now.
We're coming up to 30 minutes left.
You should now start constructing the layers.
The key is just to keep this damn cake up.
Doing just little adjustments here to make sure it's level.
Christine, how many is on there?
You're missing two layers, yeah?
Yeah, I have it right here, chef.
Okay, good.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
I just layer it up, and I'm really not paying attention to how thick the icing is and how thick the jam is.
Just over 15 minutes to go.
stupid cake.
That's it, Tracy, all the way around.
Let the palette knife do the work.
I'm liking the consistency.
I'm liking the layers.
It's--it's standing up there nicely.
Then I realize
I've made a crucial error.
No, it's not on.
I didn't put the thing underneath.
You know those little cake rounds that help you move the cake from place to place?
Yeah, I forgot it.
Put 'em next to each other, then you can slide it over.
I literally lift the cake up and put it onto this glass round.
However, the shape of it is just not the same.
Five minutes to go.
Your cakes should now be assembled and you should be putting your finishing touches on there.
I'm freaking out a little bit.
Time is running out, and I'm just trying to get the caked filled.
I'm throwing icing in there.
I'm throwing curd in there.
I'm throwing fresh fruit in there, and I've lost count of the layers.
Last minute!
Really?
My icing is melting everywhere.
Start putting those final touches.
30 seconds to go!
I'm in a mad dash to even give them a cake I can present.
This is just stupid.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
Six, five, four, three, one, and stop!
it.
Stupid Cake.
Five, four, three, two, one, and stop!
it.
stupid cake.
That has been the most difficult pressure test ever so far in the history of MasterChef.
And from here, they look amazing.
But at least one of you... will be leaving MasterChef.
Okay, Ben Starr, let's go.
All right, Ben.
Yes, Chef.
Are you okay?
I'm wonderful.
Talk to me.
I-I've been perfecting this cake for five years, and I believe this is the first time
I have had the ingredients to be able to give you something that represents me truly as a cook.
Okay.
And the ability to finally do that in this competition is overwhelming for me.
Great, okay, good.
Describe the cake.
Chef, this is a pumpkin carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and candied hazelnuts.
Here we go.
Oh, my God.
I swear to God, that looks phenomenal...
Thank you, chef.
Absolute sublime.
That is extraordinary...
Absolute magic on a fork.
I'm just letting it finish.
My mouth just had an orgasm.
Sorry.
I feel like I have finally spoken to the judges my language, and they've understood it for the first time.
This is Ben Starr.
This is what I want to do with the rest of my life.
Suzy, let's bring it up.
My cake looks amazing.
It's decadent.
It's luscious.
And I hope they love it.
Today I made a ganache and pecan-encrusd cake with chantilly cream on top.
Each layer also has just a chantilly whip with a hint of raspberry as well.
When you mentioned crusted, uh, it definitely is that.
Crusted.
This one's like-- we're gonna kinda have to do one of these numbers, like...
The chantilly--I really wish there was more of it, just some more mouthfeel to kind of balance out with the cake.
You know, when I saw you putting the ganache on top of the cake, it was, like, perfect.
And then you went, and you put this--
I don't even know what this is.
It looks like kinda mold growing up a tree on the outside.
So there was a minimalistic kind of perfection to this cake that kinda went to hell.
I mean, this is-- it's gross.
I literally just got served, like, a piece of humble pie.
And I'm realizing that there are people in this competition that could possibly be, like, way better than me.
Okay, Tracy, come on up.
I'm thinking, please, God, just let the cake stand long enough for them to cut it and put it on their plate.
I made a sweet basil and citrus-infused syrup and blended that in with a sweet cream cheese.
So, Tracy, there's two things I notice.
"A"--the asymmetrical construction of the cake, and "B" is the frown on your face.
It's good.
I think that the orange zest and basil really kind of makes it pop a little bit and gives it some brightness and flavor.
It's simple, clean, and, um, intriguing.
Thank you.
Jennifer, let's go.
What is it?
It is a play on a banana split.
So you have your strawberries on top, your nuts on the side, your banana on the inside, your chocolate on the inside.
That looks amazing.
The chocolate goes brilliantly with the sponge, and it's sweetened by the strawberries.
And it tastes delicious.
Great job.
Esther, please come forward.
It's a lemon raspberry cake.
It's filled with a lemon curd, fresh raspberries.
And then there's a sponge cake brushed with a raspberry and lemon syrup.
It's very, very sweet, almost overly so.
Something about layer cake shows the level of finesse...
Right.
In the construction, but it looks like it's been put together in a panic.
I'm struggling with the lack of balance.
It's got that sort of overpowering acidic but sweetness to it, and it doesn't really work.
I'm frustrated, because I could've done that so much better.
I ran out of time.
Okay, Christine.
It's layers of apricots, raspberries, strawberries, and a little bit of hazelnut liqueur, just layer upon layer.
It seems a little bit...
Kind of, uh...
Sweet-on-sweet, one-dimensional, no contrast, like, uh, boring.
Okay, Christine, the frosting on the outside is what?
It's buttercream.
Sponge is perfect.
The cake's lacking personality.
And it's pretty sort of run-of-the-mill.
All of you, come down, please.
I'm really disappointed in myself.
Like, this is by far the worst I've ever done, and it sucks that it was during a pressure test.
Two hour to produce a stunning six-layered delicious cake.
Sadly, at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Right.
Tracy, step forward.
Jennifer, step forward.
Ben Starr, step forward...
And take you, Tracy, and Jennifer upstairs.
Congratulations.
Let's go.
Okay, Esther,
Christine, Suzy, clearly all three in the bottom half.
Suzy, it wasn't your best shot.
Christine, on the back of your performance with the beef Wellington, the cake didn't match anywhere near what you produced in the last challenge.
Esther--awkward, it didn't really work, and a bizarre texture.
Christine, step forward, please.
Oh, my God.
You've done a lot inside this competition.
And at times, you've really handled the pressure brilliantly.
The three of us are proud of you.
And I'm sure right now your dad and your son are equally as proud of you.
I'm sorry.
After the six-layer cake pressure test, it's down to the last three.
One of them will be going home.
Christine.
You've done a lot inside this competition.
And at times, you've really handled the pressure brilliantly.
Christine,
I'm sorry, take your apron...
Upstairs to the balcony.
I think I almost peed myself.
People keep underestimating me.
I'm still here to win it, so you just better watch it.
Oh, my God.
At this point,
I think I just got hit by a truck.
And I've got this feeling inside of me, that, like, this is my time.
Esther, Suzy, we've got the neural engineer versus the lawyer.
It's down to me and Suzy.
I quit my job, I'm here, and this opportunity means the world to me.
I'm not ready to go home.
Suzy, what frustrated all three of us was the fact that you had something on the verge of stunning, but the add-ons and the pecans just didn't work.
You don't know where to draw the line in the sand.
Esther, you're a very technical, intelligent cook.
But you looked out of your depth across those two hours.
Esther, step forward.
Oh, my God.
Esther...
Take your apron off.
Your time is done in MasterChef.
Promise...
I'm promising.
Stay on that journey.
I will.
I'm not gonna give up.
I'm not gonna go back to being just a lawyer.
It takes a lot of courage and conviction to quit your job, but it's absolutely worth it when you're pursuing your passion.
Food excites me.
And I feel empowered leaving MasterChef.
The world is my oyster.
Suzy, sometimes across these challenges, you go in denial.
And there's parts of you that produce sort of fake ideas that unfortunately don't really wash.
So we tell you to make you better, and you seem to ignore that advice.
Take the advice, run with it, and come back strong.
You may be walking on thin ice, but the ganache was delicious.
Take your apron upstairs and join the rest of them.
Let's go.
I never, ever, ever in my life ever want to do a pressure test again.
That was my hell.
That was honestly the worst feeling
I've ever had in my life.
That was so much disappointment in myself.
I'm never gonna be in there again.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Next time on MasterChef...
The biggest mystery box we've ever had.
One cook's aggression is unleashed.
I'm not here to make friends.
And one judge's temper boils over.
Show these people the same respect they show you.
If not, I'm gonna personally come over there and throw you out of here.
And another home cook's MasterChef dreams will come to an end.
I am speechless.
Previously on MasterChef, one home cook exploded in the kitchen.
I don't think my dish is the worst dish here.
I think you're wrong.
His arrogance-- it's stinking up this kitchen.
And a new rivalry erupted.
I told Jennifer I think she's a bitch, and I'll cook her under the table any day of the week.
At the end of the day, one more homecook's MasterChef dreams came to a bitter end.
Jenny, your time is done in MasterChef.
Tonight, the cooks are thrown into the lion's den.
You're not gonna work like a little pig in my kitchen.
Gordon Ramsay has lost his mind.
I want that mess cleaned up.
Worst dish I've ever seen in MasterChef.
And on top of that, that is the worst dish that has ever left my kitchen.
Now just 12 cooks remain to battle it out in front of three culinary heavyweights.
stupid cake.
At stake--$1/4 million, and the title...
cake!
Of MasterChef!
MasterChef 2x10 Top 12 Compete Original Air Date on July 11, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The remaining 12 amateur cooks have been brought to the rooftop of an elite Hollywood hotel.
Let's go.
Come through.
They'll be split into opposing teams for today's high-end catering challenge.
The losing team will face a pressure test where one more cook's MasterChef dream will die.
Welcome to London West Hollywood.
This hotel has a special place in my heart, 'cause it houses my Los Angeles restaurant.
You are gonna be cooking for a Hollywood party right here.
All right.
You'll be split into two teams, and each team will have to conceptualize, prepare, and cook different hors d'oeuvres for our v.I.P. Guest list.
The courses are...
Vegetable, beef, and a dessert.
All of you are gonna be cooking in my Michelin-star kitchen downstairs.
Yes!
Yes!
We had two stunning dishes from our last challenge.
Based on that, Ben and Christian will be picking your teams.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
I couldn't have asked to be a team captain for a better team challenge.
I can't wait to just start the game and take Ben down.
Ben, first choice.
Chef, I've seen at least one contestant so far produce a presentation like this.
I'm really, really hoping I'm gonna be on Ben's team.
I think Christian's amazing, but he's really aggressive in the kitchen.
My first selection is definitely going to be Suzy.
Suzy.
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
First-round draft pick.
The fact that Ben chose me first shows that I am one of the top dogs in MasterChef.
Christian, who is it, please?
Adrien.
Okay, Ben Starr.
Tracy.
Tracy.
Wow.
All right.
I'm gonna go with Alejandra.
Okay, good.
Jen.
Wow.
Derrick.
Wow.
Esther.
I'm going with, uh, Giuseppe.
All right, Giuseppe.
I'm with the boys today.
Whoo!
I'm last again, almost, and I'm thinking,
"please, I do not want to be on Christian's team."
I've seen this person produce incredible miracles under pressure, and that person is Christine.
Christine.
Christine for the full house-- all-girl team.
Not all.
Okay.
Nobody wants to pick me.
That's fine.
I don't know why, because I'm 2-0, and I perform really well on these team challenges.
So all it is is just fueling my fire right now.
Ben!
Yes, chef.
Looks like you've got Charlie's Angels there.
I had a feeling Ben was gonna be picking a lot of the girls, which is fine.
Girls--um, I like 'em, but they're a little bit more dramatic than guys.
And I think when it comes to being in a kitchen, you can't really have a lot of drama.
You've got 90 minutes to prep three stunning hors d'oeuvres.
We have 90 minutes to cater a Hollywood party.
Hello!
Can somebody bring a straitjacket over here?
Gordon Ramsay has lost his mind.
Your time starts now.
Off you go.
Run.
Each team has 90 minutes to devise and create 300 luxury hors d'oeuvres from the ingredients in Chef Ramsay's kitchen.
Each one of you is gonna take ownership of a single course.
I am not a dictator.
If you want your team to produce brilliant results, you have to empower them to do something that they're passionate about.
First course is veggie.
Does anybody have-- I can do veggie.
You can do veggie?
Gazpacho.
Okay.
Beef.
Yes?
Beef.
Me beef?
Sure.
Do you want rib eye, short ribs, or filet?
Filet.
Filet.
Christine's doing an open-faced Wellington, a little bit of puff pastry, mushrooms, filet, creme fraiche--done.
Last course is Esther's beautiful, dainty chocolate profiteroles.
Listen, I'm your bitch.
I'm here to support you.
Let's go, guys.
Ben is running his team in a democratic fashion.
But on the red team, Christian's making all the calls.
All right, vegetable?
Gazpacho.
Christian has a menu mapped out in his head, and that's what we're going with.
Some of his ideas, I'm wondering if they're a little too risky or edgy.
Beef--we'll do a little tartare.
Yes.
A little pepper-- we'll torch it.
I'm in charge of the beef tartare, and I've never made beef tartare.
I mean, hell, I've never even eaten beef tartare.
It's a risky thing, 'cause, you know, it's raw meat.
And for the dessert?
We'll do profiterole with filling.
Okay, let's do this, guys.
Christian and Ben, please.
Ben!
Ben!
Yes, chef!
Two seconds, please.
Christian, let's go.
Quick.
So Gordon calls me and Ben over, um, for a little powwow to go over our menus.
Ben!
Let's go, Ben!
Come on!
Now!
I don't have time for this !
I just had to yell at Ben to get over there, because he's wasting my time.
If Gordon can yell in the kitchen,
I think, uh, I can yell in the kitchen, too.
Talk to me about the dishes.
Vegetable--we have a gazpacho shooter.
Christian.
They must have been listening to us, 'cause, um, Adrien went with a gazpacho.
Okay, so are you two copying each other?
No, chef.
The list of ingredients here is extraordinary,
I mean, really extraordinary.
Desserts.
On a high-- what is it?
Esther is on desert.
She's doing very dainty chocolate profiteroles with a lattice of chocolate on top.
Wow.
Ambitious.
Um, a profiterole, again, and, um...
Wow.
It's the same dishes competing.
Have the balls to change...
Mm-hmm.
If it's not hitting perfection.
You're the captains for a reason.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
Listen, we don't have to change courses here.
All we have to do is make sure ours tastes better.
Esther, look at me.
Look at me.
You're not gonna work like a little pig in my kitchen.
Yes, chef.
I want that mess cleaned up.
I'm cleaning everything up right now.
Despite Gordon's fear of similar menus,
Adrien and Suzy are both going ahead with their gazpachos.
I've done gazpacho a couple of times before.
I'm gonna keep it simple and keep it, like, really delicious and fresh.
Adrien, how we doing?
Doing all right.
I need to adjust my seasonings.
I'm doing a gazpacho again, but I'm doing a duo.
Are you doing them at the same time or layered?
Yeah.
It's going in the same cup, so just layered.
Make sure they're the same thickness.
Obviously, this looks like puree, and this one's thinner.
So just be careful about that.
Not only do I find out that Adrien's doing a gazpacho, uh, but he's doing a duo.
He's like the one-upper.
I'm so screwed.
Meanwhile, Christine is trying to ensure her cooked beef dish beats Derrick's raw beef tartare.
I just went through a pressure test where I had to cook a filet, so hopefully I can do it again.
!
Only concern is that I overcook, which I hope I don't do.
Do I cut out--cut out a thick steak like that?
Oh, that's fine.
I have Derrick on the beef, and raw meat's very risky.
But I'm sticking with my plan, and, uh, you know, that's what chefs do.
Esther is going up against Giuseppe on the dessert course.
He's ditched a disastrous batch of profiteroles and is now switching to fruit tarts.
The profiteroles didn't come out right.
I didn't have, uh, a scale, so I had to go by eye, and that is very hard, man.
You can't make it.
Mama Mia.
Esther also managed to mess up her first batch of profiteroles.
Attempt number two isn't going much better.
There is something wrong with this flour.
Esther, what's that for?
I'm making the batter again.
Something went wrong.
I could tell right when I touched them.
Okay, you're making a choux pastry for dessert.
Yes.
Concerns?
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm deeply concerned...
Concerned that they'll take 12, 15 minutes to cook...
Right.
15 minutes to cool down.
Right.
Are you mad?
If I don't have the dessert ready on time, then we forfeit the dessert course, and all those votes will automatically go to the red team.
If it's not cooked in the center, you're screwed.
Right.
I just need Gordon to get out of my face.
600 hors d'oeuvres for the Hollywood cocktail party must be served in just 30 minutes, but Gordon isn't happy with progress so far.
I mean, I'm deeply concerned.
If it's not cooked in the center, you're screwed.
Right.
One-bite wonders, yeah?
Let's go.
Both teams are putting final touches to their gazpachos.
I want you guys to try this.
Okay.
More salt?
Yeah.
So we can put, um, just, like, a dash of this on the bottom and then the red over the top.
Giuseppe, how's it going now?
All right.
All right, that doesn't-- you don't sound positive, buddy.
Over here.
Over here.
Look at this.
Hey, look at this guy.
Okay.
Um...
It needs-- it needs something green.
Do we have mint or basil?
Tastes awesome.
It's good?
All right.
While Giuseppe is delighted with his red team dessert,
Esther on the blue team is having more problems with her second batch of pastry dough.
What is all that in there?
Yeah, my choux dough-- it doesn't work.
That's all choux dough?
Yeah.
It's .
How much did you make?
I was trying to do enough for, like, 100, and, um, , just in case some burned, but...
I am gonna make a third batch of dough, and this time it's gonna work.
I know I can do this.
I have to do it.
Derrick is up against Christine in the beef hors'ovres.
As the blue team puts the finishes touches on their mini beef Wellington,
Chef Ramsay is concerned with the size.
Is that right, the pastry being that thick on there?
This is very, very thick.
I have an extra pastry dough circle on top, and Gordon comes by and he's like,
"tis supposed to be an hors d'oeuvre, not a freakin' whatever."
So he's like, "this is too thick."
Do you want to pull the top layer off?
There's a lot of pastry there...
Just like that, guys, for very little beef.
Go.
Do it.
Let's go.
Red team, who's serving?
Red team, who's serving?
Uh, it was supposed--
Who's serving from the red team?
I'm not sure, chef.
Not sure. .
The lights are on, but everyone's off to Italy.
I have nightmares at night of Gordon.
With time running out,
Joe is worried the red team's beef dish is beyond redemption.
You're gonna serve a raw-- raw meat?
We're--we're gonna sear it off with the torch-- with the torch?
Yes.
I've never seen anyone blowtorch raw beef...
Okay.
In a tartare.
I think you're taking a big risk serving raw beef to this whole big crowd of random people.
11 minutes to go.
After screwing up her profiterole dough twice,
Esther has finally mastered batch number three.
These are good.
I put the third dough in the oven, and they look beautiful.
I'm so relieved.
The final task is to pipe in a perfectly mixed chocolate mousse filling.
Ben.
Yes, chef.
The mix is broken.
Just taste the mix.
It's like eating a mouthful of olive oil, butter-- broken, greasy.
I've done this dough three times, and you're telling me the filling's wrong now?
Suzy.
Yeah.
Show me the bag.
Here you go, chef.
Yeah.
You're piping it, and you're piping broken mousse.
This whole course has been a frickin' disaster.
Yes, chef.
'Cause that is disgusting.
They're not gonna let us serve this.
With the filling ruined and time running out, the blue team must come up with a new dessert...
Fast.
Let's do fruit.
Yes.
Strawberries, kumquats, basil.
Perfect.
Done.
Go.
The only thing we have time to make is berries.
That's it.
And do we even have time to do that?
You okay, Ben?
I'm losing it here.
Ben, what is the dessert now, please?
Lightly macerated seasonal strawberries and kumquats and a chiffonade of basil.
So how do they eat them out of the cup?
Is it a spoon, teaspoon-- what is it?
It's a fruit shot.
I can sell anything, chef.
I'm taking it up there.
I really think that this whole challenge is gonna come down to dessert, and if this is what it's going to be with only minutes left on the clock, we are screwed.
Blue team--they actually put together at the last moment a sloppy dessert-- some fruit put in some paper, and you're supposed to just shove it down like this.
Come on, this is a high-life people.
You have to give them something that looks elegant.
Last minute!
Blue team, come on!
See those ones right there?
Put some basil on those.
Yeah.
All right, stay focused, girls.
Okay, let's go!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Good.
Well done.
Bring 'em up front!
Kumquat fruit salad with cream.
That's the worst dish I've ever seen compiled in MasterChef.
And on top of that, that is the worst dish that's ever left my kitchen.
I could cry.
I could fricking cry.
For this Hollywood cocktail party challenge, the red and blue teams have each made 300 hors d'oeuvres.
The guests will try each of the team's three courses and vote for their favorites.
Whichever team wins the most courses will be the winner.
First up--the vegetarian course.
Suzy's tomato mint gazpacho for the blue team is taking on Adrien's duo of gazpachos for the red team.
I've got a chilled mint gazpacho.
This is really a head-to-head.
His dish doesn't look as pretty as mine.
It's kind of heavy-handed.
I've got this, like, cool, chilled gazpacho with, like, this flower on top that's, like, edible and beautiful.
And it's, like, a really "sexy" dish for, like, this party.
Okay, so, let's try each one.
Let's shoot 'em.
Let's do it.
Cheers.
You have a very beautiful smile...
So you have one point already.
Thank you.
I think it's too salty for me.
Too salty?
A little too salty, yeah.
Okay.
And Adrien-- a double gazpacho.
Everyone taste one each.
The balance of the sweetness and the saltiness is very good.
Thank you.
The green doesn't want to liberate itself from the glass.
Maybe this will work.
No, but the thing is you cannot serve that in a restaurant, because it doesn't go down.
For the meat course, the blue team is serving a mini beef Wellington.
And the red team has a torched beef tartare.
I have a play on beef Wellington.
Cheers, guys.
You got it in a bite?
No, she didn't do it in a bite.
Do you see?
That's the problem with the 2-bite hors d'oeuvre.
Eventually you'll get a piece of portobello mushroom...
It's good.
Dribbling out of your lip.
Okay, now we'll go to the red team.
This is the classic take on beef tartare--torched.
One bite.
Cheers to one bite.
Cheers.
Good?
Very fresh tasting.
Yeah, it's got a nice tang to it.
Got a little more, yeah, tang.
All right, so you gotta think about it, 'cause we're gonna ask you to vote.
This is very big.
Finally, it's time for dessert.
Can the blue team's 5-minute fruit cup stand a chance against Giuseppe's elegant fruit tart?
Hello, ladies, we have your first bite of springtime here.
Fresh, local strawberries with kumquats, just a hint of basil, and a little bit of whipped cream.
It's a guilt-free way to end your evening.
Give it a try.
It's a shooter.
Just take it right in, all in one bite.
Try to keep it in your mouth.
Mmm.
And then from the red team-- Giuseppe, what did you make?
All right, we have a pastry with a sweet mascarpone cheese, raspberries, blueberries, and a little touch of agave.
If I don't win this this time,
I'm gonna be completely devastated, I swear to God.
They were both amazing...
Okay.
But that one did it for me.
Oh, man, I was shocked.
She liked Ben's dessert better.
I can't believe it.
I have to go with the red, actually.
Oh.
That was a little difficult to eat, but this was just nice and classic for me.
And it was good, and the texture was there.
Split decision.
Thanks, guys.
All three courses have been served.
The guests mark their voting cards as the party winds down.
When we hit a hiccup, we kept going.
I could not feel more proud of my girls at this point.
Each and every one of them performed flawlessly.
Two, three--blue!
(Announcer the votes have been counted.
(Announcer the votes have been counted.
The first team to win two of the three courses will win the challenge, while the losers will face the dreaded pressure test where at least one person will be eliminated from MasterChef.
As far as looks and taste, I think we nailed it, and we're gonna win.
The first course was a delicious vegetable course.
One gazpacho more classic, one gazpacho double-flavored with guac on the bottom and tomato on top-- one team came up ahead on the gazpacho challenge, and it with 64% of the vote.
Red team.
So the red team-- a little bit more complex, perhaps, a little bit sexy in design.
We really liked the way it looked, the double flavor, so excellent job.
All right, the beef.
Derrick, you look excited.
I was just excited for beef, you know.
All right.
Well, you were in charge of your team's beef hors d'oeuvre, the tartare of tenderloin.
Blue team, we had the beef Wellington.
Who was in charge of that?
I was.
Christine.
This is where it gets interesting.
One team somehow was able to garner 100% of the votes.
Wow.
What?
Every guest that dined tonight that enjoyed the hors d'oeuvres...
Enjoyed the blue team's.
Oh, my God.
You win.
Rock out, girl.
People underestimate me as a cook.
When you put me against the wall, then I will usually come out fighting.
You just never know what I'm gonna bring.
Red team, for me, the tartare was bland.
It needed help.
I knew the tartare was risky.
But I didn't expect a full sweep, and nobody did.
It's neck and neck, onto the blue team, one to the red team.
And it's all down to the desserts.
Blue team, you came up with a seasonal spring fruits with a cream.
Red team...
You came out with a puff pastry.
When it comes down to the dessert,
I'm feeling like it's over.
It would take a miracle for our fruit cup to win over Giuseppe's.
It was a very narrow margin.
The winners of the dessert course...
With 53% of the vote.
Red team.
I feel great.
I gave actually the victory to my team.
This is a beautiful Hollywood ending.
It couldn't be better than that.
Being in Gordon's kitchen and winning the challenge is awesome.
Good job.
I'm proud of my team, proud of me, and we nailed it.
No pressure test for us.
I feel like a failure as a leader, because they were trusting me to lead them to a win.
It came down to dessert, and it was Esther's fault that we lost.
Blue team, you'll be facing a very demanding pressure test.
Get some rest.
Good night.
Let's go.
Come over, guys, please, let's go.
Since my beef Wellington was so amazing last night, it just blows that I'm standing here.
I'm angry, because it's not my fault.
My team is facing a pressure test.
Had I been able to deliver the dessert I wanted to,
I don't think we would be here today.
Red team, you were the real stars last night, and you will not be facing a pressure test.
Make your way up to the gallery.
Watch and learn.
I feel amazing that I don't have to go on to the pressure test, 'cause nobody has any idea what it's gonna be, but we do know that somebody's going home, and I know that that somebody is not me.
Okay, for this pressure test, you all will have to create one of these-- a stunning, delicious, eye-capturing layered cake...
A masterpiece built on textures, taste, and visual impact.
I've been baking since about age ten, so I'm extreme comfortable baking cakes.
You'll have two hours to make a cake with a minimum of six layers of sponge.
Why six layers?
Why--why do you need to eat six layers of cake?
Okay, on to your stations, please.
And remember, whoever has the worst layered cake in this pressure test-- at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Two hours...
From now!
Off you go.
In this pressure test, the cooks will have two hours to produce a delectable six-layer cake.
The judges will be looking for perfect construction and presentation as well as amazing taste.
I'm just gonna go with a standard vanilla chiffon cake.
I'm gonna do a cream cheese frosting and maybe add a little bit of basil and strawberry flavoring to that.
I'm gonna do an ice cream sundae, basically, in a layer cake, so we're gonna do banana.
We're gonna have a little bit of hazelnut.
So that's kind of the game plan right now.
Six layers.
For a professional chef, that's a tall task, right?
Right, right.
You have to have the technicality of baking-- architecture, construction, flavor profiles.
Chemistry.
The base of the cake has to be a thick layer so it stands up when you slice that wedge.
Mm-hmm.
The layers in between don't have to be as thick as the bottom base...
Right.
Otherwise it becomes top-heavy.
It's gonna topple.
All right, Ben.
How are we doing?
Hello.
It's gonna be an awful elimination today.
Who do you think now is at risk of going home?
I don't want anybody to go home.
From personal conversations, Tracy hasn't baked a lot.
Hey, Tracy.
How are you today?
There's a lot of talk about you being, uh, a little unexperienced in making desserts
I'm actually not the top baker in this competition.
Who do you think is gonna struggle here?
Um, me.
Christine, talk to me about your cake.
I'm gonna do a raspberry, strawberry and apricot jam in the middle.
Jam?
That's nice.
Yes, preserve.
Okay, good.
But I'm gonna pipe a little icing on the outside, so it doesn't go...
Pffft.
Christine, 30 seconds with you, I need a bottle.
I have some rum.
All right, Suzy, what are you doing?
I'm doing a chocolate sponge cake and in between I'm doing a raspberry whip and then a pecan crust on the sides...
Okay.
And a ganache on top.
Super simple, no garnish, no nothing.
Yeah.
All right, Ben...
Yes, chef.
How are you feeling?
I'm feeling very good, Chef.
I'm making a cake that I've made many times.
This is a pumpkin carrot sponge.
In between the pumpkin, what are you putting in there?
I'm doing a cream cheese frosting, and I'm gonna candy some hazelnuts to coat the outside and give it kind of a nice rustic but still elegant .
Hi, Esther.
How are we doing?
Chef, how are you?
What's wrong?
You seem s- so quiet and down and defeated.
I'm a little down.
What's wrong?
I'm not defeated.
I'm just focused.
Okay, good.
You have as good a chance as anybody in this kitchen to pull it out and to win.
Okay, folks, one hour left, and one person is going home.
While the cakes are cooling, the cooks are able to prepare their icing, which will be critical to the construction and flavor of their final cake.
On the sponge cake side, everyone seemed to bake 'em, get 'em out of the oven, and are slicing them pretty good.
I got quite excited about Ben Starr's pumpkin carrot.
However, there's no aeration in the cake...
Sure.
So it's a weighted mass.
Yeah, it's like an orange doorstop.
It's about that thick, and it looks heavy as hell.
Yeah.
Esther is still whipping her frosting.
Yeah, that's not a good sign.
If you're just whipping your frosting now, by the time you pipe it on the cake, it's gonna be melted butter, you know?
Yeah.
So they really have some risk with timing now.
We're coming up to 30 minutes left.
You should now start constructing the layers.
The key is just to keep this damn cake up.
Doing just little adjustments here to make sure it's level.
Christine, how many is on there?
You're missing two layers, yeah?
Yeah, I have it right here, chef.
Okay, good.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
I just layer it up, and I'm really not paying attention to how thick the icing is and how thick the jam is.
Just over 15 minutes to go.
stupid cake.
That's it, Tracy, all the way around.
Let the palette knife do the work.
I'm liking the consistency.
I'm liking the layers.
It's--it's standing up there nicely.
Then I realize
I've made a crucial error.
No, it's not on.
I didn't put the thing underneath.
You know those little cake rounds that help you move the cake from place to place?
Yeah, I forgot it.
Put 'em next to each other, then you can slide it over.
I literally lift the cake up and put it onto this glass round.
However, the shape of it is just not the same.
Five minutes to go.
Your cakes should now be assembled and you should be putting your finishing touches on there.
I'm freaking out a little bit.
Time is running out, and I'm just trying to get the caked filled.
I'm throwing icing in there.
I'm throwing curd in there.
I'm throwing fresh fruit in there, and I've lost count of the layers.
Last minute!
Really?
My icing is melting everywhere.
Start putting those final touches.
30 seconds to go!
I'm in a mad dash to even give them a cake I can present.
This is just stupid.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
Six, five, four, three, one, and stop!
it.
Stupid Cake.
Five, four, three, two, one, and stop!
it.
stupid cake.
That has been the most difficult pressure test ever so far in the history of MasterChef.
And from here, they look amazing.
But at least one of you... will be leaving MasterChef.
Okay, Ben Starr, let's go.
All right, Ben.
Yes, Chef.
Are you okay?
I'm wonderful.
Talk to me.
I-I've been perfecting this cake for five years, and I believe this is the first time
I have had the ingredients to be able to give you something that represents me truly as a cook.
Okay.
And the ability to finally do that in this competition is overwhelming for me.
Great, okay, good.
Describe the cake.
Chef, this is a pumpkin carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and candied hazelnuts.
Here we go.
Oh, my God.
I swear to God, that looks phenomenal...
Thank you, chef.
Absolute sublime.
That is extraordinary...
Absolute magic on a fork.
I'm just letting it finish.
My mouth just had an orgasm.
Sorry.
I feel like I have finally spoken to the judges my language, and they've understood it for the first time.
This is Ben Starr.
This is what I want to do with the rest of my life.
Suzy, let's bring it up.
My cake looks amazing.
It's decadent.
It's luscious.
And I hope they love it.
Today I made a ganache and pecan-encrusd cake with chantilly cream on top.
Each layer also has just a chantilly whip with a hint of raspberry as well.
When you mentioned crusted, uh, it definitely is that.
Crusted.
This one's like-- we're gonna kinda have to do one of these numbers, like...
The chantilly--I really wish there was more of it, just some more mouthfeel to kind of balance out with the cake.
You know, when I saw you putting the ganache on top of the cake, it was, like, perfect.
And then you went, and you put this--
I don't even know what this is.
It looks like kinda mold growing up a tree on the outside.
So there was a minimalistic kind of perfection to this cake that kinda went to hell.
I mean, this is-- it's gross.
I literally just got served, like, a piece of humble pie.
And I'm realizing that there are people in this competition that could possibly be, like, way better than me.
Okay, Tracy, come on up.
I'm thinking, please, God, just let the cake stand long enough for them to cut it and put it on their plate.
I made a sweet basil and citrus-infused syrup and blended that in with a sweet cream cheese.
So, Tracy, there's two things I notice.
"A"--the asymmetrical construction of the cake, and "B" is the frown on your face.
It's good.
I think that the orange zest and basil really kind of makes it pop a little bit and gives it some brightness and flavor.
It's simple, clean, and, um, intriguing.
Thank you.
Jennifer, let's go.
What is it?
It is a play on a banana split.
So you have your strawberries on top, your nuts on the side, your banana on the inside, your chocolate on the inside.
That looks amazing.
The chocolate goes brilliantly with the sponge, and it's sweetened by the strawberries.
And it tastes delicious.
Great job.
Esther, please come forward.
It's a lemon raspberry cake.
It's filled with a lemon curd, fresh raspberries.
And then there's a sponge cake brushed with a raspberry and lemon syrup.
It's very, very sweet, almost overly so.
Something about layer cake shows the level of finesse...
Right.
In the construction, but it looks like it's been put together in a panic.
I'm struggling with the lack of balance.
It's got that sort of overpowering acidic but sweetness to it, and it doesn't really work.
I'm frustrated, because I could've done that so much better.
I ran out of time.
Okay, Christine.
It's layers of apricots, raspberries, strawberries, and a little bit of hazelnut liqueur, just layer upon layer.
It seems a little bit...
Kind of, uh...
Sweet-on-sweet, one-dimensional, no contrast, like, uh, boring.
Okay, Christine, the frosting on the outside is what?
It's buttercream.
Sponge is perfect.
The cake's lacking personality.
And it's pretty sort of run-of-the-mill.
All of you, come down, please.
I'm really disappointed in myself.
Like, this is by far the worst I've ever done, and it sucks that it was during a pressure test.
Two hour to produce a stunning six-layered delicious cake.
Sadly, at least one of you will be leaving MasterChef.
Right.
Tracy, step forward.
Jennifer, step forward.
Ben Starr, step forward...
And take you, Tracy, and Jennifer upstairs.
Congratulations.
Let's go.
Okay, Esther,
Christine, Suzy, clearly all three in the bottom half.
Suzy, it wasn't your best shot.
Christine, on the back of your performance with the beef Wellington, the cake didn't match anywhere near what you produced in the last challenge.
Esther--awkward, it didn't really work, and a bizarre texture.
Christine, step forward, please.
Oh, my God.
You've done a lot inside this competition.
And at times, you've really handled the pressure brilliantly.
The three of us are proud of you.
And I'm sure right now your dad and your son are equally as proud of you.
I'm sorry.
After the six-layer cake pressure test, it's down to the last three.
One of them will be going home.
Christine.
You've done a lot inside this competition.
And at times, you've really handled the pressure brilliantly.
Christine,
I'm sorry, take your apron...
Upstairs to the balcony.
I think I almost peed myself.
People keep underestimating me.
I'm still here to win it, so you just better watch it.
Oh, my God.
At this point,
I think I just got hit by a truck.
And I've got this feeling inside of me, that, like, this is my time.
Esther, Suzy, we've got the neural engineer versus the lawyer.
It's down to me and Suzy.
I quit my job, I'm here, and this opportunity means the world to me.
I'm not ready to go home.
Suzy, what frustrated all three of us was the fact that you had something on the verge of stunning, but the add-ons and the pecans just didn't work.
You don't know where to draw the line in the sand.
Esther, you're a very technical, intelligent cook.
But you looked out of your depth across those two hours.
Esther, step forward.
Oh, my God.
Esther...
Take your apron off.
Your time is done in MasterChef.
Promise...
I'm promising.
Stay on that journey.
I will.
I'm not gonna give up.
I'm not gonna go back to being just a lawyer.
It takes a lot of courage and conviction to quit your job, but it's absolutely worth it when you're pursuing your passion.
Food excites me.
And I feel empowered leaving MasterChef.
The world is my oyster.
Suzy, sometimes across these challenges, you go in denial.
And there's parts of you that produce sort of fake ideas that unfortunately don't really wash.
So we tell you to make you better, and you seem to ignore that advice.
Take the advice, run with it, and come back strong.
You may be walking on thin ice, but the ganache was delicious.
Take your apron upstairs and join the rest of them.
Let's go.
I never, ever, ever in my life ever want to do a pressure test again.
That was my hell.
That was honestly the worst feeling
I've ever had in my life.
That was so much disappointment in myself.
I'm never gonna be in there again.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Next time on MasterChef...
The biggest mystery box we've ever had.
One cook's aggression is unleashed.
I'm not here to make friends.
And one judge's temper boils over.
Show these people the same respect they show you.
If not, I'm gonna personally come over there and throw you out of here.
And another home cook's MasterChef dreams will come to an end.
I am speechless.
Memphis Beat;
Season 2 Episode 10 The Feud August 16, 2011
I've just never met anyone who doesn't like toast.
You can't tell me the texture's pleasing.
I mean, it rips up the top of your mouth.
No.
Maybe you've been eating your toast too aggressively.
Maybe I have.
All right, well, I'll see you.
Yeah.
I'll see you.
Maybe next time, we can talk about...
Biscuits.
Morning, Dwight.
Well, hello, Reggie.
Uh... she got a name?
Yep.
Whitehead.
Yeah, I'm outside.
All right, meet at the car.
See you later.
Yep.
Hey, can we talk to her?
She's unconscious.
She gonna make it?
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
We've got her stabilized, but that's all I know.
You'll have to talk to the doctors at the hospital.
Hey, Sutton!
What do we got?
Good Samaritan heard a gunshot, called 911.
Couldn't have been more than 20 minutes ago.
Good Samaritan see anything?
I don't know.
He hung up without providing any more additional information.
Her wallet's missing.
She was wearing an expensive watch and earrings.
If robbery was the motive, something kept him from maximizing his haul.
Fairburn Financial.
1327 Broadway.
That's only a couple blocks away from here.
She was dressed real nice.
That could be where she works.
Whitehead.

Ella is an intern.
She's getting her MBA.
Would Ella have worked on anything that put her in harm's way?
Oh, I-I doubt it.
We're a forensic accounting firm.
Just numbers and analysis...
no money or secret information.
Did Ella get along with everyone?
Oh, she was super.
She... she was only here a couple of weeks when one of the assistants had an emergency appendectomy.
Ella offered to stay with her son.
Any troubles outside the office?
I don't know.
She didn't like to talk about herself.
"Didn't like to" is different than "didn't."
I just assumed she was a very private person.
Anyone ever come visit her?
She had a boyfriend.
He never came by, but he sent flowers.
He have a name?
I asked once.
She never did give me an answer.
Um, this is her job application.
I can make you a copy.
I'll be right back.
I've started a background check on Ella Harris, but right now, it looks like she has no background information older than five years.
- She changed her name?
- Looks like it.
Why would a girl her age need to change her name?
Well, I hope to find out.
Whitehead.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there.
You think you worked fast before, you better step it up a notch.
Armed guard just showed up at the hospital to protect our victim.
Why does a girl her age need armed guards?
Hope to find out.
Detective Hendricks.
This is Detective White.
We'd like to know what the hell you're doing.
I'm sure Judge Morris will be happy to explain things.
I'd like you to explain it, Mr...?
Layendecker.
You, uh, call Judge Morris.
What's your relationship with Ella Harris?
She's a client.
Who are these gorillas protecting her from?
Well, someone shot her, and I'd like that not to happen again.
Maybe we could go down to the station and we could talk about this a little bit more.
Are you arresting me?
No.
Well, then we both know I don't have to do that.
Lawyer.
The lawyer from the hospital works downtown at Barr Jenkins.
I checked with the bar association.
They only have one client...
the Murphy family.
"Bars, alcohol distribution, and various criminal activity"
Murphy family?
That's the one.
What does Ella Harris have to do with the Murphy family?
That's a rhetorical question, right?
I'm not actually supposed to know the answer?
It'd save me a hell of a lot of time if you did, but no.
Call Dwight and Charlie White and bring them up to speed.
Will do.
Greenback's saying Fairburn Financial isn't involved with any Murphy businesses.
So Ella doesn't work for them.
What if she dug around in something she wasn't supposed to?
Maybe those guards aren't there to protect her.
Maybe they're there to keep people away from her so she can't say anything to anybody.
Two pit bulls in the front.
That's got to be Mrs. Murphy.
MPD, gentlemen.
Keep your distance.
Ma'am, we need to talk to you about Ella Harris.
I've got nothing to say.
We have enough probable cause to start making trouble for your whole organization.
It'd be easier if you just talk to us.
And say what?
Nothing happens in your world that you're not aware of.
Why don't you just tell us what's going on?
You're wasting my time.
Look, as much as 150 years of Memphis history might make you think otherwise, the Murphy clan is not above the law.
The law?
What good is the law to me?
Ella gets gunned down in broad daylight, and you don't even know who did it!
No, but we might be able to figure it out if you help us.
You want my help, you talk to my lawyer.
She changed her last name so that she could move around Memphis without the family baggage.
Ella's your daughter.
Yes, she is.
You know, you better hope you find whoever shot her first.
'Cause in case you haven't heard,
I am not so good at turning the other cheek.
Did you ask her if the shooting was related to the feud between her family and the Harrison clan?
No.
So what do you think?
Well, the truce between the clans has been in effect for 25 years.
I think we would have heard some rumblings before the shooting broke out.
Yeah, but feuds are funny.
They start fast.
Could be they restart just as fast.
We need to figure this out before they start killing each other in bunches.
Me and Whitehead will look into the family, see what we can find.
Good.
I'll be back in about an hour.
Where you going?
To see a friend.
Her name is Kaylee Slater.
I've been trying to get him to tell me about her for days, and I got nothing.
- And he told you?
- Yeah.
Well, what the hell?
I'm just messing with you.
Greenback was out front this morning when she dropped him off.
He got her license plate.
Well, if she dropped him off, things must be moving along.
I think we should invite her.
He might not like that.
He's not gonna like anything about a birthday party.
That's half the fun in doing it.
Hey, I found the flower shop where the boyfriend was buying the flowers.
Did you get a name?
Not unless it's "xoxo."
The owner couldn't give me a good description.
See, she mostly remembers his money.
He gave her 1,000 bucks up front and would call anytime he wanted to send something.
Did you get copies of the notes?
The owner wrote the messages down in her phone log.
He sent flowers three days before the shooting.
"I lost my cool.
Please forgive me.
Hugs and kisses."
Secretive girl meets abusive boy.
A love story.
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
We don't have any jobs available right now.
I'm looking for my cousin Fred.
I'm surprising him.
Uh, I don't know if he's around.
Would you mind calling him for me, please?
Tell him it's Tanya and I'm just in town for a few days.
His mama wanted me to give him a kiss for her.
Thank you.
I'll be waiting in my car, just 'round the corner.
Ohh, cousin Fred!
Look at you!
Look at you!
You are the picture of health.
And, cousin Tanya, you know you are not supposed to be here!
I know!
And that security guard was so nice to tell you that I was here.
Your mama sent you some pecan sandies, and you better get in this car before I eat them all up.
Oh, yeah!
This must be really important for you to break protocol...
And maybe ruin my cover.
I am not gonna ruin your cover.
And protocol takes too long.
Did you hear about the shooting?
- Mm-hmm.
- So, what do you think?
Is it just regular violence in a criminal family, or is it feud-related?
As far as I know, the truce is still in effect.
But Ella is heir apparent, and I've seen her down at the warehouse a couple of times caused quite a stir.
Apparently, the top dogs have not been around in years.
So what was she doing?
I'm unloading trucks, but I did hear her talk about risk and... expanding into new territories.
Harrison territories?
I don't know.
But if it was, that would blow that truce all to hell.
Well, yeah.
Which means it might have been a Harrison that was targeting her.
Or any Murphy that didn't want her stirring up trouble.
Hey.
You can enjoy those.
Will you call me if you hear or see anything?
Will do.
You know all this is in my monthly report.
Reports are so dry.
- Something wrong, officer?
- Wrong?
You giving me a ticket?
Ticket?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Yes, I was.
Can you tell me what for?
Oh, uh...
Your taillight.
There's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, yeah.
I knew that.
Um...
You got one of those kind of taillights that, uh...
they can break real easy, so I was just writing you a note to, uh...
let you know that you should maybe change that.
And...
Well, n-now I told you.
Uh, good evening, ma'am!
It's, um... day.
But...
Take care.
Damn.
Bye.
C. J. Harrison.
He runs a strip club off the highway.
It's interesting how they stuck to their knitting all these years.
We got alcohol and real estate and sex and guns.
I guess it pays to specialize, even if you're a criminal.
Records department is sending over hard copies of all their files.
It could be the old arrest reports will give us a sense of who hates who the most.
You think any of these people have any idea what started this feud?
You?
I think it's like a...
Cow or something.
That was the Chicago fire, buddy.
No, Lewis Murphy bought a piece of land in 1870.
Built the house, went to Kentucky to pick up his wife and kids.
While he was gone,
Rufus Harrison moved in and refused to move out.
So, Lewis shot Rufus, Rufus' kin shot Lewis, et cetera.
What about the 25-year truce?
I don't know anyone who knows why the shooting stopped.
Maybe they ran out of bullets.
Hey.
I've been reconstructing Ella's movements for the last couple of days.
Now, the night before she got those apology flowers from "hugs and kisses,"
she went to a bar on the east side, where police were called to break up a fight.
Anyone arrested?
All the participants scattered before the units got there.
But here... here's the address.
Well, if she took on that fake name to hide, she still managed to get herself into a lot of trouble.
Let's go, Whitehead.
Yeah, I know Ella.
She and her boyfriend come in all the time.
You know his name?
I tend to remember the women's names.
He's tall, dark hair.
Seems like a solid guy.
But, obviously, after the other night,
I probably wouldn't cross him.
He involved in the fight?
He was at the center of it.
Some guys went up to their table.
Next thing you know, chairs are flying.
How does Ella fit into it?
I don't know.
She pulled him out of here as soon as we separated them.
Could be the other guys were Harrisons.
Boyfriend didn't know enough to let it be.
Can you take a look at these and see if you recognize any of these fellas?
That's him.
You're sure this guy was in the group that went up to Ella's table that night?
No, that guy's her boyfriend.
Pete Harrison, Tom's son...
Second in command?
Ella's dating the enemy.
What do you guys want?
We're just trying to figure out if Ella knew you were a part of the Harrison clan.
I'm thinking that she didn't.
Yeah, their whole dating thing was probably a setup so he could get information about the Murphy businesses.
And that night, she found out who he was.
You don't know what you're talking about.
It was a great way to show your dad you're ready to take over the family.
But then, after you'd invested all those months... poof!
What'd you think, that it was just gonna be easier to kill her to take down the Murphys?
I would never hurt Ella.
Then what the hell was the fight about in the bar?
Some guys were hitting on her.
I lost my cool.
No big deal.
Oh, so you're the jealous boyfriend?
Yeah.
Your families have been fighting for 150 years, man.
You expect us to believe that you cared about Ella Murphy?
I'd like a lawyer.
I'm losing my patience.
I want my son released immediately.
And I have a job to do.
So your lack of patience is not my concern.
Hey.
You don't talk to my Uncle like that, you hear?
You're Dean, right?
Yeah.
Mr. Harrison, I suggest you have Dean, here, back off and sit down, or I'll have his ass cooling off in a holding cell.
Dean, don't embarrass me.
So...
Now, Pete will be released when we determine that he had nothing to do with the shooting of Ella Murphy.
We have no quibble with the Murphys...
Haven't for a quarter of a century.
None of my clan would do anything to hurt Ella.
Well, then, I suppose Pete will be released soon.
Until then, I'll have you two waiting in the lobby.
What's he doing here?
Mrs. Murphy, please come this way.
No, I want to know what Tom Harrison's doing here.
Obviously, we're exploring every possibility.
I could've crushed your family, but I left you alone for 25 years.
And you pay me back by shooting Ella?
Kate, do you think that I would...
Unh!
All right, that's enough!
Son of a...
Let go of me!
Mr. Harrison, unless you're planning to press charges,
I need to ask you to leave the building.
Saunders, see him out.
Good one.
Your text said you got something for me.
A Murphy semi was hijacked this morning, and the driver was beat pretty badly.
So you know who did it?
No.
But this family hasn't had a truck jacked in a long, long time.
But you think it's related to the shooting?
Maybe the truce is over.
You know, figuring this stuff out is your job.
You could have told me about the truck in your text.
Yeah, I could have.
But texting is so overrated.
So, why don't you tell me what happened to you and your truck?
I'm not gonna get in any trouble, am I?
You gonna go out of your way to piss me off?
- No!
- Then no.
Well, I was delivering a truckload full of totally legit alcohol to a warehouse down by the river.
And at Granville, I had to stop at the intersection 'cause it was blocked.
And before I could turn the truck around, these guys, they pulled me out of the cab.
Well, your face looks like it got more than pulled from a truck.
Look, I didn't give them any trouble whatsoever, and for no reason at all, they started wailing on me.
I'd be dead if their buddy hadn't pulled up and stopped them.
You got a name?
No.
But he was pissed that they were on me.
Will you look at some pictures for me, see if you can I.D. any of them?
Hey, these guys tried to kill you.
I'm not gonna arrest them for that, 'cause I know you won't testify.
But wouldn't it be nice if I could pick them up on something else?
Yeah.
Yeah.
According to the driver, these are two of the guys involved.
Now, they're both Harrisons.
And this is the man who saved him.
Hijacking happened at 7:00?
Yep.
The 911 call about the shooting came in at 7:15.
No way he could have gotten clear across town by then.
I guess I should be happy that he wasn't lying about shooting her.
This means that whoever did it is still out there.
W-what are you...
Doing here?
I didn't mean it...
for it to sound like that.
You left your wallet on my seat.
I knew that.
Did you send that man to my house?
Sutton?
I don't know his name.
The... the skinny one.
No.
Are you checking up on me?
No, why... why would I...
I don't know.
I'm gonna go.
Wait, K-Kaylee, I-I don't know what's going on here, but...
Hendricks.
No, of course.
All righty.
Thank you.
Ella woke up.
So what do you want to do?
Kate Murphy's already told us her daughter's not gonna talk to us until she gets out of the hospital.
Yeah, she won't tell us anything.
Family business stays in the family.
She might tell Pete though.
Look, we have no grounds to hold you, so I got no leverage here.
But if you really love Ella, you'll help us find out who shot her.
I see how that's good for you.
Not so sure how it's good...
Shooter!
You all right?
Yeah.
Now you understand why this is good for you?
It says here "Barbecue is the new Sushi."
Do you think that's even possible?
Mom, not now.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm just trying to cheer you up.
Actually, after what you told me before,
I'm just trying to cheer myself up.
Hey.
I already talked to the district attorney, and I told him that Ella is not to talk to the police until she's released from the hospital.
You got it?
Yeah.
That's fine.
Uh, I just came by to tell you that MPD ran the concealed-gun permits of the guys you got protecting her.
Now, two of them came back red-flagged.
In about 10 minutes, units are gonna come out here and arrest those two guys, and MPD's gonna use that as an excuse to pick you up, too.
Who are you?
I'm Davey Sutton, ma'am.
I'm one of your...
Guys on the inside.
You pay me $1,000 a month.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, David.
Honey, I'm just gonna have to go and take care of...
That matter.
Davey, what are you still doing here?
I-I thought you might need an escort or something.
You know, I got the lights.
Uh, no, thank you.
Okay.
Feel better.
I'll have a couple of guys sent over from the house.
It's gonna take an hour, tops.
I'll be fine.
Now, listen, if anything happens, you call that nurse...
they will call security.
Dr. Barnes, dial 182, please.
Whoever's behind this, we got to catch them before someone else gets hurt.
Okay.
Whatever she can give you, all right?
Name, description, what they were wearing.
Pete, you can't be here.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
But she's gonna be back any minute.
You got to go.
I got somebody watching your mother.
I'll make sure to give you the heads-up when she's coming back.
I'm so happy to see you.
All right, I'll...
I'll go, just leave you two.
Miss Slater.
Charlie white...
Dwight's partner.
Yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.
A small percentage of it's probably true.
Hey, I want to talk to you about Sutton.
Oh, I don't really like to triangulate my relationships,
Detective White.
Well, I get that, but this is not triangulating.
Dwight had no idea what Sutton was doing here, and he has no idea that I'm here.
What was Sutton doing?
Inviting you to Dwight's birthday party.
He was supposed to just leave a note.
You know, in retrospect, he might not have been our best emissary.
Shouldn't Dwight be the one to invite me to his party?
He really doesn't like birthdays, and this one's a surprise.
Well, we really haven't been dating that long, so...
I know, but he's been hiding you.
Which leads me to believe that you mean something to him.
And I'm confident that, you know, he'll like having you there...
As much as he can like having anythig on his birthday.
When is it?
It's tomorrow night... 8:00.
Here's the address.
Thanks, Charlie.
Thank you, Kaylee.
Pete left five minutes ago.
I guess I was right about him not cooperating.
Hey, Sutton, listen, I wanted to...
I got to get back inside.
Nurse wants to tell me something.
Pete, please leave.
I'm not kidding about my mom.
She's so angry about everything that's going on.
Who shot you, Ella?
I don't know.
I was walking to work.
A man said my name.
I didn't see him.
I just saw a shiny gun, and then...
What happened?
Nurse thinks it's a false alarm.
They didn't have any patients evacuate?
Nope.
Ella left on her own.
Or someone took her.
I don't know what to tell you.
Call Mike Thompson and ask him, and I'll meet you guys around back.
They searched the hospital top to bottom.
No sign of her.
What did the doctors say?
She's in no immediate danger, as long as she doesn't move around too much.
What about Pete Harrison?
M.I.A.
Hopefully, he's got her and actually is concerned about her well-being.
Better than the alternative, which is she was nabbed by the guy that shot her and tried to shot him.
Two shootings, 24 hours.
Sounds like a feud in full force to me.
Yeah.
Or the worse party you've ever been invited to.
Sutton's bringing down the hospital security video.
We'll get on it as soon as possible.
Hey, Dwight.
If she knows her daughter's missing, she's not worried about it.
She just walked into the building where that lawyer has his office.
You want me to get a little closer so I can hear what they're talking about, or should I...
Call you back.
Nobody double-crosses me.
Put it down!
Right now!
Put it down, get your hands up!
Hands up!
What is wrong with you people?
You're a lucky man.
She's missing.
What are you talking about?
Ella is gone from the hospital.
Well, you have to let me out of here!
No, we don't.
Well, look, if somebody has her, you have to let me go and find him!
All right.
Tell us why you attacked your lawyer.
That is between me and him.
Awfully coincidental, isn't it, you having a problem with him right after your daughter gets attacked?
Now, look, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Tell us what's going on.
I want to speak to my attorney.
I'm sure you do.
Maybe we should just throw them all in a room and let them kill each other.
That'd save on overhead.
Now that we got a few more pieces of the puzzle, maybe your friend can help.
I'm guessing he's an undercover cop, 'cause you don't have too many friends who aren't cops or cop-adjacent.
Plus, you keep leaving and coming back with information.
I already went once without an invite.
I can't go again and risk blowing his cover.
No problem.
You know, you got no grounds for this.
You and your buddies are in major violation of the tariff act.
Expect some significant fines and community service, old pal.
Get your ass in there.
Hey.
Really?
It was one of my detectives' ideas.
Now, it is a bit over the top, but we needed to talk to you.
This is Detective White.
Hey, nice to meet you.
What's going on?
Ella Murphy and Pete Harrison are dating.
Somebody tried to shoot Pete, Ella's missing, and Kate Murphy attacked her lawyer.
Over what?
Some kind of double-cross.
You know, you remember I heard Ella talking about expanding their business?
Now, I assumed she was talking about taking over some of Harrison turf.
Yeah?
Murphy started deducting payroll tax from our checks two months ago.
Maybe they're going legit.
Expanding that part of the business, trying to get out the rest.
That'd leave a heap of illegal activity left over for somebody to take over.
The double-crossing lawyer doesn't seem the type that would shoot somebody.
Then he must have a partner.
Okay, detective, let's go and book Fred, get back on this.
Remind me to check on Rice's friend in about an hour and make sure he gets bailed out.
I got a uniform covering the lawyer.
We'll get a call as soon as the doctor's finished with him.
If this guy's absorbing all the Murphys' illegal businesses, it just doesn't make any sense for him to restart this feud.
Unless his partner's hell-bent on monopolizing all the crime in Memphis.
Or crazy.
There's that.
I got her.
Sutton, freeze it.
That's Dean Harrison...
that's Pete's cousin.
That's a gun.
I already told the lieutenant
I had nothing to do with Ella's shooting.
What the hell is going on?
Detective Hendricks and I have something we want to tell you two, and we only wanted to have to say it once.
Dean Harrison kidnapped Pete and Ella.
Oh, my God.
Look at this.
I don't why Dean would do something like this.
We believe Dean is trying to take over the illegal activities the Murphys are abandoning, and your lawyer is working with him.
And he thinks Ella and Pete are a threat to his empire.
Well, why would he think that?
Because they say that they are in love.
If what we've heard about Dean is true, your kids are probably dead, and you can keep quiet.
But if there's any hope that it's not too late, you need to help us find them.
Tom...
Did you have anything to do with this?
Kate...
You know I could never do anything like this to you.
You know that.
I'm...
I'm sensing...
something here.
Are the two of you in...?
Ah, you got to be kidding me.
No, look at them.
Think they've gone soft and... dewy?
He says he didn't do it, and she believes him.
It was a long time ago.
It just didn't work out.
We couldn't, um...
I couldn't.
Tom couldn't tell his family about us.
Kate got so angry with me that she couldn't bother fighting anymore.
That's why there's a truce.
Okay, then, we've worked through the "feelings" part of this conversation, but we still need to get to the "solution" part.
You got to help us find your kids.
Do you think he actually knows where they are?
He's certainly motivated to find out.
You know, given the state of things,
I think we might need to cancel drinks tomorrow.
No can do, buckaroo.
We're on a case, Whitehead.
Yeah, but you still need downtime.
I know about the party.
Then you know what a jackass you'll be if you don't show up.
I called everybody I know.
If they're not here, then I don't know where they are.
I put my number on there, too, so I'd appreciate it if you'd give me a call if you find something.
I will.
I'll pass it along to Kate.
Thank you, detectives.
There's money to be had!
You can't just walk away!
I told you...
Ella and I are taking everything in a new direction.
I ain't gonna let you restart the feud.
Now, get out of my way!
And I'm not gonna let you choose her over the family!
You shot someone I love!
You tried to shot me!
What kind of family are you?
!
What the hell is wrong with you?
!
You've gone soft!
I should have never told you about her.
But I thought you'd be happy for me.
Now, I don't care what you think.
I love Ella, and I'm not gonna let her die.
Now, I'm taking her to the hospital.
If you want to shoot me in the back, well, that's on you, man.
Hey!
Consider that your wedding present.
You okay?
Yeah.
Have you met her?
I have not.
Is she cute?
Well, how would I know?
She's cute.
Oh, how cute?
Verycute.
I just don't know why she's not here.
I gave her...
That would be why.
Oh, and, by the way, he knows about the party.
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!
Hey, mama.
Hey, Dwight.
She's real.
She's real... nice for being here tonight.
Well, I'm happy to have been invited.
Thank you.
You all know how much I dislike public celebrations of my birthday.
I appreciate that you cared enough to ignore me.
And I thank you in advance for my present.
Ringleaders, up onstage.
Oh, come on!
Excuse me.
No way!
Let's go!
Dwight, you know I can't sing.
Well, you can be in charge of the dancing.
All right, here we go!

- Uh, six letters. "Spray with water.
- "Bar."
"Douche." [ Scoffs ] Nice.
What?
That's a legitimate answer to the question.
Four letters. "Desire to push."
"Urge." "Fart."
Honey, that doesn't even make sense.
Yes, it does.
"To negotiate." Also four letters.
"Deal." "Dick."
- Sorry. "Dicker.
- You're such an idiot.
Why?
That's...
I'm trying to teach you something.
It's like playing mad libs with a 7-year-old.
Listen.
Listen and learn.
Hey.
Hey.
You're back from your trip.
Actually, I didn't go.
It was bad timing.
You should know that I'm taking Camille to school this weekend.
Ah.
Well, if, uh, she needs any help, have her call me.
I will.
It was really great seeing you guys.
And you.
You too.
Is she coming back?
It's possible.
That keeps happening.
I walk up, people walk away.
Hello.
This is Brenda Marshall.
Are you serious?
I'm getting a complex.
Oh.
"Oval."
We need some help here.
It's Tony, Steve.
Okay.
Uh, head for trauma 4.
Obvious abdominal trauma.
B.P.'S 115 over 60.
Lacerations and abrasions and a possible tib-fib fracture.
Bring it around this way.
Watch your back.
On three.
One, two, three.
##
# A good idea till your will is due #
# Is go out to that place on the Tortous Bayou #
- # Well, maybe get lucky Maybe get shot #
# It couldn't be half the trouble I got #
# Tortous Bayou Turn around #
How do we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact G.P.S. coordinates.
Everglades makes it F.B.I. jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
That is right.
Male.
Late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kinda figured that out with the glass eye there.
So where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you wanna get rid of a body... you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal... fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals?
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
- Feral hogs?
- Mm-hmm.
Sure.
Ah.
The serial number... for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
Great.
That's all I need.
Just give me the serial number.
I'll just text it back to the Miami field office... and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
- Isn't that right, Sheriff?
- You bet.
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye.
Yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
- Well-
- Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik- he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
- Was it some kind of an accident?
- Body dump.
Murder?
- Who would murder Sam?
- Traditionally that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues- you know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work 10 days ago.
Seventy-two hours later, we reported him missing.
That's the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
Something sneaky.
That's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th-century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
- What's it worth?
- Well, that depends who you talk to.
Well, we're talking to you.
It's worthless until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place... of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
Treasure ship?
So when you say "worthless," what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes.
I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years... and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Well, it looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick...
- to find water in the desert?
- Diviners?
Yeah, I know one.
I know a man who can do third-degree polynomial equations in his head.
No.
Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you here.
What I'm saying to you is...
I actually know somebody I can put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water.
Maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
This son of a bitch has got the "finder power."
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a "her" or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
- Walter?
- You mind?
We got an important philiosophical debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"... which also does not apply to "ninja versus samurai."
- Samurai.
- No, you know what?
He's right.
I definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet, straight up- right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
- Who are you?
- Leo, Walter's legal adviser.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
Are you still on retainer with the F.B. I?
If you were legitimate F.B.I., you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm gonna have to see some credentials.
- Okay.
- Oh.
See that?
F.B.I. No.
- How about you?
- Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No-
- Why not?
Just give
- That's gonna be bad.
Too late now.
- He's very suspicious.
- Why did you give him that?
You're not sup-
You shouldn't just-
Now he's biting my I.D. He's gonna ruin the magnetic strip!
- Give me the I.D., Wally.
Wally, give me the I.D.
- I'm not done with it.
Give me the I.D., Wal-
Give it back!
Give back the I.D., Wally!
Stop it!
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
Little help?
Leo, where you going?
- Cold beer while you wait?
- Give me back the I.D.!
Wait for what?
- Not
- Not
- Ow!
- Get out-
For the boys to get reacquainted.
I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
Wouldn't do you any good.
A while back, I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh- should we say a guardian angel on his shoulder.
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the "what was once lost and now is found."
Hey, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever it is to the light.
- Whatever it is is a map.
- It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please.
Call me Walter.
Seriously?
Focus, can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
- No.
- No.
Would you sleep with me?
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
It's a treasure map.
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in, or are you out?
You're supposed to find that Chinese satellite... what crashed to earth in East Texas.
- That doesn't sound real.
- Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in for my old compadre.
But I am the finder.
You're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment... but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
Why?
N-No.
Who-Who told you to get my cell phone number?
Uh-oh.
Just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Bones has her thing... just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary "finder power."
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost, and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones
- Okay.
Tell him-
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade, I won... first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to-
Yeah.
That's all I need.
Do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D. C?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial, so why don't you go back inside... and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Here we go.
Fly commercial.
They know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet.
One bedroom, one bath.
Crap neighborhood.
600 bucks a month max.
Pudge pulled down 375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
- You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
- Total novice.
Tell you what.
Somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm-a risk it.
You wanna come with?
I'm your legal adviser, not your accomplice.
I miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from... we call Walter's gift Darna Shealladh- the second sight.
Yeah, right.
'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you... the day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter... to make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
"Then thy shall walk in thy way safely."
Do you know what you are?
You're an enablizer.

Who is this?
It's me.
You've been in there long enough.
Okay, story so far-
Clinically depressed.
No girlfriend.
Weight issues.
Mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime, except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video the guy's drunk, but this house is dryer than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes Pudge to steal the map.
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books... imagines himself a hard-boiled crook... shows up at the meet all whiskeyed up for courage... without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yeah.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map... most likely after torture.
Otherwise, the place would be upside down and inside out.
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller I. D?
Caller I.D. doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition... that the victim died with his secret intact.
Nope.
He told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety-deposit box.
I don't know what that means.
Pawn shop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Uhh.
Me too.
For each person who goes in, three come out... and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
Ja, mein Name ist Walter Sherman.
Oh.
Hello.
"Ist"du Frau Becken- who was Temperance Brennan's-
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
Here in America, you're considering false redemption of a pawn ticket.
- Theft.
Identity theft.
- Yeah.
I'm-a risk it.
"Dast" in seventh-grade science fair medal denn?
lmpersonation with attempt to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm-a risk it.
##
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled "ukulele" wrong.
Too many E's and L's, unless-
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik- which is exactly whom you are not.
We could get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although...
I'm always up for handcuffs.
- You know what?
Come here.
- Wh-
Recently you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing?
Health?
Vermin?
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Aw, that's a shame right there.
What happened to it?
- Girl smashed it to bits.
- A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
The girlfriend who smashed it- what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right.
Well, what local cops like to do these days... is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name... but she had a tattoo across her chest-
"Do Not Resuscitate."
- ## - ##
Walter, I told you, when you found me a set... of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the jomon period... anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl, "Do Not Resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest?
Daddy issues, self-loathing.
Possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
##
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do Not Resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
- No, man.
- I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution... in all of southern Florida or just this county?
Leo!
Leo.
As a peaceful man, I'm gonna ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what?
You're gonna recite me a poem?
"Peace goes into the making of a poet... as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal adviser.
- ## - # Yeah #
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables... and they're running whores.
I didn't bring you here for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
# Yeah #
##
Well, well.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
Brittany Stephenson.
It looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So I asked you why'd you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's a lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Ah, something suggestive, like a- ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not a lesbian.
I just have a confident demeanior.
All right?
Oh-
Oi, oi.
Have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the old lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay.
How's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm-a risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle.
Maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
##
# I'm gonna play I'm gonna play today, yeah #
# I'm gonna play I'm gonna play #
# Yeah ##
Hey, you live on a boat?
You're like herpes- impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Okay, so a tattoo, "Do Not Resuscitate." A boat, Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea the black market on organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation... to wake up in a bathtub packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs.
You look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems.
Am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious... but otherwise, I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
The tide's shifting now, so-
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope?
It belongs to a client.
Well, I gotta shove off, so... sayonara.
Which is Chinese for "get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute.
But if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm, like, a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss.
All right?
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you now?
Just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
- How about you?
- Nothing in her truck.
- Not even a VIN number.
- Ah.
Chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away- that's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how many blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
Brittany's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
Dr. Brennan?
Mr. Sherman-
- What's this?
- As promised.
Aw.
You did it.
That's
- Uh-
I was going to say impossible... but clearly it's not impossible, but-
I-I
- I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
This-
This is me and- my mom.
I... am extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but... the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab that can recreate... the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes.
Yes.
I, um-
Angela Montenegro has been working on that.
I will take you to her- to her office.
It's, um-
The security footage includes several dozen frames... from slightly different angles, so we should be able to get a pretty good image.
- How accurate will this be?
- 100 percent.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to 10, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich, it just explains the discrepancy.
Really?
Boys?
The navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though... this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
"Seguid vuestro jefe."
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ... and his representative on earth, the pope...
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome... not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
You're pretty confident of your arithmetic!
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
- Leo did it in his head.
- It's correct!
Then we are here.
- Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
- For Brittany?
I'm more concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip?
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks, which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah, I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
Nah.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe 10 miles east.
You might want to rethink your math.
You see anything?
Yeah.
What'd you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
Not amberjacks.
Brittany.
Brittany Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess, since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
- Me.
- No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding... pathognomonic of drowning.
- Oh.
- "Oh," what?
You find something?
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry and blames Brittany... realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
- Wait a second.
Is that blood?
- Yeah.
- I don't think it's all hers.
- Enough for D.N. A?
If our killer's in the database.
Wow!
More than enough.
She bit the attacker's finger off.
- Unfortunately-
- Wow.
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Don't touch that, Wally!
That's evidence.
- Please.
Come on.
- This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses- mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
- Yeah.
Two murders.
- Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka.
Ta-da.
Bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it.
In her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter... her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously?
Before I tell you what I know...
I want you to promise me the church will get the treasure.
You got a deal, Eddie.
Please.
Address me as "Excellency." I'm a bishop.
Bishop schmishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I'd lost it.
Now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
Where exactly do the three nails appear?
- Here.
- "Seguid vuestro jefe."
"Follow your leader."
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give Communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret.
So he used a special ink which would only appear... when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You're a Jesuit.
Uh
- Excellency.
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza... the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England.
A Catholic from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory... on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me.
I hate that.
You know, you really should have broached the subject of his mental health... before you told him what he needed to know.
##
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask you what I ordered.
I asked you what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey, why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
It goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
- It's human psychology.
- It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
When friends conspire to help someone they love... it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back?
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals like Walter... hear Akashwani, or a voice from the sky.
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage... you lose your finding mojo.
That's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web... that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp... because we are just mollusks- shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean... trying to make sense of stars that we cannot even see.
I challenge everything because when I do... a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements... that otherwise appeared unconnected.
You call it paranoia.
I call it epiphany.
If you want me to give that up so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee-
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world... for I would ride with you upon the wind!"
What?
What does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
My mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
- I'm gonna bring you a new pot.
- Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
Booth, Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
- What?
- There are three nails on the chart.
- Here.
See?
Clear as day.
- So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk.
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll go back to the boring stuff.
If you want, we can figure out where to find that treasure.
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees.
No question, no debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians... all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza... didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
No.
Because if he had... the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied...
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
But at the bottom of the ocean... you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
I don't know how he could have.
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes.
It's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
The Santa Esperanza went down right here.
Those are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
It's a genuine 17th-century...
Madonna Della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh.
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand in and of itself... does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
- Where else could that have come from but this place?
- Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Oh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not police.
So what do you want?
- What do I want?
- Yeah.
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy... but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
- Ah, I'm-a risk it.
- Walter.
I'll be grievously offended... if you kill him with our Blessed Mother.
Ah, I'd never risk that, Leo.
Maybe I could just arrest him for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure stealing?
He was working for the F.B.I., right?
When he found that treasure.
He can't just keep it.
- Why do you dislike Walter so much?
- Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son, right?
- Right.
- So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military police sends Walter after me to find me.
I'm standing there holding my newborn son... and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
- Well, it was his job.
- His job?
Sometimes, you know, in this line of work... as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback.
That's all.
Oh.
Hey!
G-man, skeleton babe... we've been looking all over town for you.
- Okay.
- Is this the treasure?
- Yeah, it better be.
- Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not, I'm gonna arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
- Arrest him on what charge?
- Booth says... that Walter found the treasure while under contract to the F.B.I., so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking and acting upon my advice...
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau... at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
- That's true.
- What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
That's not
- No.
He reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What?
The Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
Booth, this isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
- Oi, oi.
Leo, off we go then.
- All right.
Oh, oh, oh!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No, you're not, 'cause if you do...
I'll add fleeing the scene to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
Lambert Chaisson.
Hey, buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You wanna try it on?
"Drowned kitten... versus fat girl smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
Are we discussing which is sadder, or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste... whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
Optimitist... versus fool.
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual... who's noticed that the only thing Walter can't find... is lasting love.
Until now.
But the bones lady- she could be the one.
Here you go.
I told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not, but it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training... with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way... the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see at best... only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway.
But more importantly...
Walter waited until after you had a chance... to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you
- There you go.
And you can't make me.
- Cheers to that.
- Fair enough.
All right?
Got your medal back.
Just remember, all right-
What's that mean?

How did we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
BOOTH:
That is right.
BRENNAN:
Male, late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
So, where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
SHERIFF:
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals.
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
BOOTH:
Feral hogs?
Mm-hmm.
Sure.
The serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
BOOTH:
Great that's all I need.
Just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?
You bet.
MAN:
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye, yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
Well...
Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik-- he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
Was this some kind of an accident?
Body dump.
Murder?
- Who would murder Sam?
- Traditionally, that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues?
You know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
This is the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
BOOTH:
Something sneaky, that's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
What's it worth?
Well, that depends who you talk to.
We're talking to you.
It's worthless, until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
- Treasure ship?
- So when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes, I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
- Diviners?
- I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
No, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
What I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody
I could put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water, maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
That son of a bitch has got the finder power.
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
- Walter?
- You mind?
We got an important
"philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"
which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai."
WALTER:
Samurai.
BOOTH:
You know what?
He's right.
I'd definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet?
Straight up, right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
Who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
You still on retainer with the FBI?
Well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
Okay.
Oh.
You see that?
FBI.
No.
- How about you?
- Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No.
- Why not?
Just give...
That's going to be bad.
Too late now.
He's very suspicious.
Why'd you give him that?
You shouldn't just...
Now he's biting my ID.
He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
All right.
Give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID.
I'm not done with it yet.
Give me the ID.
(both grunting) Give me back...
Give me back the ID.
(crashing, Walter grunts)
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
A little help.
(crashing)
Leo, where you going?
Cold beer while you wait?
Give back the ID.
Wait for what?
(both grunting)
Booth, knock it off.
For the boys to get reacquainted.

You know, I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
WALTER:
It wouldn't do you any good.
A while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh-- shall we say a guardian angel (ringing) on his shoulder?
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
Uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
"Whatever it is" is a map.
It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
BOOTH:
Seriously?
Focus.
Can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
(laughing):
No.
No.
Would you sleep with me?
BOOTH:
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
(mouths)
WALTER:
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
BOOTH:
It's a treasure map, okay?
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in or are you out?
You know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
That doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
But I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
What?
No.
Who told you to get my cell phone number?
BOOTH:
Oh, just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
BRENNAN:
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones...
Okay.
Tell him...
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade,
I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to...
That's all I need.
Um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D.C.?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial.
So why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Gotta go.
Fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
Pudge pulled down $375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
LEO:
You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
Total novice.
Tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
You want to come with?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
Miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right. 'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you?
The day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
To make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
Then thy shall walk in thy way safely.

(cell phone ringing)
Who is this?
It's me.
You been in there long enough.
WALTER:
Okay, story so far:
clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime.
Except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes
Pudge to steal the map,
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
Otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
(phone chimes)
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller ID?
Caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
No, he told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
Pawnshop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Well, me, too.
(toilet flushes)
(flushing)
For each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
(with German accent):
My name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
Ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
LEO:
Here in America, you are considering false redemption of a pawn ticket-- theft, identity theft.
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
Das in seventh grade science metal den?
Impersonation with intent to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
(sighs)
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled ukulele wrong-- too many E's and L's.
Unless....
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
We can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
You know what?
Come here.
What?
Recently, you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing, health, vermin.
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
What happened to it?
Girl smashed it to bits.
A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
WALTER:
The girlfriend who smashed it-- what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
LEO:
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right, well, what local cops like to do these days is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
MAN:
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl.
"Do not resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest.
Daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
No, man.
I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
(choking)
Leo?
Leo?
As a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
(grunts)
(sighs)
"Peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
Hmm.
(loud, overlapping chatter)
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Well, well.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Brittany Stephenson.
Looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Uh, something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior."
All right.
Oh.
(laughing):
Oy, oy, have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay, how's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
WALTER:
Hey, you live on a boat?
(sighs)
You're like herpes-- impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Okay, so, a tattoo:
Do Not Resuscitate, a boat:
Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise,
I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
Tide's shifting now, so...
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope.
It belongs to a client.
Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss, all right?
Well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
(engine starting)
WALTER:
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
How about you?
Nothing in her truck.
Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
That's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
WALTER:
Britanny's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
(typing)
WALTER:
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
What's this?
As promised.
(chuckles)
You-you did it.
That's, uh...
I was going to say "impossible," but clearly, it's not impossible, but...
I-I...
I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
(laughs)
This...
This is me and... my mom.
I...
I'm ex... extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I, um...
Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her to her office.
It's, um...
MONTENEGRO:
The security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
How accurate will this be?
100%.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
Really.
Boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
(shouting over engine noise):
You pretty confident of your arithmetic?
(shouting):
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head.
It's correct.
(beeping)
Then we are here.
(engine quiets)
Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
For Brittany?
More concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip.
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah,
I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
(through radio):
Naw.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
IKE:
You might want to rethink your maths.
Do you see anything?
WALTER:
Yeah.
LEO (through headset):
What did you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
WALTER:
Not aberjacks.
Brittany.
Britanny Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
SAROYAN:
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
Me.
No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding
(clicking) pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh!
Ooh, what?
You find something?
(squishing)
BOOTH:
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
BOOTH:
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
Wait a second.
Is that blood?
SAROYAN:
Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
Enough for DNA?
SAROYAN:
If our killer's in the database.
Whoa...
More than enough.
(groan) She bit the attacker's finger off.
Unfortunately...
BOOTH:
Wow.
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Di-Don't touch that, Wally.
That's evidence.
Please, come on.
This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses-- mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
BOOTH:
Yeah, two murders.
BRENNAN:
Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it;
in her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously.
BISHOP:
Before I tell you what I know,
I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
You got a deal, Eddie.
Please... address me as "Excellency."
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I lost it;
now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
BISHOP:
Where exactly did the three nails appear?
Here.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
WALTER:
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl-girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
(heavy exhale)
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Mmm.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You are a Jesuit...
Excellency.
(sighs)
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
a Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me;
I hate that.
(exhales)
You know, you really should've broached the subject of his mental health before you told him what he needed to know.
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered.
I asked what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey.
Why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
Well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So, why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
LEO:
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
It's human psychology.
It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
Where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
LEO:
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
LEO:
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky."
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
It's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
You call it paranoia:
I call it epiphany.
You want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind."
What?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
BRENNAN:
Booth?
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
What?
There are three nails on the chart.
Here.
See?
Clear as day.
So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
If you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
MONTENEGRO:
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees;
no question:
no debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
MONTENEGRO:
No.
Because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
BOOTH:
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
BRENNAN:
But at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
MONTENEGRO:
I don't know how he could have.
BOOTH:
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
These are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
It's genuine, 17th century
Madonna della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh...
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand, in and of itself, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
Where else could that have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Uh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not the police.
So, what do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
(grunts)
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
(grunts)
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter...
I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah...
I'd never risk that, Leo.
BOOTH:
Maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure "stealing"?
He was working for the FBI-- right?
-- when he found that treasure.
And he can't just keep it.
Oh...
Why do you dislike Walter so much?
Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
- Right?
- Right.
So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
That was his job.
His job?
Sometimes... you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
(engine revs, horn honks)
Whoa.
(tires screech, engine stops)
Oy!
G-man, Skeleton-Babe.
(snaps fingers)
We've been looking all over town for you.
Okay.
Is this the treasure?
BOOTH:
Yeah, it better be.
Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not,
I'm going to arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
Arrest him on what charge?
Booth says that
Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking, and acting upon my advice,
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
That's true.
What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
- That's not...
- No.
We reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What, the Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
(muffled shouts) Booth.
(pounding on box) This isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
Oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
All righty.
Whoa, whoa!
No-no-no-no.
No, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No you're not, 'cause if you do,
I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
(door slams shut)
Lambert Chaisson.
BOOTH:
Hey, Buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You want to try it on?
WALTER:
"Drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
LEO:
Are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
LEO:
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
IKE:
"Op-ti-mi-tist..."
(out-of-tune ukulele strumming)
"...versus Fool."
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing
Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
Until now.
Because the bones lady could be the one.
Told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not.
But it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you-- there you go-- and you can't make me.
Cheers to that.
Fair enough.
Right?
Got your medal back.

How did we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
That is right.
Male, late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
So, where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals.
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
Feral hogs?
Mm-hmm.
Sure.
The serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
Great that's all I need.
Just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?
You bet.
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye, yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
Well...
Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik-- he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
Was this some kind of an accident?
Body dump.
Murder?
- Who would murder Sam?
- Traditionally, that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues?
You know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
This is the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
Something sneaky, that's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
What's it worth?
Well, that depends who you talk to.
We're talking to you.
It's worthless, until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
- Treasure ship?
- So when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes, I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
- Diviners?
- I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
No, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
What I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody
I could put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water, maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
That son of a bitch has got the finder power.
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
- Walter?
- You mind?
We got an important
"philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"
which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai."
- Samurai.
- You know what?
He's right.
I'd definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet?
Straight up, right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
Who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
You still on retainer with the FBI?
Well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
Okay.
Oh.
You see that?
FBI.
No.
- How about you?
- Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No.
- Why not?
Just give...
That's going to be bad.
Too late now.
He's very suspicious.
Why'd you give him that?
You shouldn't just...
Now he's biting my ID.
He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
All right.
Give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID.
I'm not done with it yet.
Give me the ID.
Give me back...
Give me back the ID.
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
A little help.
Leo, where you going?
Cold beer while you wait?
Give back the ID.
Wait for what?
Booth, knock it off.
For the boys to get reacquainted.

You know, I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
It wouldn't do you any good.
A while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh-- shall we say a guardian angel on his shoulder?
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
Uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
"Whatever it is" is a map.
It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
Seriously?
Focus.
Can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
No.
No.
Would you sleep with me?
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
It's a treasure map, okay?
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in or are you out?
You know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
That doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
But I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
What?
No.
Who told you to get my cell phone number?
Oh, just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones...
Okay.
Tell him...
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade,
I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to...
That's all I need.
Um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D.C.?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial.
So why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Gotta go.
Fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
Pudge pulled down $375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
Total novice.
Tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
You want to come with?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
Miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right. 'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you?
The day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
To make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
Then thy shall walk in thy way safely.

Okay, story so far:
clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime.
Except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes
Pudge to steal the map,
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
Otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller ID?
Caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
No, he told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
Pawnshop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Well, me, too.
For each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
My name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
Ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
Here in America, you are considering false redemption of a pawn ticket-- theft, identity theft.
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
Das in seventh grade science metal den?
Impersonation with intent to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled ukulele wrong-- too many E's and L's.
Unless....
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
We can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
You know what?
Come here.
What?
Recently, you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing, health, vermin.
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
What happened to it?
Girl smashed it to bits.
A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
The girlfriend who smashed it-- what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right, well, what local cops like to do these days is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl.
"Do not resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest.
Daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
No, man.
I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
Leo?
Leo?
As a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
"Peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
Hmm.
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Well, well.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Brittany Stephenson.
Looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Uh, something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior."
All right.
Oh.
Oy, oy, have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay, how's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
Hey, you live on a boat?
You're like herpes-- impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Okay, so, a tattoo:
Do Not Resuscitate, a boat:
Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise,
I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
Tide's shifting now, so...
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope.
It belongs to a client.
Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss, all right?
Well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
How about you?
Nothing in her truck.
Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
That's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
Britanny's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
What's this?
As promised.
You-you did it.
That's, uh...
I was going to say "impossible," but clearly, it's not impossible, but...
I-I...
I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
This...
This is me and... my mom.
I...
I'm ex... extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I, um...
Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her to her office.
It's, um...
The security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
How accurate will this be?
100%.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
Really.
Boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
You pretty confident of your arithmetic?
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head.
It's correct.
Then we are here.
Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
For Brittany?
More concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip.
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah,
I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
Naw.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
You might want to rethink your maths.
Do you see anything?
Yeah.
LEO What did you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
Not aberjacks.
Brittany.
Britanny Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
Me.
No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh!
Ooh, what?
You find something?
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
Wait a second.
Is that blood?
Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
Enough for DNA?
If our killer's in the database.
Whoa...
More than enough.
She bit the attacker's finger off.
Unfortunately...
Wow.
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Di-Don't touch that, Wally.
That's evidence.
Please, come on.
This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses-- mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
- Yeah, two murders.
- Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it;
in her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously.
Before I tell you what I know,
I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
You got a deal, Eddie.
Please... address me as "Excellency."
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I lost it;
now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
Where exactly did the three nails appear?
Here.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl-girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Mmm.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You are a Jesuit...
Excellency.
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
a Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me;
I hate that.
You know, you really should've broached the subject of his mental health before you told him what he needed to know.
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered.
I asked what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey.
Why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
Well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So, why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
It's human psychology.
It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
Where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky."
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
It's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
You call it paranoia:
I call it epiphany.
You want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind."
What?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
Booth?
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
What?
There are three nails on the chart.
Here.
See?
Clear as day.
So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
If you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees;
no question:
no debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
No.
Because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
But at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
I don't know how he could have.
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
These are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
It's genuine, 17th century
Madonna della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh...
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand, in and of itself, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
Where else could that have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Uh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not the police.
So, what do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter...
I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah...
I'd never risk that, Leo.
Maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure "stealing"?
He was working for the FBI-- right?
-- when he found that treasure.
And he can't just keep it.
Oh...
Why do you dislike Walter so much?
Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
- Right?
- Right.
So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
That was his job.
His job?
Sometimes... you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
Whoa.
Oy!
G-man, Skeleton-Babe.
We've been looking all over town for you.
Okay.
Is this the treasure?
Yeah, it better be.
Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not,
I'm going to arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
Arrest him on what charge?
Booth says that
Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking, and acting upon my advice,
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
That's true.
What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
- That's not...
- No.
We reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What, the Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
Booth.
This isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
Oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
All righty.
Whoa, whoa!
No-no-no-no.
No, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No you're not, 'cause if you do,
I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
Lambert Chaisson.
Hey, Buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You want to try it on?
"Drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
Are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
"Op-ti-mi-tist..."
"...versus Fool."
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing
Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
Until now.
Because the bones lady could be the one.
Told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not.
But it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you-- there you go-- and you can't make me.
Cheers to that.
Fair enough.
Right?
Got your medal back.

How did we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
That is right.
Male, late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
So, where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals.
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
Feral hogs?
Mm-hmm.
Sure.
The serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
Great that's all I need.
Just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?
You bet.
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye, yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
Well...
Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik-- he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
Was this some kind of an accident?
Body dump.
Murder?
- Who would murder Sam?
- Traditionally, that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues?
You know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
This is the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
Something sneaky, that's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
What's it worth?
Well, that depends who you talk to.
We're talking to you.
It's worthless, until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
- Treasure ship?
- So when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes, I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
- Diviners?
- I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
No, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
What I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody
I could put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water, maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
That son of a bitch has got the finder power.
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
- Walter?
- You mind?
We got an important
"philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"
which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai."
Samurai.
You know what?
He's right.
I'd definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet?
Straight up, right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
Who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
You still on retainer with the FBI?
Well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
Okay.
Oh.
You see that?
FBI.
No.
- How about you?
- Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No.
- Why not?
Just give...
That's going to be bad.
Too late now.
He's very suspicious.
Why'd you give him that?
You shouldn't just...
Now he's biting my ID.
He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
All right.
Give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID.
I'm not done with it yet.
Give me the ID.
Give me back...
Give me back the ID.
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
A little help.
Leo, where you going?
Cold beer while you wait?
Give back the ID.
Wait for what?
Booth, knock it off.
For the boys to get reacquainted.

You know, I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
It wouldn't do you any good.
A while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh-- shall we say a guardian angel on his shoulder?
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
Uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
"Whatever it is" is a map.
It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
Seriously?
Focus.
Can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
No.
No.
Would you sleep with me?
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
It's a treasure map, okay?
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in or are you out?
You know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
That doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
But I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
What?
No.
Who told you to get my cell phone number?
Oh, just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones...
Okay.
Tell him...
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade,
I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to...
That's all I need.
Um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D.C.?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial.
So why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Gotta go.
Fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
Pudge pulled down $375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
Total novice.
Tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
You want to come with?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
Miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right. 'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you?
The day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
To make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
Then thy shall walk in thy way safely.

Okay, story so far:
clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime.
Except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes
Pudge to steal the map,
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
Otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller ID?
Caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
No, he told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
Pawnshop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Well, me, too.
For each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
My name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
Ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
Here in America, you are considering false redemption of a pawn ticket-- theft, identity theft.
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
Das in seventh grade science metal den?
Impersonation with intent to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled ukulele wrong-- too many E's and L's.
Unless....
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
We can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
You know what?
Come here.
What?
Recently, you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing, health, vermin.
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
What happened to it?
Girl smashed it to bits.
A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
The girlfriend who smashed it-- what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right, well, what local cops like to do these days is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl.
"Do not resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest.
Daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
No, man.
I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
Leo?
Leo?
As a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
"Peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
Hmm.
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Well, well.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Brittany Stephenson.
Looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Uh, something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior."
All right.
Oh.
Oy, oy, have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay, how's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
Hey, you live on a boat?
You're like herpes-- impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Okay, so, a tattoo:
Do Not Resuscitate, a boat:
Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise,
I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
Tide's shifting now, so...
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope.
It belongs to a client.
Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss, all right?
Well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
How about you?
Nothing in her truck.
Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
That's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
Britanny's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
What's this?
As promised.
You-you did it.
That's, uh...
I was going to say "impossible," but clearly, it's not impossible, but...
I-I...
I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
This...
This is me and... my mom.
I...
I'm ex... extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I, um...
Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her to her office.
It's, um...
The security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
How accurate will this be?
100%.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
Really.
Boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
You pretty confident of your arithmetic?
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head.
It's correct.
Then we are here.
Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
For Brittany?
More concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip.
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah,
I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
Naw.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
You might want to rethink your maths.
Do you see anything?
Yeah.
LEO What did you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
Not aberjacks.
Brittany.
Britanny Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
Me.
No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh!
Ooh, what?
You find something?
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
Wait a second.
Is that blood?
Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
Enough for DNA?
If our killer's in the database.
Whoa...
More than enough.
She bit the attacker's finger off.
Unfortunately...
Wow.
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Di-Don't touch that, Wally.
That's evidence.
Please, come on.
This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses-- mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
Yeah, two murders.
Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it;
in her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously.
Before I tell you what I know,
I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
You got a de, Eddie.
Please... address me as "Excellency."
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I lost it;
now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
Where exactly did the three nails appear?
Here.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl-girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Mmm.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You are a Jesuit...
Excellency.
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
a Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me;
I hate that.
You know, you really should've broached the subject of his mental health before you told him what he needed to know.
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered.
I asked what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey.
Why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
Well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So, why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
It's human psychology.
It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
Where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky."
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
It's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
You call it paranoia:
I call it epiphany.
You want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind."
What?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
Booth?
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
What?
There are three nails on the chart.
Here.
See?
Clear as day.
So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
If you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees;
no question:
no debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
No.
Because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
But at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
I don't know how he could have.
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
These are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
It's genuine, 17th century
Madonna della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh...
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand, in and of itself, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
Where else could that have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Uh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not the police.
So, what do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter...
I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah...
I'd never risk that, Leo.
Maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure "stealing"?
He was working for the FBI-- right?
-- when he found that treasure.
And he can't just keep it.
Oh...
Why do you dislike Walter so much?
Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
Right?
Right.
So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
That was his job.
His job?
Sometimes... you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
Whoa.
Oy!
G-man, Skeleton-Babe.
We've been looking all over town for you.
Okay.
Is this the treasure?
Yeah, it better be.
Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not,
I'm going to arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
Arrest him on what charge?
Booth says that
Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking, and acting upon my advice,
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
That's true.
What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
- That's not...
- No.
We reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What, the Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
Booth.
This isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
Oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
All righty.
Whoa, whoa!
No-no-no-no.
No, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No you're not, 'cause if you do,
I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
Lambert Chaisson.
Hey, Buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You want to try it on?
"Drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
Are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
"Op-ti-mi-tist..."
"...versus Fool."
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing
Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
Until now.
Because the bones lady could be the one.
Told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not.
But it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you-- there you go-- and you can't make me.
Cheers to that.
Fair enough.
Right?
Got your medal back.

How did we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
That is right.
Male, late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
So, where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals.
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
- Feral hogs?
- Mm-hmm.
Sure.
The serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
Great that's all I need.
Just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?
You bet.
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye, yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
Well...
Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik... he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
- Was this some kind of an accident?
- Body dump.
Murder?
Who would murder Sam?
Traditionally, that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues?
You know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
This is the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
Something sneaky, that's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
What's it worth?
Well, that depends who you talk to.
We're talking to you.
It's worthless, until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
- Treasure ship?
- So when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes, I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
Diviners?
I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
No, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
What I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody
I could put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water, maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
That son of a bitch has got the finder power.
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
Walter?
You mind?
We got an important "philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"
which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai."
- -
- You know what?
He's right.
I'd definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet?
Straight up, right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
Who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
You still on retainer with the FBI?
Well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
Okay.
Oh.
You see that?
FBI.
No.
How about you?
Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No.
- Why not?
Just give...
That's going to be bad.
Too late now.
He's very suspicious.
Why'd you give him that?
You shouldn't just...
Now he's biting my ID.
- He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
- All right.
Give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID.
I'm not done with it yet.
Give me the ID.
Give me back...
Give me back the ID.
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
A little help.
Leo, where you going?
Cold beer while you wait?
- Give back the ID.
- Wait for what?
Booth, knock it off.
For the boys to get reacquainted.
You know, I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
It wouldn't do you any good.
A while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh... shall we say a guardian angel on his shoulder?
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
Uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
"Whatever it is" is a map.
It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
Seriously?
Focus.
Can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
No.
No.
Would you sleep with me?
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
It's a treasure map, okay?
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in or are you out?
You know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
That doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
But I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
What?
No.
Who told you to get my cell phone number?
Oh, just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones...
Okay.
Tell him...
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade,
I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to...
That's all I need.
Um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D.C.?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial.
So why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Gotta go.
Fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
Pudge pulled down $375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
Total novice.
Tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
You want to come with?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
Miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right. 'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you?
The day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
To make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
Then thy shall walk in thy way safely.
Do you know what you are?
You're an enable-izer.

Who is this?
It's me.
You been in there long enough.
Okay, story so far:
Clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime.
Except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes.
Pudge to steal the map,
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
Otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller ID?
Caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
No, he told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
Pawnshop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Well, me, too.
For each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
My name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
Ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
Here in America, you are considering false redemption of a pawn ticket... theft, identity theft.
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
Das in seventh grade science metal den?
Impersonation with intent to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled ukulele wrong... too many E's and L's.
Unless....
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
We can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
You know what?
Come here.
What?
Recently, you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing, health, vermin.
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
What happened to it?
Girl smashed it to bits.
A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
The girlfriend who smashed it...
what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right, well, what local cops like to do these days is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl.
"Do not resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest.
Daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
No, man.
I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
Leo?
Leo?
As a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
"Peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
Hmm.
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Well, well.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Brittany Stephenson.
Looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Uh, , something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior."
All right.
Oh.
Oy, oy, have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay, how's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
Hey, you live on a boat?
You're like herpes...
impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Do Not Resuscitate, a boat:
Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise,
I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
Tide's shifting now, so...
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope.
It belongs to a client.
Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss, all right?
Well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
How about you?
Nothing in her truck.
Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
That's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
Britanny's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
What's this?
As promised.
You-you did it.
That's, uh...
I was going to say "impossible," but clearly, it's not impossible, but...
I-I...
I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
This...
This is me and... my mom.
I...
I'm ex... extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I, um...
Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her to her office.
It's, um...
The security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
How accurate will this be?
100%.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
Really.
Boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
You pretty confident of your arithmetic?
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head.
It's correct.
Then we are here.
Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
For Brittany?
More concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip.
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah,
I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
Naw.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
You might want to rethink your maths.
Do you see anything?
Yeah.
What did you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
Not aberjacks.
Brittany.
Britanny Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
Me.
No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh!
Ooh, what?
You find something?
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
Wait a second.
Is that blood?
Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
Enough for DNA?
If our killer's in the database.
Whoa...
More than enough.
She bit the attacker's finger off.
Unfortunately...
Wow.
Digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Di-Don't touch that, Wally.
That's evidence.
Please, come on.
This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses... mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
- Yeah, two murders.
- Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it;
In her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously.
Before I tell you what I know,
I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
You got a deal, Eddie.
Please... address me as "Excellency."
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I lost it;
Now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
Where exactly did the three nails appear?
Here.
"Follow your leader."
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl-girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Mmm.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You are a Jesuit...
Excellency.
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
A Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me;
I hate that.
You know, you really should've broached the subject of his mental health before you told him what he needed to know.
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered.
I asked what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey.
Why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
Well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So, why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
It's human psychology.
It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
Where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky."
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
It's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
I call it epiphany.
You want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind."
What?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
Booth?
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
What?
There are three nails on the chart.
Here.
See?
Clear as day.
So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
If you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees;
No question:
No debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
No.
Because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
But at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
I don't know how he could have.
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
These are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
It's genuine, 17th century
Madonna della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh...
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand, in and of itself, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
Where else could that have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Uh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not the police.
So, what do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter...
I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah...
I'd never risk that, Leo.
Maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure "stealing"?
He was working for the FBI... right?
... when he found that treasure.
And he can't just keep it.
Oh...
Why do you dislike Walter so much?
Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
Right?
Right.
So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
That was his job.
His job?
Sometimes... you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
Whoa.
Oy!
G-man, Skeleton-Babe.
We've been looking all over town for you.
Okay.
Is this the treasure?
Yeah, it better be.
Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not,
I'm going to arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
Arrest him on what charge?
Booth says that
Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking, and acting upon my advice,
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
That's true.
What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
That's not...
No.
We reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What, the Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
Booth.
This isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
Oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
All righty.
Whoa, whoa!
No-no-no-no.
No, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No you're not, 'cause if you do,
I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
Lambert Chaisson.
Hey, Buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You want to try it on?
"Drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
Are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
"Op-ti-mi-tist..."
"...versus Fool."
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing
Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
Until now.
Because the bones lady could be the one.
Told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not.
But it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you... there you go...
and you can't make me.
Cheers to that.
Right?
Fair enough.
Got your medal back.

How did we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
BOOTH:
That is right.
BRENNAN:
Male, late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
So, where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
SHERIFF:
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals.
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
BOOTH:
Feral hogs?
Mm-hmm.
Sure.
The serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
BOOTH:
Great that's all I need.
Just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?
You bet.
MAN:
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye, yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
Well...
Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik-- he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
Was this some kind of an accident?
Body dump.
Murder?
- Who would murder Sam?
- Traditionally, that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues?
You know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
This is the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
BOOTH:
Something sneaky, that's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
What's it worth?
Well, that depends who you talk to.
We're talking to you.
It's worthless, until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
- Treasure ship?
- So when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes, I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
- Diviners?
- I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
No, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
What I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody
I could put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water, maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
That son of a bitch has got the finder power.
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
- Walter?
- You mind?
We got an important
"philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"
which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai."
Samurai.
BOOTH:
You know what?
He's right.
I'd definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet?
Straight up, right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
Who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
You still on retainer with the FBI?
Well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
Okay.
Oh.
You see that?
FBI.
No.
- How about you?
- Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No.
- Why not?
Just give...
That's going to be bad.
Too late now.
He's very suspicious.
Why'd you give him that?
You shouldn't just...
Now he's biting my ID.
He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
All right.
Give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID.
I'm not done with it yet.
Give me the ID.
(both grunting) Give me back...
Give me back the ID.
(crashing, Walter grunts)
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
A little help.
(crashing)
Leo, where you going?
Cold beer while you wait?
Give back the ID.
Wait for what?
(both grunting)
Booth, knock it off.
For the boys to get reacquainted.

You know, I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
WALTER:
It wouldn't do you any good.
A while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh-- shall we say a guardian angel (ringing) on his shoulder?
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
Uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
"Whatever it is" is a map.
It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
BOOTH:
Seriously?
Focus.
Can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
(laughing):
No.
No.
Would you sleep with me?
BOOTH:
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
(mouths)
WALTER:
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
BOOTH:
It's a treasure map, okay?
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in or are you out?
You know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
That doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
But I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
What?
No.
Who told you to get my cell phone number?
BOOTH:
Oh, just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
BRENNAN:
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones...
Okay.
Tell him...
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade,
I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to...
That's all I need.
Um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D.C.?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial.
So why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Gotta go.
Fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
Pudge pulled down $375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
LEO:
You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
Total novice.
Tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
You want to come with?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
Miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right. 'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you?
The day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
To make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
Then thy shall walk in thy way safely.

(cell phone ringing)
Who is this?
It's me.
You been in there long enough.
WALTER:
Okay, story so far:
clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime.
Except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes
Pudge to steal the map,
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
Otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
(phone chimes)
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller ID?
Caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
No, he told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
Pawnshop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Well, me, too.
(toilet flushes)
(flushing)
For each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
(with German accent):
My name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
Ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
LEO:
Here in America, you are considering false redemption of a pawn ticket-- theft, identity theft.
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
Das in seventh grade science metal den?
Impersonation with intent to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
(sighs)
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled ukulele wrong-- too many E's and L's.
Unless....
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
We can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
You know what?
Come here.
What?
Recently, you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing, health, vermin.
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
What happened to it?
Girl smashed it to bits.
A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
WALTER:
The girlfriend who smashed it-- what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
LEO:
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right, well, what local cops like to do these days is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
MAN:
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl.
"Do not resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest.
Daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
No, man.
I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
(choking)
Leo?
Leo?
As a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
(grunts)
(sighs)
"Peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
Hmm.
(loud, overlapping chatter)
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Well, well.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Brittany Stephenson.
Looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Uh, something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior."
All right.
Oh.
(laughing):
Oy, oy, have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay, how's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
WALTER:
Hey, you live on a boat?
(sighs)
You're like herpes-- impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Okay, so, a tattoo:
Do Not Resuscitate, a boat:
Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise,
I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
Tide's shifting now, so...
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope.
It belongs to a client.
Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss, all right?
Well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
(engine starting)
WALTER:
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
How about you?
Nothing in her truck.
Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
That's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
WALTER:
Britanny's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
(typing)
WALTER:
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
What's this?
As promised.
(chuckles)
You-you did it.
That's, uh...
I was going to say "impossible," but clearly, it's not impossible, but...
I-I...
I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
(laughs)
This...
This is me and... my mom.
I...
I'm ex... extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I, um...
Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her to her office.
It's, um...
MONTENEGRO:
The security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
How accurate will this be?
100%.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
Really.
Boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
(shouting over engine noise):
You pretty confident of your arithmetic?
(shouting):
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head.
It's correct.
(beeping)
Then we are here.
(engine quiets)
Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
For Brittany?
More concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip.
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah,
I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
(through radio):
Naw.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
IKE:
You might want to rethink your maths.
Do you see anything?
WALTER:
Yeah.
LEO (through headset):
What did you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
WALTER:
Not aberjacks.
Brittany.
Britanny Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
SAROYAN:
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
Me.
No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding
(clicking) pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh!
Ooh, what?
You find something?
(squishing)
BOOTH:
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
BOOTH:
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
Wait a second.
Is that blood?
SAROYAN:
Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
Enough for DNA?
SAROYAN:
If our killer's in the database.
Whoa...
More than enough.
(groan) She bit the attacker's finger off.
Unfortunately...
BOOTH:
Wow.
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Di-Don't touch that, Wally.
That's evidence.
Please, come on.
This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses-- mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
BOOTH:
Yeah, two murders.
BRENNAN:
Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it;
in her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously.
BISHOP:
Before I tell you what I know,
I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
You got a de, Eddie.
Please... address me as "Excellency."
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I lost it;
now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
BISHOP:
Where exactly did the three nails appear?
Here.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
WALTER:
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl-girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
(heavy exhale)
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Mmm.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You are a Jesuit...
Excellency.
(sighs)
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
a Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me;
I hate that.
(exhales)
You know, you really should've broached the subject of his mental health before you told him what he needed to know.
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered.
I asked what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey.
Why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
Well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So, why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
LEO:
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
It's human psychology.
It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
Where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
LEO:
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
LEO:
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky."
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
It's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
You call it paranoia:
I call it epiphany.
You want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind."
What?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
BRENNAN:
Booth?
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
What?
There are three nails on the chart.
Here.
See?
Clear as day.
So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
If you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
MONTENEGRO:
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees;
no question:
no debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
MONTENEGRO:
No.
Because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
BOOTH:
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
BRENNAN:
But at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
MONTENEGRO:
I don't know how he could have.
BOOTH:
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
These are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
It's genuine, 17th century
Madonna della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh...
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand, in and of itself, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
Where else could that have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Uh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not the police.
So, what do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
(grunts)
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
(grunts)
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter...
I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah...
I'd never risk that, Leo.
BOOTH:
Maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure "stealing"?
He was working for the FBI-- right?
-- when he found that treasure.
And he can't just keep it.
Oh...
Why do you dislike Walter so much?
Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
Right?
Right.
So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
That was his job.
His job?
Sometimes... you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
(engine revs, horn honks)
Whoa.
(tires screech, engine stops)
Oy!
G-man, Skeleton-Babe.
(snaps fingers)
We've been looking all over town for you.
Okay.
Is this the treasure?
BOOTH:
Yeah, it better be.
Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not,
I'm going to arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
Arrest him on what charge?
Booth says that
Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking, and acting upon my advice,
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
That's true.
What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
- That's not...
- No.
We reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What, the Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
(muffled shouts) Booth.
(pounding on box) This isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
Oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
All righty.
Whoa, whoa!
No-no-no-no.
No, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No you're not, 'cause if you do,
I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
(door slams shut)
Lambert Chaisson.
BOOTH:
Hey, Buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You want to try it on?
WALTER:
"Drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
LEO:
Are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
LEO:
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
IKE:
"Op-ti-mi-tist..."
(out-of-tune ukulele strumming)
"...versus Fool."
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing
Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
Until now.
Because the bones lady could be the one.
Told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not.
But it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you-- there you go-- and you can't make me.
Cheers to that.
Fair enough.
Right?
Got your medal back.

How did we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
That is right.
Male, late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
So, where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals.
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
Feral hogs?
Mm-hmm.
Sure.
The serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
Great that's all I need.
Just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?
You bet.
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye, yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
Well...
Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik-- he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
Was this some kind of an accident?
Body dump.
Murder?
- Who would murder Sam?
- Traditionally, that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues?
You know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
This is the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
Something sneaky, that's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
What's it worth?
Well, that depends who you talk to.
We're talking to you.
It's worthless, until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
- Treasure ship?
- So when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes, I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
- Diviners?
- I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
No, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
What I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody
I could put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water, maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
That son of a bitch has got the finder power.
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
- Walter?
- You mind?
We got an important
"philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"
which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai."
Samurai.
You know what?
He's right.
I'd definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet?
Straight up, right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
Who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
You still on retainer with the FBI?
Well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
Okay.
Oh.
You see that?
FBI.
No.
- How about you?
- Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No.
- Why not?
Just give...
That's going to be bad.
Too late now.
He's very suspicious.
Why'd you give him that?
You shouldn't just...
Now he's biting my ID.
He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
All right.
Give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID.
I'm not done with it yet.
Give me the ID.
Give me back...
Give me back the ID.
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
A little help.
Leo, where you going?
Cold beer while you wait?
Give back the ID.
Wait for what?
Booth, knock it off.
For the boys to get reacquainted.

You know, I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
It wouldn't do you any good.
A while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh-- shall we say a guardian angel on his shoulder?
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
Uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
"Whatever it is" is a map.
It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
Seriously?
Focus.
Can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
No.
No.
Would you sleep with me?
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
It's a treasure map, okay?
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in or are you out?
You know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
That doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
But I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
What?
No.
Who told you to get my cell phone number?
Oh, just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones...
Okay.
Tell him...
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade,
I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to...
That's all I need.
Um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D.C.?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial.
So why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Gotta go.
Fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
Pudge pulled down $375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
Total novice.
Tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
You want to come with?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
Miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right. 'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you?
The day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
To make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
Then thy shall walk in thy way safely.

Okay, story so far:
clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime.
Except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes
Pudge to steal the map,
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
Otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller ID?
Caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
No, he told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
Pawnshop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Well, me, too.
For each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
My name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
Ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
Here in America, you are considering false redemption of a pawn ticket-- theft, identity theft.
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
Das in seventh grade science metal den?
Impersonation with intent to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled ukulele wrong-- too many E's and L's.
Unless....
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
We can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
You know what?
Come here.
What?
Recently, you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing, health, vermin.
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
What happened to it?
Girl smashed it to bits.
A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
The girlfriend who smashed it-- what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right, well, what local cops like to do these days is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl.
"Do not resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest.
Daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
No, man.
I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
Leo?
Leo?
As a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
"Peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
Hmm.
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Well, well.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Brittany Stephenson.
Looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Uh, something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior."
All right.
Oh.
Oy, oy, have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay, how's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
Hey, you live on a boat?
You're like herpes-- impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Okay, so, a tattoo:
Do Not Resuscitate, a boat:
Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise,
I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
Tide's shifting now, so...
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope.
It belongs to a client.
Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss, all right?
Well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
How about you?
Nothing in her truck.
Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
That's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
Britanny's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
What's this?
As promised.
You-you did it.
That's, uh...
I was going to say "impossible," but clearly, it's not impossible, but...
I-I...
I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
This...
This is me and... my mom.
I...
I'm ex... extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I, um...
Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her to her office.
It's, um...
The security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
How accurate will this be?
100%.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
Really.
Boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
You pretty confident of your arithmetic?
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head.
It's correct.
Then we are here.
Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
For Brittany?
More concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip.
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah,
I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
Naw.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
You might want to rethink your maths.
Do you see anything?
Yeah.
LEO What did you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
Not aberjacks.
Brittany.
Britanny Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
Me.
No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh!
Ooh, what?
You find something?
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
Wait a second.
Is that blood?
Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
Enough for DNA?
If our killer's in the database.
Whoa...
More than enough.
She bit the attacker's finger off.
Unfortunately...
Wow.
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Di-Don't touch that, Wally.
That's evidence.
Please, come on.
This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses-- mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
Yeah, two murders.
Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it;
in her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously.
Before I tell you what I know,
I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
You got a de, Eddie.
Please... address me as "Excellency."
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I lost it;
now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
Where exactly did the three nails appear?
Here.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl-girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Mmm.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You are a Jesuit...
Excellency.
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
a Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me;
I hate that.
You know, you really should've broached the subject of his mental health before you told him what he needed to know.
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered.
I asked what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey.
Why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
Well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So, why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
It's human psychology.
It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
Where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky."
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
It's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
You call it paranoia:
I call it epiphany.
You want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind."
What?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
Booth?
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
What?
There are three nails on the chart.
Here.
See?
Clear as day.
So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
If you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees;
no question:
no debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
No.
Because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
But at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
I don't know how he could have.
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
These are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
It's genuine, 17th century
Madonna della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh...
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand, in and of itself, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
Where else could that have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Uh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not the police.
So, what do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter...
I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah...
I'd never risk that, Leo.
Maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure "stealing"?
He was working for the FBI-- right?
-- when he found that treasure.
And he can't just keep it.
Oh...
Why do you dislike Walter so much?
Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
Right?
Right.
So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
That was his job.
His job?
Sometimes... you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
Whoa.
Oy!
G-man, Skeleton-Babe.
We've been looking all over town for you.
Okay.
Is this the treasure?
Yeah, it better be.
Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not,
I'm going to arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
Arrest him on what charge?
Booth says that
Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking, and acting upon my advice,
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
That's true.
What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
- That's not...
- No.
We reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What, the Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
Booth.
This isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
Oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
All righty.
Whoa, whoa!
No-no-no-no.
No, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No you're not, 'cause if you do,
I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
Lambert Chaisson.
Hey, Buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You want to try it on?
"Drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
Are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
"Op-ti-mi-tist..."
"...versus Fool."
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing
Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
Until now.
Because the bones lady could be the one.
Told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not.
But it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you-- there you go-- and you can't make me.
Cheers to that.
Fair enough.
Right?
Got your medal back.

How did we even find these remains?
We passed the middle of nowhere about an hour ago.
That's not a legitimate geographical reference.
Anonymous call gave us the exact GPS coordinates.
Everglades makes it FBI jurisdiction.
Bones makes it your jurisdiction.
That is right.
Male, late 20s.
Visually impaired.
I kind of figured that out with the glass eye there.
So, where are the clothes?
There's no clothes.
Well, when you want to get rid of a body, you don't want nothing between the teeth and the meat.
Extensive evidence of mammal, fish, reptile and bird scavenging.
This appears to be scoring from human teeth.
Yeah, we get that.
Cannibals.
Feral hogs.
Hogs got people teeth.
I know a guy made his own set of dentures that way.
Feral hogs?
Mm-hmm.
Sure.
The serial number for this prosthetic eye is discernible.
Great that's all I need.
Just give me the serial number, I'll just text it back to the Miami field office and we'll know the identity before we even get back to civilization.
Isn't that right, Sheriff?
You bet.
You identified Sam through his glass eye?
Acrylic eye, yes.
Does that mean his eye is all that's left of him?
Well...
Pretty much.
Yeah, I'd say pretty much.
So, Nozik-- he worked here as a security guard?
Yes.
I'm the museum's head curator.
We specialize in historical maritime artifacts.
Was this some kind of an accident?
Body dump.
Murder?
- Who would murder Sam?
- Traditionally, that is the question we ask.
Did he have any problems, issues?
You know, things like that?
There's something you should see.
That's Sam Nozik?
Yes.
He failed to report for work ten days ago.
72 hours later, we reported him missing.
This is the last footage we have of Sam.
What is he doing?
Something sneaky, that's for sure.
I mean, look at him.
He stole an 18th century nautical chart fragment.
Our most recent acquisition.
What's it worth?
Well, that depends who you talk to.
We're talking to you.
It's worthless, until it's authenticated.
Authenticated as what?
The final resting place of the Spanish treasure ship Santa Esperanza.
She sank during a storm in the spring of 1774.
- Treasure ship?
- So when you say worthless, what you actually mean is the exact opposite.
No.
Yes, I get your point.
But there have literally been dozens of these things over the years, and none has turned out to be authentic.
When it comes to such things, it's realistic to be a pessimist.
Looks like your security guard was an optimist.
Bones, you know those guys who use a forked stick to find water in the desert?
- Diviners?
- I know one.
I know a man who can do third degree polynomial equations in his head.
No, Bones, I'm not trying to have a conversation with you.
What I'm saying to you is I actually know somebody
I could put on the case.
To find the treasure?
Treasure maps have gotten people killed for hundreds of years.
It's a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water, maps reference land.
Find the map, find the murderer.
Possibly.
How does he find things?
That son of a bitch has got the finder power.
Which one is the son of a bitch?
The him there who isn't a her or the big man that's reading a book.
Come on.
Walter?
- Walter?
- You mind?
We got an important
"philiosophical" debate to resolve.
I think you mean "philosophical"
which also does not apply to "Ninja versus Samurai."
Samurai.
You know what?
He's right.
I'd definitely go with him.
Ninja is all stealth.
My bet?
Straight up, right on the warrior.
Nobody said anything about a bet, Booth.
You still gambling?
It's a figure of speech, Wally.
Who sent you?
We need you to find something.
Of course you need him to find something.
That's what he does.
His question was, and I quote, "Who sent you?"
Who are you?
Leo, Walter's legal advisor.
Ike there is his bartender.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian Institute.
All right, look.
You still on retainer with the FBI?
Well, if you were legitimate FBI, you'd know the answer to that question.
I'm going to have to see some credentials.
Okay.
Oh.
You see that?
FBI.
No.
- How about you?
- Here you go.
- No, don't give him that.
No.
- Why not?
Just give...
That's going to be bad.
Too late now.
He's very suspicious.
Why'd you give him that?
You shouldn't just...
Now he's biting my ID.
He's going to ruin the magnetic strip.
All right.
Give me the ID, Wally.
Wally, give me the ID.
I'm not done with it yet.
Give me the ID.
Give me back...
Give me back the ID.
Leo!
Leo!
You provoked this upon yourself.
Let me know how things turn out.
A little help.
Leo, where you going?
Cold beer while you wait?
Give back the ID.
Wait for what?
Booth, knock it off.
For the boys to get reacquainted.

You know, I could arrest you for assaulting a federal officer.
You know that, right?
It wouldn't do you any good.
A while back I found the attorney general's son in a crack den.
What is the connection between those two statements?
Walter here has a, uh-- shall we say a guardian angel on his shoulder?
Isn't that right, Wally?
We can't touch him.
People are very grateful when it comes to the what was once lost and now is found.
Uh, Pudge here is blind in one eye.
How can you tell?
It's the way he holds up that scrap of whatever is is to the light.
"Whatever it is" is a map.
It's a chart fragment, Mr. Sherman.
Oh, please, call me Walter.
Seriously?
Focus.
Can we?
Thank you.
Really.
Are you two sleeping together?
No.
No.
Would you sleep with me?
You know what?
You find the map, maybe you got a shot.
What?
He's drunk.
Look at him wobble and belch.
Uh, what kind of chart fragment?
It's a treasure map, okay?
The last location was the Santa something.
Esperanza.
Santa Esperanza.
So are you in or are you out?
You know, you're supposed to find that Chinese satellite what crashed to Earth in East Texas.
That doesn't sound real.
Oh, it's real.
I'll squeeze you in, for my old compadre.
But I'm the finder, you're the catchers.
I don't know what that means.
It means I'll find the chart fragment, but it's on you guys to catch the killer.
Great.
Done deal.
Let's go, Bones.
Okay.
Uh, can I get your cell number, please?
What?
No.
Who told you to get my cell phone number?
Oh, just relax.
Don't be paranoid.
In case I obtain any helpful information from the victim's remains back in D.C.
What exactly do you expect to find from a cracked-up bag of old bones?
Look, Bones has her thing, just like Walter here, all right?
Except my thing is real, not some imaginary finder power.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
What challenge?
He's upset that you said his finder power isn't real.
Tell me what you lost and I'll find it.
I haven't lost anything.
Everybody's lost something.
Bones...
Okay.
Tell him...
Tell him about that thing that you won that you lost.
Just tell him.
In seventh grade,
I won first place in my school science fair.
I lost the medal.
I went to...
That's all I need.
Um, do you guys want Ike to fly you back to D.C.?
She can have you there in a couple hours.
She's your bartender and your pilot?
What's with the sudden interest in Ike?
You know what?
We're gonna fly commercial.
So why don't you just go back inside and find yourself a necktie, all right?
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Chop-chop.
Come on.
Gotta go.
Fly commercial, they know where you're at at all times.
You get any kind of vibe of Pudge's place, Ike?
500 square feet, one bedroom, one bath, crap neighborhood, 600 bucks a month, max.
Pudge pulled down $375 a week.
Guy was totally living within his means.
You're saying he wasn't any kind of master thief.
Total novice.
Tell you what: somebody hired him to steal that map.
Well, no hidden key.
Break and enter?
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
You want to come with?
I'm your legal advisor, not your accomplice.
Miss you already.
He's not crazy.
Where I come from, we call Walter's gift "Darna Shealladh," the second sight.
Yeah, right. 'Cause, uh, you're from Scotland.
You know what happens, don't you?
The day Walter can't find what he's looking for?
You ever think that maybe that's why you and me were put with Walter?
To make sure that never happens?
We both owe the man our lives.
Then thy shall walk in thy way safely.

Okay, story so far:
clinically depressed, no girlfriend, weight issues, mucho health problems.
Recently sold all his belongings except for hundreds of man books.
Adventure, porn, crime, spy, or how to kill grizzly bears with a spoon?
Crime.
Except for one.
No pets, no friends, no computer.
No wonder he was depressed.
No, he was depressed because he was dying.
In the video, the guy's drunk, but this house is drier than Saudi Arabia.
So, bad guy bribes
Pudge to steal the map,
Pudge reads too many tough-guy books imagines himself a hard-boiled crook, shows up at the meet all whiskied up for courage without the map.
Demands more money, gets himself murdered.
Yup.
His place get tossed?
Nope.
Clean as a nun's closet.
Indicating Pudge told them where to find the map, most likely after torture.
Otherwise, his place would be upside down and inside out.
Who is this?
It's Dr. Brennan at the Jeffersonian.
Don't you have caller ID?
Caller ID doesn't tell you who's calling.
It tells you who the phone company wants you to think is calling.
Hey, did you guys find out that the victim was terminally ill?
Yes.
His mitral valve is completely calcified.
How did you know?
He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best.
Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in them.
So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Yes, I did.
Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death.
It's possible, given his heart condition, that the victim died with his secret intact.
No, he told the killer where to find the map.
Well, do you know where?
Poor man's safety deposit box.
I-I don't know what that means.
Pawnshop.
You got anything else?
No, I'm done.
Well, me, too.
For each person who goes in, three come out, and none of them is carrying merchandise.
Perfect setup for receiving stolen goods.
Frau Beckenbauer?
Guten Tag.
My name is Walter Sherman.
Oh, hello.
Ich do Frau Becken who was Temperance Brennan's...?
Hey, Ike, how do you say "foster parent" in German?
What makes you think you're speaking German?
Here in America, you are considering false redemption of a pawn ticket-- theft, identity theft.
Yeah, I'm a'risk it.
Das in seventh grade science metal den?
Impersonation with intent to defraud.
Thank you very much.
Totally understood me.
How strange that must be for you.
Tortious malfeasance.
I'm a'risk it.
I'd like to redeem this item.
Unless you issued a false ticket, it's a ukulele.
Although you spelled ukulele wrong-- too many E's and L's.
Unless....
Is that some kind of code?
Law says that for 60 days, I can only redeem the item to the pawner, Mr. Sam Nozik, which is exactly whom you are not.
We can get a warrant if that's the route you prefer.
Hmm.
Big ups for the Mod Squad impersonation, but no way you're cops.
Although, I'm always up for handcuffs.
You know what?
Come here.
What?
Recently, you had problems with the city, right?
Plumbing, health, vermin.
Ah!
Definite twitch on "vermin."
They shut us down for a whole week.
Right.
Cops did that so they could install surveillance.
Don't believe me, ask them.
Those cheating bastards.
Oh, that's a shame, right there.
What happened to it?
Girl smashed it to bits.
A girl?
I figured it was the guy's girlfriend.
Mad at him, right?
I give you this insight in a spirit of cooperation.
The girlfriend who smashed it-- what's her name?
Benjamin B. Benjamin.
$300?
That's one hell of a ukulele.
She maybe fished some piece of paper out of it before she vamoosed.
What else are you keeping from us?
Don't take that tone with the lovely lady.
What else do we have to give in exchange?
Right, well, what local cops like to do these days is they set up their own feed through your surveillance cameras.
I didn't get no name, but she had a tattoo across her chest.
"Do Not Resuscitate."
Walter, I told you when you found me a set of ivory irezumi tattoo needles from the Jomon period, anything you need, I'm your guy.
All I know, it's a girl.
"Do not resuscitate" across her chest.
Across her chest.
Daddy issues, self-loathing, possibly a lesbian.
What would be good is an actual name.
Anyone know an Ellen with "Do not resuscitate" inked across her boobs?
No, man.
I don't know nothing.
Why?
Spider indicates drugs, color blue means meth.
Hey, are you in charge of meth distribution in all of Southern Florida or just this county?
Leo?
Leo?
As a peaceful man, I'm going to ask you politely to please let my friend go.
Or what, you're gonna recite me a poem?
"Peace goes into the making of a poet as flour goes into the making of bread."
Who the hell is that?
Oh, that's my legal advisor.
Hmm.
Bartender's dealing Ecstasy, bikers get a cut of the pool tables, and they're running whores.
Yeah, I didn't bring you for your systems analysis.
Well, why did you bring me here?
Well, well.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Brittany Stephenson.
Looks like the biker didn't lie to Leo.
Yeah, well, people never lie to Leo.
So, I ask you, why did you bring me here?
Oh, Rusty says she's lesbian.
I just need you to distract her.
How?
Uh, buy her a drink.
Uh, something suggestive like a... ooh, a Slippery Nipple.
I am not lesbian.
I just have a confident "demeanior."
All right.
Oh.
Oy, oy, have a look.
Looks like Rusty got the ol' lesbian factor wrong.
Oh, this one's mine.
Okay, how's my breath?
She smuggles meth to bikers.
She tortured the fat man till he died.
She doesn't give a toss about your breath.
Ah, I'm a'risk it.
Okay, while I distract her, you break into her vehicle, and maybe we get lucky, find the stolen chart in the glove compartment.
Hey, you live on a boat?
You're like herpes-- impossible to get rid of.
The Screw You?
My motto.
Take it personal.
Okay, so, a tattoo:
Do Not Resuscitate, a boat:
Screw You.
I got concerns about your self-esteem.
Do you have any idea of the black market in organs?
That tattoo is like an open invitation to wake up in a bathtub, packed full of ice, no kidneys.
I'll look out for my organs, you look out for yours.
Are we alone?
How do you mean?
I mean, is someone watching us?
You've got some kind of mental problems, am I right?
Well, two tours in Iraq left me a little suspicious, but otherwise,
I am a fully functioning male machine.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.
Tide's shifting now, so...
What is that?
I don't know.
Some kind of a telescope.
It belongs to a client.
Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."
When can I see you again?
Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.
Nobody will.
Because I'll be gone.
I could find you.
In my experience, men don't try that hard.
I'm like a whole new experience.
Once I start looking for you, I will find you.
Why are you being so persistent?
I'm not that pretty.
Well, that's crazy.
You're beautiful.
That's a good-bye kiss, all right?
Well, are you sure you don't want me to come with you now, just to be safe?
Now, Walter, who the hell ever got anything worth getting by being safe?
The chart fragment's got to be on that boat.
I octopused her.
I couldn't find the map anywhere on her person.
How about you?
Nothing in her truck.
Not even a VIN number.
Ah, chop shop vehicle.
All stolen bits and pieces?
Mm-hmm.
Nice girl.
Yeah, a girl who kisses a guy to make him go away.
That's a nice form of rejection.
Seriously, Walter?
Can you imagine how blokes she's driven away with that mouth?
Britanny's got the original chart.
We'll get the next best thing.
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Sherman.
What's this?
As promised.
You-you did it.
That's, uh...
I was going to say "impossible," but clearly, it's not impossible, but...
I-I...
I lost this.
Are you impressed?
I'd like to impress you.
Why?
The usual reasons.
This...
This is me and... my mom.
I...
I'm ex... extremely grateful.
It's amazing how many times people ask me to find something, but the real treasure's something else altogether.
Did you come all this way just to bring me this?
Yes.
And to ask if you got somebody in this lab who can recreate the missing chart fragment from the museum's security footage.
Yes, yes, I, um...
Angela Montenegro has been... working on that.
I will take you to her to her office.
It's, um...
The security footage includes several dozen frames from slightly different angles, so... we should be able to get a pretty good image.
How accurate will this be?
100%.
Who are you?
I'm her husband.
Huh.
Are you rich?
Okay, where did that come from?
On a scale of one to ten, she's an 11.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Yeah, you're a seven.
So if you're rich it just explains the discrepancy.
Really.
Boys, the navigator's name was Absalon Fidalgo.
You know, this looks faint, but it looks as though this is the location where he abandoned ship.
Impossible.
That-that'll put it northwest of the Campeche Bank.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Now that is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ and his representative on Earth, the Pope.
Which puts the prime meridian in Rome, not Greenwich, England.
And that pulls the shipwreck way over toward Key West.
You pretty confident of your arithmetic?
I did it by pen, pencil, abacus and calculator.
Leo did it in his head.
It's correct.
Then we are here.
Maybe when I'm down there, you two keep an eye out.
For Brittany?
More concerned about who she's working for.
Would you get a grip.
You're in denial that she tortured Pudge to death.
There was a sextant on her boat.
She thought it was some kind of telescope for a client.
Now, he was probably below decks which is why she wouldn't let me on board.
That... is our bad guy.
Very plausible interpretation.
Yeah,
I'm sure she's the nice kind of meth smuggler.
Got anything?
Naw.
You got anything going on up there?
Oil tanker maybe ten miles east.
You might want to rethink your maths.
Do you see anything?
Yeah.
LEO What did you find, Walter?
What do you got, amberjacks?
Not aberjacks.
Brittany.
Britanny Stephenson.
I suspect drowning.
That is a good guess since Walter here found her at the bottom of the ocean.
Really?
Sarcasm?
Because this body shouldn't even be here.
It should be on a coroner's lab in Miami.
I'm working for the Feds.
This is a federal institution.
Who are you working for?
Me.
No.
Not.
That's not true.
In Cam's defense, there's no singular autopsy finding pathognomonic of drowning.
Ooh!
Ooh, what?
You find something?
What is that?
Well, it was in too far for her to have swallowed it on her own.
My guess is that her accomplice goes diving with her.
There's no treasure.
He gets angry, and blames Brittany, realizing that she's the only witness to the murder of Sam Nozik.
Rips off her regulator and jams that down her throat.
Wait a second.
Is that blood?
Yeah.
I don't think it's all hers.
Enough for DNA?
If our killer's in the database.
Whoa...
More than enough.
She bit the attacker's finger off.
Unfortunately...
Wow.
digestive fluids degraded the fingerprints.
Di-Don't touch that, Wally.
That's evidence.
Please, come on.
This is the original stolen chart fragment.
My work's done.
What's this?
Itemized invoice for my expenses-- mostly fuel for Ike flying me back and forth.
But we haven't solved the murder.
Yeah, two murders.
Two murders.
We haven't solved two murders.
You hired me to find the missing chart fragment.
Eureka, ta-da, bingo.
Mission accomplished.
I found it.
Uh, technically, I found it;
in her throat.
Brittany's body was submerged under 80 feet of water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
I brought her here to you.
I'm pretty sure that's the impressive part.
That's true.
If it weren't for Walter, her remains would never have been discovered.
Seriously.
Before I tell you what I know,
I want you to promise me the Church will get the treasure.
You got a de, Eddie.
Please... address me as "Excellency."
I'm a bishop.
Bishop-smishop.
We're here because you're an expert on Vatican treasure ships.
Ironic, isn't it?
He helped me find my faith when I lost it;
now my faith is the thing about me he likes least.
Where exactly did the three nails appear?
Here.
Seguid vuestro jefe:
"Follow your leader."
Right after the chart was soaked in blood.
But that shouldn't bother you, Eddie.
You drink a goblet of the stuff every day when you give communion.
Why is Walter angry at God this time?
The blood belongs to a girl.
Not just a girl.
A girl-girl.
And Walter intends to find her killer.
I'm sorry, Walter.
She'll be in my prayers.
Yeah.
Your navigator had a secret so he used a special ink which would only appear when exposed to breast milk, semen or blood.
Was he a Freemason or something?
Worse.
Three nails means he was a Jesuit.
Mmm.
Jesuits are Catholic.
You are a Jesuit...
Excellency.
At the time of the sinking of the Santa Esperanza, the Jesuits had been abolished by Pope Clement.
And why should that make a difference?
A Protestant measures from the Greenwich Observatory in England;
a Catholic, from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
What about a closet Jesuit?
From the Copernican Observatory on Monte Mario.
Thanks, Bish.
Walter, please sit.
I owe you my immortal soul.
I wish to discuss the brain damage you suffered in Iraq.
I'm gone.
Don't bless me;
I hate that.
You know, you really should've broached the subject of his mental health before you told him what he needed to know.
Is that decaf?
Decaf's what you ordered, isn't it?
I didn't ask what I ordered.
I asked what you brought me.
Don't punish her because you're mad at Ike and Eddie and God and yourself.
Tell him it's decaf.
It's decaf.
Hey.
Why doesn't a cup of decaf cost more than a cup of normal coffee?
Why should it?
Well, it goes through the whole extra process to remove the caffeine, right?
So, why doesn't it cost more?
What's the coffee industry up to?
People don't like to pay more for something that's had something removed.
It's human psychology.
It's the coffee thing?
Show him the pot.
See?
Orange.
Orange is for decaf.
Oh, yeah?
Who came up with that rule?
Walter's upset that you and Eddie ganged up on him.
No.
Where friends conspire to help someone they love, it isn't really conspiracy, is it?
You know, we-we don't understand why you choose to remain handicapped.
How is he handicapped?
He can find anything.
And he's so paranoid he can't enjoy a simple cup of coffee.
How is it paranoia when my best friends are actually conspiring behind my back.
I'm not in this.
My people believe that gifted individuals, like Walter, hear Akashwani, or "a voice from the sky."
You think if you get treatment for your brain damage, you lose your finding mojo.
It's just nuts.
No, it's not nuts, Ike.
It's true.
Okay.
There is an infinite, thrumming, unseen web that joins everything.
Everything is connected to everything else.
I mean, this fact is nearly impossible for us to grasp because we are just mollusks, shut up tight at the bottom of a dark, cold ocean, trying to make sense of stars we cannot even see.
I challenge everything, because when I do, a quick bolt of electricity jolts between two elements that otherwise appeared unconnected.
You call it paranoia:
I call it epiphany.
You want me to give that up, so I can enjoy a cup of decaf coffee?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
"Take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind."
What?
Wha-wha-what does that mean, Leo?
Huh?
What the hell are you two talking about?
Come on, Ike.
I'll be fine.
Just so long as the world is full of lost things that need to be found.
You do know that the only infinite, thrumming web is right in here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry; my mistake.
It wasn't decaf.
I'm going to bring you a new pot.
Wow.
Every single time.
Akashwani.
Booth?
Dr. Hodgins has something very important to tell you.
What?
There are three nails on the chart.
Here.
See?
Clear as day.
So?
The three nails were purposely rendered in a kind of invisible ink.
It reacts to blood, semen, breast milk...
Let's just get to the important part and then we'll back to the boring stuff.
If you want... we can figure out where to find that treasure.
Since the dawn of navigation, latitude has never changed.
Everyone was always in agreement.
The equator is zero degrees;
no question:
no debate.
But not longitude.
Now we all agree that the Greenwich Observatory is zero degrees longitude.
But back in the olden days, there were hundreds of prime meridians, all of them completely arbitrary.
Where did the ship go down?
The navigator of the Santa Esperanza didn't base his calculations on St. Peter's Basilica?
No.
Because if he had, the treasure would be exactly where Walter Sherman found that girl's body.
Now, the navigator of the Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.
Since this is where Fidalgo studied,
I'd put my money on the Copernican Observatory.
Look at that.
I tell you, they're pretty close together.
But at the bottom of the ocean, you might as well be a hundred miles apart.
Do you think that Walter found this out?
I don't know how he could have.
He did.
He's got the finder power.
Is that real?
Yes, it's real.
God, I hate that son of a bitch.
Santa Esperanza went down right here.
These are the exact coordinates.
Have you verified the location of the wreck?
Once we realized the navigator was Jesuit, it was child's play.
Oh... my God.
It's genuine, 17th century
Madonna della Strada.
It's from the Santa Esperanza.
I'm astounded.
My gift from me to you.
Oh...
I apologize.
Jesuit, you say?
The navigator was a secret Jesuit.
What led you to that conclusion?
Blood on the chart revealed a secret sign.
Blood?
Your blood, to be precise.
The injured hand, in and of itself, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonable doubt.
I saw a 300-year-old sextant on Brittany's boat.
Where else could that have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.
What do you want?
Uh, you must feel terrible.
Just a slight mathematical adjustment, you could have had it all to yourself.
You're not the police.
So, what do you want?
What do I want?
Yeah.
I want Brittany Stephenson not to be dead.
Ike advised me to kill him.
Discussing murder not only makes it conspiracy but confirms premeditation.
I advise against homicide.
Mmm, I'm a'risk it.
Walter...
I'll be grievously offended if you kill him with Our Blessed Mother.
Ah...
I'd never risk that, Leo.
Maybe I could just arrest him for, uh, for stealing that treasure.
How is finding a treasure "stealing"?
He was working for the FBI-- right?
-- when he found that treasure.
And he can't just keep it.
Oh...
Why do you dislike Walter so much?
Okay, look.
Rebecca was in labor with Parker.
I wanted to be there for the birth of my son.
Right?
Right.
So I can't get a pass.
So I go AWOL.
So what happens?
Military Police sends Walter after me, to find me.
I'm standing there, holding my newborn son, and in comes the finder, and he handcuffs me right there.
That was his job.
His job?
Sometimes... you know, in this line of work, as a human being, you just have to look the other way.
This is my chance to get a little payback, that's all.
Whoa.
Oy!
G-man, Skeleton-Babe.
We've been looking all over town for you.
Okay.
Is this the treasure?
Yeah, it better be.
Better be?
Yeah, because if it's not,
I'm going to arrest Walter.
Is he in there?
Which is why Walter decided to skip this little meeting.
Arrest him on what charge?
Booth says that
Walter found the treasure while under contract to the FBI, so he can't keep it.
Legally speaking, and acting upon my advice,
Mr. Sherman had already quit his consultant's position at the Bureau at the time he located the Santa Esperanza.
That's true.
What?
He presented us with a bill.
Good one.
Don't sound impressed.
- That's not...
- No.
We reported the location of the treasure to the original owners.
What, the Roman Catholic Church?
Yeah, that's right.
Take it up with them.
Booth.
This isn't the treasure.
There's a human being in here.
Oy, oy, Leo, off we go then.
All righty.
Whoa, whoa!
No-no-no-no.
No, no.
You kidnapped somebody?
There's a fine line between kidnapping and citizen's arrest.
I'm signaling my intention to pull out into traffic now.
No you're not, 'cause if you do,
I'll add "fleeing the scene" to my list of charges.
I'm sure you'll find that Walter exceeded the terms of your contract.
Booth, you said that sometimes we look the other way.
Lambert Chaisson.
Hey, Buddy.
Got an extra finger.
You want to try it on?
"Drowned Kitten versus Fat Girl Smoking."
That depends on if you like cats.
Are we discussing which is sadder or which is more depressing?
Same thing.
No.
Depressing is a matter of personal taste, whereas sad is universal.
Drowned kitten is sadder.
Fat girl smoking is more depressing.
Walter?
He's thinking about the bone lady.
"Op-ti-mi-tist..."
"...versus Fool."
Optimist, without a doubt.
Fool, without a doubt.
I can't be the sole individual who's noticed the only thing
Walter can't find...
is lasting love.
Until now.
Because the bones lady could be the one.
Told you, Bones.
Finder power.
There's a rational explanation for his abilities.
It's not magic.
Maybe not.
But it sure is magicky.
What do you call my amazing abilities, behind my back?
Yours would be a rigorous application of training with an intense attention to detail.
Cheers.
I think Walter did look the other way, the day that Parker was born.
Seriously?
Looked the other way?
He handcuffed me in front of my newborn son.
A newborn can see, at best, only between eight and 15 inches.
Parker probably wouldn't remember anyway, but more importantly,
Walter waited until after you had a chance to hold your newborn before he arrested you.
You know, I don't like the son of a bitch.
And you-- there you go-- and you can't make me.
Cheers to that.
Fair enough.
Right?
Got your medal back.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Hey, where are we?
Nowhere.
This place doesn't have a name.
Isn't that inconvenient?
If necessary, you may simply call it by any name you wish.
One person called this the Labyrinth Library.
Any other names?
Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian.
Don't you get lonely out here?
Six months have passed since I received a letter informing me of my grandfather's death.
He'd been shot by a burglar who'd broken into the house.
A somewhat peculiar way to die for a man with an earldom to his name.
Though some found it rather fitting.
My grandfather was a collector of rare books.
He was what you might call a bibliomaniac.
His obsession with books was so intense he once spent half of his wealth on a single rare book.
His behavior caused the family to despise, shun, and fear him.
Well, they were actually more afraid of his collection of books.
They believed that among his library were dark and accursed books which granted knowledge of the forbidden.
I must admit that I wasn't particularly intimate with him.
Quite frankly, I was surprised when I received this letter.
But I was also grateful.
For it filled me with hope.
A faint hope that I would finally find what I had long been searching for...
Guess not.
What is the meaning of this?
All the books in the mansion are collected here?
A doll?
Why is it here...
Who are you?
Forgive me.
My name is Hugh Anthony Disward.
You can call me Huey.
I am the grandson of Wesley Disward, the former owner of this house.
Wes's?
You knew my grandfather?
Why would Wes's grandson come here now?
I'm looking for something.
Looking for something?
Perhaps you know something about the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian.
How do you know that name...?
It was in my grandfather's will.
To inherit this mansion and all it contains,
I must take over responsibility for the Bibliotheca.
There was also one other part that concerned me.
Here, you see where he says to look after Dalian for him?
He's probably referring to a pet of some kind...
P-Pet?
!
The poor thing...
It must be starving.
And I'll need to clean up any mess it's made.
Why you stupid grandson!
Ouch...
Dalian happens to be my name!
Episode 1 "Turn-up Book"
You were a soldier?
No, just a pilot.
Anyway, just so we're clear.
Dalian, were you truly a friend of my grandfather's?
Yes, he was a fine human.
I see...
So he wasn't completely alone.
Where is the sugar?
Oh, you take sugar with your tea?
The sugar is not for my tea, you dunce.
It is a long-standing custom to sprinkle sugar on buns.
Just so you know, that's my lunch you're eating.
I recall that you were expressing concern about how Dalian must be starving.
That's true...
Feel free to call me Huey.
Dantalian is the name of a demon.
The demon of knowledge, who holds countless books.
The idea of a library that bears his name sounded promising at first...
So you were disappointed?
There was nothing remarkable about the books in the cellar.
Certainly, there were many volumes that would fetch a high price, but they are still nothing more than books.
The collection wasn't worthy of having a demon as a namesake.
You have an eye for books, as Wes's grandson should.
But...
You know nothing at all.
What do you mean?
Have you heard of The World in The Gourd?
The World in the Gourd?
I believe that it's an ancient tale from the Far East about a man who wandered into a gourd and discovered a new world.
You are more knowledgeable than I would have expected.
I commend you.
Thanks awfully.
So why did you mention that story?
If a gourd is capable of housing a completely different world, could the same not apply to a library of infinite knowledge?
A library with the all the knowledge of demons...
And that would be the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian?
That's a fascinating story.
My grandfather was a sucker for fairy tales.
Imbecile!
I was a fool to place my hopes in you.
An utter fool...
Where did you find that key?
You recognize it?
Don't worry.
I assume that my escort has arrived.
I must express my gratitude for accepting the invitation of my master, Mr. Henry Conrad, despite how tired you must be from your long journey, Lord Disward.
I must also show my appreciation to Mr. Conrad for allowing a visit on such short notice.
I am coming with you.
Dalian?
!
I am coming with you to Conrad's house.
What are you planning?
I would ask you the same question.
Conrad is the man who killed Wes.
You're saying that he disguised himself as a burglar to steal one of my grandfather's books.
You knew?
I've heard rumors.
The rivalry between my grandfather and Mr. Conrad was rather notorious.
But there is no proof.
So I plan to snoop around.
There is proof.
The moon is full tonight.
If Conrad truly stole that book, he is about to see that which should never be seen.
Our guests have arrived!
Is anyone here?
!
I am very sorry.
Please wait one moment.
Yes...
It may be too late.
Dalian!
This is..
We must find his study.
The origin of this aberration will most likely be found in Conrad's study.
What do you mean?
Up ahead!
You carry dangerous weapons on your person?
You intended to avenge Wes with that gun?
I have no reason to avenge him.
This is a good-luck charm of sorts.
It appears that Conrad was the one who took that book.
It looks like a elephant barreled through this room.
Yes, so it would seem.
So it would seem...?
There aren't any elephants around here.
You were the one who mentioned them.
Besides...
Elephants are not the only creatures we have to worry about.
What's going on?
A knife thrower, an elephant, now a lion...
There may also be a giant snake and clown lurking around.
That would make this...
Yes, a circus.
Have you heard of the Harlequinade?
Harlequinade...?
As in a turn-up book.
Did you ever read one as a child?
I owned a few pop-up books...
Wait, how is this relevant?
I am giving you an explanation of the Phantom Book Conrad took.
Phantom Book?
Look.
This is the true identity of the lion you killed.
Paint?
There are mystical books in this world that were never meant to exist.
Phantom books?
If the reader is able to comprehend the Phantom Book, he will receive immeasurable blessings.
However, in the hands of someone who is unfit, the book will cross into this world breaking down the laws of reason and causality.
Because of the danger they pose, the Phantom Books are sealed by the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian.
Yes.
Wes learned of the Harlequinade and the curse it brought upon its owner, so he tried to seal it away.
However...
Conrad stole the book.
The magic in Phantom Books waxes and wanes with the moon.
An illegitimate reader like Conrad could never control such power.
It appears that I don't have time to be skeptical.
The study is probably back there.
Why is that thing here!
?
Did you not know?
Freak shows are standard fare for circuses.
And the star of the show is always, most decidedly, a dragon.
You might want to mention how those are always fake.
There is nothing surprising about finding a real dragon inside a picture book.
We have been cornered.
So it would seem.
Dalian, how fast can you run?
What do you mean?
I'll draw its attention away.
Use that chance to run to the study...
You intend to act as a decoy?
!
You know how to seal Phantom Books, right?
Noblesse oblige is pure bullshit, as far as I'm concerned, but if my grandfather's book is responsible for this mess,
I have to do something.
And we can't allow that monster to get outside.
Take out the key, human.
Dalian...?
Hugh Anthony Disward!
I acknowledge you as my Keykeeper!
If you are truly worthy of the position, read aloud the pledge.
The pledge...?
I ask of thee...
Art thou mankind?
Nay, I am the world.
The world inside the gourd.
Labyrinth of bookcases, warden of 900,000 and 666 sealed Phantom Books...
Open the gates to wisdom!
Liber de Nymphis, authored by the alchemist Paracelsus.
A Phantom Book which was never meant to exist in this world.
A genuine grimoire.
Now read the book!
Sheol.
A dark and silent abyss where the souls of the dead wander.
My foray into the abyss began with the innocence of a child chasing after a butterfly.
Eternal pain.
Each breath brings with it smothering despair.
What words might I offer if I were to come across my mother and father?
So long it has been since I bound across the earth, amassing a wealth of knowledge.
The intellect of a demon.
The ultimate equation which barred my path.
And the solution.
I continued to search.
For a simple and universal answer.
Joy.
The joy of life.
The consummate joy of man that shall never fade.
However, the irregular wingbeats of the butterfly give rise to an infinite array of realities.
The laws of life sneer at human wisdom, and escape from our grasp.
Crises of all kinds are averted, yet poverty never goes away.
Humans devour each other, succumb to disease, and cry out in agony as they die.
Oh, Sheol.
Merciless god of the underworld.
Death incarnate.
Hear my voice!
Hear the grievous sobs of a mourning child!
The carcass of the butterfly you have ensnared may pale or tear apart, yet still, there are those who would defy death for a single scale.
Behold!
As the ferocious worms take flight into the sky again.
Crushed dreams...
Lingering rays of sunset transformed into brilliant light...
Curl your lips into a smile.
Spread your wings with fervor!
Take flight!
Butterfly of despair!
Come, Huey.
It is time for us to seal Conrad's Phantom Book.
Together.
You're right.
Turn-up books first appeared in the middle of the 18th century.
Some say that Robert Sayer's Harlequin Turn-Ups were the very first.
However, judging from the printing, this book is early 18th century.
It is entirely possible that the first turn-up book was trying to imitate this.
A literal pop-up book, huh...
Books and humans are drawn to one another.
In the right hands, a Phantom Book can function as an ordinary book.
But Mr. Conrad's foolish pride led him to a gruesome end.
Some things are not meant to be known.
So you were the world in the gourd Dalian.
Phantom Books, huh?
My grandfather left me an inheritance that's out of this world.
I am hungry.
I said that I am hungry, Huey.
Right.
First, we'll need to find a carriage.
It'll be morning by the time we get home.
I'll have to prepare some sugar-coated buns for breakfast.
I suppose that I will have to accompany you.
To Be Continued
Humans like you make me sick, Huey.
I was a fool to acknowledge you as my keeper.
Wh-What's got you so upset, Dalian?
Men will allow themselves to be tricked by any woman who pays the slightest attention to them.
Episode 2: "Book of Fetus"
Next time:
Book of Fetus.
I got it, I got it.
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
Bzzz.
Morning.
Hey, buddy.
Ready to get your rocks on?
See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for "strip club." Huh?
Yeah.
You got your singles?
Heh, heh.
Got it?
Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
- Got it.
I got it.
- I'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.
Ha-ha.
Here's just hoping we get something good.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
Get the bad guy.
Yeah!
♪ 'Cause it's the eye of the tiger It's the thrill of the fight ♪
♪ Rising up ♪♪
But-
- But-- What are you doing, buddy?
Leaving.
You gotta go inside, order something like last time.
Avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby, let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
Bump, bump, bump. bump, bump.
That's work.
That's home.
That's work, that's home.
What, this guy, he goes two places every day, all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that maybe, just maybe, he's not your guy?
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place and I want to report a very suspicious man lurking in my neighborhood.
He's sitting in a blue sedan, and he's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
I guess we'd better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey, uh...
Got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
Hmm.
So, what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home.
Watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know, stuff.
Well, like what?
Like, uh, Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
Hmm.
Heh.
I am gonna do it.
You gotta inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man?
Don't you have enough cancer already?
Look.
I said
I'd do it. I'll do it.
Yeah, well, what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Am I catching you at a bad time?
No.
I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone doesn't want a big birthday, just wants to hang out with friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured a low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet, and buy him a car.
Used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
Or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
You just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking, maybe, you don't need to even work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close.
Give us another month or two and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say, maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Hello?
Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank.
I'm up.
Oh, good, uh...
What you doing?
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favor to ask.
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns 1 3 other restaurants.
Right?
So I start thinking about this little empire of his.
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging, and bingo.
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean,
I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings, or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Heh-heh.
Uh...
You know, Hank, I'm-
- I'm-- l'm--
I mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm--
You know, I won't lie.
Um...
You've caught me somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking-a-dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's embarrassing.
That's it.
Um--
You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything--
Yeah.
It's out of control.
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex at the mall.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
You don't have to paint a picture.
One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride.
Uh...
Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh--
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Well, look, I'm-- This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours at the most.
And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two?
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I, uh...
You know, I just-- I would just really love to be the one to be able to take you there.
And, I mean, I've just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you and helping you and-- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Ha-ha.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it.
Thank you. I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike, listen.
I just want to say first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law, my DE-
- He...
Soon, he will probably, in the near future, take a ride out to a certain distribution center to look around for things.
Just... look around for things.
And, yeah.
Uh...
Mike?
Where's this all going?
Elsewhere.
Thank you.

Okay, great.
Please give this to your car-care professional.

Oh, and SUV's are extra.
And please give this to your car-care professional.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you, uh...?
Someone from the office, uh, said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.
Wow.
Well, uh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha.
You look great.
No.
No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you, um...
Hi, there.
Um, I guess, Skyler, um,
I'm gonna need to talk to you.
Uh, Ted, I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Um, a while.
I debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?
Ted, this is...
This is the CID.
The criminal division.
My God, you're facing a felony charge here.
A $1 00,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe, plus five years in prison.
Yeah.
Ahem.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe, if you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use--
Ted, it doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay?
Once the cid sees this is willful tax fraud, they will build the strongest possible case against you.
Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail, and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted, everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry. I, uh...
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
Okay?
Here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent poking around your junk.
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
But killing a cop,
I don't know.
It could look suspicious if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-
- There's Mr. White, who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch.
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
Hey.
Get down!
Tell them the answer is "yes."
Should I even ask?
I wouldn't.
So, what?
ls this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
Yo.
Like, um...
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.
But seriously, what--?
What was the deal with Gus?
The deal?
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But, what?
The rest of us are like open season?
Is he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out for target practice while he--?
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry l am late.
I got lost.
Hey, Ted.
Sky.
Whoo.
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are...?
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh. "Special." Skyler White.
Ms. White, you are the accountant of record for many of these reports, is that correct?
Guilty as charged.
Can you shed light on this history of missing revenue?
Missing?
No, it's there.
Mm-hm.
No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company, but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh.
Mm.
Let's take a look.
Mm.
Oh, well, you know, this account here, that is Mr. Keller's account.
And Mr. Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
He always sends an electronic payment, which I hate, because I'm a real-paper person.
Mr. Keller is one of those environmental people.
Since there wasn't a physical check,
I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
Well, I think I am.
No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
It doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check, income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
Mm-hm.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
Ms. White, how did you get this job?
Ted hired me.
No, I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Ooh.
Well, I haven't had any training, per se.
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Uh...
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
- What happened was good news.
- Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $61 7,000.
What am l--?
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage--
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.
Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation, and that little fiction I just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah, I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday, to my man at the farm, it was a terrible thing.
The dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I've invited you into my home, prepared food so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that is happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first,
I need you to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce his product without any help?
Alone.
No.
Why?
You're asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago.
This your plan?
Huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy, and make me feel important.
Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White?
You wanna-- You wanna talk like men?
Let's talk like men.
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
Hey, you headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White, hey.
I really gotta talk to you. I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You-
- You want a beer or something?
No.
Should I sit down?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, go ahead.
Okay, so, um...
Okay, so word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some-- Some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down"?
The cartel has been-- Has been messing with Gus' operation.
Like jacking trucks to, like, send a message.
And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off.
But between the cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.
So, Gus is-
- Is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you, so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man, you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to--
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever, and they got like actual chemists, like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you.
And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English?
You know?
I don't know.
Ugh.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up,
I'm dead, you know?
All of us.
Mr. White, look, I need-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could-- Maybe you could coach me or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.
Mr. White?
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
"Passed down." By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
I mean, they did.
They-- So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you--?
You weren't at Gus' house last night.
What?
What the hell?
Jesus.
Still here.
It's still here.
Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?
Okay?
I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
What was I supposed to do, poison myself?
Two hours, 1 8 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?
He never left the room.
You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do, one thing.
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives, and you were right there.
You were in his house, and you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 1 8 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:1 0 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 1 8 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you.
Ugh!
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry, after everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You killed me, is what you've done!
You've signed my death warrant!
Now you want advice?
I'll give you advice:
Go to Mexico and screw up like I know you will.
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!
Argh!
You son of a--
Can you walk?
Yeah.
Then get the fuck out of here and never come back.
Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad...
We're talking nearly a million dollars of undocummented revenue.
Don't report this.
I'll do it.
I'll kill him.
Stick this on the car and see where it goes.
Do it.
If something were to happen to Hank then that would only draw their attention to you.
I will make sure that he discovers nothing.
[heavy breathing]
[gasping]
I got it, I got it.
Just--
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
Bzzz.
Good morning.
Hey, buddy.
Ready to get your rocks on?
See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for strip club.
Hey, you got any singles?
[chuckling]
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
Got it.
I got it.
I'm sorry.
[grunt]
[Hank] Christ.
Longest week ever.
[chuckling]
I just hope we get something good, you know?
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.

Leaving.
No, you got to go inside and order something like last time to avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.
That's work, that's home, that's work, that's home.
What, this guy goes two places every day all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that... maybe, just maybe... he's not your guy?
Oh, a guy this clean's got to be dirty.
[sigh]
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place, and I want to report a very suspicious man who's lurking in my neighborhood.
He's sitting in a blue Sedan, and he-
- He's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
So I guess we better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey, uh...
You got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
Like, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
[coughing]
Hmm.
So what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home, watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Like what?
Like, uh...
Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.
You got to inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man, don't you have enough cancer already?
Look, I said...
I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well, what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
[adding machine clicks]
[Walt] Hi.
Hi.
Am I, uh, catching you at a bad time?
No, I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone doesn't want a big thing for his birthday.
He just wants to hang out with his friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured, uh, low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet and... buy him a car--
Uh, used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Air bags, safety rated, all that.
Do you, um, have any thoughts on what kind, or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
No, you just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen.
On another subject,
I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking maybe... you don't even need to work your second job.
You're turning a profit?

Hello.
Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank, I'm up.
Oh, good.
Uh, what you doing?
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I-I'll cut to it.
I got another favor to ask.
I've been thinking about this Gus Fring, right?
How he never goes anywhere, one restaurant, home, one restaurant, home, back and forth back and forth?
Which, now I'm even more convinced is bullshit, because the man owns
13 other restaurants, right?
So I started thinking about this little empire of his, right?
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging', and bingo!
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
Uh...
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean--
I'm looking at it online right now.
I tell you, it's a big warehouse and rows of these long poultry buildings, or hatcheries, or whatever you call 'em.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So.
Whaddya say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Uhh...
You know, Hank.
Um...
I mean, it sounds great.
It really does.
But I--
You know, I won't lie, uh--
You caught me...
somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking a dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's--
Embarrassingly, that's it.
You know, it's just... upset stomach, you know, and everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
Really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex.
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint me a picture.
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride for this one.
[grunts] Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Look, I'm-
- I'm--
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.
And, um...
Do you think you could possibly hold off for a day or two?
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-
- You know--
You know, I just--
I would just really... love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and--
I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you,
- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
[chuckles]
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it, all right?
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.

Listen.
I just want to say, first off, don't be angry.

Hey, Sky.

I really need to talk to you.
Ted,
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.

Wait, an audit tomorrow?

I'd... debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?

Everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you-- you--
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I, uh,
I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.
Somehow.
Okay?
[door closes]
Here.
[Jesse] Right here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent, poking' around your junk--
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him... for good.
But killing a cop--
I don't know.
It could look suspicious if, uh, the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White.
Who'd be even more ape shit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to the man, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
[silenced gunshot]
[sniper rifle's report]
[silence, wind rushing]
[rifle shot]
- [rifle shot]
- Son of a bitch!
[rifle shot]
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
[rifle shot]
[rifle shot]
- Hey.
- Get down!
[chuckles]
[phone rings] [ring]
[ring]
[ring] [ring]
[ring] [ring]
Sí.
[speaking Spanish]
[buzzer sounds]
[buzzer] [lock snaps open]
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus just need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
[Mike's footsteps]
Yo, like, uh,
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time, don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet, run and so forth.
But seriously, what--
What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?
Walking right into the bullets?
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But what?
The rest of us are like, open season?
Is he doing anything about that?
Or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while he's--
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
Do you want to say something about this?
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
Well, I-
- I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
[door opens]
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.
Whoo!
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are--
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh.
Special.
Skyler White.
Ms. White.
You are the accountant of record for many of these reports.
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
Well then, perhaps you can shed some light on this history of missing revenue.
Missing?
Uh-huh.
- No, it's there.
- No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.
But it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh!
Hmm, let's take a look.
Hmm.
Oh.
Well, you know, this account here?
That is Mr. Keller's account, and Mr. Keller's an old friend of Ted's dad, and he always sends an electronic payment, which personally I hate, because I'm a real paper person, but Mr. Keller's one of those environmental people.
So anyway, since there wasn't a physical check,
I didn't enter it into the book, but... the money's there.
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I... did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.
No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
[laughs]
But seriously, I am.
Look, it doesn't matter if its an electronic check or a paper check, income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
Uh-huh.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Oh, do you guys use that here?
'Cause it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
Ms. White, how did you get this job?
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.
I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Ooh, well I haven't had any training per se,
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
[sighs]
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened is good news.
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Look, pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.
All right?
You just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage on your house.
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets
- left to sell.
- Ted.
If you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation.
And that little fiction I just spun up there will completely unravel.
You have to settle.
[car beeps] Wish I could.
[doorbell rings]
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah.
I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
[knife cutting on wood]
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.
[cutting continues]
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday to my man at the farm--
It was a terrible thing.
Oh, the dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I have invited you into my home, prepared food, so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that's happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first, I need you... to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce this product?
Without any help, alone?
No.
Why?
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago?
This is your plan, huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy and-- And make me feel important, then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White.
You want to-
- You want to talk like men?
Let's talk like men!
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
[door opens]
[closes]
[Skyler breathing]
Hey, you, uh-- You headed out?
Yeah.
[Jesse] Yo, Mr. White.
Hey, uh,
I really got to talk to you.
I-
- I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You uh-- You want a beer?
- Or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.
Okay, so, um--
Okay.
So... word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down?"
Yeah, the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation.
Like jacking trucks to like, send a message, and you know, yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab?
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off, but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like, what do you call, a rock and a hard place situation.
So Gus is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula, and he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, Gus doesn't trust you, so...
I gotta go-
- I mean, you're the chemist, man!
You know, not me.
Let's say I go down to, you know, go over there, go to the jungle or-
- Or whatever.
You know, and say they got, like, actual chemists, like cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you?
And what if, like, all the equipment is uh, is in Mexican, instead of English?
You know?
Oh!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up,
I am dead, you know?
All of us!
So I-
- Look, I-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could, like, coach me or something, you know?
Or you can give me some notes.
Mr. White.
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
Passed down?
By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
They did.
They--
So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you...
You weren't at Gus's house last night.
What?
What the hell?
J-Jesus--
It's still here.
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance.
All right?
Okay, I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me--
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay?
He just made this one big pot, and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do?
Huh?
Poison myself?
Two hours and 18 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do!
One thing!
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives.
Right there.
You were in his house!
And you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes, but you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you--
[Scoffing] You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry.
After everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You've killed me is what you've done.
You've signed my death warrant.
And now you want advice?
All right, I'll give you advice.
Go to Mexico and screw up, like I know you will, and wind up in a barrel somewhere!
[growling, grunting]
[gasping, wheezing] [yelling]
Oh, God!
[sighing, gasping]
[coughing]
Can you walk?
Yeah.
You get the fuck out of here and never come back.
Ohh!
[groan]
I got it, I got it.
Just--
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
Bzzz.
Good morning.
Hey, buddy.
Ready to get your rocks on?
See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for strip club.
Hey, you got any singles?
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
Got it.
I got it.
I'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.
I just hope we get something good, you know?
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
♪ Chk-a bom bom bom♪
♪ Bom, chka-chka-chka-chka, bom bom bom♪
Get the bad guy!
♪ It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight♪
♪ Risin' up to keep 'em alive♪
Uhh!
What-
- What-
- But-
- But-- What are you doing, buddy?
Leaving.
No, you got to go inside and order something like last time to avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.
That's work, that's home, that's work, that's home.
What, this guy goes two places every day all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that... maybe, just maybe... he's not your guy?
Oh, a guy this clean's got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place, and I want to report a very suspicious man who's lurking in my neighborhood.
He's sitting in a blue Sedan, and he-
- He's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
So I guess we better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey, uh...
You got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
Like, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
Hmm.
So what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home, watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Like what?
Like, uh...
Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.
You got to inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man, don't you have enough cancer already?
Look, I said...
I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well, what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
Hi.
Hi.
Am I, uh, catching you at a bad time?
No, I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone doesn't want a big thing for his birthday.
He just wants to hang out with his friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured, uh, low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet and... buy him a car--
Uh, used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Air bags, safety rated, all that.
Do you, um, have any thoughts on what kind, or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
No, you just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen.
On another subject,
I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking maybe... you don't even need to work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close.
Give us another month or two, and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Hello.
Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank, I'm up.
Oh, good.
Uh, what you doing?
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I-I'll cut to it.
I got another favor to ask.
I've been thinking about this Gus Fring, right?
How he never goes anywhere, one restaurant, home, one restaurant, home, back and forth back and forth?
Which, now I'm even more convinced is bullshit, because the man owns
13 other restaurants, right?
So I started thinking about this little empire of his, right?
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging', and bingo!
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
Uh...
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean--
I'm looking at it online right now.
I tell you, it's a big warehouse and rows of these long poultry buildings, or hatcheries, or whatever you call 'em.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So.
Whaddya say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Uhh...
You know, Hank.
Um...
I mean, it sounds great.
It really does.
But I--
You know, I won't lie, uh--
You caught me...
somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking a dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's--
Embarrassingly, that's it.
You know, it's just... upset stomach, you know, and everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
Really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex.
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint me a picture.
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride for this one.
Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Look, I'm-
- I'm--
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.
And, um...
Do you think you could possibly hold off for a day or two?
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-
- You know--
You know, I just--
I would just really... love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and--
I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you,
- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it, all right?
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike.
Listen.
I just want to say, first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law,
My DEA-
- He--
Soon, he will probably, in the near future, take a ride out to a certain distribution center, to look around for things.
Look around for things.
And...
Yeah.
Uh.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
You're all set.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car care professional.
So.
A hand wax for you today?
Okay.
Great.
Please give this to your car care professional.
And the black Explorer?
Well, of course we could shampoo your floor mats, but really, deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck.
Oh, and SUVs are extra.
And please give this to your car care professional.
Thank you!
Please give this to your car care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you, uh--
Someone from the office, uh, said you worked down here, so I thought I'd... come down and say hi.
Wow.
Well, uh...
Hello.
You look great.
No.
I'm gonna like--
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you--
Hi, there.
Uh, thing is,
Skyler, um,
I really need to talk to you.
Ted,
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Awhile.
I'd... debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer?
Ted--
Ted, this is--
This is the CID.
The Criminal Division.
My God, you facing a felony charge here.
$100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe, plus five years in prison!
Yeah.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe, if um, there's some way you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could, uh, undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method, or some accounting trick
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.
It doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's gonna happen here, okay?
Once the CID sees this as willful tax fraud, there are going to build the strongest possible case against you, and once they start down that path, they have an 80% conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail, and tap your phones-- and not just you, Ted.
Everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you-- you--
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I, uh,
I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.
Somehow.
Okay?
Here.
Right here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent, poking' around your junk--
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him... for good.
But killing a cop--
I don't know.
It could look suspicious if, uh, the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White.
Who'd be even more ape shit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to the man, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch!
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
- Hey.
- Get down!
Sí.
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus just need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
Yo, like, uh,
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time, don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet, run and so forth.
But seriously, what--
What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?
Walking right into the bullets?
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But what?
The rest of us are like, open season?
Is he doing anything about that?
Or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while he's--
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
Do you want to say something about this?
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
Well, I-
- I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
- Hey, Ted.

What happened is good news.
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Look, pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.
All right?
You just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage on your house.
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets
- left to sell.
- Ted.
If you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation.
And that little fiction I just spun up there will completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah.
I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday to my man at the farm--
It was a terrible thing.
Oh, the dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I have invited you into my home, prepared food, so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that's happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first, I need you... to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce this product?
Without any help, alone?
No.
Why?
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago?
This is your plan, huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy and-- And make me feel important, then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White.
You want to-
- You want to talk like men?
Let's talk like men!
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
Hey, you, uh-- You headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White.
Hey, uh,
I really got to talk to you.
I-
- I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You uh-- You want a beer?
- Or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.
Okay, so, um--
Okay.
So... word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down?"
Yeah, the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation.
Like jacking trucks to like, send a message, and you know, yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab?
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off, but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like, what do you call, a rock and a hard place situation.
So Gus is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula, and he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, Gus doesn't trust you, so...
I gotta go-
- I mean, you're the chemist, man!
You know, not me.
Let's say I go down to, you know, go over there, go to the jungle or-
- Or whatever.
You know, and say they got, like, actual chemists, like cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you?
And what if, like, all the equipment is uh, is in Mexican, instead of English?
You know?
Oh!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up,
I am dead, you know?
All of us!
So I-
- Look, I-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could, like, coach me or something, you know?
Or you can give me some notes.
Mr. White.
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
Passed down?
By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
They did.
They--
So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you...
You weren't at Gus's house last night.
What?
What the hell?
J-Jesus--
It's still here.
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance.
All right?
Okay, I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me--
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay?
He just made this one big pot, and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do?
Huh?
Poison myself?
Two hours and 18 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do!
One thing!
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives.
Right there.
You were in his house!
And you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes, but you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you--
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry.
After everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You've killed me is what you've done.
You've signed my death warrant.
And now you want advice?
All right, I'll give you advice.
Go to Mexico and screw up, like I know you will, and wind up in a barrel somewhere!
Oh, God!
Can you walk?
Yeah.
You get the fuck out of here and never come back.
Ohh!
I got it, I got it.
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
-Morning.
-Hey, buddy.
-Ready to get your rocks on?
-See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for "strip club."
Yeah.
You got your singles?
-Got it?
-Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
-Got it. I got it.
-l'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.
Here's just hoping we get something good.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
Get the bad guy.
Yeah!
-But-- What are you doing, buddy?
-Leaving.
You gotta go inside, order something like last time.
Avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby, let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
That's work.
That's home.
That's work, that's home.
What, this guy he goes two places every day, all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that maybe, just maybe he's not your guy?
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place and I want to report and he's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I guess we'd better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey.
Got one of those for me?
-One of those what?
-Cigarette.
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
So, what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home. watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know, stuff.
Well, like what?
Like Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am gonna do it.
You gotta inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man?
Don't you have enough cancer already?
Look.
I said I'd do it. I'll do it.
Yeah, well what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Am I catching you at a bad time?
No. I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone doesn't want a big birthday, just wants to hang out with friends...
-...which is fine by me.
You?
-Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured a low-key family dinner, no official party and we bite the bullet and buy him a car.
Used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
Or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
You just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking, maybe you don't need to even work your second job.
-You're turning a profit?
-We're coming close.
Give us another month or two and, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
-Hello?
-Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank. I'm up.
Good.
What you doing?
I'm....
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favor to ask.
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns 1 3 other restaurants.
Right?
So I start thinking about this little empire of his.
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging, and bingo.
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
It's not far from town.
The place is huge. I mean I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
You know, Hank, I'm-- l'm-- l'm-- l mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm--
You know, I won't lie.
You've caught me somewhat indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking-a-dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's embarrassing.
That's it.
You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything--
-Yeah.
-lt's out of control.
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex...
-...at the mall.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
You don't have to paint a picture.
One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
-Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
-Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it. I'll find another ride.
-Another ride?
-Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Well, look, I'm-- This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours at the most.
And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two?
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I....
You know, I just-- I would just really love to be the one to be able to take you there.
And, I mean, I've just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you...
-...and helping you and--
-Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it.
Thank you. I will.
Okay.
Bye.
-Yeah.
-Mike, listen.
I just want to say first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law, my DE-
- He....
Soon, he will probably, in the near future take a ride out to a certain distribution center to look around for things.
Just look around for things.
And, yeah.
Mike?
-Where's this all going?
-Elsewhere.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
So a hand wax for you today?
Okay, great.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
And the black Explorer, we could shampoo your floor mats but deluxe detailing is the best for your buck.
And SUV's are extra.
And please give this to your car-care professional.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you...?
Someone from the office said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.
Well hello.
You look great.
No.
No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you....
Hi, there.
I guess, Skyler I'm gonna need to talk to you.
Ted, I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
-How long have you had this?
-A while.
I debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?
Ted, this is....
This is the cid.
The criminal division.
My God, you're facing a felony charge here.
A $1 00,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe...
-...plus five years in prison.
-Yeah.
-lt's bad.
-Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe if you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use--
Ted, it doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay?
Once the cid sees this is willful tax fraud they will build the strongest possible case against you.
Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry. I....
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
Okay?
Here.
So is he gonna kill him?
is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent poking around your junk.
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
But killing a cop I don't know.
It could look suspicious if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-
- There's Mr. White who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch.
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
Hey.
Get down!
Tell them the answer is "yes."
-Should I even ask?
-l wouldn't.
So, what?
is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again you go ahead and get two barrels.
Like I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.
But seriously, what--?
-What was the deal with Gus?
-The deal?
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But, what?
The rest of us are like open season?
is he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out...
-...for target practice while he--?
-Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
I'd have to have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
Hey, Ted.
-Sky.
-This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
-Hi.
You are...?
-Special Agent James Bekaris.
"Special." Skyler White.
Ms. white, you are the accountant of record for many of these reports, is that correct?
-Guilty as charged.
-Can you shed light on this history of missing revenue?
Missing?
No, it's there.
No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Let's take a look.
Oh, well, you know this account here, that is Mr. Keller's account.
And Mr. Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
He always sends an electronic payment which I hate, because I'm a real-paper person.
Mr. Keller is one of those environmental people.
Since there wasn't a physical check I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.
Ms. white, you've read Section 61 of the irc?
I did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
-Well, I think I am.
-No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
It doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
-Ms. white, how did you get this job?
-Ted hired me.
No, I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Well, I haven't had any training, per se.
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. white, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts...
-...anywhere else, are you?
-Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $61 7,000.
What am l--?
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage--
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.
Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation and that little fiction I just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah, I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday, to my man at the farm it was a terrible thing.
The dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I've invited you into my home prepared food so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that is happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first I need you to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce his product without any help?
Alone.
No.
Why?
You're asking me if I can cook Mr. white's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago.
This your plan?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is be my buddy and make me feel important.
Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. white?
You wanna-- You wanna talk like men?
Let's talk like men.
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would answer the question.
Hey, you headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White, hey. I really gotta talk to you. I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
-You-- You want a beer or something?
-No.
-Should I sit down?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, go ahead.
Okay, so....
Okay, so word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some-- Some sort of war brewing...
-...between Gus and the cartel.
-"Word has come down"?
The cartel has been-
- Has been messing with Gus' operation.
Like jacking trucks to, like, send a message.
And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off.
But between the cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.
So, Gus is-- ls gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.
Well, l-- l gotta give it to them. I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to--
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever and they got like actual chemists like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you.
And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English?
You know?
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up I'm dead, you know?
All of us.
Mr. white, look, I need-- l need your help.
Okay, maybe you could-- Maybe you could coach me or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.
Mr. white?
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
-You didn't see Gus.
-No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
"Passed down." By whom?
By....
By Mike and them.
-l mean, they did.
They--
-So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
-Why are you--?
-You weren't at Gus' house last night.
What?
What the hell?
Jesus.
Still here.
-lt's still here.
-Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I....
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?
Okay?
I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
What was I supposed to do, poison myself?
Two hours, 1 8 minutes, you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?
-He never left the room.
-You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do, one thing.
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives and you were right there.
You were in his house and you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 1 8 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?

Now you want advice?
I'll give you advice:
Go to Mexico and screw up like I know you will.
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!
You son of a--
Can you walk?
Yeah.
Then get the fuck out of here and never come back.
I got it.
Just--
Marie.
Bzzz.
Good morning.

Ready to get your rocks on?
See?
I knew it.
Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for strip club.

Yeah.

Got it.
I got it.
I'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.

Keep your fingers crossed.

This ain't no spy movie.
you know?
♪ Chk-a bom bom bom♪ bom bom bom♪
Get the bad guy!
it's the thrill of the fight♪
♪ Risin' up to keep 'em alive♪
buddy?
Leaving.
you got to go inside and order something like last time to avoid suspicion.
I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
baby.
Let's see what we got.
What the hell?
bom.
that's home.
this guy goes two places every day all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
is it possible that... just maybe... he's not your guy?
a guy this clean's got to be dirty.
buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
hi. and I want to report a very suspicious man who's lurking in my neighborhood. and he-
- He's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I would appreciate it.
All right.
So I guess we better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
uh...
You got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
Hmm.
So what have you been up to?
What?
just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Like what?
uh...
Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.
by the way.
don't you have enough cancer already?
I said...
I'd do it.
I'll do it.
what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
Hi.
Hi.
catching you at a bad time?
I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone doesn't want a big thing for his birthday. which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
and we bite the bullet and... buy him a car-- would be best.
But no more than five years old.
all that.
have any thoughts or should I just go ahead and-- you just go ahead.
Okay.
I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking maybe... you don't even need to work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close. we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Hello.
buddy.
Wake you?
I'm up.
what you doing?
uh...
I-I'll cut to it.
I got another favor to ask.
right?
back and forth back and forth?
now I'm even more convinced because the man owns right?
right?
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
and bingo!
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
Uh...
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean--
I'm looking at it online right now.
it's a big warehouse or whatever you call 'em.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
right?
Huh.
buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Uhh...
Hank.
Um... it sounds great.
It really does.
But I-- uh--
You caught me...
somewhat... indisposed.
like taking a dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's-- that's it.
it's just... and everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
Really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex.
yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint me a picture.
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.
Hank.
don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride for this one.
Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
I'm-
- I'm--
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
at the most.
um...
Do you think you could possibly hold off for a day or two?
I-
- You know--
I just--
I would just really... love to be the one to be able to-- and-- yeah.
sure.
If it means that much to you.
give me a call all right?
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
Mike. don't be angry.
Walter? My DEA-
- He-- take a ride out to to look around for things.
Look around for things.
And...
Yeah.
Uh.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
You're all set.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car care professional.
So.
A hand wax for you today?
Okay.
Great.
Please give this to your car care professional.
And the black Explorer? deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck.
and SUVs are extra.
And please give this to your car care professional.
Thank you!
Please give this to your car care professional.
Sky.
my God.
Ted.
uh-- so I thought I'd... come down and say hi.
uh...
Hello.
You look great.
No.
I'm gonna like--
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you--
there.
I really need to talk to you.
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
we do.
An audit?
an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Awhile.
I'd... contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer?
Ted-- this is--
This is the CID.
The Criminal Division.
you facing a felony charge here.
000 fine on top of the taxes plus five years in prison!
Yeah.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
here's the thing. there's some way you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
with your knowledge of how the books maybe there's some way undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
or some accounting trick use--
- Ted.
It doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
not you.
okay? there are going to build the strongest possible case they have an 80% conviction rate.
Ted.
Everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
you-- you-- okay?
They're after me.
not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry. okay?
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.
Somehow.
Okay?
Here.
Right here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude. poking' around your junk--
right?
Makes sense to get rid of him... for good.
But killing a cop--
I don't know. the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White.
Who'd be even more ape shit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider. would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch!
kid.
We may be here a while.
- Hey.
- Get down!
Sí.
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus just need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops you go ahead and get two barrels.
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
don't stand there like an idiot.
run and so forth.
what--
What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?
Walking right into the bullets?
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
open season?
Is he doing anything about that?
Or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while he's--
Kid. ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
Do you want to say something about this?
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out. have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
Ted.
- Sky.
Whoo!
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are--
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh.
Special.
Skyler White.
Ms. White.
You are the accountant of record for many of these reports.
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
perhaps you can shed some light on this history of missing revenue.
Missing?
Uh-huh.
it's there.
- No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.
But it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh!
let's take a look.
Hmm.
Oh.
this account here? but Mr. Keller's one of those environmental people. but... the money's there.
you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I... did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined.
I think I am.
you're not.
right?
Everyone's got one.
I am.
it doesn't matter if its an electronic check income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it. so that's gotta mean right?
Quicken.
Uh-huh.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
do you guys use that here?
'Cause it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
how did you get this job?
Ted hired me.
- No.
I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training? I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Teddy?
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
I just have to ask.
are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened is good news.
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance. and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
000.
just figure it out.
All right?
You just dodged prison. take out a second mortgage on your house.
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets
- left to sell.
- Ted.
they will reopen the investigation.
And that little fiction I just spun up there will completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah.
I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday to my man at the farm--
It was a terrible thing.
the dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah. so we could sit and talk. like men.
And I will explain everything that's happening.
I will answer your questions.
I need you... to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce this product?
alone?
No.
Why?
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago?
huh? be my buddy and-- And make me feel then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White.
You want to-
- You want to talk like men?
Let's talk like men!
you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war. answer the question.
uh-- You headed out?
Yeah.
I really got to talk to you.
I-
- I don't know
so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You uh-- You want a beer?
- Or something?
- No.
yeah.
sorry.
Go ahead.
um--
Okay.
So... word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
Word has come down?
the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation. that dude we brought to the lab?
they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away. but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net a rock and a hard place situation.
So Gus is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half and they want and he's gonna give it to them.
I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
so... man!
not me.
Let's say I go down go to the jungle or-
- Or whatever. asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you?
all the equipment instead of English?
You know?
Oh!
I don't know.
I don't know. you know?
All of us!
I-- I need your help.
maybe you could-- coach me you know?
Or you can give me some notes.
Mr. White.
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
like I said.
Passed down?
By whom?
uh...
By Mike and them.
They did.
They--
So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you...
You weren't at Gus's house last night.
What?
What the hell?
J-Jesus--
It's still here.
Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
um...
I didn't have a chance.
All right?
I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me--
That's why I didn't say anything.
okay? and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do?
Huh?
Poison myself? and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do! that would save our lives.
Right there.
You were in his house!
And you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:10 to 9:28 p.m. did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you--
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry.
After everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You've killed me is what you've done.
You've signed my death warrant.
And now you want advice?
I'll give you advice. and wind up in a barrel somewhere!
God!
Can you walk?
Yeah.
You get the fuck out of here and never come back.
I got it, I got it.
Just--
Bzzz.
Good morning.
Hey, buddy.
Ready to get your rocks on?
See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for strip club.
Hey, you got any singles?
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
Got it.
I got it.
I'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.
I just hope we get something good, you know?
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
♪ Chk-a bom bom bom♪
♪ Bom, chka-chka-chka-chka, bom bom bom♪
Get the bad guy!
♪ It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight♪
♪ Risin' up to keep 'em alive♪
Uhh!
What-
- What-
- But-
- But-- What are you doing, buddy?
Leaving.
No, you got to go inside and order something like last time to avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.
That's work, that's home, that's work, that's home.
What, this guy goes two places every day all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that... maybe, just maybe... he's not your guy?
Oh, a guy this clean's got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place, and I want to report a very suspicious man who's lurking in my neighborhood.
He's sitting in a blue Sedan, and he-
- He's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
So I guess we better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey, uh...
You got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
Like, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
Hmm.
So what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home, watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Like what?
Like, uh...
Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.
You got to inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man, don't you have enough cancer already?
Look, I said...
I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well, what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
Hi.
Hi.
Am I, uh, catching you at a bad time?
No, I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone doesn't want a big thing for his birthday.
He just wants to hang out with his friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured, uh, low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet and... buy him a car--
Uh, used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Air bags, safety rated, all that.
Do you, um, have any thoughts on what kind, or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
No, you just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen.
On another subject,
I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking maybe... you don't even need to work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close.
Give us another month or two, and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Hello.
Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank, I'm up.
Oh, good.
Uh, what you doing?
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I-I'll cut to it.
I got another favor to ask.
I've been thinking about this Gus Fring, right?
How he never goes anywhere, one restaurant, home, one restaurant, home, back and forth back and forth?
Which, now I'm even more convinced is bullshit, because the man owns
13 other restaurants, right?
So I started thinking about this little empire of his, right?
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging', and bingo!
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
Uh...
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean--
I'm looking at it online right now.
I tell you, it's a big warehouse and rows of these long poultry buildings, or hatcheries, or whatever you call 'em.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So.
Whaddya say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Uhh...
You know, Hank.
Um...
I mean, it sounds great.
It really does.
But I--
You know, I won't lie, uh--
You caught me...
somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking a dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's--
Embarrassingly, that's it.
You know, it's just... upset stomach, you know, and everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
Really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex.
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint me a picture.
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride for this one.
Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Look, I'm-
- I'm--
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.
And, um...
Do you think you could possibly hold off for a day or two?
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-
- You know--
You know, I just--
I would just really... love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and--
I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you,
- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it, all right?
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike.
Listen.
I just want to say, first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law,
My DEA-
- He--
Soon, he will probably, in the near future, take a ride out to a certain distribution center, to look around for things.
Look around for things.
And...
Yeah.
Uh.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
You're all set.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car care professional.
So.
A hand wax for you today?
Okay.
Great.
Please give this to your car care professional.
And the black Explorer?
Well, of course we could shampoo your floor mats, but really, deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck.
Oh, and SUVs are extra.
And please give this to your car care professional.
Thank you!
Please give this to your car care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you, uh--
Someone from the office, uh, said you worked down here, so I thought I'd... come down and say hi.
Wow.
Well, uh...
Hello.
You look great.
No.
I'm gonna like--
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you--
Hi, there.
Uh, thing is,
Skyler, um,
I really need to talk to you.
Ted,
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Awhile.
I'd... debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer?
Ted--
Ted, this is--
This is the CID.
The Criminal Division.
My God, you facing a felony charge here.
$100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe, plus five years in prison!
Yeah.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe, if um, there's some way you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could, uh, undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method, or some accounting trick
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.
It doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's gonna happen here, okay?
Once the CID sees this as willful tax fraud, there are going to build the strongest possible case against you, and once they start down that path, they have an 80% conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail, and tap your phones-- and not just you, Ted.
Everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you-- you--
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I, uh,
I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.
Somehow.
Okay?
Here.
Right here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent, poking' around your junk--
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him... for good.
But killing a cop--
I don't know.
It could look suspicious if, uh, the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White.
Who'd be even more ape shit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to the man, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch!
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
- Hey.
- Get down!
Sí.
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus just need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
Yo, like, uh,
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time, don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet, run and so forth.
But seriously, what--
What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?
Walking right into the bullets?
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But what?
The rest of us are like, open season?
Is he doing anything about that?
Or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while he's--
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
Do you want to say something about this?
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
Well, I-
- I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.
Whoo!
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are--
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh.
Special.
Skyler White.
Ms. White.
You are the accountant of record for many of these reports.
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
Well then, perhaps you can shed some light on this history of missing revenue.
Missing?
Uh-huh.
- No, it's there.
- No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.
But it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh!
Hmm, let's take a look.
Hmm.
Oh.
Well, you know, this account here?
That is Mr. Keller's account, and Mr. Keller's an old friend of Ted's dad, and he always sends an electronic payment, which personally I hate, because I'm a real paper person, but Mr. Keller's one of those environmental people.
So anyway, since there wasn't a physical check,
I didn't enter it into the book, but... the money's there.
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I... did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.
No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
Look, it doesn't matter if its an electronic check or a paper check, income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
Uh-huh.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Oh, do you guys use that here?
'Cause it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
Ms. White, how did you get this job?
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.
I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Ooh, well I haven't had any training per se,
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened is good news.
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Look, pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.
All right?
You just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage on your house.
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets
- left to sell.
- Ted.
If you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation.
And that little fiction I just spun up there will completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah.
I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday to my man at the farm--
It was a terrible thing.
Oh, the dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I have invited you into my home, prepared food, so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that's happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first, I need you... to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce this product?
Without any help, alone?
No.
Why?
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago?
This is your plan, huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy and-- And make me feel important, then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White.
You want to-
- You want to talk like men?
Let's talk like men!
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
Hey, you, uh-- You headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White.
Hey, uh,
I really got to talk to you.
I-
- I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You uh-- You want a beer?
- Or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.
Okay, so, um--
Okay.
So... word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down?"
Yeah, the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation.
Like jacking trucks to like, send a message, and you know, yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab?
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off, but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like, what do you call, a rock and a hard place situation.
So Gus is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula, and he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, Gus doesn't trust you, so...
I gotta go-
- I mean, you're the chemist, man!
You know, not me.
Let's say I go down to, you know, go over there, go to the jungle or-
- Or whatever.
You know, and say they got, like, actual chemists, like cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you?
And what if, like, all the equipment is uh, is in Mexican, instead of English?
You know?
Oh!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up,
I am dead, you know?
All of us!
So I-
- Look, I-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could, like, coach me or something, you know?
Or you can give me some notes.
Mr. White.
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
Passed down?
By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
They did.
They--
So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you...
You weren't at Gus's house last night.
What?
What the hell?
J-Jesus--
It's still here.
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance.
All right?
Okay, I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me--
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay?
He just made this one big pot, and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do?
Huh?
Poison myself?
Two hours and 18 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do!
One thing!
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives.
Right there.
You were in his house!
And you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes, but you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you--
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry.
After everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You've killed me is what you've done.
You've signed my death warrant.
And now you want advice?
All right, I'll give you advice.
Go to Mexico and screw up, like I know you will, and wind up in a barrel somewhere!
Oh, God!
Can you walk?
Yeah.
You get the fuck out of here and never come back.
Ohh!
[heavy breathing]
[gasping]
I got it, I got it.
Just--
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
Bzzz.
Good morning.
Hey, buddy.
Ready to get your rocks on?
See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for strip club.
Hey, you got any singles?
[chuckling]
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
Got it.
I got it.
I'm sorry.
[grunt]
[Hank] Christ.
Longest week ever.
[chuckling]
I just hope we get something good, you know?
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
[imitating "Eye of the Tiger" beat]

[Continues]

♪ Risin' up to keep 'em alive♪
Uhh!
What-
- What-
- But-
- But-- What are you doing, buddy?
Leaving.
No, you got to go inside and order something like last time to avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.
That's work, that's home, that's work, that's home.
What, this guy goes two places every day all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that... maybe, just maybe... he's not your guy?
Oh, a guy this clean's got to be dirty.
[sigh]
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place, and I want to report a very suspicious man who's lurking in my neighborhood.
He's sitting in a blue Sedan, and he-
- He's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
So I guess we better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey, uh...
You got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
Like, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
[coughing]
Hmm.
So what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home, watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Like what?
Like, uh...
Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.
You got to inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man, don't you have enough cancer already?
Look, I said...
I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well, what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
[adding machine clicks]
[Walt] Hi.
Hi.
Am I, uh, catching you at a bad time?
No, I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone doesn't want a big thing for his birthday.
He just wants to hang out with his friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured, uh, low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet and... buy him a car--
Uh, used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Air bags, safety rated, all that.
Do you, um, have any thoughts on what kind, or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
No, you just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen.
On another subject,
I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking maybe... you don't even need to work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close.
Give us another month or two, and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
[ring]
[ring]
[ring]
Hello.
Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank, I'm up.
Oh, good.
Uh, what you doing?
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I-I'll cut to it.
I got another favor to ask.
I've been thinking about this Gus Fring, right?
How he never goes anywhere, one restaurant, home, one restaurant, home, back and forth back and forth?
Which, now I'm even more convinced is bullshit, because the man owns
13 other restaurants, right?
So I started thinking about this little empire of his, right?
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging', and bingo!
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
Uh...
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean--
I'm looking at it online right now.
I tell you, it's a big warehouse and rows of these long poultry buildings, or hatcheries, or whatever you call 'em.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So.
Whaddya say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Uhh...
You know, Hank.
Um...
I mean, it sounds great.
It really does.
But I--
You know, I won't lie, uh--
You caught me...
somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking a dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's--
Embarrassingly, that's it.
You know, it's just... upset stomach, you know, and everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
Really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex.
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint me a picture.
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride for this one.
[grunts] Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Look, I'm-
- I'm--
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.
And, um...
Do you think you could possibly hold off for a day or two?
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-
- You know--
You know, I just--
I would just really... love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and--
I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you,
- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
[chuckles]
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it, all right?
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike.
Listen.
I just want to say, first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law,
My DEA-
- He--
Soon, he will probably, in the near future, take a ride out to a certain distribution center, to look around for things.
Look around for things.
And...
Yeah.
Uh.
[Mike hangs up]
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
You're all set.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car care professional.
So.
A hand wax for you today?
Okay.
Great.
Please give this to your car care professional.
And the black Explorer?
Well, of course we could shampoo your floor mats, but really, deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck.
Oh, and SUVs are extra.
And please give this to your car care professional.
Thank you!
[softly] Please give this to your car care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you, uh--
Someone from the office, uh, said you worked down here, so I thought I'd... come down and say hi.
Wow.
Well, uh...
Hello.
You look great.
No.
I'm gonna like--
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you--
Hi, there.
Uh, thing is,
Skyler, um,
I really need to talk to you.
Ted,
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Awhile.
I'd... debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer?
Ted--
Ted, this is--
This is the CID.
The Criminal Division.
My God, you facing a felony charge here.
$100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe, plus five years in prison!
Yeah.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe, if um, there's some way you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could, uh, undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method, or some accounting trick
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.
It doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's gonna happen here, okay?
Once the CID sees this as willful tax fraud, there are going to build the strongest possible case against you, and once they start down that path, they have an 80% conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail, and tap your phones-- and not just you, Ted.
Everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you-- you--
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I, uh,
I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.
Somehow.
Okay?
[door closes]
Here.
[Jesse] Right here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent, poking' around your junk--
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him... for good.
But killing a cop--
I don't know.
It could look suspicious if, uh, the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White.
Who'd be even more ape shit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to the man, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
[silence, wind rushing]
[rifle shot]
- [rifle shot]
- Son of a bitch!
[rifle shot]
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
[rifle shot]
[rifle shot]
- Hey.
- Get down!
[chuckles]
[phone rings] [ring]
[ring]
[ring] [ring]
[ring]
Sí.
[speaking Spanish]
[buzzer sounds]
[buzzer] [lock snaps open]
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus just need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
[Mike's footsteps]
Yo, like, uh,
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time, don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet, run and so forth.
But seriously, what--
What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?
Walking right into the bullets?
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But what?
The rest of us are like, open season?
Is he doing anything about that?
Or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while he's--
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
Do you want to say something about this?
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
Well, I-
- I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
[door opens]
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.
Whoo!
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are--
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh.
Special.
Skyler White.
Ms. White.
You are the accountant of record for many of these reports.
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
Well then, perhaps you can shed some light on this history of missing revenue.
Missing?
Uh-huh.
- No, it's there.
- No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.
But it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh!
Hmm, let's take a look.
Hmm.
Oh.
Well, you know, this account here?
That is Mr. Keller's account, and Mr. Keller's an old friend of Ted's dad, and he always sends an electronic payment, which personally I hate, because I'm a real paper person, but Mr. Keller's one of those environmental people.
So anyway, since there wasn't a physical check,
I didn't enter it into the book, but... the money's there.
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I... did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.
No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
[laughs]
But seriously, I am.
Look, it doesn't matter if its an electronic check or a paper check, income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
Uh-huh.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Oh, do you guys use that here?
'Cause it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
Ms. White, how did you get this job?
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.
I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Ooh, well I haven't had any training per se,
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
[sighs]
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened is good news.
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Look, pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.
All right?
You just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage on your house.
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets
- left to sell.
- Ted.
If you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation.
And that little fiction I just spun up there will completely unravel.
You have to settle.
[car beeps] Wish I could.
[doorbell rings]
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah.
I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
[knife cutting on wood]
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.
[cutting continues]
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday to my man at the farm--
It was a terrible thing.
Oh, the dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I have invited you into my home, prepared food, so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that's happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first, I need you... to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce this product?
Without any help, alone?
No.
Why?
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago?
This is your plan, huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy and-- And make me feel important, then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White.
You want to-
- You want to talk like men?
Let's talk like men!
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
[door opens]
[closes]
[Skyler breathing]
Hey, you, uh-- You headed out?
Yeah.
[Jesse] Yo, Mr. White.
Hey, uh,
I really got to talk to you.
I-
- I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You uh-- You want a beer?
- Or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.
Okay, so, um--
Okay.
So... word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down?"
Yeah, the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation.
Like jacking trucks to like, send a message, and you know, yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab?

Anyway, they've been holding them off, but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like, what do you call, a rock and a hard place situation.
So Gus is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula, and he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, Gus doesn't trust you, so...
I gotta go-
- I mean, you're the chemist, man!
You know, not me.
Let's say I go down to, you know, go over there, go to the jungle or-
- Or whatever.
You know, and say they got, like, actual chemists, like cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you?
And what if, like, all the equipment is uh, is in Mexican, instead of English?
You know?
Oh!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up,
I am dead, you know?
All of us!
So I-
- Look, I-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could, like, coach me or something, you know?
Or you can give me some notes.
Mr. White.
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
Passed down?
By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
They did.
They--
So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you...
You weren't at Gus's house last night.
What?
What the hell?
J-Jesus--
It's still here.
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance.
All right?
Okay, I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me--
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay?
He just made this one big pot, and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do?
Huh?
Poison myself?
Two hours and 18 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do!
One thing!
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives.
Right there.
You were in his house!
And you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes, but you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you--
[Scoffing] You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry.
After everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You've killed me is what you've done.
You've signed my death warrant.
And now you want advice?
All right, I'll give you advice.
Go to Mexico and screw up, like I know you will, and wind up in a barrel somewhere!

Hi.
Am I catching you at a bad time?
No. I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone doesn't want a big birthday, just wants to hang out with friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured a low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet, and buy him a car.
Used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
Or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
You just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking, maybe, you don't need to even work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close.
Give us another month or two and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say, maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.

Hey, buddy.

No, Hank. I'm up.
Oh, good, uh...
What you doing?
WALT:
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favor to ask.
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns 1 3 other restaurants.
Right?
So I start thinking about this little empire of his.
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging, and bingo.
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
It's not far from town.
The place is huge. I mean, I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings, or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Heh-heh.
Uh...
You know, Hank, I'm-- l'm-- l'm-- l mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm--
You know, I won't lie.
Um...
You've caught me somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking-a-dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's embarrassing.
That's it.
Um--
You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything--
Yeah.
It's out of control.
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex at the mall.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
You don't have to paint a picture.
One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it. I'll find another ride.
Uh...
Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh--
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Well, look, I'm-- This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours at the most.
And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two?
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I, uh...
You know, I just-- I would just really love to be the one to be able to take you there.
And, I mean, I've just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you and helping you and-- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.

Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you, uh...?
Someone from the office, uh, said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.
Wow.
Well, uh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha.
You look great.
No.
No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you, um...
Hi, there.
Um, I guess, Skyler, um, I'm gonna need to talk to you.
Uh, Ted, I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Um, a while.
I debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?
Ted, this is...
This is the cid.
The criminal division.
My God, you're facing a felony charge here.
A $1 00,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe, plus five years in prison.
Yeah.
Ahem.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe, if you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use--
Ted, it doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay?
Once the cid sees this is willful tax fraud, they will build the strongest possible case against you.
Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail, and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted, everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry. I, uh...
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
Okay?
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

[canister spraying]
JESSE:
So is he gonna kill him?
is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
[scrubbing]
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent poking around your junk.
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
[WATER splashing]
But killing a cop, I don't know.
It could look suspicious if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-
- There's Mr. White, who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
[sighs]
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?

Meth cooking and corpse disposal?

Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
Yo.
Like, um... I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.
But seriously, what--?
What was the deal with Gus?
The deal?
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But, what?
The rest of us are like open season?
is he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out for target practice while he--?
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
[DOOR OPENS]
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
Hey, Ted.
Sky.
Whoo.
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are...?
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh. "Special." Skyler White.
Ms. white, you are the accountant of record for many of these reports, is that correct?
Guilty as charged.
Can you shed light on this history of missing revenue?
Missing?
No, it's there.
Mm-hm.
No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company, but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh.
Mm.
Let's take a look.
Mm.
Oh, well, you know, this account here, that is Mr. Keller's account.
And Mr. Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
He always sends an electronic payment, which I hate, because I'm a real-paper person.
Mr. Keller is one of those environmental people.
Since there wasn't a physical check, I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.
Ms. white, you've read Section 61 of the irc?
I did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
Well, I think I am.
No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
[LAUGHS]
But seriously, I am.
It doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check, income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
Mm-hm.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
Ms. white, how did you get this job?
Ted hired me.
No, I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Ooh.
Well, I haven't had any training, per se.
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Uh...
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. white, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
TED:
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
SKYLER:
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $61 7,000.
What am l--?
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage--
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.
Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation, and that little fiction I just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
You have to settle.
[DOOR LOCK CHlRPS]

[Instrumental JAZZ music playing ON STEREO] I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah, I guess.

GUS:
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday, to my man at the farm, it was a terrible thing.
The dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I've invited you into my home, prepared food so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that is happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first, I need you to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce his product without any help?
Alone.
No.
Why?
You're asking me if I can cook Mr. white's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago.
This your plan?
Huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy, and make me feel important.
Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. white?
You wanna-- You wanna talk like men?
Let's talk like men.
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
[COVER sliding]
[BEEPS]
Hey, you headed out?
Yeah.
[answering machine BEEPS]
JESSE [OVER machine]:
Yo, Mr. White, hey. I really gotta talk to you. I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
JESSE:
Thank God.
Come on in.
You-
- You want a beer or something?
No.
Should I sit down?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, go ahead.
Okay, so, um...
Okay, so word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some-- Some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down"?
The cartel has been-- Has been messing with Gus' operation.
Like jacking trucks to, like, send a message.
And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off.
But between the cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.
So, Gus is-- ls gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.
Well, l-- l gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you, so I gotta go. I mean, you're the chemist, man, you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to--
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever, and they got like actual chemists, like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you.
And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English?
You know?
I don't know.
Ugh. I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up, I'm dead, you know?
All of us.
[panting]
Mr. white, look, I need-- l need your help.
Okay, maybe you could-- Maybe you could coach me or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.
Mr. white?
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
"Passed down." By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
I mean, they did.
They-- So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you--?
You weren't at Gus' house last night.
What?
What the hell?
Jesus.
Still here.
It's still here.
Jesus.
[sighs]
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?
Okay?
I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
What was I supposed to do, poison myself?
Two hours, 1 8 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?
He never left the room.
You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do, one thing.
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives, and you were right there.
You were in his house, and you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 1 8 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:1 0 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 1 8 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you.
Ugh!
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry, after everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You killed me, is what you've done!
You've signed my death warrant!

Hey, uh...
You got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
Like, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
Hmm.
So what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home, watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Like what?
Like, uh...
Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.
You got to inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man, don't you have enough cancer already?
Look, I said...
I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well, what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
Hi.
Hi.
Am I, uh, catching you at a bad time?
No, I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone doesn't want a big thing for his birthday.
He just wants to hang out with his friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured, uh, low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet and... buy him a car--
Uh, used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Air bags, safety rated, all that.
Do you, um, have any thoughts on what kind, or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
No, you just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen.
On another subject,
I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking maybe... you don't even need to work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close.
Give us another month or two, and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Hello.
Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank, I'm up.
Oh, good.
Uh, what you doing?
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I-I'll cut to it.
I got another favor to ask.
I've been thinking about this Gus Fring, right?
How he never goes anywhere, one restaurant, home, one restaurant, home, back and forth back and forth?
Which, now I'm even more convinced is bullshit, because the man owns
13 other restaurants, right?
So I started thinking about this little empire of his, right?
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging', and bingo!
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
Uh...
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean--
I'm looking at it online right now.
I tell you, it's a big warehouse and rows of these long poultry buildings, or hatcheries, or whatever you call 'em.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So.
Whaddya say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Uhh...
You know, Hank.
Um...
I mean, it sounds great.
It really does.
But I--
You know, I won't lie, uh--
You caught me...
somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking a dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's--
Embarrassingly, that's it.
You know, it's just... upset stomach, you know, and everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
Really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex.
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint me a picture.
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride for this one.
Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Look, I'm-
- I'm--
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.
And, um...
Do you think you could possibly hold off for a day or two?
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-
- You know--
You know, I just--
I would just really... love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and--
I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you,
- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it, all right?
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike.
Listen.
I just want to say, first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law,
My DEA-
- He--
Soon, he will probably, in the near future, take a ride out to a certain distribution center, to look around for things.
Look around for things.
And...
Yeah.
Uh.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
You're all set.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car care professional.
So.
A hand wax for you today?
Okay.
Great.
Please give this to your car care professional.
And the black Explorer?
Well, of course we could shampoo your floor mats, but really, deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck.
Oh, and SUVs are extra.
And please give this to your car care professional.
Thank you!
Please give this to your car care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you, uh--
Someone from the office, uh, said you worked down here, so I thought I'd... come down and say hi.
Wow.
Well, uh...
Hello.
You look great.
No.
I'm gonna like--
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you--
Hi, there.
Uh, thing is,
Skyler, um,
I really need to talk to you.
Ted,
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Awhile.
I'd... debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer?
Ted--
Ted, this is--
This is the CID.
The Criminal Division.
My God, you facing a felony charge here.
$100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe, plus five years in prison!
Yeah.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe, if um, there's some way you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could, uh, undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method, or some accounting trick
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.
It doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's gonna happen here, okay?
Once the CID sees this as willful tax fraud, there are going to build the strongest possible case against you, and once they start down that path, they have an 80% conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail, and tap your phones-- and not just you, Ted.
Everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you-- you--
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I, uh,
I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.
Somehow.
Okay?
Here.
Right here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent, poking' around your junk--
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him... for good.
But killing a cop--
I don't know.
It could look suspicious if, uh, the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White.
Who'd be even more ape shit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to the man, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch!
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
- Hey.
- Get down!
Sí.
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus just need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
Yo, like, uh,
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time, don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet, run and so forth.
But seriously, what--
What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?
Walking right into the bullets?
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But what?
The rest of us are like, open season?
Is he doing anything about that?
Or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while he's--
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
Do you want to say something about this?
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
Well, I-
- I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.
Whoo!
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are--
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh.
Special.
Skyler White.
Ms. White.
You are the accountant of record for many of these reports.
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
Well then, perhaps you can shed some light on this history of missing revenue.
Missing?
Uh-huh.
- No, it's there.
- No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.
But it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh!
Hmm, let's take a look.
Hmm.
Oh.
Well, you know, this account here?
That is Mr. Keller's account, and Mr. Keller's an old friend of Ted's dad, and he always sends an electronic payment, which personally I hate, because I'm a real paper person, but Mr. Keller's one of those environmental people.
So anyway, since there wasn't a physical check,
I didn't enter it into the book, but... the money's there.
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I... did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.
No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
Look, it doesn't matter if its an electronic check or a paper check, income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
Uh-huh.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Oh, do you guys use that here?
'Cause it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
Ms. White, how did you get this job?
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.
I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Ooh, well I haven't had any training per se,
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened is good news.
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Look, pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.
All right?
You just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage on your house.
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets
- left to sell.
- Ted.
If you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation.
And that little fiction I just spun up there will completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah.
I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday to my man at the farm--
It was a terrible thing.
Oh, the dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I have invited you into my home, prepared food, so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that's happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first, I need you... to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce this product?
Without any help, alone?
No.
Why?
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago?
This is your plan, huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy and-- And make me feel important, then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White.
You want to-
- You want to talk like men?
Let's talk like men!
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
Hey, you, uh-- You headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White.
Hey, uh,
I really got to talk to you.
I-
- I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You uh-- You want a beer?
- Or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.
Okay, so, um--
Okay.
So... word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down?"
Yeah, the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation.
Like jacking trucks to like, send a message, and you know, yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab?
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off, but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like, what do you call, a rock and a hard place situation.
So Gus is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula, and he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, Gus doesn't trust you, so...
I gotta go-
- I mean, you're the chemist, man!
You know, not me.
Let's say I go down to, you know, go over there, go to the jungle or-
- Or whatever.
You know, and say they got, like, actual chemists, like cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you?
And what if, like, all the equipment is uh, is in Mexican, instead of English?
You know?
Oh!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up,
I am dead, you know?
All of us!
So I-
- Look, I-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could, like, coach me or something, you know?
Or you can give me some notes.
Mr. White.
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
Passed down?
By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
They did.
They--
So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you...
You weren't at Gus's house last night.
What?
What the hell?
J-Jesus--
It's still here.
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance.
All right?
Okay, I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me--
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay?
He just made this one big pot, and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do?
Huh?
Poison myself?
Two hours and 18 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do!
One thing!
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives.
Right there.
You were in his house!
And you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes, but you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you--
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry.
After everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You've killed me is what you've done.
You've signed my death warrant.
And now you want advice?
All right, I'll give you advice.
Go to Mexico and screw up, like I know you will, and wind up in a barrel somewhere!
Oh, God!
Can you walk?
Yeah.
You get the fuck out of here and never come back.
Ohh!
I got it, I got it.
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
- Morning.
- Hey, buddy.
- Ready to get your rocks on?
- See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for "strip club."
Yeah.
You got your singles?
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
- Got it.
I got it.
- I'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.
Here's just hoping we get something good.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
Get the bad guy.
Yeah!
- But...
What are you doing, buddy?
- Leaving.
You gotta go inside, order something like last time.
Avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby, let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
That's work.
That's home.
That's work, that's home.
What, this guy he goes two places every day, all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that maybe, just maybe he's not your guy?
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place and I want to report...
He's sitting in a blue sedan and he's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
I guess we'd better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey.
Got one of those for me?
- One of those what?
- Cigarette.
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
So, what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home. watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know, stuff.
Well, like what?
Like lce Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am gonna do it.
You gotta inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man?
Don't you have enough cancer already?
Look.
I said I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Am I catching you at a bad time?
No.
I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone doesn't want a big birthday, just wants to hang out with friends...
- ...which is fine by me.
You?
- Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured a low-key family dinner, no official party and we bite the bullet and buy him a car.
Used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
Or should I just go ahead and...
Yeah.
You just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking, maybe you don't need to even work your second job.
- You're turning a profit?
- We're coming close.
Give us another month or two and, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank.
I'm up.
Good.
What you doing?
I'm...
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favor to ask.
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns 13 other restaurants.
Right?
So I start thinking about this little empire of his.
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging, and bingo.
Polios Hermanos has a main distribution center.
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
You know, Hank, I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
I mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm...
You know, I won't lie.
You've caught me somewhat indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking-a-dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's embarrassing.
That's it.
You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex...
- ...at the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint a picture.
One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
- Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
- Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride.
- Another ride?
- Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Well, look, I'm...
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours at the most.
And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two?
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I...
You know, I just...
I would just really love to be the one to be able to take you there.
And, I mean, I've just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you...
- ...and helping you and...

Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it.
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Mike, listen.
I just want to say first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law, my DE...
He...
Soon, he will probably, in the near future take a ride out to a certain distribution center to look around for things.
Just look around for things.
And, yeah.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
So a hand wax for you today?
Okay, great.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
And the black Explorer, we could shampoo your floor mats but deluxe detailing is the best for your buck.
And SUV's are extra.
And please give this to your car-care professional.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you...?
Someone from the office said you worked down here.

Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I...
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
Okay?
Here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent poking around your junk.
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
But killing a cop I don't know.
It could look suspicious if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's...
There's Mr. White who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch.
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
Hey.
Get down!
Tell them the answer is "yes."
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So, what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again you go ahead and get two barrels.
Like I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.
But seriously, what...?
- What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But, what?
The rest of us are like open season?
Is he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out...
- ...for target practice while he...?
- Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
I'd have to have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
Hey, Ted.
- Sky.
- This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
- Hi.
You are...?
- Special Agent James Bekaris.
"Special." Skyler White.
Ms. white, you are the accountant of record for many of these reports, is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
- Can you shed light on this history of missing revenue?
Missing?
No, it's there.
No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Let's take a look.
Oh, well, you know this account here, that is Mr. Keller's account.
And Mr. Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
He always sends an electronic payment which I hate, because I'm a real-paper person.
Mr. Keller is one of those environmental people.
Since there wasn't a physical check I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.
Ms. white, you've read Section 61 of the irc?
I did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.
- No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
It doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check...
When I input everything into the Quicken nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
- Ms. white, how did you get this job?
- Ted hired me.
No, I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Well, I haven't had any training, per se.
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. white, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts...
- ...anywhere else, are you?
- Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
What am I...?
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage...
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.
Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation and that little fiction I just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah, I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday, to my man at the farm it was a terrible thing.
The dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I've invited you into my home prepared food so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that is happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first I need you to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce his product without any help?
Alone.
No.
Why?
You're asking me if I can cook Mr. white's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago.
This your plan?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is be my buddy and make me feel important.
Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. white?
You wanna...
You wanna talk like men?
Let's talk like men.
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would answer the question.
Hey, you headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White, hey.
I really gotta talk to you.
I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
- You...
You want a beer or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, go ahead.
Okay, so...
Okay, so word has come down that they...
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some...
Some sort of war brewing...
- ...between Gus and the cartel.
- "Word has come down"?
The cartel has been...
Has been messing with Gus' operation.
Like jacking trucks to, like, send a message.
And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off.
But between the cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.
So, Gus is...
ls gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I...
I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to...
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever and they got like actual chemists like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you.
And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English?
You know?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up I'm dead, you know?
All of us.
Mr. white, look, I need...
I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could...
Maybe you could coach me or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.
Mr. white?
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
- You didn't see Gus.
- No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
"Passed down." By whom?
By...
By Mike and them.
- I mean, they did.
They...
- So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
- Why are you...?
- You weren't at Gus' house last night.
What?
What the hell?
Jesus.
Still here.
- It's still here.
- Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
L...
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?
Okay?
I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
What was I supposed to do, poison myself?
Two hours, 18 minutes, you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?
- He never left the room.
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do, one thing.
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives and you were right there.
You were in his house and you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
- You bugged my car?
- 7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you.
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry, after everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You killed me, is what you've done!
You've signed my death warrant!
Now you want advice?
I'll give you advice:
Go to Mexico and screw up like I know you will.
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!
You son of a...
Can you walk?
Yeah.
Then get the fuck out of here and never come back.
I got it, I got it.
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
- Morning.
- Hey, buddy.
- Ready to get your rocks on?
- See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for "strip club."
Yeah.
You got your singles?
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
- Got it.
I got it.
- I'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.
Here's just hoping we get something good.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
Get the bad guy.
Yeah!
- But
- But
- What are you doing, buddy?
- Leaving.
You gotta go inside, order something like last time.
Avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby, let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
That's work.
That's home.
That's work, that's home.
What, this guy he goes two places every day, all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that maybe, just maybe he's not your guy?
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place and I want to report a very suspicious man lurking in my neighbourhood.
He's sitting in a blue sedan and he's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
I guess we'd better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey.
Got one of those for me?
- One of those what?
- Cigarette.
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
So, what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home.
Watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know, stuff.
Well, like what?
Like Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am gonna do it.
You gotta inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man?
Don't you have enough cancer already?
Look.
I said I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
- Hi.
- Hi
Am I catching you at a bad time?
No.
I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone doesn't want a big birthday, just wants to hang out with friends...
- ...which is fine by me.
You?
- Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured a low-key family dinner, no official party and we bite the bullet and buy him a car.
Used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
Or should I just go ahead and -
Yeah.
You just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking, maybe you don't need to even work your second job.
- You're turning a profit?
- We're coming close.
Give us another month or two and, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank.
I'm up.
Good.
What you doing?
I'm...
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favour to ask.
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns 13 other restaurants.
Right?
So I start thinking about this little empire of his.
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging, and bingo.
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution centre.
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
You know, Hank, I'm
- I'm
- I'm -
I mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm -
You know, I won't lie.
You've caught me somewhat indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking-a-dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's embarrassing.
That's it.
You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything -
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex...
- ...at the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint a picture.
One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
- Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
- Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride.
- Another ride?
- Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Well, look, I'm - This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours at the most.
And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two?
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I...
You know, I just - I would just really love to be the one to be able to take you there.
And, I mean, I've just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you...
- ...and helping you and -
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it.
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Mike, listen.
I just want to say first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law, my DE
- He...
Soon, he will probably, in the near future take a ride out to a certain distribution centre to look around for things.
Just look around for things.
And, yeah.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
So a hand wax for you today?
Okay, great.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
And the black Explorer, we could shampoo your floor mats but deluxe detailing is the best for your buck.
And SUV's are extra.
And please give this to your car-care professional.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you...?
Someone from the office said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.
Well hello.
You look great.
No.
No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you...
Hi, there.
I guess, Skyler I'm gonna need to talk to you.
Ted, I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
- How long have you had this?
- A while.
I debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?
Ted, this is...
This is the CID.
The criminal division.
My God, you're facing a felony charge here.
A $100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe...
- ...plus five years in prison.
- Yeah.
- It's bad.
- Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe if you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use -
Ted, it doesn't work like that.
The damage is already -
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay?
Once the CID sees this is wilful tax fraud they will build the strongest possible case against you.
Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offence.
I'm sorry.
I...
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
Okay?
Here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A- hole DEA agent poking around your junk.
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
But killing a cop I don't know.

It doesn't matter if it's an electronic cheque or a paper cheque income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.

The cartel has been - Has been messing with Gus' operation.
Like jacking trucks to, like, send a message.
And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off.
But between the cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.
So, Gus is
- Is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to -
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever and they got like actual chemists like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you.
And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English?
You know?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up I'm dead, you know?
All of us.
Mr. White, look, I need - I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could - Maybe you could coach me or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.
Mr. White?
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
- You didn't see Gus.
- No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
"Passed down. " By whom?
By...
By Mike and them.
- I mean, they did.
They -
- So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
- Why are you-?
- You weren't at Gus' house last night.
What?
What the hell?
Jesus.
Still here.
- It's still here.
- Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I...
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?
Okay?
I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
What was I supposed to do, poison myself?
Two hours, 18 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?
- He never left the room.
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do, one thing.
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives and you were right there.
You were in his house and you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
- You bugged my car?
- 7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you.
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry, after everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You killed me, is what you've done!
You've signed my death warrant!
Now you want advice?
I'll give you advice:
Go to Mexico and screw up like I know you will.
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!
You son of a -
Can you walk?
Yeah.
Then get the fuck out of here and never come back.
I got it, I got it.
Just--
You're like a bee at a damn picnic, Marie.
Bzzz.
Good morning.
Hey, buddy.
Ready to get your rocks on?
See?
I knew it.
"Mineral show" is just some sort of guy code for strip club.
Hey, you got any singles?
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?
Cram one more giant geode in here, we'll be sleeping in the garage.
Got it.
I got it.
I'm sorry.
Christ.
Longest week ever.
I just hope we get something good, you know?
Keep your fingers crossed.
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.
It's more like Rocky, you know?
♪ Chk-a bom bom bom♪
♪ Bom, chka-chka-chka-chka, bom bom bom♪
Get the bad guy!
♪ It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight♪
♪ Risin' up to keep 'em alive♪
Uhh!
What-
- What-
- But-
- But-- What are you doing, buddy?
Leaving.
No, you got to go inside and order something like last time to avoid suspicion.
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.
We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.
That's work, that's home, that's work, that's home.
What, this guy goes two places every day all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that... maybe, just maybe... he's not your guy?
Oh, a guy this clean's got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place, and I want to report a very suspicious man who's lurking in my neighborhood.
He's sitting in a blue Sedan, and he-
- He's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
If you would, I would appreciate it.
All right.
So I guess we better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey, uh...
You got one of those for me?
One of those what?
Cigarette.
Like, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
Hmm.
So what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home, watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know.
Stuff.
Like what?
Like, uh...
Ice Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am going to do it.
You got to inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man, don't you have enough cancer already?
Look, I said...
I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well, what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
Hi.
Hi.
Am I, uh, catching you at a bad time?
No, I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm Almost 16 So Leave Me Alone doesn't want a big thing for his birthday.
He just wants to hang out with his friends, which is fine by me.
You?
Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured, uh, low-key family dinner, no official party, and we bite the bullet and... buy him a car--
Uh, used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Air bags, safety rated, all that.
Do you, um, have any thoughts on what kind, or should I just go ahead and--
Yeah.
No, you just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen.
On another subject,
I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking maybe... you don't even need to work your second job.
You're turning a profit?
We're coming close.
Give us another month or two, and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Hello.
Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank, I'm up.
Oh, good.
Uh, what you doing?
I'm, uh...
Hey, listen, I-I'll cut to it.
I got another favor to ask.
I've been thinking about this Gus Fring, right?
How he never goes anywhere, one restaurant, home, one restaurant, home, back and forth back and forth?
Which, now I'm even more convinced is bullshit, because the man owns
13 other restaurants, right?
So I started thinking about this little empire of his, right?
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging', and bingo!
Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
Uh...
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean--
I'm looking at it online right now.
I tell you, it's a big warehouse and rows of these long poultry buildings, or hatcheries, or whatever you call 'em.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
Huh.
So.
Whaddya say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
Uhh...
You know, Hank.
Um...
I mean, it sounds great.
It really does.
But I--
You know, I won't lie, uh--
You caught me...
somewhat... indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking a dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's--
Embarrassingly, that's it.
You know, it's just... upset stomach, you know, and everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
Really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex.
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint me a picture.
Probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Hank.
Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride for this one.
Another ride?
Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Look, I'm-
- I'm--
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.
And, um...
Do you think you could possibly hold off for a day or two?
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-
- You know--
You know, I just--
I would just really... love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and--
I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you,
- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it, all right?
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike.
Listen.
I just want to say, first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law,
My DEA-
- He--
Soon, he will probably, in the near future, take a ride out to a certain distribution center, to look around for things.
Look around for things.
And...
Yeah.
Uh.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
You're all set.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car care professional.
So.
A hand wax for you today?
Okay.
Great.
Please give this to your car care professional.
And the black Explorer?
Well, of course we could shampoo your floor mats, but really, deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck.
Oh, and SUVs are extra.
And please give this to your car care professional.
Thank you!
Please give this to your car care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you, uh--
Someone from the office, uh, said you worked down here, so I thought I'd... come down and say hi.
Wow.
Well, uh...
Hello.
You look great.
No.
I'm gonna like--
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you--
Hi, there.
Uh, thing is,
Skyler, um,
I really need to talk to you.
Ted,
I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
How long have you had this?
Awhile.
I'd... debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer?
Ted--
Ted, this is--
This is the CID.
The Criminal Division.
My God, you facing a felony charge here.
$100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe, plus five years in prison!
Yeah.
It's bad.
Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe, if um, there's some way you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could, uh, undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method, or some accounting trick
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.
It doesn't work like that.
The damage is already--
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's gonna happen here, okay?
Once the CID sees this as willful tax fraud, there are going to build the strongest possible case against you, and once they start down that path, they have an 80% conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail, and tap your phones-- and not just you, Ted.
Everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you-- you--
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I, uh,
I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm gonna figure out a way through this.
Somehow.
Okay?
Here.
Right here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Is who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent, poking' around your junk--
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him... for good.
But killing a cop--
I don't know.
It could look suspicious if, uh, the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's-- There's Mr. White.
Who'd be even more ape shit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to the man, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch!
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
- Hey.
- Get down!
Sí.
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So what?
Is this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus just need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again, you go ahead and get two barrels.
Yo, like, uh,
I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time, don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet, run and so forth.
But seriously, what--
What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?
Walking right into the bullets?
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But what?
The rest of us are like, open season?
Is he doing anything about that?
Or do we just keep hanging out for target practice while he's--
Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
Do you want to say something about this?
Because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
Well, I-
- I'd have to, um, have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.
Whoo!
This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
Hi.
You are--
Special Agent James Bekaris.
Ooh.
Special.
Skyler White.
Ms. White.
You are the accountant of record for many of these reports.
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
Well then, perhaps you can shed some light on this history of missing revenue.
Missing?
Uh-huh.
- No, it's there.
- No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company.
But it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Huh!
Hmm, let's take a look.
Hmm.
Oh.
Well, you know, this account here?
That is Mr. Keller's account, and Mr. Keller's an old friend of Ted's dad, and he always sends an electronic payment, which personally I hate, because I'm a real paper person, but Mr. Keller's one of those environmental people.
So anyway, since there wasn't a physical check,
I didn't enter it into the book, but... the money's there.
Ms. White, you've read Section 61 of the IRC?
I... did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined.
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.
No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
Look, it doesn't matter if its an electronic check or a paper check, income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.
When I input everything into the Quicken, nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
Uh-huh.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Oh, do you guys use that here?
'Cause it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
Ms. White, how did you get this job?
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.
I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Ooh, well I haven't had any training per se,
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened is good news.
Ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Look, pay your back taxes, pay the penalties, and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.
All right?
You just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage on your house.
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets
- left to sell.
- Ted.
If you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation.
And that little fiction I just spun up there will completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah.
I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday to my man at the farm--
It was a terrible thing.
Oh, the dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I have invited you into my home, prepared food, so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business, our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that's happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first, I need you... to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce this product?
Without any help, alone?
No.
Why?
You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago?
This is your plan, huh?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is, be my buddy and-- And make me feel important, then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White.
You want to-
- You want to talk like men?
Let's talk like men!
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would, answer the question.
Hey, you, uh-- You headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White.
Hey, uh,
I really got to talk to you.
I-
- I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important, so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
You uh-- You want a beer?
- Or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.
Okay, so, um--
Okay.
So... word has come down that they--
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the cartel.
"Word has come down?"
Yeah, the cartel has been messing with Gus's operation.
Like jacking trucks to like, send a message, and you know, yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab?
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off, but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like, what do you call, a rock and a hard place situation.
So Gus is gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation, and they want your formula, and he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I-
- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, Gus doesn't trust you, so...
I gotta go-
- I mean, you're the chemist, man!
You know, not me.
Let's say I go down to, you know, go over there, go to the jungle or-
- Or whatever.
You know, and say they got, like, actual chemists, like cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you?
And what if, like, all the equipment is uh, is in Mexican, instead of English?
You know?
Oh!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up,
I am dead, you know?
All of us!
So I-
- Look, I-- I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could, like, coach me or something, you know?
Or you can give me some notes.
Mr. White.
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
You didn't see Gus.
No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
Passed down?
By whom?
By, uh...
By Mike and them.
They did.
They--
So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
Why are you...
You weren't at Gus's house last night.
What?
What the hell?
J-Jesus--
It's still here.
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
I, um...
Look, I didn't have a chance.
All right?
Okay, I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me--
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay?
He just made this one big pot, and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do?
Huh?
Poison myself?
Two hours and 18 minutes, and you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him.
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do!
One thing!
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives.
Right there.
You were in his house!
And you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
You bugged my car?
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes, but you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you--
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry.
After everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You've killed me is what you've done.
You've signed my death warrant.
And now you want advice?
All right, I'll give you advice.
Go to Mexico and screw up, like I know you will, and wind up in a barrel somewhere!
Oh, God!
Can you walk?
Yeah.
You get the fuck out of here and never come back.
Ohh!

We'll use the drive-through.
All right, baby, let's see what we got.
What the hell?
Look at this.
That's work.
That's home.
That's work, that's home.
What, this guy he goes two places every day, all week?
It's unbelievable.
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.
Hank, is it possible that maybe, just maybe he's not your guy?
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.
What's the play here, buddy?
How do I get this guy?
Yeah.
How?
Yes, hi.
I live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place and I want to report and he's been staring at a particular house for a very long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I guess we'd better get started.
I already did.
Yeah?
Hey.
Got one of those for me?
- One of those what?
- Cigarette.
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.
Just give me one.
So, what have you been up to?
What?
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?
Go home.
Watch TV.
What do you watch?
I don't know, stuff.
Well, like what?
Like lce Road Truckers.
Ice Road Truckers.
What happens on that one?
Guys drive on ice.
I am gonna do it.
You gotta inhale, by the way.
What the hell, man?
Don't you have enough cancer already?
Look.
I said I'd do it.
I'll do it.
Yeah, well what does it matter?
We're both dead men anyway.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Am I catching you at a bad time?
No.
I have a few minutes.
So Mr. I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone doesn't want a big birthday, just wants to hang out with friends...
- ...which is fine by me.
You?
- Fine by me.
Okay.
So I figured a low-key family dinner, no official party and we bite the bullet and buy him a car.
Used, I was thinking, would be best.
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
Or should I just go ahead and...
Yeah.
You just go ahead.
Okay.
Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
Really good.
So good that I'm thinking, maybe you don't need to even work your second job.
- You're turning a profit?
- We're coming close.
Give us another month or two and, yeah, we'll be there.
All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.
Wake you?
No, Hank.
I'm up.
Good.
What you doing?
I'm...
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favor to ask.
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns 13 other restaurants.
Right?
So I start thinking about this little empire of his.
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?
What's the base of operations?
So I do a little digging, and bingo.
Polios Hermanos has a main distribution center.
It's not far from town.
The place is huge.
I mean I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?
You know, Hank, I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
I mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm...
You know, I won't lie.
You've caught me somewhat indisposed.
What do you mean, like taking-a-dump indisposed?
Yeah.
That's embarrassing.
That's it.
You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything...
- Yeah.
- It's out of control.
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex...
- ...at the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
You don't have to paint a picture.
One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
- Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
- Hey, don't be.
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it.
I'll find another ride.
- Another ride?
- Yeah.
I'm sure I can get someone else to take me.
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.
Well, look, I'm...
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.
Maybe 48 hours at the most.
And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two?
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I...
You know, I just...
I would just really love to be the one to be able to take you there.
And, I mean, I've just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you...
- ...and helping you and...
- Well, yeah.
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.
Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it.
Thank you.
I will.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yeah.
- Mike, listen.
I just want to say first off, don't be angry.
What is it, Walter?
My brother-in-law, my DE...
He...
Soon, he will probably, in the near future take a ride out to a certain distribution center to look around for things.
Just look around for things.
And, yeah.
Mike?
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
So a hand wax for you today?
Okay, great.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
And the black Explorer, we could shampoo your floor mats but deluxe detailing is the best for your buck.
And SUV's are extra.
And please give this to your car-care professional.
Thank you.
Please give this to your car-care professional.
Hey, Sky.
Oh, my God.
Ted.
What are you...?
Someone from the office said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.
Well hello.
You look great.
No.
No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.
Not at all.
You look happy.
Last time I saw you...
Hi, there.
I guess, Skyler I'm gonna need to talk to you.
Ted, I really don't think we have anything to talk about.
Actually, we do.
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?
- How long have you had this?
- A while.
I debated, you know, contacting you.
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?
Ted, this is...
This is the CID.
The criminal division.
My God, you're facing a felony charge here.
A $100,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe...
- ...plus five years in prison.
- Yeah.
- It's bad.
- Yeah.
It most certainly is.
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe if you could help with this.
Help?
Help how?
Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could undo what's in there.
You want me to uncook your books?
Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use...
Ted, it doesn't work like that.
The damage is already...
My name.
My signatures are all over those books.
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.
Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay?
Once the CID sees this is willful tax fraud they will build the strongest possible case against you.
Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted everyone involved in those books.
I can't have this in my life.
I cannot be audited.
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.
It's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
No offense.
I'm sorry.
I...
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?
I'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
Okay?
Here.
So is he gonna kill him?
Ls who gonna kill who?
Gus.
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's brother-in-law?
I mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
A-hole DEA agent poking around your junk.
Who needs that, right?
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
But killing a cop I don't know.
It could look suspicious if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
Then there's...
There's Mr. White who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
He'd never cook for Gus again.
Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
If something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that?
Who really cares what I think?
Son of a bitch.
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.
Hey.
Get down!
Tell them the answer is "yes."
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.
So, what?
Ls this going to be a regular thing now?
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
What was it this time?
What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
Or did Gus need to send another message?
Shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
Just get the barrel.
And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again you go ahead and get two barrels.
Like I guess I never thanked you for what you did.
Thanks.
Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.
But seriously, what...?
- What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.
What the hell was he doing?
The cartel needs Gus.
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.
But, what?
The rest of us are like open season?
Is he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out...
- ...for target practice while he...?
- Kid.
Enough.
You got questions, ask him yourself.
And here again.
Unreported income.
That's more than a year straight so far.
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
I'd have to have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke.
That's why we're here.
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
I got lost.
Hey, Ted.
- Sky.
- This building is so confusing.
There are doors everywhere.
- Hi.
You are...?
- Special Agent James Bekaris.
"Special." Skyler White.
Ms. white, you are the accountant of record for many of these reports, is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.
- Can you shed light on this history of missing revenue?
Missing?
No, it's there.
No.
Revenue most definitely flowed through this company but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
Let's take a look.
Oh, well, you know this account here, that is Mr. Keller's account.
And Mr. Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
He always sends an electronic payment which I hate, because I'm a real-paper person.
Mr. Keller is one of those environmental people.
Since there wasn't a physical check I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.
Ms. white, you've read Section 61 of the irc?
I did not follow what you just said.
How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.
- No, you're not.
Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
Everyone's got one.
But seriously, I am.
It doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
Quicken.
You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
I did.
Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.
It's like having a calculator on your computer.
Amazing.
- Ms. white, how did you get this job?
- Ted hired me.
No, I mean your qualifications.
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?
Well, I haven't had any training, per se.
I've always been naturally good with numbers.
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?
Right.
This is all falling into place now.
Ms. white, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts...
- ...anywhere else, are you?
- Right now?
No.
I'm a cashier at a car wash.
I'm not really clear about what happened in there.
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.
Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.
Pay with what?
I owe them $617,000.
What am I...?
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage...
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.
Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation and that little fiction I just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
You have to settle.
Wish I could.
Come in.
I hope you brought an appetite.
Yeah, I guess.
Mike mentioned you have some questions.
Yeah.
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.
Right on.
What am I doing here?
I know you have concerns.
What happened yesterday, to my man at the farm it was a terrible thing.
The dude getting his head blown off?
Yeah.
I've invited you into my home prepared food so we could sit and talk.
Discuss what's going on in this business our business, like men.
And I will explain everything that is happening.
I will answer your questions.
But first I need you to answer one question for me.
Can you cook Walter's formula?
What?
Walter's formula.
Can you produce his product without any help?
Alone.
No.
Why?
You're asking me if I can cook Mr. white's crystal?
Without him?
Me?
The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago.
This your plan?
Invite me in your house, make whatever this is be my buddy and make me feel important.
Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. white?
You wanna...
You wanna talk like men?
Let's talk like men.
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
That is not what I asked you.
You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
And I need your help.
I need you to help prevent an all-out war.
Now, if you would answer the question.
Hey, you headed out?
Yeah.
Yo, Mr. White, hey.
I really gotta talk to you.
I don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important so I'm hoping you could come over.
Thank God.
Come on in.
- You...
You want a beer or something?
- No.
- Should I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, go ahead.
Okay, so...
Okay, so word has come down that they...
They want me to go to Mexico.
There's some...
Some sort of war brewing...
- ...between Gus and the cartel.
- "Word has come down"?
The cartel has been...
Has been messing with Gus' operation.
Like jacking trucks to, like, send a message.
And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
I mean, they shot him right in front of me.
Just blew his head open.
Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
Anyway, they've been holding them off.
But between the cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.
So, Gus is...
ls gonna cave.
So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.
Well, I...
I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to...
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever and they got like actual chemists like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you.
And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English?
You know?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, if I mess this up I'm dead, you know?
All of us.
Mr. white, look, I need...
I need your help.
Okay, maybe you could...
Maybe you could coach me or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.
Mr. white?
So you saw Gus?
What?
No.
- You didn't see Gus.
- No.
Then who told you all of that?
It was passed down, like I said.
"Passed down." By whom?
By...
By Mike and them.
- I mean, they did.
They...
- So "they" doesn't include Gus.
You haven't been with Gus.
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.
- Why are you...?
- You weren't at Gus' house last night.
What?
What the hell?
Jesus.
Still here.
- It's still here.
- Jesus.
You look me in the eye and you tell me that you weren't at his house last night.
L...
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?
Okay?
I knew you would react this way.
I knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
What was I supposed to do, poison myself?
Two hours, 18 minutes, you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him?
- He never left the room.
- You lying little shit!
You had one thing to do, one thing.
That is the only thing, I might add, that would save our lives and you were right there.
You were in his house and you didn't have the guts to do it.
Two hours and 18 minutes?
You never had any intention of killing him, did you?
How did you know I was at his house last night?
Were you following me?
This.
This is how I knew.
- You bugged my car?
- 7:10 to 9:28 p.m.
Two hours and 18 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?
Not the slightest intention.
Everything that I have done for you.
You put a bug on my car?
I'm sorry, after everything you've done for me?
What you've done for me?
You killed me, is what you've done!
You've signed my death warrant!
Now you want advice?
I'll give you advice:
Go to Mexico and screw up like I know you will.
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!
You son of a...
Can you walk?
Yeah.
Then get the fuck out of here and never come back.

- Riley.
- What's up, Orlando?
Time for you to turn around, man.
- I'm just here to get paid.
- Me too.
But, you see, tonight
I'm taking everything.
Riley, bail!
Make no mistake.
Buying a car or coping a plea.
Deal-making is a blood sport.
When a witness lands in my doorstep, he's trading in his testimony his hometown and everyone he ever knew for a life at the end of the road.
So I set him up...
A new name, address, a job we hope he won't hate.
But the one thing I can't give him.
the deal I've yet to strike, is the one that protects him from the guy in the mirror.
Well, what if I don't testify?
Get word to the Bahamian cartel that I'll just keep my mouth shut.
You could do that.
Then you'd lose your immunity.
Do 10 to 15 for Grand Theft Auto, and spend the rest of your incarcerated life looking over your shoulder for a rastafarian with a shank.
Life's gonna be less fun.
That's our WITSEC motto.
And so it begins.
An idiotic Greek philosopher once said...
"Nothing endures but change."
But any WITSEC inspector on the job longer than a week will tell you, it's resistance to change that truly endures.
We cling to the life raft of who we are, even as the pounding sound of waterfalls grow louder in our ears.
Half a sub?
Thanks.
- What?
- What?
You know what.
Look, I'm working on it!
I shouldn't have to remind you, Mary.
It's too conspicuous.
We have to fly below the radar.
- Just like the witnesses.
- What's the matter, Stan?
Got muscle car envy?
So happens back when I was working warrants,
I drove a '69 GTO Judge.
I was Vin Diesel before Vin Diesel was Vin Diesel.
You know Vin's a chrome dome by choice, right?
But when I got promoted to WITSEC, I had to move on.
- It's time to move on, Mary.
- Look, I loved my old car.
- Ah, the probe.
- I miss the probe.
I never thought I'd get attached to this muscle car.
Turns out I'm more superficial than I thought.
The 'stang is too identifiable.
Yeah.
I said 'stang.
And if you become too identifiable, you not only put your witnesses in danger, Mary, but your partner.
Apparently, the 'stang is putting me in danger, Mary.
It so happens all I care about is the well-being of my partner.
- I'm impressed.
- With what?
You seem to be following a direct order.
I always follow a direct order.
Unless, you know, it's stupid.
I'm also impressed you seem to be rolling with change.
It's not something at which you're adept.
Hey, I'm adept at change.
I mean, did I not go on vacation with Faber?
No one, inuding me, thought I could vacate, and I vacated.
And during your so-called vacation, you convinced Faber to go make things work with his ex-wife and kids, which proves my thesis that you prefer a known situation that's deeply flawed to an unknown situation potentially free of flaws.
You're obviously adept at being wrong.
I'm all about change.
Oh, man, it's the same color!
Angry aubergine.
I searched for it far and wide, found it at a used car dealer in Resolute, Kentucky.
Dealer didn't wanna sell it because he said he believed in God and he was sure it was a sin to make money off this-- and I'm quoting--
"Chariot of Satan."
It has 140,000 miles on it!
- It's road tested, durable.
- Or seen through another lens, a candidate for the junkyard.
Look, Mary, there's no reason for you to regress back into a probe.
- Let me put you in a new loaner.
- The only reason
I'm back in the probe is Mr. Headroom here.
The probe is a known situation that is deeply flawed.
Or, seen through another lens, bite me.
Oh, look at this...
Gorgeousness!
Oh, man!
When that car comes back to me, and it will, please consider a new model.
You'd be doing me a favor, 'cause I wouldn't have to worry about getting sideways with God.
Hi, Marshall.
Hi, Mary.
You believe Peter found you that old wreck?
- I know.
- Honey...
I need the keys.
Sold.
Easy as "abc"-- always be closing'.
This is too easy.
You got a deal!
- Peter--
- Before you say anything,
I wanna show you something.
Brandi has climbed to number five on the big sales board.
Technically, I would classify that as a petite sales board.
- But--
- She's a natural at it.
She knows a hell of a lot about cars.
Yeah, well, she should.
She's a--
Has always loved all motor vehicles.
Brandi is making her own money and feeling really good about herself, so big favor-- just don't "Mary" the situation.
What--what does that mean?
"Mary" the situation?
Perhaps it means speaking the unfiltered harsh truth when a respectful silence might be more appropriate.
Okay, all right, first of all, don't turn my name into a verb.
Look, I'm just--I'm trying to warn you, Peter.
Brandi gets distracted.
Easily.
Just don't expect her to stay on your petite sales board for long.
You know what's hard to acknowledge?
Your little sister's growing up.
Brandi's changed.
Hey, hey--he'll be the first to confirm this.
I'm all about change.
I just don't know that she's capable of it.
Peter, every time my little sister's gotten a new life path or--or boyfriend or job, it ends in disaster.
Or a word that sounds less harsh but means the same thing.
- Pete, we got a problem.
- I'll be there in a minute.
This can't wait.
Six cars were stolen off the back lot.
What?
This is me being respectfully silent.
Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
And that is...
Somebody wants them dead.
Brendan, good to see you!
Coffee?
Hello, Tim!
Got you some coffee.
- Mike?
- Hey.
It's really good to see you.
They stole two Audis, two Porches, two Mercedes.
What, are they building an ark?
So they can steal six cars, and they can't open a gate.
Why does everyone but me feel this crushing need to be liked?
You find that an inherent weakness?
And you made this snap judgment based on a woman bringing her coworkers coffee?
My snap judgment, which some would call seasoned law enforcement instincts, tells me that any female detective who has to play the "ooh, look at me,
"I'm wearing porno eye shadow and bringing you hot beverages" card isn't clearing many cases.
Come on.
You don't think she's working just a little too hard?
Well, Marshal Marshall Mann!
What is a federal lawman doing working a local Grand Theft Auto?
You may not know that the Judiciary Act of 1789 gives federal marshals 50-State jurisdiction to execute all lawful precepts, and... to command all necessary assistance in the execution of their duty.
Hello, Mary Shannon!
Abigail Chaffee.
Coffee?
- How is it--
- That I know you?
Albuquerque's not that big a town.
- So why is it--
- You don't know me?
Well, I am the new girl from the great Republic of Texas.
- Hook 'em horns.
- Lord, no!
Our family is four generations SMU.
Go, Mustangs.
Mr. Alpert, do you have security camera coverage?
No.
The cameras don't pick up this back part of the lot.
That's why we have the giant, impenetrable gate.
Keys missing?
All the cars were keyless entry, but the key fobs are still in the lockbox, and the GPS antitheft systems never pinged at the satellite.
I'm gonna need employment records of everyone who ever worked here.
Don't think it was one of my guys.
Most of them have been with me for years.
And one or more of them helped steal six of your cars.
Is there anything you need to tell me?
Mary!
Okay.
Your non-answer's less comforting than you might think.
So typical of you to think that this has anything to do with me.
I'm sorry.
All those with
Grand Theft Auto convictions in their past, please raise your hand.
That's ancient history.
Teenage stuff.
You think the cops'll see it that way?
Okay.
This cannot be happening.
So I'm asking you again.
Brandi...
Did someone convince you to help them with this?
Why would I help somebody steal cars from my own dealership?
Okay, look.
I've been known to screw things up with guys.
Fine.
But you draw bad men to you like an electron magnet.
You do.
Not this time.
No.
I finally have a good man and a job that I really like, and I rock at it.
So please, I have to make sure
Peter doesn't find out about my GTA conviction.
Look, he already knows about a suitcase full of meth and a murder conviction.
Why would he care about an ex-boyfriend's car you took for a joyride in--in high school?
It's just...
He can't find out--not now.
I don't want him to regret his decision.
His decision to hire a car thief to sell cars?
This decision.
Huh.
Sparkly.
I wanted to tell you over drinks tonight.
I don't wear it at work, because I sell more cars if guys think that I'm single.
How come you don't look happy for me?
I'd be blowing champagne bubbles out of my ass if I wasn't absolutely certain that you're gonna be arrested for Grand Theft Auto.
Brandi, listen to me.
You need to tell me exactly what happened so I can try to help you.
Mary, I know my credibility is shot with you, but nothing happened.
So please...
A lot of good things are happening for me right now, and I do not want it all ruined.
Could you...
make some calls?
Find out who did this.
Please.
You know people.
As you saw in the posting, we're looking to promote and train a deputy marshal for WITSEC, which I like to think of as the elite branch of the Marshal Service.
That's what they say at FIST.
Wow.
FIST.
Yeah.
Those fugitive investigative strike team guys know how to pick a sexy acronym, don't they?
They sure garner a lot of flashy headlines, but we're not really in the flashy headline business, just the business of protecting witnesses whose testimony puts away hundreds of more criminals than sexy-acronymic FIST could ever dream of.
What are you doing?
Uh, your desk accessories were misaligned.
Hmm.
Let me ask you something, deputy Eberhardt.
Oh.
Don't pronounce the "T".
Excuse me?
It's Eberhard.
Silent "t".
Got it.
Yes?
Stan.
Marshall and I need to go off the grid.
Brandi got herself jammed up again.
Anything I can do to help?
Say yes?
I want to use one of my witnesses as a consultant.
Mary, that's thin WITSEC ice.
So that's a yes?
There is precedent.
We work that way with some of Cosa Nostra boys, but Mary, your personal life
- with your witness, it's...
- I know, I know.
Church and State.
Jesus, I'm not a retard.
Sorry, deputy Eberhardt.
Uh...
Eberhard.
Right.
We're looking for team members with high levels of flexibility.
How would you deal with-- oh, say for instance-- a difficult, overbearing coworker who might tend to be a bit acidy or snide?
I detest discord in the work environment.
We'll be in touch.
You're back in the probe and off on a mission on which we have no investigative jurisdiction to protect your little sister.
Where have I seen this movie before?
Two dates.
I seem to have bypassed the conversational off-ramp.
Nancy Drew, teen detective.
She touched your forearm, laughed at your inane factoid.
My operational theory is that you've had two dates, and the jeans haven't hit the floor yet.
Have I mentioned that I admire your fierce advocacy for your sister?
I am wondering, however, if we're on this quixotic mission to help clear your sister, in the event she's innocent, or to confirm your belief that she's not.
And your conversational bypass tells me that I'm exactly right-- you still haven't slept with little miss "I just got my braces off."
Seriously, Marshall, you want a side of red sports car to go with that midlife crisis?
- Your claws are showing.
- They don't retract.
I gotta tell you, I am both annoyed and impressed that you kept this little relationship a secret from me.
Keeping secrets is part and parcel of our chosen profession.
Only the cheerleader doesn't seem your type.
I defy you to categorize the women I've dated as belonging to one specific type.
If anyone, it is you who has a deeply ingrained pattern
- to your romantic involvements.
- Right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Dominican ball player and divorcee FBI agent.
- Peas in a pod, those two.
- Both Raph and Faber believe that no matter how tough and independent a woman is, underneath it all, she wants a white picket fence and 2.5 kids.
That's why you didn't marry Raph and Faber went back to sort things out with his ex-wife and 2.5 kids.
What are you saying--my type is guys that don't get me?
In point of fact, your type is guys that you don't get don't get you.
But this only applies to long-term relationships.
Short-term, you will-- your words, not mine-- drop jeans with just about anyone.
What?
Oh...
I see.
Okay.
Sorry.
So you're pissy 'cause I called Nancy Drew a cheerleader.
I'm sorry, Marshall.
I'm sorry.
I was wrong--very wrong.
It's been three dates.
Riley?
Wow.
You look like crap.
Thanks.
Look, I didn't boost six rides.
And if I did, believe me,
I wouldn't be sitting here wiping crud off a golf cart battery.
How'd you know about the cars?
I have a police scanner.
Brings me back.
- Miss it?
- Look around.
- What do you think?
- Look, for the record, we never thought you had anything to do with the thefts.
- They're not your style.
- So you're visiting to tell me the Bahamian cartel no longer wants me dead?
- I can leave the program?
- No, that's not why I'm here.
I wish it were.
I need a favor.
It's vehicular.
All right.
I'll help you guys out with the thefts.
For a small finder's fee, of course.
But I need a favor from you first.
It's medical.
So, uh, thank that doctor for the WITSEC family discount.
Sure.
I never thought I'd be the guy needing the happy pills.
Half the world's on them.
Join the masses.
You?
Probably not.
Look at me.
You know, I...
I don't know how this happened to me.
It's like...
I used to roll out of bed, ready to go, and now I have trouble waking up or even caring if I do wake up.
Am I supposed to tear up because you're not stealing cars anymore?
No.
All right.
What if one day you couldn't be a marshal?
What if one day all that adrenaline just... vanished?
All right.
I guess I feel a little sorry for you.
- Thanks.
- So...
Riley.
How does someone steal six cars?
There's 50 ways those cars coulda been stolen.
Back before I needed these,
I used to romance the cars away.
These days, every luxury car has a different keyless entry and ignition system.
Now, any teenager can hop on the Internet and download some code-grabbing software that opens up the car and starts 'em up.
But that's only the second hardest part of boosting the ride.
Don't keep a girl waiting.
The GPS antitheft system.
When you press the key fob, the GPS sends a signal up to a satellite.
Even when the car's turned off, the manufacturer can ping the car.
The way you're gonna solve these thefts, figure out how the car crew disabled the antitheft system.
Unless they were a really top shelf crew, they had to have somebody on the inside.
You know, if you want, I can go over to the dealership,
- pop my head in--
- No.
No, okay?
Do not.
No catnip for kitty.
I just needed your larcenous expertise.
I hope it helped.
Mm.
Someone you know get jammed up for this?
What?
No.
Why?
Why else would a WITSEC inspector be involved?
Sometimes I have to do an immediate relocation on a witness, and there's no time to pack a bag.
So... here.
I'm sad.
I'm not homeless.
Then dress like it.
And shave.
- And shower.
- Hint received.
Thanks for the info.
Thanks for, uh...
for everything.
That meal was delicious.
Well, I am an expert at watching the food network and downloading the recipes.
It's the...
actual cooking part that I'm not so sure about yet, so...
Let me see how the ring looks on you.
Ooh!
Did Peter tell you that I helped him pick it out?
- What?
- Thanks, mom.
I was trying to create the impression
- that I'm the one with taste.
- Sorry.
Full disclosure?
I kind of had a hunch that your mom was behind this, so... thank you, dora.
You wear it well.
Welcome to the family, Brandi.
- Cheers.
- I like it.
I like it.
Hal, thanks.
Uh...
Things were a bit rocky in my house growing up, and... well, I just don't know how I got so lucky to meet Peter and the two of you, so...
Well, you know you're joining a very close-knit family.
Dora and I feel like Peter and his sister is the reason we were put on this earth.
I'm sure your parents feel the same way about you.
Which is why, in the spirit of full disclosure,
I think you should take a look at this.
- Dad...
- No, look through it.
It's just a little security blanket.
It's a prenup.
And this is an ambush.
Mom, please tell me you didn't know about this.
Look, darling, this is--it's--it's-- it's not personal.
It's just about your business and your father's.
Mom, it's not just about business when you say you don't trust my fiancee, and by extension, you don't trust me.
Did some other parents sit with you in family therapy?
Did they come visit you in rehab, clean up your vomit, not know if their son was gonna live another day?
Please--okay.
Peter, this is--
I don't want to come between you and your family.
That's fine, 'cause my parents were just leaving
- and never coming back.
- Peter!
I used to drink.
But at the bottom of the hole I dug for myself,
I never hurt anyone this badly, and more importantly,
Brandi's never done anything to betray your trust.
Brandi Shannon?
Albuquerque police.
Miss Shannon, will you come with us, please?
Oh, great.
Everyone's here to pick up the inside man.
Got this.
I'm assuming you have concrete evidence linking my sister to this crime, otherwise, I'm not clear why you dragged her in here for questioning.
Questioning is how we gather evidence.
I'm sure you're aware of her Grand Theft Auto conviction.
15 years ago, because of a high school dirt bag boyfriend.
And her jacket has some more recent activity.
Suspect in a murder investigation?
Because of a different dirt bag boyfriend.
- Sensing a pattern?
- What makes you think there isn't another dirt bag in the picture maybe at the dealership?
Detective, this was a sophisticated crime.
You can accuse my sister of many things-- sophistication isn't one of them.
Please tell me you have more realistic suspects.
You know I can't discuss the investigation with you, but as you are a friend of the department,
I can tell you Brandi is a person of interest.
Oh, person of interest.
You know, she's not an astronaut or a research scientist, so don't pretty it up with police blotter spin-- just say it.
She's a suspect.
You're protecting your sister.
I would do the same.
But fair warning-- I'm not letting anyone get in the way of my investigation.
Good.
Got it.
Fair warning-- my little sister's not getting railroaded.
Brandi, the police don't have anything except your record.
It doesn't matter.
Your parents are now convinced that you're engaged to a car thieving gold digger.
I don't know how to make this clearer.
I don't care what my parents think.
The only way I could have appeared more white trash is if the police had tackled me on an astroturf lanai in front of a double-wide.
Look, you can be as angry at my parents as you want.
I'm on your side.
Your fiancee is telling you
I don't think you're a car thief, and I don't think you're white trash, and if you are, so am I, and I'm buying us both a double-wide.
You can't see where this is headed, can you?
I'm hoping home.
Here.
This should save your parents all of the hard work of splitting us up.
- Bran--
- Hey.
I got this.
A million dollars.
That's right.
If the marriage ended before five years.
More if it went longer.
Wow.
That is...
Awesome.
- Mary--
- What?
I mean...
If a marriage starts out like a deal, then that's what it is.
- It's a deal.
- It's a marriage contract.
It's a deal.
When I was sitting there with Peter's parents,
I would have signed it just to keep the peace.
But I thought about it, what it all means and...
If I sign it, that means that I'm somebody that they need legal protection from, like I am who they think I am.
Squish, look at us.
I mean, honestly.
Mom spent most of her life looking through the bottom of a Canadian Club bottle.
Dad robbed banks and parachuted out on us.
I mean, you got hooked up with a meth dealer who tried to kill me, and I've made pushing good men away an art form.
So maybe we are who the Alberts think we are.
Who cares?
I'm changing.
I can see your face, you know.
I'm right here.
I realize that I've said I'm changing probably so many times that it seems comical to you.
But think about this, okay?
I mean, what would I have done before?
I would have signed that prenup and taken the prize money.
All right, so what's the problem?
Peter doesn't want you to sign it, and he still wants to marry you, right?
Win-win.
Except it would end Peter's relationship
- with his parents.
- Yeah, but he's a big boy.
- That's his problem.
- No, what?
And...
Start our life out with huge regrets?
What if we have kids, Mary?
What, are they not gonna see their grandparents?
I mean, don't you get it?
In the long-term, Peter's gonna end up resenting me.
So what's the long-term plan, then?
You're back here with me instead of with Peter?
Gotta say, I'm not a big fan of the long-term strategy.
God, Mary.
Same old stuff, right?
Brandi screws up and comes back to stay in your guest room?
Well, I didn't screw up this time, and if you can't see that, then maybe you need to look in the mirror.
Maybe you're the one who needs to change.
Good night.
There's no bed in there.
I know.
Mom took it for her new place.
It's a... junk room now.
Sorry.
Okay.
Thanks.
We'll be there in 20 minutes.
Got something.
Tess Yates over at the FBI did some digging.
She came up with a GTA investigation in Oklahoma City.
Matches the MO of Peter's dealership.
And you know what Oklahoma City and Albuquerque have in common?
I-40.
They have suspects?
Two Samoans that run a car crew.
Yates is gonna show us what she has.
I think Washington wants us to say pacific islanders.
Yeah.
That's gonna happen.
Jesus.
Why does Stan wanna hire a new inspector?
We're understaffed.
Yeah, but new people?
They're all... new.
What's with Bill Gates in there?
Before I joined the marshals,
I got a degree from the Naval School of Computer Science.
That's very impressive, but here at WITSEC we don't rely much on computers.
Are you saying I'm a better fit for FIST?
No.
I'm saying that this department focuses more on people skills.
A-are you saying you don't think I'm cut out for FIST?
Uh...
'Scuse me for sec, will you?
How's it going with Brandi?
She's a person of interest.
- I hate that phrase.
- Don't get me started.
Headed over to meet Yates.
Wanna join?
Can't.
Keep me updated.
That's an order.
Brandi.
Brandi.
God, I'm so glad you're back.
- Just to do my job.
- Okay.
- Can we talk?
- Employee to boss.
Fiance to fiancee?
Did you apologize to your parents?
Apologize to them for what?
For saying that they should leave and never come back.
They need to apologize to us.
I'm not breaking up your family, Peter.
I know what it's like.
Trust me.
Sales agent needed on the floor.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I have an up.
Well, hey, there.
- Hi.
I'm Brandi.
- Riley.
Riley!
Uh...
let's skip the sedans.
We're gonna go straight to sports cars.
- You like this one?
- Does anyone say no?
Don't even bother looking at the sticker price,
- because this one's a steal.
- We'll see.
This meeting's officially unofficial, correct?
Correct.
Oh, boy.
Please tell me when we look at the dealership security video, we see these two nimrods checking out cars, preferably not with my sister.
You won't get that lucky.
We only got tipped off to the Tatupo brothers from an informant who used to work in their crew.
Any way you could unofficially contact the informant for us?
I would be glad to, but I'd have to be able to commune with the dead.
I brought afternoon muffins.
Are you more of a bran or a blueberry?
Is anyone bran, really?
Oh, I am.
They clean me right out.
Blueberry for me, thank you.
Thank you.
- So... deputy Parmalee--
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
Let me know if that bothers you, because I do that a lot.
But the deputy marshal network thrives on gossip, so I know you're having difficulties finding someone to train for WITSEC.
These days, seems everyone's interested in FIST.
- Well, that's not really--
- And the scuttlebutt.
That's a funny word, scuttlebutt-- is you're having a problem finding someone who can get along with Mary Shannon, so--and I'm not going to take no for an answer-- I want to come back
for a second interview with you and Mary.
I don't see that happening.
You see, you're kind of sunny-- a quality I admire, by the way, but Mary is...
less so.
You're the chief inspector in this office, right?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Then you'll make it happen.
I never for a moment considered applying to FIST.
Riley really have new info, or is he angling for a belgium waffle?
Said he has some ideas about how a car crew might have-- his words, not mine-- boosted the rides.
Probably the waffle.
What?
You're doing the "not so good news" face.
Message from Abigail.
Security video has confirmed your sister was the last one out of the dealership that night.
Why's Abigail telling you that?
'Cause I asked.
Wow.
Still waters.
Does the security video show Brandi committing any crimes?
- None.
- So?
Coincidence.
- A lot of 'em.
- Stop making the face.
Look, if Brandi's involved it's because she was taken advantage of by some douche bag guy.
It's the Brandi Shannon story.
Oh, my lord.
- What's up?
- It's amazing.
I own exactly the same suit.
I think I was crystal clear-- no, I'm sure I was crystal clear.
I asked you how those cars were stolen.
I didn't ask you to steal a car.
- Now I have to arrest you.
- Arrest me?
- You're gonna thank me.
- For what?
- For stealing a $150,000 car?
- Look, I know you told me not to go down to the dealership, but I had to figure out how the car crew did it.
It's a point of professional pride.
So you stole one for yourself.
This blond sales chick-- smokin' hot, by the way-- she practically begged me to steal the car.
She made it so easy.
This dealership was full of security leaks.
I got the ignition and entry code in 30 seconds.
She kept her password...
on a post-it.
Jersey girl.
Oh, and this.
- Old gum?
- Lead putty.
I found it on the ground where the cars were stolen.
They put that on the GPS antenna.
Totally blocks the satellite signal.
So the blond was probably the inside person in the crew?
No way.
Too ditzy.
Rippin' body, though.
Smokin' hot.
- Yeah.
No.
You said.
- I think that they were taking the cars someplace where they were warehousing snowplows.
- Snowplows?
- Yeah.
You see the salt in there?
Looks like road salt.
It's not road salt.
Could possibly be...
You didn't put the lead putty in the car you took, did you?
- Move.
- You protect your witness.
- Go, go, go!
- I'll deal with the law.
- Check the car.
- Car's clear!
There's no one in the car, ma'am.
I'm gonna check around back.
- Hands in the air!
- Freeze!
Stand down, gentlemen.
So have you turned to a life of crime?
Just helping clear the name of an innocent person of interest.
I'm beginning to wonder if I've picked the right boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
Is it official now?
It's been witnessed by three sworn officers of the law.
Now, do you wanna tell me why you stole this vehicle?
So I could solve your case.
Of course you minored in Geology.
With all the time you two spend together, how did you not know that?
'Cause nobody knows what anyone minored in.
- Marshall, what'd I minor in?
- Jagermeister?
- Oh.
I stand corrected.
- Salado Mesa is basically an effacement of salts, salado translating roughly as "salty."
The Mesa Salt Company was one of the largest salt producers in the world until the Pakistanis began dominating the industry.
If I fall asleep at the wheel, it's on you.
I am, however, very interested.
To the north of the property is the original Mesa Salt mine.
To the South is the last mine built before the factory ceased operations.
I figured either would be an ideal place to hide a chop shop.
And either location could account for the large, unrefined salt granules found in the lead putty.
I enjoy your theory.
But I have spent too many hours in my unmarked following down leads that go nowhere.
You are gonna owe me big-time for taking personal time to track down this lead.
What, exactly,
- did you have in mind?
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna hurl.
What did Mary say?
- She said she's going to hurl.
- Don't hurl, Mary.
I'll check out the north.
You two take the South.
Copy that.
If there was a mine here, it caved in a long time ago.
Maybe you're a better marshal than you are a detective.
The jury is still out, actually.
It looks like we've got something here in the South side.
Give us a second.
We've got some tire tracks.
Could be off-roaders or--
Marshall?
Maybe not.
Marshall...
Marshall talk to me!
Taking fire!
Call for backup!
Shots fired off Salado Mesa Road.
Mile marker 39.
- Those guys are huge.
- That gun is huge.
Make sure you save one bullet.
- For what?
- So you can kill my sister.
It'd be weird for me to do it.
She had nothing to do with the Tatupo brothers.
The only time people shoot at me is because of Brandi.
You gave Riley my suit from the operation suitcase.
How is that pertinent at this moment?
Just in case we...
I wanted you to know that I knew.
Aah!
- Okay!
Out of the car!
- U.S. Marshals!
U.S. Marshal!
Put your hands up!
- Through the sunroof!
- Put your hands up!
Through the sunroof!
Hands up!
- Chaffee, you all right?
- They got me.
Oh, God!
Look, I...
Guess I was kind of a douche down at the station, so... you know.
Don't die or anything.
You were very douchey, Mary.
But I accept your apology.
I didn't...
apologize.
What?
Ahem.
Mary, what are you doing?
Well...
I want you off my sofa.
My father's basic theory-- you look lovely, by the way-- is that everyone's out to screw you.
I don't wanna live my life like that.
But I still apologized to him.
Uh...
I'm confused.
Why?
Brandi thought it was important.
Peter, no.
I don't want your parents to think I married you for the money.
Sorry.
Confused again.
You said if you signed that, it would confirm you're the person his parents thought you were or some... crap like that.
I decided to change their minds.
Long-term thinking.
And worst-case scenario--
- You get the cool mil.
- Ignoring her.
So am I.
I just want our kids to know their grandparents.
You know, now that we're a family again,
I think I want my Mustang back.
Just curious.
Who'd you tell Peter the finder's fee was for?
He didn't ask.
- Sap
- He's a good man.
If you like polite, stable rich guys.
Which we know is not your type.
Please tell me we haven't seduced him back into a life of crime.
- You showing off again, so help--
- Please chill.
I got a better job.
Thank you.
I'll see you soon, Riley.
Yes, you will.
Well... guess those pills really worked, huh?
Never had to take 'em.
You asked me to consult, gave me the cheap suit, got me the test drive with the smokin' hot saleswoman, and now I'm back in the high-end rides.
You're my happy pill, Mary.
Hey, what do you know?
You hear that?
That suit happens to have been a bespoke wool gabardine.
Okay.
Come on.
Okay.
Excuse me a moment, please.
You two think I don't have stroke with APD?
That I wouldn't find out about an officer-involved shooting that included two U.S. Marshals?
- Okay, look--
- I ordered you to check in.
What happened to Church and State, Mary, hmm?
Stan, we were taking a stab in the dark.
You know what?
Don't speak.
- Stan--
- No, shhzz!
You're not speaking.
We're at the dawn of a new era, Mary, where my word is law.
Is that understood?
Is it?
You told us not to speak.
The time for being childish has passed.
So... as the first edict of the new era, our newly promoted Deputy Marshal for WITSEC-- miss Delia Parmalee.
Really?
I know something that will turn that frown upside down.
Morning muffins.
Stan, you can't be serious.
Oh, thinking of making some type of twisted joke, Mary?
- Come on.
- Hmm?
It so happens that deputy Parmalee graduated first in her class.
Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
That's something no one here but marshal
- can lay claim to.
- These are delicious.
Thank you.
They're cappuccino with espresso cream frosting.
- Come on, Stan.
- New regime, Mary.
"We know what we are but know not what we may be."
Don't talk like that.
What's your point?
Your mom is well-ensconced teaching ballet, your sister's engaged.
And, despite your underlying belief in her guilt, it turned out she was free of any complicity in the car theft.
My question is...
What does the protective lioness do without anyone to protect?
Whether it's secrets, justice or the Amazon rainforest, everyone of us protects things a thousand times a day.
It doesn't take a gun.
For most of us, protection is as quiet and reflexible as a breath.
For some, though.
for knights in shiny armor, the Lone Ranger, a boyfriend or a Mom.
protection can be a hard habit to break.
As much as we thump the Bible about the vital need to change, the fact is, we hardly ever do.
We stay here, halfway to happiness.
In our old familiar places, with our feet stuck firmly on the ground.
The flying molar was last seen over--
Idiot.

I do not know, to me this all sounds weird .
Something happened Diego?
Pascual saw you in my office.

Do not tell anyone, but tonight boxing will be in the village.
Should just accept me.
- You're going to fight?
- I will win.
Senor Molins, what does this outfit?
- And where are you going?
- The cantaloa-i'm pub.
Bet.
And prefer to go that way.
If ordinary clothes to go, sure kihasználnának.
I thought I came to the hotel to rest, senor Molins.
I'm disappointed in you.
That's not why I came, but I can not avoid it.
You are full of surprises.
What an adventurer.
I'll take that as a compliment.
If you'll excuse me.
Not anywhere stolen.
Can not sure that someone had been there?

Judging from their bets
I think there are smarter ways to win more money.
I would like to ask all of Juli hours.
Okay.
- What you wanted, is not it?
- Yes.
But now lose.
- What?
- Take care so as not to be conspicuous but lose.
If you will not have to fight anymore .

May I ask, what are you doing here?
What's he doing in your room?
Why did you take the dolgozószobámból ?
Did that help you with accounts, as well as my father, and...

- Went into my office again?
You made me to do it.
I thought idly by and watch subversive to my room and lie?
I thought I was stupid and did not I realize that hiding something from me?
I think you sent me?
Alicia is one of the guests.
Someone threatened him and turned to me for help.
- And who is it?
- I can not tell.
Diego, if you want to get this to work must trust each other.
Don Anselmóról, the musician is.
I have not said before, because I did not want to mix in such a case.
What did Don Anselmo with the maid?
- Diego.
- He claims to anything.
But can not afford a scandal therefore asked me for help.
I trust you, I swear.
But you also have to trust me.
Let me do I solve this.
And can never forgive myself if something happens to you dangerous.
It will be our secret.
Your mother does not find out.
Come on, come on!
More, more, more!
What is going on here?
You said you will lose.
Lose.
Yes!
That's it!
More, more!
Yes!
Done for you, you and your friend can !
Kirúgatsz If your mother will know where you've been , magyarázkodhatsz and where did you get the money what you've asked.
It will not be gone.
- Fighting gone.
- I assure you, not by choice.
Let me then.
- What happened?
- I do not know whether we should say.
I thought you do not already, you should , but what you want.
I think your sister's dress had blackmail.
- Extortion?
- One of the guests, Don Anselmo.
The dog person?
He killed my sister?
I do not know.
But something happened that night and threaten to figure out.
- How do you know?
- I found an anonymous letter.
It seems that the blackmailer knows what happened, and money required to keep quiet in return.
And you know where to get a transfer?
Tomorrow at noon at the intersection.
I will not have to go it alone.
How come you will not let me go alone ?
Because this is the hotel of my father, my hotel.
And some serious stuff going on here, and I want to know what it is.
Anyway, better know the forest, like you.
My sister had lost I do not want something to happen...
I can take care of myself.
Maybe even better than you.
Come.
- ... I guess you're the detective
- Detective Ayala,
The Supervisory Body.
- Hernando agent.
I'm glad you're here.
I'll go to your final destination.
Why not attempt more to the body?
I did not come here on vacation.
What terrible.
A young girl in a place.
Cantaloában up to theft or fights you're dealing nothing of the sort.
First, when dissecting a body never done uncoated wood.
Decomposition of organic matter and the body prevent the autopsy.
If they can not take place metal,
I do not know vizsgálhatnának bodies.
As I said, we usually do not dissect corpses.
I thought.
I read your report.
Cause of death was a wound caused by pointing weapon .
In this we agree.
But...
- has not been determined what kind of weapon.
- I mentioned in the report...
As I said, I read the report.
I know that no murderer has been prepared by the weapon, but theories can be manufactured.
If I may be bold
I think it was a knife or dagger.
A pocket knife is too small to cause cuts such , a sword is too big.
Anyway...
- who is now the sword?
- Farmers living around here,
- who have sickle...
- a much more characteristic sickle cause wound.
So it can be excluded.
And is not it a clean szúrásról talking about.
Many small cut is wound around suggesting that the culprit is difficult pulled out the gun.
It can be concluded that the weapon and stabbed bone
In such cases sometimes...
Gentlemen, it was argued that it is not the murder weapon ?
Wrong again.
It appears this is fiercely...
gold.
Poor people live here, sir.
Is one place where you can knife gold.
Barely slept because of the dog, Andrés.
It's a wonder I can even stand.
I'm sorry.
I think you need a lot of rest, just back entrusted with Don Benjamin
- but now they go.
- I hope so.
- Belén.
- What Andrés?
- Something I want to ask you.
- I can not, Andrés, a lot of things to do.
Is it?
Me to come with her?
- It's almost noon.
- I'll take Don Anselmo.
- Something I'm trying to get it out of him.
- Be careful.
- Do not worry.
- The garden of Budapest, near the lake.
- You asked for coffee?
- No!
But it really is not bad.
How are the dogs?
Slept well?
Yes, sir.
I think much better than we do.
The electric light is very good for reading.
Great invention.
I not sure he is a lack of candles or gas lighting.
Sure was very impressive when suddenly illuminated the hotel.
I speak.
Not participated in the Festival of Lights?
Doña Teresa invited me, but I just concert in Barcelona.
It's a shame.
Yes, it is a pity.
Here's the coffee.
Yes?
I hope the money is already initialized.
You better be accurate .
I do not have the money.
What happened?
I lost the line, senor Murquía.
Do you wish to make a new call
Where the call?
The call came from inside the hotel there, sir .
Do you know anything about who spoke on the phone?
No, sir.
A lot of the things and people going in and out.
I need the money in the coffers hotel.
Yes, sir.
I got the money.
You're going to take him to the south.
Don Diego.
A gentleman wishes to see.
... And he says the police.
- Murquía Diego, director of the hotel.
- Detective Ayala the Supervisory Body.
I do not want to sound disrespectful, but I advised me to speak personally Doña Teresa.
- Did something happen?
- Doña Teresa, widow of Alarcón, the hotel owner.
With him.
Office immediately.
- This.
- Wait for me here.
Doña Teresa, the hotel owner.
- Madam, my name is...
- Detective Ayala the Supervisory Body.
And a village girl investigation of the murder.
- That's right.
- Do not be surprised.
Barreda judge said, a good friend of the family who is .
I see why you held on so many time to meet with you.
I do not want anything to interfere with the of our guests.
I promise I will.
I would like to talk to some employees, then rooms and belepillantanék register.
Only cselédségébe.
I also discreetly.
Would you tell me what this has to do with the murder at the hotel?
It was the murdered girl's body.
A golden knife tip.
Can you find out where they are gold dinnerware?
This is the sideboard, here are the greatest gift.
It seems that one is missing.
There is someone the keys to the cabinet?
This is the key and the key to the chamber I have only you.
And can marry anyone without your knowledge?
Not impossible, but not likely.
That only you could take away the knife.
I am 15 years of hotel fõpincére Detective
Professionalism is beyond all doubt, and I assure you that if you want to kill someone , not use a kit of the hotel.
So why miss one?
These are valuable pieces.
Whoever stole was not the first time.
Whether in the dining room, even his place.
And when he came out from the last knives?
Recently purified and checked the gold cutlery and dinnerware.
- One serving has helped.
- Who?
Julio Espinosa.
The young man serves here only recently.
Who was the lady?
A disreputable nõszemély.
Kindly speak normally.
If a woman is not fair, it probably is and ready to go.
The honor is as important as the good manners , especially when it comes to a murdered girl .
- Do you think it has to do with your sister?
- I do not know.
Andrés, I have to go.
Julio Espinosa?
Yes.
It is why I am here, I think not have to explain.
Recently helped Don Benjamin gold cutlery in order to do it?
Yes, that's right.
I'd like to talk to you.
If possible, something calmer place.
Sure.
This.
I did not take none of the cutlery and did not even know the girl.
And where was the eve of his death?
The pub cantaloa dated but soon returned.
My roommate, I can confirm it was .
None.
- There is something about me?
- No, there is nothing against you,
But there is nothing you next to nothing.
I'd appreciate it if you would not leave the hotel.
Rest assured, I will not.
Can I go now?
What happened?
I do not trust this Espinosában.
Search the room
Yes, sir, .
- I'll be here.
- Keep them up.
- Me?
How so?
- Use your dogs.
This is Señor Espinosa room.
And your son, I think.
Investigation gentlemen, may I ask what you are looking for a hotel ?
- The killer?
- I can not talk about
Move out of the way and take them the animals here, please
Sorry...
Sir, I'm sorry, you know, where the intersection is ?
There's nothing here, sir.
Half of strangers.
You said that Cristina Olmedo solved the issue.
Then this is the living image.
Now the police find the bloody clothes.
And do you really think that kivehetsz 50,000 pesetas in coffers so not notice?
Left my desk.
Someone knows what happened Cristina Olmedóval and blackmailed me.
Solve somehow.
I'm working on.
And it has never crashed.
I hope this will not be the first time.
Alicia!
Alicia!
Alicia!
Are you all right?
Good day.
I'm sorry, I know you?
My information there about the girl's death.
Seen something?
Shortly before his death, I saw someone.
Javier Alarcon.
After the jump...
- Don Javier Alarcon?
- What are you doing here?
I have come to question you, as a murder suspect.
- That night I was someone else.
- You know what we call the coincidences language of my profession?
Suspicion.
Right now, when we need it the most it, leave me down, Diego?
There was someone else.
- Who?
- Señorita Alicia.
I paid the blackmailer because know the truth.
Herein, wearing a robe, and tore runtime.
Espinosa, what are you doing here?
Then I found when Don Javier threw on his bed.
- Do you know someone else?
- No, ma'am.
Dr. Santamaría?
Doña Elisa, Don Alfredo's mother.
Certainly understands that you care about the health of my grandson and the title Marquis future.
Miss those pages that are dr.
Santamaría visits passed.
Careful.
Not good for the upper osztálybéliekkel play.
There will never be like them.
Wait a second.
The police wanted criminals, right?
- Well receive.
- Who?
Beware!
Do not touch it!
The breakfast, Don Diego.
Someone is blackmailing Don Diego to what happened Cristina.
He killed her.
All personnel inspect the room, but very discreetly.
If the person realizes that seek him, he will try to escape .
The ends of the earth was a place so deadly that shield from outside world.
Welcome...
To the bug jar...
Where monstrous creatures roam free...
Where a faceless ruler seeks escape to inflict his wrath upon humanity.
But now the great barrier is on the verge of failure...
And the hope of all mankind lies in the bravest, most capable of hands.
And, uh, speaking of hands, you've got four.
Think you could lend one?
Whoops.
Guys, what's the shield status?
Power regulator's completely trashed, doc.
I'll need to control it manually until I can get it started.
Mm.
Kind of ripe in here.
That little back door there not the bathroom.
More bug jar buddies.
I got the last one.
Fine.
Hold this.
And whatever you do, do not let go.
Or what?
Kaboom!
He will pay.
Okay, little wormie, come to papa.
Whoa.
Yet even in this forsaken place, our hero runs afoul of his evil Nemesis...
Van Kleiss.
♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪

Activating stealth suit.
Looks like Van Kleiss decided to crash the party.
Just like that guy not to phone ahead.
And he brought his pack flunkies.
Biowulf, Skalamander, Breach.
Circe?
Get ready.
They're headed straight for... someplace else.
Gonna find out where.
No way.
You're not leaving me here with your...
Sorry.
Another call.
Rex, why aren't you fixing that shield regulator?
Hint... you may remember him from such schemes as
"destroying Providence headquarters" and "trying to take over the entire earth."
Van Kleiss?
In there?
You're right.
You should investigate, after you fix the shield.
Then it might be too late.
- She's there, isn't she?
- Who, Breach?
Yeah, but...
A quick recon, and that's it.
I'll try to buy some time at this end.
And I want regular check-ins.
Yep.
Got it.
Intriguing.
An entire divergent branch of evo development.
This place is a waste of our time.
Van Kleiss knows what he's doing.
It's not your place to question.
Question?
You dare accuse me of disloyalty?
Hmm.
Sorry.
Get a grip.
With no care for his own safety, our brave hero tails his quarry into the very lion's den.
Unknown to the villain, he'll be meddling in forces he can't possibly control.
Circe, if you would?
Intruders!
Who are you?
Someone in a position to help you.
Follow.
Breach, with me.
The rest of you, remain here.
Master, my place is at your side.
I want no interruptions, Biowulf.
Is that clear?
Okay, folks, here's the 411.
V.K., Noface... getting cozy.
Gonna try to bust it up.
That's all I got for now.
Over and out.
Oh, don't you dare hang up.
I'm feeling a cramp coming on.
You're right, you know.
We should be down there with him.
What is he up to, anyway?
I... do not know.
You don't know?
I thought he trusted you with everything.
Of course he does!
He just...
Hey!
Easy on the stealth suit...
Which apparently isn't so stealthy.
Rex?
Providence spy!
Right!
Man, got it in one!
Yep, we heard V.K. was looking for a new second-in-command.
What?
!
True story.
Got it straight from intel.
Not surprised, really.
That Noface is one bad dude.
Guess Bio-whelp here ain't cutting it these days.
Seen it before.
First they keep you out of meetings.
Then the boss chews you out for trying to do your job.
Next thing you know, you're king orders from the new guy, and you're just another hench like Skalamander.
Now comes the moment where our hero sweeps the girl off her feet.
Don't let him!
Literally!
- Hey!
Let...
- See you around, henchie!
Follow them!
Down!
Now!
Not till we hear each other out.
Sure.
I'll go first.
Aah!
Oh, great!
Way to go, Circe!
Any word from Rex?
He ain't back, and I'm still holding the bag.
Hold on.
Rex?
That you, pal?
Hidin' in plain sight.
I hate this place.
Invaders have come before.
They brought only pain.
It is a pain we both share.
The same Providence outsiders attacked my lands, destroyed my army.
There was one who tormented us...
Humiliated us.
The grower of machines.
Ah, Rex.
Another thorn we share.
My proposal is simple.
You control a formidable legion.
I, in turn, can provide the escape and the vengeance you seek.
I can be your liberator.
You can be my general.
Together, we will crush our enemies, starting with the one you hate most.
Now, then, are we...
Master, I have a report.
This is a private conversation.
Can't you handle the slightest detail without bothering me?
Of course, master.
It was nothing.
Whoa!
Aah!
Ouch.
Our hero pursues the girl of his dreams, heedless of her attempts to break his heart.
Along with the rest of him.
Circe!
Just give me one minute, okay?
Look, no powers.
One minute.
But if this is about leaving the pack...
Please.
I'm way past that.
There are bigger things going on here than who you hang out with.
50 seconds.
I wasn't sent here to spy on you.
I'm here to stop these things from ever getting out.
40.
Why are you telling me this?
You know who I am.
You've seen the things that live here.
Whatever deal you think Van Kleiss is making, it's going to turn out bad for everyone.
30 seconds.
I do know who you are, Circe.
Just once think for yourself!
Maybe your perfect leader could actually be wrong, maybe even a bit crazy.
Nuts!
Certifiably insane!
Shut up!
20.
Talk about blinded.
Did you ever wonder why van kleiss is so interested in you?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe he wants me dead.
Not anymore.
Something has changed, Rex.
Ever since you got your powers back, I hear him talking.
Says you have something that's the key to everything.
For whatever reason, he needs you alive.
I know it, Rex.
He'd never let you be killed.
- Never, huh?
- Time's up.
Enough talk.
Free us.
You understand I need certain... assurances.
Assurances?
Explain.
If I free you, will you trust in my leadership and mine alone?
Leadership must be proven.
Show us you can defeat our enemies.
Now, this looks like a party.
Rex.
You never cease to amaze me.
Defiler!
Give it to us!
Now do you believe I can deliver what I say?
Will you agree to my leadership?
We agree to it!
Give it to us!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Van Kleiss, I didn't bring Rex here so you could...
He'll kill him!
Never forget how I found you, Circe, what you were before.
He's yours.
You!
Bring him to the vestibule!
You have your orders.
I'm going to enjoy this.
You were supposed to finish me off.
Now you just get to watch with the other hench bags.
Surrounded by the jeering throng, the hero faces certain doom.
The heartbreaker looks on.
When it's over, she'll regret shunning his advances.
Now you feel...
My pain!
First, a few ground rules.
Nothing below the belt, and I have a date on Friday, so easy on the face.
It's not exactly a problem in your case, having no face and all.
Huh?
Aah!
No anchovies on pizza.
No stripes with plaids.
Aah!
Termine ser sentados, por favor!
Is this what you wanted?
Stop this!
Please!
You need him alive!
Alive... yes.
Heart pumping, lungs breathing.
But his mind?
The less that's left of that, the better.
Circe, I warn you.
Lift so much as a finger to help him, and you're finished.
I'll have this trash removed.
And now that you've had your fun, it's time to finalize our...
We will have our full revenge!
It seems we've reached something of an impasse.
We take orders from no one!
I'm not driving a wedge between you, am I?
Well played.
Good news for me.
For you, not so much.
Pity we couldn't have worked something out.
Breach, if you would?
Looks like the hard way, then.
Huh?
His work here finished, the hero does the noble thing.
He runs like a thief.
Adiós!
Where the heck have you been?
!
You're not still holding on to that, are you?
Because it's a good thing...
you know, with the whole kaboom.
- Doc, I'm back.
- There you are.
Rex, listen to me.
If the shield fails, the only solution is a cold reboot of the system.
I don't need to tell you what will happen if the things in there get out.
Keep your lab coat on.
This will only take a minute.
Or maybe not.
Doc, you remember back at the briefing, all that stuff you were saying about worst-case scenarios?
Yeah, we have a winner.
I got nothing.
Great.
'Cause this situation's not random enough already.
Let's throw some raging teen hormones into the mix.
You, Biowulf, even me...
We're all just means to an end for him.
He doesn't really care about any of us.
Oh, you finally figured that out.
Well, better late than never, I guess.
It's not too late, not if I have anything to say about it.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
There are some of us around here that might not like the sound of whatever you're about to do.
I'll adjust the frequency to exclude friendly evos.
- Does that include me?
- For now.
Whoa, mama!
I thought you said you could filter it.
It's not an exact science.
It worked.
You're calling them all back.
And right towards us.
Torn between saving his friends or the world, our hero makes the stupid choice.
Come on, Bobo...
Focus.
Think bananas.
Think how much you hate 'em!
Get that thing running.
Rex, you'll need to follow this sequence exactly.
No time for that!
Shield activation in 60 seconds.
59... 58...
Gotcha.
Not seeing much of a difference.
We are out of here!
- You coming or what?
- I was never here.
14... 13... 12... 11... 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1.
Van Kleiss?
Eh, Breach'll get him out...
Eventually.
But right now he's in there, you're out here.
You'll never have a better time to consider, you know, your options.
What is it about stealing from our own people that's so dang satisfying'?
You forgot to remove the tracker.
Eh.
Funny that.
I'm not going to Providence.
Doesn't matter where you go.
All that matters is that you want to go there.
That said...
I hear Hong Kong's nice this time of year.
And so the tired warrior journeys homeward... crisis averted, world saved, villains vanquished.
Girl not got.
Again!
Do you have to rub it in?
This programme contains some violent scenes.
This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find upsetting.
The Bag Man's there.
He's always there.
You say a word, you think a word, he'll come for you.
He'll come for you.
(He'll come for your eyes.)
Can you see him?
He's out there.
CHILD HUMS "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"
(He'll come for your eyes.)
The skin looks like it's been lacerated.
The intensity of the fire.
Temperatures reached are often high enough to create these kind of fissures.
So that's what killed her?
The fire?
Well, the carboxyhaemoglobin level in her postmortem blood sample was high.
So the smoke killed her?
In...any blood from these lacerations, I'd expect to find similarly high levels of carbon monoxide but here, deep within the eye cavities, there was haemotoma clotting with very low levels of carbon monoxide.
Entirely normal, in fact.
Meaning what?
I think, before they torched the car, they put out her eyes.
Sweet girl.
Wasn't she?
Claire Somers as she is now, and as she was in 1986 when she was seven years old, the year she was abducted from her care home.
I don't remember her.
Me neither.
Probably wasn't much of a story.
An abducted kid...with bunches?
!
It was pre-the Children's Act 1989, so when a kid went missing from a care home, they just sent a fax to the police, who didn't move a muscle for 24 hours.
Without the media watching their every move...
They didn't move fast.
So to say the system failed Claire is a crime of understatement.
This is her mother, Trish Somers.
Drugs, prostitution.
Claire was taken away from her aged four.
Three years later, April 27th 1986, she was abducted from the care home, never to be seen again, until she turned up in a car park in Acton, incinerated with her eyes stabbed through.
SCREAMING
How do we know it's her?
DNA.
From 1986?
That was prescient!
The original investigation kept her hairbrush and pyjamas for the sniffer dogs.
Yeah.
Robert Fenchurch.
The cold case.
The manager and major shareholder of Endsleigh Lodge, Lewisham, the care home that Claire was taken from.
Now, Claire's abductor ran him over and found the time to go back and pop his eyes out as well.
MAN SCREAMS A few local sex offenders were rounded up and cleared, no prints at the scene and only one witness who couldn't ID the abductor.
Yeah, w-w-we'll get to that.
But didn't you hear what I just said?
That Claire and Fenchurch's killer have the same MO.
The eye thing?
The eye thing, right.
So we're looking for the same person.
So we start, not in 1986, we start last night.
The licence plate is indecipherable, but we're checking the chassis.
The sat-nav chip's OK.
These were on the dashboard.
They got some sort of protection because the rubber melted down over them.
It's a ballpoint pen.
SCREAMING Is this the weapon?
EVE:
Blood and tissue samples would suggest so.
You don't do this without compelling psychological motive.
You do this because the eyes signify something to you - something personal, something specific, perhaps something historic.
A pen's a bit spur of the moment, then, isn't it?
Well, if putting the eyes out is as strategic as you say it is, you'd expect a screwdriver or stiletto blade.
So it's opportunistic, it's improvised, it's in the moment.
But it doesn't diminish the significance of the eyes as a focus for rage.
We're probably looking at a dormant psychosis here.
EVE:
This I'm less sure about.
What is it?
A credit card?
No magnetic strip, but it is encoded with some kind of electrical signature.
A loyalty card?
Oyster card?
So what was this car park near to?
A sports centre and then the A40.
And what was on the other side of the A40, then?
A couple of hotels, right?
So, could this be, em...
one of those plastic room keys?
You book in online, check in with a credit card, a machine gives you your key, another machine vends tea, coffee, booze, condoms.
Any human beings involved at all?
Privately contracted cleaners.
Area manager.
I ran all the reservations for the dates you specified.
There were a number allocated, but only one booked for longer than 24 hours.
How long?
Four days.
Which room?
516.
Down there.
TV PLAYS
MUFFLED SCREAMS
It's all right, it's all right.
We're police officers.
It's all right.
OK.
WATER GUSHES
You're all right.
You're OK.
OK.
'The hospital have checked her out and there's no sign of sexual assault.
'What about forensics?
Eve matched DNA with the corpse.'
Claire Somers was in that hotel room.
And the room was booked by credit card in the name of Estelle Sharman.
No record.
The address the card is registered to, there's nobody there with that name.
How is she?
Dehydrated, exhausted, but thankfully, nothing else.
Good.
We can talk to her with a clear conscience.
Pardon?
Well, you can talk to her with whatever you like.
Mrs Harding?
Detective Superintendent Boyd.
Abigail...
Thank you.
Thank you for finding my daughter.
Do you have to do this now?
I'm afraid we do, yeah.
My elder daughter, Teresa.
Um...
Aha.
I'm a doctor.
I've given her something to calm her nerves.
Right.
Must be nice having someone in the family to take care of you.
Mrs Harding...
Doctor..
please.
We don't stay here?
No, 'fraid not.
'This car stopped and someone got out.
'Had you met her before?
'I met her in a department store.'
Right.
Sometimes I pinch stuff just to see if I can get away with it.
Ah, and she caught you?
I thought she was security.
Just some nail varnish, but... then she bought it for me - insisted.
I met her a few times after that.
She'd talk to me, listened.
She was...nice.
Well, at least I thought she was nice.
Get her name, Grace, will you?
'Did she tell you her name?
'Estelle.'
I liked her.
I wouldn't have got in the car otherwise.
I'm not stupid.
I liked her and she locked me in that cupboard.
Who else was in the room, Grace?
Was there anyone else in the room or was it just her?
I-I-I know this is difficult.
Just take your time.
HE SIGHS Grace, did she see anyone else?
(For God's sake...) Come on, Grace, please.
It's very important that we get this information, Abigail.
Was there anyone else in the room?
No.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
No.
No, no, no.
Not at all?
The Bag Man.
The Bag Man.
Sorry, I don't understand.
The Bag Man!
HEAVY BREATHING
The Bag Man!
The Bag Man.
SHE SOBS
The Bag...
It's OK.
'Shh.
OK?
'You don't have to do any more.
It's all right.'
The name the woman used was Estelle Sharman.
Does that mean anything to you?
We think her real name, the name that she was born with, was Claire Somers.
No.
I'm sorry.
Seven hours seems a long time to wait before reporting your daughter missing, isn't it?
A-A-Abigail can be reckless.
So it's pretty regular for her to come home late from school?
Yes.
Is there anyone that she's been hanging out with who you think could be involved in all this?
No, not at all.
Abigail's brothers are here.
How is she?
She's having a rest, but you can take her home.
But I will need to talk to her again.
Why?
She's safe now.
You've found her.
Because a woman was killed and Abigail was somehow involved with that.
While you're all here, can I ask you...?
Abigail was...
Well, she mentioned the Bag Man.
Do you know what that means?
The Bag Man?
It's just a story.
That we used to tell each other as kids.
Yeah, he's not a real person.
HEAVY BREATHING
What do we know about the Hardings?
London born and bred.
Leo Harding has been claiming incapacity benefit since 1995.
Why?
He suffered a stroke.
Karen's a music teacher.
And the boys?
Painter-decorators - have their own company, still live with Mum and Dad and Teresa lives a few streets away.
She's young, though, Abigail?
There's got to be 15 years between her and Teresa.
Well, that's not unusual.
It happens.
I know.
So, Claire was taken. 25 years later, she takes another girl.
That's hardly going to be random, is it?
Maybe she was doing it for someone else.
Like who?
The people who abducted her in the first place.
Remember how long she'd have been living with them.
She would have become entirely dependent on them.
But why was Claire abducted 25 years ago?
Was she a random victim herself?
Was she chosen?
Was she hand-picked in advance?
That is the big question.
There was a witness to her abduction at Endsleigh Lodge.
Who?
12-year-old Peter Broading.
And do we know what's happened to him?
He's still there.
What?
He runs the place.
DOORBELL RINGS
How long have you been in charge here, Mr Broading?
Over ten years now, but, em...
I was here before.
But then, of course, you know that.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
I left when I was 16.
Not an ideal childhood, but, eh... you make your accommodations with your past.
Who can say?
But if I hadn't lived through those years, then I may well not have come back here again.
And the changes we've made, the life we offer now...
Good comes from bad, sometimes, I think.
Well, we're here to talk about the bad, about Robert Fenchurch and what happened to him the night that this girl...went missing.
Claire.
I remember her.
'I heard the TV on.
It was late at night.
'She was doing keep-fit.' What are you doing?
'She always wanted to be a dancer.' What I really need is a skipping rope.
'She said she wanted a skipping rope.' Wait there.
'So I went off to find something.
'And when I came back...
he'd taken her.'
I did nothing to stop him...
and nothing to help her.
You were 12-years-old.
She would've saved me.
She would've tried.
And how do you think this man got in?
Well, this was a very different place back then.
There were no security codes or panic buttons.
So people just came and went as they pleased?
Mr Fenchurch did his best with meagre resources and a skeleton staff.
And he gave his life trying to stop Claire's abductor.
And that should be his epitaph?
Sacrificed in the line of?
Absolutely.
Stop, stop!
Did you see what happened to Fenchurch?
No.
Or the face of the man who took Claire?
It was dark.
He was hooded.
And you made no attempt to raise the alarm or...?
I didn't.
No.
So coming back here is your redemption?
My life's work.
Whoever Claire Somers was, she had expensive and illegal tastes.
I extracted these from the flesh area around her neck, and they're a match for fibres from the hotel room.
A shahtoosh.
A what?
It's a shawl derived from...
Tibetan antelopes.
..Tibetan antelopes.
E-E-Exactly.
It's an endangered species.
The hair is so fine that the average shawl can pass through a wedding ring.
And they go for about ten to 15,000 on the black market.
Over here we have Claire's bag.
Canvas body, leather straps and corners, sterling silver clasp.
I believe it's one of these.
So it's expensive?
Over a grand, I'd say.
The car - registered to a Penny Milton.
Runs a parties-and-events company.
Yet to report it missing.
Sat nav?
It's programmed routes took her to Finchley...
That's where Abigail lives.
Well, she was stalking her.
Other journeys?
Yeah.
Postcodes in and around Chelsea, Belgravia, Knightsbridge...
Heathrow being the longest journey.
PAPER RUSTLES A tenner... says Penny Milton has a record for vice.
Ran a knocking shop off the Mile End Road.
SHE LAUGHS
Thanks, Spence.
So this is us.
The Jordanian Embassy.
Belgium, Spain.
Over here there's Saudi, Russia.
You get the idea - lots of money, prestige, transients.
Penny organises personal or larger-scale group encounters.
It's all very exclusive, expensive stuff.
Claire's bag and her shawl, they feel like accessories that were given to her.
It's a particular kind of luxury.
For a particular kind of party.
Yeah.
Now, this is what I'm interested in.
I got an old colleague to pull up a file.
That's Penny's right-hand woman.
A very expensive asset, apparently.
According to Vice, she did a lot of recruitment as well, if you know what I mean.
Guess what name she goes by?
Estelle Sharman.
OK.
Endsleigh Lodge?
Members of staff.
Hardly comprehensive.
But none have records.
But the kids...different story.
Cautions for prostitution.
13-years-old, Grace.
Fenchurch must have turned a blind eye to this at the very least.
After some digging, I found these reports from '85, issued by a Lewisham Council social worker.
The implication is that this "stuff"
was all part of the service at Endsleigh Lodge.
"Lack of corroborative evidence.
No further action."
Fenchurch only got a slapped wrist.
None of this was even mentioned in the original investigation.
I'm thinking... maybe this was suppressed.
Maybe the girls were too frightened to point the finger.
Local authorities had no powers to investigate.
This is long before police protection orders.
Different times, Spence.
That's what Broading said.
I was told to ask for Estelle.
Estelle isn't here but I'm sure I can help you with whatever...
This is where you organise the parties, right?
We're a fully-licensed business, if that's what you mean.
Estelle does work here?
Yes.
And this is where she entertains her guests?
We're a little busy right now.
I thought you were in the party business.
I love a party, I do.
You wouldn't think to look at me but, after a few, I do really get down.
Hello, ladies.
Let's be clear.
Estelle is my associate, my business associate.
Yeah, and she's a little too old, isn't she, to be doing this kind of entertaining?
If you like.
Too old and too dead.
Estelle Sharman, real name, Claire Somers.
Stabbed in the eyes and burnt to a crisp hours after she abducted this girl.
My God.
This is where she used to stay sometimes.
What did she do for you, this Estelle?
Pick girls off the street?
Oh.
That's what you're leading up to.
I send Estelle out to kidnap the under-aged?
Look, what I do here is professional, protected and consensual.
And I've never brought anyone into this that didn't ask first.
Right, how did you meet Estelle?
She was on the street, 16 years of age, pretty girl, she saw what she could earn, picking and choosing from a stream of wealthy men.
And she never told you her real name?
She didn't want to.
I named her Estelle.
Where was home for her?
I didn't ask.
You didn't ask?
You don't.
Anyway it's always the same story, home isn't there any more.
When was the last time you saw her?
About a week ago.
She'd stopped talking to me.
And was that unusual behaviour for her?
It happens.
I told her to sort it, go and see someone, get some happy pills.
Whatever it took to put the smile back on her face.
You sent her to a doctor?
Which doctor?
I wasn't here to hold her hand.
I've been through the staff and resident names you provided.
A lot of your contemporaries picked up records - drugs, prostitution, petty theft.
That's far from unusual with kids from a care home background.
I'm talking about while they were still here, aged 13 or 14.
And what's weird is that a lot of those arrests were made a good way from here
- Margate, Chatham, Hastings - when they were supposed to be resident here.
There were trips.
Seaside, museums, that kind of thing.
Kids like that, you give them an inch...
Did you go?
I never liked the sound of it.
Too far from home.
So who drove the bus?
Fenchurch?
Mr Broading.
All I remember is a man and a van.
I don't know why you think I'd be able to tell you something I couldn't tell the others.
Someone took her.
They never brought her back.
Now she's dead.
Nothing to do with me.
And you never wondered where she was or who'd taken her?
Well, course I've thought about it.
But wherever she was, she was better off without me.
I'm sorry, Mrs Somers, but even though we're still trying to determine the exact circumstances around your daughter's death, what is clear to us is that she was involved in prostitution from a young age.
She may have been abducted for that exact purpose.
What?
At seven?
Endsleigh Lodge isn't so far from where you've lived all your life.
Isn't that right?
But we know what kind of place it was - the brutality, the neglect.
You must have too, no?
The circles you moved in then, the men you would have known about.
Did you really never have any suspicions?
DOG BARKS
You still here?
SHE SOBS
Penny said that she sent Estelle for what she called "happy pills", yeah?
Yes.
Well, anti-depressants, Prozac, that sort of stuff, you can't just dish that out.
You have to have a semblance of patient history, and medical background.
So she must have a pet doctor.
And there are four private practices in the immediate area around her flat.
Hello.
Save it.
Dr Harding.
This is extraordinary.
This woman...
She took Abigail?
We believe so, yeah.
Did you prescribe her any medication?
I did.
I also told her to think about a course in cognitive behavioural therapy and...
Oh, my God.
She asked about her.
How old she was.
She's not someone that you or your colleagues have ever seen or treated before?
No.
Absolutely not.
Does the clinic have CCTV?
Yes, I believe so.
Well, we'd like to get a more recent image of her if we can.
Of course.
Here we have Claire in the clinic.
Waiting for her appointment for anti-depressants.
She's got that bag.
Yeah.
Here's Teresa.
Watch her reaction.
Now Claire's reaction.
She seems frozen to the spot.
See the unnatural distance between the two of them.
Now watch as Claire steps forward,
Teresa's arms go up to protect herself.
The unconscious mind controlling posture as a way of managing feeling.
Grace, we cross our arms all the time.
Sarah crosses her arms whenever she sees me.
See how wary Teresa is of Claire.
Whoever Claire is, those two women know each other.
You've never been anywhere like this before, have you?
I expect you're wondering why you're still here.
To do with Abi.
That woman.
It's more about that woman than Abigail.
Come on, Teresa, how long have you two known each other?
I don't know what you mean.
I told you I'd never seen her before she came in that day.
That's a lie.
That is a lie.
That certainly was not the first time that you two had ever met.
You see, that's why we bring people in here.
To stop them telling lies to us.
But I'm not lying.
I promise.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
Was she Estelle to you or Claire?
What did she want from you?
Was she threatening you?
Is that why she took Abigail or were you both involved in taking Abigail?
You will tell me the truth.
I want you to be sure of that, Teresa.
I want you to be sure of the fact that you are going to tell me...
..the truth.
TERESA HUMS
Boyd?
What?
Can I have a word, please?
TERESA CONTINUES TO HUM
You need to go easy on her.
She's frightened of you.
Well, why wouldn't she be?
She's never been in this position before.
She's disassociating.
She's removing herself from harm.
OK, you've registered your complaint, so if she freaks out, I accept full responsibility.
Can't you hear her?
Yes, I can.
She is humming a child's nursery rhyme!
It's some childhood block-out thing she used to do.
You're witnessing a full-blown psychological haemorrhage!
1999, she had to re-sit an entire year after a nervous breakdown.
Here's the other thing - four credit cards all maxed out.
Her credit rating screwed.
So Teresa has a history of mental illness and bad debts.
So, what if she was involved in the kidnap of her own sister?
Teresa and Claire kidnap Abigail?
Yeah, and then they fell out.
What about...?
Yeah, the eye thing, I know but she had a breakdown, didn't she?
Hm?
Yes, but mental frailty doesn't equal psychosis, Boyd.
What?
You can't talk to her.
I'm not going to.
Mr Harding?
Hello.
Hello.
My wife's inside.
Would you like me to go and find her?
Yes, please.
If you'll excuse me.
Yeah.
No.
No, it's just not possible.
Could Claire Somers have known something about her?
Like what?
Well, she had a breakdown at med school, didn't she?
That was a long time ago.
She's a good girl.
There is CCTV footage of their meeting at the clinic.
I questioned Teresa and the questions seemed to disturb her so badly that I had to terminate the interview.
Mum!
What's going on?
He wants to talk about Teresa.
He thinks she's involved.
What?
That's ridiculous.
Oh.
Is she OK?
I had her taken home but she'll be back again with me tomorrow unless of course you can help me here.
What did you do to her?
What brought on her breakdown when she was at medical school?
Hm?
Anyone?
Mum?
Come on.
They're going to find out sooner or later.
I suppose, like a lot of students, she experimented.
She went to parties, she did drugs.
They didn't really agree with her.
The first we knew about it she'd come back home and barricaded herself in her bedroom.
She refused to come out and she wouldn't even talk to us about what was going on.
But, we cared for her, and she got well again.
Was there anyone else involved?
In what sense?
Well, was she involved with a dealer, or...?
No, no, it was just with a bad crowd but not for very long.
Because you straightened her out?
If you like.
She never received any kind of treatment?
Well, she was hardly an addict.
You made no attempt to discover the underlying problem?
Why would she need a shrink when she's got her family?
So you brushed it under the carpet, basically?
Bad news, Max.
It didn't work.
Bottle of lager.
Got a glass?
You bastard!
You bastard!
GLASS SHATTERS
Trish?
Trish, can you hear me?
Can you tell me what happened?
It's OK.
What's his name?
Terry Reid.
Man with a van.
Broading told me about a guy who took the care home kids to the seaside when the girls were picked up for soliciting.
He ran a company called AwayDaze.
Local authority's blacklisted him.
When did they shut him down?
Not been registered since '98.
And there he is.
He smashed her to bits.
Did you know this man?
I used to.
Did you know him when he looked like this?
Hm?
What about her?
That's Trish Somers' daughter, Claire.
If you're asking me about them, you'll know that I was cleared from all that the first time round.
We do know that, it's true, but there has to be a reason why the original investigation didn't look at you harder then.
We know you used to take the Endsleigh kids out on your bus.
Lewisham Council employed you, that's before they ran inconvenient procedures like
CRB checks.
So, what happened?
New markets down on the Kent coast, was it?
Claire Somers was abducted in April '86, there's no alibi worth the name, no interviews on file and now this.
That's Claire as you'd find her now.
What?
Is that why that crazy bitch went for me?
She thought I had something to do with that?
Yes.
I think she does.
She can't explain to us why because she's too busy getting her jaw rewired!
So, this is what I think.
I think that Trish holds you entirely responsible for what happened to her daughter, and when her daughter turned up, burnt to a crisp, understandably it tipped her over the edge, gave her the courage to confront a man who, for
the past 25 years, has terrified her so much that she daren't say anything to anybody.
No.
No way.
You're insane.
Well, if I am, you should be worried, because what happens to the rest of your life is in my hands.
So, Robert Fenchurch, 1986.
Did he catch you trying to take Claire away?
Tried to stop you so you took him out?
Is that what you think happened here, sweetheart?
Brave Robert Fenchurch protecting his kids?
Gets run over, had his eyes stabbed out for his troubles?
You must be desperate.
Well, that's what you do, isn't it?
Huh?
You don't have a brain so you use your muscle?
You want to know why I was cleared the first time round?
Your lot wanted that case filed and gathering dust as soon as possible.
Why?
Cos they made a fortune from it.
We all did.
Fenchurch let me use his boys to run pills and smack whenever and wherever he wanted as long as he was getting his 10%.
The girls?
When they were old enough, yeah, same thing.
And the local nick got a cut of everything Fenchurch made.
It was a racket.
So Robert Fenchurch was in charge.
It was his operation.
I wouldn't say that exactly.
Well, who was in charge, then?
The kids.
Oh, come on!
It wasn't exploitation, love.
It was a partnership.
That's the most repulsive, self-serving bullshit I've ever heard.
There's something you need to understand about Endsleigh Lodge.
The kids, OK?
Once they were outside you could get them to do stuff you wanted.
But inside...
Inside, they were top dog.
They ruled that place.
When they were all in there together, it weren't natural.
It was a kind of hell.
SHE SCREAMS
You say a young child was taken away from there?
Lucky them.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm definitely charging him with GBH.
Reid could be right about the kids running the place.
Half of them were hooked on heroin, violence was commonplace.
It was complete anarchy there.
It's not the picture that Peter Broading painted.
Maybe he's got something to hide.
All the other kids' files are present and correct. his is missing.
So he removed it, destroyed it?
If that's the case, be good to know why.
Certainly would.
Maybe he didn't destroy it.
Maybe he just didn't want anyone else to see it.
Why would he want to hang onto it?
It's a formal acknowledgement of his childhood, his existence.
Kids who grow up without parents seek validation wherever they can.
I'm sold.
He lives on the premises.
Forget it.
I know the entry key number. 1986.
1986.
The year Claire was taken.
10-4.
And, Chloe, you take over.
Go on.
These wounds are old, but they're horrific - on both his arms - completely symmetrical!
You didn't get his file.
It's not in his flat unless it's under the bloody floorboards.
Grace!
Yes?
He would've been assessed, right?
This man, Broading?
Yes, he would.
Well, can you get me that report, please?
It'll be classified.
Please, Grace.
Just use your charm or bribery or something?
I'll see what I can do.
Can you do it quickly?
PHONE RINGS
RINGING STOPS
PHONE RINGS
Please.
I never said anything.
You have to believe me!
Please!
It's me.
I...
I'm so sorry.
I just need to tell you this because...
I need to tell that you have to leave...because... ..he's real.
The Bag Man is real.
I love you.
SHE SCREAMS
SHE SCREAMS
Is this what we think it is?
Yes, and no.
The front door was locked, there was no sign of forced entry but...
Why would she do this?
She's a doctor and the bathroom's like a pharmacy.
She could've found a gentler way out.
But you're assuming it's suicide, she might have been pushed.
Well, come on.
What?
Come on.
Let's see.
Push?
Yeah.
I'd have clung on there, and there'd be fingerprints, but there aren't.
OK, she'd have been clinging on for dear life.
Yes, and broken fingernails but she didn't have any of those.
Instead, what we have is this full handprint here.
So she wasn't clinging on for dear life, she was actually trying to propel herself...
Yep.
..off the balcony.
Maybe she was just retreating from something in the room.
Why didn't she just turn round and then jump head first straight out?
Maybe she was just transfixed by something coming towards her.
Stop!
Mrs Harding?
Mrs Harding?
I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry, but I have to ask you all to leave.
We'll come and get you when we've finished here.
You...
You did this.
She was fine until you took her in.
You've taken her away from us.
Fine.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
That was the psychiatrist who assessed the kids at Endsleigh.
I told him about Claire turning up and what happened to her eyes.
He'll help us.
Does that mean he's going to give us Broading's file?
Yeah.
But we didn't get it from him.
The psychiatrist at Endsleigh believed that these cigarette burns were not self-inflicted, while these, masking symmetrical wounds inflicted later, were.
So, do you think that he was so ashamed of the burns he inflicted far worse on himself in an attempt to cover them up?
He thought the holes were eyes and, that by rubbing them out, he'd blind them.
So who inflicted the cigarette burns in the first place?
He wouldn't say.
The symmetry is controlled, strategic.
It's like he cut himself to heal himself.
Self-harm as self-validation.
Broading left the Lodge at 8:20.
Now, Eve puts the time of death no earlier than 9:00, so he could've made the journey to her flat.
So, victim-turned-abuser.
It wouldn't be the first time, would it?
Actually, it's a very small minority of abused children that go on to harm others.
There's an even smaller minority who decide to live and work in the care home where they grew up.
Did it work?
Did what work?
Did it stop them watching you?
Who put the eyes in there?
Because that's what you believed them to be.
Look, all I've tried to do is to help you, OK?
To go back to a very painful time.
You haven't.
You've lied about Fenchurch, what happened at Endsleigh Lodge, drugs, prostitution.
Why are you trying to protect Fenchurch?
Why protect him?
I mean, lying is very rarely altruistic though, is it?
Are you trying to protect yourself?
Did you work alongside him?
Did you organise the trips?
Did you put the kids in the bus, take them to the seaside with a bucket and spade?
What happened?
!
What was I supposed to do?
It was my home.
I didn't know anything else.
Everything I've done with my life, going back to that place, it's all been to make amends.
Didn't you feel guilty?
Didn't you feel loyalty to the other children?
It was every kid for himself.
Including Claire Somers?
No, no, not Claire.
And I wouldn't have let Fenchurch touch her either.
Well history doesn't bear that out.
Did Fenchurch do this to you?
And you cut yourself to stop him watching you but it didn't work so you had to do it for real?
You did the same thing to Claire.
What was in her eyes?
What did she see?
What did she know about you?
!
Eye mutilation's very rare, very specific.
I wouldn't be much of a detective if I didn't make the connection, though the crimes are 25 years apart.
It is the gap that is the unfathomable piece.
It wasn't Fenchurch.
Sorry?
It wasn't Fenchurch who put the eyes in my arms.
Fenchurch tried to save me.
It was David.
It was a...nine-year-old boy called David Drew.
Can you see them, Pete?
Cos they can see you.
They can see you helping Fenchurch when you think no-one's looking.
HE SCREAMS
Now tell me everything.
Everything!
A nine-year-old boy did that to you as punishment for working alongside Fenchurch?
That boy.
The rage in him.
Even they were scared.
Terrified.
David Drew.
Social Services had written him off from the moment he entered Endsleigh Lodge.
How old?
Five.
He was found in a squat, chained to the wall.
Some food and water had been left for him, but nothing to suggest he'd received any care or attention in the whole of his short life.
Sexually abused?
We don't know.
He was never examined.
So the boy himself didn't say anything?
No.
He didn't even know who he was.
The care home gave him his name?
That's about all they did give him.
Fenchurch's two-line report says he was unreachable.
They gave up on him.
No attempt to understand what would have been an intensely hostile attitude towards the world around him.
It was just a matter of how to cage him.
He knew Fenchurch had every reason to hurt him.
He knew Claire.
Yeah, but we still have a problem.
Yeah, a nine-year-old boy couldn't have abducted Claire, then run Fenchurch over.
For one.
And two,
David Drew wasn't there in April '86.
Fenchurch had him sent down.
To where?
Borstal.
He was on his way to a temporary unit but then he went missing.
They never found him?
Never.
When did he run away?
February '86.
Two months before Fenchurch was killed and Claire was abducted.
Is that a connection?
There's no police record.
He doesn't crop up ever again.
A nine-year-old boy just vanishes.
'The Bag Man's there.
He's always there.'
SHE SCREAMS
'Can you see him?
'He's out there.
'You say a word, you think a word, he'll come for you.
(He'll come for your eyes.)'
Right, and the letter?
It's just fragments really, there's nothing coherent.
Is that Dr Foley?
I need to speak to you.
It was just a story.
The Bag Man's there.
Looks like he applied for a replacement birth certificate... and built a whole new identity around it.
Do as I say or the Bag Man will get you.
Don't tell me I won't understand that it wasn't like that.
It wasn't like that!
Tell me what happened then!

***** today the Pentagon released eye tape seized in Sunday's raid in Pakistan, purported to be osama bin laden's last will and testament.
The tape runs about three minutes.
Translator:
Allah be praised.
I, osama bin laden, being in present and good health and of sound mind and memory, thanks be to Allah, hereby declare the following to be my last will and testament.
First, as to my funeral arrangements, it is my wish that they be conducted in strict accordance with islamic law.
As pallbearers, I designate my five oldest sons and Dakota fanning.
If Dakota fanning is positively unavailable, my executors may replace her with a Dakota fanning look-alike, although I do ask that they try to get the real Dakota fanning if that is at all possible.
If by the time of my death
Dakota fanning is over 12 years of age or is no longer a virgin, my executors are to replace her with her younger sister if she has one.
Although, again, a 12-year-old virgin Dakota fanning is my absolute first choice.
Second, as to my place of burial,
I leave the decision to my executors, provided that wherever it is, they do not bury me at sea.
As my family well knows, I have a deathly fear of being eaten by fish, so I'm very serious about this.
Do not bury me at sea.
Third, as executor to this, my last will and testament,
I name my dear friends at the Pakistani intelligence services.
They are solid, reliable people and, may I add, among the few individuals a person can still trust in this corrupt, cynical world we live in.
Fourth, as a special bequest to my devoted human shield, fatima,
I leave an autographed picture along with the bulletproof vest she always asks about.
Finally, before I discuss the disposition of my worldly estate consisting of cash, stocks, bonds, annuities and certificates of deposit,
has always been greatly exaggerated by the media.
Frankly, I have no idea where they get some of their numbers.
Second, bear in mind that my investment portfolio was badly hurt by the market downturn in 2008, plus the subsequent flash crash and is not fully recovered.
In addition, I have incurred a number of major expenses in the last few years, building my compound, paying bodyguards and couriers, training and equipping jihadists, medical expenses, laundry, office supplies, sandals and so on.
So that should be factored in as well.
Also, with 115 children, 750 grandchildren, and 11,000 nieces and nephews, each individual share may not be as large as he or she may have anticipated.
So all that having been said, I hereby leave to my heirs to be divided among them equally, my entire personal estate currently valued at 3,600,000 Pakistani ruppees or $781.61 U.S.
Obviously, this is not as much as you or I would have hoped for, but there you have it.
It is what it is.
Also, some of this, I imagine, will go to probate fees.
Now, I know that many of you must be disappointed at the size of the estate, and I suppose that now I'm suddenly some kind of bad person.
Do I wish the estate were larger?
Of course.
I wish a lot of things.
I wish we had outdoor air conditioning.
I wish mecca had better restaurants.
I wish camel poop tasted like spicy hummus, but guess what?
It doesn't.
So I leave you with this.
Instead of complaining about what we don't have, let's just be thankful for what we do.
Our health, each other... and best of all, the knowledge that try as they might, the Americans will never catch me.
Isn't that the most important thing?
I hereby declare the above to be my last will and testament, and live from new York, it's Saturday night. with Fred armisen

Ellie goulding and your host, tina fey!
Ladies and gentlemen, tina fey!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It is great to be here hosting the mother's day episode of "Saturday night live."
And I know there is kind of a famous impression I do on the show, and maybe people are wondering if I'm going to do it.
So here it is.
I sure do like them there French fried potatoes.
Okay, I did it.
We can all relax.
This is a really exciting time for me.
I have the number one book in the country.
And the number 86 tv show.
And I don't know if you guys noticed when I came out, but I have been drinking a lot of beer.
And I'm expecting my second child.
Because I am six months pregnant, this should make for some exciting live television.
Be sure to keep your at-home there is an incredibly good chance that I will accidentally break wind at someepoint during tonight's performance.
And it is mother's day, and I am the "snl" family right now.
So please welcome the fabulous Maya Rudolph.
Thanks for having me, tina.
That's what our babies are going to be saying.
You know, I think I speak for Maya when I say we really love being mothers.
And I think I speak for Tina when I say we can't wait to meet our precious new ones.
We have so much to tell them.
Maybe we should start right now.
Sweet little baby tiny little darling
I cannot wait to know you
I can feel you kick me so happy that you picked me
I cannot wait to hold you
I look into your eyes and see my little copy the reason that you're here is your parents got real sloppy that's right.
And you are the proof that we've been doing it doing it making super sexy heat your mom and dad have been doing it doing it baby you are the receipt baby you endorse that we've been having intercourse
oh baby oh baby baby baby baby
I have so many things I want to say to you, baby.
Baby, thank you for my ginormous temporary tatas.
I promise to work them in bikini tops until the moment you are born.
Baby, I'm sorry about that three weeks that I didn't know you were in there.
The little Sushi rose wine and roller coasters never hurt nobody.
Promise me baby that if you're a lady, don't move in with Charlie sheen or whoever is Charlie sheen at that future time.
Probably still Charlie sheen.
That son of a bitch is going to live forever.
Yep.
Baby, when you're coming out,
I may call you some names I didn't really mean like uterus hog, damn jerk.
And the only one I meant, pain in the vagina.
Baby, when you gre ow up, dot make the same mistakes I made, specifically getting drunk on rose wine and having unprotected sex on a roller coaster at epcot Japan.
P baby, no matter what I say always know that mama loves you as much as she loves doing it.
Now with the help of science and a sonogram machine,
***** we will do duets with our unborn feti Natalie Cole style.
You're my baby
I'm your baby you're my mother
I'm your mother
***** when we say that we've been doing it we mean love

Ellie goulding is here!
And now a special fox news presentation.
Live at Daniel Webster college in nashua, new Hampshire.
It's the 2012 undeclared candidates debate with your host, shepard Smith.
I'm Shepard Smith.
My voice is both reassuring and deeply unsettling.
Welcome this week's second gop debate.
On thhrsday five official republican candidates squared off in South Carolina.
The debate included Ron Paul, tim pawlenty, rick santorum and I'm going to stop there before I fall asleep.
Why don't we shift from the candidates you don't know much about to candidates you wish you knew less about.
Please welcome former Massachusetts governor mitt romney.
****
I've been smiling for the last four years, but I haven't been happy once.
Former speaker of the house, newt gingrich.
I love the '90s.
Minnesota congresswoman Michele bachmann.
It's a pleasure to be here.
Current famous person Sarah Palin.
Hi there.
You know, it's just so great to be back on fox news, a network that both pays me and shows me the questions ahead of time.
And I hope that tonight the lamestream media won't twist my words by repeating them verbatim.
And the Andrew "dice" Clay of the real estate world, donald trump.
The ratings for tonight's debate are going to be huge!
As big as last Sunday's "apprentice"
where star Jones got so mad she almost popped a staple.
Plus, at the end, we finally killed osama bin laden.
Osama, boom, you're fired.
Finally, he was uninvited but fought his way through security and refuses to leave, former New York gubernatorial candidate and current member of the podiums are too damn expensive party, jimmy mcmillen.
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
My name is Jimmy mcmillen, and I believe with the help of America's voters,
I could be this nation's last black president.
We begin with mitt romney.
You ran and lost in 2008.
What make you think you have a chance this time?
Peoole say a lot of things about me.
They say I'm rich, disconnected, a dead fish, they say I look like a villain in a lifetime movie.
Look out, meredith baxt Baxter-birney.
Why do they let me talk
**** in newt gingrich, you've never ran for president and I have a feeling you don't want to.
Would you like to duck out early?
Yeah, I'd love to.
Bye, newt.
Michele bachmann.
When msnbc wants to scare liberals into caring about elections, they have you on as a guest.
Hhw can you win over the independent voters?
Shepard, I'm hoping to establish a fatal attraction situation with America.
First I'll come off as intense and even a little bit sexy.
Over time the intensity will become overwhelming and you'll begin to fear what I will do if you make me angry.
A crazy woman untethered can be a dangerous thing.
Cars get keyed, on your doorstep.
You'll decide it's safer to marry me so you can keep an eye on me.
America, I challenge you to a staring contest.
And it begins now.
Well, mark me down as scared and horny.
Sarah Palin, many thought you needed to bone up on policy to be a serious candidate in 2012.
Instead you seem to have done the opposite, focusing on reality television and Twitter.
What, if anything, new do you have to offer the American people?
Well, first, I want to acknowledge that this week we finally vanquished one of the world's great villains,
Ann I, foo one, am thrilled to say good riddance to Katie Couric.
As for boning up on experience and policy,
I'm planning a trip to the middle east where I will be flipping a cameo in "hangover 3," the third "hangover."
The fellows go to a bar, and I'm there.
I also recently purchased rosetta stone English.
But the important thing for people to know is that I'm going to be running for president every four years for the rest of my life.
It's my Olympics, and I intend to win a whole bunch of silvers.
Donald trump.
Go.
You're welcome.
You know, there's a great American movie called "citizen Kane."
It's about a man who kicks ass and makes a ton of money.
I haven't seen the ending of this movie, but I assume it ends with him happy and president.
I want to be your citizen trump.
And if you criticize me, just remember, I'm rubber and you're gold.
So whatever you say doesn't you're losers.
Except you.
Sarah Palin, I like you.
If you want to be my vice president, all you have to do is sell more chili than nene atlant leakes over the course of a hot summer day in Times Square.
To conclude, this is a great time for this nation's greatest man, me.
"The celebrity apprentice" Sundays at 9:00 P.M. only on nbc.
Bing, bong, bbom.
You're fired.
I'm hired.
As president, you're fired. "The apprentice."
And finally, jimmy mcmillan.
Well, first, I want to address those in the birther movement who claim I was born a Billy goat.
Your suspicions are confirmed.
Part "c," I have recently received intelligence that osama bin laden is hiding in the ocean.
I will not rest until I find him.
So this mother's day, vote for me, the black lorax.
Now, let this debate begin!
That concludes tooighh's debate.
And in closing, I'd like to congratulate Barack Obama on his re-election.
I'm Shepard Smith.
And I'm a silly little catfish.
Good night.

oh, crabby, the human world is so amazing.
Wwen I went up there, I saw people dancing and seahorse-less carriages and I even found a watchamadoodle.
Princess, look around you.
You have everything you need right here at the bottom of the ocean.
I don't know, crabby.
Trust me, girl.
The human world is a mess.
But down here, it's paradise.
What do you mean, crabby?
Well, I'll tell you what I mean.
Below the waves below the waves we're always gabbing below the waves take it princess everyone's happy and relaxed we got a seahorse on the sax look at that manta he's drinking fanta below the waves
you know what, crabby?
You're right.
The bottom of the ocean is the perfect place to be.
That's the spirit, princess.
All of the dolphins play keyboard and the shrimp -
what is on me?
Can somebody tell me what's on me, please?
It's some sort of body wrapped in a - what's that word again?
Shroud oh, my God!
It's osama bin laden!
They threw bin laden's body in the ocean.
Get him off of me.
Wow, he's really dead.
This is a lot to process.
I don't even know how to react.
I know how to react.
Usa!
Usa!
Guys, I find that really distasteful.
But we got him!
You didn't do anything.
And you're drunk.
I'm drunk because I'm celebrating.
And you're using this as an excuse.
To get drunker.
Yeah, you got me.
Can we talk about this after you get him off me?
Please?
I mean, this guy caused 9/11.
Did he?
Shut up.
No one wants to hear your conspiracy theories, manta.
I have had it with these humans.
They throw down their garbage, their oil spills and their cruise ships use our home as a toilet.
So do we.
I'm going right now.
Besides, crabby, they probably couldn't bury him on land because his supporters would turn his grave into a shrine.
So?
Good.
Bury him, and then when anyone shows up, arrest them.
Or just bury him at gitmo.
I'm here to see osama bin laden's grave.
Oh, here he is right over here.
Welcome to jail.
Crabby, calm down.
You're turning all red.
I'm red because I'm a crab.
Now, get Obama off of me.
I mean osama.
I keep doing that.
Just one letter.
Pretty weird, right?
Shut up.
Look, crabby, the current is taking his body away.
We'll never have to see himm again.

weekend update
"weekend update" with
good evening, I'm Seth meyers, and here are tonight's top stories.
Dead
Not armed well, somewhere high above us, there's 72 super bummed-out virgins.
The white house on Tuesday revealed that osama bin laden was not armed when Navy s.E.A.L.S found him, but they say he did resist them.
Hey, white house, armed, unarmed, not resisting, holding a bunny, we're totally cool with you shooting bin laden.
So, I'm guessing this week everybody looked like a Navy s.E.A.L. To moammar gadhafi.
Muammar qaddafi dude, do not sneak up on me like that!
Al*** al qaeda on Friday released a statement confirming the death of osama bin laden.
They also announced that as a result, monday will be a half day.
Conspiracy*** in the wake of president Obama's decision to not release pictures of osama bin laden's body, a number of new conspiracy theories are surfacing claiming that bin laden is not really dead which means Barack Obama will go down in history
as the first black person ever o have to prove that he killed someone.
First one.
Approval*** in the wake of the killing of osama bin laden, president Obama's approval rating jumped to 56%, his highest in two years, which shows that there is literally nothing he can do to please the other 44%.
Week's big story, please welcome the devil.
Hi, the devil.
You don't seem like your usual, upbeat self.
Didn't you hear, we got bin laden?
Yeah.
Yeah, you got bin laden.
You know what that means, right?
Now I got bin laden.
So?
You know how it's my job to could ever imagine?
All right?
He was already living in a walled-in compound with 9 wives and 23 kids.
Usually when people come to hell, the first thing I do is give them four wives and seven kids.
But 9 and 23?
Ooh, my goodness, no!
Alllright?
And a place where he was, you know, staying in had no Internet, okay?
No Internet at all.
I mean, even in hell we have dial-up.
I may be the devil, but I'm not a monster.
- I don't want to tell you how to do your job.
- Then don't.
Why not just hit him with some fire and brimstone?
Yeah, you know what they call fire and brimstone in Pakistan, seth?
August.
This is a tough one, man.
Look, you're the devil.
I'm sure you'll think of something.
Thanks, bro.
It's so rare for people to be so encouraging to me.
I kind of consider you a friend.
- Oh, don't.
- No, I do.
I do.
It's already done.
Any-hell I just don't like, you know, the guy being there, okay?
He gives everyone the willies.
The other day I heard Jeffrey dahmer say "not in my backyard."
And I do not like the fact that bin laden calls America the sorry.
Copyright and trrdemark since, I don't know, the beginning of time.
Okay?
Yo soy el diablo, comprendo?
Major balls on that dude.
Major balls.
And guess this.
The very first day, walks right up to me and goes, okay.
Where's my 72 virgins?
Bro, this is hell.
It's not exactly crawling with virgins.
You take what you gets around here.
I'm sorry to hear it's not going well.
- There's not even a word for this.
- What do you mean?
This is awkward, but we can't find him.
- You lost him?
- No, no.
No...
We lost track of him temporarily.
I'm certain of it.
I'm sure he'll pop up.
And hey, if you're osama, you know, I will find you.
You think he's watching?
You have tv in hell?
Just nbc.
Whatever happened to "outsource"?
I loved that show.
It was a riot.
So what else is going on with you?
Me?
Well, it's New York City.
So I've got to go sit on some shoulders down in the financial district.

He just heard on the radio that the Vietnam war was over.
Instead of using narcotics, leilani releases her pain through focused breath into her partner's mouth.
Oh, my God, there's so much curry breath being exchanged right now.
*************
that is the dirtiest thing I've ever seen.
And I'm talking about bottoms of her feet.
When leilani feels ready for the ecstasy of pushing, victor removes her tunic.
Hey oh.
Laboosh.
Is that her, or does she have a standard poodle in her lap.
Freed from the constraints of a hospital bed, the couch allows leilani to experiment with what birthing position is most comfortable for her.
She can try any position she wants.That baby's not coming out without a weed whacker.
Having children in the room is a comfort to leilani and to remind her of the beautiful new life about to rip her perineum.
Why are they making their children watch this?
No, wait.
They said this was their first child.
Whose children are those?
Oh, my God, they're in Halloween costumes.
That is some murky business.
As the fields of poppies blooms almost all at once, leilani's birthing calls catch the ear of another woman in the area who is ripened with child.
There were less people than that at our last garage sale.
These two moon sisters in complete synchronicity with nature and their bodies assume a position where they can deliver each other's child.
Did the devil make this movie?
- Does this play on a flat-screen in the lobby of hell?
- Well, well, well, hang on.
This part isn't so bad.
****they call in response.
No, never mind.
Still terrible.
Ew, they're looking right at us!
With one final yet gentle push and a mutually quiet and shameless bowel movement,
leilani and endicott bring two healthy boyssinto the world.
Victor and jazurus are joyful beyond words.
Wait what, are those iPhones?
When was this made?
I recorded this last week.
This next section, they cook the placenta in a wok.
No!
No!
Hi, bedelia.You want to play truth or dare?
We're going to dare Danielle to put a picture of her boobs on Facebook.
No thanks.
My mom should be here any second.
- You're going home already?
- No, she's coming over to chill.
I figured the sleepover could use a strong female role model.
Um, okay.
Bedelia, honey.
Is everything okay?
Oh, hey, mom.
It's 1:00 in the morning.Why did you have me come back here?
Let's just say in a reverse Elvis,
I was looking for a little less action and a little more conversation.
So what's shaking, bacon?
Honey, I've got to go.
I feel weird here.
Mom, come on.
Let's hang out.
Bedelia, this is a sleepover.
It's a big bonding time for you kids.
- Isn't your best friend here?
- Yeah, dumb ass, I'm looking at her.
Hey, turn to the side.
And she's gone.
Seriously, mom, gain some weight.
That's very sweet.
Hey, look, these kids seem like they're having a good time.
- Why don't you go say hi.
- No way.
Stacy's little brother's over there.I don't want him putting thee moves on me.
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about Tristan.
He's very gentle.
Go talk to them.
Okay, cutie.Miss me.
Hey, guys.
You buzzing about my mom?
Um, no.
Why did you invite your mom?
Wow!
Where to begin.She drinks light tea.
She's met Dan rather.
She knows how to clean silk.
Should I keep going?
No, we're good.
You guys ever heard of France?
She's got a coffee table book about it.
We don't want to talk about your mom, bedelia.
We're playing truth or dare.
Okay.
I dare you to find a woman who strikes a better balance between work and family.
- Are you talking about your mom again?
- You get it.
She gets it.
Bye.
Ouch!
Turn your hair down.
- What?
- Seriously, mom.
It's got mad volume.
So are you nearing menopause?
- Bedelia, we're not talking about that.
- Okay.
Hey, flash me those caps.
- Oh, honey.
- Come on.
Whoomp there it is.
Know thy self mom, you're a milf.
- Excuse me?
- Mom I'd like to friend.
Oh, look.
A couple of boys from your class just sneaked in through the basement window.
Wow, so much of the effectiveness of that psloman shield sign out front.
- Just go say hi.
- Okay.
Bye, sexy.
Never have I ever made out with Trisha fagan.
- You did, too?
- I'm so horny.
This is the bomb!
Hey, guys.
Better keep it pg.
My mom's got her binocs on us.
- You brought yoor mom to this?
- Oh, yeah.
She's the best.
She reuses ziploc bags.
She dry shaves.
I'm, like, sign me up.
Stop talking about your mom.
We don't care.
Okay.
Well, if you change your mind, mom's over there.
She took a class about web design.******
- ******
- Your loss.
Bye.
Whoa, someone's face doesn't need a dictionary.
- What?
- Seriously, mom, your cheekbones are defined.
All right, bedelia, I think we need to spend more time apart.
Wait.
What are you saying?
I love you, but you shouldn't want to hang out with me so much.
What are you talking about?
You're so cool.
I'm not cool.
I bought this coat at sears.
It's a great fit at a sensible rice.
Honey, I take calcium pills.
Yeah and your kkck-ass bone density reflects that.
Bedelia, I'm going home.
If you leave me, I have nobody.
That's not true, sweetheart.
If you just let these kids get to see what I see, a beautiful person.
- Hey, guss.
- Hi.
Can I get a ride with you?
I'd rather go home and play pyahtzee with my mom.
She's one in a million.She's like - she's one of those ladies who's got the legs of Cheryl tiegs and the easy charm of Craig ferguson.
Mine too!
Hey, mom, can I go upstairs and close mouth kiss this guy?
Yes, please.
Nothing would make me happier.
Hey, does your mom like jazz cd's at Starbucks?
You kids hiding beer down here?
I know you are
I need one

this week on "bravo," it's an all-new "pregnant in heels."
Hi, I'm Rosie pope.******
I provide my clients with anything they want, no matter how extreme.
And she's got her work cut out for her with millionaire mommy-to-be shoshanna bunt.
**********************
I love being pregnant.
I've already lost 35 pounds.
- Watch Rosie deal with lots of questions.
- I'm sorry, what's wrong with your voice?
I was born in england, then moved to America.
And every morning 1,000 bees sting my tongue.
- And lots of demands.
- Rosie, when my baby is born,
I want to make sure the delivery room is total vips.
- No fatties.
- Perfect.
- *****
- Perfect.
- ***
- Perfect.
********************* and I want to have a water birth, but instead of water, I want diet coke.
And we have this guy.
I am not so much a person as I am a collection of choices.
I just found out that babies are born naked, which is disgusting.
I'm way ahead of you.
Prop your legs up and I'll get this outfit to the baby.
Don't worry, it's just like building a ship in a bottle.
Plus, we'll pad the boring moments with signature bravo music.
And cut to a dog.
Perfect.
Rosie's the best.
She even got a celebrity to make a personal appearance in my ultrasound.
Rosie's even there on the big day.
It's a boy.
Don't cut the cord.
I might want to return it.
- Thanks r, rosie!
- ****
I did not help at all.
***** only on bravo.
Right after an all-new "loud old bitches" and "America's next dumb gay guy."
How you doing?
Prom is come being up.
Who you going to go with?
A parent?
Don't restrict yourself.
I want you to look dateable.
Doogie, don't proms cost an arm and a leg or more?
Good point.
That's why you need to come to my slightly damaged prom wear barn.
Googie rene's
********************************
I love the color of this dress.
Well, you should.
It's alive with color.
But I don't love all the grass stains in the butt area.
Well, that's because the previous owner had to scoot home through a field.
I went to prom once and they closed the beachers on me.
**************************** what do I do about the stains?
Well, just always be backing up and laughing like you just heard a joke that was too much it's not rocket problems.
Thanks, doogie.
Great idea.
Look at this, doogie.
What are you?
*******
I'm at the accessooy wall.
Don't go places without telling me first.******
at doogie renees, you'll find a cummerbund.**** what is that?
**** no*********
- ******
- It was originally used to catch crumbs.
Like a small bird underneath a icnic table.
- ***
- You taught me something today.
*****
- hey, doogie.
- Hang on.
I'm coming.
I'm totally down with this mad-ass tux, but what are all these brown ones.
***********
- *****************
- If we can't fix your stain, we'll give you an autograph of Julie chen to hold in front of it.
- Now I'm ready for my first kiss from a girl.
- I am, too.
Are you on drugs?
Stty on part.
Listen to this satisfied woman.
Doogie Renee, I have been invited to prom by my oldest friend's son.
This is an opportunity I could not pass up.
When I arrived, people pointed.
I knew I had done something wrong.
I paid doogie $5 for this prom dress, and people thought I paid twice that.
************ sorry*** thank you for the wonderful clearance.
It sounds like you are the shia.
This is about savings.
It's mother's day.
And there's no better way to express your feelings than hallmark.
Because every mother is special.
But your mother is most special of all.
Because of you in a dress.
Introducing the hallmark mother collection.
For weirdos.
Because you're not just a good son.
You're also a wonderful mother.
So show yourself you care.
Because your mother will never leave you as long as you keep dressing like her and talking like her
and being a good boy.
Because you're crazy about mother.
The hallmaak mother collection.
**************
thanks to Ellie goulding, maya Rudolph.
Everyone have a great happy moth mother's day.
Be nice to your mother tomorrow.
Saturday night liveseason 36 episode20
(Wooden swords clacking)
Yah!
Left high, left low.
(Swords clanging, men shouting)
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
- What is...
- (Screaming)
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- Hush!
- (Swords clanging, men yelling)
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
- (Man) This way!
- (Door banging)
(Screaming)
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.
I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
(Door opens)
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
(Laughs) Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
- (Wood clatters)
- What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
(Men moaning)
(Swords ringing) (Men screaming)
Not today.
Not today.
(Gasps)
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the queen.
(Chuckles) Who do you think sent me?
(Horses neighing)
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
- Stay away!
- (Gasps)
(Door clanging, creaking)
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
(Door creaks, clangs)
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
(Sniffs) What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
(Varys) Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
(Pycelle) A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
(Sighs)
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
(Cawing)
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
(Tyrion whistling a tune)
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price,
I'll beat it.
I like living.
(Whistles)
- (Rustling) - (Bronn whispers) Tyrion.
Tyrion.
(Birds chirp, flutter)
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
(Laughing)
(All laughing)
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
(Crow cawing)
(Ser Alliser) Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
(Barking, whining)
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is someone out there?
(Whining and growling)
(Snarling)
(Growling)
Commander?
(Barks, whines)
Stay.
Hello?
- Who's there?
- (Whines)
- Lord Commander?
- (Door slams)
(Barking)
(Growling)
(Mormont) Snow?
Commander!
(Yelps)
(Screaming)
Move!
(Men yelling, women screaming)
(Grunts)
(Screaming and yelling continue)
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
(Daenerys) I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
(Women screaming)
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khai.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
(Rakharo speaks Dothraki)
- Come.
- (Man speaks Dothraki)
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
(Man speaks Dothraki)
(Dothraki continues)
(Drogo speaks Dothraki)
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
(Drogo snickers)
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
(Speaks Dothraki)
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
(Speaks English) Thank you, silver lady.
(Speaks English) Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
(Men chatting)
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters,
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
(Snarls)
(Screaming)
(Snap) (Screams)
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
(Jon Umber chortles)
(All laughing)
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
(Bran) Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
- Open your ears.
- (Leaves rustling)
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you. (Sighs)
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
(Running footsteps)
(Osha giggles) Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- (Laughs)
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
- The cold winds are rising.
- (Leaves rustling)
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
(Men chattering in camp)
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
(Rodrik) The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
(Grunting)
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
(Growls)
Oi.
(Pycelle) It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
...and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
(Lords mutter)
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride
- on your many years of service.
- (Murmuring)
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
(Joffrey) You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
(Laughter)
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
(Doors creak, clang)
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
(Steward) The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.

Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
What is--
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you-- watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the God of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll-
- I'll tell the Queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me-- the Queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though-- all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers-- a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that-- what will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On-- on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son--
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My-- my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight-- not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move move!
What did they do?
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Man:
Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Me Fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
Ohos.
Os.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his--
lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I--
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book-- a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up--
And when they wake up, what?
I hope The Wall is high enough.
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey-- you would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope-- our only hope-- is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood-- and feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these...
Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
--Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces-- if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't b leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand--
My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- ...
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight.
I shall die a Knight.
A naked Knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise h never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
I'm giving you half of our forces.
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
We belong together.
When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
You must be gone by then.
There's no rider.
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Where's my Uncle?
- What's he got there?
- To me, Ghost.
Gods be good!
Renly:
Ned!
It's Robert.
We were hunting a boar.
Give it to the Council after I'm dead.
He named you Protector of the Realm.
She won't care.
Give me an hour and I can put 100 swords at your command.
Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls.
King Robert still wants me dead.
Jorah:
This poisoner was the first, he won't be the last.
( Grunts )
( Speaking Dothraki )
King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the throne room.
- King Joffrey?
- King Robert is gone.
Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son.
Your son has no claim to the throne.
Kill him!
Kill all of them, I command it!
( Screaming )
I did warn you not to trust me.

( Wooden swords clacking )
Yah!
Left high, left low.
( Swords clanging )
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
- What is-- - ( Screaming )
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- ( Swords clanging )
- Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
Man:
This way!
( Screaming )
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you--
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
( Door opens )
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
( Laughs ) Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
- Bloody oafs.
- ( Sword rings )
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The First Sword of Braavos does not run.
( Wood clatters )
What do we say to the God of Death?
Not today.
Go.
( Lannister men moaning )
- ( Swords ringing ) - ( Men screaming )
Not today.
Not today.
( Gasps )
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll-
- I'll tell the Queen.
( Chuckles ) Who do you think sent me?
( Horses neigh )
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me-- the Queen!
- Stay away!
- ( Gasps )
( Door clanging, creaking )
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though-- all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
( Door creaks, clangs )
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
( Sniffs )
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers-- a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
Pycelle:
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
( Huffs )
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that-- what will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On-- on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
( Cawing )
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son--
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
( Whistling a tune )
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
( Whistles )
- ( Rustling ) - ( Bronn whispers ) Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
( Birds chirp, flutter )
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
( Laughing )
( All laughing )
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My-- my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?

- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My... my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Now there's a rare sight... not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move move!
What did they do?
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Me fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer nemo vacchaki.
Ohos.
Ohos.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his...
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall is high enough.
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the south.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope...
our only hope... is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
...Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him...
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.

Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
What is...
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.
I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price,
I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is someone out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move!
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khai.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Come.
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters,
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
...and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
I'm giving you half of our forces.
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
We belong together.
When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
You must be gone by then.
There's no rider.
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Where's my Uncle?
- What's he got there?
- To me, Ghost.
Gods be good!
Renly:
Ned!
It's Robert.
We were hunting a boar.
Give it to the Council after I'm dead.
He named you Protector of the Realm.
She won't care.
Give me an hour and I can put 100 swords at your command.
Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls.
King Robert still wants me dead.
Jorah:
This poisoner was the first, he won't be the last.
( Grunts )
( Speaking Dothraki )
King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the throne room.
- King Joffrey?
- King Robert is gone.
Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son.
Your son has no claim to the throne.
Kill him!
Kill all of them, I command it!
( Screaming )
I did warn you not to trust me.

( Wooden swords clacking )
Yah!
Left high, left low.
( Swords clanging )
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
- What is-- - ( Screaming )
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- ( Swords clanging )
- Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
Man:
This way!
( Screaming )
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you--
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
( Door opens )
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
( Laughs ) Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
- Bloody oafs.
- ( Sword rings )
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The First Sword of Braavos does not run.
( Wood clatters )
What do we say to the God of Death?
Not today.
Go.
( Lannister men moaning )
- ( Swords ringing ) - ( Men screaming )
Not today.
Not today.
( Gasps )
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll-
- I'll tell the Queen.
( Chuckles ) Who do you think sent me?
( Horses neigh )
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me-- the Queen!
- Stay away!
- ( Gasps )
( Door clanging, creaking )
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though-- all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
( Door creaks, clangs )
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
( Sniffs )
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers-- a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
Pycelle:
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
( Huffs )
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that-- what will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On-- on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
( Cawing )
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son--
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
( Whistling a tune )
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
( Whistles )
- ( Rustling ) - ( Bronn whispers ) Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
( Birds chirp, flutter )
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
( Laughing )
( All laughing )
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My-- my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight-- not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
( Barking, whining )
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
( Whining growls )
( Snarling )
( Growling )
Commander?
( Barks, whines )
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
( Whines )
- Lord Commander?
- ( Door slams )
( Barking )
( Growling )
Mormont:
Snow?
Commander!
( Yelps )
Move move!
( Snarling, screaming )
( Grunts )
( Screaming, snarling continue )
What did they do?
( Rakharo speaking Dothraki )
Daenerys:
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
( Louder screaming )
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
( Rakharo speaking )
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
( Rakharo speaks )
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Man:
Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
( Speaks Dothraki )
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Man:
Me Fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Drogo:
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
( Drogo snickers )
( Spits )
( Drogo grunts ) Ohos.
Ohos.
( Gasps )
( Woman speaking Dothraki )
( Gasps )
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
( Spits )
My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his--
lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
( Men chatting, eating )
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
( Snarls )
( Screaming )
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel
- against your Liege Lord.
- ( Huffs )
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
( Chortles )
( All laughing )
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I--
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Bran:
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
( Leaves rustling )
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
( Sighs )
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
( Running footsteps )
( Osha giggles ) Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- ( Laughs )
- Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
( Leaves rustling )
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book-- a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up--
And when they wake up, what?
I hope The Wall is high enough.
( Men chattering )
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey-- you would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope-- our only hope-- is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood-- and feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these...
Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
--Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces-- if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
Rodrik:
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Theon:
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
( Grunting )
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand--
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
( Softly ) Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
( Growls )
Oi.
Pycelle:
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- ...
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
( Lords mutter )
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
( Murmuring )
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
Joffrey:
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight.
I shall die a Knight.
A naked Knight, apparently.
( Laughter )
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
( Doors creak, clang )
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
Steward:
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise h never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
( Music playing )
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
I'm giving you half of our forces.
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
We belong together.
When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
You must be gone by then.
There's no rider.
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Where's my Uncle?
- What's he got there?
- To me, Ghost.
Gods be good!
Ned!
It's Robert.
We were hunting a boar.
Give it to the Council after I'm dead.
He named you Protector of the Realm.
She won't care.
Give me an hour and I can put 100 swords at your command.
Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls.
King Robert still wants me dead.
This poisoner was the first, he won't be the last.
King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the throne room.
- King Joffrey?
- King Robert is gone.
Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son.
Your son has no claim to the throne.
Kill him!
Kill all of them, I command it!
I did warn you not to trust me.

Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
What is--
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you--
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The First Sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the God of Death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll-
- I'll tell the Queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me-- the Queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though-- all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers-- a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that-- what will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On-- on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son--
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My-- my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight-- not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move move!
What did they do?
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Man:
Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Me Fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
Ohos.
Ohos.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his--
lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I--
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book-- a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up--
And when they wake up, what?
I hope The Wall is high enough.
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey-- you would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope-- our only hope-- is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood-- and feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these...
Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
--Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces-- if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand--
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- ...
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight.
I shall die a Knight.
A naked Knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise h never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.

Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honour.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Mago!
Only while blood of my blood still lives.
- She is my prize.
I will take her with an arakh.
It's an insult!
Khaleesi will give me my prize or I will take it with my arakh.
She will speak before me; until then you will keep yourself quite.
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
Be still.
Don't move!
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honour.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones!
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is hurt.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Witch.
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here.
And one to my sister.
Inform her that she's to bring 500 men to Winterfell.
- When do we sail for King's Landing?
- Soon as I've consolidated my troops.
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
The fist of the First Men.
Thousands of years ago they stood here.
They came here to get away from something.
I don't think it worked.
Do you think I'll let you ship Myrcella off to Dorne?
Dorne is the safest place for her.
I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone before I take her from you.
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple?
And Rickon, too?
Gone, along with the wildling woman.
Wait, I know that farm.
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.
I've been treating your wounded men.
I've already run through the supplies.
You're riding to the Crag to a surrender.
Come with me to the Crag.
Let the Maester show you his stores.
Should have took me.
They want your head.
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
You strangled his son with your chains.
- He was in my way.
- You are a man without honor.
Your sword.
You have my dragons?
I'll take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.
I told you what would happen if you served me loyally and what would happen if you did not.
What have you done?
If there are any among you who question whether your lord means what he says...
- Rider approaching!
- Open the gate!
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?
You should be proud of your brother's achievement.
I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.
You're a great warrior.
I saw the bodies above your gates.
Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?
I treated the Stark boys with honor and they repaid me with treachery.
You treated them with honor by butchering them?
- Before I had to kill them...
- You seized their home.
We're Ironborn;
We take what we need.
Exactly.
Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.
Is that treachery?
I'd call it bravery.
They made me a promise...
Your prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it?
Are you the dumbest cunt?
- Don't call me a...
- A cunt.
A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.
You know how valuable those boys were?
If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.
You are weak.
- I'm warning you.
- And you're stupid.
Go on, then, warn me.
You haven't brought enough men.
How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
You're not.
I've come to bring you home.
- Father wants a word.
Is this a joke?
Winterfell is the heart of the North.
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?
Our power comes from our ships.
And now that you'vedecorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged.
- When Robb Stark finds out...
- He won't.
We've killed all the ravens.
We have all the horses.
I've taken Winterfell.
And I will keep Winterfell.
Leave us.
Theon, you're my blood.
We both loved our mother.
We both endured our father.
Come home with me.
Don't die here alone.
I don't intend to die.
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.
And one night you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig.
I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you.
I wanted to strangle you.
And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.
You smiled at me.
Don't die so far from the sea.
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.
I already got one crow.
Don't need two.
Mance will want to question this one.
Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.
Gut him.
He could have killed me half a dozen times.
And now he wishes he did.
Gut him.
He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.
Mance will want him.
What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
I don't know.
I think he'll want to decide for himself.
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.
He runs, I'll do it meself.
We're even now, Jon Snow.
I couldn't do it.
- I had the sword at her neck...
- I know.
The others?
When you didn't come back, we went looking for you.
We found your tracks fast enough.
But they found us before we found you.
They died because of me.
See that it wasn't for nothing.
Come on, on your feet, now.
Is she beautiful?
I've never met her.
What's her name?
Frey, I suppose.
I don't know her first name.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
- And you're marrying her for a bridge?
- An important bridge.
It was before they killed my father.
I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.
When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father.
He was the best man I ever met.
I know children always think that about their fathers, but--
Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me.
He once told me that being a Lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them.
The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect.
The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect.
The soldiers you order into battle.
He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night.
I didn't believe him.
I asked him,
"how can a man be brave if he's afraid?"
"That is the only time a man can be brave," he told me.
I wish I could have met him.
He would have liked you.
Most Lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen .
He didn't care much about gold or glory.
And you?
You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me?
I want to go home.
- I want my men to go home.
- Then why don't you?
Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated.
- And because I believe in justice.
- Chopping of Joffrey's head, you mean.
That would be a start.
Your Grace, Milady.
The Kingslayer,
- he escaped in the night.
- How?
How?
!
Tell me this isn't true.
Why?
- For the girls.
- You betrayed me.
You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.
Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.
I have five children, and only one of them is free.
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.
I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain.
You commit treason because your children are prisoners?
I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.
I grieve for your sons, My Lord.
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.
And you stole it from me.
Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.
You've weakened our position.
You've brought discord into our camp.
And you did it all behind my back.
Make sure she's guarded day and night.
How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
40, Your Grace.
Send another 40 with our fastest horses.
Damn.
You're much uglier in daylight.
What's your name?
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.
A captive Knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
Brienne of Tarth.
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.
Crescent moons and starbursts.
Lord...
Selwyn Tarth, your father.
Do you have any brothers and sisters, My Lady?
It's a long way to King's Landing.
Might as well get to know one another.
Have you known many men?
I suppose not.
Women?
Horses?
I didn't mean to give offense.
Forgive me.
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.
Why do you hate me so much?
- Have I ever harmed you?
- You've harmed others... those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.
Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
You will not provoke me to anger.
I already have.
Look at you.
You're ready to chop my head off.
Do you think you could?
Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
I've never seen you fight.
The answer is no.
There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me.
You're not one of them.
All my life men like you have sneered at me.
And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.
Do you take me for an idiot?
In.
I took you for a fighter, a man... pardon... woman of honor.
Was I wrong?
You're afraid.
Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.
King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force.
It's not too late for Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
Surrender the Iron Throne?
Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates.
Stannis will execute them all.
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.
Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.
The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap.
Which is why my son is his prisoner.
Too close to Casterly Rock.
He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell.
The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.
He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
We'll ride at nightfall.
I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move.
Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal.
Track down this brotherhood and destroy them.
The girl has proven herself a good servant.
She'll stay on with you.
See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.
He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.
You've got some questions to answer.
Who killed Ser Amory?
- I don't know!
- Give me the name.
Take this one out for the crows.
I told you, I don't know.
Please.
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.
Where's Jaqen?
Don't care.
Where's your stick now, bitch?
I promised to fuck you with it.
Time to kill some wolves.
You need sour cherries to make it right.
And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet.
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.
And when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
- Where's Jaqen?
- How would I know?
I need him now.
Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
You need him?
He's helping me.
- I saw him.
- Where?
Where?
They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
On patrol.
Let go of my ears.
What do you want with him anyway?
Mance is gonna march on the Wall.
When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?
How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
I didn't.
I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard.
He's not yours to kill, crow.
Do you have to do that here?
I like to keep me hands clean.
Yes, but do you have to do it here?
- Start wearing the gold cloak.
- I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
You're commander of the City Watch.
- You shouldn't be dressed like a sellsword.
- A cloak slows you down in a fight, makes it hard to move quietly.
And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.
Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer.
- You're supposed to stand out.
- We had a deal.
- And wearing a cloak wasn't part of it.
- Fine, fine.
No gold cloak.
- What?
- What?
What?
What?
Why are you staring at me?
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.
Why am I here?
To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
Stannis will be here any day.
And one of these explains how to beat him?
"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros"
by Archmaester "Shevelathin."
"Shevelatesh."
"Chevalteesh."
I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
My Lord Hand, Commander.
I must compliment you on the Gold Cloaks' performance these last few weeks.
Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
I did not know.
And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
For questioning?
Uh, no.
It's the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.
Have you ever been in a city under siege?
Maybe this part's not in your books.
See, it's not the fighting that kills most people.
It's the starving.
Food's worth more than gold.
Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes.
Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.
The thieves, they love a siege.
Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food.
By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.
Given the circumstances, My Lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."
Thrilling subject.
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan wasn't a better writer.
Stannis knows King's Landing.
He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest.
The Mud Gate.
A good ram will batter it down in minutes and it's only 50 yards from the water.
That's where he'll land.
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?
- We could throw books at his men.
- We don't have that many books.
We don't have that many men, either.
What do we have?
Pig shit.
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world.
I can't imagine anything much worse.
You lack imagination.
Where do you think Jon is right now?
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.
A betting man would go with dead.
He's not dead.
No, Jon's a great fighter.
Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you.
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
So did his father.
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
Great rangers never get old is the problem.
Shit ones neither.
It's them in the middle that last a long time.
What in seven hells is that?
The First Men made these marks.
Help me with it.
Look.
If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it.
That's a Night's Watch cloak.
It's been here a long time.
- Must be Dragonglass.
- Dragonglass?
The Maesters call it Obsidian.
Why would a brother hide it here?
I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
Mind where you're going.
I'm sorry.
I'll...
- Where were you?
- A man has patrol duty.
Tywin Lannister was right here and now he's gone.
A girl owes one more name.
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.
How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
A minute, an hour, a month.
Death is certain, the time is not.
He's taking his army to attack my brother.
I need him dead right now.
This a man cannot do.
You promised you'd help me.
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.
There must be others.
Give a name, any name.
And you'll kill them?
Anybody?
By the seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting,
I swear it.
All right.
Jaqen H'ghar.
A girl gives a man his own name?
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.
A man can go kill himself.
- Un-name me.
- No.
Please?
I'll un-name you.
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.
This would require more than one life.
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.
A girl lacks honor.
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.
A girl will obey.
A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
Thank you, Podrick.
Odd little boy.
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
You and Varys both.
Excellent lamprey pie.
Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.
An inspiration for the troops.
The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
He's only a boy.
Younger boys are off fighting his war.
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.
Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't.
His place is not on the battlefield.
It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
- No, I'd say you possess above average intelligence.
- You shipped off my only daughter.
And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.
He has the finest armor gold can buy.
He needs to be out there.
The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.
Any dessert?
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
Because he has thousands of spies in his employ.
Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
Because he doesn't have a cock.
Neither do you.
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.
You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man.
That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.
It's not that little.
Why are you smiling?
Because I'm happy.
And why are you happy?
Because I have your little whore.
I thought you preferred blondes.
Such a droll little fellow.
Tell me, have you married this one yet?
No?
Oh, good.
Father will be so pleased.
Why do you care who I fuck?
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.
You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.
This is madness.
Stannis will be here in days.
You need me.
For what?
Your skill in battle?
Pretty thing, your whore.
Lovely body.
The bruises will heal in time.
Where did you find her?
Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?
You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.
You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
Well, you're the expert.
Tell me.
You don't buy them;
You only rent them.
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.
This one you like.
You like her very much.
Could it be love?
Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough... unless Joffrey is hurt.
And then every wound he suffers she'll suffer, too.
And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.
And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
Would you like to see her?
I thought you might.
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.
I'm sorry they hurt you.
You must be brave.
I promise I will free you.
Don't forget me.
Never.
I will hurt you for this.
A day will come when you think you're safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
And you will know the debt is paid.
Get out.
I've been waiting all night.
What is wrong?
You're beautiful.
Then why do you look sad?
- We have to be more careful.
- Don't be afraid.
I can take care of myself.
There are people who want to hurt me.
I know.
I won't let them.
I'll cut off their faces.
I will.
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?
I expect I'll have to before this is over.
You're mine.
I'm yours.
Promise me.
I'm yours, and you are mine.
Still no word?
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
Once he captures the castle--
Theon has my brothers.
If we storm the castle--
He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.
They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
Send word to your son.
Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
- Too much--
- Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.
He betrayed our cause.
He betrayed me.
And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
His countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
Your pardon, My Lord.
Your Grace.
How are you?
How am I?
I've had to arrest my mother.
The Lannisters have my sisters.
The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers.
I don't know if I should march South or North.
I'm sorry.
It was a stupid question.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
You're being kind.
- I have no right.
- You have every right.
- You're a King.
- That's not the King I want to be.
- What kind do you want to be?
- I don't know.
The good kind.
Most kings grew up as princes.
They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.
- I'd like to hear you play the harp.
- No, you would not.
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding.
Weddings in Volantis last for days.
And they left me with my little brother.
The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the 3-year summer.
We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne.
Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.
The rich, the poor, we were all there, naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.
Drummers were playing for coppers on the East Bank.
I was treading water, talking to a friend when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.
I called his name.
Then I started screaming his name.
And then I saw him floating facedown.
My heart just stopped.
I was...
I dragged him from the water.
My friend helped me, I think.
I don't even remember.
He was so little.
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank... and I screamed at him and I shook him
and he was dead.
Just dead.
A man ran over.
He had a fish tattoo on his face.
In Volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them.
And this man worked on a fishing boat.
And he pushed me out of the way.
You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl... that's death for the man, a terrible death.
But he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again
until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne
and cried out.
And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.
I decided two things that day.
I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.
And when I came of age...
I would never live in a slave city again.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
I don't want you to marry her.
But you needed that bridge.
I hope it's a beautiful bridge.
The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
- Shut up.
- Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven, the nice warm oven.
Shut up.
What did you bring?
The cheese could be better.
Some nice sausages.
What did he want us to do about those guards?
He just said, "Walk through the gates.
What about the guards?
He didn't say anything.
What, he left that bit out?
It's a pretty important part.
- We have to trust him.
- Trust him?
You trusted him to fight with us and you set him free and he ran.
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.
Stay here if you're afraid.
Arry, don't.
Away!
Reset!
If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.
Will it hold?
Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.
I admire you, Ser Davos.
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you.
So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.
My son wishes me to change it.
Three mermen with tridents, something like that.
I understand why the older families look down at me.
Do you?
Why?
- My father was a crabber.
- And?
Well, sons of Lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers.
- Our hands stink.
- Where were they when Storm's End starved?
Many fought bravely for your brother.
Many fought for the Mad King.
You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
Some are happy to do it to my face.
We were forgotten.
Robert and Ned Stark... they were the heroes, the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King while I held Storm's End with 500 men.
- No one has forgotten.
- No?
Robert did.
He gave Storm's End to Renly.
Renly never fought a day in his life.
He was only a boy.
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
First we ate the horses.
We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded.
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.
Then the cats.
Never liked cats.
So fine.
I do like dogs.
Good animals.
Loyal.
But we ate them.
Then the rats.
The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying.
She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.
And then you made it through the lines.
Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.
And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.
Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
I was relieved they did not.
Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it.
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up.
Insult or no, I gave it up because Robert was my brother, the King, and I've always done my duty.
But now I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros.
And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.
I serve you well.
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
You're the master of whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.
No man can be in all rooms at all times.
I have many little birds in the North, My Lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.
To strike?
My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege?
You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores,
- I'll ride out to greet him.
- A brave choice, Your Grace.
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.
They say Stannis never smiles.
I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
Imagine Stannis's terror.
I am trying.
You're an intelligent man.
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.
I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.
I wish we could, too.
What do you want?
Tell me.
If we're going to play, you'll have to start.
My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.
My sister became Queen at the age of 19.
When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
A most highborn plumber.
The water never flowed better.
And all the shit found its way to the sea.
I never expected to have any real power.
- So when my father named me Hand...
- You're good at being Hand, you know?
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men, honorable men, but they disdained the game and those who played.
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.
Last thing I expected.
- And you play it well.
- I'd like to keep playing it.
If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.
They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
The Lord of Light wants enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned.
Why are all the Gods such vicious cunts?
Where is the God of tits and wine?
In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.
We should sail there immediately.
This morning I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.
Daenerys Targaryen lives.
A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
She has three dragons.
But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are grown.
And then there will be nowhere to hide.
One game at a time, my friend.
Careful, Khaleesi.
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have 1,000 eyes watching for you.
I found one... a ship with a good captain.
- She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
- Astapor?
We cannot stay here.
A mother does not flee without her children.
They're not your children.
They call you the Mother of Dragons, but you didn't grow them in your womb.
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.
- And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.
- You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.
You know I would die for you.
I will never abandon you.
- I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.
- Then serve me.
If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.
That's what the warlock wants.
He told you so himself.
If you enter that place, you will never leave again.
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?
You saw me step into the fire.
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?
Until my last breath I will remember.
After I have forgotten my mother's face.
They are my children.
And they are the only children I will ever have.
Take me to them.
We should bury them.
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.
If they haven't got the message, a few more days won't help.
As you say.
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.
- For his trouble.
- His troubles are done.
He's feeding the crops now.
His wife, too.
You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.
Got as far as the farm and then doubled back.
Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.
Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
You're right so far.
Who was that out there hung up the gates?
Must have been the farmer's boys.
He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
They mustn't know.
Bran would blame himself.
They'll never hear it from me.
The little lads have suffered enough.
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honour.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honour.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Witch.
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
Game of Thrones 1x07 The Pointy End Original Air Date on June 5, 2011
Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
What is...
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The First Sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the God of Death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the Queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me...
the Queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you...
the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If... if I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On... on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My... my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Now there's a rare sight... not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move move!
What did they do?
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Me fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer nemo vacchaki.
Ohos.
Ohos.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his...
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall is high enough.
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the south.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope...
our only hope... is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
...Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him...
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.

Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
What is--
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you-- watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the God of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll-
- I'll tell the Queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me-- the Queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though-- all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers-- a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that-- what will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On-- on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son--
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My-- my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight-- not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move move!
What did they do?
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Man:
Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Me Fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
Ohos.
Os.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his--
lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I--
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book-- a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up--
And when they wake up, what?
I hope The Wall is high enough.
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey-- you would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope-- our only hope-- is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood-- and feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these...
Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
--Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces-- if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't b leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand--
My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- ...
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight.
I shall die a Knight.
A naked Knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise h never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.

LEFT HIGH, LEFT LOW.
RIGHT LOW,
LUNGE RIGHT.
YOU BREAK ANYTHING, THE SEPTA WILL HAVE MY HEAD.
YOUR SISTER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WE WERE TO LEAVE TODAY.
- HOW SHE COULD FORGET...
- SHE DIDN'T FORGET.
SHE'S WITH HER DANCING MASTER.
SHE'S WITH HIM EVERY MORNING.
SHE ALWAYS COMES BACK WITH SCRAPES AND BRUISES.
SHE'S SO CLUMSY.
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM.
BAR THE DOORS
AND DO NOT OPEN THEM FOR ANYONE YOU DO NOT KNOW.
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- DO AS I TOLD YOU.
RUN!
LEFT, RIGHT.
NOW YOU ARE DEAD.
YOU SAID RIGHT,
- BUT YOU WENT LEFT.
- AND NOW YOU ARE A DEAD GIRL.
ONLY 'CAUSE YOU LIED.
MY TONGUE LIED.
MY EYES SHOUTED THE TRUTH.
- YOU WERE NOT SEEING.
- I WAS SO.
- I WATCHED, BUT YOU...
- WATCHING IS NOT SEEING, DEAD GIRL.
THE SEEING,
THE TRUE SEEING,
THAT IS THE HEART OF SWORDPLAY.
ARYA STARK,
COME WITH US.
YOUR FATHER WANTS TO SEE YOU.
AND WHY IS IT THAT LORD EDDARD
IS SENDING LANNISTER MEN IN PLACE OF HIS OWN?
I AM WONDERING.
MIND YOUR PLACE, DANCING MASTER.
- THIS IS NO CONCERN OF YOURS.
- MY FATHER WOULDN'T SEND YOU.
AND I DON'T HAVE TO GO WITH YOU IF I DON'T WANT.
- TAKE HER.
- ARE YOU MEN OR SNAKES,
THAT YOU WOULD THREATEN A CHILD?
GET OUT OF MY WAY, LITTLE MAN.
I AM SYRIO FOREL...
FOREIGN BASTARD.
AND YOU WILL BE SPEAKING TO ME WITH MORE RESPECT.
KILL THE BRAAVOSI.
BRING THE GIRL.
ARYA CHILD, WE ARE DONE WITH DANCING FOR THE DAY.
RUN TO YOUR FATHER.
BLOODY OAFS.
BE GONE NOW, ARYA.
COME WITH ME.
RUN.
THE FIRST SWORD OF BRAAVOS DOES NOT RUN.
WHAT DO WE SAY TO THE GOD OF DEATH?
NOT TODAY.
GO.
NOT TODAY.
NOT TODAY.
STAY AWAY FROM ME.
I'LL TELL MY FATHER.
I'LL TELL THE QUEEN.
WHO DO YOU THINK SENT ME?
NEEDLE.
THERE SHE IS.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I WANT YOU, WOLF GIRL.
- COME HERE.
- LEAVE ME BE.
- MY FATHER'S A LORD.
HE'LL REWARD YOU.
- SHE'LL REWARD ME...
THE QUEEN!
STAY AWAY!
LORD STARK,
YOU MUST BE THIRSTY.
I PROMISE YOU IT ISN'T POISONED.
WHY IS IT NO ONE EVER TRUSTS THE EUNUCH?
NOT SO MUCH, MY LORD.
I WOULD SAVE THE REST, IF I WERE YOU.
HIDE IT.
MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DIE OF THIRST IN THESE CELLS.
WHAT ABOUT MY DAUGHTERS?
THE YOUNGER ONE SEEMS TO HAVE ESCAPED THE CASTLE.
EVEN MY LITTLE BIRDS CANNOT FIND HER.
- AND SANSA?
- STILL ENGAGED TO JOFFREY.
CERSEI WILL KEEP HER CLOSE.
THE REST OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD THOUGH...
ALL DEAD, IT GRIEVES ME TO SAY.
I DO SO HATE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.
YOU WATCHED MY MEN BEING SLAUGHTERED AND DID NOTHING.
AND WOULD AGAIN, MY LORD.
I WAS UNARMED, UNARMORED AND SURROUNDED BY LANNISTER SWORDS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME DO YOU SEE A HERO?
WHAT MADNESS LED YOU TO TELL THE QUEEN
YOU HAD LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT JOFFREY'S BIRTH?
THE MADNESS OF MERCY.
- THAT SHE MIGHT SAVE HER CHILDREN.
- THE CHILDREN.
IT IS ALWAYS THE INNOCENTS WHO SUFFER.
IT WASN'T THE WINE THAT KILLED ROBERT, NOR THE BOAR.
THE WINE SLOWED HIM DOWN AND THE BOAR RIPPED HIM OPEN,
BUT IT WAS YOUR MERCY THAT KILLED THE KING.
I TRUST YOU KNOW YOU ARE A DEAD MAN, LORD EDDARD?
THE QUEEN CAN'T KILL ME.
CAT HOLDS HER BROTHER.
THE WRONG BROTHER SADLY.
AND LOST TO HER.
YOUR WIFE HAS LET THE IMP SLIP THROUGH HER FINGERS.
IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN SLIT MY THROAT AND BE DONE WITH IT.
NOT TODAY, MY LORD.
TELL ME SOMETHING, VARYS.
WHO DO YOU TRULY SERVE?
THE REALM, MY LORD.
SOMEONE MUST.
IT'S OTHOR,
WITHOUT A DOUBT.
THE OTHER ONE IS JAFER FLOWERS,
LESS THE HAND THE WOLF TORE OFF.
ANY SIGN OF BENJEN
OR THE REST OF HIS PARTY?
JUST THESE TWO, MY LORD.
BEEN DEAD AWHILE, I'D SAY.
THE SMELL.
WHAT SMELL?
THERE IS NONE.
IF THEY'D BE DEAD FOR A LONG TIME, WOULDN'T THERE BE ROT?
- WE SHOULD BURN THEM.
- SNOW'S NOT WRONG, MY LORD.
FIRE WILL DO FOR THEM.
THE WILDLING WAY.
I WANT MAESTER AEMON TO EXAMINE THEM FIRST.
YOU MAY BE A COWARD, TARLY, BUT YOU'RE NOT STUPID.
GET THEM INSIDE.
YOU HEARD HIM.
LORD COMMANDER,
MAESTER AEMON AWAITS YOU IN HIS CHAMBERS...
A RAVEN FROM KING'S LANDING.
COME ON, MOVE 'EM OUT.
BRING ME A HORN OF ALE, SNOW,
AND POUR ONE FOR YOURSELF.
THE KING IS DEAD.
IS THERE ANY WORD OF MY FATHER?
SIT.
LORD STARK HAS BEEN
CHARGED WITH TREASON.
THEY SAY HE CONSPIRED WITH ROBERT'S BROTHERS
TO DENY THE THRONE TO PRINCE JOFFREY.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF DOING ANYTHING STUPID.
YOUR DUTY LIES HERE NOW.
MY SISTERS WERE IN KING'S LANDING TOO.
I'M SURE THEY'LL BE
TREATED GENTLY.
YOUR FATHER HAS PROVED TO BE AN AWFUL TRAITOR, DEAR.
KING ROBERT'S BODY WAS STILL WARM
WHEN LORD EDDARD BEGAN PLOTTING TO STEAL JOFFREY'S RIGHTFUL THRONE.
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HE KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE JOFFREY.
HE WOULDN'T.
PLEASE, YOUR GRACE, THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
SEND FOR MY FATHER.
HE'LL TELL YOU...
THE KING WAS HIS FRIEND.
SANSA SWEETLING, YOU ARE INNOCENT OF ANY WRONG.
WE KNOW THAT.
YET YOU ARE THE DAUGHTER OF A TRAITOR.
HOW CAN I ALLOW YOU TO MARRY MY SON?
A CHILD BORN OF A TRAITOR'S SEED
IS NO FIT CONSORT FOR OUR KING.
SHE IS A SWEET THING NOW, YOUR GRACE,
BUT IN 10 YEARS, WHO KNOWS WHAT TREASONS SHE MAY HATCH?
NO, I'M NOT.
I'LL BE A GOOD WIFE TO HIM, YOU'LL SEE.
I'LL BE A QUEEN JUST LIKE YOU, I PROMISE.
I WON'T HATCH ANYTHING.
THE GIRL IS INNOCENT, YOUR GRACE.
SHE SHOULD BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO PROVE HER LOYALTY.
LITTLE DOVE,
YOU MUST WRITE TO LADY CATELYN
AND YOUR BROTHER, THE ELDEST, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
ROBB.
WORD OF YOUR FATHER'S ARREST WILL REACH HIM SOON, NO DOUBT.
BEST IT COMES FROM YOU.
IF YOU WOULD HELP YOUR FATHER, URGE YOUR BROTHER TO KEEP THE KING'S PEACE.
TELL HIM TO COME TO KING'S LANDING AND SWEAR HIS FEALTY TO JOFFREY.
IF I COULD SEE MY FATHER, TALK TO HIM ABOUT...
YOU DISAPPOINT ME, CHILD.
WE HAVE TOLD YOU OF YOUR FATHER'S TREASON.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO A TRAITOR?
I ONLY MEANT THAT...
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIM?
THAT DEPENDS.
ON...
- ON WHAT?
- ON YOUR BROTHER.
AND ON YOU.
TREASON?
SANSA WROTE THIS?
IT IS YOUR SISTER'S HAND, BUT THE QUEEN'S WORDS.
YOU ARE SUMMONED TO KING'S LANDING TO SWEAR FEALTY TO THE NEW KING.
JOFFREY PUTS MY FATHER IN CHAINS, NOW HE WANTS HIS ASS KISSED?
THIS IS A ROYAL COMMAND, MY LORD.
- IF YOU SHOULD REFUSE TO OBEY...
- I WON'T REFUSE.
HIS GRACE SUMMONS ME TO KING'S LANDING, I'LL GO TO KING'S LANDING.
BUT NOT ALONE.
CALL THE BANNERS.
ALL OF THEM, MY LORD?
THEY'VE ALL SWORN TO DEFEND MY FATHER?
THEY HAVE.
NOW WE SEE WHAT THEIR WORDS ARE WORTH.
ARE YOU AFRAID?
I MUST BE.
GOOD.
WHY IS THAT GOOD?
IT MEANS YOU'RE NOT STUPID.
YOU'VE HAD THIS SINCE DAWN?
HE SENT IT TO ME, NOT YOU.
- I'VE SHOWN IT TO YOU AS A COURTESY.
- A COURTESY?
!
MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN TAKEN PRISONER.
MY SON INTENDS TO DECLARE WAR.
A WAR?
YOUR SON AGAINST THE LANNISTERS?
YOU SHOULD GO TO HIM.
TEACH HIM PATIENCE.
NED ROTS IN A DUNGEON AND YOU SPEAK OF PATIENCE?
HE IS YOUR BROTHER BY LAW!
DOES FAMILY MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?
FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.
AND I WILL NOT RISK ROBIN'S LIFE
TO GET CAUGHT UP IN ANOTHER OF YOUR HUSBAND'S WARS.
I'M HUNGRY.
HUSH NOW, DARLING.
YOU JUST ATE.
YOU WILL NOT SUPPORT US THEN?
DO I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY?
- BUT I'M HUNGRY!
- SOON, LOVE, SOON.
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME HERE, SISTER.
BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SEND MEN FROM THE VALE TO FIGHT...
THAT IS WHAT I ASK.
GO ON, SWEET.
TIME FOR YOUR BATH.
I'LL FEED YOU AFTER.
IF YOU FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR SON...
OF COURSE I FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF MY SON!
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?
THEY KILLED MY HUSBAND.
YOU SAY THEY SHOVED YOUR BOY FROM A WINDOW.
THESE PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING.
AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO STOP THEM.
THE KNIGHTS OF THE VALE WILL STAY IN THE VALE
WHERE THEY BELONG,
TO PROTECT THEIR LORD.
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
THERE'S HILL TRIBES ALL AROUND HERE.
IF I'M GOING TO DIE, IT MAYS AS WELL BE WITH A SONG IN MY HEART.
I SHOULD JUST TAKE YOUR FOOD AND LEAVE YOU HERE.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN?
STARVE, MOST LIKELY.
YOU DON'T THINK I'D DO IT, DO YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BRONN?
GOLD?
WOMEN?
GOLDEN WOMEN?
STICK WITH ME AND YOU'LL HAVE THEM ALL,
FOR AS LONG AS I'M AROUND AND NOT FOR A MOMENT LONGER.
BUT YOU KNEW THAT.
THAT IS WHY YOU SO VALIANTLY TOOK UP ARMS TO DEFEND MY HONOR.
FAIR ENOUGH.
BUT DON'T GO LOOKING FOR ME TO BEND THE KNEE
AND "MY LORD" YOU EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A SHIT.
I'M NOT YOUR TOADY AND I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.
THOUGH I WOULD TREASURE YOUR FRIENDSHIP,
I'M MAINLY INTERESTED IN YOUR FACILITY WITH MURDER.
AND IF THE DAY EVER COMES WHEN YOU'RE TEMPTED TO SELL ME OUT,
REMEMBER THIS:
WHATEVER THEIR PRICE,
I'LL BEAT IT.
I LIKE LIVING.
COME, SHARE OUR FIRE.
HELP YOURSELVES TO OUR GOAT.
WHEN YOU MEET YOUR GODS, YOU TELL THEM
SHAGGA SON OF DOLF
OF THE STONE CROWS SENT YOU.
I AM TYRION SON OF TYWIN OF CLAN LANNISTER.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO DIE, TYRION SON OF TYWIN?
IN MY OWN BED, AT THE AGE OF 80
WITH A BELLY FULL OF WINE AND A GIRL'S MOUTH AROUND MY COCK.
TAKE THE HALF MAN.
HE CAN DANCE FOR THE CHILDREN.
KILL THE OTHER ONE.
MY HOUSE IS RICH AND POWERFUL.
IF YOU SEE US THROUGH THESE MOUNTAINS,
MY FATHER WILL SHOWER YOU WITH GOLD.
WE HAVE NO USE FOR A HALF MAN'S PROMISES.
HALF A MAN MAYBE, BUT AT LEAST I HAVE THE COURAGE TO FACE MY ENEMIES.
WHAT DO THE STONE CROWS DO?
HIDE BEHIND ROCKS
AND SHIVER WHEN THE KNIGHTS OF THE VALE RIDE BY?
ARE THOSE THE BEST WEAPONS YOU COULD STEAL?
GOOD ENOUGH FOR KILLING SHEEP, IF THE SHEEP DON'T FIGHT BACK.
LANNISTER SMITHS SHIT BETTER STEEL.
YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN US OVER WITH YOUR TRINKETS?
THAT TRINKET IS WORTH MORE THAN EVERYTHING YOUR TRIBE OWNS.
BUT IF YOU HELP US, SHAGGA SON OF DOLF,
I WILL NOT GIVE YOU TRINKETS.
I WILL GIVE YOU THIS.
WHAT IS "THIS"?
THE VALE OF ARRYN.
THE LORDS OF THE VALE HAVE ALWAYS SPAT UPON THE HILL TRIBES.
THE LORDS OF THE VALE WANT ME DEAD.
I BELIEVE IT IS TIME FOR NEW LORDS OF THE VALE.
NOW THERE'S A RARE SIGHT...
NOT ONLY A BASTARD, BUT A TRAITOR'S BASTARD.
STOP, PUT IT DOWN!
BLOOD WILL ALWAYS TELL.
YOU'LL HANG FOR THIS, BASTARD.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO ANYTHING STUPID.
YOU'RE CONFINED TO QUARTERS.
GO.
GHOST, WHAT'S WRONG?
IS SOMETHING OUT THERE?
COMMANDER?
STAY.
HELLO?
WHO'S THERE?
LORD COMMANDER?
MOVE!
WHAT DID THEY DO?
I THOUGHT THE DOTHRAKI DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MONEY.
GOLD TO HIRE SHIPS, PRINCESS,
SHIPS TO SAIL TO WESTEROS.
JORAH, MAKE THEM STOP.
YOU HEARD ME.
THESE MEN HAVE SHED BLOOD FOR THEIR KHAL.
NOW THEY CLAIM THEIR REWARDS.
YOU HAVE A GENTLE HEART, BUT THIS IS HOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.
I DO NOT HAVE A GENTLE HEART, SER.
COME.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT DONE WITH THEM?
- BRING HER TO ME.
AND THOSE WOMEN THERE.
YOU CANNOT CLAIM THEM ALL, PRINCESS.
I CAN,
AND I WILL.
THANK YOU, SILVER LADY.
WHO ARE YOU?
I AM NAMED MIRRI MAZ DUUR.
I WAS THE GODSWIFE OF THIS TEMPLE.
MY MOTHER WAS GODSWIFE HERE BEFORE ME.
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE HEALING SMOKES AND OINTMENTS.
ALL MEN ARE OF ONE FLOCK, SO MY PEOPLE BELIEVE.
THE GREAT SHEPHERD SENT ME TO EARTH TO HEAL HIS...
LAMB OR LION,
HIS WOUND MUST BE WASHED AND SEWN
OR IT WILL FESTER.
FOR 30 YEARS
I'VE BEEN MAKING CORPSES OUT OF MEN, BOY.
I'M THE MAN YOU WANT LEADING THE VANGUARD.
GALBART GLOVER WILL LEAD THE VAN.
THE BLOODY WALL WILL MELT
BEFORE AN UMBER MARCHES BEHIND A GLOVER.
I WILL LEAD THE VAN
OR I WILL TAKE MY MEN AND MARCH THEM HOME.
YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO SO, LORD UMBER.
AND WHEN I AM DONE WITH THE LANNISTERS,
I'LL MARCH BACK NORTH,
ROOT YOU OUT OF YOUR KEEP
AND HANG YOU FOR AN OATHBREAKER.
OATHBREAKER, IS IT?
!
I'LL NOT SIT HERE AND SWALLOW INSULTS
FROM A BOY SO GREEN HE PISSES GRASS.
MY LORD FATHER TAUGHT ME
IT WAS DEATH TO BARE STEEL AGAINST YOUR LIEGE LORD.
BUT DOUBTLESS THE GREATJON ONLY MEANT TO CUT MY MEAT FOR ME.
YOUR MEAT...
IS BLOODY TOUGH.
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
SOUTH.
FOR FATHER.
- BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
- THE LANNISTERS HAVE SPIES EVERYWHERE.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW WE'RE COMING.
THEY HAVE MORE MEN THAN WE DO.
AYE, THEY DO.
CAN'T I COME WITH YOU?
I CAN RIDE NOW.
YOU'VE SEEN ME RIDING.
AND I WON'T GET IN THE WAY, I...
THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A STARK AT WINTERFELL.
UNTIL I RETURN THAT WILL BE YOU.
YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE THE CASTLE WALLS WHILE WE ARE GONE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
LISTEN TO MAESTER LUWIN.
LOOK AFTER YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.
I WILL.
I'LL SEND LETTERS WHENEVER I CAN,
BUT IF YOU DON'T HEAR FROM ME,
DON'T BE SCARED.
UNTIL I RETURN.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING OUT THERE?
ROBB WILL BE LOOKING FOR YOU
TO SAY GOODBYE.
THEY'VE ALL GONE AWAY.
THEY'LL BE BACK SOON.
ROBB WILL FREE FATHER AND THEY'LL COME BACK WITH MOTHER.
NO, THEY WON'T.
PLEASE WATCH OVER ROBB.
AND WATCH OVER ALL THE OTHER MEN FROM WINTERFELL.
AND THEON TOO, I SUPPOSE.
YOU HEAR THEM, BOY?
THE OLD GODS ARE ANSWERING YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THEY'RE MY GODS TOO.
BEYOND THE WALL, THEY'RE THE ONLY GODS.
EVEN SLAVES ARE ALLOWED TO PRAY.
YOU'RE NOT A SLAVE.
WELL, YOUR FRIEND DID PUT A KNIFE TO MY THROAT.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, LITTLE LORD,
JUST TELLING TRUTHS.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN ABOUT HEARING THE GODS?
YOU ASKED THEM,
THEY'RE ANSWERING YOU.
OPEN YOUR EARS.
IT'S ONLY THE WIND.
WHO DO YOU THINK SENDS THE WIND IF NOT THE GODS?
THEY SEE YOU, BOY.
THEY HEAR YOU.
YOUR BROTHER WILL GET NO HELP FROM THEM WHERE HE'S GOING.
THE OLD GODS HAVE NO POWER IN THE SOUTH.
THE WEIRWOODS THERE WERE ALL CUT DOWN A LONG TIME AGO.
HOW CAN THEY WATCH WHEN THEY HAVE NO EYES?
WELL, THERE'S A BIG MAN.
HE HAS GIANTS' BLOOD IN HIM OR I'M THE QUEEN.
GO BACK AND FIND YOUR CLOTHES, HODOR.
GO DRESS.
HODOR.
ARE THERE REALLY GIANTS BEYOND THE WALL?
GIANTS AND WORSE THAN GIANTS.
I TRIED TELLING YOUR BROTHER, HE'S MARCHING THE WRONG WAY.
ALL THESE SWORDS, THEY SHOULD BE GOING NORTH, BOY.
NORTH, NOT SOUTH!
THE COLD WINDS ARE RISING.
THEY WERE TOUCHED BY WHITE WALKERS.
THAT'S WHY THEY CAME BACK.
THAT'S WHY THEIR EYES TURNED BLUE.
ONLY FIRE WILL STOP THEM.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
I READ ABOUT IT IN A BOOK...
A VERY OLD BOOK IN MAESTER AEMON'S LIBRARY.
WHAT ELSE DID THE BOOK SAY?
THE WHITE WALKERS
SLEEP BENEATH THE ICE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
AND WHEN THEY WAKE UP...
AND WHEN THEY WAKE UP, WHAT?
I HOPE THE WALL IS HIGH ENOUGH.
SUMMER SNOWS, MY LADY.
ROBB'S BROUGHT THE NORTH WITH HIM.
THE RIVER LORDS ARE FALLING BACK WITH JAIME LANNISTER AT THEIR HEELS.
AND LORD TYWIN IS BRINGING AROUND A SECOND LANNISTER ARMY FROM THE SOUTH.
OUR SCOUTS CONFIRM IT'S EVEN LARGER THAN THE KINGSLAYER'S.
ONE ARMY OR TWO,
THE KINGS IN THE NORTH THREW BACK HOSTS 10 TIMES AS LARGE.
YOU LOOK WELL.
YOU'RE A WELCOME SIGHT IN THESE TROUBLED TIMES.
WE HAD NOT THOUGHT TO MEET YOU HERE, MY LADY.
I HAD NOT THOUGHT TO BE HERE.
I WOULD SPEAK WITH MY SON ALONE.
I KNOW YOU WILL FORGIVE ME, MY LORDS.
YOU HEARD HER!
MOVE YOUR ASSES!
COME ON, OUT.
YOU TOO, GREYJOY.
ARE YOU BLOODY DEAF?
HAVE NO FEAR, MY LADY.
WE'LL SHOVE OUR SWORDS UP TYWIN LANNISTER'S BUNGHOLE
AND THEN IT'S ON TO THE RED KEEP TO FREE NED.
YOU OLD DEVIL, RODRIK.
YOU'RE NOT WASTING AWAY, ARE YOU?
I REMEMBER THE DAY YOU CAME INTO THIS WORLD
RED-FACED AND SQUALLING.
AND NOW I FIND YOU LEADING A HOST TO WAR.
- THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE.
- NO ONE?
WHO WERE THOSE MEN I SAW HERE?
- NONE OF THEM ARE STARKS.
- ALL OF THEM ARE SEASONED IN BATTLE.
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN SEND ME BACK TO WINTERFELL...
WOULD THAT I COULD.
THERE WAS...
A LETTER.
FROM SANSA.
FROM THE QUEEN, YOU MEAN.
THERE'S NO MENTION OF ARYA.
HOW MANY MEN DO YOU HAVE?
18,000.
IF I GO TO KING'S LANDING AND BEND MY KNEE TO JOFFREY...
YOU WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE.
OUR BEST HOPE, OUR ONLY HOPE...
IS THAT YOU CAN DEFEAT THEM IN THE FIELD.
AND IF I LOSE?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TARGARYEN CHILDREN
WHEN THE MAD KING FELL?
THEY WERE BUTCHERED IN THEIR SLEEP.
ON THE ORDERS OF TYWIN LANNISTER.
AND THE YEARS HAVE NOT MADE HIM KINDER.
IF YOU LOSE,
YOUR FATHER DIES,
YOUR SISTERS DIE,
WE DIE.
WELL, THAT MAKES IT SIMPLE THEN.
I SUPPOSE IT DOES.
FROM HERE IT MIGHT BE BEST IF BRONN AND I CONTINUE ALONE.
BEST FOR TYRION SON OF TYWIN.
NOT BEST FOR ME.
IF THE HALF MAN BETRAYS US,
SHAGGA SON OF DOLF WILL CUT OFF HIS MANHOOD...
AND FEED IT TO THE GOATS, YES.
ALL RIGHT THEN.
TIME TO MEET MY FATHER.
UNCLE.
FATHER.
THE RUMORS OF YOUR DEMISE WERE UNFOUNDED.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.
AND WHO ARE THESE COMPANIONS OF YOURS?
THIS IS SHAGGA SON OF DOLF,
CHIEFTAIN OF THE STONE CROWS.
TIMETT SON OF TIMETT, RULER OF THE BURNED MEN.
THIS FAIR MAID
IS CHELLA DAUGHTER OF CHEYK,
LEADER OF THE BLACK EARS.
AND HERE WE HAVE BRONN SON OF...
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HIM.
MAY I PRESENT MY LORD FATHER,
TYWIN SON OF TYTOS OF HOUSE LANNISTER,
LORD OF CASTERLY ROCK AND WARDEN OF THE WEST?
KIND OF YOU TO GO TO WAR FOR ME.
YOU LEFT US NO CHOICE.
THE HONOR OF THE HOUSE WAS AT STAKE.
YOUR BROTHER WOULD NEVER HAVE SUBMITTED TO CAPTURE SO MEEKLY.
WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES, JAIME AND I.
HE'S BRAVER.
I'M BETTER LOOKING.
HE'S BEEN COVERING HIMSELF IN GLORY.
JAIME SMASHED THE RIVER LORDS AT THE GOLDEN TOOTH,
AND NOW LAYS SIEGE TO RIVERRUN,
CATELYN STARK'S HOMELAND.
- AND THE STARKS?
LORD EDDARD?
- IS OUR HOSTAGE.
HE WILL LEAD NO ARMIES FROM HIS DUNGEON CELL.
HOW DID MY SWEET SISTER PERSUADE THE KING
TO IMPRISON HIS DEAR FRIEND NED?
ROBERT BARATHEON IS DEAD.
JOFFREY RULES IN KING'S LANDING.
MY SISTER RULES, YOU MEAN.
STARK'S SON HAS CALLED HIS BANNERS.
HE MOVES SOUTH WITH A STRONG HOST.
A GREEN BOY.
ONE TASTE OF BATTLE AND HE'LL RUN BACK TO WINTERFELL
WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS.
MAYBE.
THOUGH THE BOY DOES HAVE A CERTAIN BELLIGERENCE.
YOU'D LIKE HIM.
WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF WAR,
I MADE PROMISES TO MY FRIENDS HERE
AND A LANNISTER ALWAYS PAYS HIS DEBTS.
WE SHALL REQUIRE 3,000 HELMS AND SHIELDS,
PLUS SWORDS,
PIKES, GORGETS, MACES...
IF IT PLEASE MY LORD, SER ADDAM BIDS ME REPORT
THAT THE NORTHMEN HAVE CROSSED THE NECK.
THE WOLF RUSHES INTO THE LION'S JAWS.
SO BE IT.
KEVAN, COMMAND THE DRUMMERS BEAT ASSEMBLY.
AND SEND WORD TO JAIME THAT I AM MOVING AGAINST ROBB STARK.
AT ONCE, MY LORD.
THE MEN OF THE MOUNTAIN CLANS ARE GREAT WARRIORS.
RIDE WITH ME AGAINST MY ENEMIES
AND YOU SHALL HAVE ALL MY SON PROMISED YOU AND MORE.
ONLY IF THE HALF MAN FIGHTS WITH US.
UNTIL WE HOLD THE STEEL HE PLEDGED US,
THE LITTLE LION'S LIFE IS OURS.
THE SCOUTS REPORT LORD TYWIN MOVES NORTH.
WE NEED TO GET HIM ON BROKEN GROUND, PUT HIS KNIGHTS AT A DISADVANTAGE.
WE NEED TO GET AROUND HIM AND BREAK LANNISTER'S SIEGE OF RIVERRUN.
DO THAT AND THE RIVER LORDS WILL JOIN US.
TO DO EITHER WE NEED TO CROSS THE RIVER AND THE ONLY CROSSING IS AT THE TWINS.
LORD FREY CONTROLS THAT BRIDGE.
YOUR FATHER'S BANNERMAN.
"THE LATE LORD FREY" MY FATHER CALLS HIM.
AT THE TRIDENT, HE DIDN'T APPEAR
UNTIL THE BATTLE WAS DONE.
SOME MEN TAKES THEIR OATHS MORE SERIOUSLY THAN OTHERS.
ROBB'S RIGHT.
WE NEED THAT BRIDGE.
SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?
DO WE MOVE AGAINST JAIME
OR LORD TYWIN?
YOUR PARDON.
WE'VE CAPTURED A LANNISTER SCOUT.
DON'T WORRY, LAD.
HE WON'T BE LEAVING THIS TENT WITH HIS HEAD.
WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM?
IN THE BRUSH ABOVE THE ENCAMPMENT.
HE LOOKED TO BE COUNTING.
HOW HIGH DID YOU GET?
20,000.
MAYBE MORE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS YOURSELF.
YOUR FATHER WOULD UNDERSTAND...
MY FATHER UNRSTANDS MERCY, WHEN THERE IS ROOM FOR IT.
AND HE UNDERSTANDS HONOR...
AND COURAGE.
LET HIM GO.
TELL LORD TYWIN WINTER IS COMING FOR HIM.
20,000 NORTHERNERS MARCHING SOUTH TO FIND OUT IF HE REALLY DOES SHIT GOLD.
YES, MY LORD.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU TOUCHED, BOY?
LETTING HIM GO?
YOU CALL ME BOY AGAIN.
GO ON.
IT IS ALSO THE WISH OF HIS GRACE
THAT HIS LOYAL SERVANT JANOS SLYNT,
- COMMANDER OF THE CITY WATCH...
- SER ARON.
... BE AT ONCE RAISED TO THE RANK OF LORD...
AND GRANTED THE ANCIENT SEAT OF HARRENHAL,
AND THAT HIS SONS AND GRANDSONS SHALL HOLD THIS HONOR AFTER HIM
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.
IN PLACE OF THE TRAITOR EDDARD STARK, IT IS THE WISH OF HIS GRACE
THAT TYWIN LANNISTER, LORD OF CASTERLY ROCK
AND WARDEN OF THE WEST,
BE APPOINTED HAND OF THE KING.
LASTLY,
IN THESE TIMES OF TREASON AND TURMOIL,
IT IS THE VIEW OF THE COUNCIL
THAT THE LIFE AND SAFETY OF KING JOFFREY
BE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE.
SER BARRISTAN SELMY.
YOUR GRACE, I AM YOURS TO COMMAND.
RISE, SER BARRISTAN.
YOU MAY REMOVE YOUR HELM.
YOU HAVE SERVED THE REALM LONG AND FAITHFULLY.
EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS OWES YOU THANKS.
BUT IT IS TIME TO PUT ASIDE YOUR ARMOR AND YOUR SWORD.
IT IS TIME TO REST AND LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE
ON YOUR MANY YEARS OF SERVICE.
THE KINGSGUARD IS A SWORN BROTHERHOOD.
OUR VOWS ARE TAKEN FOR LIFE.
ONLY DEATH RELIEVES US OF OUR SACRED TRUST.
WHOSE DEATH, SER BARRISTAN?
YOURS OR YOUR KING'S?
YOU LET MY FATHER DIE.
YOU'RE TOO OLD TO PROTECT ANYBODY.
THE COUNCIL HAS DETERMINED
THAT SER JAIME LANNISTER WILL TAKE YOUR PLACE
AS LORD COMMANDER OF THE KINGSGUARD.
HE WHO PROFANED HIS BLADE WITH THE BLOOD OF THE KING HE HAD SWORN TO DEFEND!
CAREFUL, SER.
WE HAVE NOTHING BUT GRATITUDE FOR YOUR LONG SERVICE, GOOD SER.
YOU SHALL BE GIVEN A STOUT KEEP BESIDE THE SEA,
WITH SERVANTS TO LOOK AFTER YOUR EVERY NEED.
A HOLE TO DIE IN
AND MEN TO BURY ME.
I AM A KNIGHT.
I SHALL DIE A KNIGHT.
A NAKED KNIGHT, APPARENTLY.
EVEN NOW I COULD CUT THROUGH THE FIVE OF YOU LIKE CARVING A CAKE!
HERE, BOY!
MELT IT DOWN AND ADD IT TO THE OTHERS.
IF ANY MAN IN THIS HALL HAS OTHER MATTERS
TO SET BEFORE HIS GRACE, LET HIM SPEAK NOW
OR GO FORTH AND HOLD HIS SILENCE.
YOUR GRACE.
COME FORWARD, MY LADY.
THE LADY SANSA OF HOUSE STARK.
DO YOU HAVE SOME BUSINESS FOR THE KING AND THE COUNCIL?
I DO.
AS IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE, I ASK MERCY FOR MY FATHER,
LORD EDDARD STARK, WHO WAS HAND OF THE KING.
TREASON IS A NOXIOUS WEED.
- IT SHOULD BE TORN OUT, ROOT...
- LET HER SPEAK.
I WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS.
DO YOU DENY YOUR FATHER'S CRIME?
NO, MY LORDS.
I KNOW HE MUST BE PUNISHED.
ALL I ASK IS MERCY.
I KNOW MY LORD FATHER MUST REGRET WHAT HE DID.
HE WAS KING ROBERT'S FRIEND AND HE LOVED HIM, YOU ALL KNOW IT.
HE NEVER WANTED TO BE HAND UNTIL THE KING ASKED HIM.
THEY MUST HAVE LIED TO HIM...
LORD RENLY OR LORD STANNIS,
THEY MUST HAVE LIED!
HE SAID I WASN'T THE KING.
WHY DID HE SAY THAT?
HE WAS BADLY HURT.
MAESTER PYCELLE WAS GIVING HIM MILK OF THE POPPY.
HE WASN'T HIMSELF.
OTHERWISE HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SAID IT.
A CHILD'S FAITH...
SUCH SWEET INNOCENCE.
AND YET THEY SAY WISDOM OFT COMES FROM THE MOUTHS OF BABES.
TREASON...
IS TREASON!
ANYTHING ELSE?
IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY AFFECTION IN YOUR HEART FOR ME,
PLEASE DO ME THIS KINDNESS, YOUR GRACE.
YOUR SWEET WORDS HAVE MOVED ME.
BUT YOUR FATHER HAS TO CONFESS.
HE HAS TO CONFESS AND SAY THAT I'M THE KING...
OR THERE'LL BE NO MERCY FOR HIM.
HE WILL.

( Wooden swords clacking )
Yah!
Left high, left low.
( Swords clanging )
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
- What is-- - ( Screaming )
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- ( Swords clanging )
- Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
Man:
This way!
( Reaming )
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you-- watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
( Door opens )
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
( Laughs ) Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
- Bloody oafs.
- ( Sword rings )
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
( Wood clatters )
What do we say to the God of death?
Not today.
Go.
( Lannister men moaning )
- ( Swords ringing ) - ( Men screaming )
Not today.
Not today.
( Gasps )
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll-
- I'll tell the Queen.
( Chuckles ) Who do you think sent me?
( Horses neigh )
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me-- the Queen!
- Stay away!
- ( Gasps )
( Door clanging, creaking )
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though-- all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
( Door creaks, clangs )
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
( Sniffs )
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers-- a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
Pycelle:
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
( Huffs )
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that-- what will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On-- on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
( Cawing )
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son--
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
( Whistling a tune )
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
( Whistles )
- ( Rustling ) - ( Bronn whispers ) Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
( Birds chirp, flutter )
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
( Laughing )
( All laughing )
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My-- my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight-- not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
( Barking, whining )
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
( Whining growls )
( Snarling )
( Growling )
Commander?
( Barks, whines )
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
( Whines )
- Lord Commander?
- ( Door slams )
( Barking )
( Growling )
Mormont:
Snow?
Commander!
( Yelps )
Move move!
( Snarling, screaming )
( Grunts )
( Screaming, snarling continue )
What did they do?
( Rakharo speaking Dothraki )
Daenerys:
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
( Louder screaming )
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
( Rakharo speaking )
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
( Rakharo speaks )
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Man:
Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
( Speaks Dothraki )
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Man:
Me Fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Drogo:
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
( Drogo snickers )
( Spits )
( Drogo grunts ) Ohos.
Os.
( Gasps )
( Woman speaking Dothraki )
( Gasps )
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
( Spits )
My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his--
lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
( Men chatting, eating )
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
( Snarls )
( Screaming )
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel
- against your Liege Lord.
- ( Huffs )
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
( Chortles )
( All laughing )
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I--
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Bran:
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
( Leaves rustling )
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
( Sighs )
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
( Running footsteps )
( Osha giggles ) Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- ( Laughs )
- Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
( Leaves rustling )
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book-- a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up--
And when they wake up, what?
I hope The Wall is high enough.
( Men chattering )
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey-- you would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope-- our only hope-- is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood-- and feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these...
Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
--Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces-- if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
Rodrik:
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Theon:
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
( Grunting )
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't b leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand--
My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
( Softly ) Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
( Growls )
Oi.
Pycelle:
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- ...
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
( Lords mutter )
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
( Murmuring )
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
Joffrey:
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight.
I shall die a Knight.
A naked Knight, apparently.
( Laughter )
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
( Doors creak, clang )
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
Steward:
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise h never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
( Music playing )
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
(Wooden swords clacking)
Yah!
Left high, left low.
(Swords clanging, men shouting)
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
- What is...
- (Screaming)
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- Hush!
- (Swords clanging, men yelling)
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
- (Man) This way!
- (Door banging)
(Screaming)
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.
I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
(Door opens)
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
(Laughs) Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
- (Wood clatters)
- What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
(Men moaning)
(Swords ringing) (Men screaming)
Not today.
Not today.
(Gasps)
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the queen.
(Chuckles) Who do you think sent me?
(Horses neighing)
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
- Stay away!
- (Gasps)
(Door clanging, creaking)
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
(Door creaks, clangs)
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
(Sniffs) What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
(Varys) Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
(Pycelle) A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
(Sighs)
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
(Cawing)
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
(Tyrion whistling a tune)
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price,
I'll beat it.
I like living.
(Whistles)
- (Rustling) - (Bronn whispers) Tyrion.
Tyrion.
(Birds chirp, flutter)
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
(Laughing)
(All laughing)
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
(Crow cawing)
(Ser Alliser) Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
(Barking, whining)
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is someone out there?
(Whining and growling)
(Snarling)
(Growling)
Commander?
(Barks, whines)
Stay.
Hello?
- Who's there?
- (Whines)
- Lord Commander?
- (Door slams)
(Barking)
(Growling)
(Mormont) Snow?
Commander!
(Yelps)
(Screaming)
Move!
(Men yelling, women screaming)
(Grunts)
(Screaming and yelling continue)
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
(Daenerys) I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
(Women screaming)
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khai.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
(Rakharo speaks Dothraki)
- Come.
- (Man speaks Dothraki)
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
(Man speaks Dothraki)
(Dothraki continues)
(Drogo speaks Dothraki)
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
(Drogo snickers)
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
(Speaks Dothraki)
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
(Speaks English) Thank you, silver lady.
(Speaks English) Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
(Men chatting)
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters,
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
(Snarls)
(Screaming)
(Snap) (Screams)
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
(Jon Umber chortles)
(All laughing)
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
(Bran) Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
- Open your ears.
- (Leaves rustling)
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you. (Sighs)
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
(Running footsteps)
(Osha giggles) Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- (Laughs)
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
- The cold winds are rising.
- (Leaves rustling)
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
(Men chattering in camp)
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
(Rodrik) The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
(Grunting)
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
(Growls)
Oi.
(Pycelle) It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
...and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
(Lords mutter)
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride
- on your many years of service.
- (Murmuring)
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
(Joffrey) You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
(Laughter)
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
(Doors creak, clang)
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
(Steward) The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.

Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
What is--
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you-- watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the God of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll-
- I'll tell the Queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
She'll reward me-- the Queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though-- all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers-- a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that-- what will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On-- on what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yeah.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son--
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No no no no no!
My-- my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight-- not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move move!
What did they do?
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!
- Come.
- Man:
Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Me Fati!
Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Me vastoe hatif anni;
ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
Ohos.
Os.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his--
lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters
I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For father.
But it's the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I--
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book-- a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up--
And when they wake up, what?
I hope The Wall is high enough.
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey-- you would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope-- our only hope-- is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood-- and feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these...
Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
--Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces-- if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't b leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand--
My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
- Lord Gyles.
- ...
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight.
I shall die a Knight.
A naked Knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise h never would have said it.
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...
Or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.

LEFT HIGH, LEFT LOW.
RIGHT LOW,
LUNGE RIGHT.
YOU BREAK ANYTHING, THE SEPTA WILL HAVE MY HEAD.
YOUR SISTER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WE WERE TO LEAVE TODAY.
- HOW SHE COULD FORGET...
- SHE DIDN'T FORGET.
SHE'S WITH HER DANCING MASTER.
SHE'S WITH HIM EVERY MORNING.
SHE ALWAYS COMES BACK WITH SCRAPES AND BRUISES.
SHE'S SO CLUMSY.
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM.
BAR THE DOORS
AND DO NOT OPEN THEM FOR ANYONE YOU DO NOT KNOW.
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- DO AS I TOLD YOU.
RUN!
LEFT, RIGHT.
NOW YOU ARE DEAD.
YOU SAID RIGHT,
- BUT YOU WENT LEFT.
- AND NOW YOU ARE A DEAD GIRL.
ONLY 'CAUSE YOU LIED.
MY TONGUE LIED.
MY EYES SHOUTED THE TRUTH.
- YOU WERE NOT SEEING.
- I WAS SO.
- I WATCHED, BUT YOU...
- WATCHING IS NOT SEEING, DEAD GIRL.
THE SEEING,
THE TRUE SEEING,
THAT IS THE HEART OF SWORDPLAY.
ARYA STARK,
COME WITH US.
YOUR FATHER WANTS TO SEE YOU.
AND WHY IS IT THAT LORD EDDARD
IS SENDING LANNISTER MEN IN PLACE OF HIS OWN?
I AM WONDERING.
MIND YOUR PLACE, DANCING MASTER.
- THIS IS NO CONCERN OF YOURS.
- MY FATHER WOULDN'T SEND YOU.
AND I DON'T HAVE TO GO WITH YOU IF I DON'T WANT.
- TAKE HER.
- ARE YOU MEN OR SNAKES,
THAT YOU WOULD THREATEN A CHILD?
GET OUT OF MY WAY, LITTLE MAN.
I AM SYRIO FOREL...
FOREIGN BASTARD.
AND YOU WILL BE SPEAKING TO ME WITH MORE RESPECT.
KILL THE BRAAVOSI.
BRING THE GIRL.
ARYA CHILD, WE ARE DONE WITH DANCING FOR THE DAY.
RUN TO YOUR FATHER.
BLOODY OAFS.
BE GONE NOW, ARYA.
COME WITH ME.
RUN.
THE FIRST SWORD OF BRAAVOS DOES NOT RUN.
WHAT DO WE SAY TO THE GOD OF DEATH?
NOT TODAY.
GO.
NOT TODAY.
NOT TODAY.
STAY AWAY FROM ME.
I'LL TELL MY FATHER.
I'LL TELL THE QUEEN.
WHO DO YOU THINK SENT ME?
NEEDLE.
THERE SHE IS.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I WANT YOU, WOLF GIRL.
- COME HERE.
- LEAVE ME BE.
- MY FATHER'S A LORD.
HE'LL REWARD YOU.
- SHE'LL REWARD ME...
THE QUEEN!
STAY AWAY!
LORD STARK,
YOU MUST BE THIRSTY.
I PROMISE YOU IT ISN'T POISONED.
WHY IS IT NO ONE EVER TRUSTS THE EUNUCH?
NOT SO MUCH, MY LORD.
I WOULD SAVE THE REST, IF I WERE YOU.
HIDE IT.
MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DIE OF THIRST IN THESE CELLS.
WHAT ABOUT MY DAUGHTERS?
THE YOUNGER ONE SEEMS TO HAVE ESCAPED THE CASTLE.
EVEN MY LITTLE BIRDS CANNOT FIND HER.
- AND SANSA?
- STILL ENGAGED TO JOFFREY.
CERSEI WILL KEEP HER CLOSE.
THE REST OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD THOUGH...
ALL DEAD, IT GRIEVES ME TO SAY.
I DO SO HATE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.
YOU WATCHED MY MEN BEING SLAUGHTERED AND DID NOTHING.
AND WOULD AGAIN, MY LORD.
I WAS UNARMED, UNARMORED AND SURROUNDED BY LANNISTER SWORDS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME DO YOU SEE A HERO?
WHAT MADNESS LED YOU TO TELL THE QUEEN
YOU HAD LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT JOFFREY'S BIRTH?
THE MADNESS OF MERCY.
- THAT SHE MIGHT SAVE HER CHILDREN.
- THE CHILDREN.
IT IS ALWAYS THE INNOCENTS WHO SUFFER.
IT WASN'T THE WINE THAT KILLED ROBERT, NOR THE BOAR.
THE WINE SLOWED HIM DOWN AND THE BOAR RIPPED HIM OPEN,
BUT IT WAS YOUR MERCY THAT KILLED THE KING.
I TRUST YOU KNOW YOU ARE A DEAD MAN, LORD EDDARD?
THE QUEEN CAN'T KILL ME.
CAT HOLDS HER BROTHER.
THE WRONG BROTHER SADLY.
AND LOST TO HER.
YOUR WIFE HAS LET THE IMP SLIP THROUGH HER FINGERS.
IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN SLIT MY THROAT AND BE DONE WITH IT.
NOT TODAY, MY LORD.
TELL ME SOMETHING, VARYS.
WHO DO YOU TRULY SERVE?
THE REALM, MY LORD.
SOMEONE MUST.
IT'S OTHOR,
WITHOUT A DOUBT.
THE OTHER ONE IS JAFER FLOWERS,
LESS THE HAND THE WOLF TORE OFF.
ANY SIGN OF BENJEN
OR THE REST OF HIS PARTY?
JUST THESE TWO, MY LORD.
BEEN DEAD AWHILE, I'D SAY.
THE SMELL.
WHAT SMELL?
THERE IS NONE.
IF THEY'D BE DEAD FOR A LONG TIME, WOULDN'T THERE BE ROT?
- WE SHOULD BURN THEM.
- SNOW'S NOT WRONG, MY LORD.
FIRE WILL DO FOR THEM.
THE WILDLING WAY.
I WANT MAESTER AEMON TO EXAMINE THEM FIRST.
YOU MAY BE A COWARD, TARLY, BUT YOU'RE NOT STUPID.
GET THEM INSIDE.
YOU HEARD HIM.
LORD COMMANDER,
MAESTER AEMON AWAITS YOU IN HIS CHAMBERS...
A RAVEN FROM KING'S LANDING.
COME ON, MOVE 'EM OUT.
BRING ME A HORN OF ALE, SNOW,
AND POUR ONE FOR YOURSELF.
THE KING IS DEAD.
IS THERE ANY WORD OF MY FATHER?
SIT.
LORD STARK HAS BEEN
CHARGED WITH TREASON.
THEY SAY HE CONSPIRED WITH ROBERT'S BROTHERS
TO DENY THE THRONE TO PRINCE JOFFREY.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF DOING ANYTHING STUPID.
YOUR DUTY LIES HERE NOW.
MY SISTERS WERE IN KING'S LANDING TOO.
I'M SURE THEY'LL BE
TREATED GENTLY.
YOUR FATHER HAS PROVED TO BE AN AWFUL TRAITOR, DEAR.
KING ROBERT'S BODY WAS STILL WARM
WHEN LORD EDDARD BEGAN PLOTTING TO STEAL JOFFREY'S RIGHTFUL THRONE.
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HE KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE JOFFREY.
HE WOULDN'T.
PLEASE, YOUR GRACE, THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
SEND FOR MY FATHER.
HE'LL TELL YOU...
THE KING WAS HIS FRIEND.
SANSA SWEETLING, YOU ARE INNOCENT OF ANY WRONG.
WE KNOW THAT.
YET YOU ARE THE DAUGHTER OF A TRAITOR.
HOW CAN I ALLOW YOU TO MARRY MY SON?
A CHILD BORN OF A TRAITOR'S SEED
IS NO FIT CONSORT FOR OUR KING.
SHE IS A SWEET THING NOW, YOUR GRACE,
BUT IN 10 YEARS, WHO KNOWS WHAT TREASONS SHE MAY HATCH?
NO, I'M NOT.
I'LL BE A GOOD WIFE TO HIM, YOU'LL SEE.
I'LL BE A QUEEN JUST LIKE YOU, I PROMISE.
I WON'T HATCH ANYTHING.
THE GIRL IS INNOCENT, YOUR GRACE.
SHE SHOULD BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO PROVE HER LOYALTY.
LITTLE DOVE,
YOU MUST WRITE TO LADY CATELYN
AND YOUR BROTHER, THE ELDEST, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
ROBB.
WORD OF YOUR FATHER'S ARREST WILL REACH HIM SOON, NO DOUBT.
BEST IT COMES FROM YOU.
IF YOU WOULD HELP YOUR FATHER, URGE YOUR BROTHER TO KEEP THE KING'S PEACE.
TELL HIM TO COME TO KING'S LANDING AND SWEAR HIS FEALTY TO JOFFREY.
IF I COULD SEE MY FATHER, TALK TO HIM ABOUT...
YOU DISAPPOINT ME, CHILD.
WE HAVE TOLD YOU OF YOUR FATHER'S TREASON.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO A TRAITOR?
I ONLY MEANT THAT...
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIM?
THAT DEPENDS.
ON...
- ON WHAT?
- ON YOUR BROTHER.
AND ON YOU.
TREASON?
SANSA WROTE THIS?
IT IS YOUR SISTER'S HAND, BUT THE QUEEN'S WORDS.
YOU ARE SUMMONED TO KING'S LANDING TO SWEAR FEALTY TO THE NEW KING.
JOFFREY PUTS MY FATHER IN CHAINS, NOW HE WANTS HIS ASS KISSED?
THIS IS A ROYAL COMMAND, MY LORD.
- IF YOU SHOULD REFUSE TO OBEY...
- I WON'T REFUSE.
HIS GRACE SUMMONS ME TO KING'S LANDING, I'LL GO TO KING'S LANDING.
BUT NOT ALONE.
CALL THE BANNERS.
ALL OF THEM, MY LORD?
THEY'VE ALL SWORN TO DEFEND MY FATHER?
THEY HAVE.
NOW WE SEE WHAT THEIR WORDS ARE WORTH.
ARE YOU AFRAID?
I MUST BE.
GOOD.
WHY IS THAT GOOD?
IT MEANS YOU'RE NOT STUPID.
YOU'VE HAD THIS SINCE DAWN?
HE SENT IT TO ME, NOT YOU.
- I'VE SHOWN IT TO YOU AS A COURTESY.
- A COURTESY?
!
MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN TAKEN PRISONER.
MY SON INTENDS TO DECLARE WAR.
A WAR?
YOUR SON AGAINST THE LANNISTERS?
YOU SHOULD GO TO HIM.
TEACH HIM PATIENCE.
NED ROTS IN A DUNGEON AND YOU SPEAK OF PATIENCE?
HE IS YOUR BROTHER BY LAW!
DOES FAMILY MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?
FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.
AND I WILL NOT RISK ROBIN'S LIFE
TO GET CAUGHT UP IN ANOTHER OF YOUR HUSBAND'S WARS.
I'M HUNGRY.
HUSH NOW, DARLING.
YOU JUST ATE.
YOU WILL NOT SUPPORT US THEN?
DO I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY?
- BUT I'M HUNGRY!
- SOON, LOVE, SOON.
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME HERE, SISTER.
BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SEND MEN FROM THE VALE TO FIGHT...
THAT IS WHAT I ASK.
GO ON, SWEET.
TIME FOR YOUR BATH.
I'LL FEED YOU AFTER.
IF YOU FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR SON...
OF COURSE I FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF MY SON!
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?
THEY KILLED MY HUSBAND.
YOU SAY THEY SHOVED YOUR BOY FROM A WINDOW.
THESE PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING.
AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO STOP THEM.
THE KNIGHTS OF THE VALE WILL STAY IN THE VALE
WHERE THEY BELONG,
TO PROTECT THEIR LORD.
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
THERE'S HILL TRIBES ALL AROUND HERE.
IF I'M GOING TO DIE, IT MAYS AS WELL BE WITH A SONG IN MY HEART.
I SHOULD JUST TAKE YOUR FOOD AND LEAVE YOU HERE.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN?
STARVE, MOST LIKELY.
YOU DON'T THINK I'D DO IT, DO YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BRONN?
GOLD?
WOMEN?
GOLDEN WOMEN?
STICK WITH ME AND YOU'LL HAVE THEM ALL,
FOR AS LONG AS I'M AROUND AND NOT FOR A MOMENT LONGER.
BUT YOU KNEW THAT.
THAT IS WHY YOU SO VALIANTLY TOOK UP ARMS TO DEFEND MY HONOR.
FAIR ENOUGH.
BUT DON'T GO LOOKING FOR ME TO BEND THE KNEE
AND "MY LORD" YOU EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A SHIT.
I'M NOT YOUR TOADY AND I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.
THOUGH I WOULD TREASURE YOUR FRIENDSHIP,
I'M MAINLY INTERESTED IN YOUR FACILITY WITH MURDER.
AND IF THE DAY EVER COMES WHEN YOU'RE TEMPTED TO SELL ME OUT,
REMEMBER THIS:
WHATEVER THEIR PRICE,
I'LL BEAT IT.
I LIKE LIVING.
COME, SHARE OUR FIRE.
HELP YOURSELVES TO OUR GOAT.
WHEN YOU MEET YOUR GODS, YOU TELL THEM
SHAGGA SON OF DOLF
OF THE STONE CROWS SENT YOU.
I AM TYRION SON OF TYWIN OF CLAN LANNISTER.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO DIE, TYRION SON OF TYWIN?
IN MY OWN BED, AT THE AGE OF 80
WITH A BELLY FULL OF WINE AND A GIRL'S MOUTH AROUND MY COCK.
TAKE THE HALF MAN.
HE CAN DANCE FOR THE CHILDREN.
KILL THE OTHER ONE.
MY HOUSE IS RICH AND POWERFUL.
IF YOU SEE US THROUGH THESE MOUNTAINS,
MY FATHER WILL SHOWER YOU WITH GOLD.
WE HAVE NO USE FOR A HALF MAN'S PROMISES.
HALF A MAN MAYBE, BUT AT LEAST I HAVE THE COURAGE TO FACE MY ENEMIES.
WHAT DO THE STONE CROWS DO?
HIDE BEHIND ROCKS
AND SHIVER WHEN THE KNIGHTS OF THE VALE RIDE BY?
ARE THOSE THE BEST WEAPONS YOU COULD STEAL?
GOOD ENOUGH FOR KILLING SHEEP, IF THE SHEEP DON'T FIGHT BACK.
LANNISTER SMITHS SHIT BETTER STEEL.
YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN US OVER WITH YOUR TRINKETS?
THAT TRINKET IS WORTH MORE THAN EVERYTHING YOUR TRIBE OWNS.
BUT IF YOU HELP US, SHAGGA SON OF DOLF,
I WILL NOT GIVE YOU TRINKETS.
I WILL GIVE YOU THIS.
WHAT IS "THIS"?
THE VALE OF ARRYN.
THE LORDS OF THE VALE HAVE ALWAYS SPAT UPON THE HILL TRIBES.
THE LORDS OF THE VALE WANT ME DEAD.
I BELIEVE IT IS TIME FOR NEW LORDS OF THE VALE.
NOW THERE'S A RARE SIGHT...
NOT ONLY A BASTARD, BUT A TRAITOR'S BASTARD.
STOP, PUT IT DOWN!
BLOOD WILL ALWAYS TELL.
YOU'LL HANG FOR THIS, BASTARD.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO ANYTHING STUPID.
YOU'RE CONFINED TO QUARTERS.
GO.
GHOST, WHAT'S WRONG?
IS SOMETHING OUT THERE?
COMMANDER?
STAY.
HELLO?
WHO'S THERE?
LORD COMMANDER?
MOVE!
WHAT DID THEY DO?
I THOUGHT THE DOTHRAKI DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MONEY.
GOLD TO HIRE SHIPS, PRINCESS,
SHIPS TO SAIL TO WESTEROS.
JORAH, MAKE THEM STOP.
YOU HEARD ME.
THESE MEN HAVE SHED BLOOD FOR THEIR KHAL.
NOW THEY CLAIM THEIR REWARDS.
YOU HAVE A GENTLE HEART, BUT THIS IS HOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.
I DO NOT HAVE A GENTLE HEART, SER.
COME.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT DONE WITH THEM?
- BRING HER TO ME.
AND THOSE WOMEN THERE.
YOU CANNOT CLAIM THEM ALL, PRINCESS.
I CAN,
AND I WILL.
THANK YOU, SILVER LADY.
WHO ARE YOU?
I AM NAMED MIRRI MAZ DUUR.
I WAS THE GODSWIFE OF THIS TEMPLE.
MY MOTHER WAS GODSWIFE HERE BEFORE ME.
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE HEALING SMOKES AND OINTMENTS.
ALL MEN ARE OF ONE FLOCK, SO MY PEOPLE BELIEVE.
THE GREAT SHEPHERD SENT ME TO EARTH TO HEAL HIS...
LAMB OR LION,
HIS WOUND MUST BE WASHED AND SEWN
OR IT WILL FESTER.
FOR 30 YEARS
I'VE BEEN MAKING CORPSES OUT OF MEN, BOY.
I'M THE MAN YOU WANT LEADING THE VANGUARD.
GALBART GLOVER WILL LEAD THE VAN.
THE BLOODY WALL WILL MELT
BEFORE AN UMBER MARCHES BEHIND A GLOVER.
I WILL LEAD THE VAN
OR I WILL TAKE MY MEN AND MARCH THEM HOME.
YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO SO, LORD UMBER.
AND WHEN I AM DONE WITH THE LANNISTERS,
I'LL MARCH BACK NORTH,
ROOT YOU OUT OF YOUR KEEP
AND HANG YOU FOR AN OATHBREAKER.
OATHBREAKER, IS IT?
!
I'LL NOT SIT HERE AND SWALLOW INSULTS
FROM A BOY SO GREEN HE PISSES GRASS.
MY LORD FATHER TAUGHT ME
IT WAS DEATH TO BARE STEEL AGAINST YOUR LIEGE LORD.
BUT DOUBTLESS THE GREATJON ONLY MEANT TO CUT MY MEAT FOR ME.
YOUR MEAT...
IS BLOODY TOUGH.
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
SOUTH.
FOR FATHER.
- BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
- THE LANNISTERS HAVE SPIES EVERYWHERE.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW WE'RE COMING.
THEY HAVE MORE MEN THAN WE DO.
AYE, THEY DO.
CAN'T I COME WITH YOU?
I CAN RIDE NOW.
YOU'VE SEEN ME RIDING.
AND I WON'T GET IN THE WAY, I...
THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A STARK AT WINTERFELL.
UNTIL I RETURN THAT WILL BE YOU.
YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE THE CASTLE WALLS WHILE WE ARE GONE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
LISTEN TO MAESTER LUWIN.
LOOK AFTER YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.
I WILL.
I'LL SEND LETTERS WHENEVER I CAN,
BUT IF YOU DON'T HEAR FROM ME,
DON'T BE SCARED.
UNTIL I RETURN.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING OUT THERE?
ROBB WILL BE LOOKING FOR YOU
TO SAY GOODBYE.
THEY'VE ALL GONE AWAY.
THEY'LL BE BACK SOON.
ROBB WILL FREE FATHER AND THEY'LL COME BACK WITH MOTHER.
NO, THEY WON'T.
PLEASE WATCH OVER ROBB.
AND WATCH OVER ALL THE OTHER MEN FROM WINTERFELL.
AND THEON TOO, I SUPPOSE.
YOU HEAR THEM, BOY?
THE OLD GODS ARE ANSWERING YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THEY'RE MY GODS TOO.
BEYOND THE WALL, THEY'RE THE ONLY GODS.
EVEN SLAVES ARE ALLOWED TO PRAY.
YOU'RE NOT A SLAVE.
WELL, YOUR FRIEND DID PUT A KNIFE TO MY THROAT.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, LITTLE LORD,
JUST TELLING TRUTHS.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN ABOUT HEARING THE GODS?
YOU ASKED THEM,
THEY'RE ANSWERING YOU.
OPEN YOUR EARS.
IT'S ONLY THE WIND.
WHO DO YOU THINK SENDS THE WIND IF NOT THE GODS?
THEY SEE YOU, BOY.
THEY HEAR YOU.
YOUR BROTHER WILL GET NO HELP FROM THEM WHERE HE'S GOING.
THE OLD GODS HAVE NO POWER IN THE SOUTH.
THE WEIRWOODS THERE WERE ALL CUT DOWN A LONG TIME AGO.
HOW CAN THEY WATCH WHEN THEY HAVE NO EYES?
WELL, THERE'S A BIG MAN.
HE HAS GIANTS' BLOOD IN HIM OR I'M THE QUEEN.
GO BACK AND FIND YOUR CLOTHES, HODOR.
GO DRESS.
HODOR.
ARE THERE REALLY GIANTS BEYOND THE WALL?
GIANTS AND WORSE THAN GIANTS.
I TRIED TELLING YOUR BROTHER, HE'S MARCHING THE WRONG WAY.
ALL THESE SWORDS, THEY SHOULD BE GOING NORTH, BOY.
NORTH, NOT SOUTH!
THE COLD WINDS ARE RISING.
THEY WERE TOUCHED BY WHITE WALKERS.
THAT'S WHY THEY CAME BACK.
THAT'S WHY THEIR EYES TURNED BLUE.
ONLY FIRE WILL STOP THEM.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
I READ ABOUT IT IN A BOOK...
A VERY OLD BOOK IN MAESTER AEMON'S LIBRARY.
WHAT ELSE DID THE BOOK SAY?
THE WHITE WALKERS
SLEEP BENEATH THE ICE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
AND WHEN THEY WAKE UP...
AND WHEN THEY WAKE UP, WHAT?
I HOPE THE WALL IS HIGH ENOUGH.
SUMMER SNOWS, MY LADY.
ROBB'S BROUGHT THE NORTH WITH HIM.
THE RIVER LORDS ARE FALLING BACK WITH JAIME LANNISTER AT THEIR HEELS.
AND LORD TYWIN IS BRINGING AROUND A SECOND LANNISTER ARMY FROM THE SOUTH.
OUR SCOUTS CONFIRM IT'S EVEN LARGER THAN THE KINGSLAYER'S.
ONE ARMY OR TWO,
THE KINGS IN THE NORTH THREW BACK HOSTS 10 TIMES AS LARGE.
YOU LOOK WELL.
YOU'RE A WELCOME SIGHT IN THESE TROUBLED TIMES.
WE HAD NOT THOUGHT TO MEET YOU HERE, MY LADY.
I HAD NOT THOUGHT TO BE HERE.
I WOULD SPEAK WITH MY SON ALONE.
I KNOW YOU WILL FORGIVE ME, MY LORDS.
YOU HEARD HER!
MOVE YOUR ASSES!
COME ON, OUT.
YOU TOO, GREYJOY.
ARE YOU BLOODY DEAF?
HAVE NO FEAR, MY LADY.
WE'LL SHOVE OUR SWORDS UP TYWIN LANNISTER'S BUNGHOLE
AND THEN IT'S ON TO THE RED KEEP TO FREE NED.
YOU OLD DEVIL, RODRIK.
YOU'RE NOT WASTING AWAY, ARE YOU?
I REMEMBER THE DAY YOU CAME INTO THIS WORLD
RED-FACED AND SQUALLING.
AND NOW I FIND YOU LEADING A HOST TO WAR.
- THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE.
- NO ONE?
WHO WERE THOSE MEN I SAW HERE?
- NONE OF THEM ARE STARKS.
- ALL OF THEM ARE SEASONED IN BATTLE.
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN SEND ME BACK TO WINTERFELL...
WOULD THAT I COULD.
THERE WAS...
A LETTER.
FROM SANSA.
FROM THE QUEEN, YOU MEAN.
THERE'S NO MENTION OF ARYA.
HOW MANY MEN DO YOU HAVE?
18,000.
IF I GO TO KING'S LANDING AND BEND MY KNEE TO JOFFREY...
YOU WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE.
OUR BEST HOPE, OUR ONLY HOPE...
IS THAT YOU CAN DEFEAT THEM IN THE FIELD.
AND IF I LOSE?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TARGARYEN CHILDREN
WHEN THE MAD KING FELL?
THEY WERE BUTCHERED IN THEIR SLEEP.
ON THE ORDERS OF TYWIN LANNISTER.
AND THE YEARS HAVE NOT MADE HIM KINDER.
IF YOU LOSE,
YOUR FATHER DIES,
YOUR SISTERS DIE,
WE DIE.
WELL, THAT MAKES IT SIMPLE THEN.
I SUPPOSE IT DOES.
FROM HERE IT MIGHT BE BEST IF BRONN AND I CONTINUE ALONE.
BEST FOR TYRION SON OF TYWIN.
NOT BEST FOR ME.
IF THE HALF MAN BETRAYS US,
SHAGGA SON OF DOLF WILL CUT OFF HIS MANHOOD...
AND FEED IT TO THE GOATS, YES.
ALL RIGHT THEN.
TIME TO MEET MY FATHER.
UNCLE.
FATHER.
THE RUMORS OF YOUR DEMISE WERE UNFOUNDED.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.
AND WHO ARE THESE COMPANIONS OF YOURS?
THIS IS SHAGGA SON OF DOLF,
CHIEFTAIN OF THE STONE CROWS.
TIMETT SON OF TIMETT, RULER OF THE BURNED MEN.
THIS FAIR MAID
IS CHELLA DAUGHTER OF CHEYK,
LEADER OF THE BLACK EARS.
AND HERE WE HAVE BRONN SON OF...
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HIM.
MAY I PRESENT MY LORD FATHER,
TYWIN SON OF TYTOS OF HOUSE LANNISTER,
LORD OF CASTERLY ROCK AND WARDEN OF THE WEST?
KIND OF YOU TO GO TO WAR FOR ME.
YOU LEFT US NO CHOICE.
THE HONOR OF THE HOUSE WAS AT STAKE.
YOUR BROTHER WOULD NEVER HAVE SUBMITTED TO CAPTURE SO MEEKLY.
WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES, JAIME AND I.
HE'S BRAVER.
I'M BETTER LOOKING.
HE'S BEEN COVERING HIMSELF IN GLORY.
JAIME SMASHED THE RIVER LORDS AT THE GOLDEN TOOTH,
AND NOW LAYS SIEGE TO RIVERRUN,
CATELYN STARK'S HOMELAND.
- AND THE STARKS?
LORD EDDARD?
- IS OUR HOSTAGE.
HE WILL LEAD NO ARMIES FROM HIS DUNGEON CELL.
HOW DID MY SWEET SISTER PERSUADE THE KING
TO IMPRISON HIS DEAR FRIEND NED?
ROBERT BARATHEON IS DEAD.
JOFFREY RULES IN KING'S LANDING.
MY SISTER RULES, YOU MEAN.
STARK'S SON HAS CALLED HIS BANNERS.
HE MOVES SOUTH WITH A STRONG HOST.
A GREEN BOY.
ONE TASTE OF BATTLE AND HE'LL RUN BACK TO WINTERFELL
WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS.
MAYBE.
THOUGH THE BOY DOES HAVE A CERTAIN BELLIGERENCE.
YOU'D LIKE HIM.
WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF WAR,
I MADE PROMISES TO MY FRIENDS HERE
AND A LANNISTER ALWAYS PAYS HIS DEBTS.
WE SHALL REQUIRE 3,000 HELMS AND SHIELDS,
PLUS SWORDS,
PIKES, GORGETS, MACES...
IF IT PLEASE MY LORD, SER ADDAM BIDS ME REPORT
THAT THE NORTHMEN HAVE CROSSED THE NECK.
THE WOLF RUSHES INTO THE LION'S JAWS.
SO BE IT.
KEVAN, COMMAND THE DRUMMERS BEAT ASSEMBLY.
AND SEND WORD TO JAIME THAT I AM MOVING AGAINST ROBB STARK.
AT ONCE, MY LORD.
THE MEN OF THE MOUNTAIN CLANS ARE GREAT WARRIORS.
RIDE WITH ME AGAINST MY ENEMIES
AND YOU SHALL HAVE ALL MY SON PROMISED YOU AND MORE.
ONLY IF THE HALF MAN FIGHTS WITH US.
UNTIL WE HOLD THE STEEL HE PLEDGED US,
THE LITTLE LION'S LIFE IS OURS.
THE SCOUTS REPORT LORD TYWIN MOVES NORTH.
WE NEED TO GET HIM ON BROKEN GROUND, PUT HIS KNIGHTS AT A DISADVANTAGE.
WE NEED TO GET AROUND HIM AND BREAK LANNISTER'S SIEGE OF RIVERRUN.
DO THAT AND THE RIVER LORDS WILL JOIN US.
TO DO EITHER WE NEED TO CROSS THE RIVER AND THE ONLY CROSSING IS AT THE TWINS.
LORD FREY CONTROLS THAT BRIDGE.
YOUR FATHER'S BANNERMAN.
"THE LATE LORD FREY" MY FATHER CALLS HIM.
AT THE TRIDENT, HE DIDN'T APPEAR
UNTIL THE BATTLE WAS DONE.
SOME MEN TAKES THEIR OATHS MORE SERIOUSLY THAN OTHERS.
ROBB'S RIGHT.
WE NEED THAT BRIDGE.
SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?
DO WE MOVE AGAINST JAIME
OR LORD TYWIN?
YOUR PARDON.
WE'VE CAPTURED A LANNISTER SCOUT.
DON'T WORRY, LAD.
HE WON'T BE LEAVING THIS TENT WITH HIS HEAD.
WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM?
IN THE BRUSH ABOVE THE ENCAMPMENT.
HE LOOKED TO BE COUNTING.
HOW HIGH DID YOU GET?
20,000.
MAYBE MORE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS YOURSELF.
YOUR FATHER WOULD UNDERSTAND...
MY FATHER UNRSTANDS MERCY, WHEN THERE IS ROOM FOR IT.
AND HE UNDERSTANDS HONOR...
AND COURAGE.
LET HIM GO.
TELL LORD TYWIN WINTER IS COMING FOR HIM.
20,000 NORTHERNERS MARCHING SOUTH TO FIND OUT IF HE REALLY DOES SHIT GOLD.
YES, MY LORD.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU TOUCHED, BOY?
LETTING HIM GO?
YOU CALL ME BOY AGAIN.
GO ON.
IT IS ALSO THE WISH OF HIS GRACE
THAT HIS LOYAL SERVANT JANOS SLYNT,
- COMMANDER OF THE CITY WATCH...
- SER ARON.
... BE AT ONCE RAISED TO THE RANK OF LORD...
AND GRANTED THE ANCIENT SEAT OF HARRENHAL,
AND THAT HIS SONS AND GRANDSONS SHALL HOLD THIS HONOR AFTER HIM
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.
IN PLACE OF THE TRAITOR EDDARD STARK, IT IS THE WISH OF HIS GRACE
THAT TYWIN LANNISTER, LORD OF CASTERLY ROCK
AND WARDEN OF THE WEST,
BE APPOINTED HAND OF THE KING.
LASTLY,
IN THESE TIMES OF TREASON AND TURMOIL,
IT IS THE VIEW OF THE COUNCIL
THAT THE LIFE AND SAFETY OF KING JOFFREY
BE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE.
SER BARRISTAN SELMY.
YOUR GRACE, I AM YOURS TO COMMAND.
RISE, SER BARRISTAN.
YOU MAY REMOVE YOUR HELM.
YOU HAVE SERVED THE REALM LONG AND FAITHFULLY.
EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS OWES YOU THANKS.
BUT IT IS TIME TO PUT ASIDE YOUR ARMOR AND YOUR SWORD.
IT IS TIME TO REST AND LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE
ON YOUR MANY YEARS OF SERVICE.
THE KINGSGUARD IS A SWORN BROTHERHOOD.
OUR VOWS ARE TAKEN FOR LIFE.
ONLY DEATH RELIEVES US OF OUR SACRED TRUST.
WHOSE DEATH, SER BARRISTAN?
YOURS OR YOUR KING'S?
YOU LET MY FATHER DIE.
YOU'RE TOO OLD TO PROTECT ANYBODY.
THE COUNCIL HAS DETERMINED
THAT SER JAIME LANNISTER WILL TAKE YOUR PLACE
AS LORD COMMANDER OF THE KINGSGUARD.
HE WHO PROFANED HIS BLADE WITH THE BLOOD OF THE KING HE HAD SWORN TO DEFEND!
CAREFUL, SER.
WE HAVE NOTHING BUT GRATITUDE FOR YOUR LONG SERVICE, GOOD SER.
YOU SHALL BE GIVEN A STOUT KEEP BESIDE THE SEA,
WITH SERVANTS TO LOOK AFTER YOUR EVERY NEED.
A HOLE TO DIE IN
AND MEN TO BURY ME.
I AM A KNIGHT.
I SHALL DIE A KNIGHT.
A NAKED KNIGHT, APPARENTLY.
EVEN NOW I COULD CUT THROUGH THE FIVE OF YOU LIKE CARVING A CAKE!
HERE, BOY!
MELT IT DOWN AND ADD IT TO THE OTHERS.
IF ANY MAN IN THIS HALL HAS OTHER MATTERS
TO SET BEFORE HIS GRACE, LET HIM SPEAK NOW
OR GO FORTH AND HOLD HIS SILENCE.
YOUR GRACE.
COME FORWARD, MY LADY.
THE LADY SANSA OF HOUSE STARK.
DO YOU HAVE SOME BUSINESS FOR THE KING AND THE COUNCIL?
I DO.
AS IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE, I ASK MERCY FOR MY FATHER,
LORD EDDARD STARK, WHO WAS HAND OF THE KING.
TREASON IS A NOXIOUS WEED.
- IT SHOULD BE TORN OUT, ROOT...
- LET HER SPEAK.
I WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS.
DO YOU DENY YOUR FATHER'S CRIME?
NO, MY LORDS.
I KNOW HE MUST BE PUNISHED.
ALL I ASK IS MERCY.
I KNOW MY LORD FATHER MUST REGRET WHAT HE DID.
HE WAS KING ROBERT'S FRIEND AND HE LOVED HIM, YOU ALL KNOW IT.
HE NEVER WANTED TO BE HAND UNTIL THE KING ASKED HIM.
THEY MUST HAVE LIED TO HIM...
LORD RENLY OR LORD STANNIS,
THEY MUST HAVE LIED!
HE SAID I WASN'T THE KING.
WHY DID HE SAY THAT?
HE WAS BADLY HURT.
MAESTER PYCELLE WAS GIVING HIM MILK OF THE POPPY.
HE WASN'T HIMSELF.
OTHERWISE HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SAID IT.
A CHILD'S FAITH...
SUCH SWEET INNOCENCE.
AND YET THEY SAY WISDOM OFT COMES FROM THE MOUTHS OF BABES.
TREASON...
IS TREASON!
ANYTHING ELSE?
IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY AFFECTION IN YOUR HEART FOR ME,
PLEASE DO ME THIS KINDNESS, YOUR GRACE.
YOUR SWEET WORDS HAVE MOVED ME.
BUT YOUR FATHER HAS TO CONFESS.
HE HAS TO CONFESS AND SAY THAT I'M THE KING...
OR THERE'LL BE NO MERCY FOR HIM.
HE WILL.
[Wooden swords clacking]
Yah!
Left high, left low.
[Swords clanging, men shouting]
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
- What is...
- [Screaming]
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- Hush!
- [Swords clanging, men yelling]
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
- [Man] This way!
- [Door banging]
[Screaming]
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- l was so. I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
[Door opens]
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- l am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
[Laughs] Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
..and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
- [Wood clatters]
- What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
[Men moaning]
[Swords ringing] [Men screaming]
Not today.
Not today.
[Gasps]
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the queen.
[Chuckles] Who do you think sent me?
[Horses neighing]
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- l want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
- Stay away!
- [Gasps]
[Door clanging, creaking]
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmoured and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who sumer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
[Door creaks, clangs]
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
[Snims] What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
I Lord Commander
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
[Varys] Your father has proved to be an amul traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
[Pycelle] A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
[Sighs]
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- l won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
[Cawing]
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- l've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- l'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
[Tyrion whistling a tune]
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honour.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
[Whistles]
- [Rustling] - [Bronn whispers] Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
[Birds chirp, flutter]
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 8O with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
[Crow cawing]
[Ser Alliser] Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
[Barking, whining]
Ghost, what's wrong?
is someone out there?
[Whining and growling]
[Snarling]
[Growling]
Commander?
[Barks, whines]
Stay.
Hello?
- Who's there?
- [Whines]
- Lord Commander?
- [Door slams]
[Barking]
[Growling]
[Mormont] Snow?
Commander!
[Yelps]
[Screaming]
Move!
[Men yelling, women screaming]

[Speaks Dothraki] *Shekh ma shieraki anni zisa.* My sun and stars is hurt.
[Speaks Dothraki] *Me zisosh...* A scratch...
[Speaks Dothraki] *...zhey jalan atthirari anni.* ...moon of my life.
[Speaks Dothraki] *Finne koalaki?
* Where are the healers?
[Speaks Dothraki] *Jini osto afisi.* This is the bite of a fly.
[Speaks Dothraki] *Anha laz rhelak dothrakes vezhvena ha zisoshaan mae.* l can help the great rider with his cut.
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Khal zigeree vo rhellay ha zafroon fini govi oqet.* The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
[Speaks Dothraki] *Me anni.
Me vastoe.* She is mine.
Let her speak.
[Speaks English] Thank you, silver lady.
[Speaks English] Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Maegi.* Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Ase sekke.
Ase maegi izzi char.* Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
[Speaks Dothraki] *Azhas maan affisat zis yeri, shekh ma shieraki anni...* Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars...
[Speaks Dothraki] *...me azzisa anna jin tihat meyer qiyae.* ...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
[Men chatting]
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
[Snarls]
[Screaming]
[Snap] [Screams]
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
[Jon Umber chortles]
[All laughing]
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- l will.
- l'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
[Bran] Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
- Open your ears.
- [Leaves rustling]
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you. [Sighs]
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
[Running footsteps]
[Osha giggles] Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- [Laughs]
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
- The cold winds are rising.
- [Leaves rustling]
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- l read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
[Men chattering in camp]
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,OOO.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumours of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett ruler of the Burned Me!
n.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honour of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver. I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,OOO helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces... lf it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
[Rodrik] The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
[Grunting]
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,OOO.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honour... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
[Growls]
Oi.
[Pycelle] It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
..be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
..and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honour after him until the end of time.
[Lords mutter] ln the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armour and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride
- on your many years of service.
- [Murmuring]
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
[Joffrey] You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
[Laughter]
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
[Doors creak, clang] lf any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, Iet him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
[Steward] The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any amection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
BURN ALL THE WITCHES AND THAT ASSHOLE;
JOFFREY!
Sync, corrected Dothraki dialogue by petaia for Subscene
(Wooden swords clacking)
Yah!
Left high, left low.
(Swords clanging, men shouting)
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
- What is...
- (Screaming)
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- Hush!
- (Swords clanging, men yelling)
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
- (Man) This way!
- (Door banging)
(Screaming)
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.
I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
(Door opens)
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
(Laughs) Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
. .and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
- (Wood cIatters)
- What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
(Men moaning)
(Swords ringing) (Men screaming)
Not today.
Not today.
(Gasps)
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I 'lltellthequeen.
(Chuckles) Who do you think sent me?
(Horses neighing)
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
- Stay away!
- (Gasps)
(Door clanging, creaking)
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...
all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
(Door creaks, clangs)
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
(Sniffs) What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
(Varys) Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
(Pycelle) A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 1 0 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
(Sighs)
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
IfIcouldseemyfather , talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
(Cawing)
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
(Tyrion whistling a tune)
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price,
I'll beat it.
I like living.
(Whistles)
- (RustIing) - (Bronn whispers) Tyrion.
Tyrion.
(Birds chirp, flutter)
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of DoIf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
(Laughing)
(All laughing)
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
Myhouseisrich andpowerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
(Crow cawing)
(Ser Alliser) Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
(Barking, whining)
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is someone out there?
(Whining and growling)
(Snarling)
(Growling)
Commander?
(Barks, whines)
Stay.
Hello?
- Who's there?
- (Whines)
- Lord Commander?
- (Door slams)
(Barking)
(Growling)
(Mormont) Snow?
Commander!
(Yelps)
(Screaming)
Move!
(Men yelling, women screaming)
(Grunts)
(Screaming and yelling continue)
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold...
... andsilk,andsteel.
(Daenerys) I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
(Women screaming)
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khai.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
(Rakharo speaks Dothraki)
- Come.
- (Man speaks Dothraki)
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
(Man speaks Dothraki)
(Dothraki continues)
(Drogo speaks Dothraki)
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day...
... sotheycannotbemounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now...
... todowithasweplease.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, Iet them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
(Drogo snickers)
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
(Speaks Dothraki)
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
... untilnothingisleft ofyoubutbones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch...
... moonof my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
(Speaks English) Thank you, silver lady.
(Speaks English) Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars...
... itmakesmehurt toseeyoubleed.
(Men chatting)
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters,
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
(Snarls)
(Screaming)
(Snap) (Screams)
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat...
is bloody tough.
(Jon Umber chortles)
(All laughing)
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at WinterfeII.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'II be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
(Bran) Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
- Open your ears.
- (Leaves rustling)
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you. (Sighs)
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a Iong time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
(Running footsteps)
(Osha giggles) Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- (Laughs)
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
- The cold winds are rising.
- (Leaves rustling)
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book...
a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
(Men chattering in camp)
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 1 0 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'II shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was...
a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
1 8,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of DoIf, will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these...
companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- ls our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'II run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain beIIigerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
(Rodrik) The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
(Grunting)
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor...
and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
(Growls)
Oi.
(Pycelle) It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
. . be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
. .and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
(Lords mutter)
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride
- on your many years of service.
- (Murmuring)
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
(Joffrey) You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
(Laughter)
Even now I couId cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
(Doors creak, clang)
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
(Steward) The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester PyceIIe was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king...
or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Witch.
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
(Wooden swords clacking)
Yah!
Left high, left low.
(Swords clanging, men shouting)
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
- What is...
- (Screaming)
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- Hush!
- (Swords clanging, men yelling)
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
- (Man) This way!
- (Door banging)
(Screaming)
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- l was so. I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
(Door opens)
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- l am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
(Laughs) Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
..and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
- (Wood clatters)
- What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
(Men moaning)
(Swords ringing) (Men screaming)
Not today.
Not today.
(Gasps)
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the queen.
(Chuckles) Who do you think sent me?
(Horses neighing)
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- l want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
- Stay away!
- (Gasps)
(Door clanging, creaking)
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmoured and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who sumer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
(Door creaks, clangs)
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore om.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
(Snims) What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
I Lord Commander
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
(Varys) Your father has proved to be an amul traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
(Pycelle) A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
(Sighs)
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- l won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
(Cawing)
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- l've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- l'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
(Tyrion whistling a tune)
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honour.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
(Whistles)
- (Rustling) - (Bronn whispers) Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
(Birds chirp, flutter)
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 8O with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
(Laughing)
(All laughing)
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
(Crow cawing)
(Ser Alliser) Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
(Barking, whining)
Ghost, what's wrong?
is someone out there?
(Whining and growling)
(Snarling)
(Growling)
Commander?
(Barks, whines)
Stay.
Hello?
- Who's there?
- (Whines)
- Lord Commander?
- (Door slams)
(Barking)
(Growling)
(Mormont) Snow?
Commander!
(Yelps)
(Screaming)
Move!
(Men yelling, women screaming)
(Grunts)
(Screaming and yelling continue)
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
(Daenerys) I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
(Women screaming)
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khai.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honour.
If her wailing omends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
(Rakharo speaks Dothraki)
- Come.
- (Man speaks Dothraki)
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
(Man speaks Dothraki)
(Dothraki continues)
(Drogo speaks Dothraki)
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, Iet them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
(Drogo snickers)
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
(Speaks Dothraki)
(Speaks Dothraki)
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honour.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
(Speaks English) Thank you, silver lady.
(Speaks English) Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
(Men chatting)
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
(Snarls)
(Screaming)
(Snap) (Screams)
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
(Jon Umber chortles)
(All laughing)
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- l will.
- l'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
(Bran) Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
- Open your ears.
- (Leaves rustling) lt's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you. (Sighs)
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weiM/oods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
(Running footsteps)
(Osha giggles) Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- (Laughs)
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
- The cold winds are rising.
- (Leaves rustling)
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- l read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
(Men chattering in camp)
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,OOO.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut om his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumours of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett ruler of the Burned Me!
n.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honour of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our dimerences, Jaime and I.
He's braver. I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,OOO helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces... lf it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
(Rodrik) The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
(Grunting)
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,OOO.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honour... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
(Growls)
Oi.
(Pycelle) It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
..be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
..and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honour after him until the end of time.
(Lords mutter) ln the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armour and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride
- on your many years of service.
- (Murmuring)
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
(Joffrey) You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
(Laughter)
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
(Doors creak, clang) lf any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, Iet him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come fom/ard, my lady.
(Steward) The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
OtheM/ise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any amection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
What is...
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
' This Way!
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.
I watched, but you
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
..And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want'?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
- Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve'?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party'?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Jeffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch'?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Jeffrey puts my father in chains now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience'?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price,
I'll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon,no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is someone out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander'?
Snow?
Commander!
Move!
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khai.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Come.
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters,
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened'?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirvvoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say'?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of Dolf, will cutoff his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
..Be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
..And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
Even now I could out through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He Will.
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a ﬂy.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Witch.
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
- What is...
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
- Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
- This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
- Now you are dead.
- You said right, but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.
I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
..and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
- What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll...
I'll tell the queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!
- Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though... all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.
It's always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
- Mmm.
- The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd been dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers...
A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you - the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest,
- what's his name?
- Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If...
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
- That depends.
- On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "my lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - whatever their price,
I'll beat it.
I like living.
- Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them
Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My...
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman's promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
Now there's a rare sight...
Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is someone out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
- Who's there?
- Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move!
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk, and steel.
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khai.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,
I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
- Come.
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Moon of my life,
Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honor.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his...
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters,
I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.
- Where are you going?
- South.
For Father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh.
- Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
455 00:37:37,213 -- 00:37:40,466 Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the queen.
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- Go dress.
- Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
- The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by white walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall's high enough.
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Oh, would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope,
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us,
Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these... companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present my lord father,
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better-looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
..be at once raised to the rank of lord...
Lord Gyles.
..and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride
- on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn't the king.
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the king... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the Septa will have my head.
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
- What is it?
What's happening?
- Do as I told you.
Run!
Left, right.
Now you are dead.
You said right,
- but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.
- I watched, but you...
- Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark,
Come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
- Take her.
- Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel...
Foreign bastard.
And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the God of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.
I'll tell the Queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.
- Come here.
- Leave me be.
- My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me... the Queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...
All dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
The madness of mercy.
- That she might save her children.
- The children.
It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The Queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.
The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.
The Wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
Get them inside.
You heard him.
Lord Commander,
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers... a raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He'll tell you...
The King was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years, who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that...
What will happen to him?
That depends.
On...
- On what?
- On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.
His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, My Lord?
They've all sworn to defend my father?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you're not stupid.
You've had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
- I've shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
I'm hungry.
Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Will you shut up?
There's hill tribes all around here.
If I'm going to die, it mays as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don't think I'd do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship,
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this:
Whatever their price,
I'll beat it.
I like living.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your Gods, you tell them
Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
My House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a half man's promises.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,
I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is "this"?
The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
Now there's a rare sight... not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
Stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You'll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You're confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what's wrong?
Is something out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
Move!
What did they do?
I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
You have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
Come.
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his... lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
For 30 years
I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters,
I'll march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat... is bloody tough.
- What is it?
What's happened?
- It's all right.
Where are you going?
South.
For father.
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They've all gone away.
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.
No, they won't.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The Old Gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You're not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
You asked them, they're answering you.
Open your ears.
It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there's a big man.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not South!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
What else did the book say?
The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
And when they wake up, what?
I hope The Wall is high enough.
Summer snows, My Lady.
Robb's brought the North with him.
The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts
10 times as large.
You look well.
You're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
You heard her!
Move your asses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
You old devil, Rodrik.
You're not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
- There was no one else.
- No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Would that I could.
There was... a letter.
From Sansa.
From the Queen, you mean.
There's no mention of Arya.
How many men do you have?
18,000.
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
You would never be allowed to leave.
Our best hope, our only hope... is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children when the Mad King fell?
They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us,
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood...
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then.
Time to meet my father.
Uncle.
Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver.
I'm better looking.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.
- And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
He moves south with a strong host.
A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war,
I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces... if it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, My Lord.
The men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves North.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
We need to get around him and break Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
So what's it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
20,000.
Maybe more.
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...
My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor... and courage.
Let him go.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
20,000 northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, My Lord.
Thank you.
Are you touched, boy?
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.
... be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time.
In place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey
be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
The Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
He who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hole to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight.
I shall die a Knight.
A naked Knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now
or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him, you all know it.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him...
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis, they must have lied!
He said I wasn't the King.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child's faith...
such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason... is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King... or there'll be no mercy for him.
He will.
2012 ICE AGE (2011)
Blue team to base camp.
Go, blue team.
Are you getting this?
The seismic activity seems to be increasing exponentially.
I'm heading north on the shelf to collect more data.
Copy.
Blue team, reports show... the Hekla volcano is having immense seismic readings.
Proceed with caution.
Copy that.
Base camp, we're seeing intense magna flow... running up and down the range.
If it keeps increasing, we may have to evacuate the area now.
All the local areas.
Base camp, if the whole range starts erupting,
We're looking at a whole glacier detaching from the shelf.
[Horns honking]
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Can I really talk to base on this thing?
Oh, absolutely.
I talk to them all the time.
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Try a lower band.
There you go.
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
[Sighs] Just can't get it.
There's too much interference.
I'm going to take down a plane with this thing.
Better not.
Hey, did you pack your gortex?
Hello?
Julia?
Julia?
Unbelievable.
You heard me a second ago.
Mom packed it.
Well, good, I'm glad.
You know, it gets cold in New York, Julia.
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Summit camp, come in.
Dad, I think i just got 'em.
Oh, great.
6SNL7, come in.
Dad, I'm gonna miss my flight!
Hold on.
Dad, this is my terminal.
Dad!
6SNL7, come in.
This is summit camp.
Go ahead.
Divya?
Hey, I wanted to let you know... that I'm bringing some new instruments next week.
Bill, have you looked at the data we sent?
No, no, no.
I'm not in the office.
I'm dropping Julia off at the airport.
- Why?
What's up?
- We're evacuating.
The rest of the team is gone already.
I'm the last man standing.
Evacuating?
Why?
Dad, I should just walk from here.
Hekla went berserk.
There's a huge pressure buildup.
The endurance readings are off the chart.
The entire Hekla line is erupting.
There is pressure building up everywhere.
Bill, I've never seen anything like this.
Pressure building up where?
At what site?
I'm trying.
Guys, hold on.
We're seeing activity across the entire range.
Wait, at all the sites?
That doesn't make any sense, Divya.
I checked with the other stations.
No one's ever seen anything like this.
I sent you everything we got
Before the centers melted down, Bill.
Look at the data!
No, I'm not at the office.
I'll be there in an hour.
Pull up the computer simulation.
Divya, can you read me?
Divya?
[Horns honking]
Okay, I'm going back to school now.
No need to say goodbye or anything.
Reykjanes ridge?
Yeah.
Divya, are you there?
Magna flow rate?
F7.
Divya, can you read me?
Right, I'll be back around christmastime
Unless I decide to stay in New York forever.
Divya, come in.
Divya, if you can still hear me,
I will look at the data... and I will contact you... as soon as I get to the office.
Divya, are you there?
6SNL7, come in.
5-3-7-6-E-9.
6SNL7, do you copy?
Sir, you're going to need to move your car.
It's fine.
I'm just dropping my daughter off.
We'll be two minutes.
6SNL7, do you read?
Sir?
Oh, my god.
Come in, 6SNL7.
Do you read?
Sir, you're gonna have to move your car.
Sir?
Hart, do you read me?
Yes, go ahead, Divya.
I read you.
Go ahead.
I can't believe what's happening!
The entire range is on fire!
Sir, this is a no parking zone.
This is loading and unloading only.
I need you to move your...
This is massive!
What's happening?
The entire range is on fire!
Every single volcano is erupting!
Say again.
I couldn't understand.
The entire ice shelf is fracturing!
It's 1,000 miles long!
Bill, do you read me?
[Alarm beeps]
[Static]
Something about the volcano.
Is not moving.
Dad, we need to go.
Look.
Yeah.
Where's Julia?
She left, like, two minutes ago.
What?
Ah, crap.
You want me to drive, dad?
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just can't believe I missed her.
I can't believe I didn't say goodbye to your sister.
Mom's gonna kill you.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Dad, what is Dr. Chandra saying about the glacier?
Did it calf?
Well, it's possible,
But it sounded a lot bigger than that.
That would be sick.
Sick, huh?
100%.
Why don't you bring up the simulation again... on the parameter screen, okay?
Okay, let's see.
Okay, using these numbers,
See what you can come up with... for the ice flow projection, okay?
I'll be right back.
Roy?
Bill?
What're you doing here?
I thought you were out in the field.
I just spoke with Divya,
And he had sent you some data.
Did you receive it?
Yeah, the Hekla volcano just erupted.
No, but it sounded more than the Hekla, like the whole range went up.
We know.
Hart, go home.
We've got this.
I could be pulling maps or crunching numbers.
Why are you trying to send me home?
Bill, we don't need you.
Roy, look, we've been friends for 15 years.
What the hell's going on here?
Bill, I have just put Cynthia and my kids... on a plane to Mexico.
You do the same.
We have got chunks of ice... falling all over Canada.
In 19 hours, the bulk of the glacier... is going to hit North America.
Bill, get your family out now.
What did you get?
It won't let me input this data.
Okay.
Well, let's open up a terminal window... and we'll enter sandbox mode.
What's that?
Well, it's a mode that allows you... to enter in variables that are theoretically impossible.
What does that mean?
It means we gotta get your mom.
Why?
Right now.
I'll tell you on the way.
Hold on.
Excuse me, senator.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
But I just got off the phone with Cyrus... over Atmair traffic services, and he said that all the flights are grounded... because of the volcanic ash flow.
Get Quincy in DC and ask him... if they're gonna postpone the summit.
Yes, senator.
Hey.
Your daughter's flying out today.
Yes.
Starting college.
NYU.
Teri, these volcanoes are in Greenland.
Julia's flying into New York.
She'll be fine.
I hope so.
I'm sure you're right, sir.
Thank you.
Teri?
Teri?
Teri?
Bill, what are you doing here?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to Julia?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to Julia?
No, no.
Julia is fine.
Everything's fine.
Okay, thank you.
Please don't scare me like that.
What are you doing here?
I was talking to Divya about the Petermann glacier.
Divya?
Petermann?
What is that?
Hi, Bill.
Hi, senator.
Is everything all right with Julia?
Everything's fine with Julia, senator.
Sorry to disturb you.
But you need to leave town right now, sir.
Bill!
Bill was just leaving, senator.
So sorry to disturb you.
Look, there is a huge glacier coming our way,
And it's coming at us really, really quick.
We gotta get outta town!
Listen, I have a summit meeting.
No, no, no.
I understand.
Mom, mom!
This is true!
We have to get out of Maine.
Really?
You're gonna bring our son into all your weather...
It's true!
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.
Hi, Josh.
Hi.
Hey, Bill.
I can't seem to get anybody... on the phone about the summit.
Not even the white house is picking up.
You'd better be right about this.
Josh, go home.
What?
No, don't go home.
Get out of Maine.
Go as far south as you can!
What's going on?
[Teri]:
Don't scare him like that!
Eagle Cliff, flight deck.
Requesting sat-com coordinates.
Over.
Hold for GPS.
Glacier located.
58-42 north, 39-02 west,
Bearing 210.
Over.
Copy that.
Eagle Cliff flight deck clear.
Foxtrot, whiskey, 8-7-0 clear to take off.
Roger, I'm getting a visual now.
This is Foxtrot, Whiskey, 8-7-0.
It's heading towards Newfoundland.
Why is it getting darker?
The weather's changing.
Dad, are your headlights on?
Give me your phone.
I need to call Julia.
Can we go home first?
I need to get my laptop.
We have to get out of town.
[Telephone ringing]
She's not picking up.
I don't understand this.
Don't they have Wi-Fi on airplanes?
Maybe if she was flying first class.
She shouldn't have even been flying at all today.
Not today.
Don't worry.
She's gonna be landing soon.
We'll get hold of her.
It'll be okay.
Whoa.
Use words, Nelson.
I don't think I can.
What?
Well, we're not going back home.
Why not?
Don't have enough time.
Look at the clouds.
What can do that?
Glaciers.
Really, really fast glaciers.
Okay, so where we going?
New York.
Take us about 7, 8 hours.
Hey.
Hey!
[Laughs]
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Sorry it took me so long.
Traffic was a mess.
I know.
They grounded all the flights.
They did?
- Damn.
- Mm-Hmm.
Guess we're gonna be here a while, huh?
Well, that's not such a bad thing.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
[Cell phone buzzes]
Oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
Who's that?
No one.
Let's go back to the dorm and fool around.
All right.
Sounds good to me.
Julia, we're on our way to New York.
We're gonna meet you at your dorm, okay, honey?
So when you get to the dorm, just stay there, all right?
We're gonna meet you there.
All right, big hugs, and love you.
Love you, love you, love you.
Bye.
Are you sure that New York is safe?
Bill?
How stupid.
Why don't we just have her fly and meet us down in Florida?
Sweetheart, everything is grounded.
I say we stay on plan... and we just meet her at the dorm.
Fine.
Oh, my gosh!
It's okay, it's okay.
We're okay.
Dad, I think it's coming faster than we thought!
Have you ever seen this?
No.
The glaciers are making it snow in Maine?
It's summer.
Can you just get us out of Maine now?
How big do these glaciers have to be to do this?
Bill?
[Horns honking]
Crap.
Dad, does this snow mean the glacier's getting close?
Bill, it has to because the clouds are looking massive.
I bet this glacier is enormous,
Like the whole shelf.
Yeah.
Okay, here's what we got to do.
I got to find a way around this traffic.
Nelson, jump on the GPS and find me an alternate route.
On it.
Bill, get us out of here now!
We don't know if the glacier is close.
Those military planes?
F-16s.
Nelson, focus.
GPS.
Target is 400 miles off the Northeast coast... and is now in range.
Sir, I don't see anything.
Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you.
Negative, Alpha Foxtrot.
I see nothing.
Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you.
Negative, Alpha Foxtrot.
There is nothing.
Delta Bravo One, look again.
Holy sh...
Pull up!
Pull up!
Pull up!
Delta Bravo One, do you read me?
Delta Bravo One?
Alpha Foxtrot, this is control.
Fire sequence in 3... 2... 1... fire!
Oh, my god!
Dad, get us out of here!
Is everybody okay?
Is it gone?
I don't know.
I don't see anything.
I think we outran it.
What do you think, Bill?
Do you think it's gone?
I just don't know.
Maybe we should just pull over.
No, not yet, not yet.
Everything is gone, isn't it?
Just don't even think about it, all right, Nelson?
Everything.
God, my friends.
I need to get online!
No, no.
You need to focus on what's important, okay?
This is important!
No, this is not important!
[Cell phone rings]
Mom, your cell phone.
It's Julia.
Julia?
Julia!
Mom!
Oh, my god.
Is everyone okay?
We're fine.
We're fine.
Dad's here and Nelson's here.
[Julia]:
What happened?
We don't know.
The news is saying that Bangor just got destroyed.
Tell her we're coming to New York.
We're coming to New York.
[Nelson]:
Mom, can I just talk to her?
Tell her that we'll be at her dorm... in six hours from now.
We're gonna be at your dorm in six hours, okay?
Can you hear me?
Julia?
Julia?
[Static]
Hello?
Let me talk to her.
Julia, listen.
If the weather breaks, head south to Florida... to your aunt Kissy's house.
The further south you go, the safer it is.
Julia?
Hello?
Julia?
Hello?
Sweetheart, if you can...
[breaking up]
Mom?
Lost it.
Dad, I wanted to talk to her.
Sorry, buddy.
Well, what?
My parents are coming for me.
I think they want us to stay at the dorm.
Well, we should get going then.
Yeah.
It's getting cold fast.
Come on!
[Announcer]:
Evacuation is mandatory... in most Northeast coastal towns.
We've been informed, following an onsite evaluation, the president will hold a press conference... with the most current update.
The military currently has Awac in the air... assessing the threat.
Dropping out at 400.
Target is breaking up, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference.
Say again, Johnny Bravo.
Target is separating into multiple sections... and there's still a lot... heading south down the coast.
Wow.
Cloud cover's just so thick, it looks like night.
I'm getting nothing.
I'm trying to call her back.
[Busy signal]
Look, she's gonna be okay, okay?
We're gonna be okay.
We're all gonna be okay.
[Busy signal]
Can't get hold of the senator.
Can't get hold of anybody.
[Busy signal]
Dad, you said the Petermann glacier was how big?
Let's see, the last calving happened in 2010.
That was about 100 square miles,
Which is roughly four times the size of Manhattan,
And that was only 8% of the glacier.
This sounds like it's the whole glacier.
With enough speed, who knows how much damage it could do?
What?
Dad!
[Shouting and screaming]
Which way's your room?
This way.
Come on.
Karen!
Oh, my god, Julia.
I can't get hold of anyone in Maine.
Just try again, okay?
It took me three tries.
Keep trying.
Right, right.
Keep trying.
[Thunder]
Is there a basement?
No, there'd be no reception in the basement.
I'm gonna keep trying.
Come on, Julia!
No, that's a mistake.
No, Julia, we have to go!
[Groaning and creaking]
What was that?
I don't know.
Hurry!
Put your jacket on.
We gotta go.
But my dad said to stay here.
I know.
Call him and tell him,
But we aren't staying here, Julia!
Mom!
Dad!
We're not staying here.
The dorms aren't safe!
I'll give you a call when we...
I lost the signal.
You think the message went through?
I hope so.
So then what now?
How do we get outta the city?
Everything's shut down.
We get to one of the bridges and get across the river!
Wait, wait, wait!
Julia, what about the subway?
The subways are shut down, too.
I'm not talking about the train, Julia.
I'm talking about the tunnels.
We can make it through one of those.
You really think that'll work?
Would you rather stay up here?
Come on!
Oh... oh.
You okay?
I'm okay, dad.
Yeah, yeah.
We're okay.
We'll work our way out.
Come on.
Nelson's okay.
We're good.
The sun is breaking through.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
You okay?
You all right?
You're bleeding.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's just a cut.
Come on.
Get Nelson.
Come on, sweetie.
Nelson?
You okay?
Baby, you all right?
Okay.
Broken bones?
No.
Anything?
Okay.
All right, guys, okay.
Good job.
I love you so much.
It's gonna be all right.
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, dad.
- Good job.
Okay, let's get moving.
Let's go.
We got to get away from the car.
Keep going.
Come on.
We need to find another car.
See if that van works.
Okay, guys, come on.
[Cough] Come on.
[Nelson]:
So cold.
There's no one here.
Okay, guys, get in.
Get in, honey.
Look for some keys.
I'm gonna check this out.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
Where's dad going?
I don't know.
He'll be back.
Give me your hands.
Hello?
Hello?
Where's dad?
I don't know.
He'll be back, though, honey.
Mom, the keys are in the ignition.
Oh, good.
Let's start it.
[Engine won't start]
Come on.
Try again.
[Engine starts]
Yes!
Okay, good.
It's a mess in here.
Smells like shit.
Oh, good.
You got it running.
Yeah.
Okay, bad news.
There's a big pileup.
We gotta find a way...
[Sniffing] What's that smell?
I think it's manure or something.
It smells awful.
Manure?
Like fertilizer?
Yeah.
What kind?
I don't know.
What're you doing, honey?
Just a little science project.
Excellent.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Where'd he go?
[Crash]
What was that?
I don't know.
I hope dad comes back soon.
Okay, inside.
Go.
Okay, heads down.
Heads down.
Here we go.
Heads down.
Okay, why?
Just a little science experiment.
What kinda science experiment, Bill?
The kind that goes boom.
See, when you take ammonium nitrate... and you had a little bit of diesel fuel, you get...
Whoa!
Dad, where'd you learn to do that?
In science class.
[Phone beeps]
Oh, god, Bill.
I have phone reception, I think.
I do.
I have phone reception.
Pull over.
Pull over right now!
Mom got a reception?
Yeah.
Well?
Mom, dad, it's Julia.
It's Julia.
Where we going to go?
Mom, dad, we're not staying here.
Nelson, get on the shortwave.
The dorms aren't safe.
I'll give you a call...
Something bad has hit her dorm.
What happened?
I don't know.
I'm playing it again.
Mom, dad, it's Julia.
We're not safe...
Something's hit the dorm really bad and she's trying to get out.
We're not staying here.
The dorms aren't safe.
She's saying she cannot get out of New York city.
- [Explosion]
- What the heck was that?
It's a sonic boom.
10 birds in formation.
They're gonna go bomb the glacier.
Can they do that?
Can they bomb a glacier, Bill?
Yeah, they could do that, but they'd need to hit it with a nuclear bomb... to stop this thing.
That's what they're doing.
They said Boston's gonna be hit next...
If they don't stop it.
Boston?
We have gotta get to New York City right now.
We gotta get out of here.
Oscar Charlie and Delta X-Ray approaching target.
Roger, Oscar Charlie.
Ordering nuclear payload active.
Nukes are hot, waiting for countdown.
My son was born in Boston, so let's melt this ice.
Roger that.
Fire one!
Oscar Charlie, do you have a visual?
Checking now.
Command 483.
Nukes deployed, but they have no visual effect.
Waiting on next command.
Everyone looks so scared.
Why are we stopping?
Look, we got this big empty van, all these people need help.
I figure, you know, we'll open up a door...
Our daughter's in New York.
We need to get her, and she is our priority.
She's our top priority, and we're on our way to New York.
I figure we can have a couple people... ride with us to New York.
It'll take two minutes...
No!
Two minutes?
Yeah, two minutes.
Honey, we just can't leave people out there.
Honey?
Mom, dad... hear that?
Everybody okay?
I don't hear anything.
I think we made it.
Let's keep going.
What happened?
Boston's been hit!
The glacier's less than an hour from us!
It's headed right for us!
It's too late.
We have to tell my parents not to come.
[Telephone ringing]
All the circuits are busy.
No surprise there.
Keep it on.
We'll try again later.
We got to keep moving.
Come on.
Babe, I know where we are.
We could take a tunnel.
We tried them all.
They're closed!
Trust me!
Go, go.
Hurry.
Hurry!
Be careful.
Careful.
We used to go this way when we were, like, 12.
Just need to find a light.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
We really have to go down there?
Yeah.
It's safer than up there.
Oh, god.
What if my parents try to make it to New York?
They're going to get your message.
Yeah, but what if...
They'll get the message.
Hey, guys, we're gonna need to find some gas soon.
I can log on and find us a gas station.
I don't think that's gonna happen, honey.
Power grid is down, buddy.
That means no Wi-Fi, no gas stations.
I'm really hungry.
We just need to find him some food... and let's find some gas.
All right?
Let's just start looking for something.
Dad, look!
You can siphon gas.
Great idea.
Okay, guys, let's start looking for cars,
Hopefully filled with food.
Hang in there, Nelson.
We're almost in New York, okay?
Slow down, slow down, Bill.
I think I see some cars in the distance.
[Nelson]:
It's just so creepy... when it gets dark in the middle of the day.
Honey, just get what we need and get back.
Be careful.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if anyone's in there.
Just stay there.
Why?
Just stay there.
All right.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
I can do this.
I got this.
All right.
I'm gonna go pee.
Okay.
[Coughs]
I'm glad that was you and not me.
Yeah, me, too.
It's working.
That is some strong stuff.
Whew!
Hey, we're in Connecticut.
Honey?
I'm not stopping.
It's pitch black.
Hey, Nelson, have you been able... to pull up anything on the GPS?
Not really.
Are you kidding me?
What?
Hand 'em over.
Unbelievable.
You got anything else back there, chef Nelson?
Oh, man!
I was gonna tell you guys.
Yeah, sure you were.
Dinner?
Thanks.
Thank you, honey.
Nelson, how much longer to New York?
About two hours.
You think she's still at the dorm?
I'm sure your sister's fine.
She's a smart girl and she can take care of herself.
It's this way.
You sure we're going the right way?
I mean, you haven't been down here in 10 years.
You have to calm down and trust me, okay?
It's the only way, Julia.
It feels like we're going deeper, though.
[Creaking]
What was that?
Oh, god, I don't know.
Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good.
Come on.
[Creaking and groaning]
Wow.
It sounds like it's getting worse.
Come on.
Let's keep moving.
[Nelson]:
Dad, I got a frequency.
[Radio broadcast breaking up]
Go Henry. 11-41 and 44th and... intersection.
[Transmission breaking up] 10-4...
LB.
AJ4-LB.
Turn to channel 3 for further details.
Copy that.
Thank you.
You okay?
Do you want me to drive?
You know, i didn't say goodbye.
She got out of the car
And I didn't even know it.
We're almost to New York,
And you're gonna get to see her again.
We're gonna get to see her again, okay?
Oh, crap.
Stay here.
Are we in New York?
Not yet, honey.
Not yet.
Hey!
Hey!
Is your car working?
No, it's out of gas.
Oh, gas, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But you're cool with that, right?
I mean, you're stuck, but you're okay, right?
Yeah, yeah, we'll figure it out.
Right.
Are you okay?
Why do you say that?
No reason.
Hey, hey!
Are you alone?
Hey, are you alone?
'Cause I'm alone.
I'm here with my family.
Oh, that's cool, that's cool.
Hey, you know, it's really cold out here, right?
I mean, I should probably get someplace warm.
Yeah, I'd say find yourself a car and stay inside.
Yeah, yeah, no, no.
I'll get a car.
I'll go to California.
You know, hey, I'll go to the beach... and the pretty blonde women.
Maybe have tequilas on the beach.
That sounds like a good plan.
Nice meeting you.
No, no, hey, hey, hey!
I'm thinking that, you know,
You and I could go to California together.
No, we're going to New York.
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, yeah.
But, you know, New York's really cold, and, you know, we need to go someplace that's warm.
Look, I'm not gonna go anywhere with you, okay?
You got that?
Except you're not gonna leave me.
Again, you go.
We need to go to California.
Just calm down.
I got my family right there.
Just calm down.
Look at me!
We're going to California.
I got some money.
That can help.
I don't want your money.
I got some food if you want some food.
I don't want your food.
Hey, what kind of food you got?
I need to get into the van.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, no, yeah.
No, go, go, go.
Get in.
Nelson, give me a bag of chips.
Bill?
Bill, hey, hey.
Your name is Bill.
Bill, hey, I'm Gary.
I'm gary Morganson.
Hey, Gary.
Yeah, hey.
You know, I'm thinking maybe...
I need to get in the car.
No, we're going to New York, remember?
Here's your food.
No, no, no.
I'm thinking that
I should get in the car with you guys.
No, no, no.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Bill, come on.
I'm not a bad guy.
I hear you.
No, no, I'm a good guy.
I'm a great guy.
I just wanna go someplace warm, you know?
I mean...
Hey, hey, kid, kid, kid, kid!
Lock the doors, Nelson, lock the doors!
Dad, do something!
[Teri]:
Bill, get us out of here now!
[Bill]:
I can't we're blocked in.
[Nelson]:
My sister's in New York!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Lock the doors, Nelson.
Lock the doors!
You guys think I'm kidding?
Calm down, man.
Think I'm joking around?
You're dead.
You're dead!
Your whole frigging family is dead!
All of you are frigging dead!
You're dead!
Open the door, kid.
[Bill]:
Everybody out.
Come on.
Come on, Teri, out.
Get out, Nelson.
Get out.
Go with your dad.
[Nelson]:
What're we supposed to do?
Follow your dad, Nelson.
Nelson, over here.
He has the radio gear!
Nelson, don't do it!
No!
No, Nelson!
Nelson, come back!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson, what the hell were you doing?
I got it!
I got it!
Don't ever do that again!
Please.
Oh, god!
No!
No!
No!
No!
[Screaming]
The ice!
Let's run!
Watch out!
Come on, guys.
We're almost there.
We did it.
It's snowing again.
Okay, let's get another vehicle.
Let's try this way.
Come on.
Where are we?
It's the Lincoln tunnel.
We can take this all the way to New Jersey.
And how far is that?
It's about a mile.
Come on.
[Bill]:
Come on.
Dad, I don't think I can keep going.
Got to keep moving.
If we stop, we die.
Let's just go.
Honey, is that a house?
Sure looks like it.
Come on.
Can we go?
Yep, let's try it.
Come on.
It's so cold.
All right, I know, guys.
It's so cold.
Hello!
Hello!
Come on in, guys.
Sit down.
Get warm.
Hello?
I didn't see a car out front.
Looks like they left here pretty quickly.
Here.
Why don't you go see if you find some clothes,
See if you can find some food,
And be quick about it because we gotta get out of here.
Hello?
Hello?
[Crying]
Don't worry, baby.
We haven't forgotten about you.
We haven't forgotten you, Julia.
Here, honey, I found these upstairs.
Oh, great.
Here you go.
Should we just let him sleep?
No, no, no.
We gotta get going.
It may look like night, but it's only 3:00 pm.
Come on, wake up, Nelson.
It's time to go.
We don't have a car.
We don't have a car.
We gotta do it on foot.
Get going and maybe we can find one on the way.
Here, honey.
Shh.
What was that?
Hello?
We're just here for some warm clothes.
We're leaving now.
Thank you!
Wait!
Wait!
My daddy's hurt.
Wesley, come here.
Oh, thank god.
I think he came this way.
Oh.
I found people.
Listen to me.
Don't you ever leave me, okay?
Hey, are you all right?
Can we help?
You okay?
I was trying to load our truck up
And this whole thing fell on me.
It's got my leg pinned down here.
Okay, on the count of three, guys.
You ready?
One, two, three... let it go.
Let it go.
I think if you lift it straight up,
I can probably shimmy out.
Okay, ready?
Got it?
Oh, yeah.
You got it?
You clear?
Yeah.
Here.
Get up.
Daddy, you're bleeding.
I'll be okay, son.
Man, thank god you guys came along.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
We lost our van at the river... and your place was the first place we came upon.
I have a vest just like that.
Oh, yeah.
Actually, this is your vest.
We kind of broke into your place.
We didn't know anyone was here.
Relax.
Look, anything you need here,
Feel free to help yourself.
Besides, this place isn't even gonna be here in a hour.
Are we gonna fly now?
No, we're gonna take the truck, remember?
Look, you guys, we have plenty of room.
You're more than welcome to join us.
Which way you guys headed?
You know, we're gonna head west.
Yeah, we're headed to New York.
New York?
That's the last place you wanna go.
This iceberg is chewing up the entire east coast.
In a couple of hours, there's not gonna be a New York.
Our daughter's in New York.
Well, you do what you gotta do.
Me and Wesley, we're going west.
Hey, is this what I think it is?
My daddy can fly.
So can mine.
Does this still work?
Sure does.
Me and wesley would probably be in jamaica by now,
But only a fool would go up in this weather.
Guys, we're all packed up.
We're gonna head out.
You're still more than welcome to join us.
I know we talked about this, but I think I should go
And I'll meet you guys in Florida.
I am not leaving you, ever.
Dad, dad, you need me to navigate.
Okay.
Good luck.
You, too.
Nelson.
Okay, Nelson, get this out of the tarp.
Let's go.
Be careful.
How long do you think we have until the glacier gets here?
You hear that?
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Not long.
Let's go.
Come on!
Go!
There it is!
Jersey!
Come on, Julia!
[Sirens]
Come on!
We got to go!
Are we gonna be able to take off in this kind of weather?
Yeah, no problem.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?
All right, dad!
[Laughs]
We can probably be in New York in 30 minutes.
Just sit back and enjoy this bumpy ride.
These clouds don't look normal.
[Teri]:
Nothing looks normal.
Is that a twister?
Bill, fly us out of here.
What's wrong?
Can you fly above it?
I don't know.
Don't we have a weather detection device?
I don't see one.
Bill, we're flying right into the thick of that.
Hold on!
Dad, you got to get us out of here!
Fly higher!
Higher, Bill!
Ha ha!
Amazing, dad.
Dad!
Two o'clock!
Look!
Are they gonna go bomb the glacier?
I have no idea.
[Pilot]:
Everything proceeding properly, approaching glacier.
Roger that.
We're at the observation location.
We're at an altitude of 3-500 feet
And six miles from location impact.
We need the coordinates to plant the explosions.
Roger that.
Sending them now.
Teams five and six have landed, waiting for supplies.
Roger that.
We are descending now.
Lieutenant colonel Sinor, an hour till impact.
Affirmative?
63 minutes, major.
Roger that.
Come on, come on, get it, go, go!
Lieutenant colonel Sinor, how long until the payload drop?
Arriving now.
Roger that.
Come on.
We have to find shelter.
I have to tell my parents I'm in jersey.
We will.
Come on.
Can we just stop?
I'm tired.
Not yet.
We have to keep going.
Come on.
Hey!
Aah!
Aah!
Give me your coat!
Hey, let her go!
- What are you doing?
- Stop!
Let him go!
Give me your coat or I'm gonna kill you!
Stop!
Stop!
[Man]:
National Guard!
Stop!
Are you okay?
Stop!
What the hell are you two doing out here?
This city's been evacuated!
- To where?
- To shelters.
Hell, you guys are lucky I found you.
I was on my last sweep.
Let's go!
But what about the glacier?
Isn't it headed right for us?
Not for long.
There's a combined taskforce on its way to meet it.
So you've declared war on a glacier?
That's right.
It's the last chunk of the glacier, and they're putting everything they have on it.
Now get your asses inside before I have you arrested!
Go!
Go!
That's the last of the explosives, major.
Good, good!
All explosives have been deployed.
Roger that.
The charges are in place!
Take us back home!
Copy that.
Prepare for extraction.
Roger that.
Hey, Nelson.
Grab the computer.
I wanna find out... if we can connect to a satellite at this altitude.
Got it.
Should take a sec.
Reception blows up here.
I got a signal.
What do you want me to do?
Okay, I want you to connect up to the noaa website.
I wanna find out where that glacier is right now.
Got it.
What's the login?
Login is username Julia,
Password, Nelson.
Dad, that's lame.
That is sweet.
Lame or not, open up the tracking program.
Now run the simulation with the same coordinates,
But put in our GPS location right now.
What are you looking for?
Trying to find out how far away we are from that glacier.
Okay, it's 50 miles behind us.
It's moving at 200 miles an hour.
What?
How can a glacier move at 200 miles per hour?
I have no idea.
I don't think anybody else does either.
Can we outrun that?
Are we gonna make it on time?
Let's find out.
What's wrong?
We're icing up.
Doesn't this model have de-icers?
No.
We're gonna have to fly low if we're gonna make it.
We're burning fuel like crazy.
I need you guys to look outside... and see if you can find any kind of private airfield, a crop dusting operation, anything.
You guys finding anything?
How far away are we from New York?
Can't be more than 100 miles.
You guys seeing anything?
I don't see anything.
This visibility sucks balls.
Nelson!
Okay, guys, hold on.
We're gonna go lower.
Anything?
Nope, nothing.
We're still collecting a lotta ice.
I may have to put her down at any time, guys.
How much more ice can this thing take?
Not a lot.
These headwinds are killing us.
We could walk there faster.
How much further is it?
About another 10 minutes.
I'm gonna try to land her at Newark or La Quardia.
Will they allow us to land without a flight plan?
Well, I'll just radio ahead... and tell them we're an emergency.
They have to let us land.
What if there's no one there to hear us?
Oh, crap!
[Teri]:
What?
We just ran out of fuel in the right fuel tank!
Okay, guys, strap yourselves in.
Get ready.
We're gonna have to go for an emergency landing.
Really, Bill?
Yes!
Get ready!
God, look at all of these people.
Well, at least we get free cookies.
You think your parents are still trying to find us?
I hope so.
What about your family?
Dad's in northern Europe near Oslo.
It's probably the first hit.
It's okay.
I'm happy to be with you.
Okay, you guys.
We gotta get serious about finding another place to land, because we're not gonna make it to Newark.
We're entering into the New York air corridor now.
I'm gonna get on the radio... and see if anybody's there listening.
Give me the radio there, Nelson.
Newark tower, this is Cessna... where's the flight number?
Give me the flight number.
This is cessna number November niner, niner, 7-2-5.
Declaring an emergency.
Do you copy?
Can they even hear us?
Oh, I don't know.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, we're gonna find a hole and slip into it.
Buckle up, guys.
One way or another, we're gonna be on the ground... in a couple of minutes, so hold on.
I need you guys to look around... to see if you can see any other aircraft...
That might be landing without tower permission, okay?
Brace yourselves!
Two o'clock!
Look!
You okay?
You all right?
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay.
We're down.
Okay, okay.
Let's get out, guys.
Come on.
Come on out.
Come on, guys.
Here we go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Well, I guess we got out just in time.
Hey, guys, look.
It's New York.
We did it!
Almost there.
Yeah. [Laughs]
Did you crash that one eighty?
Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
I got all the insurance information if you need it.
If a crashed Cessna was all we had to worry about,
I'd call it a good day.
Come with me.
Let's get you into someplace safe.
Colonel sinor, this is command.
We are less than 30 seconds from detonation.
Roger that.
We are all clear and standing by.
Give me a long count, captain.
Fire!
[Laughs]
We got to get out of here.
Were you guys headed into Manhattan?
Yeah, because we're trying to get our daughter.
I'm sorry.
No one's getting in and out of New York alive.
Just stay here.
The National Guard's gonna be here to get you.
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.
I'll be right...
Oh!
Oh!
Come on, get back!
Get back!
We just gotta stay away from tall buildings... with lots of glass, got it?
Dad, we're going to Manhattan.
Point taken.
So how we gonna get there?
We got to get ourselves another car... and then just drive into the city.
- And go where?
- To the dorm.
The dorm?
She's not at the dorm and you know that.
We can only hope she got our message.
What, to go to Florida?
Look, she may not be in New York,
But we have start there.
From there, maybe we'll be able to find
Some sort of clue where she...
Are you willing to sacrifice?
Hey, guys!
Are we going or what?
Were the keys in the ignition?
I don't wanna know.
I don't even want to know.
Let's just go.
I'm gonna try and get hold of her again.
If we're in jersey, how far is New York?
Well, it shouldn't be too much longer.
We're coming up to the george washington bridge.
No signal.
It just keeps saying that all circuits are busy now.
It's not going through.
We just need to get under the gw.
I'll try to get the gps running.
Is everyone trying to get to New York?
Look at that mess.
Nelson, see if you can find another way to the bridge.
Sir, you're gonna have to turn your car around.
You can't get through here.
We have to get to Manhattan.
That's impossible.
No one's going over there.
No, our daughter is there, and we need to pick her up.
I don't care if the pope's over there.
No one's going in New York right now.
Look, it's not gonna matter soon anyway.
Please just let us go.
But you can't go.
Washington bridge, it's out.
Wow!
The Air Force is coming in for their last air strike.
Let's hope that does it,
Or maybe none of us will get out of here.
Come on, let's go!
What are you gonna do now, Bill?
I don't know.
I'm out of ideas.
I know that's not true.
I know that you're thinking something.
What?
Oh, it's just that
Remember when the kids were really, really young... and we thought that if we could put... some sort of tracking device on them, we'd always know where they are?
I knew I should have invented that device.
Damn it!
Wait, wait, guys!
We do have a tracking device!
What are you talking about, Nelson?
Oh, of course!
Of course what?
Even if we can't talk to her on her phone, we can track her phone.
Really?
We can do that?
Yes.
Isn't that illegal?
Don't ask.
I got it!
She's in New Jersey!
New Jersey?
She's here!
She's in New Jersey!
Oh, my god, Bill.
Where?
Um... four miles that way.
Two more miles.
Hurry, Bill!
Okay, people, this is it!
Stay back.
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment is at hand!
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment is at hand!
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment...
How far are we?
1.7 miles.
Which way do we go?
There's gonna be a dead end on your left,
So we have to go right.
Okay, guys, here we go.
Hold on a second!
T minus 2 minutes for launch.
Okay, well, we're not getting through this.
How far away is she?
Dad, she's just two blocks away.
Okay, we're going on foot, guys.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's the gps say?
She's that way!
One more block this way!
Just over a block!
Oh!
Dad, my phone!
Got to get my phone to find her!
Nelson, listen to me.
We'll find her.
Forget it, forget it!
We don't have time!
Let's go.
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!

Look!
What the hell?
That's my dad.
Julia!
Dad!
Dad!
Julia!
Daddy!
I got her!
Let's go!
Daddy!
Oh, Julia, are you okay?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
Oh, my god.
Oh, thank god.
Oh, baby.
Hi, baby.
Oh, I can't believe it!
We got her.
You all right?
Let me see you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Dad, this is Logan.
Hi, Logan.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's get to safety, guys.
Come on.
[Nelson]:
Dad, drive!
Dad, get us out of here!
The bridges are down, streets are blocked, the river's frozen.
What are we gonna do?
Daddy?
[Logan]:
Are you driving on the Hudson river?
Is it gonna hold?
[Nelson]:
It didn't last time.
[Julia]:
Last time?
What?
[Nelson]:
You see that?
Those are F-16s going in!
[Teri]:
What was that?
Sounds like something big just blew up.
[Teri]:
We're not gonna be able to outrun it!
What are we gonna do?
We cannot keep going on like this!
I know!
I'm trying to find a way off the river!
Any ideas?
How about that?
Okay, if we can make it.
Glacier appears to be breaking up.
Okay, everybody out!
Let's go!
Okay, go on through!
Come on through!
Let's go!
No, no, no, forget it.
Forget it.
Let's go upstairs!
Keep going!
Hurry!
Okay, get down.
Get down.
Honey.
Hear anything?
No.
Is it done?
Hold on.
Come on.
Come on up.
You okay?
Yeah.
Oh.
GO, BLUE TEAM.
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY SEEMS TO BE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY.
I'M HEADING NORTH ON THE SHELF TO COLLECT MORE DATA.
COPY.
BLUE TEAM, REPORTS SHOW
THE HEKLA VOLCANO IS HAVING IMMENSE SEISMIC READINGS.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.
COPY THAT.
BASE CAMP, WE'RE SEEING INTENSE MAGNA FLOW
RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE RANGE.
IF IT KEEPS INCREASING,
WE MAY HAVE TO EVACUATE THE AREA NOW,
ALL THE LOCAL AREAS.
BASE CAMP, IF THE WHOLE RANGE STARTS ERUPTING,
WE'RE LOOKING AT A WHOLE GLACIER DETACHING FROM THE SHELF.
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
CAN I REALLY TALK TO BASE ON THIS THING?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
TRY A LOWER BAND.
THERE YOU GO.
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
JUST CAN'T GET IT.
THERE'S TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE.
I'M GOING TO TAKE DOWN A PLANE WITH THIS THING.
BETTER NOT.
HEY, DID YOU PACK YOUR GORTEX?
HELLO?
JULIA?
JULIA?
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU HEARD ME A SECOND AGO.
MOM PACKED IT.
WELL, GOOD, I'M GLAD.
YOU KNOW, IT GETS COLD IN NEW YORK, JULIA.
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
SUMMIT CAMP, COME IN.
DAD, I THINK I JUST GOT 'EM.
OH, GREAT.
6SNL7, COME IN.
DAD, I'M GONNA MISS MY FLIGHT!
HOLD ON.
DAD, THIS IS MY TERMINAL.
DAD!
6SNL7, COME IN.
THIS IS SUMMIT CAMP.
GO AHEAD.
DIVYA?
HEY, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I'M BRINGING SOME NEW INSTRUMENTS NEXT WEEK.
BILL, HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE DATA WE SENT?
NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT IN THE OFFICE.
I'M DROPPING JULIA OFF AT THE AIRPORT.
WHY?
WHAT'S UP?
WE'RE EVACUATING.
THE REST OF THE TEAM IS GONE ALREADY.
I'M THE LAST MAN STANDING.
EVACUATING?
WHY?
DAD, I SHOULD JUST WALK FROM HERE.
HEKLA WENT BERSERK.
THERE'S A HUGE PRESSURE BUILDUP.
THE ENDURANCE READINGS ARE OFF THE CHART.
THE ENTIRE HEKLA LINE IS ERUPTING.
THERE IS PRESSURE BUILDING UP EVERYWHERE.
BILL, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
PRESSURE BUILDING UP WHERE?
AT WHAT SITE?
I'M TRYING.
GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE SEEING ACTIVITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE RANGE.
WAIT, AT ALL THE SITES?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, DIVYA.
I CHECKED WITH THE OTHER STATIONS.
NO ONE'S EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
I SENT YOU EVERYTHING WE GOT
BEFORE THE CENTERS MELTED DOWN, BILL.
LOOK AT THE DATA!
NO, I'M NOT AT THE OFFICE.
I'LL BE THERE IN AN HOUR.
PULL UP THE COMPUTER SIMULATION.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
DIVYA?
OKAY, I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL NOW.
NO NEED TO SAY GOODBYE OR ANYTHING.
REYKJANES RIDGE?
YEAH.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
MAGNA FLOW RATE?
F7.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK AROUND CHRISTMASTIME
UNLESS I DECIDE TO STAY IN NEW YORK FOREVER.
DIVYA, COME IN.
DIVYA, IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME,
I WILL LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I WILL CONTACT YOU
AS SOON AS I GET TO THE OFFICE.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
6SNL7, COME IN.
5-3-7-6-E-9.
6SNL7, DO YOU COPY?
SIR, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
IT'S FINE.
I'M JUST DROPPING MY DAUGHTER OFF.
WE'LL BE TWO MINUTES.
6SNL7, DO YOU READ?
SIR?
OH, MY GOD.
COME IN, 6SNL7.
DO YOU READ?
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
SIR?
HART, DO YOU READ ME?
YES, GO AHEAD, DIVYA.
I READ YOU.
GO AHEAD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
SIR, THIS IS A NO PARKING ZONE.
THIS IS LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY.
I NEED YOU TO MOVE YOUR--
THIS IS MASSIVE!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
EVERY SINGLE VOLCANO IS ERUPTING!
SAY AGAIN.
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
THE ENTIRE ICE SHELF IS FRACTURING!
IT'S 1,000 MILES LONG!
BILL, DO YOU READ ME?
SOMETHING ABOUT THE VOLCANO.
IS NOT MOVING.
DAD, WE NEED TO GO.
LOOK.
YEAH.
WHERE'S JULIA?
SHE LEFT, LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.
WHAT?
AH, CRAP.
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE, DAD?
NO, NO, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED HER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR SISTER.
MOM'S GONNA KILL YOU.
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.
DAD, WHAT IS DR. CHANDRA SAYING ABOUT THE GLACIER?
DID IT CALF?
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT IT SOUNDED A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT.
THAT WOULD BE SICK.
SICK, HUH?
100 %.
WHY DON'T YOU BRING UP THE SIMULATION AGAIN
ON THE PARAMETER SCREEN, OKAY?
OKAY, LET'S SEE.
OKAY, USING THESE NUMBERS,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
FOR THE ICE FLOW PROJECTION, OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ROY?
BILL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT IN THE FIELD.
I JUST SPOKE WITH DIVYA,
AND HE HAD SENT YOU SOME DATA.
DID YOU RECEIVE IT?
YEAH, THE HEKLA VOLCANO JUST ERUPTED.
NO, BUT IT SOUNDED MORE THAN THE HEKLA,
LIKE THE WHOLE RANGE WENT UP.
WE KNOW.
HART, GO HOME.
WE'VE GOT THIS.
I COULD BE PULLING MAPS OR CRUNCHING NUMBERS.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SEND ME HOME?
BILL, WE DON'T NEED YOU.
ROY, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR 15 YEARS.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?
BILL, I HAVE JUST PUT CYNTHIA AND MY KIDS
ON A PLANE TO MEXICO.
YOU DO THE SAME.
WE HAVE GOT CHUNKS OF ICE
FALLING ALL OVER CANADA.
IN 19 HOURS, THE BULK OF THE GLACIER
IS GOING TO HIT NORTH AMERICA.
BILL, GET YOUR FAMILY OUT NOW.
WHAT DID YOU GET?
IT WON'T LET ME INPUT THIS DATA.
OKAY.
WELL, LET'S OPEN UP A TERMINAL WINDOW
AND WE'LL ENTER SANDBOX MODE.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, IT'S A MODE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO ENTER IN VARIABLES THAT ARE THEORETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS WE GOT TO GET YOUR MOM.
WHY?
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU ON THE WAY.
HOLD ON.
EXCUSE ME, SENATOR.
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
BUT I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CYRUS
OVER AT AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES,
AND HE SAID THAT ALL THE FLIGHTS ARE GROUNDED
BECAUSE OF THE VOLCANIC ASH FLOW.
GET QUINCY IN DC AND ASK HIM
IF THEY'RE GONNA POSTPONE THE SUMMIT.
YES, SENATOR.
HEY.
YOUR DAUGHTER'S FLYING OUT TODAY.
YES.
STARTING COLLEGE.
NYU.
TERI, THESE VOLCANOES ARE IN GREENLAND.
JULIA'S FLYING INTO NEW YORK.
SHE'LL BE FINE.
I HOPE SO.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, SIR.
THANK YOU.
TERI?
TERI?
TERI?
BILL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
NO, NO.
JULIA IS FINE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
PLEASE DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS TALKING TO DIVYA ABOUT THE PETERMANN GLACIER.
DIVYA?
PETERMANN?
WHAT IS THAT?
HI, BILL.
HI, SENATOR.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT WITH JULIA?
EVERYTHING'S FINE WITH JULIA, SENATOR.
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
BUT YOU NEED TO LEAVE TOWN RIGHT NOW, SIR.
BILL!
BILL WAS JUST LEAVING, SENATOR.
SO SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
LOOK, THERE IS A HUGE GLACIER COMING OUR WAY,
AND IT'S COMING AT US REALLY, REALLY QUICK.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF TOWN!
LISTEN, I HAVE A SUMMIT MEETING.
NO, NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND.
MOM, MOM!
THIS IS TRUE!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF MAINE.
REALLY?
YOU'RE GONNA BRING OUR SON INTO ALL YOUR WEATHER--
IT'S TRUE!
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SO SORRY.
HI, JOSH.
HI.
HEY, BILL.
I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYBODY
ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE SUMMIT.
NOT EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE IS PICKING UP.
YOU'D BETTER BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
JOSH, GO HOME.
WHAT?
NO, DON'T GO HOME.
GET OUT OF MAINE.
GO AS FAR SOUTH AS YOU CAN!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
DON'T SCARE HIM LIKE THAT!
EAGLE CLIFF, FLIGHT DECK.
REQUESTING SAT-COM COORDINATES.
OVER.
HOLD FOR GPS.
GLACIER LOCATED.
58-42 NORTH, 39-02 WEST,
BEARING 210.
OVER.
COPY THAT.
EAGLE CLIFF FLIGHT DECK CLEAR.
FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0 CLEAR TO TAKE OFF.
ROGER, I'M GETTING A VISUAL NOW.
THIS IS FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0.
IT'S HEADING TOWARDS NEWFOUNDLAND.
WHY IS IT GETTING DARKER?
THE WEATHER'S CHANGING.
DAD, ARE YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON?
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
I NEED TO CALL JULIA.
CAN WE GO HOME FIRST?
I NEED TO GET MY LAPTOP.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF TOWN.
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
DON'T THEY HAVE WI-FI ON AIRPLANES?
MAYBE IF SHE WAS FLYING FIRST CLASS.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FLYING AT ALL TODAY.
NOT TODAY.
DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S GONNA BE LANDING SOON.
WE'LL GET HOLD OF HER.
IT'LL BE OKAY.
WHOA.
USE WORDS, NELSON.
I DON'T THINK I CAN.
WHAT?
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING BACK HOME.
WHY NOT?
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.
LOOK AT THE CLOUDS.
WHAT CAN DO THAT?
GLACIERS.
REALLY, REALLY FAST GLACIERS.
OKAY, SO WHERE WE GOING?
NEW YORK.
TAKE US ABOUT 7, 8 HOURS.
HEY.
HEY!
I MISSED YOU.
I MISSED YOU, TOO.
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG.
TRAFFIC WAS A MESS.
I KNOW.
THEY GROUNDED ALL THE FLIGHTS.
THEY DID?
DAMN.
MM-HMM.
GUESS WE'RE GONNA BE HERE A WHILE, HUH?
WELL, THAT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING.
OOH, I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
OH, CRAP.
I'M SORRY.
WHO'S THAT?
NO ONE.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE DORM AND FOOL AROUND.
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
JULIA, WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU AT YOUR DORM, OKAY, HONEY?
SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE DORM, JUST STAY THERE, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU THERE.
ALL RIGHT, BIG HUGS, AND LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU.
BYE.
ARE YOU SURE THAT NEW YORK IS SAFE?
BILL?
HOW STUPID.
WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE HER FLY AND MEET US DOWN IN FLORIDA?
SWEETHEART, EVERYTHING IS GROUNDED.
I SAY WE STAY ON PLAN
AND WE JUST MEET HER AT THE DORM.
FINE.
OH, MY GOSH!
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE OKAY.
DAD, I THINK IT'S COMING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT!
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS?
NO.
THE GLACIERS ARE MAKING IT SNOW IN MAINE?
IT'S SUMMER.
CAN YOU JUST GET US OUT OF MAINE NOW?
HOW BIG DO THESE GLACIERS HAVE TO BE TO DO THIS?
BILL?
CRAP.
DAD, DOES THIS SNOW MEAN THE GLACIER'S GETTING CLOSE?
BILL, IT HAS TO BECAUSE THE CLOUDS ARE LOOKING MASSIVE.
I BET THIS GLACIER IS ENORMOUS,
LIKE THE WHOLE SHELF.
YEAH.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO.
I GOT TO FIND A WAY AROUND THIS TRAFFIC.
NELSON, JUMP ON THE GPS AND FIND ME AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.
ON IT.
BILL, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW!
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE GLACIER IS CLOSE.
THOSE MILITARY PLANES?
F-16s.
NELSON, FOCUS.
GPS.
TARGET IS 400 MILES OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST
AND IS NOW IN RANGE.
SIR, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
I SEE NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
THERE IS NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, LOOK AGAIN.
HOLY SH--
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
DELTA BRAVO ONE, DO YOU READ ME?
DELTA BRAVO ONE?
ALPHA FOXTROT, THIS IS CONTROL.
FIRE SEQUENCE IN 3... 2... 1...
FIRE!
OH, MY GOD!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?
IS IT GONE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
I THINK WE OUTRAN IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BILL?
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE?
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST PULL OVER.
NO, NOT YET, NOT YET.
EVERYTHING IS GONE, ISN'T IT?
JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT, NELSON?
EVERYTHING.
GOD, MY FRIENDS.
I NEED TO GET ONLINE!
NO, NO.
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT, OKAY?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!
NO, THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT!
MOM, YOUR CELL PHONE.
IT'S JULIA.
JULIA?
JULIA!
MOM!
OH, MY GOD.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?
WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.
DAD'S HERE AND NELSON'S HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE DON'T KNOW.
THE NEWS IS SAYING THAT BANGOR JUST GOT DESTROYED.
TELL HER WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
MOM, CAN I JUST TALK TO HER?
TELL HER THAT WE'LL BE AT HER DORM
IN SIX HOURS FROM NOW.
WE'RE GONNA BE AT YOUR DORM IN SIX HOURS, OKAY?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
JULIA?
JULIA?
HELLO?
LET ME TALK TO HER.
JULIA, LISTEN.
IF THE WEATHER BREAKS, HEAD SOUTH TO FLORIDA
TO YOUR AUNT KISSY'S HOUSE.
THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU GO, THE SAFER IT IS.
JULIA?
HELLO?
JULIA?
HELLO?
SWEETHEART, IF YOU CAN...
MOM?
LOST IT.
DAD, I WANTED TO TALK TO HER.
SORRY, BUDDY.
WELL, WHAT?
MY PARENTS ARE COMING FOR ME.
I THINK THEY WANT US TO STAY AT THE DORM.
WELL, WE SHOULD GET GOING THEN.
YEAH.
IT'S GETTING COLD FAST.
COME ON!
EVACUATION IS MANDATORY
IN MOST NORTHEAST COASTAL TOWNS.
WE'VE BEEN INFORMED,
FOLLOWING AN ONSITE EVALUATION,
THE PRESIDENT WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE
WITH THE MOST CURRENT UPDATE.
THE MILITARY CURRENTLY HAS AWAC IN THE AIR
ASSESSING THE THREAT.
DROPPING OUT AT 400.
TARGET IS BREAKING UP,
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
SAY AGAIN, JOHNNY BRAVO.
TARGET IS SEPARATING INTO MULTIPLE SECTIONS
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT
HEADING SOUTH DOWN THE COAST.
WOW.
CLOUD COVER'S JUST SO THICK,
IT LOOKS LIKE NIGHT.
I'M GETTING NOTHING.
I'M TRYING TO CALL HER BACK.
LOOK, SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, OKAY?
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE OKAY.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF THE SENATOR.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYBODY.
DAD, YOU SAID THE PETERMANN GLACIER WAS HOW BIG?
LET'S SEE, THE LAST CALVING HAPPENED IN 2010.
THAT WAS ABOUT 100 SQUARE MILES,
WHICH IS ROUGHLY FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN,
AND THAT WAS ONLY 8 % OF THE GLACIER.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S THE WHOLE GLACIER.
WITH ENOUGH SPEED, WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT COULD DO?
WHAT?
DAD!
WHICH WAY'S YOUR ROOM?
THIS WAY.
COME ON.
KAREN!
OH, MY GOD, JULIA.
I CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYONE IN MAINE.
JUST TRY AGAIN, OKAY?
IT TOOK ME THREE TRIES.
KEEP TRYING.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
KEEP TRYING.
IS THERE A BASEMENT?
NO, THERE'D BE NO RECEPTION IN THE BASEMENT.
I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.
COME ON, JULIA!
NO, THAT'S A MISTAKE.
NO, JULIA, WE HAVE TO GO!
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HURRY!
PUT YOUR JACKET ON.
WE GOT TO GO.
BUT MY DAD SAID TO STAY HERE.
I KNOW.
CALL HIM AND TELL HIM,
BUT WE AREN'T STAYING HERE, JULIA!
MOM!
DAD!
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE!
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN WE--
I LOST THE SIGNAL.
YOU THINK THE MESSAGE WENT THROUGH?
I HOPE SO.
SO THEN WHAT NOW?
HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THE CITY?
EVERYTHING'S SHUT DOWN.
WE GET TO ONE OF THE BRIDGES AND GET ACROSS THE RIVER!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
JULIA, WHAT ABOUT THE SUBWAY?
THE SUBWAYS ARE SHUT DOWN, TOO.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIN, JULIA.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TUNNELS.
WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH ONE OF THOSE.
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'LL WORK?
WOULD YOU RATHER STAY UP HERE?
COME ON!
OH...
OH.
YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY, DAD.
YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE OKAY.
WE'LL WORK OUR WAY OUT.
COME ON.
NELSON'S OKAY.
WE'RE GOOD.
THE SUN IS BREAKING THROUGH.
COME ON.
EASY, EASY.
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST A CUT.
COME ON.
GET NELSON.
COME ON, SWEETIE.
NELSON?
YOU OKAY?
BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
BROKEN BONES?
NO.
ANYTHING?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, OKAY.
GOOD JOB.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE, DAD.
GOOD JOB.
OKAY, LET'S GET MOVING.
LET'S GO.
WE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.
KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CAR.
SEE IF THAT VAN WORKS.
OKAY, GUYS, COME ON.
COME ON.
SO COLD.
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.
OKAY, GUYS, GET IN.
GET IN, HONEY.
LOOK FOR SOME KEYS.
I'M GONNA CHECK THIS OUT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
IT'S SO COLD.
WHERE'S DAD GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.
HELLO?
HELLO?
WHERE'S DAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK, THOUGH, HONEY.
MOM, THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION.
OH, GOOD.
LET'S START IT.
COME ON.
TRY AGAIN.
YES!
OKAY, GOOD.
IT'S A MESS IN HERE.
SMELLS LIKE SHIT.
OH, GOOD.
YOU GOT IT RUNNING.
YEAH.
OKAY, BAD NEWS.
THERE'S A BIG PILEUP.
WE GOT TO FIND A WAY--
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I THINK IT'S MANURE OR SOMETHING.
IT SMELLS AWFUL.
MANURE?
LIKE FERTILIZER?
YEAH.
WHAT KIND?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HONEY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT.
EXCELLENT.
OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHERE'D HE GO?
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE DAD COMES BACK SOON.
OKAY, INSIDE.
GO.
OKAY, HEADS DOWN.
HEADS DOWN.
HERE WE GO.
HEADS DOWN.
OKAY, WHY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.
WHAT KIND OF SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, BILL?
THE KIND THAT GOES BOOM.
SEE, WHEN YOU TAKE AMMONIUM NITRATE
AND YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIESEL FUEL, YOU GET...
WHOA!
DAD, WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO DO THAT?
IN SCIENCE CLASS.
OH, GOD, BILL.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION, I THINK.
I DO.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION.
PULL OVER.
PULL OVER RIGHT NOW!
MOM GOT A RECEPTION?
YEAH.
WELL?
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
IT'S JULIA.
WHERE WE GOING TO GO?
MOM, DAD, WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
NELSON, GET ON THE SHORTWAVE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL--
SOMETHING BAD HAS HIT HER DORM.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PLAYING IT AGAIN.
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
WE'RE NOT SAFE--
SOMETHING'S HIT THE DORM REALLY BAD AND SHE'S TRYING TO GET OUT.
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
SHE'S SAYING SHE CANNOT GET OUT OF NEW YORK CITY.
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?
IT'S A SONIC BOOM.
10 BIRDS IN FORMATION.
THEY'RE GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER.
CAN THEY DO THAT?
CAN THEY BOMB A GLACIER, BILL?
YEAH, THEY COULD DO THAT,
BUT THEY'D NEED TO HIT IT WITH A NUCLEAR BOMB
TO STOP THIS THING.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THEY SAID BOSTON'S GONNA BE HIT NEXT
IF THEY DON'T STOP IT.
BOSTON?
WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
OSCAR CHARLIE AND DELTA X-RAY APPROACHING TARGET.
ROGER, OSCAR CHARLIE.
ORDERING NUCLEAR PAYLOAD ACTIVE.
NUKES ARE HOT, WAITING FOR COUNTDOWN.
MY SON WAS BORN IN BOSTON, SO LET'S MELT THIS ICE.
ROGER THAT.
FIRE ONE!
OSCAR CHARLIE, DO YOU HAVE A VISUAL?
CHECKING NOW.
COMMAND 483.
NUKES DEPLOYED,
BUT THEY HAVE NO VISUAL EFFECT.
WAITING ON NEXT COMMAND.
EVERYONE LOOKS SO SCARED.
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
LOOK, WE GOT THIS BIG EMPTY VAN,
ALL THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP.
I FIGURE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL OPEN UP A DOOR--
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WE NEED TO GET HER, AND SHE IS OUR PRIORITY.
SHE'S OUR TOP PRIORITY, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
I FIGURE WE CAN HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE
RIDE WITH US TO NEW YORK.
IT'LL TAKE TWO MINUTES--
NO!
TWO MINUTES?
YEAH, TWO MINUTES.
HONEY, WE JUST CAN'T LEAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
HONEY?
MOM, DAD...
HEAR THAT?
EVERYBODY OKAY?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
I THINK WE MADE IT.
LET'S KEEP GOING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
BOSTON'S BEEN HIT!
THE GLACIER'S LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM US!
IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!
IT'S TOO LATE.
WE HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS NOT TO COME.
ALL THE CIRCUITS ARE BUSY.
NO SURPRISE THERE.
KEEP IT ON.
WE'LL TRY AGAIN LATER.
WE GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
COME ON.
BABE, I KNOW WHERE WE ARE.
WE COULD TAKE A TUNNEL.
WE TRIED THEM ALL.
THEY'RE CLOSED!
TRUST ME!
GO, GO.
HURRY.
HURRY!
BE CAREFUL.
CAREFUL.
WE USED TO GO THIS WAY WHEN WE WERE, LIKE, 12.
JUST NEED TO FIND A LIGHT.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WE REALLY HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE?
YEAH.
IT'S SAFER THAN UP THERE.
OH, GOD.
WHAT IF MY PARENTS TRY TO MAKE IT TO NEW YORK?
THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOUR MESSAGE.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF--
THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE.
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIND SOME GAS SOON.
I CAN LOG ON AND FIND US A GAS STATION.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, HONEY.
POWER GRID IS DOWN, BUDDY.
THAT MEANS NO WI-FI, NO GAS STATIONS.
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
WE JUST NEED TO FIND HIM SOME FOOD
AND LET'S FIND SOME GAS.
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S JUST START LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.
DAD, LOOK!
YOU CAN SIPHON GAS.
GREAT IDEA.
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S START LOOKING FOR CARS,
HOPEFULLY FILLED WITH FOOD.
HANG IN THERE, NELSON.
WE'RE ALMOST IN NEW YORK, OKAY?
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN, BILL.
I THINK I SEE SOME CARS IN THE DISTANCE.
IT'S JUST SO CREEPY
WHEN IT GETS DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
HONEY, JUST GET WHAT WE NEED AND GET BACK.
BE CAREFUL.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S IN THERE.
JUST STAY THERE.
WHY?
JUST STAY THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.
I GOT THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO PEE.
OKAY.
I'M GLAD THAT WAS YOU AND NOT ME.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
IT'S WORKING.
THAT IS SOME STRONG STUFF.
WHEW!
HEY, WE'RE IN CONNECTICUT.
HONEY?
I'M NOT STOPPING.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.
HEY, NELSON, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO PULL UP ANYTHING ON THE GPS?
NOT REALLY.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT?
HAND 'EM OVER.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE BACK THERE, CHEF NELSON?
OH, MAN!
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU GUYS.
YEAH, SURE YOU WERE.
DINNER?
THANKS.
THANK YOU, HONEY.
NELSON, HOW MUCH LONGER TO NEW YORK?
ABOUT TWO HOURS.
YOU THINK SHE'S STILL AT THE DORM?
I'M SURE YOUR SISTER'S FINE.
SHE'S A SMART GIRL AND SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
IT'S THIS WAY.
YOU SURE WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN HERE IN 10 YEARS.
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN AND TRUST ME, OKAY?
IT'S THE ONLY WAY, JULIA.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING DEEPER, THOUGH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER IT IS, IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
COME ON.
WOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE.
COME ON.
LET'S KEEP MOVING.
DAD, I GOT A FREQUENCY.
GO HENRY. 11-41 AND 44th AND...
INTERSECTION.
10-4...
LB.
AJ4-LB.
TURN TO CHANNEL 3 FOR FURTHER DETAILS.
COPY THAT.
THANK YOU.
YOU OKAY?
DO YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE?
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE.
SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
WE'RE ALMOST TO NEW YORK,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN.
WE'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN, OKAY?
OH, CRAP.
STAY HERE.
ARE WE IN NEW YORK?
NOT YET, HONEY.
NOT YET.
HEY!
HEY!
IS YOUR CAR WORKING?
NO, IT'S OUT OF GAS.
OH, GAS, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BUT YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU'RE STUCK, BUT YOU'RE OKAY, RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
RIGHT.
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
NO REASON.
HEY, HEY!
ARE YOU ALONE?
HEY, ARE YOU ALONE?
'CAUSE I'M ALONE.
I'M HERE WITH MY FAMILY.
OH, THAT'S COOL, THAT'S COOL.
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY COLD OUT HERE, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOMEPLACE WARM.
YEAH, I'D SAY FIND YOURSELF A CAR AND STAY INSIDE.
YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO.
I'LL GET A CAR.
I'LL GO TO CALIFORNIA.
YOU KNOW, HEY, I'LL GO TO THE BEACH
AND THE PRETTY BLONDE WOMEN.
MAYBE HAVE TEQUILAS ON THE BEACH.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.
NICE MEETING YOU.
NO, NO, HEY, HEY, HEY!
I'M THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND I COULD GO TO CALIFORNIA TOGETHER.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK.
OH, YEAH, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK'S REALLY COLD,
AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO GO SOMEPLACE THAT'S WARM.
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU, OKAY?
YOU GOT THAT?
EXCEPT YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE ME.
AGAIN, YOU GO.
WE NEED TO GO TO CALIFORNIA.
JUST CALM DOWN.
I GOT MY FAMILY RIGHT THERE.
JUST CALM DOWN.
LOOK AT ME!
WE'RE GOING TO CALIFORNIA.
I GOT SOME MONEY.
THAT CAN HELP.
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
I GOT SOME FOOD IF YOU WANT SOME FOOD.
I DON'T WANT YOUR FOOD.
HEY, WHAT KIND OF FOOD YOU GOT?
I NEED TO GET INTO THE VAN.
YEAH, YEAH.
NO, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
NO, GO, GO, GO.
GET IN.
NELSON, GIVE ME A BAG OF CHIPS.

BILL, HEY, HEY.
YOUR NAME IS BILL.
BILL, HEY, I'M GARY.
I'M GARY MORGANSON.
HEY, GARY.
YEAH, HEY.
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING MAYBE
I NEED TO GET IN THE CAR.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK, REMEMBER?
HERE'S YOUR FOOD.
NO, NO, NO.
I'M THINKING THAT
I SHOULD GET IN THE CAR WITH YOU GUYS.
NO, NO, NO.
HEY!
HEY!
HEY!
BILL, COME ON.
I'M NOT A BAD GUY.
I HEAR YOU.
NO, NO, I'M A GOOD GUY.
I'M A GREAT GUY.
I JUST WANT TO GO SOMEPLACE WARM, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN--HEY, HEY, KID, KID, KID, KID!
LOCK THE DOORS, NELSON, LOCK THE DOORS!
DAD, DO SOMETHING!
BILL, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW!
I CAN'T WE'RE BLOCKED IN.
MY SISTER'S IN NEW YORK!
OPEN THE DOOR!
OPEN THE DOOR!
LOCK THE DOORS, NELSON.
LOCK THE DOORS!
YOU GUYS THINK I'M KIDDING?
CALM DOWN, MAN.
THINK I'M JOKING AROUND?
YOU'RE DEAD.

ALL OF YOU ARE FRIGGING DEAD!
YOU'RE DEAD!
OPEN THE DOOR, KID.
EVERYBODY OUT.
COME ON.
COME ON, TERI, OUT.
GET OUT, NELSON.

PLEASE.
OH, GOD!

NO!
THE ICE!
LET'S RUN!
WATCH OUT!
COME ON, GUYS.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
WE DID IT.
IT'S SNOWING AGAIN.
OKAY, LET'S GET ANOTHER VEHICLE.
LET'S TRY THIS WAY.
COME ON.
WHERE ARE WE?
IT'S THE LINCOLN TUNNEL.
WE CAN TAKE THIS ALL THE WAY TO NEW JERSEY.
AND HOW FAR IS THAT?
IT'S ABOUT A MILE.
COME ON.
COME ON.
DAD, I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP GOING.
GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
IF WE STOP, WE DIE.
LET'S JUST GO.
HONEY, IS THAT A HOUSE?
SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.
COME ON.
CAN WE GO?
YEP, LET'S TRY IT.
COME ON.
IT'S SO COLD.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW, GUYS.
IT'S SO COLD.
HELLO!
HELLO!
COME ON IN, GUYS.
SIT DOWN.
GET WARM.
HELLO?
I DIDN'T SEE A CAR OUT FRONT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY LEFT HERE PRETTY QUICKLY.
HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE IF YOU FIND SOME CLOTHES,
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME FOOD,
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
HELLO?
HELLO?
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU, JULIA.
HERE, HONEY, I FOUND THESE UPSTAIRS.
OH, GREAT.
HERE YOU GO.
SHOULD WE JUST LET HIM SLEEP?
NO, NO, NO.
WE GOT TO GET GOING.
IT MAY LOOK LIKE NIGHT,
BUT IT'S ONLY 3:00 p.m.
COME ON, WAKE UP, NELSON.
IT'S TIME TO GO.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE GOT TO DO IT ON FOOT.
GET GOING AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND ONE ON THE WAY.
HERE, HONEY.
SHH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HELLO?
WE'RE JUST HERE FOR SOME WARM CLOTHES.
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
THANK YOU!
WAIT!
WAIT!
MY DADDY'S HURT.
WESLEY, COME HERE.
OH, THANK GOD.
I THINK HE CAME THIS WAY.
OH.
I FOUND PEOPLE.
LISTEN TO ME.
DON'T YOU EVER LEAVE ME, OKAY?
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
CAN WE HELP?
YOU OKAY?
I WAS TRYING TO LOAD OUR TRUCK UP
AND THIS WHOLE THING FELL ON ME.
IT'S GOT MY LEG PINNED DOWN HERE.
OKAY, ON THE COUNT OF THREE, GUYS.
YOU READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE...
LET IT GO.
LET IT GO.
I THINK IF YOU LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP,
I CAN PROBABLY SHIMMY OUT.
OKAY, READY?
GOT IT?
OH, YEAH.
YOU GOT IT?
YOU CLEAR?
YEAH.
HERE.
GET UP.
DADDY, YOU'RE BLEEDING.
I'LL BE OKAY, SON.
MAN, THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME ALONG.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WE LOST OUR VAN AT THE RIVER
AND YOUR PLACE WAS THE FIRST PLACE WE CAME UPON.
I HAVE A VEST JUST LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THIS IS YOUR VEST.
WE KIND OF BROKE INTO YOUR PLACE.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE.
RELAX.
LOOK, ANYTHING YOU NEED HERE,
FEEL FREE TO HELP YOURSELF.
BESIDES, THIS PLACE ISN'T EVEN GONNA BE HERE IN A HOUR.
ARE WE GONNA FLY NOW?
NO, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE TRUCK, REMEMBER?
LOOK, YOU GUYS, WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM.
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
WHICH WAY YOU GUYS HEADED?
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HEAD WEST.
YEAH, WE'RE HEADED TO NEW YORK.
NEW YORK?
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE YOU WANT TO GO.
THIS ICEBERG IS CHEWING UP THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEW YORK.
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WELL, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
ME AND WESLEY, WE'RE GOING WEST.
HEY, IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?
MY DADDY CAN FLY.
SO CAN MINE.
DOES THIS STILL WORK?
SURE DOES.
ME AND WESLEY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN JAMAICA BY NOW,
BUT ONLY A FOOL WOULD GO UP IN THIS WEATHER.
GUYS, WE'RE ALL PACKED UP.
WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT.
YOU'RE STILL MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT I THINK I SHOULD GO
AND I'LL MEET YOU GUYS IN FLORIDA.
I AM NOT LEAVING YOU, EVER.
DAD, DAD, YOU NEED ME TO NAVIGATE.
OKAY.
GOOD LUCK.
YOU, TOO.
NELSON.
OKAY, NELSON, GET THIS OUT OF THE TARP.
LET'S GO.
BE CAREFUL.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE UNTIL THE GLACIER GETS HERE?
YOU HEAR THAT?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
NOT LONG.
LET'S GO.
COME ON!
GO!
THERE IT IS!
JERSEY!
COME ON, JULIA!
COME ON!
WE GOT TO GO!
ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
YOU READY?
ALL RIGHT, DAD!
WE CAN PROBABLY BE IN NEW YORK IN 30 MINUTES.
JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS BUMPY RIDE.
THESE CLOUDS DON'T LOOK NORMAL.
NOTHING LOOKS NORMAL.
IS THAT A TWISTER?
BILL, FLY US OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAN YOU FLY ABOVE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T WE HAVE A WEATHER DETECTION DEVICE?
I DON'T SEE ONE.
BILL, WE'RE FLYING RIGHT INTO THE THICK OF THAT.
HOLD ON!
DAD, YOU GOT TO GET US OUT OF HERE!
FLY HIGHER!
HIGHER, BILL!
HA HA!
AMAZING, DAD.
DAD!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
ARE THEY GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
EVERYTHING PROCEEDING PROPERLY, APPROACHING GLACIER.
ROGER THAT.
WE'RE AT THE OBSERVATION LOCATION.
WE'RE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 3-500 FEET
AND SIX MILES FROM LOCATION IMPACT.
WE NEED THE COORDINATES TO PLANT THE EXPLOSIONS.
ROGER THAT.
SENDING THEM NOW.
TEAMS FIVE AND SIX HAVE LANDED,
WAITING FOR SUPPLIES.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE DESCENDING NOW.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
AN HOUR TILL IMPACT.
AFFIRMATIVE?
63 MINUTES, MAJOR.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON, COME ON, GET IT, GO, GO!
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
HOW LONG UNTIL THE PAYLOAD DROP?
ARRIVING NOW.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON.
WE HAVE TO FIND SHELTER.
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS I'M IN JERSEY.
WE WILL.
COME ON.
CAN WE JUST STOP?
I'M TIRED.
NOT YET.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
HEY!
AAH!
AAH!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT!
HEY, LET HER GO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!
LET HIM GO!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT OR I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
STOP!
STOP!
NATIONAL GUARD!
STOP!
ARE YOU OKAY?
STOP!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING OUT HERE?
THIS CITY'S BEEN EVACUATED!
TO WHERE?
TO SHELTERS.
HELL, YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY I FOUND YOU.
I WAS ON MY LAST SWEEP.
LET'S GO!
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GLACIER?
ISN'T IT HEADED RIGHT FOR US?
NOT FOR LONG.
THERE'S A COMBINED TASKFORCE ON ITS WAY TO MEET IT.
SO YOU'VE DECLARED WAR ON A GLACIER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE LAST CHUNK OF THE GLACIER,
AND THEY'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ON IT.
NOW GET YOUR ASSES INSIDE BEFORE I HAVE YOU ARRESTED!
GO!
GO!
THAT'S THE LAST OF THE EXPLOSIVES, MAJOR.
GOOD, GOOD!
ALL EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED.
ROGER THAT.
THE CHARGES ARE IN PLACE!
TAKE US BACK HOME!
COPY THAT.
PREPARE FOR EXTRACTION.
ROGER THAT.
HEY, NELSON.
GRAB THE COMPUTER.
I WANT TO FIND OUT
IF WE CAN CONNECT TO A SATELLITE AT THIS ALTITUDE.
GOT IT.
SHOULD TAKE A SEC.
RECEPTION BLOWS UP HERE.
I GOT A SIGNAL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO CONNECT UP TO THE NOAA WEBSITE.
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT GLACIER IS RIGHT NOW.
GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE LOGIN?
LOGIN IS USERNAME JULIA,
PASSWORD, NELSON.
DAD, THAT'S LAME.
THAT IS SWEET.
LAME OR NOT, OPEN UP THE TRACKING PROGRAM.
NOW RUN THE SIMULATION WITH THE SAME COORDINATES,
BUT PUT IN OUR GPS LOCATION RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW FAR AWAY WE ARE FROM THAT GLACIER.
OKAY, IT'S 50 MILES BEHIND US.
IT'S MOVING AT 200 MILES AN HOUR.
WHAT?
HOW CAN A GLACIER MOVE AT 200 MILES PER HOUR?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE DOES EITHER.
CAN WE OUTRUN THAT?
ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT ON TIME?
LET'S FIND OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WE'RE ICING UP.
DOESN'T THIS MODEL HAVE DE-ICERS?
NO.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FLY LOW IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
WE'RE BURNING FUEL LIKE CRAZY.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK OUTSIDE
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY KIND OF PRIVATE AIRFIELD,
A CROP DUSTING OPERATION, ANYTHING.
YOU GUYS FINDING ANYTHING?
HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM NEW YORK?
CAN'T BE MORE THAN 100 MILES.
YOU GUYS SEEING ANYTHING?
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
THIS VISIBILITY SUCKS BALLS.
NELSON!
OKAY, GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE GONNA GO LOWER.
ANYTHING?
NOPE, NOTHING.
WE'RE STILL COLLECTING A LOT OF ICE.
I MAY HAVE TO PUT HER DOWN AT ANY TIME, GUYS.
HOW MUCH MORE ICE CAN THIS THING TAKE?
NOT A LOT.
THESE HEADWINDS ARE KILLING US.
WE COULD WALK THERE FASTER.
HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT?
ABOUT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.
I'M GONNA TRY TO LAND HER AT NEWARK OR LA GUARDIA.
WILL THEY ALLOW US TO LAND WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN?
WELL, I'LL JUST RADIO AHEAD
AND TELL THEM WE'RE AN EMERGENCY.
THEY HAVE TO LET US LAND.
WHAT IF THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HEAR US?
OH, CRAP!
WHAT?
WE JUST RAN OUT OF FUEL IN THE RIGHT FUEL TANK!
OKAY, GUYS, STRAP YOURSELVES IN.
GET READY.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING.
REALLY, BILL?
YES!
GET READY!
GOD, LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
WELL, AT LEAST WE GET FREE COOKIES.
YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND US?
I HOPE SO.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?
DAD'S IN NORTHERN EUROPE NEAR OSLO.
IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST HIT.
IT'S OKAY.
I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU.
OKAY, YOU GUYS.
WE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LAND,
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO NEWARK.
WE'RE ENTERING INTO THE NEW YORK AIR CORRIDOR NOW.
I'M GONNA GET ON THE RADIO
AND SEE IF ANYBODY'S THERE LISTENING.
GIVE ME THE RADIO THERE, NELSON.
NEWARK TOWER, THIS IS CESSNA...
WHERE'S THE FLIGHT NUMBER?
GIVE ME THE FLIGHT NUMBER.
THIS IS CESSNA NUMBER NOVEMBER NINER, NINER, 7-2-5.
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
DO YOU COPY?
CAN THEY EVEN HEAR US?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND A HOLE AND SLIP INTO IT.
BUCKLE UP, GUYS.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE GROUND
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, SO HOLD ON.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK AROUND
TO SEE IF YOU CAN SEE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT
THAT MIGHT BE LANDING WITHOUT TOWER PERMISSION, OKAY?
BRACE YOURSELVES!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH?
OKAY.
WE'RE DOWN.
OKAY, OKAY.
LET'S GET OUT, GUYS.
COME ON.
COME ON OUT.
COME ON, GUYS.
HERE WE GO.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WELL, I GUESS WE GOT OUT JUST IN TIME.
HEY, GUYS, LOOK.
IT'S NEW YORK.
WE DID IT!
ALMOST THERE.
YEAH.
DID YOU CRASH THAT ONE EIGHTY?
YEAH.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I GOT ALL THE INSURANCE INFORMATION IF YOU NEED IT.
IF A CRASHED CESSNA WAS ALL WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT,
I'D CALL IT A GOOD DAY.
COME WITH ME.
LET'S GET YOU INTO SOMEPLACE SAFE.
COLONEL SINOR, THIS IS COMMAND.
WE ARE LESS THAN 30 SECONDS FROM DETONATION.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE ALL CLEAR AND STANDING BY.
GIVE ME A LONG COUNT, CAPTAIN.
FIRE!
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
WERE YOU GUYS HEADED INTO MANHATTAN?
YEAH, BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR DAUGHTER.
I'M SORRY.
NO ONE'S GETTING IN AND OUT OF NEW YORK ALIVE.
JUST STAY HERE.
THE NATIONAL GUARD'S GONNA BE HERE TO GET YOU.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT--
OH!
OH!
COME ON, GET BACK!
GET BACK!
WE JUST GOT TO STAY AWAY FROM TALL BUILDINGS
WITH LOTS OF GLASS, GOT IT?
DAD, WE'RE GOING TO MANHATTAN.
POINT TAKEN.
SO HOW WE GONNA GET THERE?
WE GOT TO GET OURSELVES ANOTHER CAR
AND THEN JUST DRIVE INTO THE CITY.
AND GO WHERE?
TO THE DORM.
THE DORM?
SHE'S NOT AT THE DORM AND YOU KNOW THAT.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE SHE GOT OUR MESSAGE.
WHAT, TO GO TO FLORIDA?
LOOK, SHE MAY NOT BE IN NEW YORK,
BUT WE HAVE START THERE.
FROM THERE, MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
SOME SORT OF CLUE WHERE SHE--
ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE?
HEY, GUYS!
ARE WE GOING OR WHAT?
WERE THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.
LET'S JUST GO.
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET HOLD OF HER AGAIN.
IF WE'RE IN JERSEY, HOW FAR IS NEW YORK?
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER.
WE'RE COMING UP TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.
NO SIGNAL.
IT JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY NOW.
IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH.
WE JUST NEED TO GET UNDER THE GW.
I'LL TRY TO GET THE GPS RUNNING.
IS EVERYONE TRYING TO GET TO NEW YORK?
LOOK AT THAT MESS.
NELSON, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO THE BRIDGE.
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN YOUR CAR AROUND.
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH HERE.
WE HAVE TO GET TO MANHATTAN.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE'S GOING OVER THERE.
NO, OUR DAUGHTER IS THERE, AND WE NEED TO PICK HER UP.
I DON'T CARE IF THE POPE'S OVER THERE.
NO ONE'S GOING IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER SOON ANYWAY.
PLEASE JUST LET US GO.
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.
WASHINGTON BRIDGE, IT'S OUT.
WOW!
THE AIR FORCE IS COMING IN FOR THEIR LAST AIR STRIKE.
LET'S HOPE THAT DOES IT,
OR MAYBE NONE OF US WILL GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW, BILL?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THINKING SOMETHING.
WHAT?
OH, IT'S JUST THAT
REMEMBER WHEN THE KIDS WERE REALLY, REALLY YOUNG
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE COULD PUT
SOME SORT OF TRACKING DEVICE ON THEM,
WE'D ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE INVENTED THAT DEVICE.
DAMN IT!
WAIT, WAIT, GUYS!
WE DO HAVE A TRACKING DEVICE!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, NELSON?
OH, OF COURSE!
OF COURSE WHAT?
EVEN IF WE CAN'T TALK TO HER ON HER PHONE,
WE CAN TRACK HER PHONE.
REALLY?
WE CAN DO THAT?
YES.
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?
DON'T ASK.
I GOT IT!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
NEW JERSEY?
SHE'S HERE!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
OH, MY GOD, BILL.
WHERE?
UM...
FOUR MILES THAT WAY.
TWO MORE MILES.
HURRY, BILL!
OKAY, PEOPLE, THIS IS IT!
STAY BACK.
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT--
HOW FAR ARE WE?
1.7 MILES.
WHICH WAY DO WE GO?
THERE'S GONNA BE A DEAD END ON YOUR LEFT,
SO WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT.
OKAY, GUYS, HERE WE GO.
HOLD ON A SECOND!
T MINUS 2 MINUTES FOR LAUNCH.
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH THIS.
HOW FAR AWAY IS SHE?
DAD, SHE'S JUST TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
OKAY, WE'RE GOING ON FOOT, GUYS.
COME ON.
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S THE GPS SAY?
SHE'S THAT WAY!
ONE MORE BLOCK THIS WAY!
JUST OVER A BLOCK!
OH!
DAD, MY PHONE!
GOT TO GET MY PHONE TO FIND HER!
NELSON, LISTEN TO ME.
WE'LL FIND HER.
FORGET IT, FORGET IT!
WE DON'T HAVE TIME!
LET'S GO.
JULIA!
JULIA!

DADDY!
OH, JULIA, ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M FINE.
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, MY GOD.
OH, THANK GOD.
OH, BABY.
HI, BABY.
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
WE GOT HER.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET ME SEE YOU.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
DAD, THIS IS LOGAN.
HI, LOGAN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GET TO SAFETY, GUYS.
COME ON.
DAD, DRIVE!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
THE BRIDGES ARE DOWN, STREETS ARE BLOCKED, THE RIVER'S FROZEN.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
DADDY?
ARE YOU DRIVING ON THE HUDSON RIVER?
IS IT GONNA HOLD?
IT DIDN'T LAST TIME.
LAST TIME?
WHAT?
YOU SEE THAT?
THOSE ARE F-16s GOING IN!
WHAT WAS THAT?
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING BIG JUST BLEW UP.
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE CANNOT KEEP GOING ON LIKE THIS!
I KNOW!
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY OFF THE RIVER!
ANY IDEAS?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
OKAY, IF WE CAN MAKE IT.
GLACIER APPEARS TO BE BREAKING UP.
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT!
LET'S GO!
OKAY, GO ON THROUGH!
COME ON THROUGH!
LET'S GO!
NO, NO, NO, FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS!
KEEP GOING!
HURRY!
OKAY, GET DOWN.
GET DOWN.
HONEY.
HEAR ANYTHING?
NO.
IS IT DONE?
HOLD ON.
COME ON.
COME ON UP.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
OH.
Blue team to base camp.
Go, blue team.
Are you getting this?
The seismic activity seems to be increasing exponentially.
I'm heading north on the shelf to collect more data.
Copy.
Blue team, reports show the hekla volcano is having immense seismic readings.
Proceed with caution.
Copy that.
Base camp, we're seeing intense magna flow running up and down the range.
If it keeps increasing, we may have to evacuate the area now, all the local areas.
Base camp, if the whole range starts erupting, we're looking at a whole glacia detaching from the shelf.
[horns honking]
this is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Can I really talk to base on this thing?
Oh, absolutely.
I talk to them all the time.
This is 6snl7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Try a lower band.
There you go.
This is 6snl7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6snl7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
[sighs] just can't get it.
There's too much interference.
I'm going to take down a plane with this thing.
Better not.
Hey, did you pack your gortex?
Hello?
Julia?
Julia?
Unbelievable.
You heard me a second ago.
Mom packed it.
Well, good, I'm glad.
You know, it gets cold in new york, julia.
This is 6snl7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6snl7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Summit camp, come in.
Dad, I think I just got 'em.
Oh, great.
6snl7, come in.
Dad, I'm gonna miss my flight!
Hold on.
Dad, this is my terminal.
Dad!
6snl7, come in.
This is summit camp.
Go ahead.
Divya?
Hey, I wanted to let you know that I'm bringing some new instruments next week.
Bill, have you looked at the data we sent?
No, no, no.
I'm not in the office.
I'm dropping julia off at the airport.
Why?
What's up?
We're evacuating.
The rest of the team is gone already.
I'm the last man standing.
Evacuating?
Why?
Dad, I should just walk from here.
Hekla went berserk.
There's a huge pressure buildup.
The endurance readings are off the chart.
The entire hekla line is erupting.
There is pressure building up everywhere.
Bill, I've never seen anything like this.
Pressure building up where?
At what site?
I'm trying.
Guys, hold on.
We're seeing activity across the entire range.
Wait, at all the sites?
That doesn't make any sense, divya.
I checked with the other stations.
No one's ever seen anything like this.
I sent you everything we got before the centers melted down, bill.
Look at the data!
No, I'm not at the office.
I'll be there in an hour.
Pull up the computer simulation.
Divya, can you read me?
Divya?
[horns honking] okay, I'm going back to school now.
No need to say goodbye or anything.
Reykjanes ridge?
Yeah.
Divya, are you there?
Magna flow rate?
f7.
Divya, can you read me?
Right, I'll be back around christmastime unless I decide to stay in new york forever.
Divya, come in.
Divya, if you can still hear me,
I will look at the data and I will contact you as soon as I get to the office.
Divya, are you there?
6snl7, come in.
5-3-7-6-e-9.
6snl7, do you copy?
Sir, you're going to need to move your car.
It's fine.
I'm just dropping my daughter off.
We'll be two minutes.
6snl7, do you read?
Sir?
Oh, my god.
Come in, 6snl7.
Do you read?
Sir, you're gonna have to move your car.
Sir?
Hart, do you read me?
Yes, go ahead, divya.
I read you.
Go ahead.
I can't believe what's happening!
The entire range is on fire!
Sir, this is a no parking zone.
This is loading and unloading only.
I need you to move your--
This is massive!
What's happening?
The entire range is on fire!
Every single volcano is erupting!
Say again.
I couldn't understand.
The entire ice shelf is fracturing!
It's 1,000 miles long!
Bill, do you read me?
[alarm beeps]
[static] something about the volcano.
Is not moving.
Dad, we need to go.
Look.
Yeah.
Where's julia?
She left, like, two minutes ago.
What?
Ah, crap.
You want me to drive, dad?
No, no, I'm fine, i'm fine.
I just can't belie ve I missed her.
I can't believe I didn't say goodbye to your sister.
Mom's gonna kill you.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Dad, what is Dr. Chandra saying about the glacier?
Did it calf?
Well, it's possible, but it sounded a lot bigger than that.
That would be sick.
Sick, huh?
100%.
Why don't you bring up the simulation again on the parameter screen, okay?
Okay, let's see.
Okay, using these numbers, see what you can come up with for the ice flow projection, okay?
I'll be right back.
Roy?
Bill?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out in the field.
I just spoke with divya, and he had sent you some data.
Did you receive it?
Yeah, the hekla volcano just erupted.
No, but it sounded more than the hekla, like the whole range went up.
We know.
Hart, go home.
We've got this.
I could be pulling maps or crunching numbers.
Why are you trying to send me home?
Bill, we don't need you.
Roy, look, we've been friends for 15 years.
What the hell's going on here?
Bill, I have just put cynthia and my kids on a plane to mexico.
You do the same.
We have got chunks of ice falling all over canada.
In 19 hours, the bulk of the glacier is going to hit north america.
Bill, get your family out now.
What did you get?
It won't let me input this data.
Okay.
Well, let's open up a terminal window and we'll enter sandbox mode.
What's that?
Well, it's a mode that allows you to enter in variables that are theoretically impossible.
What does that mean?
It means we got to get your mom.
Why?
Right now.
I'll tell y ou on the way.
Hold on.
Excuse me, senator.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I just got off the phone with cyrus over at air traffic services, and he said that all the flights are grounded because of the volcanic ash flow.
Get quincy in dc and ask him if they're gonna postpone the summit.
Yes, senator.
Hey.
Your daughter's flying out today.
Yes.
Starting college.
Nyu.
Teri, these volcanoes are in greenland.
Julia's flying into new york.
She'll be fine.
I hope so.
I'm sure you're right, sir.
Thank you.
Teri?
Teri?
Teri?
Bill, what are you doing here?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to julia?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to julia?
No, no.
Julia is fine.
Everything's fine.
Okay, thank you.
Please don't scare me like that.
What are you doing here?
I was talking to divya about the petermann glacier.
Divya?
Petermann?
What is that?
Hi, bill.
Hi, senator.
Is everything all right with julia?
Everything's fine with julia, senator.
Sorry to disturb you.
But you need to leave town right now, sir.
Bill!
Bill was just leaving, senator.
So sorry to disturb you.
Look, there is a huge glacier coming our way, and it's coming at us really, really quick.
We got to get out of town!
Listen, I have a summit meeting.
No, no, no.
I understand.
Mom, mom!
This is true!
We have to get out of maine.
Really?
You're gonna bring our son into all your weather--
It's true!
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.
Hi, josh.
Hi.
Hey, bill.
I can't seem to get anybody on the phone about the summit.
Not even the white house is picking up.
You'd better be right about this.
Josh, go home.
What?
No, don't go home.
Get out of maine.
Go as far south as you can!
What's going on?
Teri: don't scare him like that!
Eagle cliff, flight deck.
Requesting sat-com coordinates.
Over.
Hold for gps.
Glacier located.
58-42 north, 39-02 west, bearing 210.
Over.
Copy that.
Eagle cliff flight deck clear.
Foxtrot, whiskey, 8-7-0 clear to take off.
Roger, I'm getting a visual now.
This is foxtrot, whiskey, 8-7-0.
It's heading towards newfoundland.
Why is it getting darker?
The weather's changing.
Dad, are your headlights on?
Give me your phone.
I need to call julia.
Can we go home first?
I need to get my laptop.
We have to get out of town.
[telephone ringing] she's not picking up.
I don't understand this.
Don't they have wi-fi on airplanes?
Maybe if she was flying first class.
She shouldn't have even been flying at all today.
Not today.
Don't worry.
She's gonna be landing soon.
We'll get hold of her.
It'll be okay.
Whoa.
Use words, nelson.
I don't think I can.
What?
Well, we're not going back home.
Why not?
Don't have enough time .
Look at the clouds.
What can do that?
Glaciers.
Really, really fast glaciers.
Okay, so where we going?
New york.
Take us about 7, 8 hours.
Hey.
Hey!
[laughs]
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Sorry it took me so long.
Traffic was a mess.
I know.
They grounded all the flights.
They did?
Damn.
Mm-hmm.
Guess we're gonna be here a while, huh?
Well, that's not such a bad thing.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
[cell phone buzzes] oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
Who's that?
No one.
Let's go back to the dorm and fool around.
All right.
Sounds good to me.
Julia, we're on our way to new york.
We're gonna meet you at your dorm, okay, honey?
So when you get to the dorm, just stay there, all right?
We're gonna meet you there.
All right, big hugs, and love you.
Love you, love you, love you.
Bye.
Are you sure that new york is safe?
Bill?
How stupid.
Why don't we just have her fly and meet us down in florida?
Sweetheart, everything is grounded.
I say we stay on plan and we just meet her at the dorm.
Fine.
Oh, my gosh!
It's okay, it's okay.
We're okay.
Dad, I think it's coming faster than we thought!
Have you ever seen this?
no.
The glaciers are making it snow in maine?
It's summer.
Can you just get us out of maine now?
How big do these glaciers have to be to do this?
Bill?
[horns honking]
crap.
e?
Dad, does this snow mean the glacier's getting clos bill, it has to because the clouds are looking massive.
I bet this glacier is enormous, like the whole shelf.
Yeah.
Okay, here's what we got to do.
I got to find a way around this traffic.
Nelson, jump on the gps and find me an alternate route.
On it.
Bill, get us out of here now!
We don't know if the glacier is close.
Those military planes?
F-16s.
Nelson, focus.
Gps.
Target is 400 miles off the northeast coast and is now in range.
Sir, I don't see anything.
Delta bravo one, target is in front of you.
Negative, alpha foxtrot.
I see nothing.
Delta bravo one, target is in front of you.
Negative, alpha foxtrot.
There is nothing.
Delta bravo one, look again.
Holy sh--
Pull up!
Pull up!
Pull up!
Delta bravo one, do you read me?
Delta bravo one?
Alpha foxtrot, this is control.
Fire sequence in 3...2... 1...fire!
Oh, my god!
Dad, get us out of here!
Is everybody okay?
Is it gone?
I don't know.
I don't see anything.
I think we outran it.
What do you think, bill?
Do you think it's gone?
I just don't know.
Maybe we should just pull over.
No, not yet, not yet.
Everything is gone, isn't it?
Just don't even think about it, all right, nelson?
Everything.
God, my friends.
I need to get online!
No, no.
You need to focus on what's important, okay?
This is important!
No, this is not important!
[cell phone rings] mom, your cell phone.
It's julia.
Julia?
Julia!
Mom!
Oh, my god.
Is everyone okay?
We're fine.
We're fine.
Dad's here and nelson's here.
Julia:
what happened?
We don't know.
The news is saying that bangor just got destroyed.
Tell her we're coming to new york.
We're coming to new york.
Nelson: mom, can I just talk to her?
rm Tell her that we'll be at her do in six hours from now.
We're gonna be at your dorm in six hours, okay?
Can you hear me?
Julia?
Julia?
[static] hello?
Let me talk to her.
Julia, listen.
If the weather breaks, head south to florida to your aunt kissy's house.
The further south you go, the safer it is.
Julia?
Hello?
Julia?
Hello?
Sweetheart, if you can...[breaking up] mom?
Lost it.
Dad, I wanted to talk to her.
Sorry, buddy.
Well, what?
My parents are coming for me.
I think they want us to stay at the dorm.
Well, we should get going then.
Yeah.
.
It's getting cold fast come on!
Announcer:
evacuation is mandatory in most northeast coastal towns.
We've been informed, following an onsite evaluation, the president will hold a press conference with the most current update.
The military currently has awac in the air assessing the threat.
Dropping out at 400.
Target is breaking up, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference.
Say again, johnny bravo.
Target is separating into multiple sections and there's still a lot heading south down the coast.
Wow.
Cloud cover's just so thick, it looks like night.
I'm getting nothing.
I'm trying to call her back.
[busy signal] look, she's gonna be okay, okay?
y.
We're gonna be oka we're all gonna be okay.
[busy signal] can't get hold of the senator.
Can't get hold of anybody.
[busy signal] dad, you said the petermann glacier was how big?
Let's see, the last calving happened in 2010.
That was about 100 square miles, which is roughly four times the size of manhattan, and that was only 8% of the glacier.
.
This sounds like it's the whole glacier with enough speed, who knows how much damage it could do?
What?
Dad!
[shouting and screaming] which way's your room?
This way.
Come on.
Karen!
Oh, my god, julia.
I can't get hold of anyone in maine.
Just try again, okay?
It took me three tries.
Keep trying.
Right, right.
Keep trying.
[thunder]
is there a basement?
No, there'd be no receptio n in the basement.
I'm gonna keep trying.
Come on, julia!
No, that's a mistake.
No, julia, we have to go!
[groaning and creaking] what was that?
I don't know.
Hurry!
Put your jacket on.
We got to go.
But my dad said to stay here.
I know.
Call him and tell him, but we aren't staying here, julia!
.
Mom!
Dad!
We're not staying here the dorms aren't safe!
I'll give you a call when we--
I lost the signal.
You think the message went through?
I hope so.
So then what now?
How do we get out of the city?
Everything's shut down.
We get to one of the bridges and get across the river!
Wait, wait, wait!
Julia, what about the subway?
The subways are shut down, too.
I'm not talking about the train, julia.
I'm talking about the tunnels.
We can make it through one of those.
?
You really think that'll work would you rather stay up here?
Come on!
Oh...oh.
You okay?
I'm okay, dad.
Yeah, yeah.
We're okay.
.
We'll work our way out come on.
Nelson's okay.
We're good.
The sun is breaking through.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
You okay?
You all right?
You're bleeding.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's just a cut.
Come on.
Get nelson.
Come on, sweetie.
Nelson?
You okay?
Baby, you all right?
Okay.
Broken bones?
no.
Anything?
Okay.
All right, guys, okay.
Good job.
I love you so much.
It's gonna be all right.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, dad.
Good job.
Okay, let's get moving.
Let's go.
We got to get away from the car.
Keep going.
Come on.
We need to find another car.
See if that van works.
Okay, guys, come on.
[cough] come on.
Nelson: so cold.
There's no one here.
Okay, guys, get in.
Get in, honey.
Look for some keys.
I'm gonna check this out.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
Where's dad going?
I don't know.
He'll be back.
Give me your hands.
Hello?
Hello?
Where's dad?
I don't know.
He'll be back, though, honey.
Mom, the keys are in the ignition.
Oh, good.
.
Let's start it [engine won't start] come on.
Try again.
[engine starts] yes!
Okay, good.
e.
It's a mess in her smells like shit.
Oh, good.
You got it running.
Yeah.
Okay, bad news.
There's a big pileup.
We got to find a way-- [sniffing] what's that smell?
I think it's manure or something.
It smells awful.
Manure?
Like fertilizer?
Yeah.
What kind?
I don't know.
What are you doing, honey?
Just a little science project.
Excellent.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Where'd he go?
[crash] what was that?
I don't know.
I hope dad comes back soon.
Okay, inside.
Go.
Okay, heads down.
Heads down.
Here we go.
Heads down.
Okay, why?
Just a little science experiment.
What kind of science experiment, bill?
The kind that goes boom.
See, when you take ammonium nitrate and you had a little bit of diesel fuel, you get...
Whoa!
Dad, where'd you learn to do that?
In science class.
[phone beeps] oh, god, bill.
I have phone reception, I think.
I do.
I have phone reception.
Pull over.
Pull over right now!
Mom got a reception?
Yeah.
Well?
Mom, dad, it's julia.
It's julia.
Where we going to go?
Mom, dad, we're not staying here.
Nelson, get on the shortwave.
The dorms aren't safe.
I'll give you a call--
Something bad has hit her dorm.
What happened?
I don't know.
I'm playing it again.
Mom, dad, it's julia.
We're not safe-- t.
Something's hit the dorm reall bad and she's trying to get ou we're not staying here.
The dorms aren't safe.
She's saying she cannot get out of new york city.
[explosion] what the heck was that?
It's a sonic boom.
10 birds in formation.
They're gonna go bomb the glacier.
Can they do that?
Can they bomb a glacier, bill?
Yeah, they could do that, but they'd need to hit it with a nuclear bomb to stop this thing.
g.
That's what they're doin they said boston's gonna be hit next if they don't stop it.
Boston?
We have got to get to new york city right now.
We got to get out of here.
Oscar charlie and delta x-ray approaching target.
Roger, oscar charlie.
Ordering nuclear payload active.
Nukes are hot, waiting for countdown.
My son was born in boston, so let's melt this ice.
Roger that.
Fire one!
Oscar charlie, do you have a visual?
Checking now.
Command 483.
Nukes deployed, but they have no visual effect.
Waiting on next command.
Everyone looks so scared.
Why are we stopping?
Look, we got this big empty van, all these people need help.
I figure, you know, we'll open up a door--
Our daughter's in new york.
We need to get her, and she is our priority.
She's our top priority , and we're on our way to new york.
I figure we can have a couple people ride with us to new york.
-- It'll take two minutes no!
Two minutes?
Yeah, two minutes.
Honey, we just can't leave people out there.
Honey?
Mom, dad...
Hear that?
Everybody okay?
I don't hear anything.
I think we made it.
Let's keep going.
What happened?
Boston's been hit!
The glacier's less than an hour from us!
It's headed right for us!
It's too late.
We have to tell my parents not to come.
[telephone ringing] all the circuits are busy.
No surprise there.
Keep it on.
We'll try again later.
We got to keep moving.
Come on.
Babe, I know where we are.
We could take a tunnel.
We tried them all.
They're closed!
Trust me!
Go, go.
Hurry.
Hurry!
Be careful.
Careful.
We used to go this way when we were, like, 12.
Just need to find a light.
You okay?
Yeah.
We really have to go down there?
Yeah.
It's safer than up there.
Oh, god.
What if my parents try to make it to new york?
They're going to get your message.
Yeah, but what if-- e.
They'll get the messag
hey, guys, we're gonna need to find some gas soon.
I can log on and find us a gas station.
I don't think that's gonna happen, honey.
Power grid is down, buddy.
That means no wi-fi, no gas stations.
I'm really hungry.
We just need to find him some food and let's find some gas.
All right?
Let's just start looking for something.
Dad, look!
You can siphon gas.
Great idea.
Okay, guys, let's star t looking for cars, hopefully filled with food.
Hang in there, nelson.
We're almost in new york, okay?
Slow down, slow down, bill.
I think I see some cars in the distance.
y Nelson: it's just so creep when it gets dark in the middle of the day.
Honey, just get what we need and get back.
Be careful.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if anyone's in there.
Just stay there.
Why?
Just stay there.
All right.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
I can do this.
I got this.
All right.
I'm gonna go pee.
Okay.
[coughs] i'm glad that was you and not me.
Yeah, me, too.
It's working.
That is some strong stuff.
Whew!
Hey, we're in connecticut.
Honey?
I'm not stopping.
It's pitch black.
Hey, nelson, have you been able to pull up anything on the gps?
Not really.
Are you kidding me?
What?
Hand 'em over.
Unbelievable.
You got anything else back there, chef nelson?
Oh, man!
I was gonna tell you guys.
Yeah, sure you were.
Dinner?
Thanks.
Thank you, honey.
Nelson, how much longer to new york?
About two hours.
You think she's still at the dorm?
I'm sure your sister's fine.
She's a smart girl and she can take care of herself.
It's this way.
You sure we're going the right way?
I mean, you haven't been down here in 10 years.
You have to calm down and trust me, okay?
It's the only way, julia.
It feels like we're going deeper, though.
[creaking] what was that?
Oh, god, I don't know.
Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good.
Come on.
[creaking and groaning] wow.
It sounds like it's getting worse.
Come on.
Let's keep moving.
Nelson:
dad, I got a frequency.
[radio broadcast breaking up] go henry. 11-41 and 44th and...intersection.
[transmission breaking up] 10-4...

Aj4-lb.
Turn to channel 3 for further details.
Copy that.
Thank you.
You okay?
Do you want me to drive?
You know, I didn't say goodbye.
She got out of the car and I didn't even know it.
We're almost to new york, and you're gonna get to see her again.
We're gonna get to see her again, okay?
Oh, crap.
Stay here.
Are we in new york?
Not yet, honey.
Not yet.
Hey!
Hey!

I'm here with my family.
Oh, that's cool, that's cool.

Yeah, yeah, no, no.
I'll get a car.

You know, hey, i'll go to the beach and the pretty blonde women.
Maybe have tequilas on the beach.

No, we're going to new york.
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, yeah.

Daddy, you're bleedin i'll be okay, son.

Oh, yeah.
Actually, this is your vest.
We kind of broke into your place.
We didn't know anyone was here.
Relax.
Look, anything you need here, feel free to help yourself.

me and wesley, we're going west.
hey, is this what I think it is?
my daddy can fly.

guys, we're all packed up.
We're gonna head out.
you're still more than welcome to join us.
I know we talked about this, but I think I should go and I'll meet you guys in florida.

[laughs] we can probably be in new york in 30 minutes.
just sit back and enjoy this bumpy ride.
these clouds don't look normal.
teri: nothing looks normal.
is that a twister?
bill, fly us out of here.
what's wrong?
can you fly above it?
I don't know.
don't we have a weather detection device?
I don't see one.
bill, we're flying right into the thick of that.
hold on!
dad, you got to get us out of here!
fly higher!
Higher, bill!
ha ha!
amazing, dad.
dad!
Two o'clock!
Look!
are they gonna go bomb the glacier?
I have no idea.
pilot: everything proceeding properly, approaching glacier.
roger that.
We're at the observation location.
we're at an altitude of 3-500 feet and six miles from location impact.
we need the coordinates to plant the explosions.
roger that.
Sending them now.
teams five and six have landed, waiting for supplies.
roger that.
We are descending now.
lieutenant colonel sinor, an hour till impact.
Affirmative?
63 minutes, major.
roger that.
come on, come on, get it, go, go!
lieutenant colonel sinor, how long until the payload drop?
arriving now.
roger that.
come on.
We have to find shelter.
I have to tell my parents i'm in jersey.

I'm tired.

We have to keep going.

what the hell are you two doing out here?

this city's been evacuated to where?
to shelters.
hell, you guys are lucky I found you.
I was on my last sweep.
Let's go!
but what about the glacier?
isn't it heade d right for us?
not for long.
there's a combined taskfor ce on its way to meet it.
so you've declared war on a glacier?
that's right.
it's the last chunk of the glacier, and they're putting everything they have on it.
now get your asses inside before I have you arrested!
go!
Go!
that's the last of the explosives, major.
good, good!
all explosives have been deployed.
roger that.
the charges are in place!
Take us back home!
copy that.
Prepare for extraction.
roger that.
hey, nelson.
Grab the computer.
I want to find out if we can connect to a satellite at this altitude.
got it.
Should take a sec.
reception blows up here.
I got a signal.
what do you want me to do?
okay, I want you to connect up to the noaa website.
I want to find out where that glacier is right now.
got it.
What's the login?
login is username julia, password, nelson.
dad, that's lame.
that is sweet.
lame or not, open up the tracking program.
now run the simulation with the same coordinates, but put in our gps location right now.
what are you looking for?
trying to find out how far away we are from that glacier.
okay, it's 50 miles behind us.
it's moving at 200 miles an hour.
what?
how can a glacier move at 200 miles per hour?
I have no idea.
I don't think anybody else does either.
can we outrun that?
are we gonna make it on time?
let's find out.
what's wrong?
we're icing up.
doesn't this model have de-icers?
. no.
We're gonna have to fly low if we're gonna make it we're burning fuel like crazy.
I need you guys to look outside and see if you can find any kind of private airfield, a crop dusting operation, anything.
you guys finding anything?
how far away are we from new york?
can't be more than 100 miles.
you guys seeing anything?
I don't see anything.
this visibility sucks balls.
nelson!
okay, guys, hold on.
We're gonna go lower.
anything?
nope, nothing.
we're still collecting a lot of ice.
I may have to put her down at any time, guys.
how much more ice can this thing take?
not a lot.
these headwinds are killing us.
we could walk there faster.
how much further is it?
about another 10 minutes.
i'm gonna try to land her at newark or la guardia.
will they allow us to land without a flight plan?
well, I'll just radio ahead and tell them we're an emergency.
they have to let us land.
what if there's no one there to hear us?
oh, crap!
teri: what?
we just ran out of fuel in the right fuel tank!
okay, guys, strap yourselves in.
get ready.
We're gonna have to go for an emergency landing.
really, bill?
yes!
Get ready!
god, look at all of these people.
well, at least we get free cookies.
you think your parents are still trying to find us?
I hope so.
what about your family?
dad's in northern europe near oslo.
it's probably the first hit.
it's okay.
i'm happy to be with you.
okay, you guys.
we got to get serious about finding another place to land, because we're not gonn a make it to newark.
we're entering into the new york air corridor now.
i'm gonna get on the radio and see if anybody's there listening.
give me the radio there, nelson.
newark tower, this is cessna... where's the flight number?
give me the flight number.
this is cessna number november niner, niner, 7-2-5.
declaring an emergency.
do you copy?
can they even hear us?
oh, I don't know.
what are we gonna do now?
well, we're gonna find a hole and slip into it.
buckle up, guys.
one way or another, we're gonna be on the ground in a couple of minutes, so hold on.
I need you guys to look around to see if you can see any other aircraft that might be landing without tower permission, okay?
brace yourselves!
two o'clock!
Look!
you okay?
you all right?
you okay?
yeah.
Yeah.
yeah?
Okay.
we're down.
Okay, okay.
let's get out, guy s.
Come on.
come on out.
come on, guys.
Here we go.
you okay?
yeah.
well, I guess we got out just in time.
hey, guys, look.
it's new york.
We did it!
almost there.
yeah. [laughs] did you crash that one eighty?
yeah.
I'm really sorry.
I got all the insurance information if you need it.
if a crashed cessna was all we had to worry about,
. i'd call it a good day come with me.
let's get you into someplace safe.
colonel sinor, this is command.
we are less than 30 seconds from detonation.
roger that.
we are all clear and standing by.
give me a long count, captain.
fire!
[laughs]
we got to get out of here.
were you guys headed into manhattan?
yeah, because we're trying to get our daughter.
i'm sorry.
no one's getting in and out of new york alive.
just stay here.
The national guard's gonna be here to get you.
don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.
i'll be right-- oh!
oh!
come on, get back!
Get back!
we just got to stay away from tall buildings with lots of glass, got it?
dad, we're going to manhattan.
point taken.
so how we gonna get there?
we got to get ourselves another car and then just drive into the city.
and go where?
To the dorm.
the dorm?
She's not at the dorm and you know that.
we can only hope she got our message.
what, to go to florida?
look, she may not be in new york, but we have start there.
from there, maybe we'll be able to find some sort of clue where she-- are you willing to sacrifice?
hey, guys!
are we going or what?
were the keys in the ignition?
I don't want to know.
I don't even want to know.
Let's just go.
i'm gonna try and get hold of her again.
if we're in jersey, how far is new york?
well, it shouldn't be too much longer.
we're coming up to the george washington bridge.
no signal.
it just keeps saying that all circuits are busy now.
it's not going through.
we just need to get under the gw.
i'll try to get the gps running.
is everyone trying to get to new york?
look at that mess.
nelson, see if you can find another way to the bridge.
sir, you're gonna have to turn your car around.
you can't get through here.
we have to get to manhattan.
that's impossible.
No one's going over there.
no, our daughter is there, and we need to pick her up.
I don't care if the pope's over there.
no one's going in new york right now.
look, it's not gonna matter soon anyway.
please just let us go.
but you can't go.
washington bridge, it's out.
wow!
the air force is coming in for their last air strike.
t, let's hope that does I or maybe none of us will get out of here.
come on, let's go!
what are you gonna do now, bill?
I don't know.
I'm out of ideas.
I know that's not true.
I know that you're thinking something.
What?
oh, it's just that remember when the kids were really, really young and we thought that if we could put some sort of tracking device on them, we'd always know where they are?
I knew I should have invented that device.
damn it!
wait, wait, guys!
we do have a tracking device!
what are you talking about, nelson?
oh, of course!
Of course what?
even if we can't talk to her on her phone, we can track her phone.
really?
We can do that?
yes.
Isn't that illegal?
don't ask.
I got it!
She's in new jersey!
new jersey?
she's here!
She's in new jersey!
oh, my god, bill.

We cannot keep going on like this!

ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY SEEMS TO BE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY.
I'M HEADING NORTH ON THE SHELF TO COLLECT MORE DATA.
COPY.
BLUE TEAM, REPORTS SHOW
THE HEKLA VOLCANO IS HAVING IMMENSE SEISMIC READINGS.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.
COPY THAT.
BASE CAMP, WE'RE SEEING INTENSE MAGNA FLOW
RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE RANGE.
IF IT KEEPS INCREASING,
WE MAY HAVE TO EVACUATE THE AREA NOW,
ALL THE LOCAL AREAS.
BASE CAMP, IF THE WHOLE RANGE STARTS ERUPTING,
WE'RE LOOKING AT A WHOLE GLACIER DETACHING FROM THE SHELF.
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?

HEKLA WENT BERSERK.
THERE'S A HUGE PRESSURE BUILDUP.
THE ENDURANCE READINGS ARE OFF THE CHART.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
EVERY SINGLE VOLCANO IS ERUPTING!
SAY AGAIN.
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

IT'S 1,000 MILES LONG!
BILL, DO YOU READ ME?
SOMETHING ABOUT THE VOLCANO.

I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR SISTER.
MOM'S GONNA KILL YOU.
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.
DAD, WHAT IS DR. CHANDRA SAYING ABOUT THE GLACIER?
DID IT CALF?
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT IT SOUNDED A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT.
THAT WOULD BE SICK.
SICK, HUH?
100%.
WHY DON'T YOU BRING UP THE SIMULATION AGAIN
ON THE PARAMETER SCREEN, OKAY?
OKAY, LET'S SEE.
OKAY, USING THESE NUMBERS,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
FOR THE ICE FLOW PROJECTION, OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ROY?
BILL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT IN THE FIELD.
I JUST SPOKE WITH DIVYA,
AND HE HAD SENT YOU SOME DATA.
DID YOU RECEIVE IT?
YEAH, THE HEKLA VOLCANO JUST ERUPTED.
NO, BUT IT SOUNDED MORE THAN THE HEKLA,
LIKE THE WHOLE RANGE WENT UP.
WE KNOW.
HART, GO HOME.
WE'VE GOT THIS.
I COULD BE PULLING MAPS OR CRUNCHING NUMBERS.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SEND ME HOME?
BILL, WE DON'T NEED YOU.
ROY, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR 15 YEARS.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

BILL, GET YOUR FAMILY OUT NOW.
WHAT DID YOU GET?
IT WON'T LET ME INPUT THIS DATA.
OKAY.
WELL, LET'S OPEN UP A TERMINAL WINDOW
AND WE'LL ENTER SANDBOX MODE.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, IT'S A MODE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO ENTER IN VARIABLES THAT ARE THEORETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS WE GOT TO GET YOUR MOM.
WHY?
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU ON THE WAY.
HOLD ON.
EXCUSE ME, SENATOR.
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,

OVER.
COPY THAT.
EAGLE CLIFF FLIGHT DECK CLEAR.
FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0 CLEAR TO TAKE OFF.
ROGER, I'M GETTING A VISUAL NOW.
THIS IS FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0.
IT'S HEADING TOWARDS NEWFOUNDLAND.
WHY IS IT GETTING DARKER?
THE WEATHER'S CHANGING.
DAD, ARE YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON?
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
I NEED TO CALL JULIA.
CAN WE GO HOME FIRST?
I NEED TO GET MY LAPTOP.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF TOWN.
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
DON'T THEY HAVE WI-FI ON AIRPLANES?
MAYBE IF SHE WAS FLYING FIRST CLASS.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FLYING AT ALL TODAY.
NOT TODAY.
DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S GONNA BE LANDING SOON.
WE'LL GET HOLD OF HER.
IT'LL BE OKAY.
WHOA.
USE WORDS, NELSON.
I DON'T THINK I CAN.
WHAT?
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING BACK HOME.
WHY NOT?
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.
LOOK AT THE CLOUDS.
WHAT CAN DO THAT?
GLACIERS.
REALLY, REALLY FAST GLACIERS.
OKAY, SO WHERE WE GOING?
NEW YORK.
TAKE US ABOUT 7, 8 HOURS.
HEY.
HEY!
I MISSED YOU.
I MISSED YOU, TOO.
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG.
TRAFFIC WAS A MESS.
I KNOW.
THEY GROUNDED ALL THE FLIGHTS.
THEY DID?
DAMN.
MM-HMM.
GUESS WE'RE GONNA BE HERE A WHILE, HUH?
WELL, THAT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING.
OOH, I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
OH, CRAP.
I'M SORRY.
WHO'S THAT?
NO ONE.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE DORM AND FOOL AROUND.
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
JULIA, WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU AT YOUR DORM, OKAY, HONEY?
SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE DORM, JUST STAY THERE, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU THERE.
ALL RIGHT, BIG HUGS, AND LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU.
BYE.
ARE YOU SURE THAT NEW YORK IS SAFE?
BILL?
HOW STUPID.
WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE HER FLY AND MEET US DOWN IN FLORIDA?
SWEETHEART, EVERYTHING IS GROUNDED.
I SAY WE STAY ON PLAN
AND WE JUST MEET HER AT THE DORM.
FINE.
OH, MY GOSH!
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE OKAY.
DAD, I THINK IT'S COMING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT!
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS?
NO.
THE GLACIERS ARE MAKING IT SNOW IN MAINE?
IT'S SUMMER.
CAN YOU JUST GET US OUT OF MAINE NOW?
HOW BIG DO THESE GLACIERS HAVE TO BE TO DO THIS?
BILL?
CRAP.
DAD, DOES THIS SNOW MEAN THE GLACIER'S GETTING CLOSE?
BILL, IT HAS TO BECAUSE THE CLOUDS ARE LOOKING MASSIVE.
I BET THIS GLACIER IS ENORMOUS,
LIKE THE WHOLE SHELF.
YEAH.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO.
I GOT TO FIND A WAY AROUND THIS TRAFFIC.
NELSON, JUMP ON THE GPS AND FIND ME AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.
ON IT.
BILL, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW!
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE GLACIER IS CLOSE.
THOSE MILITARY PLANES?
F-16s.
NELSON, FOCUS.
GPS.
TARGET IS 400 MILES OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST
AND IS NOW IN RANGE.
SIR, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
I SEE NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
THERE IS NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, LOOK AGAIN.
HOLY SH...
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
DELTA BRAVO ONE, DO YOU READ ME?
DELTA BRAVO ONE?
ALPHA FOXTROT, THIS IS CONTROL.
FIRE SEQUENCE IN 3... 2... 1...
FIRE!
OH, MY GOD!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?
IS IT GONE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
I THINK WE OUTRAN IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BILL?
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE?
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST PULL OVER.
NO, NOT YET, NOT YET.
EVERYTHING IS GONE, ISN'T IT?
JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT, NELSON?
EVERYTHING.
GOD, MY FRIENDS.
I NEED TO GET ONLINE!
NO, NO.
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT, OKAY?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!
NO, THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT!
MOM, YOUR CELL PHONE.
IT'S JULIA.
JULIA?
JULIA!
MOM!
OH, MY GOD.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?
WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.
DAD'S HERE AND NELSON'S HERE.
Julia:
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE DON'T KNOW.
THE NEWS IS SAYING THAT BANGOR JUST GOT DESTROYED.
TELL HER WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
Nelson:
MOM, CAN I JUST TALK TO HER?
TELL HER THAT WE'LL BE AT HER DORM
IN SIX HOURS FROM NOW.
WE'RE GONNA BE AT YOUR DORM IN SIX HOURS, OKAY?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
JULIA?
JULIA?
HELLO?
LET ME TALK TO HER.
JULIA, LISTEN.
IF THE WEATHER BREAKS, HEAD SOUTH TO FLORIDA
TO YOUR AUNT KISSY'S HOUSE.
THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU GO, THE SAFER IT IS.
JULIA?
HELLO?
JULIA?
HELLO?
SWEETHEART, IF YOU CAN...
MOM?
LOST IT.
DAD, I WANTED TO TALK TO HER.
SORRY, BUDDY.
WELL, WHAT?
MY PARENTS ARE COMING FOR ME.
I THINK THEY WANT US TO STAY AT THE DORM.
WELL, WE SHOULD GET GOING THEN.
YEAH.
IT'S GETTING COLD FAST.
COME ON!
Announcer:
EVACUATION IS MANDATORY
IN MOST NORTHEAST COASTAL TOWNS.
WE'VE BEEN INFORMED,
FOLLOWING AN ONSITE EVALUATION,
THE PRESIDENT WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE
WITH THE MOST CURRENT UPDATE.
THE MILITARY CURRENTLY HAS AWAC IN THE AIR
ASSESSING THE THREAT.
DROPPING OUT AT 400.
TARGET IS BREAKING UP,
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
SAY AGAIN, JOHNNY BRAVO.
TARGET IS SEPARATING INTO MULTIPLE SECTIONS
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT
HEADING SOUTH DOWN THE COAST.
WOW.
CLOUD COVER'S JUST SO THICK,
IT LOOKS LIKE NIGHT.
I'M GETTING NOTHING.
I'M TRYING TO CALL HER BACK.
LOOK, SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, OKAY?
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE OKAY.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF THE SENATOR.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYBODY.
DAD, YOU SAID THE PETERMANN GLACIER WAS HOW BIG?
LET'S SEE, THE LAST CALVING HAPPENED IN 2010.
THAT WAS ABOUT 100 SQUARE MILES,
WHICH IS ROUGHLY FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN,
AND THAT WAS ONLY 8% OF THE GLACIER.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S THE WHOLE GLACIER.
WITH ENOUGH SPEED, WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT COULD DO?
WHAT?
DAD!
WHICH WAY'S YOUR ROOM?
THIS WAY.
COME ON.
KAREN!
OH, MY GOD, JULIA.
I CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYONE IN MAINE.
JUST TRY AGAIN, OKAY?
IT TOOK ME THREE TRIES.
KEEP TRYING.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
KEEP TRYING.
IS THERE A BASEMENT?
NO, THERE'D BE NO RECEPTION IN THE BASEMENT.
I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.
COME ON, JULIA!
NO, THAT'S A MISTAKE.
NO, JULIA, WE HAVE TO GO!
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HURRY!
PUT YOUR JACKET ON.
WE GOT TO GO.
BUT MY DAD SAID TO STAY HERE.
I KNOW.
CALL HIM AND TELL HIM,
BUT WE AREN'T STAYING HERE, JULIA!
MOM!
DAD!
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE!
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN WE...
I LOST THE SIGNAL.
YOU THINK THE MESSAGE WENT THROUGH?
I HOPE SO.
SO THEN WHAT NOW?
HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THE CITY?
EVERYTHING'S SHUT DOWN.
WE GET TO ONE OF THE BRIDGES AND GET ACROSS THE RIVER!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
JULIA, WHAT ABOUT THE SUBWAY?
THE SUBWAYS ARE SHUT DOWN, TOO.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIN, JULIA.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TUNNELS.
WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH ONE OF THOSE.
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'LL WORK?
WOULD YOU RATHER STAY UP HERE?
COME ON!
OH...
OH.
YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY, DAD.
YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE OKAY.
WE'LL WORK OUR WAY OUT.
COME ON.
NELSON'S OKAY.
WE'RE GOOD.
THE SUN IS BREAKING THROUGH.
COME ON.
EASY, EASY.
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST A CUT.
COME ON.
GET NELSON.
COME ON, SWEETIE.
NELSON?
YOU OKAY?
BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
BROKEN BONES?
NO.
ANYTHING?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, OKAY.
GOOD JOB.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE, DAD.
GOOD JOB.
OKAY, LET'S GET MOVING.
LET'S GO.
WE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.
KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CAR.
SEE IF THAT VAN WORKS.
OKAY, GUYS, COME ON.
COME ON.
Nelson:
SO COLD.
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.
OKAY, GUYS, GET IN.
GET IN, HONEY.
LOOK FOR SOME KEYS.
I'M GONNA CHECK THIS OUT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
IT'S SO COLD.
WHERE'S DAD GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.
HELLO?
HELLO?
WHERE'S DAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK, THOUGH, HONEY.
MOM, THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION.
OH, GOOD.
LET'S START IT.
COME ON.
TRY AGAIN.
YES!
OKAY, GOOD.
IT'S A MESS IN HERE.
SMELLS LIKE SHIT.
OH, GOOD.
YOU GOT IT RUNNING.
YEAH.
OKAY, BAD NEWS.
THERE'S A BIG PILEUP.
WE GOT TO FIND A WAY...
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I THINK IT'S MANURE OR SOMETHING.
IT SMELLS AWFUL.
MANURE?
LIKE FERTILIZER?
YEAH.
WHAT KIND?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HONEY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT.
EXCELLENT.
OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHERE'D HE GO?
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE DAD COMES BACK SOON.
OKAY, INSIDE.
GO.
OKAY, HEADS DOWN.
HEADS DOWN.
HERE WE GO.
HEADS DOWN.
OKAY, WHY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.
WHAT KIND OF SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, BILL?
THE KIND THAT GOES BOOM.
SEE, WHEN YOU TAKE AMMONIUM NITRATE
AND YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIESEL FUEL, YOU GET...
WHOA!
DAD, WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO DO THAT?
IN SCIENCE CLASS.
OH, GOD, BILL.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION, I THINK.
I DO.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION.
PULL OVER.
PULL OVER RIGHT NOW!
MOM GOT A RECEPTION?
YEAH.
WELL?
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
IT'S JULIA.
WHERE WE GOING TO GO?
MOM, DAD, WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
NELSON, GET ON THE SHORTWAVE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL...
SOMETHING BAD HAS HIT HER DORM.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PLAYING IT AGAIN.
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
WE'RE NOT SAFE...
SOMETHING'S HIT THE DORM REALLY BAD AND SHE'S TRYING TO GET OUT.
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
SHE'S SAYING SHE CANNOT GET OUT OF NEW YORK CITY.
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?
IT'S A SONIC BOOM.
10 BIRDS IN FORMATION.
THEY'RE GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER.
CAN THEY DO THAT?
CAN THEY BOMB A GLACIER, BILL?
YEAH, THEY COULD DO THAT,
BUT THEY'D NEED TO HIT IT WITH A NUCLEAR BOMB
TO STOP THIS THING.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THEY SAID BOSTON'S GONNA BE HIT NEXT
IF THEY DON'T STOP IT.
BOSTON?
WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
OSCAR CHARLIE AND DELTA X-RAY APPROACHING TARGET.
ROGER, OSCAR CHARLIE.
ORDERING NUCLEAR PAYLOAD ACTIVE.
NUKES ARE HOT, WAITING FOR COUNTDOWN.
MY SON WAS BORN IN BOSTON, SO LET'S MELT THIS ICE.
ROGER THAT.
FIRE ONE!
OSCAR CHARLIE, DO YOU HAVE A VISUAL?
CHECKING NOW.
COMMAND 483.
NUKES DEPLOYED,
BUT THEY HAVE NO VISUAL EFFECT.
WAITING ON NEXT COMMAND.
EVERYONE LOOKS SO SCARED.
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
LOOK, WE GOT THIS BIG EMPTY VAN,
ALL THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP.
I FIGURE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL OPEN UP A DOOR...
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WE NEED TO GET HER, AND SHE IS OUR PRIORITY.
SHE'S OUR TOP PRIORITY, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
I FIGURE WE CAN HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE
RIDE WITH US TO NEW YORK.
IT'LL TAKE TWO MINUTES...
NO!
TWO MINUTES?
YEAH, TWO MINUTES.
HONEY, WE JUST CAN'T LEAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
HONEY?
MOM, DAD...
HEAR THAT?
EVERYBODY OKAY?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
I THINK WE MADE IT.
LET'S KEEP GOING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
BOSTON'S BEEN HIT!
THE GLACIER'S LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM US!
IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!
IT'S TOO LATE.
WE HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS NOT TO COME.
ALL THE CIRCUITS ARE BUSY.
NO SURPRISE THERE.
KEEP IT ON.
WE'LL TRY AGAIN LATER.
WE GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
COME ON.
BABE, I KNOW WHERE WE ARE.
WE COULD TAKE A TUNNEL.
WE TRIED THEM ALL.
THEY'RE CLOSED!
TRUST ME!
GO, GO.
HURRY.
HURRY!
BE CAREFUL.
CAREFUL.
WE USED TO GO THIS WAY WHEN WE WERE, LIKE, 12.
JUST NEED TO FIND A LIGHT.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WE REALLY HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE?
YEAH.
IT'S SAFER THAN UP THERE.
OH, GOD.
WHAT IF MY PARENTS TRY TO MAKE IT TO NEW YORK?
THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOUR MESSAGE.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF...
THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE.
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIND SOME GAS SOON.
I CAN LOG ON AND FIND US A GAS STATION.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, HONEY.
POWER GRID IS DOWN, BUDDY.
THAT MEANS NO WI-FI, NO GAS STATIONS.
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
WE JUST NEED TO FIND HIM SOME FOOD
AND LET'S FIND SOME GAS.
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S JUST START LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.
DAD, LOOK!
YOU CAN SIPHON GAS.
GREAT IDEA.
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S START LOOKING FOR CARS,
HOPEFULLY FILLED WITH FOOD.
HANG IN THERE, NELSON.
WE'RE ALMOST IN NEW YORK, OKAY?
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN, BILL.
I THINK I SEE SOME CARS IN THE DISTANCE.
Nelson:
IT'S JUST SO CREEPY
WHEN IT GETS DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
HONEY, JUST GET WHAT WE NEED AND GET BACK.
BE CAREFUL.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S IN THERE.
JUST STAY THERE.
WHY?
JUST STAY THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.
I GOT THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO PEE.
OKAY.
I'M GLAD THAT WAS YOU AND NOT ME.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
IT'S WORKING.
THAT IS SOME STRONG STUFF.
WHEW!
HEY, WE'RE IN CONNECTICUT.
HONEY?
I'M NOT STOPPING.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.
HEY, NELSON, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO PULL UP ANYTHING ON THE GPS?
NOT REALLY.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT?
HAND 'EM OVER.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE BACK THERE, CHEF NELSON?
OH, MAN!
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU GUYS.
YEAH, SURE YOU WERE.
DINNER?
THANKS.
THANK YOU, HONEY.
NELSON, HOW MUCH LONGER TO NEW YORK?
ABOUT TWO HOURS.
YOU THINK SHE'S STILL AT THE DORM?
I'M SURE YOUR SISTER'S FINE.
SHE'S A SMART GIRL AND SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
IT'S THIS WAY.
YOU SURE WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN HERE IN 10 YEARS.
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN AND TRUST ME, OKAY?
IT'S THE ONLY WAY, JULIA.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING DEEPER, THOUGH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER IT IS, IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
COME ON.
WOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE.
COME ON.
LET'S KEEP MOVING.
Nelson:
DAD, I GOT A FREQUENCY.
GO HENRY. 11-41 AND 44th AND...
INTERSECTION.
10-4...
LB.
AJ4-LB.
TURN TO CHANNEL 3 FOR FURTHER DETAILS.
COPY THAT.
THANK YOU.
YOU OKAY?
DO YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE?
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE.
SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
WE'RE ALMOST TO NEW YORK,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN.
WE'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN, OKAY?
OH, CRAP.
STAY HERE.
ARE WE IN NEW YORK?
NOT YET, HONEY.
NOT YET.
HEY!
IS YOUR CAR WORKING?
NO, IT'S OUT OF GAS.
OH, GAS, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BUT YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU'RE STUCK, BUT YOU'RE OKAY, RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
RIGHT.
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
NO REASON.
HEY, HEY!
ARE YOU ALONE?
HEY, ARE YOU ALONE?
'CAUSE I'M ALONE.
I'M HERE WITH MY FAMILY.
OH, THAT'S COOL, THAT'S COOL.
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY COLD OUT HERE, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOMEPLACE WARM.
YEAH, I'D SAY FIND YOURSELF A CAR AND STAY INSIDE.
YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO.
I'LL GET A CAR.
I'LL GO TO CALIFORNIA.
YOU KNOW, HEY, I'LL GO TO THE BEACH
AND THE PRETTY BLONDE WOMEN.
MAYBE HAVE TEQUILAS ON THE BEACH.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.
NICE MEETING YOU.
NO, NO, HEY, HEY, HEY!
I'M THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND I COULD GO TO CALIFORNIA TOGETHER.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK.
OH, YEAH, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK'S REALLY COLD,
AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO GO SOMEPLACE THAT'S WARM.
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU, OKAY?

WE NEED TO GO TO CALIFORNIA.
JUST CALM DOWN.
I GOT MY FAMILY RIGHT THERE.
JUST CALM DOWN.
LOOK AT ME!
WE'RE GOING TO CALIFORNIA.
I GOT SOME MONEY.
THAT CAN HELP.
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
I GOT SOME FOOD IF YOU WANT SOME FOOD.
I DON'T WANT YOUR FOOD.
HEY, WHAT KIND OF FOOD YOU GOT?
I NEED TO GET INTO THE VAN.
YEAH, YEAH.
NO, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
NO, GO, GO, GO.

HEY, GARY.
YEAH, HEY.
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING MAYBE
I NEED TO GET IN THE CAR.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK, REMEMBER?
HERE'S YOUR FOOD.

I'M THINKING THAT
I SHOULD GET IN THE CAR WITH YOU GUYS.
NO, NO, NO.
HEY!
HEY!
HEY!
BILL, COME ON.
I'M NOT A BAD GUY.
I HEAR YOU.
NO, NO, I'M A GOOD GUY.
I'M A GREAT GUY.
I JUST WANT TO GO SOMEPLACE WARM, YOU KNOW?

HEY, HEY, KID, KID, KID, KID!
LOCK THE DOORS, NELSON, LOCK THE DOORS!
DAD, DO SOMETHING!
Teri:

Bill:
I CAN'T WE'RE BLOCKED IN.
Nelson:
MY SISTER'S IN NEW YORK!
OPEN THE DOOR!
OPEN THE DOOR!
LOCK THE DOORS, NELSON.
LOCK THE DOORS!
YOU GUYS THINK I'M KIDDING?
CALM DOWN, MAN.
THINK I'M JOKING AROUND?
YOU'RE DEAD.

YOUR WHOLE FRIGGING FAMILY IS DEAD!
ALL OF YOU ARE FRIGGING DEAD!
YOU'RE DEAD!
OPEN THE DOOR, KID.
Bill:
EVERYBODY OUT.
COME ON.
COME ON, TERI, OUT.
GET OUT, NELSON.

PLEASE.
OH, GOD!

LET'S RUN!
WATCH OUT!
COME ON, GUYS.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
WE DID IT.
IT'S SNOWING AGAIN.
OKAY, LET'S GET ANOTHER VEHICLE.
LET'S TRY THIS WAY.
COME ON.
WHERE ARE WE?
IT'S THE LINCOLN TUNNEL.
WE CAN TAKE THIS ALL THE WAY TO NEW JERSEY.
AND HOW FAR IS THAT?
IT'S ABOUT A MILE.
COME ON.
Bill:
COME ON.
DAD, I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP GOING.
GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
IF WE STOP, WE DIE.
LET'S JUST GO.
HONEY, IS THAT A HOUSE?
SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.
COME ON.
CAN WE GO?
YEP, LET'S TRY IT.
COME ON.
IT'S SO COLD.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW, GUYS.
IT'S SO COLD.
HELLO!
COME ON IN, GUYS.
SIT DOWN.
GET WARM.
HELLO?
I DIDN'T SEE A CAR OUT FRONT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY LEFT HERE PRETTY QUICKLY.
HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE IF YOU FIND SOME CLOTHES,
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME FOOD,
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
HELLO?
HELLO?
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU, JULIA.
HERE, HONEY, I FOUND THESE UPSTAIRS.
OH, GREAT.
HERE YOU GO.
SHOULD WE JUST LET HIM SLEEP?
NO, NO, NO.
WE GOT TO GET GOING.
IT MAY LOOK LIKE NIGHT,
BUT IT'S ONLY 3:00 P.M.
COME ON, WAKE UP, NELSON.
IT'S TIME TO GO.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE GOT TO DO IT ON FOOT.
GET GOING AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND ONE ON THE WAY.
HERE, HONEY.
SHH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HELLO?
WE'RE JUST HERE FOR SOME WARM CLOTHES.
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
THANK YOU!
WAIT!
MY DADDY'S HURT.
WESLEY, COME HERE.
OH, THANK GOD.
I THINK HE CAME THIS WAY.
OH.
I FOUND PEOPLE.
LISTEN TO ME.
DON'T YOU EVER LEAVE ME, OKAY?
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
CAN WE HELP?
YOU OKAY?
I WAS TRYING TO LOAD OUR TRUCK UP
AND THIS WHOLE THING FELL ON ME.
IT'S GOT MY LEG PINNED DOWN HERE.
OKAY, ON THE COUNT OF THREE, GUYS.
YOU READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE...
LET IT GO.
LET IT GO.
I THINK IF YOU LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP,
I CAN PROBABLY SHIMMY OUT.
OKAY, READY?
GOT IT?
OH, YEAH.
YOU GOT IT?
YOU CLEAR?
YEAH.
HERE.
GET UP.
DADDY, YOU'RE BLEEDING.
I'LL BE OKAY, SON.
MAN, THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME ALONG.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WE LOST OUR VAN AT THE RIVER
AND YOUR PLACE WAS THE FIRST PLACE WE CAME UPON.
I HAVE A VEST JUST LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THIS IS YOUR VEST.
WE KIND OF BROKE INTO YOUR PLACE.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE.
RELAX.
LOOK, ANYTHING YOU NEED HERE,
FEEL FREE TO HELP YOURSELF.
BESIDES, THIS PLACE ISN'T EVEN GONNA BE HERE IN A HOUR.
ARE WE GONNA FLY NOW?
NO, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE TRUCK, REMEMBER?
LOOK, YOU GUYS, WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM.
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
WHICH WAY YOU GUYS HEADED?
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HEAD WEST.
YEAH, WE'RE HEADED TO NEW YORK.
NEW YORK?
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE YOU WANT TO GO.
THIS ICEBERG IS CHEWING UP THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEW YORK.
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WELL, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
ME AND WESLEY, WE'RE GOING WEST.
HEY, IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?
MY DADDY CAN FLY.
SO CAN MINE.
DOES THIS STILL WORK?
SURE DOES.
ME AND WESLEY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN JAMAICA BY NOW,
BUT ONLY A FOOL WOULD GO UP IN THIS WEATHER.
GUYS, WE'RE ALL PACKED UP.
WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT.
YOU'RE STILL MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT I THINK I SHOULD GO
AND I'LL MEET YOU GUYS IN FLORIDA.
I AM NOT LEAVING YOU, EVER.
DAD, DAD, YOU NEED ME TO NAVIGATE.
OKAY.
GOOD LUCK.
YOU, TOO.
NELSON.
OKAY, NELSON, GET THIS OUT OF THE TARP.
LET'S GO.
BE CAREFUL.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE UNTIL THE GLACIER GETS HERE?
YOU HEAR THAT?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
NOT LONG.
LET'S GO.
COME ON!
GO!
THERE IT IS!
JERSEY!
COME ON, JULIA!
COME ON!
WE GOT TO GO!
ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
YOU READY?
ALL RIGHT, DAD!
WE CAN PROBABLY BE IN NEW YORK IN 30 MINUTES.
JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS BUMPY RIDE.
THESE CLOUDS DON'T LOOK NORMAL.
Teri:
NOTHING LOOKS NORMAL.
IS THAT A TWISTER?
BILL, FLY US OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAN YOU FLY ABOVE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T WE HAVE A WEATHER DETECTION DEVICE?
I DON'T SEE ONE.
BILL, WE'RE FLYING RIGHT INTO THE THICK OF THAT.
HOLD ON!
DAD, YOU GOT TO GET US OUT OF HERE!
FLY HIGHER!
HIGHER, BILL!
HA HA!
AMAZING, DAD.
DAD!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
ARE THEY GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
Pilot:
EVERYTHING PROCEEDING PROPERLY, APPROACHING GLACIER.
ROGER THAT.
WE'RE AT THE OBSERVATION LOCATION.
WE'RE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 3-500 FEET
AND SIX MILES FROM LOCATION IMPACT.
WE NEED THE COORDINATES TO PLANT THE EXPLOSIONS.
ROGER THAT.
SENDING THEM NOW.
TEAMS FIVE AND SIX HAVE LANDED,
WAITING FOR SUPPLIES.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE DESCENDING NOW.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
AN HOUR TILL IMPACT.
AFFIRMATIVE?
63 MINUTES, MAJOR.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON, COME ON, GET IT, GO, GO!
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
HOW LONG UNTIL THE PAYLOAD DROP?
ARRIVING NOW.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON.
WE HAVE TO FIND SHELTER.
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS I'M IN JERSEY.
WE WILL.
COME ON.
CAN WE JUST STOP?
I'M TIRED.
NOT YET.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
HEY!
AAH!
AAH!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT!
HEY, LET HER GO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!
LET HIM GO!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT OR I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
STOP!
STOP!
Man:
NATIONAL GUARD!
STOP!
ARE YOU OKAY?
STOP!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING OUT HERE?
THIS CITY'S BEEN EVACUATED!
TO WHERE?
TO SHELTERS.
HELL, YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY I FOUND YOU.
I WAS ON MY LAST SWEEP.
LET'S GO!
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GLACIER?
ISN'T IT HEADED RIGHT FOR US?
NOT FOR LONG.
THERE'S A COMBINED TASKFORCE ON ITS WAY TO MEET IT.
SO YOU'VE DECLARED WAR ON A GLACIER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE LAST CHUNK OF THE GLACIER,
AND THEY'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ON IT.
NOW GET YOUR ASSES INSIDE BEFORE I HAVE YOU ARRESTED!
GO!
GO!
THAT'S THE LAST OF THE EXPLOSIVES, MAJOR.
GOOD, GOOD!
ALL EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED.
ROGER THAT.
THE CHARGES ARE IN PLACE!
TAKE US BACK HOME!
COPY THAT.
PREPARE FOR EXTRACTION.
ROGER THAT.
HEY, NELSON.
GRAB THE COMPUTER.
I WANT TO FIND OUT
IF WE CAN CONNECT TO A SATELLITE AT THIS ALTITUDE.
GOT IT.
SHOULD TAKE A SEC.
RECEPTION BLOWS UP HERE.
I GOT A SIGNAL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO CONNECT UP TO THE NOAA WEBSITE.
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT GLACIER IS RIGHT NOW.
GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE LOGIN?
LOGIN IS USERNAME JULIA,
PASSWORD, NELSON.
DAD, THAT'S LAME.
THAT IS SWEET.
LAME OR NOT, OPEN UP THE TRACKING PROGRAM.
NOW RUN THE SIMULATION WITH THE SAME COORDINATES,
BUT PUT IN OUR GPS LOCATION RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW FAR AWAY WE ARE FROM THAT GLACIER.
OKAY, IT'S 50 MILES BEHIND US.
IT'S MOVING AT 200 MILES AN HOUR.
WHAT?
HOW CAN A GLACIER MOVE AT 200 MILES PER HOUR?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE DOES EITHER.
CAN WE OUTRUN THAT?
ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT ON TIME?
LET'S FIND OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WE'RE ICING UP.
DOESN'T THIS MODEL HAVE DE-ICERS?
NO.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FLY LOW IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
WE'RE BURNING FUEL LIKE CRAZY.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK OUTSIDE
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY KIND OF PRIVATE AIRFIELD,
A CROP DUSTING OPERATION, ANYTHING.
YOU GUYS FINDING ANYTHING?
HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM NEW YORK?
CAN'T BE MORE THAN 100 MILES.
YOU GUYS SEEING ANYTHING?
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
THIS VISIBILITY SUCKS BALLS.
NELSON!
OKAY, GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE GONNA GO LOWER.
ANYTHING?
NOPE, NOTHING.
WE'RE STILL COLLECTING A LOT OF ICE.
I MAY HAVE TO PUT HER DOWN AT ANY TIME, GUYS.
HOW MUCH MORE ICE CAN THIS THING TAKE?
NOT A LOT.
THESE HEADWINDS ARE KILLING US.
WE COULD WALK THERE FASTER.
HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT?
ABOUT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.
I'M GONNA TRY TO LAND HER AT NEWARK OR LA GUARDIA.
WILL THEY ALLOW US TO LAND WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN?
WELL, I'LL JUST RADIO AHEAD
AND TELL THEM WE'RE AN EMERGENCY.
THEY HAVE TO LET US LAND.
WHAT IF THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HEAR US?
OH, CRAP!
Teri:
WHAT?
WE JUST RAN OUT OF FUEL IN THE RIGHT FUEL TANK!
OKAY, GUYS, STRAP YOURSELVES IN.
GET READY.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING.
REALLY, BILL?
YES!
GET READY!
GOD, LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
WELL, AT LEAST WE GET FREE COOKIES.
YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND US?
I HOPE SO.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?
DAD'S IN NORTHERN EUROPE NEAR OSLO.
IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST HIT.
IT'S OKAY.
I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU.
OKAY, YOU GUYS.
WE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LAND,
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO NEWARK.
WE'RE ENTERING INTO THE NEW YORK AIR CORRIDOR NOW.
I'M GONNA GET ON THE RADIO
AND SEE IF ANYBODY'S THERE LISTENING.
GIVE ME THE RADIO THERE, NELSON.
NEWARK TOWER, THIS IS CESSNA...
WHERE'S THE FLIGHT NUMBER?
GIVE ME THE FLIGHT NUMBER.
THIS IS CESSNA NUMBER NOVEMBER NINER, NINER, 7-2-5.
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
DO YOU COPY?
CAN THEY EVEN HEAR US?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND A HOLE AND SLIP INTO IT.
BUCKLE UP, GUYS.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE GROUND
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, SO HOLD ON.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK AROUND
TO SEE IF YOU CAN SEE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT
THAT MIGHT BE LANDING WITHOUT TOWER PERMISSION, OKAY?
BRACE YOURSELVES!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH?
OKAY.
WE'RE DOWN.
OKAY, OKAY.
LET'S GET OUT, GUYS.
COME ON.
COME ON OUT.
COME ON, GUYS.
HERE WE GO.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WELL, I GUESS WE GOT OUT JUST IN TIME.
HEY, GUYS, LOOK.
IT'S NEW YORK.
WE DID IT!
ALMOST THERE.
YEAH.
DID YOU CRASH THAT ONE EIGHTY?
YEAH.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I GOT ALL THE INSURANCE INFORMATION IF YOU NEED IT.
IF A CRASHED CESSNA WAS ALL WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT,
I'D CALL IT A GOOD DAY.
COME WITH ME.
LET'S GET YOU INTO SOMEPLACE SAFE.
COLONEL SINOR, THIS IS COMMAND.
WE ARE LESS THAN 30 SECONDS FROM DETONATION.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE ALL CLEAR AND STANDING BY.
GIVE ME A LONG COUNT, CAPTAIN.
FIRE!
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
WERE YOU GUYS HEADED INTO MANHATTAN?
YEAH, BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR DAUGHTER.
I'M SORRY.
NO ONE'S GETTING IN AND OUT OF NEW YORK ALIVE.
JUST STAY HERE.
THE NATIONAL GUARD'S GONNA BE HERE TO GET YOU.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT...
OH!
OH!
COME ON, GET BACK!
GET BACK!
WE JUST GOT TO STAY AWAY FROM TALL BUILDINGS
WITH LOTS OF GLASS, GOT IT?
DAD, WE'RE GOING TO MANHATTAN.
POINT TAKEN.
SO HOW WE GONNA GET THERE?
WE GOT TO GET OURSELVES ANOTHER CAR
AND THEN JUST DRIVE INTO THE CITY.
AND GO WHERE?
TO THE DORM.
THE DORM?
SHE'S NOT AT THE DORM AND YOU KNOW THAT.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE SHE GOT OUR MESSAGE.
WHAT, TO GO TO FLORIDA?
LOOK, SHE MAY NOT BE IN NEW YORK,
BUT WE HAVE START THERE.
FROM THERE, MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
SOME SORT OF CLUE WHERE SHE...
ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE?
HEY, GUYS!
ARE WE GOING OR WHAT?
WERE THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.
LET'S JUST GO.
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET HOLD OF HER AGAIN.
IF WE'RE IN JERSEY, HOW FAR IS NEW YORK?
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER.
WE'RE COMING UP TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.
NO SIGNAL.
IT JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY NOW.
IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH.
WE JUST NEED TO GET UNDER THE GW.
I'LL TRY TO GET THE GPS RUNNING.
IS EVERYONE TRYING TO GET TO NEW YORK?
LOOK AT THAT MESS.
NELSON, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO THE BRIDGE.
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN YOUR CAR AROUND.
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH HERE.
WE HAVE TO GET TO MANHATTAN.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE'S GOING OVER THERE.
NO, OUR DAUGHTER IS THERE, AND WE NEED TO PICK HER UP.
I DON'T CARE IF THE POPE'S OVER THERE.
NO ONE'S GOING IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER SOON ANYWAY.
PLEASE JUST LET US GO.
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.
WASHINGTON BRIDGE, IT'S OUT.
WOW!
THE AIR FORCE IS COMING IN FOR THEIR LAST AIR STRIKE.
LET'S HOPE THAT DOES IT,
OR MAYBE NONE OF US WILL GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW, BILL?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THINKING SOMETHING.
WHAT?
OH, IT'S JUST THAT
REMEMBER WHEN THE KIDS WERE REALLY, REALLY YOUNG
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE COULD PUT
SOME SORT OF TRACKING DEVICE ON THEM,
WE'D ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE INVENTED THAT DEVICE.
DAMN IT!
WAIT, WAIT, GUYS!
WE DO HAVE A TRACKING DEVICE!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, NELSON?
OH, OF COURSE!
OF COURSE WHAT?
EVEN IF WE CAN'T TALK TO HER ON HER PHONE,
WE CAN TRACK HER PHONE.
REALLY?
WE CAN DO THAT?
YES.
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?
DON'T ASK.
I GOT IT!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
NEW JERSEY?
SHE'S HERE!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
OH, MY GOD, BILL.
WHERE?
UM...
FOUR MILES THAT WAY.
TWO MORE MILES.
HURRY, BILL!
OKAY, PEOPLE, THIS IS IT!
STAY BACK.
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT...
HOW FAR ARE WE?
1.7 MILES.
WHICH WAY DO WE GO?
THERE'S GONNA BE A DEAD END ON YOUR LEFT,
SO WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT.
OKAY, GUYS, HERE WE GO.
HOLD ON A SECOND!
T MINUS 2 MINUTES FOR LAUNCH.
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH THIS.
HOW FAR AWAY IS SHE?
DAD, SHE'S JUST TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
OKAY, WE'RE GOING ON FOOT, GUYS.
COME ON.
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S THE GPS SAY?
SHE'S THAT WAY!
ONE MORE BLOCK THIS WAY!
JUST OVER A BLOCK!
OH!
DAD, MY PHONE!
GOT TO GET MY PHONE TO FIND HER!
NELSON, LISTEN TO ME.
WE'LL FIND HER.
FORGET IT, FORGET IT!
WE DON'T HAVE TIME!
LET'S GO.
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!

DADDY!
OH, JULIA, ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M FINE.
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, MY GOD.
OH, THANK GOD.
OH, BABY.
HI, BABY.
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
WE GOT HER.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET ME SEE YOU.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
DAD, THIS IS LOGAN.
HI, LOGAN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GET TO SAFETY, GUYS.
COME ON.
Nelson:
DAD, DRIVE!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
THE BRIDGES ARE DOWN, STREETS ARE BLOCKED, THE RIVER'S FROZEN.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
DADDY?
Logan:
ARE YOU DRIVING ON THE HUDSON RIVER?
IS IT GONNA HOLD?
Nelson:
IT DIDN'T LAST TIME.
Julia:
LAST TIME?
WHAT?
Nelson:
YOU SEE THAT?
THOSE ARE F-16s GOING IN!
Teri:
WHAT WAS THAT?
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING BIG JUST BLEW UP.
Teri:
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE CANNOT KEEP GOING ON LIKE THIS!
I KNOW!
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY OFF THE RIVER!
ANY IDEAS?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
OKAY, IF WE CAN MAKE IT.
GLACIER APPEARS TO BE BREAKING UP.
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT!
LET'S GO!
OKAY, GO ON THROUGH!
COME ON THROUGH!
LET'S GO!
NO, NO, NO, FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS!
KEEP GOING!
HURRY!
OKAY, GET DOWN.
GET DOWN.
HONEY.
HEAR ANYTHING?
NO.
IS IT DONE?
HOLD ON.
COME ON.
COME ON UP.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
OH.
BLUE TEAM TO BASE CAMP.
GO, BLUE TEAM.
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY SEEMS TO BE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY.
I'M HEADING NORTH ON THE SHELF TO COLLECT MORE DATA.
COPY.
BLUE TEAM, REPORTS SHOW
THE HEKLA VOLCANO IS HAVING IMMENSE SEISMIC READINGS.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.
COPY THAT.
BASE CAMP, WE'RE SEEING INTENSE MAGNA FLOW
RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE RANGE.
IF IT KEEPS INCREASING,
WE MAY HAVE TO EVACUATE THE AREA NOW,
ALL THE LOCAL AREAS.
BASE CAMP, IF THE WHOLE RANGE STARTS ERUPTING,
WE'RE LOOKING AT A WHOLE GLACIER DETACHING FROM THE SHELF.
[HORNS HONKING]
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
CAN I REALLY TALK TO BASE ON THIS THING?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
TRY A LOWER BAND.
THERE YOU GO.
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
[SIGHS] JUST CAN'T GET IT.
THERE'S TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE.
I'M GOING TO TAKE DOWN A PLANE WITH THIS THING.
BETTER NOT.
HEY, DID YOU PACK YOUR GORTEX?
HELLO?
JULIA?
JULIA?
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU HEARD ME A SECOND AGO.
MOM PACKED IT.
WELL, GOOD, I'M GLAD.

DAD!
6SNL7, COME IN.
THIS IS SUMMIT CAMP.
GO AHEAD.
DIVYA?
HEY, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I'M BRINGING SOME NEW INSTRUMENTS NEXT WEEK.
BILL, HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE DATA WE SENT?
NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT IN THE OFFICE.
I'M DROPPING JULIA OFF AT THE AIRPORT.
WHY?
WHAT'S UP?
WE'RE EVACUATING.
THE REST OF THE TEAM IS GONE ALREADY.
I'M THE LAST MAN STANDING.
EVACUATING?
WHY?
DAD, I SHOULD JUST WALK FROM HERE.
HEKLA WENT BERSERK.
THERE'S A HUGE PRESSURE BUILDUP.
THE ENDURANCE READINGS ARE OFF THE CHART.
THE ENTIRE HEKLA LINE IS ERUPTING.
THERE IS PRESSURE BUILDING UP EVERYWHERE.
BILL, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
PRESSURE BUILDING UP WHERE?
AT WHAT SITE?
I'M TRYING.
GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE SEEING ACTIVITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE RANGE.
WAIT, AT ALL THE SITES?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, DIVYA.
I CHECKED WITH THE OTHER STATIONS.
NO ONE'S EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
I SENT YOU EVERYTHING WE GOT
BEFORE THE CENTERS MELTED DOWN, BILL.
LOOK AT THE DATA!
NO, I'M NOT AT THE OFFICE.
I'LL BE THERE IN AN HOUR.
PULL UP THE COMPUTER SIMULATION.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
DIVYA?
[HORNS HONKING]
OKAY, I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL NOW.
NO NEED TO SAY GOODBYE OR ANYTHING.
REYKJANES RIDGE?
YEAH.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
MAGNA FLOW RATE?
F7.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK AROUND CHRISTMASTIME
UNLESS I DECIDE TO STAY IN NEW YORK FOREVER.
DIVYA, COME IN.
DIVYA, IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME,
I WILL LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I WILL CONTACT YOU
AS SOON AS I GET TO THE OFFICE.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
6SNL7, COME IN.
5-3-7-6-E-9.
6SNL7, DO YOU COPY?
SIR, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
IT'S FINE.
I'M JUST DROPPING MY DAUGHTER OFF.
WE'LL BE TWO MINUTES.
6SNL7, DO YOU READ?
SIR?
OH, MY GOD.
COME IN, 6SNL7.
DO YOU READ?
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
SIR?
HART, DO YOU READ ME?
YES, GO AHEAD, DIVYA.
I READ YOU.
GO AHEAD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
SIR, THIS IS A NO PARKING ZONE.
THIS IS LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY.
I NEED YOU TO MOVE YOUR--
THIS IS MASSIVE!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
EVERY SINGLE VOLCANO IS ERUPTING!
SAY AGAIN.
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
THE ENTIRE ICE SHELF IS FRACTURING!
IT'S 1,000 MILES LONG!
BILL, DO YOU READ ME?
[ALARM BEEPS]
[STATIC]
SOMETHING ABOUT THE VOLCANO.
IS NOT MOVING.
DAD, WE NEED TO GO.
LOOK.
YEAH.
WHERE'S JULIA?
SHE LEFT, LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.
WHAT?
AH, CRAP.
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE, DAD?
NO, NO, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED HER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR SISTER.
MOM'S GONNA KILL YOU.
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.
DAD, WHAT IS DR. CHANDRA SAYING ABOUT THE GLACIER?
DID IT CALF?
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT IT SOUNDED A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT.
THAT WOULD BE SICK.
SICK, HUH?
100%.
WHY DON'T YOU BRING UP THE SIMULATION AGAIN
ON THE PARAMETER SCREEN, OKAY?
OKAY, LET'S SEE.
OKAY, USING THESE NUMBERS,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
FOR THE ICE FLOW PROJECTION, OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ROY?
BILL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT IN THE FIELD.
I JUST SPOKE WITH DIVYA,
AND HE HAD SENT YOU SOME DATA.
DID YOU RECEIVE IT?
YEAH, THE HEKLA VOLCANO JUST ERUPTED.
NO, BUT IT SOUNDED MORE THAN THE HEKLA,
LIKE THE WHOLE RANGE WENT UP.
WE KNOW.
HART, GO HOME.
WE'VE GOT THIS.
I COULD BE PULLING MAPS OR CRUNCHING NUMBERS.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SEND ME HOME?
BILL, WE DON'T NEED YOU.
ROY, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR 15 YEARS.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?
BILL, I HAVE JUST PUT CYNTHIA AND MY KIDS
ON A PLANE TO MEXICO.
YOU DO THE SAME.
WE HAVE GOT CHUNKS OF ICE
FALLING ALL OVER CANADA.
IN 19 HOURS, THE BULK OF THE GLACIER
IS GOING TO HIT NORTH AMERICA.
BILL, GET YOUR FAMILY OUT NOW.
WHAT DID YOU GET?
IT WON'T LET ME INPUT THIS DATA.
OKAY.
WELL, LET'S OPEN UP A TERMINAL WINDOW
AND WE'LL ENTER SANDBOX MODE.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, IT'S A MODE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO ENTER IN VARIABLES THAT ARE THEORETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS WE GOT TO GET YOUR MOM.
WHY?
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU ON THE WAY.
HOLD ON.
EXCUSE ME, SENATOR.
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
BUT I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CYRUS
OVER AT AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES,
AND HE SAID THAT ALL THE FLIGHTS ARE GROUNDED
BECAUSE OF THE VOLCANIC ASH FLOW.
GET QUINCY IN DC AND ASK HIM
IF THEY'RE GONNA POSTPONE THE SUMMIT.
YES, SENATOR.
HEY.
YOUR DAUGHTER'S FLYING OUT TODAY.
YES.
STARTING COLLEGE.
NYU.
TERI, THESE VOLCANOES ARE IN GREENLAND.
JULIA'S FLYING INTO NEW YORK.
SHE'LL BE FINE.
I HOPE SO.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, SIR.
THANK YOU.
TERI?
TERI?
TERI?
BILL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
NO, NO.
JULIA IS FINE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
PLEASE DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS TALKING TO DIVYA ABOUT THE PETERMANN GLACIER.
DIVYA?
PETERMANN?
WHAT IS THAT?
HI, BILL.
HI, SENATOR.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT WITH JULIA?
EVERYTHING'S FINE WITH JULIA, SENATOR.
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
BUT YOU NEED TO LEAVE TOWN RIGHT NOW, SIR.
BILL!
BILL WAS JUST LEAVING, SENATOR.
SO SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
LOOK, THERE IS A HUGE GLACIER COMING OUR WAY,
AND IT'S COMING AT US REALLY, REALLY QUICK.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF TOWN!
LISTEN, I HAVE A SUMMIT MEETING.
NO, NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND.
MOM, MOM!
THIS IS TRUE!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF MAINE.
REALLY?
YOU'RE GONNA BRING OUR SON INTO ALL YOUR WEATHER--
IT'S TRUE!
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SO SORRY.
HI, JOSH.
HI.
HEY, BILL.
I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYBODY
ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE SUMMIT.
NOT EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE IS PICKING UP.
YOU'D BETTER BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
JOSH, GO HOME.
WHAT?
NO, DON'T GO HOME.
GET OUT OF MAINE.
GO AS FAR SOUTH AS YOU CAN!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
Teri:
DON'T SCARE HIM LIKE THAT!
EAGLE CLIFF, FLIGHT DECK.
REQUESTING SAT-COM COORDINATES.
OVER.
HOLD FOR GPS.
GLACIER LOCATED.
58-42 NORTH, 39-02 WEST,

COPY THAT.
EAGLE CLIFF FLIGHT DECK CLEAR.
FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0 CLEAR TO TAKE OFF.
ROGER, I'M GETTING A VISUAL NOW.
THIS IS FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0.
IT'S HEADING TOWARDS NEWFOUNDLAND.
WHY IS IT GETTING DARKER?
THE WEATHER'S CHANGING.
DAD, ARE YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON?
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
I NEED TO CALL JULIA.
CAN WE GO HOME FIRST?
I NEED TO GET MY LAPTOP.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF TOWN.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
DON'T THEY HAVE WI-FI ON AIRPLANES?
MAYBE IF SHE WAS FLYING FIRST CLASS.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FLYING AT ALL TODAY.
NOT TODAY.
DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S GONNA BE LANDING SOON.
WE'LL GET HOLD OF HER.
IT'LL BE OKAY.
WHOA.
USE WORDS, NELSON.
I DON'T THINK I CAN.
WHAT?
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING BACK HOME.
WHY NOT?
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.
LOOK AT THE CLOUDS.
WHAT CAN DO THAT?
GLACIERS.
REALLY, REALLY FAST GLACIERS.
OKAY, SO WHERE WE GOING?
NEW YORK.
TAKE US ABOUT 7, 8 HOURS.
HEY.
HEY!
[LAUGHS]
I MISSED YOU.
I MISSED YOU, TOO.
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG.
TRAFFIC WAS A MESS.
I KNOW.
THEY GROUNDED ALL THE FLIGHTS.
THEY DID?
DAMN.
MM-HMM.
GUESS WE'RE GONNA BE HERE A WHILE, HUH?
WELL, THAT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING.
OOH, I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
[CELL PHONE BUZZES]
OH, CRAP.
I'M SORRY.
WHO'S THAT?
NO ONE.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE DORM AND FOOL AROUND.
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
JULIA, WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU AT YOUR DORM, OKAY, HONEY?
SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE DORM, JUST STAY THERE, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU THERE.
ALL RIGHT, BIG HUGS, AND LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU.
BYE.
ARE YOU SURE THAT NEW YORK IS SAFE?
BILL?
HOW STUPID.
WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE HER FLY AND MEET US DOWN IN FLORIDA?
SWEETHEART, EVERYTHING IS GROUNDED.
I SAY WE STAY ON PLAN
AND WE JUST MEET HER AT THE DORM.
FINE.
OH, MY GOSH!
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE OKAY.
DAD, I THINK IT'S COMING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT!
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS?
NO.
THE GLACIERS ARE MAKING IT SNOW IN MAINE?
IT'S SUMMER.
CAN YOU JUST GET US OUT OF MAINE NOW?
HOW BIG DO THESE GLACIERS HAVE TO BE TO DO THIS?
BILL?
[HORNS HONKING]
CRAP.
DAD, DOES THIS SNOW MEAN THE GLACIER'S GETTING CLOSE?
BILL, IT HAS TO BECAUSE THE CLOUDS ARE LOOKING MASSIVE.
I BET THIS GLACIER IS ENORMOUS,
LIKE THE WHOLE SHELF.
YEAH.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO.
I GOT TO FIND A WAY AROUND THIS TRAFFIC.
NELSON, JUMP ON THE GPS AND FIND ME AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.
ON IT.
BILL, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW!
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE GLACIER IS CLOSE.
THOSE MILITARY PLANES?
F-16s.
NELSON, FOCUS.
GPS.
TARGET IS 400 MILES OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST
AND IS NOW IN RANGE.
SIR, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
I SEE NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
THERE IS NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, LOOK AGAIN.
HOLY SH--
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
DELTA BRAVO ONE, DO YOU READ ME?
DELTA BRAVO ONE?
ALPHA FOXTROT, THIS IS CONTROL.
FIRE SEQUENCE IN 3...2... 1...
FIRE!
OH, MY GOD!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?
IS IT GONE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
I THINK WE OUTRAN IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BILL?
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE?
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST PULL OVER.
NO, NOT YET, NOT YET.
EVERYTHING IS GONE, ISN'T IT?
JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT, NELSON?
EVERYTHING.
GOD, MY FRIENDS.
I NEED TO GET ONLINE!
NO, NO.
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT, OKAY?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!
NO, THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT!
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
MOM, YOUR CELL PHONE.
IT'S JULIA.
JULIA?
JULIA!
MOM!
OH, MY GOD.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?
WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.
DAD'S HERE AND NELSON'S HERE.
Julia:
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE DON'T KNOW.
THE NEWS IS SAYING THAT BANGOR JUST GOT DESTROYED.
TELL HER WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
Nelson:
MOM, CAN I JUST TALK TO HER?
TELL HER THAT WE'LL BE AT HER DORM
IN SIX HOURS FROM NOW.
WE'RE GONNA BE AT YOUR DORM IN SIX HOURS, OKAY?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
JULIA?
JULIA?
[STATIC]
HELLO?
LET ME TALK TO HER.
JULIA, LISTEN.
IF THE WEATHER BREAKS, HEAD SOUTH TO FLORIDA
TO YOUR AUNT KISSY'S HOUSE.
THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU GO, THE SAFER IT IS.
JULIA?
HELLO?
JULIA?
HELLO?
SWEETHEART, IF YOU CAN...[BREAKING UP]
MOM?
LOST IT.
DAD, I WANTED TO TALK TO HER.
SORRY, BUDDY.
WELL, WHAT?
MY PARENTS ARE COMING FOR ME.
I THINK THEY WANT US TO STAY AT THE DORM.
WELL, WE SHOULD GET GOING THEN.
YEAH.
IT'S GETTING COLD FAST.
COME ON!
Announcer:
EVACUATION IS MANDATORY
IN MOST NORTHEAST COASTAL TOWNS.
WE'VE BEEN INFORMED,
FOLLOWING AN ONSITE EVALUATION,
THE PRESIDENT WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE
WITH THE MOST CURRENT UPDATE.
THE MILITARY CURRENTLY HAS AWAC IN THE AIR
ASSESSING THE THREAT.
DROPPING OUT AT 400.
TARGET IS BREAKING UP,
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
SAY AGAIN, JOHNNY BRAVO.
TARGET IS SEPARATING INTO MULTIPLE SECTIONS
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT
HEADING SOUTH DOWN THE COAST.
WOW.
CLOUD COVER'S JUST SO THICK,
IT LOOKS LIKE NIGHT.
I'M GETTING NOTHING.
I'M TRYING TO CALL HER BACK.
[BUSY SIGNAL]
LOOK, SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, OKAY?
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE OKAY.
[BUSY SIGNAL]
CAN'T GET HOLD OF THE SENATOR.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYBODY.
[BUSY SIGNAL]
DAD, YOU SAID THE PETERMANN GLACIER WAS HOW BIG?
LET'S SEE, THE LAST CALVING HAPPENED IN 2010.
THAT WAS ABOUT 100 SQUARE MILES,
WHICH IS ROUGHLY FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN,
AND THAT WAS ONLY 8% OF THE GLACIER.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S THE WHOLE GLACIER.
WITH ENOUGH SPEED, WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT COULD DO?
WHAT?
DAD!
[SHOUTING AND SCREAMING]
WHICH WAY'S YOUR ROOM?
THIS WAY.
COME ON.
KAREN!
OH, MY GOD, JULIA.
I CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYONE IN MAINE.
JUST TRY AGAIN, OKAY?
IT TOOK ME THREE TRIES.
KEEP TRYING.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
KEEP TRYING.
[THUNDER]
IS THERE A BASEMENT?
NO, THERE'D BE NO RECEPTION IN THE BASEMENT.
I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.
COME ON, JULIA!
NO, THAT'S A MISTAKE.
NO, JULIA, WE HAVE TO GO!
[GROANING AND CREAKING]
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HURRY!
PUT YOUR JACKET ON.
WE GOT TO GO.
BUT MY DAD SAID TO STAY HERE.
I KNOW.
CALL HIM AND TELL HIM,
BUT WE AREN'T STAYING HERE, JULIA!
MOM!
DAD!
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE!
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN WE--
I LOST THE SIGNAL.
YOU THINK THE MESSAGE WENT THROUGH?
I HOPE SO.
SO THEN WHAT NOW?
HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THE CITY?
EVERYTHING'S SHUT DOWN.
WE GET TO ONE OF THE BRIDGES AND GET ACROSS THE RIVER!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
JULIA, WHAT ABOUT THE SUBWAY?
THE SUBWAYS ARE SHUT DOWN, TOO.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIN, JULIA.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TUNNELS.
WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH ONE OF THOSE.
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'LL WORK?
WOULD YOU RATHER STAY UP HERE?
COME ON!
OH...
OH.
YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY, DAD.
YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE OKAY.
WE'LL WORK OUR WAY OUT.
COME ON.
NELSON'S OKAY.
WE'RE GOOD.
THE SUN IS BREAKING THROUGH.
COME ON.
EASY, EASY.
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST A CUT.
COME ON.
GET NELSON.
COME ON, SWEETIE.
NELSON?
YOU OKAY?
BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
BROKEN BONES?
NO.
ANYTHING?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, OKAY.
GOOD JOB.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE, DAD.
GOOD JOB.
OKAY, LET'S GET MOVING.
LET'S GO.
WE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.
KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CAR.
SEE IF THAT VAN WORKS.
OKAY, GUYS, COME ON.
[COUGH] COME ON.
Nelson:
SO COLD.
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.
OKAY, GUYS, GET IN.
GET IN, HONEY.
LOOK FOR SOME KEYS.
I'M GONNA CHECK THIS OUT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
IT'S SO COLD.
WHERE'S DAD GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.
HELLO?
HELLO?
WHERE'S DAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK, THOUGH, HONEY.
MOM, THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION.
OH, GOOD.
LET'S START IT.
[ENGINE WON'T START]
COME ON.
TRY AGAIN.
[ENGINE STARTS]
YES!
OKAY, GOOD.
IT'S A MESS IN HERE.
SMELLS LIKE SHIT.
OH, GOOD.
YOU GOT IT RUNNING.
YEAH.
OKAY, BAD NEWS.
THERE'S A BIG PILEUP.
WE GOT TO FIND A WAY--
[SNIFFING] WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I THINK IT'S MANURE OR SOMETHING.
IT SMELLS AWFUL.
MANURE?
LIKE FERTILIZER?
YEAH.
WHAT KIND?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HONEY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT.
EXCELLENT.
OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHERE'D HE GO?
[CRASH]
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE DAD COMES BACK SOON.
OKAY, INSIDE.
GO.
OKAY, HEADS DOWN.
HEADS DOWN.
HERE WE GO.
HEADS DOWN.
OKAY, WHY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.
WHAT KIND OF SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, BILL?
THE KIND THAT GOES BOOM.
SEE, WHEN YOU TAKE AMMONIUM NITRATE
AND YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIESEL FUEL, YOU GET...
WHOA!
DAD, WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO DO THAT?
IN SCIENCE CLASS.
[PHONE BEEPS]
OH, GOD, BILL.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION, I THINK.
I DO.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION.
PULL OVER.
PULL OVER RIGHT NOW!
MOM GOT A RECEPTION?
YEAH.
WELL?
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
IT'S JULIA.
WHERE WE GOING TO GO?
MOM, DAD, WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
NELSON, GET ON THE SHORTWAVE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL--
SOMETHING BAD HAS HIT HER DORM.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PLAYING IT AGAIN.
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
WE'RE NOT SAFE--
SOMETHING'S HIT THE DORM REALLY BAD AND SHE'S TRYING TO GET OUT.
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
SHE'S SAYING SHE CANNOT GET OUT OF NEW YORK CITY.
[EXPLOSION] WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?
IT'S A SONIC BOOM.
10 BIRDS IN FORMATION.
THEY'RE GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER.
CAN THEY DO THAT?
CAN THEY BOMB A GLACIER, BILL?
YEAH, THEY COULD DO THAT,
BUT THEY'D NEED TO HIT IT WITH A NUCLEAR BOMB
TO STOP THIS THING.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THEY SAID BOSTON'S GONNA BE HIT NEXT
IF THEY DON'T STOP IT.
BOSTON?
WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
OSCAR CHARLIE AND DELTA X-RAY APPROACHING TARGET.
ROGER, OSCAR CHARLIE.
ORDERING NUCLEAR PAYLOAD ACTIVE.
NUKES ARE HOT, WAITING FOR COUNTDOWN.
MY SON WAS BORN IN BOSTON, SO LET'S MELT THIS ICE.
ROGER THAT.
FIRE ONE!
OSCAR CHARLIE, DO YOU HAVE A VISUAL?
CHECKING NOW.
COMMAND 483.
NUKES DEPLOYED,
BUT THEY HAVE NO VISUAL EFFECT.
WAITING ON NEXT COMMAND.
EVERYONE LOOKS SO SCARED.
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
LOOK, WE GOT THIS BIG EMPTY VAN,
ALL THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP.
I FIGURE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL OPEN UP A DOOR--
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WE NEED TO GET HER, AND SHE IS OUR PRIORITY.
SHE'S OUR TOP PRIORITY, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
I FIGURE WE CAN HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE
RIDE WITH US TO NEW YORK.
IT'LL TAKE TWO MINUTES--
NO!
TWO MINUTES?
YEAH, TWO MINUTES.
HONEY, WE JUST CAN'T LEAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
HONEY?
MOM, DAD...
HEAR THAT?
EVERYBODY OKAY?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
I THINK WE MADE IT.
LET'S KEEP GOING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
BOSTON'S BEEN HIT!
THE GLACIER'S LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM US!
IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!
IT'S TOO LATE.
WE HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS NOT TO COME.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
ALL THE CIRCUITS ARE BUSY.
NO SURPRISE THERE.
KEEP IT ON.
WE'LL TRY AGAIN LATER.
WE GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
COME ON.
BABE, I KNOW WHERE WE ARE.
WE COULD TAKE A TUNNEL.
WE TRIED THEM ALL.
THEY'RE CLOSED!
TRUST ME!
GO, GO.
HURRY.
HURRY!
BE CAREFUL.
CAREFUL.
WE USED TO GO THIS WAY WHEN WE WERE, LIKE, 12.
JUST NEED TO FIND A LIGHT.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WE REALLY HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE?
YEAH.
IT'S SAFER THAN UP THERE.
OH, GOD.
WHAT IF MY PARENTS TRY TO MAKE IT TO NEW YORK?
THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOUR MESSAGE.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF--
THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE.
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIND SOME GAS SOON.
I CAN LOG ON AND FIND US A GAS STATION.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, HONEY.
POWER GRID IS DOWN, BUDDY.
THAT MEANS NO WI-FI, NO GAS STATIONS.
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
WE JUST NEED TO FIND HIM SOME FOOD
AND LET'S FIND SOME GAS.
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S JUST START LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.
DAD, LOOK!
YOU CAN SIPHON GAS.
GREAT IDEA.
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S START LOOKING FOR CARS,
HOPEFULLY FILLED WITH FOOD.
HANG IN THERE, NELSON.
WE'RE ALMOST IN NEW YORK, OKAY?
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN, BILL.
I THINK I SEE SOME CARS IN THE DISTANCE.
Nelson:
IT'S JUST SO CREEPY
WHEN IT GETS DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
HONEY, JUST GET WHAT WE NEED AND GET BACK.
BE CAREFUL.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S IN THERE.
JUST STAY THERE.
WHY?
JUST STAY THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.
I GOT THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO PEE.
OKAY.
[COUGHS]
I'M GLAD THAT WAS YOU AND NOT ME.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
IT'S WORKING.
THAT IS SOME STRONG STUFF.
WHEW!
HEY, WE'RE IN CONNECTICUT.
HONEY?
I'M NOT STOPPING.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.
HEY, NELSON, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO PULL UP ANYTHING ON THE GPS?
NOT REALLY.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT?
HAND 'EM OVER.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE BACK THERE, CHEF NELSON?
OH, MAN!
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU GUYS.
YEAH, SURE YOU WERE.
DINNER?
THANKS.
THANK YOU, HONEY.
NELSON, HOW MUCH LONGER TO NEW YORK?
ABOUT TWO HOURS.
YOU THINK SHE'S STILL AT THE DORM?
I'M SURE YOUR SISTER'S FINE.
SHE'S A SMART GIRL AND SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
IT'S THIS WAY.
YOU SURE WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN HERE IN 10 YEARS.
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN AND TRUST ME, OKAY?
IT'S THE ONLY WAY, JULIA.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING DEEPER, THOUGH.
[CREAKING]
WHAT WAS THAT?
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER IT IS, IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
COME ON.
[CREAKING AND GROANING]
WOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE.
COME ON.
LET'S KEEP MOVING.
Nelson:
DAD, I GOT A FREQUENCY.

THANK YOU.
YOU OKAY?
DO YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE?
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE.
SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
WE'RE ALMOST TO NEW YORK,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN.
WE'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN, OKAY?
OH, CRAP.
STAY HERE.
ARE WE IN NEW YORK?
NOT YET, HONEY.
NOT YET.
HEY!
HEY!
IS YOUR CAR WORKING?
NO, IT'S OUT OF GAS.
OH, GAS, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BUT YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU'RE STUCK, BUT YOU'RE OKAY, RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
RIGHT.
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
NO REASON.
HEY, HEY!
ARE YOU ALONE?
HEY, ARE YOU ALONE?
'CAUSE I'M ALONE.
I'M HERE WITH MY FAMILY.
OH, THAT'S COOL, THAT'S COOL.
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY COLD OUT HERE, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOMEPLACE WARM.
YEAH, I'D SAY FIND YOURSELF A CAR AND STAY INSIDE.
YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO.
I'LL GET A CAR.
I'LL GO TO CALIFORNIA.
YOU KNOW, HEY, I'LL GO TO THE BEACH
AND THE PRETTY BLONDE WOMEN.
MAYBE HAVE TEQUILAS ON THE BEACH.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.
NICE MEETING YOU.
NO, NO, HEY, HEY, HEY!
I'M THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND I COULD GO TO CALIFORNIA TOGETHER.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK.
OH, YEAH, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK'S REALLY COLD,
AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO GO SOMEPLACE THAT'S WARM.
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU, OKAY?
YOU GOT THAT?
EXCEPT YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE ME.

WE NEED TO GO TO CALIFORNIA.
JUST CALM DOWN.
I GOT MY FAMILY RIGHT THERE.
JUST CALM DOWN.
LOOK AT ME!
WE'RE GOING TO CALIFORNIA.
I GOT SOME MONEY.
THAT CAN HELP.
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
I GOT SOME FOOD IF YOU WANT SOME FOOD.
I DON'T WANT YOUR FOOD.
HEY, WHAT KIND OF FOOD YOU GOT?
I NEED TO GET INTO THE VAN.
YEAH, YEAH.
NO, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
NO, GO, GO, GO.

HEY, GARY.
YEAH, HEY.
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING MAYBE
I NEED TO GET IN THE CAR.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK, REMEMBER?
HERE'S YOUR FOOD.
NO, NO, NO.
I'M THINKING THAT
I SHOULD GET IN THE CAR WITH YOU GUYS.
NO, NO, NO.
HEY!
HEY!
HEY!
BILL, COME ON.
I'M NOT A BAD GUY.
I HEAR YOU.
NO, NO, I'M A GOOD GUY.
I'M A GREAT GUY.
I JUST WANT TO GO SOMEPLACE WARM, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN--HEY, HEY, KID, KID, KID, KID!
LOCK THE DOORS, NELSON, LOCK THE DOORS!
DAD, DO SOMETHING!
Teri:

Nelson:

OPEN THE DOOR!
OPEN THE DOOR!
LOCK THE DOORS, NELSON.
LOCK THE DOORS!
YOU GUYS THINK I'M KIDDING?
CALM DOWN, MAN.
THINK I'M JOKING AROUND?

YOUR WHOLE FRIGGING FAMILY IS DEAD!
ALL OF YOU ARE FRIGGING DEAD!

OPEN THE DOOR, KID.
Bill:

[SCREAMING]
THE ICE!
LET'S RUN!
WATCH OUT!
COME ON, GUYS.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
WE DID IT.
IT'S SNOWING AGAIN.
OKAY, LET'S GET ANOTHER VEHICLE.
LET'S TRY THIS WAY.
COME ON.
WHERE ARE WE?
IT'S THE LINCOLN TUNNEL.
WE CAN TAKE THIS ALL THE WAY TO NEW JERSEY.
AND HOW FAR IS THAT?
IT'S ABOUT A MILE.
COME ON.
Bill:
COME ON.
DAD, I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP GOING.
GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
IF WE STOP, WE DIE.
LET'S JUST GO.
HONEY, IS THAT A HOUSE?
SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.
COME ON.
CAN WE GO?
YEP, LET'S TRY IT.
COME ON.
IT'S SO COLD.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW, GUYS.
IT'S SO COLD.
HELLO!
HELLO!
COME ON IN, GUYS.
SIT DOWN.
GET WARM.
HELLO?
I DIDN'T SEE A CAR OUT FRONT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY LEFT HERE PRETTY QUICKLY.
HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE IF YOU FIND SOME CLOTHES,
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME FOOD,
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
HELLO?
HELLO?
[CRYING]
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU, JULIA.
HERE, HONEY, I FOUND THESE UPSTAIRS.
OH, GREAT.
HERE YOU GO.
SHOULD WE JUST LET HIM SLEEP?
NO, NO, NO.
WE GOT TO GET GOING.
IT MAY LOOK LIKE NIGHT,
BUT IT'S ONLY 3:00 P.M.
COME ON, WAKE UP, NELSON.
IT'S TIME TO GO.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE GOT TO DO IT ON FOOT.
GET GOING AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND ONE ON THE WAY.
HERE, HONEY.
SHH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HELLO?
WE'RE JUST HERE FOR SOME WARM CLOTHES.
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
THANK YOU!
WAIT!
WAIT!
MY DADDY'S HURT.
WESLEY, COME HERE.
OH, THANK GOD.
I THINK HE CAME THIS WAY.
OH.
I FOUND PEOPLE.
LISTEN TO ME.
DON'T YOU EVER LEAVE ME, OKAY?
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
CAN WE HELP?
YOU OKAY?
I WAS TRYING TO LOAD OUR TRUCK UP
AND THIS WHOLE THING FELL ON ME.
IT'S GOT MY LEG PINNED DOWN HERE.
OKAY, ON THE COUNT OF THREE, GUYS.
YOU READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE...
LET IT GO.
LET IT GO.
I THINK IF YOU LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP,
I CAN PROBABLY SHIMMY OUT.
OKAY, READY?
GOT IT?
OH, YEAH.
YOU GOT IT?
YOU CLEAR?
YEAH.
HERE.
GET UP.
DADDY, YOU'RE BLEEDING.
I'LL BE OKAY, SON.
MAN, THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME ALONG.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WE LOST OUR VAN AT THE RIVER
AND YOUR PLACE WAS THE FIRST PLACE WE CAME UPON.
I HAVE A VEST JUST LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THIS IS YOUR VEST.
WE KIND OF BROKE INTO YOUR PLACE.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE.
RELAX.
LOOK, ANYTHING YOU NEED HERE,
FEEL FREE TO HELP YOURSELF.
BESIDES, THIS PLACE ISN'T EVEN GONNA BE HERE IN A HOUR.
ARE WE GONNA FLY NOW?
NO, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE TRUCK, REMEMBER?
LOOK, YOU GUYS, WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM.
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
WHICH WAY YOU GUYS HEADED?
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HEAD WEST.
YEAH, WE'RE HEADED TO NEW YORK.
NEW YORK?
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE YOU WANT TO GO.
THIS ICEBERG IS CHEWING UP THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEW YORK.
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WELL, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
ME AND WESLEY, WE'RE GOING WEST.
HEY, IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?
MY DADDY CAN FLY.
SO CAN MINE.
DOES THIS STILL WORK?
SURE DOES.
ME AND WESLEY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN JAMAICA BY NOW,
BUT ONLY A FOOL WOULD GO UP IN THIS WEATHER.
GUYS, WE'RE ALL PACKED UP.
WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT.
YOU'RE STILL MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT I THINK I SHOULD GO
AND I'LL MEET YOU GUYS IN FLORIDA.
I AM NOT LEAVING YOU, EVER.
DAD, DAD, YOU NEED ME TO NAVIGATE.
OKAY.
GOOD LUCK.
YOU, TOO.
NELSON.
OKAY, NELSON, GET THIS OUT OF THE TARP.
LET'S GO.
BE CAREFUL.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE UNTIL THE GLACIER GETS HERE?
YOU HEAR THAT?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
NOT LONG.
LET'S GO.
COME ON!
GO!
THERE IT IS!
JERSEY!
COME ON, JULIA!
[SIRENS]
COME ON!
WE GOT TO GO!
ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
YOU READY?
ALL RIGHT, DAD!
[LAUGHS]
WE CAN PROBABLY BE IN NEW YORK IN 30 MINUTES.
JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS BUMPY RIDE.
THESE CLOUDS DON'T LOOK NORMAL.
Teri:
NOTHING LOOKS NORMAL.
IS THAT A TWISTER?
BILL, FLY US OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAN YOU FLY ABOVE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T WE HAVE A WEATHER DETECTION DEVICE?
I DON'T SEE ONE.
BILL, WE'RE FLYING RIGHT INTO THE THICK OF THAT.
HOLD ON!
DAD, YOU GOT TO GET US OUT OF HERE!
FLY HIGHER!
HIGHER, BILL!
HA HA!
AMAZING, DAD.
DAD!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
ARE THEY GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
Pilot:
EVERYTHING PROCEEDING PROPERLY, APPROACHING GLACIER.
ROGER THAT.
WE'RE AT THE OBSERVATION LOCATION.
WE'RE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 3-500 FEET
AND SIX MILES FROM LOCATION IMPACT.
WE NEED THE COORDINATES TO PLANT THE EXPLOSIONS.
ROGER THAT.
SENDING THEM NOW.
TEAMS FIVE AND SIX HAVE LANDED,
WAITING FOR SUPPLIES.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE DESCENDING NOW.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
AN HOUR TILL IMPACT.
AFFIRMATIVE?
63 MINUTES, MAJOR.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON, COME ON, GET IT, GO, GO!
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
HOW LONG UNTIL THE PAYLOAD DROP?
ARRIVING NOW.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON.
WE HAVE TO FIND SHELTER.
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS I'M IN JERSEY.
WE WILL.
COME ON.
CAN WE JUST STOP?
I'M TIRED.
NOT YET.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
HEY!
AAH!
AAH!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT!
HEY, LET HER GO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!
LET HIM GO!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT OR I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
STOP!
STOP!
Man:
NATIONAL GUARD!
STOP!
ARE YOU OKAY?
STOP!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING OUT HERE?
THIS CITY'S BEEN EVACUATED!
TO WHERE?
TO SHELTERS.
HELL, YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY I FOUND YOU.
I WAS ON MY LAST SWEEP.
LET'S GO!
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GLACIER?
ISN'T IT HEADED RIGHT FOR US?
NOT FOR LONG.
THERE'S A COMBINED TASKFORCE ON ITS WAY TO MEET IT.
SO YOU'VE DECLARED WAR ON A GLACIER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE LAST CHUNK OF THE GLACIER,
AND THEY'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ON IT.
NOW GET YOUR ASSES INSIDE BEFORE I HAVE YOU ARRESTED!
GO!
GO!
THAT'S THE LAST OF THE EXPLOSIVES, MAJOR.
GOOD, GOOD!
ALL EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED.
ROGER THAT.
THE CHARGES ARE IN PLACE!
TAKE US BACK HOME!
COPY THAT.
PREPARE FOR EXTRACTION.
ROGER THAT.
HEY, NELSON.
GRAB THE COMPUTER.
I WANT TO FIND OUT
IF WE CAN CONNECT TO A SATELLITE AT THIS ALTITUDE.
GOT IT.
SHOULD TAKE A SEC.
RECEPTION BLOWS UP HERE.
I GOT A SIGNAL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO CONNECT UP TO THE NOAA WEBSITE.
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT GLACIER IS RIGHT NOW.
GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE LOGIN?
LOGIN IS USERNAME JULIA,
PASSWORD, NELSON.
DAD, THAT'S LAME.
THAT IS SWEET.
LAME OR NOT, OPEN UP THE TRACKING PROGRAM.
NOW RUN THE SIMULATION WITH THE SAME COORDINATES,
BUT PUT IN OUR GPS LOCATION RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW FAR AWAY WE ARE FROM THAT GLACIER.
OKAY, IT'S 50 MILES BEHIND US.
IT'S MOVING AT 200 MILES AN HOUR.
WHAT?
HOW CAN A GLACIER MOVE AT 200 MILES PER HOUR?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE DOES EITHER.
CAN WE OUTRUN THAT?
ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT ON TIME?
LET'S FIND OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WE'RE ICING UP.
DOESN'T THIS MODEL HAVE DE-ICERS?
NO.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FLY LOW IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
WE'RE BURNING FUEL LIKE CRAZY.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK OUTSIDE
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY KIND OF PRIVATE AIRFIELD,
A CROP DUSTING OPERATION, ANYTHING.
YOU GUYS FINDING ANYTHING?
HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM NEW YORK?
CAN'T BE MORE THAN 100 MILES.
YOU GUYS SEEING ANYTHING?
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
THIS VISIBILITY SUCKS BALLS.
NELSON!
OKAY, GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE GONNA GO LOWER.
ANYTHING?
NOPE, NOTHING.
WE'RE STILL COLLECTING A LOT OF ICE.
I MAY HAVE TO PUT HER DOWN AT ANY TIME, GUYS.
HOW MUCH MORE ICE CAN THIS THING TAKE?
NOT A LOT.
THESE HEADWINDS ARE KILLING US.
WE COULD WALK THERE FASTER.
HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT?
ABOUT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.
I'M GONNA TRY TO LAND HER AT NEWARK OR LA GUARDIA.
WILL THEY ALLOW US TO LAND WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN?
WELL, I'LL JUST RADIO AHEAD
AND TELL THEM WE'RE AN EMERGENCY.
THEY HAVE TO LET US LAND.
WHAT IF THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HEAR US?
OH, CRAP!
Teri:
WHAT?
WE JUST RAN OUT OF FUEL IN THE RIGHT FUEL TANK!
OKAY, GUYS, STRAP YOURSELVES IN.
GET READY.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING.
REALLY, BILL?
YES!
GET READY!
GOD, LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
WELL, AT LEAST WE GET FREE COOKIES.
YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND US?
I HOPE SO.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?
DAD'S IN NORTHERN EUROPE NEAR OSLO.
IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST HIT.
IT'S OKAY.
I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU.
OKAY, YOU GUYS.
WE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LAND,
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO NEWARK.
WE'RE ENTERING INTO THE NEW YORK AIR CORRIDOR NOW.
I'M GONNA GET ON THE RADIO
AND SEE IF ANYBODY'S THERE LISTENING.
GIVE ME THE RADIO THERE, NELSON.
NEWARK TOWER, THIS IS CESSNA...
WHERE'S THE FLIGHT NUMBER?
GIVE ME THE FLIGHT NUMBER.
THIS IS CESSNA NUMBER NOVEMBER NINER, NINER, 7-2-5.
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
DO YOU COPY?
CAN THEY EVEN HEAR US?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND A HOLE AND SLIP INTO IT.
BUCKLE UP, GUYS.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE GROUND
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, SO HOLD ON.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK AROUND
TO SEE IF YOU CAN SEE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT
THAT MIGHT BE LANDING WITHOUT TOWER PERMISSION, OKAY?
BRACE YOURSELVES!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH?
OKAY.
WE'RE DOWN.
OKAY, OKAY.
LET'S GET OUT, GUYS.
COME ON.
COME ON OUT.
COME ON, GUYS.
HERE WE GO.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WELL, I GUESS WE GOT OUT JUST IN TIME.
HEY, GUYS, LOOK.
IT'S NEW YORK.
WE DID IT!
ALMOST THERE.
YEAH. [LAUGHS]
DID YOU CRASH THAT ONE EIGHTY?
YEAH.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I GOT ALL THE INSURANCE INFORMATION IF YOU NEED IT.
IF A CRASHED CESSNA WAS ALL WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT,
I'D CALL IT A GOOD DAY.
COME WITH ME.
LET'S GET YOU INTO SOMEPLACE SAFE.
COLONEL SINOR, THIS IS COMMAND.
WE ARE LESS THAN 30 SECONDS FROM DETONATION.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE ALL CLEAR AND STANDING BY.
GIVE ME A LONG COUNT, CAPTAIN.
FIRE!
[LAUGHS]
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
WERE YOU GUYS HEADED INTO MANHATTAN?
YEAH, BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR DAUGHTER.
I'M SORRY.
NO ONE'S GETTING IN AND OUT OF NEW YORK ALIVE.
JUST STAY HERE.
THE NATIONAL GUARD'S GONNA BE HERE TO GET YOU.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT--
OH!
OH!
COME ON, GET BACK!
GET BACK!
WE JUST GOT TO STAY AWAY FROM TALL BUILDINGS
WITH LOTS OF GLASS, GOT IT?
DAD, WE'RE GOING TO MANHATTAN.
POINT TAKEN.
SO HOW WE GONNA GET THERE?
WE GOT TO GET OURSELVES ANOTHER CAR
AND THEN JUST DRIVE INTO THE CITY.
AND GO WHERE?
TO THE DORM.
THE DORM?
SHE'S NOT AT THE DORM AND YOU KNOW THAT.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE SHE GOT OUR MESSAGE.
WHAT, TO GO TO FLORIDA?
LOOK, SHE MAY NOT BE IN NEW YORK,
BUT WE HAVE START THERE.
FROM THERE, MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
SOME SORT OF CLUE WHERE SHE--
ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE?
HEY, GUYS!
ARE WE GOING OR WHAT?
WERE THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.
LET'S JUST GO.
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET HOLD OF HER AGAIN.
IF WE'RE IN JERSEY, HOW FAR IS NEW YORK?
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER.
WE'RE COMING UP TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.
NO SIGNAL.
IT JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY NOW.
IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH.
WE JUST NEED TO GET UNDER THE GW.
I'LL TRY TO GET THE GPS RUNNING.
IS EVERYONE TRYING TO GET TO NEW YORK?
LOOK AT THAT MESS.
NELSON, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO THE BRIDGE.
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN YOUR CAR AROUND.
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH HERE.
WE HAVE TO GET TO MANHATTAN.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE'S GOING OVER THERE.
NO, OUR DAUGHTER IS THERE, AND WE NEED TO PICK HER UP.
I DON'T CARE IF THE POPE'S OVER THERE.
NO ONE'S GOING IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER SOON ANYWAY.
PLEASE JUST LET US GO.
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.
WASHINGTON BRIDGE, IT'S OUT.
WOW!
THE AIR FORCE IS COMING IN FOR THEIR LAST AIR STRIKE.
LET'S HOPE THAT DOES IT,
OR MAYBE NONE OF US WILL GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW, BILL?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THINKING SOMETHING.
WHAT?
OH, IT'S JUST THAT
REMEMBER WHEN THE KIDS WERE REALLY, REALLY YOUNG
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE COULD PUT
SOME SORT OF TRACKING DEVICE ON THEM,
WE'D ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE INVENTED THAT DEVICE.
DAMN IT!
WAIT, WAIT, GUYS!
WE DO HAVE A TRACKING DEVICE!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, NELSON?
OH, OF COURSE!
OF COURSE WHAT?
EVEN IF WE CAN'T TALK TO HER ON HER PHONE,
WE CAN TRACK HER PHONE.
REALLY?
WE CAN DO THAT?
YES.
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?
DON'T ASK.
I GOT IT!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
NEW JERSEY?
SHE'S HERE!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
OH, MY GOD, BILL.
WHERE?
UM...
FOUR MILES THAT WAY.
TWO MORE MILES.
HURRY, BILL!
OKAY, PEOPLE, THIS IS IT!
STAY BACK.
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT--
HOW FAR ARE WE?
1.7 MILES.
WHICH WAY DO WE GO?
THERE'S GONNA BE A DEAD END ON YOUR LEFT,
SO WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT.
OKAY, GUYS, HERE WE GO.
HOLD ON A SECOND!
T MINUS 2 MINUTES FOR LAUNCH.
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH THIS.
HOW FAR AWAY IS SHE?
DAD, SHE'S JUST TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
OKAY, WE'RE GOING ON FOOT, GUYS.
COME ON.
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S THE GPS SAY?
SHE'S THAT WAY!
ONE MORE BLOCK THIS WAY!
JUST OVER A BLOCK!
OH!
DAD, MY PHONE!
GOT TO GET MY PHONE TO FIND HER!
NELSON, LISTEN TO ME.
WE'LL FIND HER.
FORGET IT, FORGET IT!
WE DON'T HAVE TIME!
LET'S GO.
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!

LOOK!
WHAT THE HELL?
THAT'S MY DAD.
JULIA!
DAD!
DAD!
JULIA!
DADDY!
I GOT HER!
LET'S GO!
DADDY!
OH, JULIA, ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M FINE.
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, MY GOD.
OH, THANK GOD.
OH, BABY.
HI, BABY.
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
WE GOT HER.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET ME SEE YOU.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
DAD, THIS IS LOGAN.
HI, LOGAN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GET TO SAFETY, GUYS.
COME ON.
Nelson:
DAD, DRIVE!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
THE BRIDGES ARE DOWN, STREETS ARE BLOCKED, THE RIVER'S FROZEN.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
DADDY?
Logan:
ARE YOU DRIVING ON THE HUDSON RIVER?
IS IT GONNA HOLD?
Nelson:
IT DIDN'T LAST TIME.
Julia:
LAST TIME?
WHAT?
Nelson:
YOU SEE THAT?
THOSE ARE F-16s GOING IN!
Teri:
WHAT WAS THAT?
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING BIG JUST BLEW UP.
Teri:
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE CANNOT KEEP GOING ON LIKE THIS!
I KNOW!
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY OFF THE RIVER!
ANY IDEAS?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
OKAY, IF WE CAN MAKE IT.
GLACIER APPEARS TO BE BREAKING UP.
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT!
LET'S GO!
OKAY, GO ON THROUGH!
COME ON THROUGH!
LET'S GO!
NO, NO, NO, FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS!
KEEP GOING!
HURRY!
OKAY, GET DOWN.
GET DOWN.
HONEY.
HEAR ANYTHING?
NO.
IS IT DONE?
HOLD ON.
COME ON.
COME ON UP.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
OH.
Blue team to base camp.
Go, blue team.
Are you getting this?
The seismic activity seems to be increasing exponentially.
I'm heading north on the shelf to collect more data.
Copy.
Blue team, reports show... the Hekla volcano is having immense seismic readings.
Proceed with caution.
Copy that.
Base camp, we're seeing intense magna flow... running up and down the range.
If it keeps increasing, we may have to evacuate the area now.
All the local areas.
Base camp, if the whole range starts erupting,
We're looking at a whole glacier detaching from the shelf.
[Horns honking]
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Can I really talk to base on this thing?
Oh, absolutely.
I talk to them all the time.
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Try a lower band.
There you go.
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
[Sighs] Just can't get it.
There's too much interference.
I'm going to take down a plane with this thing.
Better not.
Hey, did you pack your gortex?
Hello?
Julia?
Julia?
Unbelievable.
You heard me a second ago.
Mom packed it.
Well, good, I'm glad.
You know, it gets cold in New York, Julia.
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Summit camp, come in.
Dad, I think i just got 'em.
Oh, great.
6SNL7, come in.
Dad, I'm gonna miss my flight!
Hold on.
Dad, this is my terminal.
Dad!
6SNL7, come in.
This is summit camp.
Go ahead.
Divya?
Hey, I wanted to let you know... that I'm bringing some new instruments next week.
Bill, have you looked at the data we sent?
No, no, no.
I'm not in the office.
I'm dropping Julia off at the airport.
- Why?
What's up?
- We're evacuating.
The rest of the team is gone already.
I'm the last man standing.
Evacuating?
Why?
Dad, I should just walk from here.
Hekla went berserk.
There's a huge pressure buildup.
The endurance readings are off the chart.
The entire Hekla line is erupting.
There is pressure building up everywhere.
Bill, I've never seen anything like this.
Pressure building up where?
At what site?
I'm trying.
Guys, hold on.
We're seeing activity across the entire range.
Wait, at all the sites?
That doesn't make any sense, Divya.
I checked with the other stations.
No one's ever seen anything like this.
I sent you everything we got
Before the centers melted down, Bill.
Look at the data!
No, I'm not at the office.
I'll be there in an hour.
Pull up the computer simulation.
Divya, can you read me?
Divya?
[Horns honking]
Okay, I'm going back to school now.
No need to say goodbye or anything.
Reykjanes ridge?
Yeah.
Divya, are you there?
Magna flow rate?
F7.
Divya, can you read me?
Right, I'll be back around christmastime
Unless I decide to stay in New York forever.
Divya, come in.
Divya, if you can still hear me,
I will look at the data... and I will contact you... as soon as I get to the office.
Divya, are you there?
6SNL7, come in.
5-3-7-6-E-9.
6SNL7, do you copy?
Sir, you're going to need to move your car.
It's fine.
I'm just dropping my daughter off.
We'll be two minutes.
6SNL7, do you read?
Sir?
Oh, my god.
Come in, 6SNL7.
Do you read?
Sir, you're gonna have to move your car.
Sir?
Hart, do you read me?
Yes, go ahead, Divya.
I read you.
Go ahead.
I can't believe what's happening!
The entire range is on fire!
Sir, this is a no parking zone.
This is loading and unloading only.
I need you to move your...
This is massive!
What's happening?
The entire range is on fire!
Every single volcano is erupting!
Say again.
I couldn't understand.
The entire ice shelf is fracturing!
It's 1,000 miles long!
Bill, do you read me?
[Alarm beeps]
[Static]
Something about the volcano.
Is not moving.
Dad, we need to go.
Look.
Yeah.
Where's Julia?
She left, like, two minutes ago.
What?
Ah, crap.
You want me to drive, dad?
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just can't believe I missed her.
I can't believe I didn't say goodbye to your sister.
Mom's gonna kill you.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Dad, what is Dr. Chandra saying about the glacier?
Did it calf?
Well, it's possible,
But it sounded a lot bigger than that.
That would be sick.
Sick, huh?
100%.
Why don't you bring up the simulation again... on the parameter screen, okay?
Okay, let's see.
Okay, using these numbers,
See what you can come up with... for the ice flow projection, okay?
I'll be right back.
Roy?
Bill?
What're you doing here?
I thought you were out in the field.
I just spoke with Divya,
And he had sent you some data.
Did you receive it?
Yeah, the Hekla volcano just erupted.
No, but it sounded more than the Hekla, like the whole range went up.
We know.
Hart, go home.
We've got this.
I could be pulling maps or crunching numbers.
Why are you trying to send me home?
Bill, we don't need you.
Roy, look, we've been friends for 15 years.
What the hell's going on here?
Bill, I have just put Cynthia and my kids... on a plane to Mexico.
You do the same.
We have got chunks of ice... falling all over Canada.
In 19 hours, the bulk of the glacier... is going to hit North America.
Bill, get your family out now.
What did you get?
It won't let me input this data.
Okay.
Well, let's open up a terminal window... and we'll enter sandbox mode.
What's that?
Well, it's a mode that allows you... to enter in variables that are theoretically impossible.
What does that mean?
It means we gotta get your mom.
Why?
Right now.
I'll tell you on the way.
Hold on.
Excuse me, senator.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
But I just got off the phone with Cyrus... over Atmair traffic services, and he said that all the flights are grounded... because of the volcanic ash flow.
Get Quincy in DC and ask him... if they're gonna postpone the summit.
Yes, senator.
Hey.
Your daughter's flying out today.
Yes.
Starting college.
NYU.
Teri, these volcanoes are in Greenland.
Julia's flying into New York.
She'll be fine.
I hope so.
I'm sure you're right, sir.
Thank you.
Teri?
Teri?
Teri?
Bill, what are you doing here?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to Julia?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to Julia?
No, no.
Julia is fine.
Everything's fine.
Okay, thank you.
Please don't scare me like that.
What are you doing here?
I was talking to Divya about the Petermann glacier.
Divya?
Petermann?
What is that?
Hi, Bill.
Hi, senator.
Is everything all right with Julia?
Everything's fine with Julia, senator.
Sorry to disturb you.
But you need to leave town right now, sir.
Bill!
Bill was just leaving, senator.
So sorry to disturb you.
Look, there is a huge glacier coming our way,
And it's coming at us really, really quick.
We gotta get outta town!
Listen, I have a summit meeting.
No, no, no.
I understand.
Mom, mom!
This is true!
We have to get out of Maine.
Really?
You're gonna bring our son into all your weather...
It's true!
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.
Hi, Josh.
Hi.
Hey, Bill.
I can't seem to get anybody... on the phone about the summit.
Not even the white house is picking up.
You'd better be right about this.
Josh, go home.
What?
No, don't go home.
Get out of Maine.
Go as far south as you can!
What's going on?
[Teri]:
Don't scare him like that!
Eagle Cliff, flight deck.
Requesting sat-com coordinates.
Over.
Hold for GPS.
Glacier located.
58-42 north, 39-02 west,
Bearing 210.
Over.
Copy that.
Eagle Cliff flight deck clear.
Foxtrot, whiskey, 8-7-0 clear to take off.
Roger, I'm getting a visual now.
This is Foxtrot, Whiskey, 8-7-0.
It's heading towards Newfoundland.
Why is it getting darker?
The weather's changing.
Dad, are your headlights on?
Give me your phone.
I need to call Julia.
Can we go home first?
I need to get my laptop.
We have to get out of town.
[Telephone ringing]
She's not picking up.
I don't understand this.
Don't they have Wi-Fi on airplanes?
Maybe if she was flying first class.
She shouldn't have even been flying at all today.
Not today.
Don't worry.
She's gonna be landing soon.
We'll get hold of her.
It'll be okay.
Whoa.
Use words, Nelson.
I don't think I can.
What?
Well, we're not going back home.
Why not?
Don't have enough time.
Look at the clouds.
What can do that?
Glaciers.
Really, really fast glaciers.
Okay, so where we going?
New York.
Take us about 7, 8 hours.
Hey.
Hey!
[Laughs]
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Sorry it took me so long.
Traffic was a mess.
I know.
They grounded all the flights.
They did?
- Damn.
- Mm-Hmm.
Guess we're gonna be here a while, huh?
Well, that's not such a bad thing.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
[Cell phone buzzes]
Oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
Who's that?
No one.
Let's go back to the dorm and fool around.
All right.
Sounds good to me.
Julia, we're on our way to New York.
We're gonna meet you at your dorm, okay, honey?
So when you get to the dorm, just stay there, all right?
We're gonna meet you there.
All right, big hugs, and love you.
Love you, love you, love you.
Bye.
Are you sure that New York is safe?
Bill?
How stupid.
Why don't we just have her fly and meet us down in Florida?
Sweetheart, everything is grounded.
I say we stay on plan... and we just meet her at the dorm.
Fine.
Oh, my gosh!
It's okay, it's okay.
We're okay.
Dad, I think it's coming faster than we thought!
Have you ever seen this?
No.
The glaciers are making it snow in Maine?
It's summer.
Can you just get us out of Maine now?
How big do these glaciers have to be to do this?
Bill?
[Horns honking]
Crap.
Dad, does this snow mean the glacier's getting close?
Bill, it has to because the clouds are looking massive.
I bet this glacier is enormous,
Like the whole shelf.
Yeah.
Okay, here's what we got to do.
I got to find a way around this traffic.
Nelson, jump on the GPS and find me an alternate route.
On it.
Bill, get us out of here now!
We don't know if the glacier is close.
Those military planes?
F-16s.
Nelson, focus.
GPS.
Target is 400 miles off the Northeast coast... and is now in range.
Sir, I don't see anything.
Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you.
Negative, Alpha Foxtrot.
I see nothing.
Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you.
Negative, Alpha Foxtrot.
There is nothing.
Delta Bravo One, look again.
Holy sh...
Pull up!
Pull up!
Pull up!
Delta Bravo One, do you read me?
Delta Bravo One?
Alpha Foxtrot, this is control.
Fire sequence in 3... 2... 1... fire!
Oh, my god!
Dad, get us out of here!
Is everybody okay?
Is it gone?
I don't know.
I don't see anything.
I think we outran it.
What do you think, Bill?
Do you think it's gone?
I just don't know.
Maybe we should just pull over.
No, not yet, not yet.
Everything is gone, isn't it?
Just don't even think about it, all right, Nelson?
Everything.
God, my friends.
I need to get online!
No, no.
You need to focus on what's important, okay?
This is important!
No, this is not important!
[Cell phone rings]
Mom, your cell phone.
It's Julia.
Julia?
Julia!
Mom!
Oh, my god.
Is everyone okay?
We're fine.
We're fine.
Dad's here and Nelson's here.
[Julia]:
What happened?
We don't know.
The news is saying that Bangor just got destroyed.
Tell her we're coming to New York.
We're coming to New York.
[Nelson]:
Mom, can I just talk to her?
Tell her that we'll be at her dorm... in six hours from now.
We're gonna be at your dorm in six hours, okay?
Can you hear me?
Julia?
Julia?
[Static]
Hello?
Let me talk to her.
Julia, listen.
If the weather breaks, head south to Florida... to your aunt Kissy's house.
The further south you go, the safer it is.
Julia?
Hello?
Julia?
Hello?
Sweetheart, if you can...
[breaking up]
Mom?
Lost it.
Dad, I wanted to talk to her.
Sorry, buddy.
Well, what?
My parents are coming for me.
I think they want us to stay at the dorm.
Well, we should get going then.
Yeah.
It's getting cold fast.
Come on!
[Announcer]:
Evacuation is mandatory... in most Northeast coastal towns.
We've been informed, following an onsite evaluation, the president will hold a press conference... with the most current update.
The military currently has Awac in the air... assessing the threat.
Dropping out at 400.
Target is breaking up, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference.
Say again, Johnny Bravo.
Target is separating into multiple sections... and there's still a lot... heading south down the coast.
Wow.
Cloud cover's just so thick, it looks like night.
I'm getting nothing.
I'm trying to call her back.
[Busy signal]
Look, she's gonna be okay, okay?
We're gonna be okay.
We're all gonna be okay.
[Busy signal]
Can't get hold of the senator.
Can't get hold of anybody.
[Busy signal]
Dad, you said the Petermann glacier was how big?
Let's see, the last calving happened in 2010.
That was about 100 square miles,
Which is roughly four times the size of Manhattan,
And that was only 8% of the glacier.
This sounds like it's the whole glacier.
With enough speed, who knows how much damage it could do?
What?
Dad!
[Shouting and screaming]
Which way's your room?
This way.
Come on.
Karen!
Oh, my god, Julia.
I can't get hold of anyone in Maine.
Just try again, okay?
It took me three tries.
Keep trying.
Right, right.
Keep trying.
[Thunder]
Is there a basement?
No, there'd be no reception in the basement.
I'm gonna keep trying.
Come on, Julia!
No, that's a mistake.
No, Julia, we have to go!
[Groaning and creaking]
What was that?
I don't know.
Hurry!
Put your jacket on.
We gotta go.
But my dad said to stay here.
I know.
Call him and tell him,
But we aren't staying here, Julia!
Mom!
Dad!
We're not staying here.
The dorms aren't safe!
I'll give you a call when we...
I lost the signal.
You think the message went through?
I hope so.
So then what now?
How do we get outta the city?
Everything's shut down.
We get to one of the bridges and get across the river!
Wait, wait, wait!
Julia, what about the subway?
The subways are shut down, too.
I'm not talking about the train, Julia.
I'm talking about the tunnels.
We can make it through one of those.
You really think that'll work?
Would you rather stay up here?
Come on!
Oh... oh.
You okay?
I'm okay, dad.
Yeah, yeah.
We're okay.
We'll work our way out.
Come on.
Nelson's okay.
We're good.
The sun is breaking through.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
You okay?
You all right?
You're bleeding.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's just a cut.
Come on.
Get Nelson.
Come on, sweetie.
Nelson?
You okay?
Baby, you all right?
Okay.
Broken bones?
No.
Anything?
Okay.
All right, guys, okay.
Good job.
I love you so much.
It's gonna be all right.
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, dad.
- Good job.
Okay, let's get moving.
Let's go.
We got to get away from the car.
Keep going.
Come on.
We need to find another car.
See if that van works.
Okay, guys, come on.
[Cough] Come on.
[Nelson]:
So cold.
There's no one here.
Okay, guys, get in.
Get in, honey.
Look for some keys.
I'm gonna check this out.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
Where's dad going?
I don't know.
He'll be back.
Give me your hands.
Hello?
Hello?
Where's dad?
I don't know.
He'll be back, though, honey.
Mom, the keys are in the ignition.
Oh, good.
Let's start it.
[Engine won't start]
Come on.
Try again.
[Engine starts]
Yes!
Okay, good.
It's a mess in here.
Smells like shit.
Oh, good.
You got it running.
Yeah.
Okay, bad news.
There's a big pileup.
We gotta find a way...
[Sniffing] What's that smell?
I think it's manure or something.
It smells awful.
Manure?
Like fertilizer?
Yeah.
What kind?
I don't know.
What're you doing, honey?
Just a little science project.
Excellent.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Where'd he go?
[Crash]
What was that?
I don't know.
I hope dad comes back soon.
Okay, inside.
Go.
Okay, heads down.
Heads down.
Here we go.
Heads down.
Okay, why?
Just a little science experiment.
What kinda science experiment, Bill?
The kind that goes boom.
See, when you take ammonium nitrate... and you had a little bit of diesel fuel, you get...
Whoa!
Dad, where'd you learn to do that?
In science class.
[Phone beeps]
Oh, god, Bill.
I have phone reception, I think.
I do.
I have phone reception.
Pull over.
Pull over right now!
Mom got a reception?
Yeah.
Well?
Mom, dad, it's Julia.
It's Julia.
Where we going to go?
Mom, dad, we're not staying here.
Nelson, get on the shortwave.
The dorms aren't safe.
I'll give you a call...
Something bad has hit her dorm.
What happened?
I don't know.
I'm playing it again.
Mom, dad, it's Julia.
We're not safe...
Something's hit the dorm really bad and she's trying to get out.
We're not staying here.
The dorms aren't safe.
She's saying she cannot get out of New York city.
- [Explosion]
- What the heck was that?
It's a sonic boom.
10 birds in formation.
They're gonna go bomb the glacier.
Can they do that?
Can they bomb a glacier, Bill?
Yeah, they could do that, but they'd need to hit it with a nuclear bomb... to stop this thing.
That's what they're doing.
They said Boston's gonna be hit next...
If they don't stop it.
Boston?
We have gotta get to New York City right now.
We gotta get out of here.
Oscar Charlie and Delta X-Ray approaching target.
Roger, Oscar Charlie.
Ordering nuclear payload active.
Nukes are hot, waiting for countdown.
My son was born in Boston, so let's melt this ice.
Roger that.
Fire one!
Oscar Charlie, do you have a visual?
Checking now.
Command 483.
Nukes deployed, but they have no visual effect.
Waiting on next command.
Everyone looks so scared.
Why are we stopping?
Look, we got this big empty van, all these people need help.
I figure, you know, we'll open up a door...
Our daughter's in New York.
We need to get her, and she is our priority.
She's our top priority, and we're on our way to New York.
I figure we can have a couple people... ride with us to New York.
It'll take two minutes...
No!
Two minutes?
Yeah, two minutes.
Honey, we just can't leave people out there.
Honey?
Mom, dad... hear that?
Everybody okay?
I don't hear anything.
I think we made it.
Let's keep going.
What happened?
Boston's been hit!
The glacier's less than an hour from us!
It's headed right for us!
It's too late.
We have to tell my parents not to come.
[Telephone ringing]
All the circuits are busy.
No surprise there.
Keep it on.
We'll try again later.
We got to keep moving.
Come on.
Babe, I know where we are.
We could take a tunnel.
We tried them all.
They're closed!
Trust me!
Go, go.
Hurry.
Hurry!
Be careful.
Careful.
We used to go this way when we were, like, 12.
Just need to find a light.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
We really have to go down there?
Yeah.
It's safer than up there.
Oh, god.
What if my parents try to make it to New York?
They're going to get your message.
Yeah, but what if...
They'll get the message.
Hey, guys, we're gonna need to find some gas soon.
I can log on and find us a gas station.
I don't think that's gonna happen, honey.
Power grid is down, buddy.
That means no Wi-Fi, no gas stations.
I'm really hungry.
We just need to find him some food... and let's find some gas.
All right?
Let's just start looking for something.
Dad, look!
You can siphon gas.
Great idea.
Okay, guys, let's start looking for cars,
Hopefully filled with food.
Hang in there, Nelson.
We're almost in New York, okay?
Slow down, slow down, Bill.
I think I see some cars in the distance.
[Nelson]:
It's just so creepy... when it gets dark in the middle of the day.
Honey, just get what we need and get back.
Be careful.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if anyone's in there.
Just stay there.
Why?
Just stay there.
All right.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
I can do this.
I got this.
All right.
I'm gonna go pee.
Okay.
[Coughs]
I'm glad that was you and not me.
Yeah, me, too.
It's working.
That is some strong stuff.
Whew!
Hey, we're in Connecticut.
Honey?
I'm not stopping.
It's pitch black.
Hey, Nelson, have you been able... to pull up anything on the GPS?
Not really.
Are you kidding me?
What?
Hand 'em over.
Unbelievable.
You got anything else back there, chef Nelson?
Oh, man!
I was gonna tell you guys.
Yeah, sure you were.
Dinner?
Thanks.
Thank you, honey.
Nelson, how much longer to New York?
About two hours.
You think she's still at the dorm?
I'm sure your sister's fine.
She's a smart girl and she can take care of herself.
It's this way.
You sure we're going the right way?
I mean, you haven't been down here in 10 years.
You have to calm down and trust me, okay?
It's the only way, Julia.
It feels like we're going deeper, though.
[Creaking]
What was that?
Oh, god, I don't know.
Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good.
Come on.
[Creaking and groaning]
Wow.
It sounds like it's getting worse.
Come on.
Let's keep moving.
[Nelson]:
Dad, I got a frequency.
[Radio broadcast breaking up]
Go Henry. 11-41 and 44th and... intersection.
[Transmission breaking up] 10-4...
LB.
AJ4-LB.
Turn to channel 3 for further details.
Copy that.
Thank you.
You okay?
Do you want me to drive?
You know, i didn't say goodbye.
She got out of the car
And I didn't even know it.
We're almost to New York,
And you're gonna get to see her again.
We're gonna get to see her again, okay?
Oh, crap.
Stay here.
Are we in New York?
Not yet, honey.
Not yet.
Hey!
Hey!
Is your car working?
No, it's out of gas.
Oh, gas, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But you're cool with that, right?
I mean, you're stuck, but you're okay, right?
Yeah, yeah, we'll figure it out.
Right.
Are you okay?
Why do you say that?
No reason.
Hey, hey!
Are you alone?
Hey, are you alone?
'Cause I'm alone.
I'm here with my family.
Oh, that's cool, that's cool.
Hey, you know, it's really cold out here, right?
I mean, I should probably get someplace warm.
Yeah, I'd say find yourself a car and stay inside.
Yeah, yeah, no, no.
I'll get a car.
I'll go to California.
You know, hey, I'll go to the beach... and the pretty blonde women.
Maybe have tequilas on the beach.
That sounds like a good plan.
Nice meeting you.
No, no, hey, hey, hey!
I'm thinking that, you know,
You and I could go to California together.
No, we're going to New York.
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, yeah.
But, you know, New York's really cold, and, you know, we need to go someplace that's warm.
Look, I'm not gonna go anywhere with you, okay?
You got that?
Except you're not gonna leave me.
Again, you go.
We need to go to California.
Just calm down.
I got my family right there.
Just calm down.
Look at me!
We're going to California.
I got some money.
That can help.
I don't want your money.
I got some food if you want some food.
I don't want your food.
Hey, what kind of food you got?
I need to get into the van.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, no, yeah.
No, go, go, go.
Get in.
Nelson, give me a bag of chips.
Bill?
Bill, hey, hey.
Your name is Bill.
Bill, hey, I'm Gary.
I'm gary Morganson.
Hey, Gary.
Yeah, hey.
You know, I'm thinking maybe...
I need to get in the car.
No, we're going to New York, remember?
Here's your food.
No, no, no.
I'm thinking that
I should get in the car with you guys.
No, no, no.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Bill, come on.
I'm not a bad guy.
I hear you.
No, no, I'm a good guy.
I'm a great guy.
I just wanna go someplace warm, you know?
I mean...
Hey, hey, kid, kid, kid, kid!
Lock the doors, Nelson, lock the doors!
Dad, do something!
[Teri]:
Bill, get us out of here now!
[Bill]:
I can't we're blocked in.
[Nelson]:
My sister's in New York!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Lock the doors, Nelson.
Lock the doors!
You guys think I'm kidding?
Calm down, man.
Think I'm joking around?
You're dead.
You're dead!
Your whole frigging family is dead!
All of you are frigging dead!
You're dead!
Open the door, kid.
[Bill]:
Everybody out.
Come on.
Come on, Teri, out.
Get out, Nelson.
Get out.
Go with your dad.
[Nelson]:
What're we supposed to do?
Follow your dad, Nelson.
Nelson, over here.
He has the radio gear!
Nelson, don't do it!
No!
No, Nelson!
Nelson, come back!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson, what the hell were you doing?
I got it!
I got it!
Don't ever do that again!
Please.
Oh, god!
No!
No!
No!
No!
[Screaming]
The ice!
Let's run!
Watch out!
Come on, guys.
We're almost there.
We did it.
It's snowing again.
Okay, let's get another vehicle.
Let's try this way.
Come on.
Where are we?
It's the Lincoln tunnel.
We can take this all the way to New Jersey.
And how far is that?
It's about a mile.
Come on.
[Bill]:
Come on.
Dad, I don't think I can keep going.
Got to keep moving.
If we stop, we die.
Let's just go.
Honey, is that a house?
Sure looks like it.
Come on.
Can we go?
Yep, let's try it.
Come on.
It's so cold.
All right, I know, guys.
It's so cold.
Hello!
Hello!
Come on in, guys.
Sit down.
Get warm.
Hello?
I didn't see a car out front.
Looks like they left here pretty quickly.
Here.
Why don't you go see if you find some clothes,
See if you can find some food,
And be quick about it because we gotta get out of here.
Hello?
Hello?
[Crying]
Don't worry, baby.
We haven't forgotten about you.
We haven't forgotten you, Julia.
Here, honey, I found these upstairs.
Oh, great.
Here you go.
Should we just let him sleep?
No, no, no.
We gotta get going.
It may look like night, but it's only 3:00 pm.
Come on, wake up, Nelson.
It's time to go.
We don't have a car.
We don't have a car.
We gotta do it on foot.
Get going and maybe we can find one on the way.
Here, honey.
Shh.
What was that?
Hello?
We're just here for some warm clothes.
We're leaving now.
Thank you!
Wait!
Wait!
My daddy's hurt.
Wesley, come here.
Oh, thank god.
I think he came this way.
Oh.
I found people.
Listen to me.
Don't you ever leave me, okay?
Hey, are you all right?
Can we help?
You okay?
I was trying to load our truck up
And this whole thing fell on me.
It's got my leg pinned down here.
Okay, on the count of three, guys.
You ready?
One, two, three... let it go.
Let it go.
I think if you lift it straight up,
I can probably shimmy out.
Okay, ready?
Got it?
Oh, yeah.
You got it?
You clear?
Yeah.
Here.
Get up.
Daddy, you're bleeding.
I'll be okay, son.
Man, thank god you guys came along.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
We lost our van at the river... and your place was the first place we came upon.
I have a vest just like that.
Oh, yeah.
Actually, this is your vest.
We kind of broke into your place.
We didn't know anyone was here.
Relax.
Look, anything you need here,
Feel free to help yourself.
Besides, this place isn't even gonna be here in a hour.
Are we gonna fly now?
No, we're gonna take the truck, remember?
Look, you guys, we have plenty of room.
You're more than welcome to join us.
Which way you guys headed?
You know, we're gonna head west.
Yeah, we're headed to New York.
New York?
That's the last place you wanna go.
This iceberg is chewing up the entire east coast.
In a couple of hours, there's not gonna be a New York.
Our daughter's in New York.
Well, you do what you gotta do.
Me and Wesley, we're going west.
Hey, is this what I think it is?
My daddy can fly.
So can mine.
Does this still work?
Sure does.
Me and wesley would probably be in jamaica by now,
But only a fool would go up in this weather.
Guys, we're all packed up.
We're gonna head out.
You're still more than welcome to join us.
I know we talked about this, but I think I should go
And I'll meet you guys in Florida.
I am not leaving you, ever.
Dad, dad, you need me to navigate.
Okay.
Good luck.
You, too.
Nelson.
Okay, Nelson, get this out of the tarp.
Let's go.
Be careful.
How long do you think we have until the glacier gets here?
You hear that?
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Not long.
Let's go.
Come on!
Go!
There it is!
Jersey!
Come on, Julia!
[Sirens]
Come on!
We got to go!
Are we gonna be able to take off in this kind of weather?
Yeah, no problem.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?
All right, dad!
[Laughs]
We can probably be in New York in 30 minutes.
Just sit back and enjoy this bumpy ride.
These clouds don't look normal.
[Teri]:
Nothing looks normal.
Is that a twister?
Bill, fly us out of here.
What's wrong?
Can you fly above it?
I don't know.
Don't we have a weather detection device?
I don't see one.
Bill, we're flying right into the thick of that.
Hold on!
Dad, you got to get us out of here!
Fly higher!
Higher, Bill!
Ha ha!
Amazing, dad.
Dad!
Two o'clock!
Look!
Are they gonna go bomb the glacier?
I have no idea.
[Pilot]:
Everything proceeding properly, approaching glacier.
Roger that.
We're at the observation location.
We're at an altitude of 3-500 feet
And six miles from location impact.
We need the coordinates to plant the explosions.
Roger that.
Sending them now.
Teams five and six have landed, waiting for supplies.
Roger that.
We are descending now.
Lieutenant colonel Sinor, an hour till impact.
Affirmative?
63 minutes, major.
Roger that.
Come on, come on, get it, go, go!
Lieutenant colonel Sinor, how long until the payload drop?
Arriving now.
Roger that.
Come on.
We have to find shelter.
I have to tell my parents I'm in jersey.
We will.
Come on.
Can we just stop?
I'm tired.
Not yet.
We have to keep going.
Come on.
Hey!
Aah!
Aah!
Give me your coat!
Hey, let her go!
- What are you doing?
- Stop!
Let him go!
Give me your coat or I'm gonna kill you!
Stop!
Stop!
[Man]:
National Guard!
Stop!
Are you okay?
Stop!
What the hell are you two doing out here?
This city's been evacuated!
- To where?
- To shelters.
Hell, you guys are lucky I found you.
I was on my last sweep.
Let's go!
But what about the glacier?
Isn't it headed right for us?
Not for long.
There's a combined taskforce on its way to meet it.
So you've declared war on a glacier?
That's right.
It's the last chunk of the glacier, and they're putting everything they have on it.
Now get your asses inside before I have you arrested!
Go!
Go!
That's the last of the explosives, major.
Good, good!
All explosives have been deployed.
Roger that.
The charges are in place!
Take us back home!
Copy that.
Prepare for extraction.
Roger that.
Hey, Nelson.
Grab the computer.
I wanna find out... if we can connect to a satellite at this altitude.
Got it.
Should take a sec.
Reception blows up here.
I got a signal.
What do you want me to do?
Okay, I want you to connect up to the noaa website.
I wanna find out where that glacier is right now.
Got it.
What's the login?
Login is username Julia,
Password, Nelson.
Dad, that's lame.
That is sweet.
Lame or not, open up the tracking program.
Now run the simulation with the same coordinates,
But put in our GPS location right now.
What are you looking for?
Trying to find out how far away we are from that glacier.
Okay, it's 50 miles behind us.
It's moving at 200 miles an hour.
What?
How can a glacier move at 200 miles per hour?
I have no idea.
I don't think anybody else does either.
Can we outrun that?
Are we gonna make it on time?
Let's find out.
What's wrong?
We're icing up.
Doesn't this model have de-icers?
No.
We're gonna have to fly low if we're gonna make it.
We're burning fuel like crazy.
I need you guys to look outside... and see if you can find any kind of private airfield, a crop dusting operation, anything.
You guys finding anything?
How far away are we from New York?
Can't be more than 100 miles.
You guys seeing anything?
I don't see anything.
This visibility sucks balls.
Nelson!
Okay, guys, hold on.
We're gonna go lower.
Anything?
Nope, nothing.
We're still collecting a lotta ice.
I may have to put her down at any time, guys.
How much more ice can this thing take?
Not a lot.
These headwinds are killing us.
We could walk there faster.
How much further is it?
About another 10 minutes.
I'm gonna try to land her at Newark or La Quardia.
Will they allow us to land without a flight plan?
Well, I'll just radio ahead... and tell them we're an emergency.
They have to let us land.
What if there's no one there to hear us?
Oh, crap!
[Teri]:
What?
We just ran out of fuel in the right fuel tank!
Okay, guys, strap yourselves in.
Get ready.
We're gonna have to go for an emergency landing.
Really, Bill?
Yes!
Get ready!
God, look at all of these people.
Well, at least we get free cookies.
You think your parents are still trying to find us?
I hope so.
What about your family?
Dad's in northern Europe near Oslo.
It's probably the first hit.
It's okay.
I'm happy to be with you.
Okay, you guys.
We gotta get serious about finding another place to land, because we're not gonna make it to Newark.
We're entering into the New York air corridor now.
I'm gonna get on the radio... and see if anybody's there listening.
Give me the radio there, Nelson.
Newark tower, this is Cessna... where's the flight number?
Give me the flight number.
This is cessna number November niner, niner, 7-2-5.
Declaring an emergency.
Do you copy?
Can they even hear us?
Oh, I don't know.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, we're gonna find a hole and slip into it.
Buckle up, guys.
One way or another, we're gonna be on the ground... in a couple of minutes, so hold on.
I need you guys to look around... to see if you can see any other aircraft...
That might be landing without tower permission, okay?
Brace yourselves!
Two o'clock!
Look!
You okay?
You all right?
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay.
We're down.
Okay, okay.
Let's get out, guys.
Come on.
Come on out.
Come on, guys.
Here we go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Well, I guess we got out just in time.
Hey, guys, look.
It's New York.
We did it!
Almost there.
Yeah. [Laughs]
Did you crash that one eighty?
Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
I got all the insurance information if you need it.
If a crashed Cessna was all we had to worry about,
I'd call it a good day.
Come with me.
Let's get you into someplace safe.
Colonel sinor, this is command.
We are less than 30 seconds from detonation.
Roger that.
We are all clear and standing by.
Give me a long count, captain.
Fire!
[Laughs]
We got to get out of here.
Were you guys headed into Manhattan?
Yeah, because we're trying to get our daughter.
I'm sorry.
No one's getting in and out of New York alive.
Just stay here.
The National Guard's gonna be here to get you.
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.
I'll be right...
Oh!
Oh!
Come on, get back!
Get back!
We just gotta stay away from tall buildings... with lots of glass, got it?
Dad, we're going to Manhattan.
Point taken.
So how we gonna get there?
We got to get ourselves another car... and then just drive into the city.
- And go where?
- To the dorm.
The dorm?
She's not at the dorm and you know that.
We can only hope she got our message.
What, to go to Florida?
Look, she may not be in New York,
But we have start there.
From there, maybe we'll be able to find
Some sort of clue where she...
Are you willing to sacrifice?
Hey, guys!
Are we going or what?
Were the keys in the ignition?
I don't wanna know.
I don't even want to know.
Let's just go.
I'm gonna try and get hold of her again.
If we're in jersey, how far is New York?
Well, it shouldn't be too much longer.
We're coming up to the george washington bridge.
No signal.
It just keeps saying that all circuits are busy now.
It's not going through.
We just need to get under the gw.
I'll try to get the gps running.
Is everyone trying to get to New York?
Look at that mess.
Nelson, see if you can find another way to the bridge.
Sir, you're gonna have to turn your car around.
You can't get through here.
We have to get to Manhattan.
That's impossible.
No one's going over there.
No, our daughter is there, and we need to pick her up.
I don't care if the pope's over there.
No one's going in New York right now.
Look, it's not gonna matter soon anyway.
Please just let us go.
But you can't go.
Washington bridge, it's out.
Wow!
The Air Force is coming in for their last air strike.
Let's hope that does it,
Or maybe none of us will get out of here.
Come on, let's go!
What are you gonna do now, Bill?
I don't know.
I'm out of ideas.
I know that's not true.
I know that you're thinking something.
What?
Oh, it's just that
Remember when the kids were really, really young... and we thought that if we could put... some sort of tracking device on them, we'd always know where they are?
I knew I should have invented that device.
Damn it!
Wait, wait, guys!
We do have a tracking device!
What are you talking about, Nelson?
Oh, of course!
Of course what?
Even if we can't talk to her on her phone, we can track her phone.
Really?
We can do that?
Yes.
Isn't that illegal?
Don't ask.
I got it!
She's in New Jersey!
New Jersey?
She's here!
She's in New Jersey!
Oh, my god, Bill.
Where?
Um... four miles that way.
Two more miles.
Hurry, Bill!
Okay, people, this is it!
Stay back.
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment is at hand!
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment is at hand!
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment...
How far are we?
1.7 miles.
Which way do we go?
There's gonna be a dead end on your left,
So we have to go right.
Okay, guys, here we go.
Hold on a second!
T minus 2 minutes for launch.
Okay, well, we're not getting through this.
How far away is she?
Dad, she's just two blocks away.
Okay, we're going on foot, guys.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's the gps say?
She's that way!
One more block this way!
Just over a block!
Oh!
Dad, my phone!
Got to get my phone to find her!
Nelson, listen to me.
We'll find her.
Forget it, forget it!
We don't have time!
Let's go.
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Look!
What the hell?
That's my dad.
Julia!
Dad!
Dad!
Julia!
Daddy!
I got her!
Let's go!
Daddy!
Oh, Julia, are you okay?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
Oh, my god.
Oh, thank god.
Oh, baby.
Hi, baby.
Oh, I can't believe it!
We got her.
You all right?
Let me see you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Dad, this is Logan.
Hi, Logan.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's get to safety, guys.
Come on.
[Nelson]:
Dad, drive!
Dad, get us out of here!
The bridges are down, streets are blocked, the river's frozen.
What are we gonna do?
Daddy?
[Logan]:
Are you driving on the Hudson river?
Is it gonna hold?
[Nelson]:
It didn't last time.
[Julia]:
Last time?
What?
[Nelson]:
You see that?
Those are F-16s going in!
[Teri]:
What was that?
Sounds like something big just blew up.
[Teri]:
We're not gonna be able to outrun it!
What are we gonna do?
We cannot keep going on like this!
I know!
I'm trying to find a way off the river!
Any ideas?
How about that?
Okay, if we can make it.
Glacier appears to be breaking up.
Okay, everybody out!
Let's go!
Okay, go on through!
Come on through!
Let's go!
No, no, no, forget it.
Forget it.
Let's go upstairs!
Keep going!
Hurry!
Okay, get down.
Get down.
Honey.
Hear anything?
No.
Is it done?
Hold on.
Come on.
Come on up.
You okay?
Yeah.
Oh.
BLUE TEAM TO BASE CAMP.
GO, BLUE TEAM.
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY SEEMS TO BE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY.
I'M HEADING NORTH ON THE SHELF TO COLLECT MORE DATA.
COPY.
BLUE TEAM, REPORTS SHOW
THE HEKLA VOLCANO IS HAVING IMMENSE SEISMIC READINGS.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.
COPY THAT.
BASE CAMP, WE'RE SEEING INTENSE MAGNA FLOW
RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE RANGE.
IF IT KEEPS INCREASING,
WE MAY HAVE TO EVACUATE THE AREA NOW,
ALL THE LOCAL AREAS.
BASE CAMP, IF THE WHOLE RANGE STARTS ERUPTING,
WE'RE LOOKING AT A WHOLE GLACIER DETACHING FROM THE SHELF.
[HORNS HONKING]
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
CAN I REALLY TALK TO BASE ON THIS THING?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
TRY A LOWER BAND.
THERE YOU GO.
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
[SIGHS] JUST CAN'T GET IT.
THERE'S TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE.
I'M GOING TO TAKE DOWN A PLANE WITH THIS THING.
BETTER NOT.
HEY, DID YOU PACK YOUR GORTEX?
HELLO?
JULIA?
JULIA?
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU HEARD ME A SECOND AGO.
MOM PACKED IT.
WELL, GOOD, I'M GLAD.
YOU KNOW, IT GETS COLD IN NEW YORK, JULIA.
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
SUMMIT CAMP, COME IN.
DAD, I THINK I JUST GOT 'EM.
OH, GREAT.
6SNL7, COME IN.
DAD, I'M GONNA MISS MY FLIGHT!
HOLD ON.
DAD, THIS IS MY TERMINAL.
DAD!
6SNL7, COME IN.
THIS IS SUMMIT CAMP.
GO AHEAD.
DIVYA?
HEY, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I'M BRINGING SOME NEW INSTRUMENTS NEXT WEEK.
BILL, HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE DATA WE SENT?
NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT IN THE OFFICE.
I'M DROPPING JULIA OFF AT THE AIRPORT.
WHY?
WHAT'S UP?
WE'RE EVACUATING.
THE REST OF THE TEAM IS GONE ALREADY.
I'M THE LAST MAN STANDING.
EVACUATING?
WHY?
DAD, I SHOULD JUST WALK FROM HERE.
HEKLA WENT BERSERK.
THERE'S A HUGE PRESSURE BUILDUP.
THE ENDURANCE READINGS ARE OFF THE CHART.
THE ENTIRE HEKLA LINE IS ERUPTING.
THERE IS PRESSURE BUILDING UP EVERYWHERE.
BILL, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
PRESSURE BUILDING UP WHERE?
AT WHAT SITE?
I'M TRYING.
GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE SEEING ACTIVITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE RANGE.
WAIT, AT ALL THE SITES?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, DIVYA.
I CHECKED WITH THE OTHER STATIONS.
NO ONE'S EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
I SENT YOU EVERYTHING WE GOT
BEFORE THE CENTERS MELTED DOWN, BILL.
LOOK AT THE DATA!
NO, I'M NOT AT THE OFFICE.
I'LL BE THERE IN AN HOUR.
PULL UP THE COMPUTER SIMULATION.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
DIVYA?
[HORNS HONKING]
OKAY, I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL NOW.
NO NEED TO SAY GOODBYE OR ANYTHING.
REYKJANES RIDGE?
YEAH.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
MAGNA FLOW RATE?
F7.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK AROUND CHRISTMASTIME
UNLESS I DECIDE TO STAY IN NEW YORK FOREVER.
DIVYA, COME IN.
DIVYA, IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME,
I WILL LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I WILL CONTACT YOU
AS SOON AS I GET TO THE OFFICE.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
6SNL7, COME IN.
5-3-7-6-E-9.
6SNL7, DO YOU COPY?
SIR, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
IT'S FINE.
I'M JUST DROPPING MY DAUGHTER OFF.
WE'LL BE TWO MINUTES.
6SNL7, DO YOU READ?
SIR?
OH, MY GOD.
COME IN, 6SNL7.
DO YOU READ?
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
SIR?
HART, DO YOU READ ME?
YES, GO AHEAD, DIVYA.
I READ YOU.
GO AHEAD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
SIR, THIS IS A NO PARKING ZONE.
THIS IS LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY.
I NEED YOU TO MOVE YOUR--
THIS IS MASSIVE!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
EVERY SINGLE VOLCANO IS ERUPTING!
SAY AGAIN.
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
THE ENTIRE ICE SHELF IS FRACTURING!
IT'S 1,000 MILES LONG!
BILL, DO YOU READ ME?
[ALARM BEEPS]
[STATIC]
SOMETHING ABOUT THE VOLCANO.
IS NOT MOVING.
DAD, WE NEED TO GO.
LOOK.
YEAH.
WHERE'S JULIA?
SHE LEFT, LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.
WHAT?
AH, CRAP.
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE, DAD?
NO, NO, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED HER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR SISTER.
MOM'S GONNA KILL YOU.
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.
DAD, WHAT IS DR. CHANDRA SAYING ABOUT THE GLACIER?
DID IT CALF?
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT IT SOUNDED A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT.
THAT WOULD BE SICK.
SICK, HUH?
100%.
WHY DON'T YOU BRING UP THE SIMULATION AGAIN
ON THE PARAMETER SCREEN, OKAY?
OKAY, LET'S SEE.
OKAY, USING THESE NUMBERS,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
FOR THE ICE FLOW PROJECTION, OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ROY?
BILL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT IN THE FIELD.
I JUST SPOKE WITH DIVYA,
AND HE HAD SENT YOU SOME DATA.
DID YOU RECEIVE IT?
YEAH, THE HEKLA VOLCANO JUST ERUPTED.
NO, BUT IT SOUNDED MORE THAN THE HEKLA,
LIKE THE WHOLE RANGE WENT UP.
WE KNOW.
HART, GO HOME.
WE'VE GOT THIS.
I COULD BE PULLING MAPS OR CRUNCHING NUMBERS.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SEND ME HOME?
BILL, WE DON'T NEED YOU.
ROY, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR 15 YEARS.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?
BILL, I HAVE JUST PUT CYNTHIA AND MY KIDS
ON A PLANE TO MEXICO.
YOU DO THE SAME.
WE HAVE GOT CHUNKS OF ICE
FALLING ALL OVER CANADA.
IN 19 HOURS, THE BULK OF THE GLACIER
IS GOING TO HIT NORTH AMERICA.
BILL, GET YOUR FAMILY OUT NOW.
WHAT DID YOU GET?
IT WON'T LET ME INPUT THIS DATA.
OKAY.
WELL, LET'S OPEN UP A TERMINAL WINDOW
AND WE'LL ENTER SANDBOX MODE.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, IT'S A MODE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO ENTER IN VARIABLES THAT ARE THEORETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS WE GOT TO GET YOUR MOM.
WHY?
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU ON THE WAY.
HOLD ON.
EXCUSE ME, SENATOR.
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
BUT I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CYRUS
OVER AT AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES,
AND HE SAID THAT ALL THE FLIGHTS ARE GROUNDED
BECAUSE OF THE VOLCANIC ASH FLOW.
GET QUINCY IN DC AND ASK HIM
IF THEY'RE GONNA POSTPONE THE SUMMIT.
YES, SENATOR.
HEY.
YOUR DAUGHTER'S FLYING OUT TODAY.
YES.
STARTING COLLEGE.
NYU.
TERI, THESE VOLCANOES ARE IN GREENLAND.
JULIA'S FLYING INTO NEW YORK.
SHE'LL BE FINE.
I HOPE SO.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, SIR.
THANK YOU.
TERI?
TERI?
TERI?
BILL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
NO, NO.
JULIA IS FINE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
PLEASE DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS TALKING TO DIVYA ABOUT THE PETERMANN GLACIER.
DIVYA?
PETERMANN?
WHAT IS THAT?
HI, BILL.
HI, SENATOR.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT WITH JULIA?
EVERYTHING'S FINE WITH JULIA, SENATOR.
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
BUT YOU NEED TO LEAVE TOWN RIGHT NOW, SIR.
BILL!
BILL WAS JUST LEAVING, SENATOR.
SO SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
LOOK, THERE IS A HUGE GLACIER COMING OUR WAY,
AND IT'S COMING AT US REALLY, REALLY QUICK.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF TOWN!
LISTEN, I HAVE A SUMMIT MEETING.
NO, NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND.
MOM, MOM!
THIS IS TRUE!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF MAINE.
REALLY?
YOU'RE GONNA BRING OUR SON INTO ALL YOUR WEATHER--
IT'S TRUE!
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SO SORRY.
HI, JOSH.
HI.
HEY, BILL.
I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYBODY
ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE SUMMIT.
NOT EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE IS PICKING UP.
YOU'D BETTER BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
JOSH, GO HOME.
WHAT?
NO, DON'T GO HOME.
GET OUT OF MAINE.
GO AS FAR SOUTH AS YOU CAN!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
Teri:
DON'T SCARE HIM LIKE THAT!
EAGLE CLIFF, FLIGHT DECK.
REQUESTING SAT-COM COORDINATES.
OVER.
HOLD FOR GPS.
GLACIER LOCATED.
58-42 NORTH, 39-02 WEST,
BEARING 210.
OVER.
COPY THAT.
EAGLE CLIFF FLIGHT DECK CLEAR.
FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0 CLEAR TO TAKE OFF.
ROGER, I'M GETTING A VISUAL NOW.
THIS IS FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0.
IT'S HEADING TOWARDS NEWFOUNDLAND.
WHY IS IT GETTING DARKER?
THE WEATHER'S CHANGING.
DAD, ARE YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON?
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
I NEED TO CALL JULIA.
CAN WE GO HOME FIRST?
I NEED TO GET MY LAPTOP.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF TOWN.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
DON'T THEY HAVE WI-FI ON AIRPLANES?
MAYBE IF SHE WAS FLYING FIRST CLASS.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FLYING AT ALL TODAY.
NOT TODAY.
DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S GONNA BE LANDING SOON.
WE'LL GET HOLD OF HER.
IT'LL BE OKAY.
WHOA.
USE WORDS, NELSON.
I DON'T THINK I CAN.
WHAT?
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING BACK HOME.
WHY NOT?
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.
LOOK AT THE CLOUDS.
WHAT CAN DO THAT?
GLACIERS.
REALLY, REALLY FAST GLACIERS.
OKAY, SO WHERE WE GOING?
NEW YORK.
TAKE US ABOUT 7, 8 HOURS.
HEY.
HEY!
[LAUGHS]
I MISSED YOU.
I MISSED YOU, TOO.
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG.
TRAFFIC WAS A MESS.
I KNOW.
THEY GROUNDED ALL THE FLIGHTS.
THEY DID?
DAMN.
MM-HMM.
GUESS WE'RE GONNA BE HERE A WHILE, HUH?
WELL, THAT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING.
OOH, I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
[CELL PHONE BUZZES]
OH, CRAP.
I'M SORRY.
WHO'S THAT?
NO ONE.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE DORM AND FOOL AROUND.
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
JULIA, WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU AT YOUR DORM, OKAY, HONEY?
SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE DORM, JUST STAY THERE, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU THERE.
ALL RIGHT, BIG HUGS, AND LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU.
BYE.
ARE YOU SURE THAT NEW YORK IS SAFE?
BILL?
HOW STUPID.
WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE HER FLY AND MEET US DOWN IN FLORIDA?
SWEETHEART, EVERYTHING IS GROUNDED.
I SAY WE STAY ON PLAN
AND WE JUST MEET HER AT THE DORM.
FINE.
OH, MY GOSH!
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE OKAY.
DAD, I THINK IT'S COMING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT!
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS?
NO.
THE GLACIERS ARE MAKING IT SNOW IN MAINE?
IT'S SUMMER.
CAN YOU JUST GET US OUT OF MAINE NOW?
HOW BIG DO THESE GLACIERS HAVE TO BE TO DO THIS?
BILL?
[HORNS HONKING]
CRAP.
DAD, DOES THIS SNOW MEAN THE GLACIER'S GETTING CLOSE?
BILL, IT HAS TO BECAUSE THE CLOUDS ARE LOOKING MASSIVE.
I BET THIS GLACIER IS ENORMOUS,
LIKE THE WHOLE SHELF.
YEAH.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO.
I GOT TO FIND A WAY AROUND THIS TRAFFIC.
NELSON, JUMP ON THE GPS AND FIND ME AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.
ON IT.
BILL, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW!
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE GLACIER IS CLOSE.
THOSE MILITARY PLANES?
F-16s.
NELSON, FOCUS.
GPS.
TARGET IS 400 MILES OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST
AND IS NOW IN RANGE.
SIR, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
I SEE NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
THERE IS NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, LOOK AGAIN.
HOLY SH--
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
DELTA BRAVO ONE, DO YOU READ ME?
DELTA BRAVO ONE?
ALPHA FOXTROT, THIS IS CONTROL.
FIRE SEQUENCE IN 3...2... 1...
FIRE!
OH, MY GOD!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?
IS IT GONE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
I THINK WE OUTRAN IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BILL?
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE?
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST PULL OVER.
NO, NOT YET, NOT YET.
EVERYTHING IS GONE, ISN'T IT?
JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT, NELSON?
EVERYTHING.
GOD, MY FRIENDS.
I NEED TO GET ONLINE!
NO, NO.
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT, OKAY?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!
NO, THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT!
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
MOM, YOUR CELL PHONE.
IT'S JULIA.
JULIA?
JULIA!
MOM!
OH, MY GOD.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?
WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.
DAD'S HERE AND NELSON'S HERE.
Julia:
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE DON'T KNOW.
THE NEWS IS SAYING THAT BANGOR JUST GOT DESTROYED.
TELL HER WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
Nelson:
MOM, CAN I JUST TALK TO HER?
TELL HER THAT WE'LL BE AT HER DORM
IN SIX HOURS FROM NOW.
WE'RE GONNA BE AT YOUR DORM IN SIX HOURS, OKAY?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
JULIA?
JULIA?
[STATIC]
HELLO?
LET ME TALK TO HER.
JULIA, LISTEN.
IF THE WEATHER BREAKS, HEAD SOUTH TO FLORIDA
TO YOUR AUNT KISSY'S HOUSE.
THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU GO, THE SAFER IT IS.
JULIA?
HELLO?
JULIA?
HELLO?
SWEETHEART, IF YOU CAN...[BREAKING UP]
MOM?
LOST IT.
DAD, I WANTED TO TALK TO HER.
SORRY, BUDDY.
WELL, WHAT?
MY PARENTS ARE COMING FOR ME.
I THINK THEY WANT US TO STAY AT THE DORM.
WELL, WE SHOULD GET GOING THEN.
YEAH.
IT'S GETTING COLD FAST.
COME ON!
Announcer:
EVACUATION IS MANDATORY
IN MOST NORTHEAST COASTAL TOWNS.
WE'VE BEEN INFORMED,
FOLLOWING AN ONSITE EVALUATION,
THE PRESIDENT WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE
WITH THE MOST CURRENT UPDATE.
THE MILITARY CURRENTLY HAS AWAC IN THE AIR
ASSESSING THE THREAT.
DROPPING OUT AT 400.
TARGET IS BREAKING UP,
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
SAY AGAIN, JOHNNY BRAVO.
TARGET IS SEPARATING INTO MULTIPLE SECTIONS
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT
HEADING SOUTH DOWN THE COAST.
WOW.
CLOUD COVER'S JUST SO THICK,
IT LOOKS LIKE NIGHT.
I'M GETTING NOTHING.
I'M TRYING TO CALL HER BACK.
[BUSY SIGNAL]
LOOK, SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, OKAY?
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE OKAY.
[BUSY SIGNAL]
CAN'T GET HOLD OF THE SENATOR.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYBODY.
[BUSY SIGNAL]
DAD, YOU SAID THE PETERMANN GLACIER WAS HOW BIG?
LET'S SEE, THE LAST CALVING HAPPENED IN 2010.
THAT WAS ABOUT 100 SQUARE MILES,
WHICH IS ROUGHLY FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN,
AND THAT WAS ONLY 8% OF THE GLACIER.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S THE WHOLE GLACIER.
WITH ENOUGH SPEED, WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT COULD DO?
WHAT?
DAD!
[SHOUTING AND SCREAMING]
WHICH WAY'S YOUR ROOM?
THIS WAY.
COME ON.
KAREN!
OH, MY GOD, JULIA.
I CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYONE IN MAINE.
JUST TRY AGAIN, OKAY?
IT TOOK ME THREE TRIES.
KEEP TRYING.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
KEEP TRYING.
[THUNDER]
IS THERE A BASEMENT?
NO, THERE'D BE NO RECEPTION IN THE BASEMENT.
I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.
COME ON, JULIA!
NO, THAT'S A MISTAKE.
NO, JULIA, WE HAVE TO GO!
[GROANING AND CREAKING]
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HURRY!
PUT YOUR JACKET ON.
WE GOT TO GO.
BUT MY DAD SAID TO STAY HERE.
I KNOW.
CALL HIM AND TELL HIM,
BUT WE AREN'T STAYING HERE, JULIA!
MOM!
DAD!
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE!
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN WE--
I LOST THE SIGNAL.
YOU THINK THE MESSAGE WENT THROUGH?
I HOPE SO.
SO THEN WHAT NOW?
HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THE CITY?
EVERYTHING'S SHUT DOWN.
WE GET TO ONE OF THE BRIDGES AND GET ACROSS THE RIVER!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
JULIA, WHAT ABOUT THE SUBWAY?
THE SUBWAYS ARE SHUT DOWN, TOO.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIN, JULIA.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TUNNELS.
WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH ONE OF THOSE.
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'LL WORK?
WOULD YOU RATHER STAY UP HERE?
COME ON!
OH...
OH.
YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY, DAD.
YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE OKAY.
WE'LL WORK OUR WAY OUT.
COME ON.
NELSON'S OKAY.
WE'RE GOOD.
THE SUN IS BREAKING THROUGH.
COME ON.
EASY, EASY.
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST A CUT.
COME ON.
GET NELSON.
COME ON, SWEETIE.
NELSON?
YOU OKAY?
BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
BROKEN BONES?
NO.
ANYTHING?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, OKAY.
GOOD JOB.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE, DAD.
GOOD JOB.
OKAY, LET'S GET MOVING.
LET'S GO.
WE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.
KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CAR.
SEE IF THAT VAN WORKS.
OKAY, GUYS, COME ON.
[COUGH] COME ON.
Nelson:
SO COLD.
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.
OKAY, GUYS, GET IN.
GET IN, HONEY.
LOOK FOR SOME KEYS.
I'M GONNA CHECK THIS OUT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
IT'S SO COLD.
WHERE'S DAD GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.
HELLO?
HELLO?
WHERE'S DAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK, THOUGH, HONEY.
MOM, THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION.
OH, GOOD.
LET'S START IT.
[ENGINE WON'T START]
COME ON.
TRY AGAIN.
[ENGINE STARTS]
YES!
OKAY, GOOD.
IT'S A MESS IN HERE.
SMELLS LIKE SHIT.
OH, GOOD.
YOU GOT IT RUNNING.
YEAH.
OKAY, BAD NEWS.
THERE'S A BIG PILEUP.
WE GOT TO FIND A WAY--
[SNIFFING] WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I THINK IT'S MANURE OR SOMETHING.
IT SMELLS AWFUL.
MANURE?
LIKE FERTILIZER?
YEAH.
WHAT KIND?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HONEY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT.
EXCELLENT.
OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHERE'D HE GO?
[CRASH]
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE DAD COMES BACK SOON.
OKAY, INSIDE.
GO.
OKAY, HEADS DOWN.
HEADS DOWN.
HERE WE GO.
HEADS DOWN.
OKAY, WHY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.
WHAT KIND OF SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, BILL?
THE KIND THAT GOES BOOM.
SEE, WHEN YOU TAKE AMMONIUM NITRATE
AND YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIESEL FUEL, YOU GET...
WHOA!
DAD, WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO DO THAT?
IN SCIENCE CLASS.
[PHONE BEEPS]
OH, GOD, BILL.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION, I THINK.
I DO.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION.
PULL OVER.
PULL OVER RIGHT NOW!
MOM GOT A RECEPTION?
YEAH.
WELL?
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
IT'S JULIA.
WHERE WE GOING TO GO?
MOM, DAD, WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
NELSON, GET ON THE SHORTWAVE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL--
SOMETHING BAD HAS HIT HER DORM.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PLAYING IT AGAIN.
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
WE'RE NOT SAFE--
SOMETHING'S HIT THE DORM REALLY BAD AND SHE'S TRYING TO GET OUT.
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
SHE'S SAYING SHE CANNOT GET OUT OF NEW YORK CITY.
[EXPLOSION] WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?
IT'S A SONIC BOOM.
10 BIRDS IN FORMATION.
THEY'RE GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER.
CAN THEY DO THAT?
CAN THEY BOMB A GLACIER, BILL?
YEAH, THEY COULD DO THAT,
BUT THEY'D NEED TO HIT IT WITH A NUCLEAR BOMB
TO STOP THIS THING.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THEY SAID BOSTON'S GONNA BE HIT NEXT
IF THEY DON'T STOP IT.
BOSTON?
WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
OSCAR CHARLIE AND DELTA X-RAY APPROACHING TARGET.
ROGER, OSCAR CHARLIE.
ORDERING NUCLEAR PAYLOAD ACTIVE.
NUKES ARE HOT, WAITING FOR COUNTDOWN.
MY SON WAS BORN IN BOSTON, SO LET'S MELT THIS ICE.
ROGER THAT.
FIRE ONE!
OSCAR CHARLIE, DO YOU HAVE A VISUAL?
CHECKING NOW.
COMMAND 483.
NUKES DEPLOYED,
BUT THEY HAVE NO VISUAL EFFECT.
WAITING ON NEXT COMMAND.
EVERYONE LOOKS SO SCARED.
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
LOOK, WE GOT THIS BIG EMPTY VAN,
ALL THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP.
I FIGURE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL OPEN UP A DOOR--
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WE NEED TO GET HER, AND SHE IS OUR PRIORITY.
SHE'S OUR TOP PRIORITY, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
I FIGURE WE CAN HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE
RIDE WITH US TO NEW YORK.
IT'LL TAKE TWO MINUTES--
NO!
TWO MINUTES?
YEAH, TWO MINUTES.
HONEY, WE JUST CAN'T LEAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
HONEY?
MOM, DAD...
HEAR THAT?
EVERYBODY OKAY?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
I THINK WE MADE IT.
LET'S KEEP GOING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
BOSTON'S BEEN HIT!
THE GLACIER'S LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM US!
IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!
IT'S TOO LATE.
WE HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS NOT TO COME.
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
ALL THE CIRCUITS ARE BUSY.
NO SURPRISE THERE.
KEEP IT ON.
WE'LL TRY AGAIN LATER.
WE GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
COME ON.
BABE, I KNOW WHERE WE ARE.
WE COULD TAKE A TUNNEL.
WE TRIED THEM ALL.
THEY'RE CLOSED!
TRUST ME!
GO, GO.
HURRY.
HURRY!
BE CAREFUL.
CAREFUL.
WE USED TO GO THIS WAY WHEN WE WERE, LIKE, 12.
JUST NEED TO FIND A LIGHT.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WE REALLY HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE?
YEAH.
IT'S SAFER THAN UP THERE.
OH, GOD.
WHAT IF MY PARENTS TRY TO MAKE IT TO NEW YORK?
THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOUR MESSAGE.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF--
THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE.
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIND SOME GAS SOON.
I CAN LOG ON AND FIND US A GAS STATION.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, HONEY.
POWER GRID IS DOWN, BUDDY.
THAT MEANS NO WI-FI, NO GAS STATIONS.
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
WE JUST NEED TO FIND HIM SOME FOOD
AND LET'S FIND SOME GAS.
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S JUST START LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.
DAD, LOOK!
YOU CAN SIPHON GAS.
GREAT IDEA.
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S START LOOKING FOR CARS,
HOPEFULLY FILLED WITH FOOD.
HANG IN THERE, NELSON.
WE'RE ALMOST IN NEW YORK, OKAY?
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN, BILL.
I THINK I SEE SOME CARS IN THE DISTANCE.
Nelson:
IT'S JUST SO CREEPY
WHEN IT GETS DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
HONEY, JUST GET WHAT WE NEED AND GET BACK.
BE CAREFUL.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S IN THERE.
JUST STAY THERE.
WHY?
JUST STAY THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.
I GOT THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO PEE.
OKAY.
[COUGHS]
I'M GLAD THAT WAS YOU AND NOT ME.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
IT'S WORKING.
THAT IS SOME STRONG STUFF.
WHEW!
HEY, WE'RE IN CONNECTICUT.
HONEY?
I'M NOT STOPPING.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.
HEY, NELSON, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO PULL UP ANYTHING ON THE GPS?
NOT REALLY.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT?
HAND 'EM OVER.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE BACK THERE, CHEF NELSON?
OH, MAN!
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU GUYS.
YEAH, SURE YOU WERE.
DINNER?
THANKS.
THANK YOU, HONEY.
NELSON, HOW MUCH LONGER TO NEW YORK?
ABOUT TWO HOURS.
YOU THINK SHE'S STILL AT THE DORM?
I'M SURE YOUR SISTER'S FINE.
SHE'S A SMART GIRL AND SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
IT'S THIS WAY.
YOU SURE WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN HERE IN 10 YEARS.
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN AND TRUST ME, OKAY?
IT'S THE ONLY WAY, JULIA.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING DEEPER, THOUGH.
[CREAKING]
WHAT WAS THAT?
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER IT IS, IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
COME ON.
[CREAKING AND GROANING]
WOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE.
COME ON.

WE'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN, OKAY?
OH, CRAP.

OH, THAT'S COOL, THAT'S COOL.
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY COLD OUT HERE, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOMEPLACE WARM.

YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO.
I'LL GET A CAR.
I'LL GO TO CALIFORNIA.
YOU KNOW, HEY, I'LL GO TO THE BEACH
AND THE PRETTY BLONDE WOMEN.
MAYBE HAVE TEQUILAS ON THE BEACH.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.
NICE MEETING YOU.
NO, NO, HEY, HEY, HEY!
I'M THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND I COULD GO TO CALIFORNIA TOGETHER.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK.
OH, YEAH, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK'S REALLY COLD,
AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO GO SOMEPLACE THAT'S WARM.
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU, OKAY?

WE NEED TO GO TO CALIFORNIA.

I GOT MY FAMILY RIGHT THERE.
JUST CALM DOWN.
LOOK AT ME!
WE'RE GOING TO CALIFORNIA.
I GOT SOME MONEY.
THAT CAN HELP.
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

I DON'T WANT YOUR FOOD.
HEY, WHAT KIND OF FOOD YOU GOT?
I NEED TO GET INTO THE VAN.
YEAH, YEAH.
NO, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.

I'M THINKING THAT
I SHOULD GET IN THE CAR WITH YOU GUYS.
NO, NO, NO.
HEY!
HEY!
HEY!
BILL, COME ON.
I'M NOT A BAD GUY.
I HEAR YOU.
NO, NO, I'M A GOOD GUY.
I'M A GREAT GUY.

[SCREAMING]
THE ICE!
LET'S RUN!
WATCH OUT!
COME ON, GUYS.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
WE DID IT.
IT'S SNOWING AGAIN.
OKAY, LET'S GET ANOTHER VEHICLE.
LET'S TRY THIS WAY.
COME ON.
WHERE ARE WE?
IT'S THE LINCOLN TUNNEL.
WE CAN TAKE THIS ALL THE WAY TO NEW JERSEY.
AND HOW FAR IS THAT?
IT'S ABOUT A MILE.
COME ON.
Bill:
COME ON.
DAD, I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP GOING.
GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
IF WE STOP, WE DIE.
LET'S JUST GO.
HONEY, IS THAT A HOUSE?
SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.
COME ON.
CAN WE GO?
YEP, LET'S TRY IT.
COME ON.
IT'S SO COLD.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW, GUYS.
IT'S SO COLD.
HELLO!
HELLO!
COME ON IN, GUYS.
SIT DOWN.
GET WARM.
HELLO?
I DIDN'T SEE A CAR OUT FRONT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY LEFT HERE PRETTY QUICKLY.
HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE IF YOU FIND SOME CLOTHES,
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME FOOD,
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
HELLO?
HELLO?
[CRYING]
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU, JULIA.
HERE, HONEY, I FOUND THESE UPSTAIRS.
OH, GREAT.
HERE YOU GO.
SHOULD WE JUST LET HIM SLEEP?
NO, NO, NO.
WE GOT TO GET GOING.
IT MAY LOOK LIKE NIGHT,
BUT IT'S ONLY 3:00 P.M.
COME ON, WAKE UP, NELSON.
IT'S TIME TO GO.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE GOT TO DO IT ON FOOT.
GET GOING AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND ONE ON THE WAY.
HERE, HONEY.
SHH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HELLO?
WE'RE JUST HERE FOR SOME WARM CLOTHES.
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
THANK YOU!
WAIT!
WAIT!
MY DADDY'S HURT.
WESLEY, COME HERE.
OH, THANK GOD.
I THINK HE CAME THIS WAY.
OH.
I FOUND PEOPLE.
LISTEN TO ME.
DON'T YOU EVER LEAVE ME, OKAY?
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
CAN WE HELP?
YOU OKAY?
I WAS TRYING TO LOAD OUR TRUCK UP
AND THIS WHOLE THING FELL ON ME.
IT'S GOT MY LEG PINNED DOWN HERE.
OKAY, ON THE COUNT OF THREE, GUYS.
YOU READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE...
LET IT GO.
LET IT GO.
I THINK IF YOU LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP,
I CAN PROBABLY SHIMMY OUT.
OKAY, READY?
GOT IT?
OH, YEAH.
YOU GOT IT?
YOU CLEAR?
YEAH.
HERE.
GET UP.
DADDY, YOU'RE BLEEDING.
I'LL BE OKAY, SON.
MAN, THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME ALONG.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WE LOST OUR VAN AT THE RIVER
AND YOUR PLACE WAS THE FIRST PLACE WE CAME UPON.
I HAVE A VEST JUST LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THIS IS YOUR VEST.
WE KIND OF BROKE INTO YOUR PLACE.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE.
RELAX.
LOOK, ANYTHING YOU NEED HERE,
FEEL FREE TO HELP YOURSELF.
BESIDES, THIS PLACE ISN'T EVEN GONNA BE HERE IN A HOUR.
ARE WE GONNA FLY NOW?
NO, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE TRUCK, REMEMBER?
LOOK, YOU GUYS, WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM.
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
WHICH WAY YOU GUYS HEADED?
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HEAD WEST.
YEAH, WE'RE HEADED TO NEW YORK.
NEW YORK?
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE YOU WANT TO GO.
THIS ICEBERG IS CHEWING UP THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEW YORK.
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WELL, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
ME AND WESLEY, WE'RE GOING WEST.
HEY, IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?
MY DADDY CAN FLY.
SO CAN MINE.
DOES THIS STILL WORK?
SURE DOES.
ME AND WESLEY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN JAMAICA BY NOW,
BUT ONLY A FOOL WOULD GO UP IN THIS WEATHER.
GUYS, WE'RE ALL PACKED UP.
WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT.
YOU'RE STILL MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT I THINK I SHOULD GO
AND I'LL MEET YOU GUYS IN FLORIDA.
I AM NOT LEAVING YOU, EVER.
DAD, DAD, YOU NEED ME TO NAVIGATE.
OKAY.
GOOD LUCK.
YOU, TOO.
NELSON.
OKAY, NELSON, GET THIS OUT OF THE TARP.
LET'S GO.
BE CAREFUL.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE UNTIL THE GLACIER GETS HERE?
YOU HEAR THAT?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
NOT LONG.
LET'S GO.
COME ON!
GO!
THERE IT IS!
JERSEY!
COME ON, JULIA!
[SIRENS]
COME ON!
WE GOT TO GO!
ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
YOU READY?
ALL RIGHT, DAD!
[LAUGHS]
WE CAN PROBABLY BE IN NEW YORK IN 30 MINUTES.
JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS BUMPY RIDE.
THESE CLOUDS DON'T LOOK NORMAL.
Teri:
NOTHING LOOKS NORMAL.
IS THAT A TWISTER?
BILL, FLY US OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAN YOU FLY ABOVE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T WE HAVE A WEATHER DETECTION DEVICE?
I DON'T SEE ONE.
BILL, WE'RE FLYING RIGHT INTO THE THICK OF THAT.
HOLD ON!
DAD, YOU GOT TO GET US OUT OF HERE!
FLY HIGHER!
HIGHER, BILL!
HA HA!
AMAZING, DAD.
DAD!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
ARE THEY GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
Pilot:
EVERYTHING PROCEEDING PROPERLY, APPROACHING GLACIER.
ROGER THAT.
WE'RE AT THE OBSERVATION LOCATION.
WE'RE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 3-500 FEET
AND SIX MILES FROM LOCATION IMPACT.
WE NEED THE COORDINATES TO PLANT THE EXPLOSIONS.
ROGER THAT.
SENDING THEM NOW.
TEAMS FIVE AND SIX HAVE LANDED,
WAITING FOR SUPPLIES.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE DESCENDING NOW.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
AN HOUR TILL IMPACT.
AFFIRMATIVE?
63 MINUTES, MAJOR.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON, COME ON, GET IT, GO, GO!
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
HOW LONG UNTIL THE PAYLOAD DROP?
ARRIVING NOW.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON.
WE HAVE TO FIND SHELTER.
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS I'M IN JERSEY.
WE WILL.
COME ON.
CAN WE JUST STOP?
I'M TIRED.
NOT YET.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
HEY!
AAH!
AAH!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT!
HEY, LET HER GO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!
LET HIM GO!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT OR I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
STOP!
STOP!
Man:
NATIONAL GUARD!
STOP!
ARE YOU OKAY?
STOP!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING OUT HERE?
THIS CITY'S BEEN EVACUATED!
TO WHERE?
TO SHELTERS.
HELL, YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY I FOUND YOU.
I WAS ON MY LAST SWEEP.
LET'S GO!
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GLACIER?
ISN'T IT HEADED RIGHT FOR US?
NOT FOR LONG.
THERE'S A COMBINED TASKFORCE ON ITS WAY TO MEET IT.
SO YOU'VE DECLARED WAR ON A GLACIER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE LAST CHUNK OF THE GLACIER,
AND THEY'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ON IT.
NOW GET YOUR ASSES INSIDE BEFORE I HAVE YOU ARRESTED!
GO!
GO!
THAT'S THE LAST OF THE EXPLOSIVES, MAJOR.
GOOD, GOOD!
ALL EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED.
ROGER THAT.
THE CHARGES ARE IN PLACE!
TAKE US BACK HOME!
COPY THAT.
PREPARE FOR EXTRACTION.
ROGER THAT.
HEY, NELSON.
GRAB THE COMPUTER.
I WANT TO FIND OUT
IF WE CAN CONNECT TO A SATELLITE AT THIS ALTITUDE.
GOT IT.
SHOULD TAKE A SEC.
RECEPTION BLOWS UP HERE.
I GOT A SIGNAL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO CONNECT UP TO THE NOAA WEBSITE.
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT GLACIER IS RIGHT NOW.
GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE LOGIN?
LOGIN IS USERNAME JULIA,
PASSWORD, NELSON.
DAD, THAT'S LAME.
THAT IS SWEET.
LAME OR NOT, OPEN UP THE TRACKING PROGRAM.
NOW RUN THE SIMULATION WITH THE SAME COORDINATES,
BUT PUT IN OUR GPS LOCATION RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW FAR AWAY WE ARE FROM THAT GLACIER.
OKAY, IT'S 50 MILES BEHIND US.
IT'S MOVING AT 200 MILES AN HOUR.
WHAT?
HOW CAN A GLACIER MOVE AT 200 MILES PER HOUR?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE DOES EITHER.
CAN WE OUTRUN THAT?
ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT ON TIME?
LET'S FIND OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WE'RE ICING UP.
DOESN'T THIS MODEL HAVE DE-ICERS?
NO.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FLY LOW IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
WE'RE BURNING FUEL LIKE CRAZY.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK OUTSIDE
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY KIND OF PRIVATE AIRFIELD,
A CROP DUSTING OPERATION, ANYTHING.
YOU GUYS FINDING ANYTHING?
HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM NEW YORK?
CAN'T BE MORE THAN 100 MILES.
YOU GUYS SEEING ANYTHING?
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
THIS VISIBILITY SUCKS BALLS.
NELSON!
OKAY, GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE GONNA GO LOWER.
ANYTHING?
NOPE, NOTHING.
WE'RE STILL COLLECTING A LOT OF ICE.
I MAY HAVE TO PUT HER DOWN AT ANY TIME, GUYS.
HOW MUCH MORE ICE CAN THIS THING TAKE?
NOT A LOT.
THESE HEADWINDS ARE KILLING US.
WE COULD WALK THERE FASTER.
HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT?
ABOUT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.
I'M GONNA TRY TO LAND HER AT NEWARK OR LA GUARDIA.
WILL THEY ALLOW US TO LAND WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN?
WELL, I'LL JUST RADIO AHEAD
AND TELL THEM WE'RE AN EMERGENCY.
THEY HAVE TO LET US LAND.
WHAT IF THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HEAR US?
OH, CRAP!
Teri:
WHAT?
WE JUST RAN OUT OF FUEL IN THE RIGHT FUEL TANK!
OKAY, GUYS, STRAP YOURSELVES IN.
GET READY.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING.
REALLY, BILL?
YES!
GET READY!
GOD, LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
WELL, AT LEAST WE GET FREE COOKIES.
YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND US?
I HOPE SO.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?
DAD'S IN NORTHERN EUROPE NEAR OSLO.
IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST HIT.
IT'S OKAY.
I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU.
OKAY, YOU GUYS.
WE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LAND,
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO NEWARK.
WE'RE ENTERING INTO THE NEW YORK AIR CORRIDOR NOW.
I'M GONNA GET ON THE RADIO
AND SEE IF ANYBODY'S THERE LISTENING.
GIVE ME THE RADIO THERE, NELSON.
NEWARK TOWER, THIS IS CESSNA...
WHERE'S THE FLIGHT NUMBER?
GIVE ME THE FLIGHT NUMBER.
THIS IS CESSNA NUMBER NOVEMBER NINER, NINER, 7-2-5.
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
DO YOU COPY?
CAN THEY EVEN HEAR US?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND A HOLE AND SLIP INTO IT.
BUCKLE UP, GUYS.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE GROUND
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, SO HOLD ON.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK AROUND
TO SEE IF YOU CAN SEE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT
THAT MIGHT BE LANDING WITHOUT TOWER PERMISSION, OKAY?
BRACE YOURSELVES!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH?
OKAY.
WE'RE DOWN.
OKAY, OKAY.
LET'S GET OUT, GUYS.
COME ON.
COME ON OUT.
COME ON, GUYS.
HERE WE GO.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WELL, I GUESS WE GOT OUT JUST IN TIME.
HEY, GUYS, LOOK.
IT'S NEW YORK.
WE DID IT!
ALMOST THERE.
YEAH. [LAUGHS]
DID YOU CRASH THAT ONE EIGHTY?
YEAH.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I GOT ALL THE INSURANCE INFORMATION IF YOU NEED IT.
IF A CRASHED CESSNA WAS ALL WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT,
I'D CALL IT A GOOD DAY.
COME WITH ME.
LET'S GET YOU INTO SOMEPLACE SAFE.
COLONEL SINOR, THIS IS COMMAND.
WE ARE LESS THAN 30 SECONDS FROM DETONATION.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE ALL CLEAR AND STANDING BY.
GIVE ME A LONG COUNT, CAPTAIN.
FIRE!
[LAUGHS]
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
WERE YOU GUYS HEADED INTO MANHATTAN?
YEAH, BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR DAUGHTER.
I'M SORRY.
NO ONE'S GETTING IN AND OUT OF NEW YORK ALIVE.
JUST STAY HERE.
THE NATIONAL GUARD'S GONNA BE HERE TO GET YOU.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT--
OH!
OH!
COME ON, GET BACK!
GET BACK!
WE JUST GOT TO STAY AWAY FROM TALL BUILDINGS
WITH LOTS OF GLASS, GOT IT?
DAD, WE'RE GOING TO MANHATTAN.
POINT TAKEN.
SO HOW WE GONNA GET THERE?
WE GOT TO GET OURSELVES ANOTHER CAR
AND THEN JUST DRIVE INTO THE CITY.
AND GO WHERE?
TO THE DORM.
THE DORM?
SHE'S NOT AT THE DORM AND YOU KNOW THAT.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE SHE GOT OUR MESSAGE.
WHAT, TO GO TO FLORIDA?
LOOK, SHE MAY NOT BE IN NEW YORK,
BUT WE HAVE START THERE.
FROM THERE, MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
SOME SORT OF CLUE WHERE SHE--
ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE?
HEY, GUYS!
ARE WE GOING OR WHAT?
WERE THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.
LET'S JUST GO.
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET HOLD OF HER AGAIN.
IF WE'RE IN JERSEY, HOW FAR IS NEW YORK?
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER.
WE'RE COMING UP TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.
NO SIGNAL.
IT JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY NOW.
IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH.
WE JUST NEED TO GET UNDER THE GW.
I'LL TRY TO GET THE GPS RUNNING.
IS EVERYONE TRYING TO GET TO NEW YORK?
LOOK AT THAT MESS.
NELSON, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO THE BRIDGE.
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN YOUR CAR AROUND.
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH HERE.
WE HAVE TO GET TO MANHATTAN.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE'S GOING OVER THERE.
NO, OUR DAUGHTER IS THERE, AND WE NEED TO PICK HER UP.
I DON'T CARE IF THE POPE'S OVER THERE.
NO ONE'S GOING IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER SOON ANYWAY.
PLEASE JUST LET US GO.
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.
WASHINGTON BRIDGE, IT'S OUT.
WOW!
THE AIR FORCE IS COMING IN FOR THEIR LAST AIR STRIKE.
LET'S HOPE THAT DOES IT,
OR MAYBE NONE OF US WILL GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW, BILL?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THINKING SOMETHING.
WHAT?
OH, IT'S JUST THAT
REMEMBER WHEN THE KIDS WERE REALLY, REALLY YOUNG
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE COULD PUT
SOME SORT OF TRACKING DEVICE ON THEM,
WE'D ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE INVENTED THAT DEVICE.
DAMN IT!
WAIT, WAIT, GUYS!
WE DO HAVE A TRACKING DEVICE!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, NELSON?
OH, OF COURSE!
OF COURSE WHAT?
EVEN IF WE CAN'T TALK TO HER ON HER PHONE,
WE CAN TRACK HER PHONE.
REALLY?
WE CAN DO THAT?
YES.
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?
DON'T ASK.
I GOT IT!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
NEW JERSEY?
SHE'S HERE!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
OH, MY GOD, BILL.
WHERE?
UM...
FOUR MILES THAT WAY.
TWO MORE MILES.
HURRY, BILL!
OKAY, PEOPLE, THIS IS IT!
STAY BACK.
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT--
HOW FAR ARE WE?
1.7 MILES.
WHICH WAY DO WE GO?
THERE'S GONNA BE A DEAD END ON YOUR LEFT,
SO WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT.
OKAY, GUYS, HERE WE GO.
HOLD ON A SECOND!
T MINUS 2 MINUTES FOR LAUNCH.
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH THIS.
HOW FAR AWAY IS SHE?
DAD, SHE'S JUST TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
OKAY, WE'RE GOING ON FOOT, GUYS.
COME ON.
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S THE GPS SAY?
SHE'S THAT WAY!
ONE MORE BLOCK THIS WAY!
JUST OVER A BLOCK!
OH!
DAD, MY PHONE!
GOT TO GET MY PHONE TO FIND HER!
NELSON, LISTEN TO ME.
WE'LL FIND HER.
FORGET IT, FORGET IT!
WE DON'T HAVE TIME!
LET'S GO.

WE GOT HER.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET ME SEE YOU.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
DAD, THIS IS LOGAN.
HI, LOGAN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GET TO SAFETY, GUYS.
COME ON.
Nelson:
DAD, DRIVE!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
THE BRIDGES ARE DOWN, STREETS ARE BLOCKED, THE RIVER'S FROZEN.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
DADDY?
Logan:
ARE YOU DRIVING ON THE HUDSON RIVER?
IS IT GONNA HOLD?
Nelson:
IT DIDN'T LAST TIME.
Julia:
LAST TIME?
WHAT?
Nelson:
YOU SEE THAT?
THOSE ARE F-16s GOING IN!
Teri:
WHAT WAS THAT?
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING BIG JUST BLEW UP.
Teri:
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE CANNOT KEEP GOING ON LIKE THIS!
I KNOW!
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY OFF THE RIVER!
ANY IDEAS?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
OKAY, IF WE CAN MAKE IT.
GLACIER APPEARS TO BE BREAKING UP.
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT!
LET'S GO!
OKAY, GO ON THROUGH!
COME ON THROUGH!
LET'S GO!
NO, NO, NO, FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS!
KEEP GOING!
HURRY!
OKAY, GET DOWN.
GET DOWN.
HONEY.
HEAR ANYTHING?
NO.
IS IT DONE?
HOLD ON.
COME ON.
COME ON UP.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
OH.
BLUE TEAM TO BASE CAMP.
GO, BLUE TEAM.
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY SEEMS TO BE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY.
I'M HEADING NORTH ON THE SHELF TO COLLECT MORE DATA.
COPY.
BLUE TEAM, REPORTS SHOW
THE HEKLA VOLCANO IS HAVING IMMENSE SEISMIC READINGS.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.
COPY THAT.
BASE CAMP, WE'RE SEEING INTENSE MAGNA FLOW
RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE RANGE.
IF IT KEEPS INCREASING,
WE MAY HAVE TO EVACUATE THE AREA NOW,
ALL THE LOCAL AREAS.
BASE CAMP, IF THE WHOLE RANGE STARTS ERUPTING,
WE'RE LOOKING AT A WHOLE GLACIER DETACHING FROM THE SHELF.
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
CAN I REALLY TALK TO BASE ON THIS THING?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
TRY A LOWER BAND.
THERE YOU GO.
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
THIS IS 6SNL7 CALLING SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
JUST CAN'T GET IT.
THERE'S TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE.
I'M GOING TO TAKE DOWN A PLANE WITH THIS THING.
BETTER NOT.
HEY, DID YOU PACK YOUR GORTEX?
HELLO?
JULIA?
JULIA?
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU HEARD ME A SECOND AGO.
MOM PACKED IT.
WELL, GOOD, I'M GLAD.
YOU KNOW, IT GETS COLD IN NEW YORK, JULIA.
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
THIS IS 6SNL7 TO SUMMIT CAMP.
DO YOU READ?
SUMMIT CAMP, COME IN.
DAD, I THINK I JUST GOT 'EM.
OH, GREAT.
6SNL7, COME IN.
DAD, I'M GONNA MISS MY FLIGHT!
HOLD ON.
DAD, THIS IS MY TERMINAL.
DAD!
6SNL7, COME IN.
THIS IS SUMMIT CAMP.
GO AHEAD.
DIVYA?
HEY, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I'M BRINGING SOME NEW INSTRUMENTS NEXT WEEK.
BILL, HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE DATA WE SENT?
NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT IN THE OFFICE.
I'M DROPPING JULIA OFF AT THE AIRPORT.
WHY?
WHAT'S UP?
WE'RE EVACUATING.
THE REST OF THE TEAM IS GONE ALREADY.
I'M THE LAST MAN STANDING.
EVACUATING?
WHY?
DAD, I SHOULD JUST WALK FROM HERE.
HEKLA WENT BERSERK.
THERE'S A HUGE PRESSURE BUILDUP.
THE ENDURANCE READINGS ARE OFF THE CHART.
THE ENTIRE HEKLA LINE IS ERUPTING.
THERE IS PRESSURE BUILDING UP EVERYWHERE.
BILL, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
PRESSURE BUILDING UP WHERE?
AT WHAT SITE?
I'M TRYING.
GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE SEEING ACTIVITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE RANGE.
WAIT, AT ALL THE SITES?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, DIVYA.
I CHECKED WITH THE OTHER STATIONS.
NO ONE'S EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
I SENT YOU EVERYTHING WE GOT
BEFORE THE CENTERS MELTED DOWN, BILL.
LOOK AT THE DATA!
NO, I'M NOT AT THE OFFICE.
I'LL BE THERE IN AN HOUR.
PULL UP THE COMPUTER SIMULATION.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
DIVYA?
OKAY, I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL NOW.
NO NEED TO SAY GOODBYE OR ANYTHING.
REYKJANES RIDGE?
YEAH.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
MAGNA FLOW RATE?
F7.
DIVYA, CAN YOU READ ME?
RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK AROUND CHRISTMASTIME
UNLESS I DECIDE TO STAY IN NEW YORK FOREVER.
DIVYA, COME IN.
DIVYA, IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME,
I WILL LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I WILL CONTACT YOU
AS SOON AS I GET TO THE OFFICE.
DIVYA, ARE YOU THERE?
6SNL7, COME IN.
5-3-7-6-E-9.
6SNL7, DO YOU COPY?
SIR, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
IT'S FINE.
I'M JUST DROPPING MY DAUGHTER OFF.
WE'LL BE TWO MINUTES.
6SNL7, DO YOU READ?
SIR?
OH, MY GOD.
COME IN, 6SNL7.
DO YOU READ?
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
SIR?
HART, DO YOU READ ME?
YES, GO AHEAD, DIVYA.
I READ YOU.
GO AHEAD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
SIR, THIS IS A NO PARKING ZONE.
THIS IS LOADING AND UNLOADING ONLY.
I NEED YOU TO MOVE YOUR--
THIS IS MASSIVE!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS ON FIRE!
EVERY SINGLE VOLCANO IS ERUPTING!
SAY AGAIN.
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
THE ENTIRE ICE SHELF IS FRACTURING!
IT'S 1,000 MILES LONG!
BILL, DO YOU READ ME?
SOMETHING ABOUT THE VOLCANO.
IS NOT MOVING.
DAD, WE NEED TO GO.
LOOK.
YEAH.
WHERE'S JULIA?
SHE LEFT, LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.
WHAT?
AH, CRAP.
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE, DAD?
NO, NO, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED HER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR SISTER.
MOM'S GONNA KILL YOU.
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.
DAD, WHAT IS DR. CHANDRA SAYING ABOUT THE GLACIER?
DID IT CALF?
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT IT SOUNDED A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT.
THAT WOULD BE SICK.
SICK, HUH?
100 %.
WHY DON'T YOU BRING UP THE SIMULATION AGAIN
ON THE PARAMETER SCREEN, OKAY?
OKAY, LET'S SEE.
OKAY, USING THESE NUMBERS,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH
FOR THE ICE FLOW PROJECTION, OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ROY?
BILL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT IN THE FIELD.
I JUST SPOKE WITH DIVYA,
AND HE HAD SENT YOU SOME DATA.
DID YOU RECEIVE IT?
YEAH, THE HEKLA VOLCANO JUST ERUPTED.
NO, BUT IT SOUNDED MORE THAN THE HEKLA,
LIKE THE WHOLE RANGE WENT UP.
WE KNOW.
HART, GO HOME.
WE'VE GOT THIS.
I COULD BE PULLING MAPS OR CRUNCHING NUMBERS.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SEND ME HOME?
BILL, WE DON'T NEED YOU.
ROY, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR 15 YEARS.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?
BILL, I HAVE JUST PUT CYNTHIA AND MY KIDS
ON A PLANE TO MEXICO.
YOU DO THE SAME.
WE HAVE GOT CHUNKS OF ICE
FALLING ALL OVER CANADA.
IN 19 HOURS, THE BULK OF THE GLACIER
IS GOING TO HIT NORTH AMERICA.
BILL, GET YOUR FAMILY OUT NOW.
WHAT DID YOU GET?
IT WON'T LET ME INPUT THIS DATA.
OKAY.
WELL, LET'S OPEN UP A TERMINAL WINDOW
AND WE'LL ENTER SANDBOX MODE.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, IT'S A MODE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO ENTER IN VARIABLES THAT ARE THEORETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS WE GOT TO GET YOUR MOM.
WHY?
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU ON THE WAY.
HOLD ON.
EXCUSE ME, SENATOR.
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
BUT I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CYRUS
OVER AT AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES,
AND HE SAID THAT ALL THE FLIGHTS ARE GROUNDED
BECAUSE OF THE VOLCANIC ASH FLOW.
GET QUINCY IN DC AND ASK HIM
IF THEY'RE GONNA POSTPONE THE SUMMIT.
YES, SENATOR.
HEY.
YOUR DAUGHTER'S FLYING OUT TODAY.
YES.
STARTING COLLEGE.
NYU.
TERI, THESE VOLCANOES ARE IN GREENLAND.
JULIA'S FLYING INTO NEW YORK.
SHE'LL BE FINE.
I HOPE SO.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, SIR.
THANK YOU.
TERI?
TERI?
TERI?
BILL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH US RIGHT NOW.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JULIA?
NO, NO.
JULIA IS FINE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
PLEASE DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS TALKING TO DIVYA ABOUT THE PETERMANN GLACIER.
DIVYA?
PETERMANN?
WHAT IS THAT?
HI, BILL.
HI, SENATOR.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT WITH JULIA?
EVERYTHING'S FINE WITH JULIA, SENATOR.
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
BUT YOU NEED TO LEAVE TOWN RIGHT NOW, SIR.
BILL!
BILL WAS JUST LEAVING, SENATOR.
SO SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
LOOK, THERE IS A HUGE GLACIER COMING OUR WAY,
AND IT'S COMING AT US REALLY, REALLY QUICK.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF TOWN!
LISTEN, I HAVE A SUMMIT MEETING.
NO, NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND.
MOM, MOM!
THIS IS TRUE!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF MAINE.
REALLY?
YOU'RE GONNA BRING OUR SON INTO ALL YOUR WEATHER--
IT'S TRUE!
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SO SORRY.
HI, JOSH.
HI.
HEY, BILL.
I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYBODY
ON THE PHONE ABOUT THE SUMMIT.
NOT EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE IS PICKING UP.
YOU'D BETTER BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
JOSH, GO HOME.
WHAT?
NO, DON'T GO HOME.
GET OUT OF MAINE.
GO AS FAR SOUTH AS YOU CAN!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
DON'T SCARE HIM LIKE THAT!
EAGLE CLIFF, FLIGHT DECK.
REQUESTING SAT-COM COORDINATES.
OVER.
HOLD FOR GPS.
GLACIER LOCATED.
58-42 NORTH, 39-02 WEST,
BEARING 210.
OVER.
COPY THAT.
EAGLE CLIFF FLIGHT DECK CLEAR.
FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0 CLEAR TO TAKE OFF.
ROGER, I'M GETTING A VISUAL NOW.
THIS IS FOXTROT, WHISKEY, 8-7-0.
IT'S HEADING TOWARDS NEWFOUNDLAND.
WHY IS IT GETTING DARKER?
THE WEATHER'S CHANGING.
DAD, ARE YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON?
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
I NEED TO CALL JULIA.
CAN WE GO HOME FIRST?
I NEED TO GET MY LAPTOP.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF TOWN.
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
DON'T THEY HAVE WI-FI ON AIRPLANES?
MAYBE IF SHE WAS FLYING FIRST CLASS.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FLYING AT ALL TODAY.
NOT TODAY.
DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S GONNA BE LANDING SOON.
WE'LL GET HOLD OF HER.
IT'LL BE OKAY.
WHOA.
USE WORDS, NELSON.
I DON'T THINK I CAN.
WHAT?
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING BACK HOME.
WHY NOT?
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.
LOOK AT THE CLOUDS.
WHAT CAN DO THAT?
GLACIERS.
REALLY, REALLY FAST GLACIERS.
OKAY, SO WHERE WE GOING?
NEW YORK.
TAKE US ABOUT 7, 8 HOURS.
HEY.
HEY!
I MISSED YOU.
I MISSED YOU, TOO.
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG.
TRAFFIC WAS A MESS.
I KNOW.
THEY GROUNDED ALL THE FLIGHTS.
THEY DID?
DAMN.
MM-HMM.
GUESS WE'RE GONNA BE HERE A WHILE, HUH?
WELL, THAT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING.
OOH, I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
OH, CRAP.
I'M SORRY.
WHO'S THAT?
NO ONE.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE DORM AND FOOL AROUND.
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
JULIA, WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU AT YOUR DORM, OKAY, HONEY?
SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE DORM, JUST STAY THERE, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU THERE.
ALL RIGHT, BIG HUGS, AND LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU.
BYE.
ARE YOU SURE THAT NEW YORK IS SAFE?
BILL?
HOW STUPID.
WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE HER FLY AND MEET US DOWN IN FLORIDA?
SWEETHEART, EVERYTHING IS GROUNDED.
I SAY WE STAY ON PLAN
AND WE JUST MEET HER AT THE DORM.
FINE.
OH, MY GOSH!
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE OKAY.
DAD, I THINK IT'S COMING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT!
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS?
NO.
THE GLACIERS ARE MAKING IT SNOW IN MAINE?
IT'S SUMMER.
CAN YOU JUST GET US OUT OF MAINE NOW?
HOW BIG DO THESE GLACIERS HAVE TO BE TO DO THIS?
BILL?
CRAP.
DAD, DOES THIS SNOW MEAN THE GLACIER'S GETTING CLOSE?
BILL, IT HAS TO BECAUSE THE CLOUDS ARE LOOKING MASSIVE.
I BET THIS GLACIER IS ENORMOUS,
LIKE THE WHOLE SHELF.
YEAH.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO.
I GOT TO FIND A WAY AROUND THIS TRAFFIC.
NELSON, JUMP ON THE GPS AND FIND ME AN ALTERNATE ROUTE.
ON IT.
BILL, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW!
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE GLACIER IS CLOSE.
THOSE MILITARY PLANES?
F-16s.
NELSON, FOCUS.
GPS.
TARGET IS 400 MILES OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST
AND IS NOW IN RANGE.
SIR, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
I SEE NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, TARGET IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
NEGATIVE, ALPHA FOXTROT.
THERE IS NOTHING.
DELTA BRAVO ONE, LOOK AGAIN.
HOLY SH--
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
PULL UP!
DELTA BRAVO ONE, DO YOU READ ME?
DELTA BRAVO ONE?
ALPHA FOXTROT, THIS IS CONTROL.
FIRE SEQUENCE IN 3... 2... 1...
FIRE!
OH, MY GOD!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?
IS IT GONE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
I THINK WE OUTRAN IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BILL?
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE?
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST PULL OVER.
NO, NOT YET, NOT YET.
EVERYTHING IS GONE, ISN'T IT?
JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT, NELSON?
EVERYTHING.
GOD, MY FRIENDS.
I NEED TO GET ONLINE!
NO, NO.
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT, OKAY?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!
NO, THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT!
MOM, YOUR CELL PHONE.
IT'S JULIA.
JULIA?
JULIA!
MOM!
OH, MY GOD.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?
WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.
DAD'S HERE AND NELSON'S HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE DON'T KNOW.
THE NEWS IS SAYING THAT BANGOR JUST GOT DESTROYED.
TELL HER WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
WE'RE COMING TO NEW YORK.
MOM, CAN I JUST TALK TO HER?
TELL HER THAT WE'LL BE AT HER DORM
IN SIX HOURS FROM NOW.
WE'RE GONNA BE AT YOUR DORM IN SIX HOURS, OKAY?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
JULIA?
JULIA?
HELLO?
LET ME TALK TO HER.
JULIA, LISTEN.
IF THE WEATHER BREAKS, HEAD SOUTH TO FLORIDA
TO YOUR AUNT KISSY'S HOUSE.
THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU GO, THE SAFER IT IS.
JULIA?
HELLO?
JULIA?
HELLO?
SWEETHEART, IF YOU CAN...
MOM?
LOST IT.
DAD, I WANTED TO TALK TO HER.
SORRY, BUDDY.
WELL, WHAT?
MY PARENTS ARE COMING FOR ME.
I THINK THEY WANT US TO STAY AT THE DORM.
WELL, WE SHOULD GET GOING THEN.
YEAH.
IT'S GETTING COLD FAST.
COME ON!
EVACUATION IS MANDATORY
IN MOST NORTHEAST COASTAL TOWNS.
WE'VE BEEN INFORMED,
FOLLOWING AN ONSITE EVALUATION,
THE PRESIDENT WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE
WITH THE MOST CURRENT UPDATE.
THE MILITARY CURRENTLY HAS AWAC IN THE AIR
ASSESSING THE THREAT.
DROPPING OUT AT 400.
TARGET IS BREAKING UP,
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
SAY AGAIN, JOHNNY BRAVO.
TARGET IS SEPARATING INTO MULTIPLE SECTIONS
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT
HEADING SOUTH DOWN THE COAST.
WOW.
CLOUD COVER'S JUST SO THICK,
IT LOOKS LIKE NIGHT.
I'M GETTING NOTHING.
I'M TRYING TO CALL HER BACK.
LOOK, SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY, OKAY?
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE OKAY.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF THE SENATOR.
CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYBODY.
DAD, YOU SAID THE PETERMANN GLACIER WAS HOW BIG?
LET'S SEE, THE LAST CALVING HAPPENED IN 2010.
THAT WAS ABOUT 100 SQUARE MILES,
WHICH IS ROUGHLY FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN,
AND THAT WAS ONLY 8 % OF THE GLACIER.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S THE WHOLE GLACIER.
WITH ENOUGH SPEED, WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT COULD DO?
WHAT?
DAD!
WHICH WAY'S YOUR ROOM?
THIS WAY.
COME ON.
KAREN!
OH, MY GOD, JULIA.
I CAN'T GET HOLD OF ANYONE IN MAINE.
JUST TRY AGAIN, OKAY?
IT TOOK ME THREE TRIES.
KEEP TRYING.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
KEEP TRYING.
IS THERE A BASEMENT?
NO, THERE'D BE NO RECEPTION IN THE BASEMENT.
I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.
COME ON, JULIA!
NO, THAT'S A MISTAKE.
NO, JULIA, WE HAVE TO GO!
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HURRY!
PUT YOUR JACKET ON.
WE GOT TO GO.
BUT MY DAD SAID TO STAY HERE.
I KNOW.
CALL HIM AND TELL HIM,
BUT WE AREN'T STAYING HERE, JULIA!
MOM!
DAD!
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE!
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN WE--
I LOST THE SIGNAL.
YOU THINK THE MESSAGE WENT THROUGH?
I HOPE SO.
SO THEN WHAT NOW?
HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THE CITY?
EVERYTHING'S SHUT DOWN.
WE GET TO ONE OF THE BRIDGES AND GET ACROSS THE RIVER!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
JULIA, WHAT ABOUT THE SUBWAY?
THE SUBWAYS ARE SHUT DOWN, TOO.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIN, JULIA.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TUNNELS.
WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH ONE OF THOSE.
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'LL WORK?
WOULD YOU RATHER STAY UP HERE?
COME ON!
OH...
OH.
YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY, DAD.
YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE OKAY.
WE'LL WORK OUR WAY OUT.
COME ON.
NELSON'S OKAY.
WE'RE GOOD.
THE SUN IS BREAKING THROUGH.
COME ON.
EASY, EASY.
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST A CUT.
COME ON.
GET NELSON.
COME ON, SWEETIE.
NELSON?
YOU OKAY?
BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
BROKEN BONES?
NO.
ANYTHING?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, OKAY.
GOOD JOB.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE, DAD.
GOOD JOB.
OKAY, LET'S GET MOVING.
LET'S GO.
WE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.
KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CAR.
SEE IF THAT VAN WORKS.
OKAY, GUYS, COME ON.
COME ON.
SO COLD.
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.
OKAY, GUYS, GET IN.
GET IN, HONEY.
LOOK FOR SOME KEYS.
I'M GONNA CHECK THIS OUT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
IT'S SO COLD.
WHERE'S DAD GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.
HELLO?
HELLO?
WHERE'S DAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'LL BE BACK, THOUGH, HONEY.
MOM, THE KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION.
OH, GOOD.
LET'S START IT.
COME ON.
TRY AGAIN.
YES!
OKAY, GOOD.
IT'S A MESS IN HERE.
SMELLS LIKE SHIT.
OH, GOOD.
YOU GOT IT RUNNING.
YEAH.
OKAY, BAD NEWS.
THERE'S A BIG PILEUP.
WE GOT TO FIND A WAY--
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I THINK IT'S MANURE OR SOMETHING.
IT SMELLS AWFUL.
MANURE?
LIKE FERTILIZER?
YEAH.
WHAT KIND?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HONEY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT.
EXCELLENT.
OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHERE'D HE GO?
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE DAD COMES BACK SOON.
OKAY, INSIDE.
GO.
OKAY, HEADS DOWN.
HEADS DOWN.
HERE WE GO.
HEADS DOWN.
OKAY, WHY?
JUST A LITTLE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.
WHAT KIND OF SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, BILL?
THE KIND THAT GOES BOOM.
SEE, WHEN YOU TAKE AMMONIUM NITRATE
AND YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DIESEL FUEL, YOU GET...
WHOA!
DAD, WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO DO THAT?
IN SCIENCE CLASS.
OH, GOD, BILL.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION, I THINK.
I DO.
I HAVE PHONE RECEPTION.
PULL OVER.
PULL OVER RIGHT NOW!
MOM GOT A RECEPTION?
YEAH.
WELL?
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
IT'S JULIA.
WHERE WE GOING TO GO?
MOM, DAD, WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
NELSON, GET ON THE SHORTWAVE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL--
SOMETHING BAD HAS HIT HER DORM.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PLAYING IT AGAIN.
MOM, DAD, IT'S JULIA.
WE'RE NOT SAFE--
SOMETHING'S HIT THE DORM REALLY BAD AND SHE'S TRYING TO GET OUT.
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
THE DORMS AREN'T SAFE.
SHE'S SAYING SHE CANNOT GET OUT OF NEW YORK CITY.
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?
IT'S A SONIC BOOM.
10 BIRDS IN FORMATION.
THEY'RE GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER.
CAN THEY DO THAT?
CAN THEY BOMB A GLACIER, BILL?
YEAH, THEY COULD DO THAT,
BUT THEY'D NEED TO HIT IT WITH A NUCLEAR BOMB
TO STOP THIS THING.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THEY SAID BOSTON'S GONNA BE HIT NEXT
IF THEY DON'T STOP IT.
BOSTON?
WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
OSCAR CHARLIE AND DELTA X-RAY APPROACHING TARGET.
ROGER, OSCAR CHARLIE.
ORDERING NUCLEAR PAYLOAD ACTIVE.
NUKES ARE HOT, WAITING FOR COUNTDOWN.
MY SON WAS BORN IN BOSTON, SO LET'S MELT THIS ICE.
ROGER THAT.
FIRE ONE!
OSCAR CHARLIE, DO YOU HAVE A VISUAL?
CHECKING NOW.
COMMAND 483.
NUKES DEPLOYED,
BUT THEY HAVE NO VISUAL EFFECT.
WAITING ON NEXT COMMAND.
EVERYONE LOOKS SO SCARED.
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
LOOK, WE GOT THIS BIG EMPTY VAN,
ALL THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP.
I FIGURE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL OPEN UP A DOOR--
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WE NEED TO GET HER, AND SHE IS OUR PRIORITY.
SHE'S OUR TOP PRIORITY, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO NEW YORK.
I FIGURE WE CAN HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE
RIDE WITH US TO NEW YORK.
IT'LL TAKE TWO MINUTES--
NO!
TWO MINUTES?
YEAH, TWO MINUTES.
HONEY, WE JUST CAN'T LEAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
HONEY?
MOM, DAD...
HEAR THAT?
EVERYBODY OKAY?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
I THINK WE MADE IT.
LET'S KEEP GOING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
BOSTON'S BEEN HIT!
THE GLACIER'S LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM US!
IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US!
IT'S TOO LATE.
WE HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS NOT TO COME.
ALL THE CIRCUITS ARE BUSY.
NO SURPRISE THERE.
KEEP IT ON.
WE'LL TRY AGAIN LATER.
WE GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
COME ON.
BABE, I KNOW WHERE WE ARE.
WE COULD TAKE A TUNNEL.
WE TRIED THEM ALL.
THEY'RE CLOSED!
TRUST ME!
GO, GO.
HURRY.
HURRY!
BE CAREFUL.
CAREFUL.
WE USED TO GO THIS WAY WHEN WE WERE, LIKE, 12.
JUST NEED TO FIND A LIGHT.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WE REALLY HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE?
YEAH.
IT'S SAFER THAN UP THERE.
OH, GOD.
WHAT IF MY PARENTS TRY TO MAKE IT TO NEW YORK?
THEY'RE GOING TO GET YOUR MESSAGE.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF--
THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE.
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIND SOME GAS SOON.
I CAN LOG ON AND FIND US A GAS STATION.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, HONEY.
POWER GRID IS DOWN, BUDDY.
THAT MEANS NO WI-FI, NO GAS STATIONS.
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
WE JUST NEED TO FIND HIM SOME FOOD
AND LET'S FIND SOME GAS.
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S JUST START LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.
DAD, LOOK!
YOU CAN SIPHON GAS.
GREAT IDEA.
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S START LOOKING FOR CARS,
HOPEFULLY FILLED WITH FOOD.
HANG IN THERE, NELSON.
WE'RE ALMOST IN NEW YORK, OKAY?
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN, BILL.
I THINK I SEE SOME CARS IN THE DISTANCE.
IT'S JUST SO CREEPY
WHEN IT GETS DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
HONEY, JUST GET WHAT WE NEED AND GET BACK.
BE CAREFUL.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S IN THERE.
JUST STAY THERE.
WHY?
JUST STAY THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.
I GOT THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO PEE.
OKAY.
I'M GLAD THAT WAS YOU AND NOT ME.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
IT'S WORKING.
THAT IS SOME STRONG STUFF.
WHEW!
HEY, WE'RE IN CONNECTICUT.
HONEY?
I'M NOT STOPPING.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.
HEY, NELSON, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO PULL UP ANYTHING ON THE GPS?
NOT REALLY.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT?
HAND 'EM OVER.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE BACK THERE, CHEF NELSON?
OH, MAN!
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU GUYS.
YEAH, SURE YOU WERE.
DINNER?
THANKS.
THANK YOU, HONEY.
NELSON, HOW MUCH LONGER TO NEW YORK?
ABOUT TWO HOURS.
YOU THINK SHE'S STILL AT THE DORM?
I'M SURE YOUR SISTER'S FINE.
SHE'S A SMART GIRL AND SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
IT'S THIS WAY.
YOU SURE WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN HERE IN 10 YEARS.
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN AND TRUST ME, OKAY?
IT'S THE ONLY WAY, JULIA.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING DEEPER, THOUGH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER IT IS, IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
COME ON.
WOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GETTING WORSE.
COME ON.
LET'S KEEP MOVING.
DAD, I GOT A FREQUENCY.
GO HENRY. 11-41 AND 44th AND...
INTERSECTION.

COPY THAT.
THANK YOU.
YOU OKAY?
DO YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE?
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE.
SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
WE'RE ALMOST TO NEW YORK,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN.
WE'RE GONNA GET TO SEE HER AGAIN, OKAY?
OH, CRAP.
STAY HERE.
ARE WE IN NEW YORK?
NOT YET, HONEY.
NOT YET.
HEY!
HEY!
IS YOUR CAR WORKING?
NO, IT'S OUT OF GAS.
OH, GAS, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BUT YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU'RE STUCK, BUT YOU'RE OKAY, RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
RIGHT.
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
NO REASON.
HEY, HEY!
ARE YOU ALONE?
HEY, ARE YOU ALONE?
'CAUSE I'M ALONE.

OH, THAT'S COOL, THAT'S COOL.
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY COLD OUT HERE, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOMEPLACE WARM.

I'LL GET A CAR.
I'LL GO TO CALIFORNIA.

MAYBE HAVE TEQUILAS ON THE BEACH.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.
NICE MEETING YOU.
NO, NO, HEY, HEY, HEY!
I'M THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND I COULD GO TO CALIFORNIA TOGETHER.
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK.
OH, YEAH, NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, NEW YORK'S REALLY COLD,

I DON'T WANT YOUR FOOD.
HEY, WHAT KIND OF FOOD YOU GOT?
I NEED TO GET INTO THE VAN.
YEAH, YEAH.

LET'S RUN!
WATCH OUT!
COME ON, GUYS.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
WE DID IT.
IT'S SNOWING AGAIN.
OKAY, LET'S GET ANOTHER VEHICLE.
LET'S TRY THIS WAY.
COME ON.
WHERE ARE WE?
IT'S THE LINCOLN TUNNEL.
WE CAN TAKE THIS ALL THE WAY TO NEW JERSEY.
AND HOW FAR IS THAT?
IT'S ABOUT A MILE.
COME ON.
COME ON.
DAD, I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP GOING.
GOT TO KEEP MOVING.
IF WE STOP, WE DIE.
LET'S JUST GO.
HONEY, IS THAT A HOUSE?
SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.
COME ON.
CAN WE GO?
YEP, LET'S TRY IT.
COME ON.
IT'S SO COLD.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW, GUYS.
IT'S SO COLD.
HELLO!
HELLO!
COME ON IN, GUYS.
SIT DOWN.
GET WARM.
HELLO?
I DIDN'T SEE A CAR OUT FRONT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY LEFT HERE PRETTY QUICKLY.
HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE IF YOU FIND SOME CLOTHES,
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOME FOOD,
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
HELLO?
HELLO?
DON'T WORRY, BABY.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU, JULIA.
HERE, HONEY, I FOUND THESE UPSTAIRS.
OH, GREAT.
HERE YOU GO.
SHOULD WE JUST LET HIM SLEEP?
NO, NO, NO.
WE GOT TO GET GOING.
IT MAY LOOK LIKE NIGHT,
BUT IT'S ONLY 3:00 p.m.
COME ON, WAKE UP, NELSON.
IT'S TIME TO GO.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE GOT TO DO IT ON FOOT.
GET GOING AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND ONE ON THE WAY.
HERE, HONEY.
SHH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HELLO?
WE'RE JUST HERE FOR SOME WARM CLOTHES.
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
THANK YOU!
WAIT!
WAIT!
MY DADDY'S HURT.
WESLEY, COME HERE.
OH, THANK GOD.
I THINK HE CAME THIS WAY.
OH.
I FOUND PEOPLE.
LISTEN TO ME.
DON'T YOU EVER LEAVE ME, OKAY?
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
CAN WE HELP?
YOU OKAY?
I WAS TRYING TO LOAD OUR TRUCK UP
AND THIS WHOLE THING FELL ON ME.
IT'S GOT MY LEG PINNED DOWN HERE.
OKAY, ON THE COUNT OF THREE, GUYS.
YOU READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE...
LET IT GO.
LET IT GO.
I THINK IF YOU LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP,
I CAN PROBABLY SHIMMY OUT.
OKAY, READY?
GOT IT?
OH, YEAH.
YOU GOT IT?
YOU CLEAR?
YEAH.
HERE.
GET UP.
DADDY, YOU'RE BLEEDING.
I'LL BE OKAY, SON.
MAN, THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME ALONG.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WE LOST OUR VAN AT THE RIVER
AND YOUR PLACE WAS THE FIRST PLACE WE CAME UPON.
I HAVE A VEST JUST LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THIS IS YOUR VEST.
WE KIND OF BROKE INTO YOUR PLACE.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE.
RELAX.
LOOK, ANYTHING YOU NEED HERE,
FEEL FREE TO HELP YOURSELF.
BESIDES, THIS PLACE ISN'T EVEN GONNA BE HERE IN A HOUR.
ARE WE GONNA FLY NOW?
NO, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE TRUCK, REMEMBER?
LOOK, YOU GUYS, WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM.
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
WHICH WAY YOU GUYS HEADED?
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HEAD WEST.
YEAH, WE'RE HEADED TO NEW YORK.
NEW YORK?
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE YOU WANT TO GO.
THIS ICEBERG IS CHEWING UP THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEW YORK.
OUR DAUGHTER'S IN NEW YORK.
WELL, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
ME AND WESLEY, WE'RE GOING WEST.
HEY, IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?
MY DADDY CAN FLY.
SO CAN MINE.
DOES THIS STILL WORK?
SURE DOES.
ME AND WESLEY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN JAMAICA BY NOW,
BUT ONLY A FOOL WOULD GO UP IN THIS WEATHER.
GUYS, WE'RE ALL PACKED UP.
WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT.
YOU'RE STILL MORE THAN WELCOME TO JOIN US.
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT I THINK I SHOULD GO
AND I'LL MEET YOU GUYS IN FLORIDA.
I AM NOT LEAVING YOU, EVER.
DAD, DAD, YOU NEED ME TO NAVIGATE.
OKAY.
GOOD LUCK.
YOU, TOO.
NELSON.
OKAY, NELSON, GET THIS OUT OF THE TARP.
LET'S GO.
BE CAREFUL.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE UNTIL THE GLACIER GETS HERE?
YOU HEAR THAT?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
NOT LONG.
LET'S GO.
COME ON!
GO!
THERE IT IS!
JERSEY!
COME ON, JULIA!
COME ON!
WE GOT TO GO!
ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
YOU READY?
ALL RIGHT, DAD!
WE CAN PROBABLY BE IN NEW YORK IN 30 MINUTES.
JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS BUMPY RIDE.
THESE CLOUDS DON'T LOOK NORMAL.
NOTHING LOOKS NORMAL.
IS THAT A TWISTER?
BILL, FLY US OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAN YOU FLY ABOVE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T WE HAVE A WEATHER DETECTION DEVICE?
I DON'T SEE ONE.
BILL, WE'RE FLYING RIGHT INTO THE THICK OF THAT.
HOLD ON!
DAD, YOU GOT TO GET US OUT OF HERE!
FLY HIGHER!
HIGHER, BILL!
HA HA!
AMAZING, DAD.
DAD!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
ARE THEY GONNA GO BOMB THE GLACIER?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
EVERYTHING PROCEEDING PROPERLY, APPROACHING GLACIER.
ROGER THAT.
WE'RE AT THE OBSERVATION LOCATION.
WE'RE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 3-500 FEET
AND SIX MILES FROM LOCATION IMPACT.
WE NEED THE COORDINATES TO PLANT THE EXPLOSIONS.
ROGER THAT.
SENDING THEM NOW.
TEAMS FIVE AND SIX HAVE LANDED,
WAITING FOR SUPPLIES.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE DESCENDING NOW.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
AN HOUR TILL IMPACT.
AFFIRMATIVE?
63 MINUTES, MAJOR.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON, COME ON, GET IT, GO, GO!
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,
HOW LONG UNTIL THE PAYLOAD DROP?
ARRIVING NOW.
ROGER THAT.
COME ON.
WE HAVE TO FIND SHELTER.
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS I'M IN JERSEY.
WE WILL.
COME ON.
CAN WE JUST STOP?
I'M TIRED.
NOT YET.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
COME ON.
HEY!
AAH!
AAH!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT!
HEY, LET HER GO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!
LET HIM GO!
GIVE ME YOUR COAT OR I'M GONNA KILL YOU!
STOP!
STOP!
NATIONAL GUARD!
STOP!
ARE YOU OKAY?
STOP!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING OUT HERE?
THIS CITY'S BEEN EVACUATED!
TO WHERE?
TO SHELTERS.
HELL, YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY I FOUND YOU.
I WAS ON MY LAST SWEEP.
LET'S GO!
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GLACIER?
ISN'T IT HEADED RIGHT FOR US?
NOT FOR LONG.
THERE'S A COMBINED TASKFORCE ON ITS WAY TO MEET IT.
SO YOU'VE DECLARED WAR ON A GLACIER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE LAST CHUNK OF THE GLACIER,
AND THEY'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ON IT.
NOW GET YOUR ASSES INSIDE BEFORE I HAVE YOU ARRESTED!
GO!
GO!
THAT'S THE LAST OF THE EXPLOSIVES, MAJOR.
GOOD, GOOD!
ALL EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED.
ROGER THAT.
THE CHARGES ARE IN PLACE!
TAKE US BACK HOME!
COPY THAT.
PREPARE FOR EXTRACTION.
ROGER THAT.
HEY, NELSON.
GRAB THE COMPUTER.
I WANT TO FIND OUT
IF WE CAN CONNECT TO A SATELLITE AT THIS ALTITUDE.
GOT IT.
SHOULD TAKE A SEC.
RECEPTION BLOWS UP HERE.
I GOT A SIGNAL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO CONNECT UP TO THE NOAA WEBSITE.
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT GLACIER IS RIGHT NOW.
GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE LOGIN?
LOGIN IS USERNAME JULIA,
PASSWORD, NELSON.
DAD, THAT'S LAME.
THAT IS SWEET.
LAME OR NOT, OPEN UP THE TRACKING PROGRAM.
NOW RUN THE SIMULATION WITH THE SAME COORDINATES,
BUT PUT IN OUR GPS LOCATION RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW FAR AWAY WE ARE FROM THAT GLACIER.
OKAY, IT'S 50 MILES BEHIND US.
IT'S MOVING AT 200 MILES AN HOUR.
WHAT?
HOW CAN A GLACIER MOVE AT 200 MILES PER HOUR?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE DOES EITHER.
CAN WE OUTRUN THAT?
ARE WE GONNA MAKE IT ON TIME?
LET'S FIND OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WE'RE ICING UP.
DOESN'T THIS MODEL HAVE DE-ICERS?
NO.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FLY LOW IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
WE'RE BURNING FUEL LIKE CRAZY.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK OUTSIDE
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY KIND OF PRIVATE AIRFIELD,
A CROP DUSTING OPERATION, ANYTHING.
YOU GUYS FINDING ANYTHING?
HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM NEW YORK?
CAN'T BE MORE THAN 100 MILES.
YOU GUYS SEEING ANYTHING?
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
THIS VISIBILITY SUCKS BALLS.
NELSON!
OKAY, GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE GONNA GO LOWER.
ANYTHING?
NOPE, NOTHING.
WE'RE STILL COLLECTING A LOT OF ICE.
I MAY HAVE TO PUT HER DOWN AT ANY TIME, GUYS.
HOW MUCH MORE ICE CAN THIS THING TAKE?
NOT A LOT.
THESE HEADWINDS ARE KILLING US.
WE COULD WALK THERE FASTER.
HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT?
ABOUT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.
I'M GONNA TRY TO LAND HER AT NEWARK OR LA GUARDIA.
WILL THEY ALLOW US TO LAND WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN?
WELL, I'LL JUST RADIO AHEAD
AND TELL THEM WE'RE AN EMERGENCY.
THEY HAVE TO LET US LAND.
WHAT IF THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HEAR US?
OH, CRAP!
WHAT?
WE JUST RAN OUT OF FUEL IN THE RIGHT FUEL TANK!
OKAY, GUYS, STRAP YOURSELVES IN.
GET READY.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING.
REALLY, BILL?
YES!
GET READY!
GOD, LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
WELL, AT LEAST WE GET FREE COOKIES.
YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND US?
I HOPE SO.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?
DAD'S IN NORTHERN EUROPE NEAR OSLO.
IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST HIT.
IT'S OKAY.
I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU.
OKAY, YOU GUYS.
WE GOT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING ANOTHER PLACE TO LAND,
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO NEWARK.
WE'RE ENTERING INTO THE NEW YORK AIR CORRIDOR NOW.
I'M GONNA GET ON THE RADIO
AND SEE IF ANYBODY'S THERE LISTENING.
GIVE ME THE RADIO THERE, NELSON.
NEWARK TOWER, THIS IS CESSNA...
WHERE'S THE FLIGHT NUMBER?
GIVE ME THE FLIGHT NUMBER.
THIS IS CESSNA NUMBER NOVEMBER NINER, NINER, 7-2-5.
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
DO YOU COPY?
CAN THEY EVEN HEAR US?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND A HOLE AND SLIP INTO IT.
BUCKLE UP, GUYS.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE GROUND
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, SO HOLD ON.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO LOOK AROUND
TO SEE IF YOU CAN SEE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT
THAT MIGHT BE LANDING WITHOUT TOWER PERMISSION, OKAY?
BRACE YOURSELVES!
TWO O'CLOCK!
LOOK!
YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH?
OKAY.
WE'RE DOWN.
OKAY, OKAY.
LET'S GET OUT, GUYS.
COME ON.
COME ON OUT.
COME ON, GUYS.
HERE WE GO.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
WELL, I GUESS WE GOT OUT JUST IN TIME.
HEY, GUYS, LOOK.
IT'S NEW YORK.
WE DID IT!
ALMOST THERE.
YEAH.
DID YOU CRASH THAT ONE EIGHTY?
YEAH.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I GOT ALL THE INSURANCE INFORMATION IF YOU NEED IT.
IF A CRASHED CESSNA WAS ALL WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT,
I'D CALL IT A GOOD DAY.
COME WITH ME.
LET'S GET YOU INTO SOMEPLACE SAFE.
COLONEL SINOR, THIS IS COMMAND.
WE ARE LESS THAN 30 SECONDS FROM DETONATION.
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE ALL CLEAR AND STANDING BY.
GIVE ME A LONG COUNT, CAPTAIN.
FIRE!
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
WERE YOU GUYS HEADED INTO MANHATTAN?
YEAH, BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR DAUGHTER.
I'M SORRY.
NO ONE'S GETTING IN AND OUT OF NEW YORK ALIVE.
JUST STAY HERE.
THE NATIONAL GUARD'S GONNA BE HERE TO GET YOU.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT--
OH!
OH!
COME ON, GET BACK!
GET BACK!
WE JUST GOT TO STAY AWAY FROM TALL BUILDINGS
WITH LOTS OF GLASS, GOT IT?
DAD, WE'RE GOING TO MANHATTAN.
POINT TAKEN.
SO HOW WE GONNA GET THERE?
WE GOT TO GET OURSELVES ANOTHER CAR
AND THEN JUST DRIVE INTO THE CITY.
AND GO WHERE?
TO THE DORM.
THE DORM?
SHE'S NOT AT THE DORM AND YOU KNOW THAT.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE SHE GOT OUR MESSAGE.
WHAT, TO GO TO FLORIDA?
LOOK, SHE MAY NOT BE IN NEW YORK,
BUT WE HAVE START THERE.
FROM THERE, MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
SOME SORT OF CLUE WHERE SHE--
ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE?
HEY, GUYS!
ARE WE GOING OR WHAT?
WERE THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.
LET'S JUST GO.
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET HOLD OF HER AGAIN.
IF WE'RE IN JERSEY, HOW FAR IS NEW YORK?
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER.
WE'RE COMING UP TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.
NO SIGNAL.
IT JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY NOW.
IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH.
WE JUST NEED TO GET UNDER THE GW.
I'LL TRY TO GET THE GPS RUNNING.
IS EVERYONE TRYING TO GET TO NEW YORK?
LOOK AT THAT MESS.
NELSON, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO THE BRIDGE.
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN YOUR CAR AROUND.
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH HERE.
WE HAVE TO GET TO MANHATTAN.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE'S GOING OVER THERE.
NO, OUR DAUGHTER IS THERE, AND WE NEED TO PICK HER UP.
I DON'T CARE IF THE POPE'S OVER THERE.
NO ONE'S GOING IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER SOON ANYWAY.
PLEASE JUST LET US GO.
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.
WASHINGTON BRIDGE, IT'S OUT.
WOW!
THE AIR FORCE IS COMING IN FOR THEIR LAST AIR STRIKE.
LET'S HOPE THAT DOES IT,
OR MAYBE NONE OF US WILL GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW, BILL?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE THINKING SOMETHING.
WHAT?
OH, IT'S JUST THAT
REMEMBER WHEN THE KIDS WERE REALLY, REALLY YOUNG
AND WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE COULD PUT
SOME SORT OF TRACKING DEVICE ON THEM,
WE'D ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE INVENTED THAT DEVICE.
DAMN IT!
WAIT, WAIT, GUYS!
WE DO HAVE A TRACKING DEVICE!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, NELSON?
OH, OF COURSE!
OF COURSE WHAT?
EVEN IF WE CAN'T TALK TO HER ON HER PHONE,
WE CAN TRACK HER PHONE.
REALLY?
WE CAN DO THAT?
YES.
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?
DON'T ASK.
I GOT IT!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
NEW JERSEY?
SHE'S HERE!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!
OH, MY GOD, BILL.
WHERE?
UM...
FOUR MILES THAT WAY.
TWO MORE MILES.
HURRY, BILL!
OKAY, PEOPLE, THIS IS IT!
STAY BACK.
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!
JUDGMENT--
HOW FAR ARE WE?
1.7 MILES.
WHICH WAY DO WE GO?
THERE'S GONNA BE A DEAD END ON YOUR LEFT,
SO WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT.
OKAY, GUYS, HERE WE GO.
HOLD ON A SECOND!
T MINUS 2 MINUTES FOR LAUNCH.
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE NOT GETTING THROUGH THIS.
HOW FAR AWAY IS SHE?
DAD, SHE'S JUST TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
OKAY, WE'RE GOING ON FOOT, GUYS.
COME ON.
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S THE GPS SAY?
SHE'S THAT WAY!
ONE MORE BLOCK THIS WAY!
JUST OVER A BLOCK!
OH!
DAD, MY PHONE!
GOT TO GET MY PHONE TO FIND HER!
NELSON, LISTEN TO ME.
WE'LL FIND HER.
FORGET IT, FORGET IT!
WE DON'T HAVE TIME!
LET'S GO.
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!
JULIA!

THAT'S MY DAD.
JULIA!
DAD!
DAD!
JULIA!
DADDY!
I GOT HER!
LET'S GO!
DADDY!
OH, JULIA, ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M FINE.
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, MY GOD.
OH, THANK GOD.
OH, BABY.
HI, BABY.
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
WE GOT HER.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET ME SEE YOU.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
DAD, THIS IS LOGAN.
HI, LOGAN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GET TO SAFETY, GUYS.
COME ON.
DAD, DRIVE!
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!
THE BRIDGES ARE DOWN, STREETS ARE BLOCKED, THE RIVER'S FROZEN.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
DADDY?
ARE YOU DRIVING ON THE HUDSON RIVER?
IS IT GONNA HOLD?
IT DIDN'T LAST TIME.
LAST TIME?
WHAT?
YOU SEE THAT?
THOSE ARE F-16s GOING IN!
WHAT WAS THAT?
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING BIG JUST BLEW UP.
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE CANNOT KEEP GOING ON LIKE THIS!
I KNOW!
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY OFF THE RIVER!
ANY IDEAS?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
OKAY, IF WE CAN MAKE IT.
GLACIER APPEARS TO BE BREAKING UP.
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT!
LET'S GO!
OKAY, GO ON THROUGH!
COME ON THROUGH!
LET'S GO!
NO, NO, NO, FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS!
KEEP GOING!
HURRY!
OKAY, GET DOWN.
GET DOWN.
HONEY.
HEAR ANYTHING?
NO.
IS IT DONE?
HOLD ON.
COME ON.
COME ON UP.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
OH.
Blue team to base camp.
Go, blue team.
Are you getting this?
The seismic activity seems to be increasing exponentially.
I'm heading north on the shelf to collect more data.
Copy.
Blue team, reports show... the Hekla volcano is having immense seismic readings.
Proceed with caution.
Copy that.
Base camp, we're seeing intense magna flow... running up and down the range.
If it keeps increasing, we may have to evacuate the area now.
All the local areas.
Base camp, if the whole range starts erupting,
We're looking at a whole glacier detaching from the shelf.
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Can I really talk to base on this thing?
Oh, absolutely.
I talk to them all the time.
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Try a lower band.
There you go.
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp.
Do you read?
Just can't get it.
There's too much interference.
I'm going to take down a plane with this thing.
Better not.
Hey, did you pack your gortex?
Hello?
Julia?
Julia?
Unbelievable.
You heard me a second ago.
Mom packed it.
Well, good, I'm glad.
You know, it gets cold in New York, Julia.
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
This is 6SNL7 to summit camp.
Do you read?
Summit camp, come in.
Dad, I think i just got 'em.
Oh, great.
6SNL7, come in.
Dad, I'm gonna miss my flight!
Hold on.
Dad, this is my terminal.
Dad!
6SNL7, come in.
This is summit camp.
Go ahead.
Divya?
Hey, I wanted to let you know... that I'm bringing some new instruments next week.
Bill, have you looked at the data we sent?
No, no, no.
I'm not in the office.
I'm dropping Julia off at the airport.
- Why?
What's up?
- We're evacuating.
The rest of the team is gone already.
I'm the last man standing.
Evacuating?
Why?
Dad, I should just walk from here.
Hekla went berserk.
There's a huge pressure buildup.
The endurance readings are off the chart.
The entire Hekla line is erupting.
There is pressure building up everywhere.
Bill, I've never seen anything like this.
Pressure building up where?
At what site?
I'm trying.
Guys, hold on.
We're seeing activity across the entire range.
Wait, at all the sites?
That doesn't make any sense, Divya.
I checked with the other stations.
No one's ever seen anything like this.
I sent you everything we got
Before the centers melted down, Bill.
Look at the data!
No, I'm not at the office.
I'll be there in an hour.
Pull up the computer simulation.
Divya, can you read me?
Divya?
Okay, I'm going back to school now.
No need to say goodbye or anything.
Reykjanes ridge?
Yeah.
Divya, are you there?
Magna flow rate?
F7.
Divya, can you read me?
Right, I'll be back around christmastime
Unless I decide to stay in New York forever.
Divya, come in.
Divya, if you can still hear me,
I will look at the data... and I will contact you... as soon as I get to the office.
Divya, are you there?
6SNL7, come in.
5-3-7-6-E-9.
6SNL7, do you copy?
Sir, you're going to need to move your car.
It's fine.
I'm just dropping my daughter off.
We'll be two minutes.
6SNL7, do you read?
Sir?
Oh, my god.
Come in, 6SNL7.
Do you read?
Sir, you're gonna have to move your car.
Sir?
Hart, do you read me?
Yes, go ahead, Divya.
I read you.
Go ahead.
I can't believe what's happening!
The entire range is on fire!
Sir, this is a no parking zone.
This is loading and unloading only.
I need you to move your...
This is massive!
What's happening?
The entire range is on fire!
Every single volcano is erupting!
Say again.
I couldn't understand.
The entire ice shelf is fracturing!
It's 1,000 miles long!
Bill, do you read me?
Something about the volcano.
Is not moving.
Dad, we need to go.
Look.
Yeah.
Where's Julia?
She left, like, two minutes ago.
What?
Ah, crap.
You want me to drive, dad?
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just can't believe I missed her.
I can't believe I didn't say goodbye to your sister.
Mom's gonna kill you.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Dad, what is Dr. Chandra saying about the glacier?
Did it calf?
Well, it's possible,
But it sounded a lot bigger than that.
That would be sick.
Sick, huh?
100%.
Why don't you bring up the simulation again... on the parameter screen, okay?
Okay, let's see.
Okay, using these numbers,
See what you can come up with... for the ice flow projection, okay?
I'll be right back.
Roy?
Bill?
What're you doing here?
I thought you were out in the field.
I just spoke with Divya,
And he had sent you some data.
Did you receive it?
Yeah, the Hekla volcano just erupted.
No, but it sounded more than the Hekla, like the whole range went up.
We know.
Hart, go home.
We've got this.
I could be pulling maps or crunching numbers.
Why are you trying to send me home?
Bill, we don't need you.
Roy, look, we've been friends for 15 years.
What the hell's going on here?
Bill, I have just put Cynthia and my kids... on a plane to Mexico.
You do the same.
We have got chunks of ice... falling all over Canada.
In 19 hours, the bulk of the glacier... is going to hit North America.
Bill, get your family out now.
What did you get?
It won't let me input this data.
Okay.
Well, let's open up a terminal window... and we'll enter sandbox mode.
What's that?
Well, it's a mode that allows you... to enter in variables that are theoretically impossible.
What does that mean?
It means we gotta get your mom.
Why?
Right now.
I'll tell you on the way.
Hold on.
Excuse me, senator.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
But I just got off the phone with Cyrus... over Atmair traffic services, and he said that all the flights are grounded... because of the volcanic ash flow.
Get Quincy in DC and ask him... if they're gonna postpone the summit.
Yes, senator.
Hey.
Your daughter's flying out today.
Yes.
Starting college.
NYU.
Teri, these volcanoes are in Greenland.
Julia's flying into New York.
She'll be fine.
I hope so.
I'm sure you're right, sir.
Thank you.
Teri?
Teri?
Teri?
Bill, what are you doing here?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to Julia?
You have to come with us right now.
Did something happen to Julia?
No, no.
Julia is fine.
Everything's fine.
Okay, thank you.
Please don't scare me like that.
What are you doing here?
I was talking to Divya about the Petermann glacier.
Divya?
Petermann?
What is that?
Hi, Bill.
Hi, senator.
Is everything all right with Julia?
Everything's fine with Julia, senator.
Sorry to disturb you.
But you need to leave town right now, sir.
Bill!
Bill was just leaving, senator.
So sorry to disturb you.
Look, there is a huge glacier coming our way,
And it's coming at us really, really quick.
We gotta get outta town!
Listen, I have a summit meeting.
No, no, no.
I understand.
Mom, mom!
This is true!
We have to get out of Maine.
Really?
You're gonna bring our son into all your weather...
It's true!
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.
Hi, Josh.
Hi.
Hey, Bill.
I can't seem to get anybody... on the phone about the summit.
Not even the white house is picking up.
You'd better be right about this.
Josh, go home.
What?
No, don't go home.
Get out of Maine.
Go as far south as you can!
What's going on?
Don't scare him like that!

Foxtrot, whiskey, 8-7-0 clear to take off.
Roger, I'm getting a visual now.
This is Foxtrot, Whiskey, 8-7-0.
It's heading towards Newfoundland.
Why is it getting darker?
The weather's changing.
Dad, are your headlights on?
Give me your phone.
I need to call Julia.
Can we go home first?
I need to get my laptop.
We have to get out of town.
She's not picking up.
I don't understand this.
Don't they have Wi-Fi on airplanes?
Maybe if she was flying first class.
She shouldn't have even been flying at all today.
Not today.
Don't worry.
She's gonna be landing soon.
We'll get hold of her.
It'll be okay.
Whoa.
Use words, Nelson.
I don't think I can.
What?
Well, we're not going back home.
Why not?
Don't have enough time.
Look at the clouds.
What can do that?
Glaciers.
Really, really fast glaciers.
Okay, so where we going?
New York.
Take us about 7, 8 hours.
Hey.
Hey!
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Sorry it took me so long.
Traffic was a mess.
I know.
They grounded all the flights.
They did?
- Damn.
- Mm-Hmm.
Guess we're gonna be here a while, huh?
Well, that's not such a bad thing.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
Oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
Who's that?
No one.
Let's go back to the dorm and fool around.
All right.
Sounds good to me.
Julia, we're on our way to New York.
We're gonna meet you at your dorm, okay, honey?
So when you get to the dorm, just stay there, all right?
We're gonna meet you there.
All right, big hugs, and love you.
Love you, love you, love you.
Bye.
Are you sure that New York is safe?
Bill?
How stupid.
Why don't we just have her fly and meet us down in Florida?
Sweetheart, everything is grounded.
I say we stay on plan... and we just meet her at the dorm.
Fine.
Oh, my gosh!
It's okay, it's okay.
We're okay.
Dad, I think it's coming faster than we thought!
Have you ever seen this?
No.
The glaciers are making it snow in Maine?
It's summer.
Can you just get us out of Maine now?
How big do these glaciers have to be to do this?
Bill?
Crap.
Dad, does this snow mean the glacier's getting close?
Bill, it has to because the clouds are looking massive.
I bet this glacier is enormous,
Like the whole shelf.
Yeah.
Okay, here's what we got to do.
I got to find a way around this traffic.
Nelson, jump on the GPS and find me an alternate route.
On it.
Bill, get us out of here now!
We don't know if the glacier is close.
Those military planes?
F-16s.
Nelson, focus.
GPS.
Target is 400 miles off the Northeast coast... and is now in range.
Sir, I don't see anything.
Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you.
Negative, Alpha Foxtrot.
I see nothing.
Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you.
Negative, Alpha Foxtrot.
There is nothing.
Delta Bravo One, look again.
Holy sh...
Pull up!
Pull up!
Pull up!
Delta Bravo One, do you read me?
Delta Bravo One?
Alpha Foxtrot, this is control.
Fire sequence in 3... 2... 1... fire!
Oh, my god!
Dad, get us out of here!
Is everybody okay?
Is it gone?
I don't know.
I don't see anything.
I think we outran it.
What do you think, Bill?
Do you think it's gone?
I just don't know.
Maybe we should just pull over.
No, not yet, not yet.
Everything is gone, isn't it?
Just don't even think about it, all right, Nelson?
Everything.
God, my friends.
I need to get online!
No, no.
You need to focus on what's important, okay?
This is important!
No, this is not important!
Mom, your cell phone.
It's Julia.
Julia?
Julia!
Mom!
Oh, my god.
Is everyone okay?
We're fine.
We're fine.
Dad's here and Nelson's here.
What happened?
We don't know.
The news is saying that Bangor just got destroyed.
Tell her we're coming to New York.
We're coming to New York.
Mom, can I just talk to her?
Tell her that we'll be at her dorm... in six hours from now.
We're gonna be at your dorm in six hours, okay?
Can you hear me?
Julia?
Julia?
Hello?
Let me talk to her.
Julia, listen.
If the weather breaks, head south to Florida... to your aunt Kissy's house.
The further south you go, the safer it is.
Julia?
Hello?
Julia?
Hello?
Sweetheart, if you can...
Mom?
Lost it.
Dad, I wanted to talk to her.
Sorry, buddy.
Well, what?
My parents are coming for me.
I think they want us to stay at the dorm.
Well, we should get going then.
Yeah.
It's getting cold fast.
Come on!
Evacuation is mandatory... in most Northeast coastal towns.
We've been informed, following an onsite evaluation, the president will hold a press conference... with the most current update.
The military currently has Awac in the air... assessing the threat.
Dropping out at 400.
Target is breaking up, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference.
Say again, Johnny Bravo.
Target is separating into multiple sections... and there's still a lot... heading south down the coast.
Wow.
Cloud cover's just so thick, it looks like night.
I'm getting nothing.
I'm trying to call her back.
Look, she's gonna be okay, okay?
We're gonna be okay.
We're all gonna be okay.
Can't get hold of the senator.
Can't get hold of anybody.
Dad, you said the Petermann glacier was how big?
Let's see, the last calving happened in 2010.
That was about 100 square miles,
Which is roughly four times the size of Manhattan,
And that was only 8% of the glacier.
This sounds like it's the whole glacier.
With enough speed, who knows how much damage it could do?
What?
Dad!
Which way's your room?
This way.
Come on.
Karen!
Oh, my god, Julia.
I can't get hold of anyone in Maine.
Just try again, okay?
It took me three tries.
Keep trying.
Right, right.
Keep trying.
Is there a basement?
No, there'd be no reception in the basement.
I'm gonna keep trying.
Come on, Julia!
No, that's a mistake.
No, Julia, we have to go!
What was that?
I don't know.
Hurry!
Put your jacket on.
We gotta go.
But my dad said to stay here.
I know.
Call him and tell him,
But we aren't staying here, Julia!
Mom!
Dad!
We're not staying here.
The dorms aren't safe!
I'll give you a call when we...
I lost the signal.
You think the message went through?
I hope so.
So then what now?
How do we get outta the city?
Everything's shut down.
We get to one of the bridges and get across the river!
Wait, wait, wait!
Julia, what about the subway?
The subways are shut down, too.
I'm not talking about the train, Julia.
I'm talking about the tunnels.
We can make it through one of those.
You really think that'll work?
Would you rather stay up here?
Come on!
Oh... oh.
You okay?
I'm okay, dad.
Yeah, yeah.
We're okay.
We'll work our way out.
Come on.
Nelson's okay.
We're good.
The sun is breaking through.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
You okay?
You all right?
You're bleeding.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's just a cut.
Come on.
Get Nelson.
Come on, sweetie.
Nelson?
You okay?
Baby, you all right?
Okay.
Broken bones?
No.
Anything?
Okay.
All right, guys, okay.
Good job.
I love you so much.
It's gonna be all right.
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, dad.
- Good job.
Okay, let's get moving.
Let's go.
We got to get away from the car.
Keep going.
Come on.
We need to find another car.
See if that van works.
Okay, guys, come on.
Come on.
So cold.
There's no one here.
Okay, guys, get in.
Get in, honey.
Look for some keys.
I'm gonna check this out.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
Where's dad going?
I don't know.
He'll be back.
Give me your hands.
Hello?
Hello?
Where's dad?
I don't know.
He'll be back, though, honey.
Mom, the keys are in the ignition.
Oh, good.
Let's start it.
Come on.
Try again.
Yes!
Okay, good.
It's a mess in here.
Smells like shit.
Oh, good.
You got it running.
Yeah.
Okay, bad news.
There's a big pileup.
We gotta find a way...
What's that smell?
I think it's manure or something.
It smells awful.
Manure?
Like fertilizer?
Yeah.
What kind?
I don't know.
What're you doing, honey?
Just a little science project.
Excellent.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Where'd he go?
What was that?
I don't know.
I hope dad comes back soon.
Okay, inside.
Go.
Okay, heads down.
Heads down.
Here we go.
Heads down.
Okay, why?
Just a little science experiment.
What kinda science experiment, Bill?
The kind that goes boom.
See, when you take ammonium nitrate... and you had a little bit of diesel fuel, you get...
Whoa!
Dad, where'd you learn to do that?
In science class.
Oh, god, Bill.
I have phone reception, I think.
I do.
I have phone reception.
Pull over.
Pull over right now!
Mom got a reception?
Yeah.
Well?
Mom, dad, it's Julia.
It's Julia.
Where we going to go?
Mom, dad, we're not staying here.
Nelson, get on the shortwave.
The dorms aren't safe.
I'll give you a call...
Something bad has hit her dorm.
What happened?
I don't know.
I'm playing it again.
Mom, dad, it's Julia.
We're not safe...
Something's hit the dorm really bad and she's trying to get out.
We're not staying here.
The dorms aren't safe.
She's saying she cannot get out of New York city.
What the heck was that?
It's a sonic boom.
10 birds in formation.
They're gonna go bomb the glacier.
Can they do that?
Can they bomb a glacier, Bill?
Yeah, they could do that, but they'd need to hit it with a nuclear bomb... to stop this thing.
That's what they're doing.
They said Boston's gonna be hit next...
If they don't stop it.
Boston?
We have gotta get to New York City right now.
We gotta get out of here.
Oscar Charlie and Delta X-Ray approaching target.
Roger, Oscar Charlie.
Ordering nuclear payload active.
Nukes are hot, waiting for countdown.
My son was born in Boston, so let's melt this ice.
Roger that.
Fire one!
Oscar Charlie, do you have a visual?
Checking now.
Command 483.
Nukes deployed, but they have no visual effect.
Waiting on next command.
Everyone looks so scared.
Why are we stopping?
Look, we got this big empty van, all these people need help.
I figure, you know, we'll open up a door...
Our daughter's in New York.
We need to get her, and she is our priority.
She's our top priority, and we're on our way to New York.
I figure we can have a couple people... ride with us to New York.
It'll take two minutes...
No!
Two minutes?
Yeah, two minutes.
Honey, we just can't leave people out there.
Honey?
Mom, dad... hear that?
Everybody okay?
I don't hear anything.
I think we made it.
Let's keep going.
What happened?
Boston's been hit!
The glacier's less than an hour from us!
It's headed right for us!
It's too late.
We have to tell my parents not to come.
All the circuits are busy.
No surprise there.
Keep it on.
We'll try again later.
We got to keep moving.
Come on.
Babe, I know where we are.
We could take a tunnel.
We tried them all.
They're closed!
Trust me!
Go, go.
Hurry.
Hurry!
Be careful.
Careful.
We used to go this way when we were, like, 12.
Just need to find a light.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
We really have to go down there?
Yeah.
It's safer than up there.
Oh, god.
What if my parents try to make it to New York?
They're going to get your message.
Yeah, but what if...
They'll get the message.
Hey, guys, we're gonna need to find some gas soon.
I can log on and find us a gas station.
I don't think that's gonna happen, honey.
Power grid is down, buddy.
That means no Wi-Fi, no gas stations.
I'm really hungry.
We just need to find him some food... and let's find some gas.
All right?
Let's just start looking for something.
Dad, look!
You can siphon gas.
Great idea.
Okay, guys, let's start looking for cars,
Hopefully filled with food.
Hang in there, Nelson.
We're almost in New York, okay?
Slow down, slow down, Bill.
I think I see some cars in the distance.
It's just so creepy... when it gets dark in the middle of the day.
Honey, just get what we need and get back.
Be careful.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if anyone's in there.
Just stay there.
Why?
Just stay there.
All right.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
I can do this.
I got this.
All right.
I'm gonna go pee.
Okay.
I'm glad that was you and not me.
Yeah, me, too.
It's working.
That is some strong stuff.
Whew!
Hey, we're in Connecticut.
Honey?
I'm not stopping.
It's pitch black.
Hey, Nelson, have you been able... to pull up anything on the GPS?
Not really.
Are you kidding me?
What?
Hand 'em over.
Unbelievable.
You got anything else back there, chef Nelson?
Oh, man!
I was gonna tell you guys.
Yeah, sure you were.
Dinner?
Thanks.
Thank you, honey.
Nelson, how much longer to New York?
About two hours.
You think she's still at the dorm?
I'm sure your sister's fine.
She's a smart girl and she can take care of herself.
It's this way.
You sure we're going the right way?
I mean, you haven't been down here in 10 years.
You have to calm down and trust me, okay?
It's the only way, Julia.
It feels like we're going deeper, though.
What was that?
Oh, god, I don't know.
Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good.
Come on.
Wow.
It sounds like it's getting worse.
Come on.
Let's keep moving.
Dad, I got a frequency.
Go Henry. 11-41 and 44th and... intersection.
10-4...
LB.
AJ4-LB.
Turn to channel 3 for further details.
Copy that.
Thank you.
You okay?
Do you want me to drive?
You know, i didn't say goodbye.
She got out of the car
And I didn't even know it.
We're almost to New York,
And you're gonna get to see her again.
We're gonna get to see her again, okay?
Oh, crap.
Stay here.
Are we in New York?
Not yet, honey.
Not yet.
Hey!
Hey!
Is your car working?
No, it's out of gas.
Oh, gas, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But you're cool with that, right?
I mean, you're stuck, but you're okay, right?
Yeah, yeah, we'll figure it out.
Right.
Are you okay?
Why do you say that?
No reason.
Hey, hey!
Are you alone?
Hey, are you alone?
'Cause I'm alone.
I'm here with my family.
Oh, that's cool, that's cool.
Hey, you know, it's really cold out here, right?
I mean, I should probably get someplace warm.
Yeah, I'd say find yourself a car and stay inside.
Yeah, yeah, no, no.
I'll get a car.
I'll go to California.
You know, hey, I'll go to the beach... and the pretty blonde women.
Maybe have tequilas on the beach.
That sounds like a good plan.
Nice meeting you.
No, no, hey, hey, hey!
I'm thinking that, you know,
You and I could go to California together.
No, we're going to New York.
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, yeah.
But, you know, New York's really cold, and, you know, we need to go someplace that's warm.
Look, I'm not gonna go anywhere with you, okay?
You got that?
Except you're not gonna leave me.
Again, you go.
We need to go to California.
Just calm down.
I got my family right there.
Just calm down.
Look at me!
We're going to California.
I got some money.
That can help.
I don't want your money.
I got some food if you want some food.
I don't want your food.
Hey, what kind of food you got?
I need to get into the van.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, no, yeah.
No, go, go, go.
Get in.
Nelson, give me a bag of chips.
Bill?
Bill, hey, hey.
Your name is Bill.
Bill, hey, I'm Gary.
I'm gary Morganson.
Hey, Gary.
Yeah, hey.
You know, I'm thinking maybe...
I need to get in the car.
No, we're going to New York, remember?
Here's your food.
No, no, no.
I'm thinking that
I should get in the car with you guys.
No, no, no.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Bill, come on.
I'm not a bad guy.
I hear you.
No, no, I'm a good guy.
I'm a great guy.
I just wanna go someplace warm, you know?
I mean...
Hey, hey, kid, kid, kid, kid!
Lock the doors, Nelson, lock the doors!
Dad, do something!
Bill, get us out of here now!
I can't we're blocked in.
My sister's in New York!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Lock the doors, Nelson.
Lock the doors!
You guys think I'm kidding?
Calm down, man.
Think I'm joking around?
You're dead.
You're dead!
Your whole frigging family is dead!
All of you are frigging dead!
You're dead!
Open the door, kid.
Everybody out.
Come on.
Come on, Teri, out.
Get out, Nelson.
Get out.
Go with your dad.
What're we supposed to do?
Follow your dad, Nelson.
Nelson, over here.
He has the radio gear!
Nelson, don't do it!
No!
No, Nelson!
Nelson, come back!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson!
Nelson, what the hell were you doing?
I got it!
I got it!
Don't ever do that again!
Please.
Oh, god!
No!
No!
No!
No!
The ice!
Let's run!
Watch out!
Come on, guys.
We're almost there.
We did it.
It's snowing again.
Okay, let's get another vehicle.
Let's try this way.
Come on.
Where are we?
It's the Lincoln tunnel.
We can take this all the way to New Jersey.
And how far is that?
It's about a mile.
Come on.
Come on.
Dad, I don't think I can keep going.
Got to keep moving.
If we stop, we die.
Let's just go.
Honey, is that a house?
Sure looks like it.
Come on.
Can we go?
Yep, let's try it.
Come on.
It's so cold.
All right, I know, guys.
It's so cold.
Hello!
Hello!
Come on in, guys.
Sit down.
Get warm.
Hello?
I didn't see a car out front.
Looks like they left here pretty quickly.
Here.
Why don't you go see if you find some clothes,
See if you can find some food,
And be quick about it because we gotta get out of here.
Hello?
Hello?
Don't worry, baby.
We haven't forgotten about you.
We haven't forgotten you, Julia.
Here, honey, I found these upstairs.
Oh, great.
Here you go.
Should we just let him sleep?
No, no, no.
We gotta get going.
It may look like night, but it's only 3:00 pm.
Come on, wake up, Nelson.
It's time to go.
We don't have a car.
We don't have a car.
We gotta do it on foot.
Get going and maybe we can find one on the way.
Here, honey.
Shh.
What was that?
Hello?
We're just here for some warm clothes.
We're leaving now.
Thank you!
Wait!
Wait!
My daddy's hurt.
Wesley, come here.
Oh, thank god.
I think he came this way.
Oh.
I found people.
Listen to me.
Don't you ever leave me, okay?
Hey, are you all right?
Can we help?
You okay?
I was trying to load our truck up
And this whole thing fell on me.
It's got my leg pinned down here.
Okay, on the count of three, guys.
You ready?
One, two, three... let it go.
Let it go.
I think if you lift it straight up,
I can probably shimmy out.
Okay, ready?
Got it?
Oh, yeah.
You got it?
You clear?
Yeah.
Here.
Get up.
Daddy, you're bleeding.
I'll be okay, son.
Man, thank god you guys came along.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
We lost our van at the river... and your place was the first place we came upon.
I have a vest just like that.
Oh, yeah.
Actually, this is your vest.
We kind of broke into your place.
We didn't know anyone was here.
Relax.
Look, anything you need here,
Feel free to help yourself.
Besides, this place isn't even gonna be here in a hour.
Are we gonna fly now?
No, we're gonna take the truck, remember?
Look, you guys, we have plenty of room.
You're more than welcome to join us.
Which way you guys headed?
You know, we're gonna head west.
Yeah, we're headed to New York.
New York?
That's the last place you wanna go.
This iceberg is chewing up the entire east coast.
In a couple of hours, there's not gonna be a New York.
Our daughter's in New York.
Well, you do what you gotta do.
Me and Wesley, we're going west.
Hey, is this what I think it is?
My daddy can fly.
So can mine.
Does this still work?
Sure does.
Me and wesley would probably be in jamaica by now,
But only a fool would go up in this weather.
Guys, we're all packed up.
We're gonna head out.
You're still more than welcome to join us.
I know we talked about this, but I think I should go
And I'll meet you guys in Florida.
I am not leaving you, ever.
Dad, dad, you need me to navigate.
Okay.
Good luck.
You, too.
Nelson.
Okay, Nelson, get this out of the tarp.
Let's go.
Be careful.
How long do you think we have until the glacier gets here?
You hear that?
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Not long.
Let's go.
Come on!
Go!
There it is!
Jersey!
Come on, Julia!
Come on!
We got to go!
Are we gonna be able to take off in this kind of weather?
Yeah, no problem.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?
All right, dad!
We can probably be in New York in 30 minutes.
Just sit back and enjoy this bumpy ride.
These clouds don't look normal.
Nothing looks normal.
Is that a twister?
Bill, fly us out of here.
What's wrong?
Can you fly above it?
I don't know.
Don't we have a weather detection device?
I don't see one.
Bill, we're flying right into the thick of that.
Hold on!
Dad, you got to get us out of here!
Fly higher!
Higher, Bill!
Ha ha!
Amazing, dad.
Dad!
Two o'clock!
Look!
Are they gonna go bomb the glacier?
I have no idea.
Everything proceeding properly, approaching glacier.
Roger that.
We're at the observation location.
We're at an altitude of 3-500 feet
And six miles from location impact.
We need the coordinates to plant the explosions.
Roger that.
Sending them now.
Teams five and six have landed, waiting for supplies.
Roger that.
We are descending now.
Lieutenant colonel Sinor, an hour till impact.
Affirmative?
63 minutes, major.
Roger that.
Come on, come on, get it, go, go!
Lieutenant colonel Sinor, how long until the payload drop?
Arriving now.
Roger that.
Come on.
We have to find shelter.
I have to tell my parents I'm in jersey.
We will.
Come on.
Can we just stop?
I'm tired.
Not yet.
We have to keep going.
Come on.
Hey!
Aah!
Aah!
Give me your coat!
Hey, let her go!
- What are you doing?
- Stop!
Let him go!
Give me your coat or I'm gonna kill you!
Stop!
Stop!
National Guard!
Stop!
Are you okay?
Stop!
What the hell are you two doing out here?
This city's been evacuated!
- To where?
- To shelters.
Hell, you guys are lucky I found you.
I was on my last sweep.
Let's go!
But what about the glacier?
Isn't it headed right for us?
Not for long.
There's a combined taskforce on its way to meet it.
So you've declared war on a glacier?
That's right.
It's the last chunk of the glacier, and they're putting everything they have on it.
Now get your asses inside before I have you arrested!
Go!
Go!
That's the last of the explosives, major.
Good, good!
All explosives have been deployed.
Roger that.
The charges are in place!
Take us back home!
Copy that.
Prepare for extraction.
Roger that.
Hey, Nelson.
Grab the computer.
I wanna find out... if we can connect to a satellite at this altitude.
Got it.
Should take a sec.
Reception blows up here.
I got a signal.
What do you want me to do?
Okay, I want you to connect up to the noaa website.
I wanna find out where that glacier is right now.
Got it.
What's the login?
Login is username Julia,
Password, Nelson.
Dad, that's lame.
That is sweet.
Lame or not, open up the tracking program.
Now run the simulation with the same coordinates,
But put in our GPS location right now.
What are you looking for?
Trying to find out how far away we are from that glacier.
Okay, it's 50 miles behind us.
It's moving at 200 miles an hour.
What?
How can a glacier move at 200 miles per hour?
I have no idea.
I don't think anybody else does either.
Can we outrun that?
Are we gonna make it on time?
Let's find out.
What's wrong?
We're icing up.
Doesn't this model have de-icers?
No.
We're gonna have to fly low if we're gonna make it.
We're burning fuel like crazy.
I need you guys to look outside... and see if you can find any kind of private airfield, a crop dusting operation, anything.
You guys finding anything?
How far away are we from New York?
Can't be more than 100 miles.
You guys seeing anything?
I don't see anything.
This visibility sucks balls.
Nelson!
Okay, guys, hold on.
We're gonna go lower.
Anything?
Nope, nothing.
We're still collecting a lotta ice.
I may have to put her down at any time, guys.
How much more ice can this thing take?
Not a lot.
These headwinds are killing us.
We could walk there faster.
How much further is it?
About another 10 minutes.
I'm gonna try to land her at Newark or La Quardia.
Will they allow us to land without a flight plan?
Well, I'll just radio ahead... and tell them we're an emergency.
They have to let us land.
What if there's no one there to hear us?
Oh, crap!
What?
We just ran out of fuel in the right fuel tank!
Okay, guys, strap yourselves in.
Get ready.
We're gonna have to go for an emergency landing.
Really, Bill?
Yes!
Get ready!
God, look at all of these people.
Well, at least we get free cookies.
You think your parents are still trying to find us?
I hope so.
What about your family?
Dad's in northern Europe near Oslo.
It's probably the first hit.
It's okay.
I'm happy to be with you.
Okay, you guys.
We gotta get serious about finding another place to land, because we're not gonna make it to Newark.
We're entering into the New York air corridor now.
I'm gonna get on the radio... and see if anybody's there listening.
Give me the radio there, Nelson.
Newark tower, this is Cessna... where's the flight number?
Give me the flight number.
This is cessna number November niner, niner, 7-2-5.
Declaring an emergency.
Do you copy?
Can they even hear us?
Oh, I don't know.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, we're gonna find a hole and slip into it.
Buckle up, guys.
One way or another, we're gonna be on the ground... in a couple of minutes, so hold on.
I need you guys to look around... to see if you can see any other aircraft...
That might be landing without tower permission, okay?
Brace yourselves!
Two o'clock!
Look!
You okay?
You all right?
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay.
We're down.
Okay, okay.
Let's get out, guys.
Come on.
Come on out.
Come on, guys.
Here we go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Well, I guess we got out just in time.
Hey, guys, look.
It's New York.
We did it!
Almost there.
Yeah.
Did you crash that one eighty?
Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
I got all the insurance information if you need it.
If a crashed Cessna was all we had to worry about,
I'd call it a good day.
Come with me.
Let's get you into someplace safe.
Colonel sinor, this is command.
We are less than 30 seconds from detonation.
Roger that.
We are all clear and standing by.
Give me a long count, captain.
Fire!
We got to get out of here.
Were you guys headed into Manhattan?
Yeah, because we're trying to get our daughter.
I'm sorry.
No one's getting in and out of New York alive.
Just stay here.
The National Guard's gonna be here to get you.
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.
I'll be right...
Oh!
Oh!
Come on, get back!
Get back!
We just gotta stay away from tall buildings... with lots of glass, got it?
Dad, we're going to Manhattan.
Point taken.
So how we gonna get there?
We got to get ourselves another car... and then just drive into the city.
- And go where?
- To the dorm.
The dorm?
She's not at the dorm and you know that.
We can only hope she got our message.
What, to go to Florida?
Look, she may not be in New York,
But we have start there.
From there, maybe we'll be able to find
Some sort of clue where she...
Are you willing to sacrifice?
Hey, guys!
Are we going or what?
Were the keys in the ignition?
I don't wanna know.
I don't even want to know.
Let's just go.
I'm gonna try and get hold of her again.
If we're in jersey, how far is New York?
Well, it shouldn't be too much longer.
We're coming up to the george washington bridge.
No signal.
It just keeps saying that all circuits are busy now.
It's not going through.
We just need to get under the gw.
I'll try to get the gps running.
Is everyone trying to get to New York?
Look at that mess.
Nelson, see if you can find another way to the bridge.
Sir, you're gonna have to turn your car around.
You can't get through here.
We have to get to Manhattan.
That's impossible.
No one's going over there.
No, our daughter is there, and we need to pick her up.
I don't care if the pope's over there.
No one's going in New York right now.
Look, it's not gonna matter soon anyway.
Please just let us go.
But you can't go.
Washington bridge, it's out.
Wow!
The Air Force is coming in for their last air strike.
Let's hope that does it,
Or maybe none of us will get out of here.
Come on, let's go!
What are you gonna do now, Bill?
I don't know.
I'm out of ideas.
I know that's not true.
I know that you're thinking something.
What?
Oh, it's just that
Remember when the kids were really, really young... and we thought that if we could put... some sort of tracking device on them, we'd always know where they are?
I knew I should have invented that device.
Damn it!
Wait, wait, guys!
We do have a tracking device!
What are you talking about, Nelson?
Oh, of course!
Of course what?
Even if we can't talk to her on her phone, we can track her phone.
Really?
We can do that?
Yes.
Isn't that illegal?
Don't ask.
I got it!
She's in New Jersey!
New Jersey?
She's here!
She's in New Jersey!
Oh, my god, Bill.
Where?
Um... four miles that way.
Two more miles.
Hurry, Bill!
Okay, people, this is it!
Stay back.
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment is at hand!
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment is at hand!
Repent now, sinners!
Judgment...
How far are we?
1.7 miles.
Which way do we go?
There's gonna be a dead end on your left,
So we have to go right.
Okay, guys, here we go.
Hold on a second!
T minus 2 minutes for launch.
Okay, well, we're not getting through this.
How far away is she?
Dad, she's just two blocks away.
Okay, we're going on foot, guys.
Come on.
Let's go.
What's the gps say?
She's that way!
One more block this way!
Just over a block!
Oh!
Dad, my phone!
Got to get my phone to find her!
Nelson, listen to me.
We'll find her.
Forget it, forget it!
We don't have time!
Let's go.
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!

Julia!
Julia!
Look!
What the hell?
That's my dad.
Julia!
Dad!
Dad!
Julia!
Daddy!
I got her!
Let's go!
Daddy!
Oh, Julia, are you okay?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
Oh, my god.
Oh, thank god.
Oh, baby.
Hi, baby.
Oh, I can't believe it!
We got her.
You all right?
Let me see you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Dad, this is Logan.
Hi, Logan.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's get to safety, guys.
Come on.
Dad, drive!
Dad, get us out of here!
The bridges are down, streets are blocked, the river's frozen.
What are we gonna do?
Daddy?
Are you driving on the Hudson river?
Is it gonna hold?
It didn't last time.
Last time?
What?
You see that?
Those are F-16s going in!
What was that?
Sounds like something big just blew up.
We're not gonna be able to outrun it!
What are we gonna do?
We cannot keep going on like this!
I know!
I'm trying to find a way off the river!
Any ideas?
How about that?
Okay, if we can make it.
Glacier appears to be breaking up.
Okay, everybody out!
Let's go!
Okay, go on through!
Come on through!
Let's go!
No, no, no, forget it.
Forget it.
Let's go upstairs!
Keep going!
Hurry!
Okay, get down.
Get down.
Honey.
Hear anything?
No.
Is it done?
Hold on.
Come on.
Come on up.
You okay?
Yeah.
Oh.
You're probably wondering why I brought you here today.
- Not really.
- Check it!
All the richest people in history have drinks named after them.
Shirley Temple, Arnold Palmer, John F. Lemonade.
What drink's gonna make me rich you ask?
I'll tell you what!
One can of RadiCola, frozen fruit juice concentrate, a dash of hot sauce...
Sugar Roasted Sugar Bombs for texture, and the rest...
Mordecai, witness The RigJuice!
Dude, I don't think you should drink that.
My face feels like magic.
Dude, wanna taste?
I'm not dumb enough to drink that stuff.
Come on, we do dumb stuff all the time!
We're like two peas in a pod.
No we're not..
I'm definitely smarter than you.
It's been that way ever since you dropped out of high school.
Dude what?
I don't need no high school education.
You can't use everything from school in everyday life.
Hey, Mordecai and Rigby.
I got a question for you.
So, you know those six turtles at the park petting zoo?
Each one needs a turtle fence.
Assuming each turtle needs nine square feet of space,
I need you guys to figure out the minimum number of nine foot planks used for construction.
Whoa, Whoa, slow down, Benson.
Rigby can't answer that question.
He doesn't have a high school diploma.
You don't have a diploma?
Thanks for wasting my time.
Where's Skips?
I'll go ask him.
Ask Skips what?
Oh, just about some math problem that Rigby doesn't know how to solve.
STOP TALKING!
Just because I couldn't solve some math problem, doesn't make you more smarter than me!
Check that grammar, bro!
"More Smart", not "More Smarter".
Didn't you learn that in high school?
LEARN THIS!
A high school diploma never got nobody nothin' and that's a fact!
Free Burgers!
Free Burgers for all high school graduates!
I'm a high school graduate!
I got my diploma right here!
NOOO!
No, wait!
I've got my diploma!
Come baack!
You misspelled "Diploma" dude.
That's it!
I'm going back to high school!
Eh, doesn't sound like a good idea to me.
Our friendship wouldn't work if we're both smart.
What?
What are you talking about?
We're both the same amount of smart as each other!
No, you're not!
I'm the smart one, and you're my friend.
That's our dynamic, dude.
I have a High School diploma, and you don't.
I'm gonna get my diploma, and we'll see how you like being the dumb one!
Well, class, this is quite possibly the hardest math problem in the world, whoever can solve it will be leaving the classroom today with a diploma in their hands
Did you say diploma?
That... is correct!
Congratulations, Rigby, you won't need to go near another school for the rest of your life!
- RIGBY!
- Huh?
Wha?
Can I get my diploma now?
Get outta my class, Rigby.
- You fell asleep in class, didn't you?
- SHUT UP!
You wouldn't fall asleep so much if you had your High School diploma
That lousy High School diploma.
I can get my diploma the easy way, online.
Welcome to the Education Mentor.

I got this.

I'll just drink a month's worth of doses, I mean it doesn't say not to.
I Know This Now.
Wait A Minute I Know Everything.
Hey, I know something that can help you with that crossword.
It's called a High School diploma.
Very amusing Mordecai.
缺缺缺Perhaps you can assist me with this.
Tell me, what's an eight letter word for idiot?
What?
Why are you talking like that?
I tried imbicule,bonehead, peabrain, oh wait!
I got it.
Mordecai.
You're the idiot!
You Dumbface!
I'm afraid while dumbface fits, it's simply too stupid to fit in this puzzle.
Face it Mordecai, I'm the smartest now.
What is that?
That isn't RigJuice!
- BrainMax?
- Get your hands off that!
Gimme that!
First of all, I wanna contradict your earlier statement, Rigby.
This theory proves you're dumber than me.
As you can see by my encounter theory, it is you, that you are dumber than me.
Tsk.
Tsk.
Wait till you see my 20 page research paper backing up with my theory.
Tsk.
Tsk.
I'm gonna write a 21 page paper backing up my theory
AND prove yours wrong!
Tsk.
Tsk.
Is that so.
Tsk.
Tsk.
Yeah!
In closing, you're theories had failed to prove that you're smarter.
For your brain is no bigger than a walnut.
Very funny Mordecai, but your paper is fundlementally flawed because your brain is made of 99% K9 butt cheeks.
There is still one fuerable truth.
You don't have a High School diploma, so I'm smarter than you.
You imbecile.
I am not an imbecile!
If a diploma will prove that I'm smarter than you, than so be it!
I can't read it!
Probably because you're still too stupid.
Here.
What kind of writing is this?
Mordecai.
Rigby.
You guys-
Mordecai!
Rigby!
Get downstairs right now and clean down the mess you made or I'm gonna fire you-
Dude, what is he saying?
Oh no.
We've become so smart, they're stupid to us.
If you haven't made fun of me so much, none of this would've happened!
Whatever.
If you cant even get your diploma because we're so smart.
So what's the point.
You're right.
There is no point.
What's the point of being so smart, if you can't even understand anyone.
We have to get stupid again.
How?
RigJuice.
The fridge.
The RigJuice!
Pour me some.
It looks... different now.
Ready.
Wait.
If I drink this, I'll never get my diploma.
Dude, it's just a piece of paper.
I know that, but you'll never stop making fun of me for it.
I don't care, I won't make fun of you for it I promise...
To being stupid?
To being stupid.
Bottoms up.
...Did that work?
And if you stop goofing off and clean up this graffiti now
I'm gonna tear you from limb to limb!
Do you have anything to say for yourselves?
What just happened?
I don't remember anything...
Me and Fives were practicing for our pie contest, when you dudes came and were speaking Spanish or something.
Then you drink that green stuff.
I can't believe you made me drink your lame drink.
Better get started, or it's getting out of your paycheck.
Yeah, losers!
You know, maybe if you had a High School diploma, we wouldn't be in this mess.
Well guess what, this drop out somehow got you to drink RigJuice.
I'll get the paint.
That's good RigJuice.

Han Yoo Kyung!
The relationship between us is finished.
It was you who broke up with me.
No, I hadn't.
It hasn't ended yet!
Episode 15
Jung Eun.
The flower...
The flower has been trampled.
It's already over with Han Yoo Kyung.
Don't waste any more thoughts on her.
You don't know anything.
It's not that.
Between the three of you, are there still secrets unknown to me?
Why is it so complicated?
It's not too late.
If you don't want this, you can still give it up.
All you have to do is take my hand, and leave here.
Where is the car?
I cannot stay here.
Let go of me.
Let go!
You're... just trying to mess with me, aren't you?
That's why you're like this?
Why Jung Eun?
Why must it be Seo Jung Eun?
!
Why can't it be her?
Did Jung Eun know where you were?
Even Kang Woo wasn't aware of your whereabouts.
We've lived together for 6 years.
With Myung Ja ahjumma and Han Byul we've been living together.
How can... that be?
Please.
Today is a very important day for me.
Don't intrude into my life again.
You won't let me come?
It's been 6 years, Yoo Kyung.
Can I not have my own happiness?
After I was discarded by you into the darkest depths,
Do you know how difficult and unbearable it was?
From that darkness Jung Eun who rescued me.
In your eyes, I am merely the manager of a clothing shop, but in Jung Eun's eyes, I am the greatest man of earth.
Let me live my life this way.
I understand.
I understand completely.
Where are we going?
Just up ahead is the entrance to the highway.
From there, we can go anywhere.
Exactly where is that?
There is nowhere for me to go.
I have nothing and... no place I can go.
All I have left is... my mother and my daughter.
What do you mean you have nothing?
Don't you have Young Jo?
I've even admitted to Young Jo that I've undeniably lost to him.
Not long after it was revealed you were an unwed mother, he begun the arrangements for your engagement.
How long... can you let a man like him wait?
Mi Ryun.
What's happening?
She didn't bring her cell phone.
All she'd said was that she was delivering flowers to you.
Ah1
Give Kang Woo a call.
He was searching for her earlier.
It's Young Jo.
Don't tell him I saw Yoo Kyung.
Hello.
I'm with Jung Eun.
We're coming back now.
Is Jung Eun alright?
She's fine.
Her flowers had wilted, so she wanted to go find a flower shop.
Flower shop?
Wait a second, Kang Woo.
Yoo Kyung came by...
did Jung Eun see her?
No, of course not.
We'll return immediately.
How does my face look?
Yes...
It's fine.
Um...
Young Jo has come out.
Where did you go?
I'm only a little late.
You're not only someone who's late, but someone who consistently stands me up.
My heart clenched with fear thinking I'd been stood up again.
Where could I have gone?
All my three sets* are all here.
(*meaning all of her love ones are here)
We've waited a while but finally our main couple for today have arrived.
As he is on temporary leave from work, the groom will soon have to return following the photos.
But he intends to be the unyielding support behind the bride's acting career.
At the present, Mr. L Mo's current liability is $5 Million won to the bank
It's rather frustrating.
The only hope we have is to wish for our noona to become famous quickly.
Seo Jung Eun, fighting!
- Fighting!
- Seo Jung Eun!
- Seo Jung Eun!
- Seo Jung Eun!
Hyung, if you ever let my sister cry, I won't let you get away with it.
What?
What are you saying?
Can't you tell that those are tears of happiness?
Jung Eun, you won't ever have to cry again.
Aigoo!
How much has she suffered all these years...
Why are you like this on such a happy day?
Just watching them makes me want to cry.
Lee Young Jo!
Seo Jung Eun!
Wish for Smash Hit!
- Lee Young Jo!
Lee Young Jo!
- Seo Jung Eun!
Seo Jung Eun!
Sit, sit.
Of all places...
How dare come to this place?
You haven't changed at all.
Age has left not one mark upon you.
You seem... even younger than before.
What are you doing here?
!
Hmmm, my son has cast
Seo Jung Eun as the lead, so I was curious as to who she was.
And I find out she's Lee Ae Rin's daughter.
Ah, really...
Fate plays such frightening games, hmm?
How dare you, speak the word 'fate' from your lips!
Hey, now.
Why be like this on such a happy day?
I have some measure of conscience.
When I'd snatched her from your side that day, did you think that I felt no guilt?
But now that she has been reunited with her mother, given birth to a daughter, and found a good husband, only happiness awaits her.
Congratulations.
Leave here immediately.
Don't you dare meddle in my daughter's life.
Ahh...
Seriously...
Your daughter is an actress.
As the President of a film company, how can I pretend to not know?
Isn't that the case, huh?
Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
Hey...
Isn't that Choi Jung Dal?
- What is that man doing here?
- No Unni, he's already left.
We should be having our photos taken.
Unni, let's go.
Go.
Even if it does concerns her career, now is not the time for it.
This is the engagement party.
The engagement!
My goodness.
Let go of me.
Han Byul, did you have fun today?
Yes.
Uncle.
Can I call you 'father' now?
Father?
Grandma has let me practice.
Father.
Father.
What is it?
Han Byul, your mother seems to be a little jealous.
I'm sorry.
I have to go and can't take you home today.
I have to go to work and can't take you home.
It's fine.
You should return to your work.
I may not even be able to call.
Drive safely.
Han Byul... be sure to hang onto your mother, don't let her run off.
Yes, Father.
Bye bye.
I'll go now.
Bye bye!
I... am not only a mother who has abandoned her child.
I have also abandoned a man.
That man... doesn't even know that he has a child in this world.
I hadn't meant for you to find out.
You saw me.
Barging in to another's engagement ceremony, how could I have not known.
Say it.
All that you have guessed is true.
Han Byul... is that person's daughter.
You are inhuman.
A monster.
Her father was right in front of her, yet you gave his child away.
You knew perfectly well, he would've cared for her.
You knew how much loved him.
Yet you left... his child for me to place in adoption.
When you got caught for the CCTV, you did it on purpose too.
Didn't you?
When you snatched him from me like that, you should at least lived well with him.
Why?
Why did you do this?
I also wished to live in peace.
Haven't I said, we are enemies.
HeaJu Pictures... was Lee Ae Rin's film company.
His grandfather seized the film company.
And as soon as I was born, snatched me and dumped me in an orphanage.
The one who took me there was Young Jo's father.
So you had to become the same as him?
Young Jo oppa...
Before he was 16, he had no idea that his mother was still alive.
How could you have been so cruel to someone that pitiful?
It was I who was abandoned.
Those people abandoned me!
How can you still not understand my heart?
I don't understand what there is to fear of you,
When you are nothing more than a spoiled child.
W...
What?
No matter how difficult it is to continue on,
If you only change your heart to forgive, everybody could've been happy.
It was you who ruined everything.
I will never...
let Han Byul find you.
All I need to do is hold onto him.
Then Han Byul would come to me herself, would she not?
That person... will never forgive you once he knows what you've done.
What exactly can a coward like you do about it?
He will... forgive me.
I am his child's mother.
As you mentioned, he's lonely and tender-hearted person so what can he do to me?
Do you think... you are an angel and I am the demon, right?
There's no difference between us.
You agreed to be engagement, because you feared you'd lose Han Byul.
But why Lee Young Jo?
Is it merely... because he is of use to you?
Take that thermos over there with you.
It's from your home.
Mother brought me porridge without telling you.
This is what blood is.
She'll forgive me without prejudice no matter what acts of cruelty I've committed.
That's what blood relationships are.
Yet with you, you have no such thing.
My mother.
My daughter.
My daughter's father.
Ultimately they are all mine, are they not?
You cannot take them away.
You have no right.
Manager.
It hasn't ended yet.
It hasn't ended!
Seo Han Byul...
Hello.
Who do you resemble to be so beautiful?
Ta-da!
For your daughter.
Mother!
Aigoo.
Has Han Byul slept well?
Mother!
Huh?
Is your mother not in her room?
Where has she gone?
I haven't seen her.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Wake up!
What is it?
Did you have a bad dream?
No, I haven't.
Hurry up and call father.
Roll it properly.
Noona, what were you doing in the room of the absent groom?
I wanted to straighten it up, but I guess I was too tired.
Mother, take a picture of me.
After you come back from school.
No, right now.
I need to send it to father.
Aigoo, how well she's saying 'daddy' after just one night!
Mother, mother!
Han Byul, there's no time.
Mother, mother!
Han Byul, come here.
Uncle will take it.
Noona, give me your phone.
Alright... here is the special stage of Seo Han Byul, who has recently returned from from her international tour.
The song's name is...
The song is called 'Adorable Children'.
Aigoo, who is that?
She sings well.
- Your daughter is beautiful.
- Yes.
Manager.
Let's go, Han Byul.
Mother, it's father.
He's so handsome.
Mother, let's print this picture.
I said we have to go now.
- Mother, mother!
- Why are you being like this?
!
Go get ready.
Um...
Han Byul, come here.
Uncle will do it for you.
Come.
Come.
Noona, what's wrong?
Uncle will do it for you.
- Oh, you've come.
- Hello.
- Come in.
- Teacher!
- Han Byul.
- This is my father.
Oh, how handsome!
- How handsome!
- He is.
He's my father.
Oh, he's handsome!
Let's go, Han Byul.
- Han Byul, let's go.
- Goodbye.
Everyone, this is my father!
Aigoo, our Han Byul is so pretty.
Come over here.
Your engagement photos are here.
This one should be for your mother-in-law's house.
I'm a little busy right now.
Right...
If I were you, I wouldn't want to go there either.
She's been giving her so much misery...
It's alright, then I will go.
Take a look at this.
The photo has come out quite well.
Have a look.
What's with you?
I have to...
go to the studio.
Aigoo, that child...
Just like her mother.
How can she be so sensitive?
Aigoo.
A child who never said 'daddy' once in her life saying 'daddy, daddy' constantly.
And she...
No matter how difficult it's been single-handedly raising a child, she should still go to visit.
Maybe it's because that she felt lost after suffered all these years...
I'm going out now.
All right.
Is... there something troubling you?
There isn't.
Is it that...
Yoo Kyung also knows of... your engagement?
Soon Geum unni asked me... who is the child's biological father.
Did you hear...
anything from Yoo Kyung?
We're enemies.
So how can I know much about her?
Jung Eun... you once said that, when Yoo Kyung was young she was an angel.
I am so thankful for your having said that.
No.
I detest her now.
You think that she is so pitiful, so unfortunate...
I don't want to talk about this anymore with you.
It isn't easy for you either.
If the two of us end up in a fight, who would you help?
You fool!
Why ask such a thing?
I agree...
Yoo Kyung... has done another terrible thing?
Hasn't she.
What is it?
Tell me.
It's not like that!
Hello?
I'm going down now.
What's going on?
The representative of the investment company has come.
What's happened?
Is seems that our grant wasn't approved.
He said it was because of your father.
If I had known that that conniving old man was going to do this, maybe he should've been the investment representative from the start.
I've stood my ground against accepting his money, but it seems we have no other choice
Your father... and I are in the same boat now.
Do you know what that means?
Since we may be allies today and enemies tomorrow, you should give serious thought to where you stand.
You would've ended up coming to me anyway so why did you hold out on me?
Time is money, you rascal.
I will accept your investment on one condition.
I will make no changes to the script.
Don't come to the filming site or the editing room.
When will you grow up?
After watching what Young Jo has done, you definitely can't underestimate him.
I am sure there's a family story behind it.
What I'm saying is, ultimately the fight will be between you and Young Jo.
I... won't do anything other than films.
I have no interest at all in your money.
Thinking about it, I am not even human.
To use excuses of finding the child by things I've done to you...
Isn't this the lady you've persistently wanted as your lead?
There are rumors circulating everywhere, saying that you have secretly loved her for 7 years.
Those are only rumors.
There is no such thing.
Of course.
That's as it should be.
Isn't she to be Young Jo's wife?
Really...
You can't even handle having a woman like that, snatched away from you.
You foolish punk!
This kind of life, is only cared about by womenfolk.
When you turned it over to me why not just let me do it the way I want?
Why won't you listen to me?
Is it because I'm too poor or because I don't love you?
So you immediately...
Why won't you listen to me?
Is it because I'm too poor or...
In front of your secret love of 17 years, why such an expression?
I'm very sensitive to Spring Fever.
Seo Jung Eun... this hand belongs to from now on.
It's quite amazing.
It can beat Young Jo into dust, and can grab hold of Jung Eun and run.
So feel free to make use of it.
So what I'm saying is, just think of it as you've got the insurance and be happy.
Jung Eun, you have that right.
Open your hand.
The sweetest candy in the world.
If there's time before you start, do you want to grab a cup of coffee?
There is 5 minutes before assembly.
Be ready.
Jung Eun!
Jung Eun!
Jung Eun!
Kang Woo, there is good news and bad news.
Pick which you want to hear first?
Go ahead and say it.
Seo Jin cannot shoot the commercial.
All the clothing has been readied...
She's already has fitted for the dress but the president says no, because he cannot watch good things happening to Lee Young Jo.
Seo Jin is crying and making a fuss.
So Seo Jung Eun has a chance now?
Bingo.
I can't do it.
I have no charisma.
The designer will make the decision.
This is an audition too.
Let's just touch up your makeup.
Are you still thinking about the audition and not getting any sleep?
They should be using a famous model, instead of me.
Didn't they say that HeaJu is doing this on purpose?
That's why well known models aren't daring to participate.
There are many rumors floating around.
What are the rumors saying?
Ah...
No, teacher it's not like that.
Oh look, there's a little mark there.
It just needs... a few touchups, then it will be amazing.
What are you doing?
Are you doing this against your will too?
Oh, aren't you the one from the new drama?
The one whose acting was better than Seo Jin's.
Of course.
She's was to be the next Seo Jin Eun.
And then?
And then... it was revealed that she was an unwed mother...
But then, after she became engaged to a businessman, Mr. L Mor things took a better turn.
Leave us for now.
Take off your clothes.
Are you sure you've had a child?
It doesn't look like it.
This dress is beautiful.
If it doesn't sell, I'll prick you like this.
How will you portray this dress?
What?
I'm telling you to think of a story.
It reminds me of the story of... the weaver girl and the cowherd.
Although it all originates when the cowherd lied secretly hiding the weaver girl's robes, they moved heaven and earth to be together.
The weaver girl found happiness.
She gave birth to 2 children and the love between them grew.
Yet as soon as she found her robes, she left for the heavens leaving the cowherd behind.
I feel as though...
I am that cowherd.
Continue.
I feel it may have been too extravagant of a present.
That which I had thought was mine, actually is not.
My mother is not...
My daughter is not...
Even that person... is not mine.
Is there anything that's yours in this world?
My kid?
Definitely doesn't belong to me.
I feel foolish for holding on tightly.
What will I do once they all fly away at once?
All this insecurity and fear... there is no one
I can share it with.
Just remember this emotion during the shoot.
Why are you crying?
Because you keep pricking me with the pins.
Just like that... 1, 2, 3.
One more... 1, 2, 3.
All right, let's change the pose.
Good.
Yes.
Good, just like that.
Yes.
More brilliance.
1, 2, 3.
Good.
Good.
Yes it's good.
Yes.
Yes.
Very good.
Yes.
Ready for the picture now?
Good.
Now, change your expression. 1, 2, 3.
Good.
Just like that.
To the side.
Look at the camera.
Look forward.
Yes. 1, 2, 3.
Do you see?
The photos all came out well.
What do you mean 'well'?
The bride's coloring is terrible.
Everybody was making big fuss over how the groom's mother looks so young.
Unni, what have you had done to your face?
How can it, appear even younger than mine?
I still don't like your daughter.
Aigoo, In-law!
Since you have given your blessing on their marriage, give her a break.
you should bestow your favor on her.
Are you taking me lightly because my situation was similar?
Then you have made the gravest of errors.
What are you saying?
I am only a widow, not an unwed mother.
Don't even know who's seed it is.
And I don't like the fact that she's Lee Ae Rin's daughter!
Aigoo.
She doesn't even have any friends, just the one called Yang Mi Ryun.
No.
I've seen another friend of hers.
Jung Eun's friend?
Who?
I don't know her name.
But when you disappeared, she stopped me in the HeaJu parking lot, saying that she was a friend of your daughter.
And?
I've corrected it.
Please make note of the changes.
Sure.
Have the business team come over here.
Aigoo.
I have a premiere to attend.
- Then go ahead.
- Ah...
However, we are limited in time.
You and Kang Woo have delayed it too long.
I'll see you later.
This... what shall we do while they are fixing it?
I'll play with you.
Oh, when I went to New York last time...
I met Monica ahjumma.
Monica?
By any chance...
Young Joo?
She knows that the minister's daughter is marrying.
How... does she know?
The groom's brother is also in New York?
He's her neighbor.
Oh, and...?
How can those with sight feign no knowledge?
If that Monica says a few words to her good neighbor... then your daughter's wedding will be in jeopardy.
You!
Wh... what exactly do you want me to do?
Vice President, you are my hostage.
What do you want then?
Make your demands clear.
I want the secret account books in your possession.
What?
What do you mean?
How can I have such a thing?
Choi Jung Dal's secret account books are all in my hands.
Everything you said at the restaurant that time has been recorded.
Also what Monica ahjumma told me about you... is also recorded.
Oh...!
I'm going to go crazy!
Something has happened!
Something has happened!
They're saying to stop the distribution.
What?
Why?
It should have been reported immediately.
What's happened?
The shipment has to be delivered by tomorrow.
Even if it arrives at the store, not one of them will sell.
The court has ordered disciplinary action to cease all sales.
How exactly are you handling things here?
A court order to cease sales...?
On what grounds?
HeaJu has said that we have stolen their designs and they are going to sue us.
That's impossible.
These are all Miss Jang Ji Hyun's designs.
Investigation of this case will take at least a month.
By then, the season will have ended.
What will we do with 200 thousand garments?
How are you handling this, huh?
How can you register someone else's design as yours?
!
Do you have any proof?
Proof?
That design, was presented by me first.
I've requested an investigation from the Paris Association.
Cancel it before you get humiliated.
In order for the document to arrive...
It should take about a month...
By then, all the UVIO shops will close...
Ms. Jang... will have to deal with the humiliation of having her very first brand go wrong.
If you want a fight, fight against me.
What have they done to deserve this?
It was only by their own involvement that they were brought into this.
But Chairman Park, is a veteran who's been through hell and high-water.
You should worry about how to save yourself.
You're not finished with us, are you?
What else do you want?
Then... strip out the labels... from all the garments you've produced and sell them all to HeaJu Group.
That way, you'll recover some of your expenses.
UVIO will bankrupt but... but you can still survive.
Continue to talk of loyalty, then you both will sink together.
[ Our Kiddo ]
Yes, Hak Gu.
Noona, help me find Young Jo.
The factory and stores are in a mess, but we've been unable to contact him.
If you see Young Jo, tell him to just go along with what Lee Young Guk wants, okay?
Understand?
Hey, that won't work.
Ahee... really!
Don't you want your salary?
Aigoo, aigoo.
I finally understand why Young Jo has hidden his identity for the past 6 years.
How can he force his own brother out of home penniless, to suffer like that for all those years...
With great difficulty he got back on his feet and now he's trying to bury him again?
My goodness, I have such pity for our Young Jo, husband.
Our Young Jo is so pitiful.
This sum of money can be entered into the ledger now.
Then we will begin the work immediately.
Good.
If you had cooperated with us from the beginning, then you would've already turned a great profit.
If you had sold the HeaJu's shares that time, you wouldn't be in this state now.
From now on, I will give you much guidance.
Why can there be such a bitter fight, between two brothers?
President Lee Young Duk feels that his father was snatched away by Young Jo.
Besides, once he heard that his grandfather had left the HeaJu shop to Young Jo, he flew into an infuriated rage.
Their father...
What kind of a person was he?
In order to live with Han Soo's mother, his father threw him out of the house, and died of grave hardships.
Young Jo's situation is exactly that of his father's.
Then... wasn't he working at his father's side?
No, he wasn't.
He'd given up all of it, and was building his riches from scratch.
Then... what about Lee Ae Rin?
He didn't have any relationship with Lee Ae Rin.
At the height of Lee Ae Rin's fame,
Young Jo's father had already passed away.
Who was it who took away the baby?
Everything... was by the orders of the old man.
Young Jo's father orchestrated it all.
[ Yoo Kyung ]
- Hello?
- It's me.
I know.
It's been a long time.
The thermos...
I should return it to you.
I'm sorry to have made you come so far.
It didn't take long by car.
You'd once said, that I could ask you directly about anything.
You... want to know who took the child away.
You must be curious.
It wasn't Young Jo's grandfather.
What?
Although he was very niggardly and unsentimental, he would never have committed such an atrocity.
Then... who was... the one who discarded me... at birth?
Choi Jung Dal...
Kang Woo's father.
But I believe if I had stood my ground back then,
I could have protected you.
These explanations are merely excuses now.
I was... utterly senseless then.
Does saying all this now erase the crime that you had committed that year?
If you had told me earlier, then I wouldn't have done all those things!
Is there more...
that I don't know of?
No.
I've already single-handedly destroyed my mother,
So what else can I possibly do?
There is nothing more.
I heard Young Jo say that your relationship with him is not good.
Was it those misunderstandings that destroyed your relationship?
How can that be?
I've accepted Choi Jung Dal's money,
And I'm producing a movie with his son.
You're working with Choi Jung Dal?
You cannot!
Just wait and see.
I will make HeaJu pay blood for blood.
I... will make HeaJu pay blood for blood.
- Yoo Kyung, don't be like this.
- People must have dreams in life.
It will rain soon.
You should return.
He is leaving
He is leaving me
Can't stop the tears
I can't even make a sound
I can only look at you from a far
I miss you, miss you
I would die loving you
I miss you, I miss you so much
I can't let you go, but I am not confident to hold you back
He is leaving
He is leaving me
Can't stop the tears
[ Lee Young Jo ]
I can't even make a sound
{\a6I can only look at you from a far
I miss you, miss you
I would die loving you
I miss you, I miss you so much
I can't let you go, but I am not confident to hold you back
What are you thinking about here?
Let's go back.
The family is waiting for us.
I've... been framed again.
Are you hungry?
Let's go home and have some dinner.
After good night's rest, you'll find a way through this.
What can I do now?
For my own...
You cannot act for yourself without consideration of others.
But that way I lose everything.
The family.
The company.
The construction materials.
Everything.
I'll return to having nothing.
Do you remember this?
I found it when I was cleaning the basement.
You used the 10,000 won you earned at the marketplace, to buy this toy.
What is there to fear?
Those days, we were happy too.
Let's go home.
[ Lee Young Jo ]
Go inside first.
I need to buy some tofu.
All right then.
Be careful on the road.
[ Yoo Kyung... ]
[ Yoo Kyung ]
It's me.
What's going on?
Han Yoo Kyung, what is it?
Yoo Kyung!
Where are you?
Where are you right now?
!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come back next time.
Hello, Kang Woo.
He's at home now.
I'll have him call you after we've finished dinner.
Yoo Kyung!
Han Yoo Kyung!
What's happened to you, huh?

Previously on Sons of Anarchy:
How's it going with the gardens?
Ah, not so good.
We don't raise another 80,000 in three weeks, it's gone.
Hey, you got a family.
You got a new wife.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Rafi, Pedro, get the crew.
They should be with the Sons.
Track those putos.
I found some of J.T.'s old letters.
John wanted to end the relationship with the Irish, stop the club from selling.
He was killed before that meeting.
Kill the drug muling or I'll let the club read the letters.
The history that Tara and Piney know, very dangerous.
Now, we got to stop this in its tracks.
I was hoping I could walk you to your car bend your ear a bit.
Have him, uh, pull a sample from the load, couple grams.
If he gets caught, they'll kill him.
That's the point.
Jesus, you took it?
Back at the warehouse.
Let's go.
Here.
I spotted him pulling something out.
He saw me and freaked.
He tried to kill me.
The way you handled this hard thing with Miles, I'm proud of you.
You earned this.
Shit.
What the hell, man?
Where is he?
Juice!
Juicy-boy!
There.
Hey.
Hey.
What the hell you doing?
Was pissing.
What's all this shit?
Did you take a spill?
What's that?
Oswald, man.
He's got those stupid security chains all over these back roads.
You clotheslined one?
Jackass.
Yeah.
We got to go.
What's up?
Vote.
Drugs?
Change of leadership.
Who is it?
Take the gun, stay in the back room.
Go.
Sorry about the hour, Ms. Knowles.
What is it?
We just got a call from your administrator over at St. Thomas.
She's convinced you did receive a death threat.
I didn't take it seriously.
That's why I didn't report it.
Then why did the MC post someone here to watch you?
There's a bike outside.
I'm assuming he's somewhere in the back, armed.
The answer to that question will require a warrant.
Oh, you really got it down, don't you?
I appreciate your concern, sheriff.
It's more than concern, it's my legal obligation.
So I'm gonna post a unit outside, and I'll coordinate with the hospital security.
It's more than just your safety at stake.
But I'm sure you know that.
Sorry to disturb you.
Morning, lads.
He's making chili for my mom.
Charming Gardens potluck thing.
Dude creeps me out.
Accept that.
Piney wasn't gonna proxy this vote.
Wanted a front-row seat.
You talk to him yet?
No.
So what happens if Bobby takes this vote?
Short term, not much he can do.
Pulls us away from Galindo.
Risk is too big.
Long term, maybe Bobby's a better choice.
You thinking of going that way?
Not sure.
You're staying in Clay's camp?
Look, I know it's dirty, bro.
But he's getting us whole.
Eventually, we're less desperate, make smarter choices.
Let's vote this shit.
I'm sorry, son.
I love you, Pop.
I'm with you on this.
Come on, let's go.
All right.
There's a challenge on the table.
New president.
I don't think we need the formalities of nomination.
You want the chair.
I ain't got no choice.
Okay.
Yea or nay.
Bobby taking the gavel.
Nay.
Nay.
Take this.
Go, go, go!
Come on.
There's one.
Don't move.
Stay down.
Stay down.
You okay?
Yeah.
Clear this shit out the way.
Check his ink.
Lobo Sonora.
Shit.
This woke up the whole 'hood, man.
Get this asshole to the rez.
Call the gun warehouse.
I'll reach out to Alvarez.
Oh, man.
Clay.
This is bad.
Like, "bad" bad.
What is it?
Holy shit.
That's...
It's Armando.
Riding through this world All alone
God takes your soul You're on your own
The crow flies straight A perfect line
On the devil's path Until you die
Gotta look this life In the eye
You find out what he knows.
Hey.
Come on.
You're with me.
Yeah.
That bag of heads is your "get out of drugs free" card.
What the hell you talking about?
You tell the cartel we didn't sign up for this blood feud, and you want out.
What do you think, I can just bail?
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
And you're gonna do it today, because your time is up.
If we're still in the drug business tomorrow I'm delivering those letters to the club.
Hey.
Gun warehouse is safe, but the Mayan truck got jacked.
Full load of coke on the way out to dealers.
Three of Alvarez's guys MIA.
Goddamn it.
These guys are military sharp.
How did Tucson take the news?
They had assumed the worst.
Ah.
Great.
Chocolate rain.
Yo, take this.
Got it.
Go, go.
Hey, where you going?
The cabin.
Come on, Pop.
Stay here.
We need you.
You keep your head down, boy.
Oh, come on.
Okay, lickity-split.
Lickity-split.
Lickity.
We got it handled.
Handled?
They dumped a bag of heads.
I'm living in goddamn Juarez here.
Garden fund-raiser's tonight.
Ain't gonna be any fund-raiser after this.
We can't back out.
We don't know what the hell we're dealing with here, Mom.
This noise is gonna be all over Charming.
If we hide, looks like we got something to hide from.
Fund-raiser shows Charming the Sons give a shit.
We need that.
Have Phil shadow me.
Take a grenade to get past him.
No.
Tig.
He's the only one I trust to keep you safe.
Shit.
All right, lock it down.
Let me guess.
You smell smoke?
No.
Bullets.
And based on all the calls and the looks of the clubhouse I'm guessing they were of the automatic variety.
Yeah, we noticed that.
I'm glad you're here.
Feel safer already.
Do you have any idea who it was?
No.
I don't like to point fingers but, uh, Dezarian Motorworks Tenth Street, they've been kind of pissed off at us since we expanded our custom-bike business.
Disgruntled mechanics?
Mm.
Armenians.
Very unstable people.
Well, I really appreciate your cooperation but we'll still have to conduct a full investigation.
Knock yourself out.
I really hope this attack doesn't have anything to do with the threat on Dr. Knowles.
The hospital confirmed it.
Tara and I had another chat this morning.
You know, you have a beautiful family, Jax.
Be really sad to see their daddy catch a bullet.
Yeah.
It would be.
Do you have kids?
No.
You really should.
It's good to have a reason not to die.
Your compound is a crime scene.
Lock it down, and stay the hell out of my way.
Cane.
Yeah?
Tara's fine.
I just talked to her.
She's on her way to work.
Rat's with her.
You take care of her.
Always.
Let's get out of here.
Love you.
Hey.
You gotta clear out of here.
This is a crime scene.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Where has all this mess begun?
Making chili for the fund-raiser.
I don't give a shit.
Let's go.
Where has all this mess begun?
Let him make the chili.
Stay in this kitchen, you hear?
Yes, sir.
Hey, turn that music off.
He hasn't said a word.
You sure you didn't cut out his tongue?
Not yet.
And I'm running out of ideas.
Galindo.
You told us we didn't have to worry stateside.
Lobo had no northern network.
They don't.
What's our guest saying?
Nada.
He's definitely Lobo.
Ex-military, infantry.
What's that for?
Sodium pentothal.
It'll get him talking.
Hey, Gem.
I'll take that.
Thanks.
Hey, what happened to Chaney?
Heart attack.
Oh.
Who's this?
Clay.
Long story.
Hey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, Gem.
Peace of mind.
Where you land with all this drug stuff?
Oh, I'm backing Clay.
You think he's got it handled?
Much as I can tell.
You know, he doesn't tell that much to me anymore.
I'm stuck mostly doing bitch work.
Literally.
No.
No.
Watching you is a pleasure.
He loves you, Tig.
Wouldn't trust anyone else to watch me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't shit on anything, Clay.
That Lobo says there's a rat in your crew with roots in Nogales.
He's a lying puta, ese.
It don't matter Mayan or Son.
That bitch is dead.
That guy is full of shit.
No, he's full of truth serum.
If he says the Lobo's getting intel from a Mayan, he's not lying.
A Mayan with family in Nogales.
Now, who would that be, Marcus?
Pedro.
That Pedro?
Scumbag was in my clubhouse.
That's how they knew where to hit us, where the cut and the bag was.
Hold on.
Hey, hey, hey.
Heh.
Look, if Pedro is the pipeline to Lobo then let's feed him something useful.
Our guns.
We'll tell them we're moving them out tomorrow that we're storing them here tonight.
Then you and your guys take them down.
That soldier says there's about 25 Lobos local.
I only have four other men.
I'll need support.
Oh, Jesus.
We're not exactly an infantry unit, bro.
Well, you will be, because make no mistake, gentlemen we're at war.
Yeah.
Good.
Come on, brother.
You did good.
Yeah.
Alvarez is gonna bait the hook, let Pedro know the guns will be here at 8.
I'm gonna put the prospects on the warehouse, pull Tacoma into this.
I'm gonna cancel the fund-raiser.
No, man.
It's good you be there.
Puts us somewhere else if this gets noisy.
I know every thought that's going through your head right now.
But we gotta roll as one into this.
Otherwise, we're all dead.
Yeah, I know.
You'll get your leadership vote.
Let's hope there's someone left standing to lead.
I'm gonna ride out to Mary's, see my kids.
That's good, man.
Where's Piney?
Tequila retreat.
Cabin.
I'll take a ride out, check in on him.
Appreciate it.
I'm sorry, man.
I never thought muling would lead to this shit.
I know.
We're in it now, brother.
Got to get it done, move past it.
Yeah.
CSU is there now.
We're putting it together.
I know your wife's been working really hard on this Charming Gardens event.
Well, it's her fund-raiser.
You know, the Sons of Anarchy via Teller-Morrow are all over this thing.
I think it's too dangerous, I want you to cancel it.
That won't be necessary.
Can you promise the violence that happened this morning won't repeat?
The only thing I can promise is that I'll do my job.
I've seen firsthand what happens when the club's business bleeds into this town.
My brother died because of it.
No disrespect for the dead, but how long are you gonna beat that drum?
You're way out of line, lieutenant.
And where are those lines, mayor?
You know, the ones that separate public service from self service?
This isn't about my real estate...
Oh, sure it is!
You can wrap it in any type of "I love Charming" package that you want.
But it still funnels back to your pocket.
Now, I will have adequate protection at the fund-raiser.
Charming will be safe.
I'm going over your head on this.
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
That chili ready yet?
No, it's got to simmer for, like, a long time.
No, it's simmered enough.
Give me two bowls of it.
Hey.
Thought you were in surgery today.
I've been pulled.
Apparently, the hospital feels my presence there is a threat.
Ah, shit.
Am I crazy, Gemma?
Why do I believe him when he says it'll get better?
Because he means it.
No one saw this coming, baby.
I hate this shit too.
I'm trying this his way.
I really am.
I know you are.
So does Jax.
We pull through, and we stick it out.
That's what family does.
Come on.
Let's go check on that chili.
Come on.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's good.
Unique flavor.
Good chili.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey, uh, hang on, Gemma.
Hang on.
It's not ready.
Gemma, hey.
Hey.
Did you follow the recipe?
I had to add a few things of my own.
I can see that.
Is it spicy?
Uh, very.
Actually made my eyes burn.
What?
May have gotten in over my head.
Yeah, it's an old family recipe.
It's a delicate process.
I probably should've made it myself.
Uh, why don't you take it up to the reservation?
I think Happy likes it that hot.
Yeah.
I accept that.
Elliot.
Bring me out here to pick flowers?
Something like that.
Town needs 75K to save this place.
So I hear.
You and me are gonna cover it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Charming needs a hero, Elliot.
Hale's backing on Charming Heights is gonna fall apart.
Next time the eminent domain vote comes before city council it's got to lose.
You promised you wouldn't shit on this.
We sway public opinion against Hale.
He loses the 99 on-ramp, and all that land reverts back to you.
We all win.
Hale will just find another way.
Eh.
Two-year term.
He's already spent a year funneling policy into his own pocket.
These people ain't stupid.
Where you going with this?
I ain't going anywhere.
That's the point.
I know who I am, what I do.
Keeping Charming the way it is, that's what I get out of this.
I got no agenda here.
I just want my town back.
Think about it.
I'll see you later.
Well, well, well.
You on task or is this a, uh, social call?
I'm just checking in.
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I know you and Clay have been going at it over this whole cartel thing.
You don't know anything.
Look, I get it.
You're pissed.
I'm just trying to tell you my side of it.
Do you have a side anymore?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
For ten years, I gave up on this club.
Rode my limit just to keep the patch.
And then you came up.
You reminded me so much of John.
Just...
It felt like maybe our idea still had a chance.
Well, I'm not my old man.
Oh, I'm very clear on that now.
You need to rip him off the pedestal, Piney.
J.T. Bailed on all of us.
You trying to tell me you didn't know about Maureen Ashby?
About Trinity?
Maureen was a distraction.
When your brother took a turn for the worse, your dad was right back here.
Yeah, damage already done.
We all do damage.
Character's determined by how we repair it.
Well, J.T. Didn't repair much.
He didn't have a chance.
You do.
I'm fixing what matters!
You know, my old man was right about one thing.
This club has lost its way.
And I thought I was the guy that was gonna change that.
And then I realized that that arrogance that that belief that one man can change it is what drove my old man into the ground.
Defeat is not what killed your father.
I don't want to hear about history.
I'm taking care of what's in front of me.
You and Clay both.
This isn't about Clay.
It's about me.
It's about me figuring out what I gotta do today that keeps me alive tomorrow.
This ain't about the club, Piney.
It's about my family.
I won't tell you how much you just sounded like your old man.
Your father was...
He was the best man I ever knew.
And before you let him die you should find him and know that for yourself.
I go to sleep
I'm with a dream of you
And when I wake up
There'll be no one
'Cause I know love When I feel it
There's no use trying To conceal it
It's good to see you guys.
Yeah.
Rita.
Hey.
Hey.
Good turnout.
Was hoping for more, but yeah.
It's good.
You're Dr. Knowles.
Yes.
Rita Roosevelt.
Hi.
Thank you so much for being part of our committee.
My pleasure.
Uh, so how much have you raised?
Some.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
You, uh...
You didn't know you were part of the committee, did you?
No.
Hey.
Are you okay?
This was a waste of time.
Oh, come on, that's not true.
It was grandiose of me to think I could pull this off.
No, you went with your gut.
You did something because it was right.
Created tension between you and the mayor.
Well, you know, that's my favorite part.
I love getting under that guy's skin.
Mrs. Roosevelt?
Excuse me.
What?
I was hoping I could say a few words to the folks, make a formal donation.
Family friendly.
Promise.
Sure.
Yeah?
It's okay.
That went well.
My wife grew up in this town.
It became my home 31 years ago.
I love Charming.
I know some of you have an opinion about my club.
You think maybe we overstayed our welcome.
But ask yourself this.
What's worse?
A few broken windows, some fighting now and again or bulldozers gutting the heart of your town?
Sons of Anarchy have always stood up for Charming.
We pride ourselves in knowing that we've kept this town tight-knit supported and protected small-business owners.
Charming Heights is the beginning of the end.
Sooner or later, your businesses are gonna end up just like this garden hanging on by a thread, hoping, praying for the charity of others.
Tonight, I offer that charity.
Two checks.
Seventy-five thousand dollars.
Nice.
Nice.
Yeah.
One of those checks is from me, so I know what you're thinking.
Blood money, probably stole it.
It's okay, you can think that.
But the other check comes from a man who believes in this town even more than I do.
A man whose family has pumped lifeblood into this community for almost 50 years.
So, if you can't thank me you should definitely thank him.
The guy who should be mayor.
Elliot Oswald.
Right there.
Yo.
Got two vehicles.
Wait for my signal.
Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
Let's do it, guys.
One of them's leaving.
That's Luis.
Where'd they go?
Check it.
Empty.
No one on the perimeter.
What the hell is this?
Trojan tortilla?
That's gotta be rigged.
This thing will blow us all to hell.
Where's Pedro?
Open it.
Step back.
Back.
Back.
Jesus Christ.
How the hell did they know that we were waiting for them?
Pedro never left our sight.
Yeah.
Looks like the competition's one step ahead.
Send Samtaz the rest of Armando.
Luis is sending more guys.
Be here tomorrow.
Gonna keep Tacoma at the warehouse.
Shit.
This is for Galindo to fix.
We'll get Romeo up here, clean it up.
Good.
Gonna head back to the warehouse with Tacoma.
I won't be able to sleep.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's just a matter of time before it hurts our kids.
I'd never let that happen.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I have to get them out of here.
I know.
I thought I knew what we were getting into.
We're in over our head.
There's a conference up at Providence Hospital in Oregon, day after tomorrow.
They're interested in me.
You should go.
Take Elyda, bring the boys with you.
Just stay there until things calm down here.
Then we'll figure it out.
What about Gemma?
Tell her the truth.
You're protecting our family.
Hey, baby.
Where are you?
Heading home.
You okay?
Yeah.
The thing with the cartel?
Yeah, we're still working it.
Uh, I'm gonna stay at the clubhouse, try to figure some of this shit out.
You want me to come by?
No, I'm in lockdown in the chapel.
I need the quiet.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you too.
You okay?
Yeah.
Take me home, Tiggy.
Oh, shit.
You scared me, man.
Jesus!
What the hell are you doing?
You coward!
Get up.
Come on.
Get up.
Come on.
All right.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Let me tell you About this little girl I know
She got blue eyes And a ways to go
She got a head full Of I don't knows
Either pull the trigger or let me in.
She's a lot like This one-horse town
Give me the nine.
It's like a lost case Of being found
And the boot.
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep rollin' round
I been smoking That old whiskey down
I got a lost case Of being found
There.
You got something to tell me?
Shit went down today, things got complicated with Galindo.
I'm gonna need more time.
More time, more death.
Yeah, I'm trying to do the right thing here.
The right thing for you.
That's all you've ever done at the head of that table.
Lead by greed.
Well, if you hated me so much why'd you sponsor me?
Patch me in?
Because back then, you could be trusted.
Ah...
And so now I'm supposed to trust you?
These, um pointed letters you're supposed to have.
What's to prevent you from showing them even after I kill the cartel deal?
That's a risk you're gonna have to take.
Okay.
I'll call Romeo.
But if there's retaliation, that blood's on your hands.
Well, the broken part of me
And this trouble so hard
And even after I lost you
Where are the letters?
Where did you put them?
They're not here.
Where are they?
I been rollin' and rollin'
Honey, all the night through
Tara still got them?
My God, how would Tara know?
She's the one that gave them to you.
You don't think I knew that, old man?
Just leave her out of it, huh?
Too late.
Well, the wasted part of me
And this trouble so hard
Well, the wasted part of you
Is your half filled-up heart
We been rollin' and rollin'
Honey, all our lives through
Still drunk, still crazy, still blue
I'm still drunk Still crazy
I'm still blue
Previously on Sons of Anarchy:
How's it going with the gardens?
Ah, not so good.
We don't raise another 80,000 in three weeks, it's gone.
Hey, you got a family.
You got a new wife.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Rafi, Pedro, get the crew.
They should be with the Sons.
Track those putos.
I found some of J.T.'s old letters.
John wanted to end the relationship with the Irish, stop the club from selling.
He was killed before that meeting.
Kill the drug muling or I'll let the club read the letters.
The history that Tara and Piney know, very dangerous.
Now, we got to stop this in its tracks.
I was hoping I could walk you to your car... bend your ear a bit.
Have him, uh, pull a sample from the load, couple grams.
If he gets caught, they'll kill him.
That's the point.
Jesus, you took it?
Back at the warehouse.
Let's go.
Here.
I spotted him pulling something out.
He saw me and freaked.
He tried to kill me.
The way you handled this hard thing with Miles, I'm proud of you.
You earned this.
Shit.
What the hell, man?
Where is he?
Juice!
Juicy-boy!
There.
Hey.
Hey.
What the hell you doing'?
Was pissing.
What's all this shit?
Did you take a spill?
What's that?
Oswald, man.
He's got those stupid security chains all over these back roads.
[Me LAUGHS]
You clotheslined one?
Jackass.
Yeah.
We got to go.
What's up?
Vote.
Drugs?
Change of leadership.
Who is it?
Take the gun, stay in the back room.
Go.
Sorry about the hour, Ms. Knowles.
What is it?
We just got a call from your administrator over at St. Thomas.
She's convinced you did receive a death threat.
I didn't take it seriously.
That's why I didn't report it.
Then why did the MC post someone here to watch you?
There's a bike outside.
I'm assuming he's somewhere in the back, armed.
The answer to that question will require a warrant.
Oh, you really got it down, don't you?
I appreciate your concern, sheriff.
It's more than concern, it's my legal obligation.
So I'm gonna post a unit outside, and I'll coordinate with the hospital security.
It's more than just your safety at stake.
But I'm sure you know that.
Sorry to disturb you.
Morning, lads.
He's making chili for my mom.
Charming Gardens potluck thing.
Dude creeps me out.
Accept that.
Piney wasn't gonna proxy this vote.
Wanted a front-row seat.
You talk to him yet?
No.
So what happens if Bobby takes this vote?
Short term, not much he can do.
Pulls us away from Galindo.
Risk is too big.
Long term, maybe Bobby's a better choice.
You thinking of going that way?
Not sure.
You're staying in Clay's camp?
Look, I know it's dirty, bro.
But he's getting us whole.
Eventually, we're less desperate, make smarter choices.
Let's vote this shit.
I'm sorry, son.
I love you, Pop.
I'm with you on this.
Come on, let's go.
All right.
There's a challenge on the table.
New president.
I don't think we need the formalities of nomination.
You want the chair.
I ain't got no choice.
Okay.
Yea or nay.
Bobby taking the gavel.
Nay.
Nay.
Take this.
- Go, go, go!
- Come on.
There's one.
Don't move.
Stay down.
Stay down.
You okay?
Yeah.
Clear this shit out the way.
Check his ink.
Lobo Sonora.
Shit.
This woke up the whole 'hood, man.
Get this asshole to the rez.
Call the gun warehouse.
I'll reach out to Alvarez.
Oh, man.
Clay.
This is bad.
Like, "bad" bad.
What is it?
Holy shit.
That's...
It's Armando.
Riding through this world All alone
God takes your soul You're on your own
The crow ﬂies straight A perfect line
On the devil's path Until you die
Gotta look this life In the eye
You find out what he knows.
Hey.
Come on.
You're with me.
Yeah.
That bag of heads is your "get out of drugs free" card.
What the hell you talking about?
You tell the cartel we didn't sign up for this blood feud, and you want out.
What do you think, I can just bail?
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
And you're gonna do it today, because your time is up.
If we're still in the drug business tomorrow...
I'm delivering those letters to the club.
Hey.
Gun warehouse is safe, but the Mayan truck got jacked.
Full load of coke on the way out to dealers.
Three of Alvarez's guys MIA.
Goddamn it.
These guys are military sharp.
How did Tucson take the news?
They had assumed the worst.
Ah.
Great.
Chocolate rain.
Yo, take this.
Got it.
Go, go.
Hey. where you going?
The cabin.
Come on, Pop.
Stay here.
We need you.
You keep your head down, boy.
Oh, come on.
Okay, lickity-split.
Lickity-split.
Lickity.
We got it handled.
Handled?
They dumped a bag of heads.
I'm living in goddamn Juarez here.
Garden fund-raiser's tonight.
Ain't gonna be any fund-raiser after this.
We can't back out.
We don't know what the hell... we're dealing with here, Mom.
This noise is gonna be all over Charming.
If we hide, looks like we got something to hide from.
Fund-raiser shows Charming the Sons give a shit.
We need that.
Have Phil shadow me.
Take a grenade to get past him.
No.
Tig.
He's the only one I trust to keep you safe.
Shit.
All right, lock it down.
- Let me guess.
You smell smoke?
- No.
Bullets.
And based on all the calls and the looks of the clubhouse...
I'm guessing they were of the automatic variety.
Yeah, we noticed that.
I'm glad you're here.
Feel safer already.
Do you have any idea who it was?
No.
I don't like to point fingers... but, uh, Dezarian Motorworks...
Tenth Street, they've been kind of pissed off at us... since we expanded our custom-bike business.
Disgruntled mechanics?
Mm.
Armenians.
Very unstable people.
Well, I really appreciate your cooperation... but we'll still have to conduct a full investigation.
Knock yourself out.
I really hope this attack doesn't have anything to do... with the threat on Dr. Knowles.
The hospital confirmed it.
Tara and I had another chat this morning.
You know, you have a beautiful family, Jax.
Be really sad to see their daddy catch a bullet.
Yeah.
It would be.
Do you have kids?
No.
You really should.
It's good to have a reason not to die.
Your compound is a crime scene.
Lock it down, and stay the hell out of my way.
- Cane.
- Yeah?
Tara's fine.
I just talked to her.
She's on her way to work.
Rat's with her.
You take care of her.
Always.
Let's get out of here.
Love you.
Hey.
You gotta clear out of here.
This is a crime scene.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Where has all this mess begun?
Making chili for the fund-raiser.
I don't give a shit.
Let's go.
Where has all this mess begun?
Let him make the chili.
Stay in this kitchen, you hear?
Yes, sir.
Hey, turn that music off.
He hasn't said a word.
- You sure you didn't cut out his tongue?
- Not yet.
And I'm running out of ideas.
Galindo.
You told us we didn't have to worry stateside.
Lobo had no northern network.
They don't.
What's our guest saying?
Nada.
He's definitely Lobo.
Ex-military, infantry.
What's that for?
Sodium pentothal.
It'll get him talking.
Hey, Gem.
I'll take that.
Thanks.
Hey, what happened to Chaney?
Heart attack.
Oh.
Who's this?
Clay.
Long story.
Hey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, Gem.
Peace of mind.
Where you land with all this drug stuff?
Oh, I'm backing Clay.
You think he's got it handled?
Much as I can tell.
You know, he doesn't tell that much to me anymore.
I'm stuck mostly doing bitch work.
Literally-No.
No.
Watching you is a pleasure.
He loves you, Tig.
Wouldn't trust anyone else to watch me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't shit on anything, Clay.
That Lobo says there's a rat in your crew with roots in Nogales.
He's a lying puta, ese.
It don't matter Mayan or Son.
That bitch is dead.
That guy is full of shit.
No, he's full of truth serum.
If he says the Lobo's getting intel from a Mayan, he's not lying.
A Mayan with family in Nogales.
Now, who would that be, Marcus?
Pedro.
That Pedro?
Scumbag was in my clubhouse.
That's how they knew where to hit us, where the cut and the bag was.
Hold on.
Hey, hey, hey.
Heh.
Look, if Pedro is the pipeline to Lobo... then let's feed him something useful.
Our guns.
We'll tell them we're moving them out tomorrow... that we're storing them here tonight.
Then you and your guys take them down.
That soldier says there's about 25 Lobos local.
I only have four other men.
I'll need support.
Oh, Jesus.
We're not exactly an infantry unit, bro.
Well, you will be, because make no mistake, gentlemen... we're at war.
Yeah.
Good.
Come on, brother.
You did good.
Yeah.
Alvarez is gonna bait the hook, let Pedro know the guns will be here at 8.
I'm gonna put the prospects on the warehouse, pull Tacoma into this.
- I'm gonna cancel the fund-raiser.
- No, man.
It's good you be there.
Puts us somewhere else if this gets noisy.
I know every thought that's going through your head right now.
But we gotta roll as one into this.
Otherwise, we're all dead.
Yeah, I know.
You'll get your leadership vote.
Let's hope there's someone left standing to lead.
I'm gonna ride out to Mary's, see my kids.
That's good, man.
Where's Piney?
Tequila retreat.
Cabin.
- I'll take a ride out, check in on him.
- Appreciate it.
I'm sorry, man.
I never thought muling would lead to this shit.
I know.
We're in it now, brother.
Got to get it done, move past it.
Yeah.
CSU is there now.
We're putting it together.
I know your wife's been working really hard on this Charming Gardens event.
Well, it's her fund-raiser.
You know, the Sons of Anarchy via Teller-Morrow are all over this thing.
I think it's too dangerous, I want you to cancel it.
That won't be necessary.
Can you promise the violence that happened this morning won't repeat?
The only thing I can promise is that I'll do my job.
I've seen firsthand what happens when the club's business bleeds into this town.
My brother died because of it.
No disrespect for the dead, but how long are you gonna beat that drum?
You're way out of line, lieutenant.
And where are those lines, mayor?
You know, the ones that separate public service from self service?
This isn't about my real estate...
Oh, sure it is!
You can wrap it in any type of "I love Charming" package that you want.
But it still funnels back to your pocket.
Now, I will have adequate protection at the fund-raiser.
Charming will be safe.
I'm going over your head on this.
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
That chili ready yet?
No, it's got to simmer for, like, a long time.
No, it's simmered enough.
Give me two bowls of it.
Hey.
Thought you were in surgery today.
I've been pulled.
Apparently, the hospital feels my presence there is a threat.
Ah, shit.
Am I crazy, Gemma?
Why do I believe him when he says it'll get better?
Because he means it.
No one saw this coming, baby.
I hate this shit too.
I'm trying this his way.
I really am.
I know you are.
So does Jax.
We pull through, and we stick it out.
That's what family does.
Come on.
Let's go check on that chili.
Come on.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's good.
Unique flavor.
Good chili.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Hey, uh, hang on, Gemma.
Hang on.
It's not ready.
Gemma, hey.
Hey.
Did you follow the recipe?
I had to add a few things of my own.
I can see that.
Is it spicy?
Uh, very.
Actually made my eyes burn.
What?
May have gotten in over my head.
Yeah, it's an old family recipe.
It's a delicate process.
I probably should've made it myself.
Uh, why don't you take it up to the reservation?
I think Happy likes it that hot.
Yeah.
I accept that.
Elliot.
Bring me out here to pick flowers?
Something like that.
Town needs 75K to save this place.
So I hear.
You and me are gonna cover it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Charming needs a hero, Elliot.
Hale's backing on Charming Heights is gonna fall apart.
Next time the eminent domain vote comes before city council... it's got to lose.
You promised you wouldn't shit on this.
We sway public opinion against Hale.
He loses the 99 on-ramp, and all that land reverts back to you.
We all win.
Hale will just find another way.
Eh.
Two-year term.
He's already spent a year funneling policy into his own pocket.
These people ain't stupid.
Where you going with this?
I ain't going anywhere.
That's the point.
I know who I am, what I do.
Keeping Charming the way it is, that's what I get out of this.
I got no agenda here.
I just want my town back.
Think about it.
I'll see you later.
Well, well, well.
You on task or is this a, uh, social call?
I'm just checking in.
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I know you and Clay have been going at it over this whole cartel thing.
You don't know anything.
Look, I get it.
You're pissed.
I'm just trying to tell you my side of it.
Do you have a side anymore?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
For ten years, I gave up on this club.
Rode my limit just to keep the patch.
And then you came up.
You reminded me so much of John.
Just...
It felt like maybe our idea still had a chance.
Well, I'm not my old man.
Oh, I'm very clear on that now.
You need to rip him off the pedestal, Piney.
J.T. bailed on all of us.
You trying to tell me you didn't know about Maureen Ashby?
About Trinity?
Maureen was a distraction.
When your brother took a turn for the worse, your dad was right back here.
Yeah, damage already done.
We all do damage.
Character's determined by how we repair it.
Well, J.T. didn't repair much.
He didn't have a chance.
You do.
I'm fixing what matters!
You know, my old man was right about one thing.
This club has lost its way.
And I thought I was the guy that was gonna change that.
And then I realized that that arrogance... that that belief that one man can change it... is what drove my old man into the ground.
Defeat is not what killed your father.
I don't want to hear about history.
I'm taking care of what's in front of me.
You and Clay both.
This isn't about Clay.
It's about me.
It's about me figuring out what I gotta do today... that keeps me alive tomorrow.
This ain't about the club, Piney.
It's about my family.
I won't tell you how much you just sounded like your old man.
Your father was...
He was the best man I ever knew.
And before you let him die... you should find him... and know that for yourself.
I go to sleep
I'm with a dream of you
And when I wake up
There 'II be no one
'Cause I know love When I feel it
There's no use trying To conceal it
It's good to see you guys.
Yeah.
- Rita.
- Hey.
Hey.
Good turnout.
Was hoping for more, but yeah.
It's good.
You're Dr. Knowles.
Yes.
Rita Roosevelt.
H I.
Thank you so much for being part of our committee.
My pleasure.
Uh, so how much have you raised?
Some.
Excuse me.
It was nice meeting you.
You, uh...
You didn't know you were part of the committee, did you?
No.
Hey.
Are you okay?
This was a waste of time.
Oh, come on, that's not true.
It was grandiose of me to think I could pull this off.
No, you went with your gut.
You did something because it was right.
Created tension between you and the mayor.
Well, you know, that's my favorite part.
I love getting under that guy's skin.
Mrs. Roosevelt?
Excuse me.
What?
I was hoping I could say a few words... to the folks, make a formal donation.
Family friendly.
Promise.
Sure.
Yeah?
It's okay.
That went well.
My wife grew up in this town.
It became my home 31 years ago.
I love Charming.
I know some of you have an opinion about my club.
You think maybe we overstayed our welcome.
But ask yourself this.
What's worse?
A few broken windows, some fighting now and again... or bulldozers gutting the heart of your town?
Sons of Anarchy have always stood up for Charming.
We pride ourselves in knowing that we've kept this town tight-knit... supported and protected small-business owners.
Charming Heights is the beginning of the end.
Sooner or later, your businesses are gonna end up just like this garden... hanging on by a thread, hoping, praying for the charity of others.
Tonight, I offer that charity.
Two checks.
Seventy-five thousand dollars.
- Nice.
Nice.
- Yeah.
One of those checks is from me, so I know what you're thinking.
Blood money, probably stole it.
It's okay, you can think that.
But the other check comes from a man... who believes in this town even more than I do.
A man whose family has pumped lifeblood... into this community for almost 50 years.
So, if you can't thank me... you should definitely thank him.
The guy who should be mayor.
Elliot Oswald.
Right there.
Yo.
Got two vehicles.
Wait for my signal.
Hey.
He)'...
Come on.
Let's do it, guys.
One of them's leaving.
That's Luis.
Where'd they go?
Check it.
Empty.
No one on the perimeter.
What the hell is this?
- Trojan tortilla?
- That's gotta be rigged.
This thing will blow us all to hell.
Where's Pedro?
Open it.
Step back.
Back.
Back.
Jesus Christ.
How the hell did they know that we were waiting for them?
Pedro never left our sight.
Yeah.
Looks like the competition's one step ahead.
Send Samtaz the rest of Armando.
Luis is sending more guys.
Be here tomorrow.
Gonna keep Tacoma at the warehouse.
Shit.
This is for Galindo to fix.
We'll get Romeo up here, clean it up.
Good.
Gonna head back to the warehouse with Tacoma.
I won't be able to sleep.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's just a matter of time before it hurts our kids.
I'd never let that happen.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I have to get them out of here.
I know.
I thought I knew what we were getting into.
We're in over our head.
There's a... conference up at Providence Hospital in Oregon, day after tomorrow.
They're interested in me.
You should go.
Take Elyda, bring the boys with you.
Just stay there until things calm down here.
Then we'll figure it out.
What about Gemma?
Tell her the truth.
You're protecting our family.
Hey, baby.
Where are you?
Heading home.
You okay?
Yeah.
The thing with the cartel?
Yeah, we're still working it.
Uh, I'm gonna stay at the clubhouse, try to figure some of this shit out.
You want me to come by?
No, I'm in lockdown in the chapel.
I need the quiet.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you too.
You okay?
Yeah.
Take me home, Tiggy.
Oh, shit.
You scared me, man.
Jesus!
What the hell are you doing?
You coward!
Get up.
Come on.
Get up.
Come on.
All right.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Let me tell you About this little girl I know
She got blue eyes And a ways to go
She got a head full Of I don't knows
Either pull the trigger or let me in.
She's a lot like This one-horse town
Give me the nine.
It's like a lost case Of being found
And the boot.
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep rollin' round
I been smoking That old whiskey down
I got a lost case Of being found
There.
You got something to tell me?
Shit went down today, things got complicated with Galindo.
I'm gonna need more time.
More time, more death.
Yeah, I'm trying to do the right thing here.
The right thing for you.
That's all you've ever done at the head of that table.
Lead by greed.
Well, if you hated me so much... why'd you sponsor me?
Patch me in?
Because back then, you could be trusted.
Ah...
And so now I'm supposed to trust you?
These, um... pointed letters you're supposed to have.
What's to prevent you from showing them even after I kill the cartel deal?
That's a risk you're gonna have to take.
Okay.
I'll call Romeo.
But if there's retaliation, that blood's on your hands.
Well, the broken part of me
And this trouble so hard
And even after I lost you
Where are the letters?
Where did you put them?
They're not here.
Where are they?
I been rollin' and rollin'
Honey, all the night through
Tara still got them?
My God, how would Tara know?
She's the one that gave them to you.
You don't think I knew that, old man?
Just leave her out of it, huh?
Too late.
Well, the wasted part of me
And this trouble so hard
Well, the wasted part of you ls your half filled-up heart
We been rollin' and rollin'
Honey, all our lives through
Still drunk, still crazy, still blue
I'm still drunk Still crazy
I'm still blue
Previously on Sons of Anarchy...
How's it going with the gardens?
Not so good.
We don't raise another 80,000 in the next three weeks, it's gone.
Hey, you got a family.
You got a new wife.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Rafi, Pedro, get the crew.
They should be with the Sons to track those putos.
I found some of JT's old letters.
John wanted to end the relationship with the Irish, stop the club from selling guns.
He was killed before that meeting happened.
Kill the drug muling or I'll let the rest of the club read the letters.
The history that Tara and Piney know-- very dangerous.
Now, we got to stop this in its tracks.
I was hoping I could walk you to your car, bend your ear a bit.
Have him pull a sample from the load-- couple grams.
If he gets caught, they'll kill him.
That's the point.
Jesus, you took it?
Back at the warehouse.
Let's go.
Here.
I spotted him pulling something out of the leaves.
He saw me and he freaked out.
He tried to kill me.
The way you handled this hard thing with Miles, I'm proud of you.
You earned this.
Shit.
Shit!
What the hell, man?
Where is he?
Juice!
Juicy-boy!
There.
-
- Hey.
-
- Hey.
What the hell you doing?
Was pissing.
What's all this shit, huh?
Did you take a spill?
What's that?
Oswald, man.
He's got those stupid security chains all over these back roads.
You clotheslined one?
Jackass.
Yeah.
We got to go.
What's up?
Vote.
-
- Drugs?
-
- Change of leadership.
Who is it?
Take the gun, stay in the back room.
Go.
Sorry about the hour, Ms. Knowles.
What is it?
We just got a call from your administrator over at St. Thomas.
She's convinced you did receive a death threat.
I didn't take it seriously.
That's why I didn't report it.
Then why did the MC post someone here to watch you?
There's a bike outside.
I'm assuming he's somewhere in the back-- armed.
The answer to that question will require a warrant.
Oh, you really got it down, don't you?
I appreciate your concern, Sheriff.
Well, it's more than concern, it's my legal obligation.
So I'm gonna post a unit outside, and I'll coordinate with the hospital security.
It's more than just your safety at stake.
But I'm sure you know that.
Sorry to disturb you.
Piney wasn't gonna proxy this vote.
Wanted a front row seat.
You talk to him yet?
No.
So what happens if Bobby takes this vote?
Short term, not much he can do.
Pulls us away from Galindo.
Risk is too big.
Long term, maybe Bobby's a better choice.
You thinking of going that way?
Not sure.
You're staying in Clay's camp?
Look, I know it's dirty, bro.
But he's getting us whole.
Eventually, we're less desperate, make smarter choices.
Let's vote this shit.
I'm sorry, son.
I love you, Pop.
I'm with you on this.
Come on, let's go.
All right.
There's a challenge on the table.
New president.
I don't think we need the formalities of nomination.
You want the chair.
I ain't got no choice.
Okay.
Yea or nay.
Bobby taking the gavel.
Nay.
Nay.
- Go, go, go!
- Come on!
Don't move.
Stay down.
Stay down.
You okay?
Yeah.
Clear this shit out the way.
- Check his ink.
-
- Lobo Sonora!
-
- Be careful.
-
- Shit!
This woke up the whole hood, man.
Get this asshole to the rez.
Call the gun warehouse, put them on alert.
I'll reach out to Alvarez.
Oh, man.
Clay!
This is bad!
Like, bad bad!
What is that?
Holy shit.
- That's...
-
- It's Armando.

Hey.
Come on.
You're with me.
Yeah.
That bag of heads is your "Get out of drugs free" card.
What the hell you talking about?
You tell the cartel we didn't sign up for this blood feud, and you want out.
What do you think, I can just bail in the middle of this shit?
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
And you're gonna do it today, 'cause your time is up.
If we're still in the drug business tomorrow,
I'm delivering those letters to the club.
Hey.
Gun warehouse is safe, but the Mayan tortilla truck got jacked.
Full load of coke on the way out to dealers.
Three of Alvarez's guys MIA.
Goddamn it.
These guys are military sharp.
How did Tucson take the news?
They had assumed the worst.
Oh.
Great.
Chocolate rain.
-
- No, you take this.
- Got it.
Go, go.
Hey.
Where you going?
The cabin.
Come on, Pop.
Stay here.
We need you.
You keep your head down, boy.
Oh, come on.
Okay.
We got it handled.
Handled?
They dumped a bag of heads.
I'm living in goddamn Juarez here.
Garden fund-raiser's tonight.
Ain't gonna be any fund-raiser after this.
We can't back out.
We don't know what the hell we're dealing with here, Mom.
This noise is gonna be all over Charming.
If we hide, looks like we got something to hide from.
Fund-raiser shows Charming the Sons give a shit.
We need that.
Have Phil shadow me.
Take a grenade to get past him.
No.
Tig.
He's the only one I trust to keep you safe.
Shit.
All right.
Lock it down!
Let me guess.
You smell smoke?
No.
Bullets.
And based on all the calls and the looks of the clubhouse,
I'm guessing they were of the automatic variety.
Yeah, we noticed that.
Glad you're here.
Feel safer already.
You have any idea who it was?
Nope.
I don't like to point fingers, but, uh, Dezarian
Motorworks, Tenth Street-- they've been kind of pissed off at us since we expanded our custom bike business.
Disgruntled mechanics?
-
- Mm.
-
- Armenians.
Very unstable people.
Well, I really appreciate your cooperation, but we'll still have to conduct a full investigation.
Knock yourself out.
You know, I really hope this attack doesn't have anything to do with the threat on Dr. Knowles.
The hospital confirmed it.
Tara and I had another chat this morning.
You know, you have a beautiful family, Jax.
Be really sad to see their daddy catch a bullet.
Yeah.
It would be.
You have kids?
No.
You really should.
It's good to have a reason not to die.
Your compound is a crime scene.
Lock it down, and stay the hell out of my way.
Okay, okay.
Tara's fine.
I just talked to her.
She's on her way to work.
Rat's with her.
Take care of her.
Always.
Let's get out of here.
Love you.
Hey.
You got to clear out here.
This is a crime scene.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Making chili for the fund-raiser.
I don't give a shit.
Let's go.
Let him make the chili.
Stay in this kitchen, you hear?
Yes, sir.
Hey.
Turn that music off.
He hasn't said a word.
You sure you didn't cut out his tongue?
Not yet.
And I'm running out of ideas.
Galindo.
Now it's time to pray, you bastard.
You told us we didn't have to worry stateside,
Lobo had no northern networks.
They don't.
What's our guest saying?
Nothing.
He's definitely Lobo.
Ex-military, infantry.
What's that for?
Sodium pentothal.
Time to get him talking.
Pedro, take him to the back.
That Lobo says there's a rat in your crew with roots in Nogales.
He's a lying bitch, this one.
It don't matter Mayan or Son.
That bitch is dead.
That guy is full of shit, man.
No, he's full of truth serum, and if he says the Lobo's getting intel from a Mayan, then he's not lying.
A Mayan with family in Nogales.
Now, who would that be, Marcus?
Pedro.
That Pedro?
Scumbag was in my clubhouse.
That's how they knew where to hit us, where the cut and the bag was.
I'm gonna rip off his heart.
Motherfucker...
Bastard.
- Hey, hey.
- Don't touch him..
Look, if Pedro is the pipeline to Lobo, then let's feed him something useful.
Our guns.
We'll tell 'em we're moving them out of Cali tomorrow, that we're storing them here tonight.
Then you and your guys take 'em down.
That soldier says there's about 25 Lobos local.
I only have four other men with me.
I'll need support.
Oh, Jesus.
We're not exactly an infantry unit, bro.
Well, you will be, because make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're at war.
Yeah.
Good.
Come on, brother.
Alvarez is gonna bait the hook-- let Pedro know the guns will be here at 8:00.
All right, I'm gonna put the prospects on the warehouse, pull Tacoma into this.
I'm gonna cancel the fund-raiser.
No, man.
It's good you be there.
Puts us somewhere else if this gets noisy.
I know every thought that's going through your head right now.
But we got to roll as one into this.
Otherwise, we're all dead.
Yeah, I know.
You'll get your leadership vote.
Let's hope there's someone left standing to lead.
I'm gonna ride out to Mary's, see my kids.
That's good, man.
Where's Piney?
Tequila retreat.
Cabin.
I'll take a ride out, check in on him.
Appreciate it.
I'm sorry, man.
I never thought muling would lead to this shit.
I know.
We're in it now, brother.
Got to get it done, move past it.
Yeah.
Hey?
That chili ready yet?
No.
It's got to simmer for, like, a long time.
No, it's simmered enough.
Give me two bowls of it.
Hey.
Thought you were in surgery today.
I've been pulled.
Apparently, the hospital feels my presence there is a threat.
Ah, shit.
Am I crazy, Gemma?
Why do I believe him when he says it'll get better?
'Cause he means it.
No one saw this coming, baby.
I hate this shit, too.
I'm trying this his way.
I really am.
I know you are.
So does Jax.
We pull through, and we stick it out.
That's what family does.
Come on.
Let's go check on my chili.
Come on.
- What do you think, guys, good?
- Yeah, it's good.
I'll be...
I'll be right back.
Hey, uh, hang on.
Gemma, hang on.
It's not ready.
Gemma!
Hey!
Hey.
Did you follow the recipe?
I had to add a few things of my own.
I can see that.
Is it spicy?
Uh, very.
Actually made my eyes burn.
Oh.
May have gotten in over my head.
Yeah, well, you know, it's an old family recipe.
It's a delicate process.
I probably should've made it myself.
Uh, why don't you take it up to the reservation.
I think Happy likes it that hot.
Yeah.
I accept that.
Elliott.
Bring me out here to pick flowers?
Something like that.
Town needs 75K to save this place.
So I hear.
You and me are gonna cover it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Charming needs a hero, Elliott.
Hale's backing on Charming Heights is gonna fall apart.
Next time the eminent domain vote comes before city council, it's got to lose.
You promised me you wouldn't shit on this, Clay.
We sway public opinion against Hale.
He loses the 99 on-ramp, and all that land reverts back to you.
We all win.
Hale will just find another way.
Eh.
Two-year term.
He's already spent a year funneling policy into his own pocket.
These people ain't stupid.
Where you going with this?
I ain't going anywhere.
That's the point.
I know who I am, what I do.
Keeping Charming the way it is, that's what I get out of this.
I got no agenda here.
I just want my town back.
Think about it.
I'll see you later.
Well, well, well.
You on task or is this a, uh, social call?
I'm just checking in.
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I know you and Clay have been going at it over this whole cartel thing.
You don't know anything.
Look, I get it.
You're pissed.
I'm just trying to tell you my side of it.
Do you have a side anymore?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
For ten years, I gave up on this club.
Rode my limit just to keep the patch.
And then you came up.
You reminded me so much of John.
Just...
It felt like maybe our idea still had a chance.
Well, I'm not my old man.
Oh, I'm very clear on that now.
You need to rip him off the pedestal, Piney.
JT bailed on all of us.
You trying to tell me you didn't know about Maureen Ashby?
About Trinity?
Maureen was a distraction.
But when your brother took a turn for the worse, your dad was right back here.
Yeah, damage already done.
We all do damage.
Character's determined by how we repair it.
Well, JT didn't repair much.
He didn't have a chance.
You do!
I'm fixing what matters!
You know, my old man was right about one thing.
This club has lost its way.
And I thought I was the guy that was gonna change that.
And then I realized that that arrogance, that that belief that one man can change it, is what drove my old man into the ground.
Defeat is not what killed your father!
I don't want to hear about history!
I'm taking care of what's in front of me.
You and Clay both.
This isn't about Clay.
It's about me.
It's about me figuring out what I got to do today that keeps me alive tomorrow.
This ain't about the club, Piney.
It's about my family.
I won't tell you how much you just sounded like your old man.
Your father was...
He was the best man I ever knew.
And before you let him die, you should find him... and know that for yourself.

TIG:
What the hell, man?
CHIBS:
Where is he?
Juice!
Juicy-boy!
There.
JUICE:
- Hey.
TIG:
- Hey.
What the hell you doing?
JUICE:
Was pissing.
CHIBS:
What's all this shit, huh?
Did you take a spill?
What's that?
JUICE:
Oswald, man.
He's got those stupid security chains all over these back roads.
(laughs)
TIG:
You clotheslined one?
Jackass.
JUICE:
Yeah.
CHIBS:
We got to go.
JUICE:
What's up?
CHIBS:
Vote.
JUICE:
- Drugs?
TIG:
- Change of leadership.
(knocking)
(knocking)
TARA:
Who is it?
Take the gun, stay in the back room.
Go.
ROOSEVELT:
Sorry about the hour, Ms. Knowles.
TARA:
What is it?
ROOSEVELT:
We just got a call from your administrator over at St. Thomas.
She's convinced you did receive a death threat.
TARA:
I didn't take it seriously.
That's why I didn't report it.
ROOSEVELT:
Then why did the MC post someone here to watch you?
There's a bike outside.
I'm assuming he's somewhere in the back-- armed.
TARA:
The answer to that question will require a warrant.
ROOSEVELT:
Oh, you really got it down, don't you?
TARA:
I appreciate your concern, Sheriff.
ROOSEVELT:
Well, it's more than concern, it's my legal obligation.
So I'm gonna post a unit outside, and I'll coordinate with the hospital security.
(baby cooing)
It's more than just your safety at stake.
But I'm sure you know that.
Sorry to disturb you.
(door opens, closes)
JAX:
Piney wasn't gonna proxy this vote.
OPIE:
Wanted a front row seat.
JAX:
You talk to him yet?
OPIE:
No.
So what happens if Bobby takes this vote?
JAX:
Short term, not much he can do.
Pulls us away from Galindo.
Risk is too big.
OPIE:
Long term, maybe Bobby's a better choice.
JAX:
You thinking of going that way?
OPIE:
Not sure.
You're staying in Clay's camp?
JAX:
Look, I know it's dirty, bro.
But he's getting us whole.
Eventually, we're less desperate, make smarter choices.
CLAY:
Let's vote this shit.
PINEY:
I'm sorry, son.
OPIE:
I love you, Pop.
I'm with you on this.
PINEY:
Come on, let's go.
CLAY:
All right.
There's a challenge on the table.
New president.
I don't think we need the formalities of nomination.
You want the chair.
BOBBY:
I ain't got no choice.
CLAY:
Okay.
Yea or nay.
Bobby taking the gavel.
Nay.
TIG:
Nay.
(automatic gunfire)
(tires screeching)
- Go, go, go!
- Come on!
TIG:
Don't move.
Stay down.
Stay down.
JAX:
You okay?
PHIL:
Yeah.
JAX:
Clear this shit out the way.
- Check his ink.
TIG:
- Lobo Sonora!
HAPPY:
- Be careful.
CLAY:
- Shit!
JAX:
This woke up the whole hood, man.
CLAY:
Get this asshole to the rez.
Call the gun warehouse, put them on alert.
TIG:
I'll reach out to Alvarez.
CHUCK:
Oh, man.
Clay!
This is bad!
Like, bad bad!
What is that?
JUICE:
Holy shit.
- That's...
PINEY:
- It's Armando.

CHIBS:
Hey.
Come on.
You're with me.
JUICE:
Yeah.
(engine starts)
PINEY:
That bag of heads is your "Get out of drugs free" card.
CLAY:
What the hell you talking about?
PINEY:
You tell the cartel we didn't sign up for this blood feud, and you want out.
CLAY:
What do you think, I can just bail in the middle of this shit?
PINEY:
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
And you're gonna do it today, 'cause your time is up.
If we're still in the drug business tomorrow,
I'm delivering those letters to the club.
JAX:
Hey.
Gun warehouse is safe, but the Mayan tortilla truck got jacked.
Full load of coke on the way out to dealers.
Three of Alvarez's guys MIA.
CLAY:
Goddamn it.
TIG:
These guys are military sharp.
CLAY:
How did Tucson take the news?
BOBBY:
They had assumed the worst.
(sirens approaching)
CLAY:
Oh.
Great.
Chocolate rain.
(motorcycle engine starting)
JAX:
- No, you take this.
- Got it.
Go, go.
Hey.
Where you going?
PINEY:
The cabin.
OPIE:
Come on, Pop.
Stay here.
We need you.
PINEY:
You keep your head down, boy.
(engine starts and revs)
CHUCK:
Oh, come on.
(siren sounding)
Okay.
CLAY:
We got it handled.
GEMMA:
Handled?
They dumped a bag of heads.
I'm living in goddamn Juarez here.
(Gemma sighs)
Garden fund-raiser's tonight.
JAX:
Ain't gonna be any fund-raiser after this.
GEMMA:
We can't back out.
JAX:
We don't know what the hell we're dealing with here, Mom.
GEMMA:
This noise is gonna be all over Charming.
If we hide, looks like we got something to hide from.
CLAY:
Fund-raiser shows Charming the Sons give a shit.
We need that.
GEMMA:
Have Phil shadow me.
Take a grenade to get past him.
CLAY:
No.
Tig.
He's the only one I trust to keep you safe.
JAX:
Shit.
ROOSEVELT:
All right.
Lock it down!
JAX:
Let me guess.
You smell smoke?
ROOSEVELT:
No.
Bullets.
And based on all the calls and the looks of the clubhouse,
I'm guessing they were of the automatic variety.
JAX:
Yeah, we noticed that.
Glad you're here.
Feel safer already.
ROOSEVELT:
You have any idea who it was?
CLAY:
Nope.
GEMMA:
I don't like to point fingers, but, uh, Dezarian
Motorworks, Tenth Street-- they've been kind of pissed off at us since we expanded our custom bike business.
ROOSEVELT:
Disgruntled mechanics?
JAX:
- Mm.
GEMMA:
- Armenians.
Very unstable people.
ROOSEVELT:
Well, I really appreciate your cooperation, but we'll still have to conduct a full investigation.
JAX:
Knock yourself out.
ROOSEVELT:
You know, I really hope this attack doesn't have anything to do with the threat on Dr. Knowles.
The hospital confirmed it.
Tara and I had another chat this morning.
You know, you have a beautiful family, Jax.
Be really sad to see their daddy catch a bullet.
JAX:
Yeah.
It would be.
You have kids?
ROOSEVELT:
No.
JAX:
You really should.
It's good to have a reason not to die.
ROOSEVELT:
Your compound is a crime scene.
Lock it down, and stay the hell out of my way.
Okay, okay.
GEMMA:
Tara's fine.
I just talked to her.
She's on her way to work.
Rat's with her.
CLAY:
Take care of her.
TIG:
Always.
JAX:
Let's get out of here.
CLAY:
Love you.
(rock music playing)
CANE:
Hey.
You got to clear out here.
This is a crime scene.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
CHUCK:
Making chili for the fund-raiser.
CANE:
I don't give a shit.
Let's go.
ROOSEVELT:
Let him make the chili.
Stay in this kitchen, you hear?
CHUCK:
Yes, sir.
ROOSEVELT:
Hey.
Turn that music off.
HAPPY:
He hasn't said a word.
JAX:
You sure you didn't cut out his tongue?
HAPPY:
Not yet.
And I'm running out of ideas.
(vehicle approaching)
RAFI:
Galindo.
Now it's time to pray, you bastard.
CLAY:
You told us we didn't have to worry stateside,
Lobo had no northern networks.
LUIS:
They don't.
What's our guest saying?
CHIBS:
Nothing.
LUIS:
He's definitely Lobo.
Ex-military, infantry.
HAPPY:
What's that for?
LUIS:
Sodium pentothal.
Time to get him talking.
Pedro, take him to the back.
LUIS:
That Lobo says there's a rat in your crew with roots in Nogales.
ALVAREZ:
He's a lying bitch, this one.
JAX:
It don't matter Mayan or Son.
That bitch is dead.
ALVAREZ:
That guy is full of shit, man.
LUIS:
No, he's full of truth serum, and if he says the Lobo's getting intel from a Mayan, then he's not lying.
CLAY:
A Mayan with family in Nogales.
Now, who would that be, Marcus?
ALVAREZ:
Pedro.
JAX:
That Pedro?
Scumbag was in my clubhouse.
OPIE:
That's how they knew where to hit us, where the cut and the bag was.
I'm gonna rip off his heart.
Motherfucker...
Bastard.
- Hey, hey.
- Don't touch him..
JAX:
Look, if Pedro is the pipeline to Lobo, then let's feed him something useful.
Our guns.
We'll tell 'em we're moving them out of Cali tomorrow, that we're storing them here tonight.
Then you and your guys take 'em down.
LUIS:
That soldier says there's about 25 Lobos local.
I only have four other men with me.
I'll need support.
BOBBY:
Oh, Jesus.
JAX:
We're not exactly an infantry unit, bro.
LUIS:
Well, you will be, because make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're at war.
(indistinct chatter)
Yeah.
Good.
Come on, brother.
CLAY:
Alvarez is gonna bait the hook-- let Pedro know the guns will be here at 8:00.
JAX:
All right, I'm gonna put the prospects on the warehouse, pull Tacoma into this.
CLAY:
I'm gonna cancel the fund-raiser.
JAX:
No, man.
It's good you be there.
Puts us somewhere else if this gets noisy.
(Clay sighs)
CLAY:
I know every thought that's going through your head right now.
But we got to roll as one into this.
Otherwise, we're all dead.
BOBBY:
Yeah, I know.
CLAY:
You'll get your leadership vote.
BOBBY:
Let's hope there's someone left standing to lead.
(sighing)
OPIE:
I'm gonna ride out to Mary's, see my kids.
JAX:
That's good, man.
Where's Piney?
OPIE:
Tequila retreat.
Cabin.
JAX:
I'll take a ride out, check in on him.
OPIE:
Appreciate it.
JAX:
I'm sorry, man.
I never thought muling would lead to this shit.
OPIE:
I know.
We're in it now, brother.
Got to get it done, move past it.
JAX:
Yeah.
CANE:
Hey?
That chili ready yet?
CHUCK:
No.
It's got to simmer for, like, a long time.
CANE:
No, it's simmered enough.
Give me two bowls of it.
(motorcycles approaching)
GEMMA:
Hey.
Thought you were in surgery today.
TARA:
I've been pulled.
Apparently, the hospital feels my presence there is a threat.
GEMMA:
Ah, shit.
(sighs)
TARA:
Am I crazy, Gemma?
Why do I believe him when he says it'll get better?
GEMMA: 'Cause he means it.
No one saw this coming, baby.
I hate this shit, too.
TARA:
I'm trying this his way.
I really am.
GEMMA:
I know you are.
So does Jax.
We pull through, and we stick it out.
That's what family does.
Come on.
Let's go check on my chili.
Come on.
- What do you think, guys, good?
- Yeah, it's good.
I'll be...
I'll be right back.
Hey, uh, hang on.
Gemma, hang on.
It's not ready.
Gemma!
Hey!
GEMMA:
Hey.
Did you follow the recipe?
CHUCK:
I had to add a few things of my own.
GEMMA:
I can see that.
TARA:
Is it spicy?
GEMMA:
Uh, very.
Actually made my eyes burn.
TARA:
Oh.
CHUCK:
May have gotten in over my head.
GEMMA:
Yeah, well, you know, it's an old family recipe.
It's a delicate process.
I probably should've made it myself.
Uh, why don't you take it up to the reservation.
I think Happy likes it that hot.
Yeah.
CHUCK:
I accept that.
CLAY:
Elliott.
OSWALD:
Bring me out here to pick flowers?
(laughs)
CLAY:
Something like that.
Town needs 75K to save this place.
OSWALD:
So I hear.
CLAY:
You and me are gonna cover it.
OSWALD:
What the hell are you talking about?
CLAY:
Charming needs a hero, Elliott.
Hale's backing on Charming Heights is gonna fall apart.
Next time the eminent domain vote comes before city council, it's got to lose.
OSWALD:
You promised me you wouldn't shit on this, Clay.
CLAY:
We sway public opinion against Hale.
He loses the 99 on-ramp, and all that land reverts back to you.
We all win.
OSWALD:
Hale will just find another way.
CLAY:
Eh.
Two-year term.
He's already spent a year funneling policy into his own pocket.
These people ain't stupid.
OSWALD:
Where you going with this?
CLAY:
I ain't going anywhere.
That's the point.
I know who I am, what I do.
Keeping Charming the way it is, that's what I get out of this.
I got no agenda here.
I just want my town back.
Think about it.
I'll see you later.
PINEY:
Well, well, well.
You on task or is this a, uh, social call?
JAX:
I'm just checking in.
PINEY:
I'm fine.
JAX:
Yeah?
PINEY:
Yeah.
JAX:
I know you and Clay have been going at it over this whole cartel thing.
PINEY:
You don't know anything.
(door opens)
(sighs)
JAX:
Look, I get it.
You're pissed.
I'm just trying to tell you my side of it.
PINEY:
Do you have a side anymore?
JAX:
Okay.
I'm sorry.
PINEY:
For ten years, I gave up on this club.
Rode my limit just to keep the patch.
And then you came up.
You reminded me so much of John.
Just...
It felt like maybe our idea still had a chance.
JAX:
Well, I'm not my old man.
PINEY:
Oh, I'm very clear on that now.
JAX:
You need to rip him off the pedestal, Piney.
JT bailed on all of us.
You trying to tell me you didn't know about Maureen Ashby?
About Trinity?
PINEY:
Maureen was a distraction.
But when your brother took a turn for the worse, your dad was right back here.
JAX:
Yeah, damage already done.
PINEY:
We all do damage.
Character's determined by how we repair it.
JAX:
Well, JT didn't repair much.
PINEY:
He didn't have a chance.
You do!
JAX:
I'm fixing what matters!
You know, my old man was right about one thing.
This club has lost its way.
And I thought I was the guy that was gonna change that.
And then I realized that that arrogance, that that belief that one man can change it, is what drove my old man into the ground.
PINEY:
Defeat is not what killed your father!
JAX:
I don't want to hear about history!
I'm taking care of what's in front of me.
PINEY:
You and Clay both.
JAX:
This isn't about Clay.
It's about me.
It's about me figuring out what I got to do today that keeps me alive tomorrow.
This ain't about the club, Piney.
It's about my family.
(Piney chuckles)
PINEY:
I won't tell you how much you just sounded like your old man.
Your father was...
He was the best man I ever knew.
And before you let him die, you should find him... and know that for yourself.

ROOSEVELT:
Hey.
Are you okay?
RITA:
This was a waste of time.
ROOSEVELT:
Oh, come on, that's not true.
RITA:
No, it was grandiose of me to think that I could pull this off.
ROOSEVELT:
No, you went with your gut.
You mething because you knew it was right.
RITA:
And created tension between you and the mayor.
ROOSEVELT:
Well, you know, that's my favorite part.
I love getting under that guy's skin.
CLAY:
Mrs. Roosevelt.
Excuse me.
ROOSEVELT:
What?
CLAY:
Uh, I was hoping I could say a few words to the folks, make a formal donation.
Family friendly.
Promise.
RITA:
- Sure.
ROOSEVELT:
- Yeah?
RITA:
It's okay.
GEMMA:
That went well.
Cállate, Pedro.
CLAY:
My wife grew up in this town.
It became my home 31 years ago.
I love Charming.
I know some of you have an opinion about my club.
You think maybe we overstayed our welcome.
But ask yourself this.
What's worse?
A few broken windows, some fighting now and again, or bulldozers gutting the heart of your town?
Sons of Anarchy have always stood up for Charming.
We pride ourselves in knowing that we've kept this town tight-knit.
Supported and protected small business owners.
Charming Heights is the beginning of the end.
Sooner or later, your businesses are gonna end up just like this garden-- hanging on by a thread, hoping, praying for the charity of others.
Tonight, I offer that charity.
Two checks.
$75,000.
(cheering, applause)
Nice.
Nice.
CLAY:
One of those checks is from me, so I know what you're thinking.
Blood money, probably stole it.
It's okay, you can think that.
But the other check comes from a man who believes in this town even more than I do.
A man whose family has pumped lifeblood into this community for almost 50 years.
So, if you can't thank me, you should definitely thank him.
The guy who should be mayor.
Elliott Oswald.
(cheering, applause)
(vehicles approaching)
(quiet murmuring)
OPIE:
Got two vehicles.
TORRES:
Wait for my signal.
Conmigo.
CHIBS:
Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
JAX:
One of them's leaving.
That's Luis.
- Where'd they go?
- Check it.
Empty.
LUIS:
No one on the perimeter.
What the hell is this?
BOBBY:
Trojan tortilla?
CHIBS:
That's got to be rigged.
This thing will blow us all to hell.
JAX:
Where's Pedro?
ALVAREZ:
Open it.
JAX:
Step back.
BOBBY:
Back.
Back!
C'mon rat.
Come here.
Stay here.
BOBBY:
Jesus Christ.
OPIE:
How the hell did they know that we were waiting for 'em?
ALVAREZ:
Pedro never left our sight.
JAX:
Yeah.
Looks like the competition's one step ahead.
(grunts, groaning)
(groaning)
(crickets chirping)
JAX:
Sent Samtaz the rest of Armando.
Luis is sending more guys.
Be here tomorrow.
Gonna keep Tacoma at the warehouse.
CLAY:
Shit.
BOBBY:
This is on Galindo to fix.
ALVAREZ:
We'll get Romeo up here, clean it up.
BOBBY:
Good.
JUICE:
Gonna head back to the warehouse with Tacoma.
I won't be able to sleep.
CHIBS:
Yeah.
Okay.
(motorcycle engines starting)
(door creaks open)
(Jax sighs)
TARA:
It's just a matter of time before it hurts our kids.
JAX:
I'd never let that happen.
TARA:
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I have to get them out of here.
JAX:
I know.
I thought I knew what we were getting into.
We're in over our head.
TARA:
There's a... conference up at Providence Hospital in Oregon, day after tomorrow.
They're interested in me.
JAX:
You should go.
Take Elyda, bring the boys with you.
Just stay there until things calm down here.
Then we'll figure it all out.
(Tara sighs)
TARA:
What about Gemma?
JAX:
Tell her the truth.
You're protecting our family.
(phone ringing)
GEMMA:
Hey, baby.
Where are you?
GEMMA:
Heading home.
You okay?
CLAY:
Yeah.
GEMMA:
The thing with the cartel?
CLAY:
Yeah, we're still working it.
Uh, I'm gonna stay at the clubhouse, try to figure some of this shit out.
GEMMA:
You want me to come by?
CLAY:
Nah.
I'm in lockdown in the chapel.
I need the quiet.
GEMMA:
Okay.
CLAY:
Love you.
GEMMA:
Love you, too.
TIG:
You okay?
GEMMA:
Yeah.
(inhales sharply)
Take me home, Tiggy.
(grunts)
JUICE:
Oh, shit.
(Juice sighs) You scared me, man.
(chain clinking)
CHIBS:
Jesus!
What the hell were you doing?
You coward!
(Juice sobbing)
CHIBS:
Get up.
Come on.
Get up.
(Juice crying)
Come on, boy.
Come on.
(knocking)
CLAY:
Either pull the trigger, or let me in.
PINEY:
Give me the nine.
And the boot.
You have something to tell me?
CLAY:
Shit went down today, things got complicated with Galindo.
I'm gonna need more time.
PINEY:
More time, more death.
CLAY:
Yeah, I'm trying to do the right thing here.
PINEY:
The right thing for you.
That's all you've ever done at the head of that table.
Lead by greed.
CLAY:
Oh, if you hated me so much, why'd you sponsor me?
Patch me in?
(Piney laughs)
PINEY:
Because back then, you could be trusted.
CLAY:
Oh.
And so now I'm supposed to trust you?
These, um... pointed letters you're supposed to have-- what's to prevent you from showing them even after I kill the cartel deal?
PINEY:
That's a risk you're gonna have to take.
(Clay sighs)
CLAY:
Okay.
I'll call Romeo.
But if there's retaliation, that blood's on your hands.
(Piney yells, groans)
(yells, groans)
Where are the letters?
(Piney grunts)
Where did you put 'em?
(Piney groaning)
They're not here.
Where are they?
!
(Piney groans)
(Piney groans)
Tara still got 'em?
PINEY:
My God, how would Tara know?
CLAY:
She's the one that gave 'em to you.
You don't think I knew that, old man?
PINEY:
Just leave her out of it, huh?
CLAY:
Too late.
(grunts, guttural gasping)
(sighs)
My mother always used to say,
"people plan, and God laughs."
Which is funny, because Bizzy didn't even believe in God.
Do you?
I...
I don't know.
I mean, the idea of something bigger than me, a God, being in charge of my life is somehow comforting, I guess.
But it's also...
Unsettling.
I-I think, if there is a God, he doesn't want to hurt us or judge us.
Hurting and judging are distinctly human traits.
It's a letter from the medical board.
They're suspending my license, and they're coming after the practice.

- I can't come with you to Fiji.

What do you have holding you here?
Look, I just slipped.
Starting now, your surgical privileges at this hospital are revoked.
- Violet, if you run away again--
- Again?
You dropped Lucas in my lap and you ran!
I'm going.
Oh!
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
I'm still gonna want a baby, Sam.
I want to believe in a God who's...
Who's like the kind of parent I hope to be one day...
Accepting...
Loving, forgiving, present.
I mean, life's too hard to believe in the other kind.

Attention, passengers on flight 531 to New York, we apologize for the ongoing delay.
We're working to correct an issue with the hydraulics system and will announce a new departure time as soon as we have one.
- Thank you.
- Maybe the delay is a sign.
No, it's not.
We made the right decision.
It's time to go home.
Oh, really?
I don't know.
I feel like
- I should go back to my mother's house.
- Come on, Jo.
You don't throw away 12 years of marriage over one fight.
Trust me.
You'll see.
Okay?
We'll...
We'll work it out, like we always do.
This time is different.
You know that.
This time, I don't know if we can fix it.
Damn it.
Again.
Sam.
Not now.
Sam, how long has he been down?
- 45 minutes.
- You have to call it.
No.
- Sam, call it.
- Mnh-mnh.
Time of death... 10:17.
Thanks for coming in.
Duncan was on call, but he got stuck in the O.R. doing an aortic valve.
No problem.
Uh, if you're good here,
I was thinking about heading back home.
Hey.
I didn't know that you were-- yeah.
Uh, I have a mother-- uh, with triplets, went into early labor.
And they already have twins,
- so I am going to retire on that family.
- Hmm.
Did you deliver them yet?
No, no, she hasn't dilated yet.
Okay, so you're still waiting.
'Cause I was thinking--I'm--
- I think I'm done for the night.
- Oh.
Yeah.
So-- well, good news.
Pete never showed up for his shift, so, Sam, you can fill in.
- You can keep Addison company all night.
- Okay.
As long as you stop pretending that you two aren't back together, because you can't sell it, and it's making me uncomfortable.
Wait.
What happened to Pete now?
Oh, he's probably upset 'cause Violet went to New York.
What?
Yeah, I saw her at the airport.
What were you doing at the airport?
I was, uh, saying good-bye to Nai.
Hold on.
Violet just left?
She didn't say anything?
To you.
I'm sure she had some things to say to Pete.
Which is probably why he's upset.
Well, he coulda been upset here.
Lord knows there are enough people around to cheer him up.
Mm.
Pete's hard to cheer up.
He can get really dark.
Maybe I should go over there and see if I can get him out for a drink or I don't know, give him some time, take Lucas out for ice cream or something.
Either way, have a ball.
I'll be here...
With Sam and Addison.
I need coffee.
Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine.
God.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I don't usually melt down in public like this.
Oh, please.
Airports are like hospitals or high school dances.
Somebody's crying somewhere.
I'm-
- I'm Violet Turner.
Joanna Gibbs.
I heard you talking to your husband.
I'm so sorry.
I never eavesdrop.
But what are you gonna do in a place like this, right?
No, it's... it's fine.
We're fine.
I'm sure.
I keep telling myself the same thing.
I wrote a book, and I'm going to New York for this book tour, but I left my son and my husband at home.
And that's created a little bit of...
Drama.
But I guess that's what marriage is, right?
You fight, you work it out.
Rinse.
Repeat.
Yeah, sometimes it feels like that.
You just have to remind yourself, it moves the relationship forward.
Unless you're always fighting about the same thing.
I'm a lawyer.
I work horrendous hours.
And David, my husband...
He doesn't get it.
No.
He used to.
He's always been incredibly supportive.

Uh, 326 Las Brisas.
Come now.
Okay, stay with me, Pete.
No, it's his house.
His name is Pete Wilder.
I think it's a heart attack.
I got no pulse.
I'm starting c--
Four, five, six.
Okay, stay with me, Pete.
Ambulance is on the way.
Lucas?
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
Lucas, come out here, buddy.
20.
Lucas, I know it's scary, but we're taking care of your dad, okay?
Hey.
You okay?
I know it's scary, but we're just helping your dad, okay?
He's gonna be okay.
I promise.
Come on, Pete.
Come on, man.
There he is, my knight in shining armor.
You okay?
Fell down, need stitches, didn't think I should drive.
Thank you for coming.
Yeah.
You didn't think you should drive or the bartender took your keys?
Tomato, tomahto.
Amelia, y-- You're drunk.
Not quite.
I was on my way to being drunk when all of the unfortunate bleeding interrupted my evening.
What happened to AA, huh?
My problem was with pills, Sheldon, not booze.
Tomato, tomahto.
You tomahtoed me back.
That's clever.
I like that.
I like you.
Well, I like you, to but I'm worried about you.
Oh, please don't be.
And you're a drug addict using a drug.
Just because it comes in liquid form doesn't mean it's not a drug.
And addicts using drugs have consequences, for example, you need stitches in your hand--
Your Hopkins-trained neurosurgeon hand.
And that-
- That is a potentially severe consequence, and I--
Amelia.
Relax, Sheldon.
I'm not trying to sleep with you.
I just needed you to shut up so that you could give me a ride to the hospital, and I won't bleed to death in the street.
Could you do that for me?
Yeah.
I'll lecture you more later.
I figured.
Has he ever hit you before?
No.
Never.
No.
His hours are getting cut back at work.
Mine are getting worse, so he's always home, stewing.
I know it's a cliche, but it really was at least partially my fault.
Do you really believe that?
We were supposed to go for a run in the park, and... at the last minute, a client wanted a conference call.
Not the first time this has happened.
And we just...
Fell into our same pattern.
He got mad.
I got defensive.
We ended up fighting for so long that I was going to miss the call anyway, so...
I texted... my assistant while he was talking.
I know it drives him crazy, but I did it anyway.
And he... reacted...
Badly.
So you came out here.
See my mother.
And what does she have to say about what happened?
She adores David.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her.
Do you have any good friends in New York?
Great ones, actually.
I have a group from college and law school, plus some great women at work.
Have you told any of them what happened?
You haven't told anyone.
Things like this...
Are not supposed to happen to women like me.
How's he doing?
His pulse is thready.
He hasn't regained consciousness.
- I'll take Lucas.
- So we still don't know how long he's been down?
- No.
- Did you get ahold of Violet?
No, I left messages.
I think she's in the air.
Did you give him any antiarrhythmics?
Yeah, we bolused him times 2.
All right, I need an EKG, chem 20, enzymes, and a CBC.
He's on the monitors.
All right, give it to me.
He's having trouble breathing.
We need to control his airway.
- I'll intubate.
- I've got the chart right here.
All right, ST elevation in the anterior leads.
- He's having an acute m.I.
- How's it comin', Coop?
I can't visualize the cords.
- He's in V-fib.
- All right.
Almost there.
Almost there.
Charge 'em to 360.
Clear.
- Cooper!
- Ow.
You okay?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
All right, he's back in sinus, but we gotta get him to the cath lab and open those blocked arteries now.
Now.
Cooper.
- Go.
Go, go, go.
- Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm okay.
This is very MacGyver of you.
Shut up.
You gonna fashion a bomb out of nothing but your bra strap and that suture kit?
Stop thinking about my bra strap, Sheldon.
Yeah, actually, I was thinking that the E.R. would be a more suitable place for sutures.
Why don't we page Dr. Freud and ask him why you talked about my underwear instead?
Do you always use sexual innuendo to deflect potential conflict or is...
No, not always.
Only with men.
Could you hold this?
- Aah.
- Why aren't we in the E.R.?
Because interns do sutures in ERS and interns suck.
But why else?
Amelia.
I don't want to run into Charlotte, okay?
She'll start quoting the AA big book at me, and I am in no mood.
I see.
So sexual innuendo for men, and with women, it's...
- Avoidance.
- Got it.
And you're planning to suture your hand yourself?
Well, I was hoping you could help.
I'm a shrink.
I suck worse than the interns.
No.
In that case, yes,
I'm planning to suture my own hand.
But you have to give me the shot to numb it.
Can you handle that or is my bra strap too distracting?
Hey.
Hey.
Where is Pete?
They, uh, took him to, um...
The cath lab.
How's he doing?
S-Sam had to, um, paddle him to get his...
His rhythm back, but, you know, fine.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Uh... either Pete has a really narrow trachea or somebody handed me the wrong size e.T. Tube, because...
I wasn't quite done intubating him when Sam yelled "clear"...
Oh.
And I got a little...
Oh, Coop.
I-I'm just a little...
- Spacey?
- Uh...
- Tingly?
- Yeah.
Oh.
I remember, my first year...
Of residency,
I scrubbed in on an abdominal hysterectomy, and, uh, I was standing down by the patient's knee, so I had to lean in to get a better look.
Midway through, her heart stopped.
I remember the attending grabbing the paddles, calling "clear."
I lifted my hands up, but my entire stomach was still touching her legs.
Mommy.
When I got to the house, he was... under the dining room table, hiding.
He saw?
Sweetie, you're gonna be okay.
We gotta figure out a way to get in touch with Violet.
It's not like I didn't want to tell somebody.
I...
I don't know how to talk about it.
You're doing great.
Because you're a stranger.
But my mother, my friends-- I'd be too embarrassed.
Everyone knows
Joanna Gibbs, phi beta kappa, order of the coif, youngest partner at the firm.
If I tell them what happened,
I'll just be Joanna Gibbs, battered wife.
Here he comes.
- Go to the ladies room.
- What?
Go to the ladies room.
I'll meet you there.
The coffee in here smelled kinda grim, so I went out to the terminal.
I got a you a vanilla latte in case--
I have to go to the bathroom.
Jo, are you all right?
Is she okay?
I don't know.
The vessel's tight.
- He's still having runs of v-tach.
- Lucas.
- I'm having difficulty inserting the stent.
- Lucas.
He's fine.
He's with Addison.
Sam.
Is his face...
It's not good.
Muscle paralysis, right side.
Either his heart was stopped long enough that he's already had some brain damage or there's a bleed.
We should page Amelia.
Let's pray this is reversible.
Get the neuro on call here now.
It should be Amelia.
We'll take whoever's closest.
The catheter dissected his coronary artery.
He's bleeding into his chest.
Start compressions.
We lost his pulse.
We gotta get him to the O.R., get him on bypass.
We're not gonna have enough time.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Go.
Sam, his eyes.
All right, there's just enough circulation to perfuse his brain.
- Don't stop.
- I'm tryin'!
Mm.
Is that it?
Yep.
How are you?
Y-you okay?
Nothing will sober you up like repeatedly puncturing your own flesh with sharp metal.
Oh, yeah.
I need a drink.
You wanna come?
How about I take you to a meeting instead?
How about you stop sounding exactly like Charlotte?
Are you on call?
Were you drinking while you were on call?
God, Sheldon.
No, I'm not on call, but--
But they are paging me anyway.
Amelia.
What's going on?
Did Charlotte call you?
No, but I just got a page from Sam.
Why do you have Lucas?
You guys, what's going on?
Hi.
Are you okay?
David is not a violent man.
This...
Was just a fluke.
But you left him to go somewhere safe.
Do you have any reason to doubt that instinct?
You don't understand the relationship that David and I have.
Maybe not.
But I do know what it feels like to be the victim of violence.
I know how it feels when the confidence and security that you thought you had goes out the window.
And if you ever want that back, that sense of control over your own life...
You can't just not tell anyone and pretend it didn't happen.
Nobody ever really gets to control their life.
You-
- You meet a guy, you fall in love, you make all these plans, and then...
Your husband's career doesn't...
Work out the way he thought it would.
He gets frustrated and angry because who wouldn't?
I know how that sounds.
But marriage is complicated.
And you're not inside this one.
You make sacrifices to get through...
He hit you.
The hard times.
- That's not a sacrifice.
That's abuse.
- Okay.
We have to stop.
Because really...
What qualifies you to define my relationship and tell me what to do?
You seem like a very nice person, and I appreciate your concern.
I do.
But this is just none of your business.
I have to...
I have to get back to my husba..
Does Violet know?
No, she's on a plane to New York.
I called, I e-mailed, I texted.
I don't have good news.
Pete's pressure keeps bottoming out.
Sam took him to the O.R. to put him on bypass.
What are you doing here?
I got a page that Sam needed me.
Is Pete having neuro complications?
Slurred speech and a facial droop.
Probably a CVA.
Oh, God.
Buddle's on his way.
Well, I'm here now.
What happened to your hand?
My hand's fine.
I'm gonna go talk to Sam.
Amelia.
What happened to her hand?
She cut it.
It needed some stitches.
It's...
It's fine.
What's happening?
He's on bypass.
He's gonna need a 4-vessel graft.
- He also may have a bleed.
- Why are you waiting?
Dye.
He had two long sessions of CPR.
The high-peak pressure might have ruptured one of his vessels.
There.
If I get in now, I can clamp it.
He's already on bypass.
I have four arteries to graft first.
By the time you're done, Pete'll be lucky if he can drool.
Look, you take care of your part, I'll do mine.
Okay, 11-blade...
- Let's prep for a left-side craniotomy.
- Potts scissors, now.
Clear the fluoroscope.
I'm gonna need a craniotome, a joker, and some bone wax.
Stop.
Amelia, I said stop.
You know, we should switch seats.
That's where I was sitting for the Violet-Katie thing.
And?
Well, that turned out okay, so...
I should sit there again.
And this is where I was sitting when Dell died.
Oh, well, even more so.
I wasn't here either of those times.
I was operating, so...
No, okay, you can stay there, but you and me...
How do y t think Sam and Amelia are doing?
I think Sam and Amelia are exactly who I'd want in there, but...
But what?
Having everyone count on you to save the life of someone they love, trying to set aside your own feelings, it's hard, that's all.
Hey, Lucas.
You hungry?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
Let's try to go find something good to eat.
There we go.
Call me if you hear anything, okay?
Yeah.
Any word from Violet?
Not yet.
But this says her plan hasn't left.
I mean, she's still gotta be at the airport, right?
Can I do anything?
What the hell are you doing?
Pete's got an arterial bleed.
If I don't clamp it-- buddie's ten minutes out.
- He doesn't have ten minutes.
- What the hell is going on here?
She cut her hand.
- But I'm fine.
- Are you?
Charlotte, I'm fine.
You can say that without any--
Hey, whatever's going on between the two of you, now is not the time to work it out.
Amelia, can you cut?
- It's my left hand.
I'm a righty.
- Okay, then.

"I don't want to be without him.

Hello.
Hey, Violet.
Whose phone is this?
No, okay, he's still in surgery.
Okay, I will check myself right now, okay?
I'm checking.
Okay, he's ready to come off pump.
You done yet?
Almost there.
I gotta get him off this pump now, Amelia.
The vessel's done, but I still gotta close.
Just take him off.
Okay.
Arterial...
Off.
Venous... off.
Ok..
We got him back.
All right.
Got him back.
Hey, guys.
How's, uh...
We lost his pressure again.
All right, he's in v-fib.
Damn it.
Cooper, I need you to scrub in.
Pete's still in the O.R. Cooper's checking on him.
I'm not gonna wait on Cooper.
Hey.
Is he--
He's fine, Violet.
Go.
Okay.
I'm not getting anything.
What can I do?
All right, charge again.
- It's not working.
- Sam.
Come here.
Squeeze.
Give me 5 cc's of epi, 1 to 1,000.
Come on.
Don't be gentle.
Squeeze.
Violet.
He's been in and out of consciousness, but the grafts are holding.
His cardiac output is on target--
And he's gonna be okay?
Yeah.
He's gonna be okay.
Oh...
Recovery's gonna be tough, but you know that.
And in a couple of weeks, when you get around to making those thank-you baskets...
Sam only saved his life once.
I saved it twice.
This is true.
Yep.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Both of you.
Uh, what am I supposed to say to him now,
"I'm sorry"?
It sounds so pathetic, but I do want to apologize-- for what?
I-
- If I hadn't argued with him and then left--
Oh, come on.
You did not cause this.
Violet, you c-
- You couldn't have done anything to stop it.
It was bad luck.
Yeah, go see him.
You'll feel better.
Yeah.
Oh, don't be worried if he seems a little, uh, euphoric.
His hormones are still a little bit scrambled from the anesthesia and bypass.
Wait a minute.
So you're saying Pete's in there acting like Mr. Rogers but with a zipper scar?
It'll wear off.
You better get in there.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, you are beautiful.
Oh, and my chest hurts.
Mm.
You had a heart attack.
Sam did a quadruple bypass.
Then you had a brain bleed, so Amelia had to get in there.
Oh, that explains the headache.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Mm.
Oh.
You know what?
I know it sounds odd, but honestly...
I think I'm okay.
Yeah, I-I think that I can get up now.
Okay, okay.
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe--
Oh.
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh.
Oh.
I love you.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
You're okay, and I'm here, and...
We fought.
And then I left...
Again.
And it felt like I was going to something this time, not just away, but I know it probably didn't feel that way to you.
And then Lucas...
If I hadn't gone, maybe none of this would've happened.
Violet, stop.
I'm okay.
You're okay, and Lucas is okay, and that's all that matters, right?
You are so beautiful.
Hey.
Hey yourself.
So good about Pete, right?
You know, heart's better, head's fine.
I mean, that leak turned out to be pretty large, but I clipped it.
Rocked it is actually what I did.
Hey, um...
Thanks for, you know, saying that you were worried about my hand.
I appreciate that.
You're not welcome, Amelia.
Okay.
What I mean by that is, I will not enable you and I will not protect you anymore, not ever again.
It's a onetime deal.
Until you get your sobriety in hand--
Look, I am not a drunk.
Charlotte, I have never been a drunk.
The fact that you're trying to draw a distinction between booze and drugs tells me you're in trouble,
- 'cause you know better...
- Mm-hmm.
And you been around long enough to see how this goes.
Alcoholics go out on pills, they go crazy.
Addicts go out on booze, and they think they can handle it, but they can't.
- I am fine.
- No, you're not.
The fact is, Amelia, I care about you too much to trust you right now.
Your privileges are still suspended.
Next time someone pages you, don't answer.
Okay, I swear to God, if you start right now--
I was just gonna offer you a ride home.
I'd appreciate that.
What's wrong?
I'm mad at you.
I couldn't be mad last night, but now Pete's stable, now you've seen him, so now I can be mad, and I am... really mad.
About what?
About you just picking up and leaving your husband and your problems...
It almost killed me the last time you did it, and you just did it again.
You're right.
Okay, you do not get to deal with losing your license by just getting on an airplane.
And you can't end an argument with Pete
- by just leaving town.
- You're right.
This is your life, Violet.
You gotta stick around and fight for it.
Wait, Cooper.
I said you're right.
And you need to get a new cell phone with a better battery.
(Addison) Hey.
Hey.
- Oh.
- There's mama.
Hi, buddy.
Aww.
Oh, I missed you so much.
It has been...
A crazy night.
He's been mostly sleeping, but he did eat.
I mean, just cookies, which I know isn't great, but--
Oh, it's fine.
Thank you, Addison.
All right.
You ready to go home?
Mm-hmm.
Just you and me?
Turns out I'm not going away after all.
Uh-oh.
Hello.

So I spent the night in the hospital, and I'm here to watch her for the next couple of days.
Oh, I'm...
Sorry about that.

Pete never showed up for his shift, so, Sam, you can fill in.

Wait.
What happened to Pete now?
Oh, he's probably upset 'cause Violet went to New York.
(Cooper) What?
Yeah, I saw her at the airport.
What were you doing at the airport?
I was, uh, saying good-bye to Nai.
Hold on.
Violet just left?
She didn't say anything?
To you.
I'm sure she had some things to say to Pete.
Which is probably why he's upset.
Well, he coulda been upset here.
Lord knows there are enough people around to cheer him up.
Mm.
Pete's hard to cheer up.
He can get really dark.
Maybe I should go over there and see if I can get him out for a drink or I don't know, give him some time, take Lucas out for ice cream or something.

You okay?
Fell down, need stitches, didn't think I should drive.
Thank you for coming.
Yeah.
You didn't think you should drive or the bartender took your keys?
Tomato, tomahto.
Amelia, y-- You're drunk.
Not quite.
I was on my way to being drunk when all of the unfortunate bleeding interrupted my evening.
What happened to AA, huh?
My problem was with pills, Sheldon, not booze.
Tomato, tomahto.
(Chuckles) You tomahtoed me back.
That's clever.
I like that.
I like you.
Well, I like you, to but I'm worried about you.
Oh, please don't be.
And you're a drug addict using a drug.
Just because it comes in liquid form doesn't mean it's not a drug.
And addicts using drugs have consequences, for example, you need stitches in your hand--
Your Hopkins-trained neurosurgeon hand.
And that-
- That is a potentially severe consequence, and I--
Amelia.
Relax, Sheldon.
I'm not trying to sleep with you.
I just needed you to shut up so that you could give me a ride to the hospital, and I won't bleed to death in the street.
Could you do that for me?
Yeah.
I'll lecture you more later.
I figured. (Exhales)
Has he ever hit you before?
No.
Never.
No.
His hours are getting cut back at work.
Mine are getting worse, so he's always home, stewing.
I know it's a cliche, but it really was at least partially my fault.
Do you really believe that?
(Sniffles)
We were supposed to go for a run in the park, and... at the last minute, a client wanted a conference call.
Not the first time this has happened.
And we just...
Fell into our same pattern.
He got mad.
I got defensive.
We ended up fighting for so long that I was going to miss the call anyway, so... (Exhales)
I texted... my assistant while he was talking.
I know it drives him crazy, but I did it anyway.
And he... reacted...
Badly.
So you came out here.
See my mother.
And what does she have to say about what happened?
She adores David.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her.
Do you have any good friends in New York?
Great ones, actually.
I have a group from college and law school, plus some great women at work.
Have you told any of them what happened?
You haven't told anyone.
Things like this... (Whispers) Are not supposed to happen to women like me.
(Exhales deeply)
(Siren wailing) (Sam) How's he doing?
His pulse is thready.
He hasn't regained consciousness.
- I'll take Lucas.
- So we still don't know how long he's been down?
(Cooper)
- No.
- Did you get ahold of Violet?
No, I left messages.
I think she's in the air.
Did you give him any antiarrhythmics?
Yeah, we bolused him times 2.
All right, I need an EKG, chem 20, enzymes, and a CBC.
(Cooper) He's on the monitors.
All right, give it to me.
He's having trouble breathing.
We need to control his airway.
- I'll intubate.
- I've got the chart right here.
All right, ST elevation in the anterior leads.
- He's having an acute m.I.
- How's it comin', Coop?
I can't visualize the cords.
(Monitor beeping erratically)
- He's in V-fib.
- All right.
Almost there.
Almost there.
Charge 'em to 360.
(Beeping continues)
Clear.
(Paddles thunk)
(Charlotte)
- Cooper!
- Ow.
You okay?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
All right, he's back in sinus, but we gotta get him to the cath lab and open those blocked arteries now.
Now.
Cooper.
- Go.
Go, go, go.
- Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm okay.
This is very MacGyver of you.
Shut up.
You gonna fashion a bomb out of nothing but your bra strap and that suture kit?
Stop thinking about my bra strap, Sheldon.
Yeah, actually, I was thinking that the E.R. would be a more suitable place for sutures.
Why don't we page Dr. Freud and ask him why you talked about my underwear instead?
Do you always use sexual innuendo to deflect potential conflict or is...
No, not always.
Only with men.
Could you hold this?
(Exhales)
(Blows air)
(Blows air)
(Both grunt)
- Aah.
- Why aren't we in the E.R.?
Because interns do sutures in ERS and interns suck.
But why else?
Amelia.
I don't want to run into Charlotte, okay?
She'll start quoting the AA big book at me, and I am in no mood.
I see.
So sexual innuendo for men, and with women, it's...
- Avoidance.
- Got it.
And you're planning to suture your hand yourself?
Well, I was hoping you could help.
(Laughs)
I'm a shrink.
I suck worse than the interns.
No.
(Sighs)
In that case, yes,
I'm planning to suture my own hand.
But you have to give me the shot to numb it.
Can you handle that or is my bra strap too distracting?
(Whimpers)
(Indistinct conversations)
Hey.
Hey.
Where is Pete?
They, uh, took him to, um...
The cath lab.
How's he doing?
S-Sam had to, um, paddle him to get his...
His rhythm back, but, you know, fine.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Uh... either Pete has a really narrow trachea or somebody handed me the wrong size e.T. Tube, because...
I wasn't quite done intubating him when Sam yelled "clear"...
Oh. (Chuckles)
And I got a little...
Oh, Coop.
I-I'm just a little...
- Spacey?
- Uh...
- Tingly?
- Yeah.
Oh. (Laughs)
I remember, my first year...
Of residency,
I scrubbed in on an abdominal hysterectomy, and, uh, I was standing down by the patient's knee, so I had to lean in to get a better look.
Midway through, her heart stopped.
I remember the attending grabbing the paddles, calling "clear."
I lifted my hands up, but my entire stomach was still touching her legs.
(Both laugh)
(Lucas) Mommy.
When I got to the house, he was... under the dining room table, hiding.
He saw?
(Singsongy) Sweetie, you're gonna be okay. (Kisses)
We gotta figure out a way to get in touch with Violet.
It's not like I didn't want to tell somebody.
I...
I don't know how to talk about it.
You're doing great.
Because you're a stranger.
But my mother, my friends-- I'd be too embarrassed.
Everyone knows
Joanna Gibbs, phi beta kappa, order of the coif, youngest partner at the firm.
If I tell them what happened,
I'll just be Joanna Gibbs, battered wife.
Here he comes.
- Go to the ladies room.
- What?
Go to the ladies room.
I'll meet you there.
The coffee in here smelled kinda grim, so I went out to the terminal.
I got a you a vanilla latte in case--
I have to go to the bathroom.
Jo, are you all right?
Is she okay?
I don't know.
(Sighs)

(Monitor beeping rhythmically) The vessel's tight.

- Lucas.
- I'm having difficulty inserting the stent.
- Lucas.
He's fine.
He's with Addison.
Sam.
Is his face...
It's not good.
Muscle paralysis, right side.
Either his heart was stopped long enough that he's already had some brain damage or there's a bleed.
We should page Amelia.
Let's pray this is reversible.
Get the neuro on call here now.
It should be Amelia.
We'll take whoever's closest.
(Monitor beeping) The catheter dissected his coronary artery.
He's bleeding into his chest.
Start compressions.
We lost his pulse.
We gotta get him to the O.R., get him on bypass.
We're not gonna have enough time.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Go.
Sam, his eyes.
All right, there's just enough circulation to perfuse his brain.
- Don't stop.
- I'm tryin'!
Mm.
Is that it?
(Inhales sharply) Yep.
(Exhales deeply) How are you?
Y-you okay?
Nothing will sober you up like repeatedly puncturing your own flesh with sharp metal.
Oh, yeah.

You wanna come?
(Laughs)
How about I take you to a meeting instead?
How about you stop sounding exactly like Charlotte?
(Pager vibrates)
Are you on call?
Were you drinking while you were on call?
God, Sheldon.
No, I'm not on call, but--
But they are paging me anyway.
Amelia.
What's going on?
Did Charlotte call you?
No, but I just got a page from Sam.
Why do you have Lucas?
You guys, what's going on?
Hi.
Are you okay?
David is not a violent man.
This...
Was just a fluke.
But you left him to go somewhere safe.
Do you have any reason to doubt that instinct?
You don't understand the relationship that David and I have.
Maybe not.
But I do know what it feels like to be the victim of violence.
I know how it feels when the confidence and security that you thought you had goes out the window.
And if you ever want that back, that sense of control over your own life...
You can't just not tell anyone and pretend it didn't happen.
Nobody ever really gets to control their life.
You-
- You meet a guy, you fall in love, you make all these plans, and then...
Your husband's career doesn't...
Work out the way he thought it would.
He gets frustrated and angry because who wouldn't?
I know how that sounds.
But marriage is complicated.
And you're not inside this one.
You make sacrifices to get through...
He hit you.
The hard times.
- That's not a sacrifice.
That's abuse.
- Okay.
We have to stop.
Because really...
What qualifies you to define my relationship and tell me what to do?
You seem like a very nice person, and I appreciate your concern.
I do.
But this is just none of your business.
I have to...
I have to get back to my husba..
Does Violet know?
No, she's on a plane to New York.
I called, I e-mailed, I texted.
I don't have good news.
Pete's pressure keeps bottoming out.
Sam took him to the O.R. to put him on bypass.
What are you doing here?
I got a page that Sam needed me.
Is Pete having neuro complications?
Slurred speech and a facial droop.
Probably a CVA.
Oh, God.
Buddle's on his way.
Well, I'm here now.
What happened to your hand?
My hand's fine.
I'm gonna go talk to Sam.
Amelia.
What happened to her hand?
She cut it.
It needed some stitches.
It's...
It's fine.
What's happening?
He's on bypass.
He's gonna need a 4-vessel graft.
- He also may have a bleed.
- Why are you waiting?
Dye.
He had two long sessions of CPR.
The high-peak pressure might have ruptured one of his vessels.
There.
If I get in now, I can clamp it.
He's already on bypass.
I have four arteries to graft first.
By the time you're done, Pete'll be lucky if he can drool.
Look, you take care of your part, I'll do mine.
Okay, 11-blade...
- Let's prep for a left-side craniotomy.
- Potts scissors, now.
Clear the fluoroscope.
I'm gonna need a craniotome, a joker, and some bone wax.
Stop.
Amelia, I said stop.
You know, we should switch seats.
That's where I was sitting for the Violet-Katie thing.
And?
Well, that turned out okay, so...
I should sit there again.
And this is where I was sitting when Dell died.
Oh, well, even more so.
I wasn't here either of those times.
I was operating, so...
No, okay, you can stay there, but you and me...
How do y t think Sam and Amelia are doing?
I think Sam and Amelia are exactly who I'd want in there, but...
But what?
Having everyone count on you to save the life of someone they love, trying to set aside your own feelings, it's hard, that's all.
Hey, Lucas.
You hungry?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
Let's try to go find something good to eat.
There we go.
Call me if you hear anything, okay?
Yeah.
Any word from Violet?
Not yet.
But this says her plan hasn't left.
I mean, she's still gotta be at the airport, right?
Can I do anything?
What the hell are you doing?
Pete's got an arterial bleed.
If I don't clamp it-- buddie's ten minutes out.
- He doesn't have ten minutes.
- What the hell is going on here?
She cut her hand.
- But I'm fine.
- Are you?
Charlotte, I'm fine.
You can say that without any--
Hey, whatever's going on between the two of you, now is not the time to work it out.
Amelia, can you cut?
- It's my left hand.
I'm a righty.
- Okay, then.

We're done.
Come on.
Excuse me, are you Dr. Violet Turner?
I have an emergency call for you from Dr. Freedman.

(Charlotte) I didn't have a choice, did I?
I mean, Amelia was there.
It couldn't wait.
You did not have a choice.
And, you know, hopefully, if she had any doubt that she could do it, she wouldn't have pushed so hard.
Amelia never has any doubts.
That's what I'm worried about.
But it's Pete.
You did not have a choice.
What if one of us died?
Are you seriously asking me this right now?
When I was 14 and my dad had that heart attack, it scared the hell out of me.
But the worst part...
Was I remember being in the hospital with my mom, and she kept saying--
Not even to me, she just kept repeating--
"I don't want to be without him.
I can't be without him."
And I just...
Haven't you ever thought about it?
Ever?
Yes.
But at this moment, it's not you and me I'm worried about.
Would you get married again?
♪ Oh ♪
Would you not want me to?
I don't know.
I guess...
I mean, I'd want you to be happy, so... ♪ Oh ♪
You could get married again, what about me?
I'd want you to be miserable every day for the rest of your life.
(Laughs) (Cell phone rings)
You asked.
(Ring, beep)
Hello.
Hey, Violet.
Whose phone is this?
No, okay, he's still in surgery.
Okay, I will check myself right now, okay?
I'm checking.
(Sam) Okay, he's ready to come off pump.
You done yet?
(Amelia) Almost there.
I gotta get him off this pump now, Amelia.
The vessel's done, but I still gotta close.
Just take him off.
Okay.
Arterial...
Off.
Venous... off.
(Monitor emitting continuous sound)
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)
(Exhales) Ok..
We got him back.
All right.
Got him back.
(Beeping continues)
Hey, guys.
How's, uh... (Monitor beeping erratically) We lost his pressure again.
All right, he's in v-fib.
Damn it.
Cooper, I need you to scrub in.
(Beeping continues)
Pete's still in the O.R. Cooper's checking on him.
I'm not gonna wait on Cooper.
Hey.
Is he--
He's fine, Violet.
Go.
Okay. (Kisses)
(Monitor beeping erratically)
I'm not getting anything.
What can I do?
All right, charge again.
- It's not working.
(Cooper)
- Sam.
Come here.
Squeeze.
Give me 5 cc's of epi, 1 to 1,000.
Come on.
Don't be gentle.
Squeeze.
(Beeping continues)
Violet.
(Beeping continues)
He's been in and out of consciousness, but the grafts are holding.
His cardiac output is on target--
And he's gonna be okay?
Yeah.
He's gonna be okay.
(Crying)
Oh... (Continues crying)
(Exhales deeply)
Recovery's gonna be tough, but you know that.
(Sniffles)
And in a couple of weeks, when you get around to making those thank-you baskets...
Sam only saved his life once.
I saved it twice.
(Laughs)
This is true.
Yep.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Both of you.
Uh, what am I supposed to say to him now,
"I'm sorry"?
It sounds so pathetic, but I do want to apologize-- for what?
I-
- If I hadn't argued with him and then left--
Oh, come on.
You did not cause this.
Violet, you c-
- You couldn't have done anything to stop it.
It was bad luck.
Yeah, go see him.
You'll feel better.
Yeah.
(Telephone rings)
Oh, don't be worried if he seems a little, uh, euphoric.
His hormones are still a little bit scrambled from the anesthesia and bypass.
Wait a minute.
So you're saying Pete's in there acting like Mr. Rogers but with a zipper scar?
It'll wear off.
You better get in there.
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)
(Chair wheels clatter)
Hey.
(Chuckles)
Oh, my God.
Oh, you are beautiful.
(Chuckles)
(Laughs)
Oh, and my chest hurts.
Mm.
You had a heart attack.
Sam did a quadruple bypass.
Then you had a brain bleed, so Amelia had to get in there.
(Raspy voice) Oh, that explains the headache.
(Laughs) Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Mm. (Chuckles)
Oh.
You know what?
I know it sounds odd, but honestly...
I think I'm okay.
Yeah, I-I think that I can get up now.
Okay, okay.
Maybe tomorrow.
(Groans)
Maybe--
Oh. (Laughs) Okay, okay, okay.
Oh.
Oh. (Sighs)
I love you.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
You're okay, and I'm here, and...
We fought.
And then I left...
Again.
And it felt like I was going to something this time, not just away, but I know it probably didn't feel that way to you.
And then Lucas...
If I hadn't gone, maybe none of this would've happened.
Violet, stop.
I'm okay.
You're okay, and Lucas is okay, and that's all that matters, right?
(Chuckles)
You are so beautiful.
(Laughs)
(Laughs)
Hey.
Hey yourself.
So good about Pete, right?
You know, heart's better, head's fine.
I mean, that leak turned out to be pretty large, but I clipped it.
Rocked it is actually what I did.
Hey, um...
Thanks for, you know, saying that you were worried about my hand.
I appreciate that.
You're not welcome, Amelia.
Okay.
What I mean by that is, I will not enable you and I will not protect you anymore, not ever again.
It's a onetime deal.
Until you get your sobriety in hand--
Look, I am not a drunk.
Charlotte, I have never been a drunk.
The fact that you're trying to draw a distinction between booze and drugs tells me you're in trouble,
- 'cause you know better...
- Mm-hmm.
And you been around long enough to see how this goes.
Alcoholics go out on pills, they go crazy.
Addicts go out on booze, and they think they can handle it, but they can't.
- I am fine.
- No, you're not.
The fact is, Amelia, I care about you too much to trust you right now.
Your privileges are still suspended.
Next time someone pages you, don't answer.
(Sighs)
Okay, I swear to God, if you start right now--
I was just gonna offer you a ride home.
I'd appreciate that.
(Sniffles)
What's wrong?
I'm mad at you.
I couldn't be mad last night, but now Pete's stable, now you've seen him, so now I can be mad, and I am... really mad.
About what?
About you just picking up and leaving your husband and your problems...
It almost killed me the last time you did it, and you just did it again.
You're right.
Okay, you do not get to deal with losing your license by just getting on an airplane.
And you can't end an argument with Pete
- by just leaving town.
- You're right.
This is your life, Violet.
You gotta stick around and fight for it.
Wait, Cooper.
I said you're right.
And you need to get a new cell phone with a better battery.
(Laughs) (Addison) Hey.
(Laughs) Hey.
- Oh.
(Lucas)
- There's mama.
Hi, buddy.
Aww.
Oh, I missed you so much.
It has been...
A crazy night.
He's been mostly sleeping, but he did eat.
I mean, just cookies, which I know isn't great, but--
Oh, it's fine.
Thank you, Addison.
All right.
You ready to go home?
Mm-hmm.
Just you and me?
(Kisses)
Turns out I'm not going away after all.
(Cell phone rings)
Uh-oh.
Hello.
Hey.
Joanna, you're still here.
No.
No, no, no.
I really want to talk to you.
(Voice breaking) Life is hard.
It's hard and... (Sniffles) Scary and out of my control, and that's the part that makes me the craziest--
The fact that I cannot control the world or what happens to the people I love.

What are you doing today, hon?
Study English in the morning
- Read history cartoon books at 1.
- And?
Research the Louvre at 3 o' clock.
And exercise at 4 o' clock.
Wow!
Busy!
Busy!
Busy!
Really busy!
- Apple!
- Chapel!
- Cap full!

- Babble!

Do you even know what babble means?
Doesn't it mean to jabber?
Wow!
That's my boy!
You're the smartest!
I hope this is good.
It's hot!
I'm off to keep our country healthy!
I love you so much!
I love you too, mommy!
Lunch's in the microwave.
Make sure you exercise, okay?
- Bye, mom!
- Bye!
# To the end of this world
# I will devote entirely to you
# And hold you # in my arms.
Min-hyuck.
Min-hyuck?
Hey Min-hyuck!
Was it my turn?
What are you doing?
I've always wanted to do pantomime on the stage.
- Sorry?
- This is an orange.
Look.
I'm peeling it.
It's really easy.
Don't believe there's an orange here.
Just forget that there isn't one.
So sour!
You're good.
Very good.
What a loser.
- This is bullshit.
- Come on.
It would be easier for me to pretend to love an orange than her.
She's my mother's age!
How can I pretend I love someone like that?
That's a bit too harsh, isn't it?
This is professor HANG.
She's the hottest singer in Korea!
Didn't you tell me to try acting when you were auditioning me?
Would you be able to act in a situation like this?
Could you pretend to love that wrinkled old granny?
- It's just acting.
- No it's not!
This is a scam!
Hey!
Min-hyuck!
What's up with you man?
Have some orange, sir!
What's with the orange today?
I was worried about doing a musical but the music's quite elegant!
I feel good about this, better than when I did Madame Butterfly in 97.
You always feel good.
But your personality sucks.
I can't believe Min-hyuck's an idol star..
He's got perfect body but he's not very bright, is he?
Idol my ass.
He's an idiot.
At least his voice isn't too bad for a young man.
Hey!
You think they're your clothes?
Careful with those hot pants!
- Where to next?
- Home.
Hello, sir!
Yes, I'm in this one too.
They just insist they can't do it without me.
I know, I know.
I'm incredibly busy.
Time to go.
KOO Seung-cheul!
You son of a bitch!
I'm a bit busy so I gotta get going.
My boys will get through to you.
You have something to say?
You say it!
How dare you kick me out and
Leave me with your boys?
We have to get rough if you keep on lying like this.
Plus!
My boys punch better than me.
Got it?
I have no time to goof around with you.
Fuck!
God damn it!
KOO!
How dare you!
I'm sorry,!
Grandma!
I told you it looks barbaric to run like that.
And don't call me grandma.
I'm Professor HANG.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
Bye, now.
Mrs. HANG!
You're home early!
We picked up some good pork.
Join us for dinner?
Yeah!
Eat with us, Professor Grandma!
We can't stink up Professor HANG's house.
She'll freak out.
Plus, she's having just a slice of tofu tonight, alone.
We can't cramp her style.
You speak as ugly as your face.
Let's go in.
Sweetie, we're having tofu for dinner today.
- No!
- it'll be good!
- Just do it.
- I said no!
Hey!
Fuck!
Let go!
- What did you steal?
- Shit!
- Hey!
- I said let go!
It's just cheap yogurt!
Then you pay for it!
That's okay.
What'll become of that rascal!
Sorry to scare you, sir.
- No, no.
- Thank you.
No problem.
Here.
Let's just say I bought those kids that yogurt.
Here.
Take it.
Then let me get you a few things.
Just wait here for a bit.
Please.
- Mom!
- Well!
Is this my dear son?
There was crazy traffic jam!
Am I late?
- No, you're just on time!
- Good!
Smells so good!
- Dinner will be ready soon.
- Okay.
Samba samba samba samba!
- For you!
- Thanks.
Samba samba samba!
This is amazing, mom.
You've got magic hands!
It's not that good but thank you anyway.
- Honey?
- Yeah?
- Say Cheese Please
- What's that?
If you keep on saying CHEESE PLEASE like this you'll get smiley wrinkles.
I'm just worried about your face these days.
It's threatening like a gangster face.
How can you say that to a teacher?
That's cruel, mom!
You have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
- Okay.
- These are too thin.
I'm scared.
Scare of what, mom?
Don't you worry!
If anything happens I'll set fire to that damn place.
Geez!
What a potty mouth!
You're a teacher!
But I can't help feeling anxious.
Come on mom!
I said don't worry about a thing!
Just drop by at the hospital then come home to pack.
I'll send you to Japan for hot springs next week.
What?
I just got back from Canada!
Stop wasting your money on me.
But I like hot springs!
Why can't you pronounce Canada?
Say Ka-Na-Da!
No!
It's Canada!
Like the Gana Fish Sauce!
Here.
This is good for you.
Sweetie?
- Look at this.
- Yeah?
Hey lady!
Listen to my son's English.
What's bean curd in English?
That's easy!
De... defireve.e. In English, it's defireve..
I'm so proud of you, son!
Excuse me.
I just wanna help out.
I heard you speaking.
I'm an English teacher.
It's not defireve.
It's Tofu.
This is tofu.
Okay?
He's a bit lost.
It's not defireve.
It's defireve...
Fierve!
Okay?
Yeah, I hear you.
But it's no defireve..
It's tofu.
What the hell is he on about?
You America?
- I'm an Australian.
- So you are!
He's speaking our language!
You speak Korean!
Why give me a hard time?
So how do you say that in Australian?
- Tofu.
- Tofu?
Yeah.
Just say defireve just once.
Or get out of here.
- Okay?
- Tofu.
Right.
Get going.
You speak Korean so well!
How amazing!
Mom, don't even talk to him.
No one who speaks English calls that tofu!
We all call it defireve.
- I'm an English teacher.
- Right.
- Dumb bastard!
- Yeah, dumb bastard!
Go learn proper English, you fool!
COULD YOU COME CLEAN THE FRIDGE TODAY?
Of course I can!
What time?
6 in the morning?
You must be so pissed off.
But men are just like that.
What was that?
Oh my God!
Oh, shoot!
Are you okay, ma'am?
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
- Oh no.
- It's okay.
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?
No, there's no need.
- Go to a hospital.
- I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Really!
I'm fine.
You can go.
It's okay.
You can go.
Then let me buy some yogurt from you.
Really?
You really don't have to.
Why don't you try this.
This is an instant solution.
When you drink it, you poop out this much!
Okay then.
I'll take ten.
Ten?
I mean, give me twenty.
Twenty?
This much!
You're amazing.
What do you work so hard for?
To travel around the world with my son.
Is your son sick?
There's always new medicine.
My son will get better soon.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- Don't you worry!
- I'm sorry again.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Thank you!
What the hell did you just say?
Where are you going?
Who told you to go?
You asshole!
- Calm down, sir.
- No.
You piece of shit!
How dare you scream!
Don't think we can do it without you?
Please calm down!
You asshole!
Damn it!
They're out of organic stuff.
Just use this.
I don't know why I even hired you.
The director seems pretty ticked off.
What's with him?
That idol quit.
He doesn't like me.
Hi, Professor KIM.
Yeah, I called.
Are you busy these days?
Wanna do a musical?
I'm in it.
The staff are best in the country.
Just tell them I recommended you.
They know who I am.
Right?
Get ready to go to the lecture.
The organizers will contact you soon.
I gave them your number.
Hey!
Mom, I'm here!
Hey, guys!
Look how much you've grown!
Walking already?
Hi Choco!
You're so cute!
Hey!
Stop eating!
Where's mom, guys?
Hi, mom!
I'm home, mom!
Were you changing the briquette?
I'll do it, mom!
So thanks to that, she bought twenty more!
At this rate, we'll be travelling the world in no time!
Right?
Here's hot water.
Bon appetite, mom.
I made you some sauteed beef, your favorite.
Make sure you eat all of it.
Don't let it go bad.
There, there!
Come on.
You cry so much, just like my mom!
I'm the one who should thank you.
When I come visit you I feel like I'm seeing my mom.
I told you.
My mom couldn't speak either.
You can hold my hands for as long as you want.
Only doctors hold your hands when you get old.
What are you saying?
Are you saying that I have to cut off one breast?
Yeah.
But you can always get a breast implant later.
But what's the need at your age?
Have you sobered up?
What am I going to do?
Mom?
Let's step out for a second.
- This can't be happening.
- She's your mom?
How hilarious!
Phone.
Off.
What?
What are you doing?
If anything ever happens to my mom
I'll carve out your nipples.
Both of them.
Got it?
Yes.
Why does your grandma drink coffee in a cup like this?
Mom, what are these fish called?
Golden Tetra.
They glow more than before.
They glow more as they get older.
Do people glow more as they get older?
Ask your grandma that.
She's a blinding star.
I'm just a dull ordinary person.
- You're home early.
- Hi grandma.
- What is it?
- This is bullshit.
Fire me?
Professor HANG Hee-Kyoung?
This can't happen!
I won't let it!
I won't!
Mom, is grandma crazy?
She's just very angry right now.
I won't have that surgery.
I'm scared to get sliced up.
I don't want to be a breastless woman.
Over my dead body.
You know mom...
Modern technology is so developed these days.
They can even turn a black person into a white person.
It'll be over in the blink of an eye.
Another blink, and you'll have a new breast.
So there's nothing you have to worry about!
What are you saying?
That I'll be uneven?
Why would you be uneven?
They'll make you a new one!
No!
I'll be uneven!
I can't even go to the sauna anymore!
That's what you're worried about?
I'm uneven!
No more sauna!
I'm uneven!
What's this?
From that fall?
Ow...
- Thank you, Dong-sook.
- No problem.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
I put the food back in the fridge.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Oh my god!
Dong-sook!
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
Dong-sook!
Wake up!
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
- I'm okay.
- What's wrong?
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay to stand?
Two months?
Even with the surgery?
The surgery won't heal you.
It'll just give you more time.
It's also possible you won't make it through the surgery.
Doctor, I am very healthy.
Even now, I don't feel any pain.
Ovarian cancer is usually symptomless.
Regular check-up is the only way to prevent it.
You're a bit too late.
This can't be.
I can't be sick.
My son has Duchen's muscular dystrophy.
He can live for five more years.
I have to be with him.
We're supposed to go on a world trip.
If you want, you can get a second opinion elsewhere.
Would my results be any different?
I don't think so.
Sir.
You can't say this to me.
What about my son, then?
- Please calm down.
- I can't die.
Just five more years, doctor.
What about my son?
Please help me.
Please doctor.
Don't do this, doctor.
Let's just calm down.
Wait.
Please.
I was so beautiful.
When did time pass by so fast?
Oh my!
Deok-soo!
Deok-soo!
Mom!
Where are you, mom?
Mom!
I got something for you!
Look at this, mom.
I bought you all this from the department store!
Luxury bath lotion, your favorite!
I also have this sparkly thing!
I'm serious!
Get up and take a look!
Why even bother?
They're all useless anyway!
Come on, mom!
Geez!
Mom.
Let's just do it.
Get your surgery.
Then I'll do whatever you wish.
You think you're Buddha?
Well no, but I would do anything for my mom.
I would even split the earth in two if you asked me to.
So tell me everything you want.
It's not that I want something.
Okay?
But there is someone I want to see.
Who, mom?
Go on, say it!
Someone from my youth.
My first love.
First love?
I was nineteen years old.
Your grandma asked me to bring a sack of rice flour.
I was on my way home struggling with the heavy thing.
I'd skipped lunch and my shoulder was killing me.
Just then a man came and took my rice flour sack.
He was the second son of the distillery shop family.
He was tall and handsome
And strong!
All girls in the village were crazy about him.
And of all girls, he chose me!
I felt so lucky!
He taught me how to sing.
He rode me on his bike
And made me flower rings.
Before he went to Seoul to study
Everyday felt like a dream.
I' m sorry I'm late.
Looking back...
It was the most exciting day of my life.
Did you call me, boss?
Yeah.
You're good with films?
- Pardon me?
- Films.
- You mean movies?
- Look.
You playing smart?
Movies or films or whatever.
Do you feel that good when you pretend to be that smart?
You have this thing about being uneducated.
- I'm sorry, boss.
- It's an inferiority complex.
I'm sorry, sir.
We're gonna make a mellow film.
Find me an actor.
JANG HEE-KYOUNG QUEEN OF OPERA
Mom!
Mom!
Mom.
What are you doing?
Are you okay?
You know how I got this far?
You're gonna get wrinkles if you keep on crying like that.
And your hair.
It's like a metal sponge.
It'll be okay, mom.
Don't cry.
- Dong-hee?
- Hi, sis.
What's up?
Hey!
Sang-hoon!
- Dong-hee?
- Yeah?
I have something to tell you.
What is it?
- Sang-hoon!
- Dong-hee...
Sang-hoon!
I said come here!
Sorry, sis.
Sang-hoon's made a mess.
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.
- Sorry, okay?
- Okay.
Shit, man.
Cheers!
The men here are good.
What the?
It's your first time at this cabaret, isn't it?
Yes.
I couldn't help noticing you when I was singing.
Is your name 'Ok' by any chance?
No, sorry.
- Get over here!
- Have a beer.
Where is he, bitch?
- Honey!
Please!
- Is it that asshole?
Come here, you old fart!
Please stop it!
What are you waiting for?
Bring him here before he gets beat up.
Yes boss!
Honey!
I can't believe my mother fell for such a loser.
Damn it!
So.
You're Ok-joo's son?
Yeah.
Are you sure you're HANG Deok-soo?
I know it's been a long time but how can you turn out like that?
She sure raised a good son.
Let me repeat.
I got it.
So you want me to put on a show?
With my looks, I can pass for a doctor or a lawyer.
Or even a CEO.
So just tell me what you need.
I'm a pro at things like this.
By the way.
How much will you pay me?
You'll give me enough, right?
You ever tried human meat?
We have a lot of meat.
A lot of human meat.
We'll give it to you if you want it.
Money or meat or whatever!
You'd better be damn convincing!
I'll skin you alive if you screw up!
Wrinkles and all!
Got it!
Okay!
Let's do it!
Yeah?
Mom?
What else would I be doing?
I'm teaching.
Hello, every baby!
Miss me already?
You want cabbage fritters?
Why here, of all places?
It's freezing.
It's your first time to come outside like this.
Here.
- Drink this, grandma.
- No.
Just a bit!
- Yuck!
- Yuck!
Let's try to have fun since we're here.
I'll put on some music.
How's my singing?
People will hate you if you sing like that.
Close your eyes and feel the music.
Be confident.
What's that?
Like this.
Wow!
Our special guest today is Kim Yoon-ji the remarkable soprano singer from the musical Loveholic.
Hello?
- Hello.
- Leave it.
Your role was originally sung by JANG Hee-Kyoung, right?
Right.
I think the musical was too challenging for Professor JANG with her age and all.
I'm hoping that I can sing better than her.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Twenty-three.
Hi, it's me.
You said you knew the chairman of Haklim Foundation?
- Where are you going, mom?
- Can I see him right now?
What about the car?
I'll be right there.
Mom!
Hello!
This place might look slummy
But it's the only place in Seoul that has cabbage fritters.
Right.
Deok-soo was an eloquent man.
It was tough finding this place.
Do they taste like in the old days?
May be he's become a judge.
I'm not sure about these fritters.
What would you like loser, I mean... that man to have become?
It's not really what I want.
This is just my own imagination.
Knowing how bold and smart he was maybe he's become a successful businessman.
What do you want to do when you meet him?
What would we do at this age?
Just eat something delicious.
Something delicious.
Talk about the old days.
Go sing a song at a karaoke.
Watch a movie in a theater.
- Hey KOO!
Long time no see!
- Eat an egg at a sauna.
Go up Namsan Tower and sightsee Seoul.
by the old palace.
We can head to the river when the sun is about to set
And go on a ferry.
Honey, this is like a dream come true!
So tell me again.
This says that Deoksoo is coming to see me from America, right?
I told you.
It says right here.
- So Mom!
- Yes?
You have to get the surgery.
I'm worried.
What if he doesn't even recognize me anymore because I'm too old?
No way.
Why did time have to pass by so fast, damn it?
Aren't you going to the gym?
Smart kids these days sing and dance so well.
Wait til she sprains her back.
- Hi there!
- Yeah.
- Hi!
- Going somewhere?
Zip me up?
- Where are you going?
- To practice.
Practice?
I'm back on.
Get ready.
5 minutes.
HANG Hee-Kyoung.
You're a coward.
- I'm not done peeling.
- What?
Do you really have to do that?
What's it to you?
You already have everything.
You should learn to let things go.
How can you have such endless greed?
What do you mean I have everything?
Leave it!
Who told you to touch that?
Then what about you?
Don't you have any ambitions?
I hired you so you won't starve.
But you have no talent nor ambitions.
Where you going?
Stay and listen!
You're just a servant for your husband and kid.
What's your dream?
Did you even have one?
Why don't you answer that?
What's her goal?
- What does she want to do?
- I wanted to sing!
I wanted to be a singer!
So is your mom coming?
Way to go, Eun-sung!
Do your best.
# Before I knew it
# Wrinkles filled my forehead
# Oh my!
Please!
# Let me be young again.
# Before I knew it
Mom!
Mom!
How vulgar!
I couldn't sing after that.
So I gave up.
I hated my mother who was embarrassed of me.
So I did everything to despise you.
Vulgarly I got married to an older guy right after high school.
Vulgarly I had a baby right away.
Vulgarly I became your maid.
You're asking such a vulgar person about her dreams?
You have a husband, child and mother.
You have everything.
Don't you feel sorry for your mother who has nothing but a voice?
Don't blame me.
You wanna sing?
You think singing is a joke because you see me sing every day?
Well, let's listen to you.
Sing.
I felt sorry for you these days.
I liked being next to you and consoling you.
But I was wrong.
You're hopeless.
Now I understand why dad cheated on you.
So that's why you married a loser like your dad and completely infuriate your mother?
Sing?
Let's hear you sing.
Music?
Don't you dare insult it!
Dad, I have to poo.
Let's poo.
What a nice surprise!
You're taking me out!
Look, mom!
That store's still there!
- Look, sweetie!
- Look at the bubbles!
Take this.
What's this?
- Vitamin.
- Vitamin?
It's so nice being out, isn't it?
Sweetie?
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
For what?
Everything.
Don't do it again then.
I'm so sleepy mom.
I slept a lot before coming out.
Let me give you a piggy back.
- Wanna play rhyming game?
- Okay.
Elope.
Cope.
Mope.
Grope.
Slope.
Pope.
Rope.
Hope.
I like the word hope.
So I put it on my wall.
Hope will never abandon you.
It's you who abandons hope.
Mom.
Let's go home.
I'm so sleepy.
Okay.
Let's go home.
Let's live.
We'll be okay, baby.
Let's go home.
Mom!
Mom!
Are you sleeping?
- Are you home, baby?
- Yeah.
- Are you sick?
- No
Then what's wrong?
You're meeting Deok-soo in a few days.
You'll have a wonderful date.
I'm not gonna meet him.
Yeah right.
Why not?
I hate everything.
What's wrong?
Did you eat dinner?
What the?
Look at me.
Look, mom!
Let's see you, mom!
What?
What's wrong with your face?
Out of my way!
Move, idiot!
Where's the doctor?
- I need a doctor!
- What's the matter?
Come this way.
Why is she here?
I don't know what she did but look at her face.
- Look at her!
- Let's see your face, ma'am!
Let's see your face!
It's okay, mom!
Did you burn yourself?
Is your face burnt?
- No.
- Huh?
I uh...
What?
What did you do?
Botox!
What's Botox?
Botox...
- Put ointment on her.
- Okay.
Are you mad?
No, I'm not mad.
Yes you are mad!
I'm not.
Let's go.
You are.
I said I'm not.
Come on!
No.
Are you mad, mom?
Here.
I'll give you a piggy back.
No.
- You are mad again?
- No.
- Piggy back, mom!
- That's okay.
Just get on my back.
It's okay.
- Happy?
- Yes.
Happy.
Geez, mom!
You almost scared me to death!
- Really?
- Yeah.
They said you'll be okay after the treatment tomorrow.
- So don't you worry.
- Okay.
- I'm not mad by the way.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.
- You are!
I'm not!
- Mom.
- Yeah?
I'm so happy I have you.
I'm so happy I have you, son.
- Really?
- Really.
I'm so glad!
- How do you feel, mom?
- Good!
- Good?
- Yeah!
- Then sing me a song!
- What?
On the streets?
That's so classless!
But you'll do it anyway, right?
How did you know?
One Two Three Four!
Samba samba samba samba!
My dear love!
Samba, samba, samba, samba!
Be happy and smile as much as possible.
Watch what you eat.
Fight lethargy with light exercise.
Of course, doctor.
I'm getting better.
I'm getting better.
The key is to stay positive.
I'd like to book a flight for two to Paris.
When would you like to leave?
April 29th.
It's my son's birthday.
I'm all better.
Here comes the cake!
Happy birthday, Sang-hoon!
I want to blow out the candles after him!
You're not a baby!
- It's kimbap!
- You're six already!
Can you get me kimchi, please?
Kimchi?
We have to get some out.
We ate it all.
- You do it.
- Come on...
My back aches.
- Okay.
- Thanks!
It's the one in front of the door, right?
Yeah.
Your kimchi is the best!
Where is it, sis?
Second container on the right platform!
I'll be back.
I'm coming!
Eat, guys!
- Wait!
- Here, let me see too!
You can see Paris and New York!
What is it?
- Wait!
- Show me!
You're blocking it!
Dong-sook!
I um...
You know...
You know...
You said You know 1 3 times.
You know, I'm...
Sick?
A lot?
More than me?
But you can fight it, right?
Of course.
I can fight it.
It's nothing.
YOU'RE A STAR OF TOMORROW!
Where are you?
Do what you want.
Follow your dreams.
Or you'll regret it.
I'm on your side.
By the way
Did your dad have square jaw line too?
Hi sweetie!
We found mom!
Hi.
Um...
I'd like to audition.
CLASS CANCELLED
Let's record your mom.
Way to go, Mom!
Oh Penny!
Please take me the way I am!
Am I that revolting?
Revolting?
These are my savings.
Sis.
Everything will be alright.
I know.
PRESCRIPTION
I'm just here to get Yeon-doo's book.
Come give me a massage.
I'm in pain.
You do have strong hands.
# I'm crazy.
Crazy just for you!
What a freak show.
Come back to work.
I need you.
It's not my style to take the taxi.
- Do you have a cold?
- Yeah, a bit.
Are you crazy?
Do you know how important this concert is?
It'll be the end of me if I get a cold.
How can you be so thoughtless?
Go home!
What's your child to you?
I mean What am I to you?
You don't know how the world runs.
This isn't just about me.
It's about the whole concert.
You're right, I don't know.
Then shut up and go home.
Hurry!
You're a nasty woman.
What?
I'm going on that audition you just saw on TV.
I'm gonna go on it and humiliate you.
Yeah right you will.
Stay right there!
Don't you feel sorry for your mom?
I feel sorry for myself!
I feel sorry that I have a mother like you!

Hello?
Who is this?
Excuse me.
I'm supposed to meet Dr. HIN in Gynecology here.
- Have you seen him?
- No, sorry.
Dr. HIN!
Doctor!
Where is Won-jae?
Is he hurt?
He's fine.
He came to see me this morning on my way to work.
Begging me to save your life.
Doctor, please save my mom.

Save my mom!
I don't want my mom to die!
Please don't let her die.
Mom.

Hmm?
Tuna!
How about in Italy?
Beef.
My little boy!
What do I call you?

You're so cute when you smile.
Sweetie!
Close your eyes.
Mommy's face.
Mommy's forehead.
Mommy's eyebrow.
Eyes.
Smile.
I'll be coming home smiling like this.
It's cold out.
Don't come here again.
Okay?
- You trust me, right?
- Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
My little puppy.
Baby, we have a problem.
Grandma's concert and mom's audition are both tomorrow.
What should we do?
Simple.
I go to Mom, you go to Grandma.
How about the other way around?
No.
No fair.
They'll both do well, right?
But what if I don't go tomorrow?
Dead.
I'm dead, right?
Do you like me or that game?
- You.
- Thanks.
You're so lucky you're young.
Sorry?
Your mother must be beautiful.
Your skin is so soft!
It's good to be young!
You know concert's tomorrow, right?
Don't be late.
Got it?
I'm so lucky I don't have a daughter.
Really really lucky.
Look who's calling!
Hello, my dear son!
Shopping again?
You just bought me last week!
Don't buy anything.
What a bitch!
Sir?
- Hmm?
- Just one more day.
- Do I look good?
- Of course you do!
You probably couldn't sleep well last night.
Sleep a bit in the car.
No way!
What if my face gets all puffy?
It's Mr. LEE.
Hold on.
- Hi, Mr. LEE!
- We have a problem, boss.
Yeong-man's boys got the old man.
What?
- Did they take him?
- Yes, boss.
He wants you to come to Juliana Club.
I'm sorry, boss.
I'll be there.
Get the boys there too.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Are we there already?
No.
Um...
It looks like the plane will be delayed.
What?
What do we do, then?
It won't be delayed too much.
Actually...
Your hair style is strange today.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Why did you do that?
- It looks bad?
- Yeah.
Really?
Oh.
Shoot.
It is a bit strange.
Okay!
I'll redo it!
Great idea, mom!
Let me just go to school quickly.
Okay.
KIM Young-man!
Welcome.
What the hell are you doing?
Me?
I'm just having fun with your mother's first love.
Why are you shaking?
Cold or scared?
What do you want?
Is it me?
Take your shot.
KOO Seung-chul.
Hey, KOO!

Five!
- Boss!
- Come here, you son of a bitch!
Get that old man!
I said get that old man!

You're up?
Did you have breakfast?
I'm going in for surgery now.

Why the sad voice?

HOPE
PLEASE DO NOT BE LATE FOR YOUR AUDITION
Are you scared, mom?
No.
I know but what can I do?
All the parents are begging ne so I can't refuse.
You're in good hands with Mr. LEE.
Just relax and enjoy your date, mom.
Okay.
It's too bad but what can we do.
It's not your fault you're the most popular English teacher.
Thanks mom.
You're the best.
Have a great time, mom.
Ouch.
Aren't you coming?
Wanna see my mom pass out?
I'm so sorry.
We've planned everything perfectly so don't screw up.
I'll be watching you.
I am the king of acting.
Don't you worry.
Yeah right.
Mom...
I miss you...
Two hours to dress rehearsal.
Yes, sir.
I'll be right there.
Who is it?
I'm cheering for you, Mrs. HANG!
I knew you'd come.
Get Eun-sung to get me a bottle of mineral water.
She's gone for the audition.
What?
She really went?
Yes, as far as I know.
Where's my cell?
She probably can't pick up.
Why not?
She should be in the middle of her audition.
I'm going on that audition you just saw on TV.
I'm gonna go on it and humiliate you.
- Go start the car
- Pardon?
- Hurry!
- Your flower
- Now!
- Yes, ma'am
I'm so nervous.
Hi, dad.
Okay.
# Please forgive me.
# Come back I beg you.
Thank you.
Pretty good.
You don't have a solid base.
You seem fake.
Souless.
Sol.
Do Re Mi Fa Sol.
PARK Eun-sung, you're next.
Okay.
Let the film roll.
Que!
- Ok-joo.
- Deok-soo.
You're not him.
It can't be.
It's me, Deok-soo.
- Who are you?
- HANG Deok-soo.
- Massage here.
- Yes, sir.
Are you okay?
Hey.
Which restaurant did you reserve?
The best one in Seoul.
We ordered a full course meal.
- How about the theater?
- Theater, Karaoke, Sauna.
We've rented them all.
Well done.
Now it's all up to that old fart.
It was a busy morning.
I'm feeling hungry now..
It's not very nice out, is it?
Are you cold?
Should we get you something to put on?
But my son always takes me shopping.
Actually... there's somewhere I really want to go.
Where might that be?
Hey!
Come quickly!
Get in!
Don't get in that, mom!
Damn it!
We're headed down a rough path.
- Quick!
Get in!
- Yes, boss.
Move out of the way
A bike is coming!
This place might look slummy but they have the best cabbage fritters in Seoul.
It's been a while since you've had this, right?
I had reserved the best restaurant in Seoul!
My son is so good to me.
He found these places for me.
Thanks for noticing, mom.
Oh yeah!
Did I tell you my son is a popular English teacher?
I knew that!
He's doing very well!
What?
Have you met my son?
No, not exactly.
I meant, that's what I've heard from others.
I see.
I'll tell you what.
Let's go see my son teach English.
He speaks English so well!
His work's not far from here.
Why, mom?
Actually...
Why would I want to meet your son?
You're right.
Let's not spoil this.
Let's go for coffee somewhere.
Where you going now?
Don't you worry.
You'll be alright.
See you soon, okay?
Auntie!
Where's mom?
How about me?
It's hot!
Be careful!
Don't burn yourself!
- It's roasted well!
- Hot!
Damn it!
Where the heck are they?
They got here 1 5 minutes ago and gulped down their coffee.
They circled this area twice.
Answer my question.
Where are they?
This way.
Spread out!
Yes, boss
Stick close to them and tell me what they're saying.
Yes, boss
Wait a moment, sir.
Here I go.
Ok-joo, how are you feeling today?
I can't describe it.
I was an old fart living a dull life.
But thanks to you
I feel like I'm in heaven now.
Did my mom just say that she was living a dull life?
Are you delivering this correctly?
Yes, sir.
Look, dumbass.
Just tell me what they're saying minus the emotions.
You're giving me goose bumps.
I thought you might find this useful.
- Ok-joo.
- It's nothing expensive.
Would you...
Like to come with me?
Sorry?
Sorry?
What the hell's he up to?
Shit.
My life-long wish was ...to see you before I die.
Oh my god.
You still had this after all these years.
But after seeing you like this
I don't think I can live without you.
I don't think I can live without you.
Oh, Deok-soo
Boss!
Hey!
Hey!
You know...
I've led a bad life.
My life's been a real mess.
But I think that if I can just be with you
I...
I can live a decent life like everyone else.
Really...
Can I...
Can I really go with you?
Would you?
Won-jae.
Your mom won't be out for awhile.
Let's go and have lunch.
We have to stay strong for your mom.
It's okay.
I'll eat with my mom later.
Then I'll go out and get something to eat.
Stay here.
Hurry up!
- KANG Eun-sung?
- Yes?
- You're a housewife?
- Yes.
Are you.
- No.
- Sorry?
I'm not.
Weren't you a back dancer before?
Right.
I danced on the back stage.
Let's be quick.
I have a cold coming.
This is so sweet!
Is there a particular reason why you're here?
I've wanted to sing since I was young.
Why are you auditioning so late?
Because of my mother.
As a married woman it must've been hard to get here.
Why do you want to start singing?
- Because of my mother.
- Bitch!
Mommy!
Mommy!
You're right.
You should sing well just like your famous mother.
Your mother is HANG Hee-kyoung the soprano singer, right?
- HANG Hee-Kyoung?
- From the musical Loveholic?
You're going to be singing a pop music, not classical!
I'm really looking forward to this.
Let's see how you compare to your mother, the best soprano singer in the country!
In the breeze...
Thank you.
Ma'am?
Come.
I guess you're nervous.
You're so unlike your proud mother!
Your mother never had problems being cruel to others!
That asshole!
Let's hear it again!
What's the need?
I said I have a cold.
I told you no to do it.
Thank you.
The exit's on your left.
I wanted to sing!
I wanted to be a singer!
Hey!
KANG Eun-sung!
Grab that microphone.
# In the breeze
# I can here love calling
# The love that left me
When darkness fades and tomorrow comes.
This is your story.
Focus on the lyrics.
Close your eyes and be confident!
- Let's go, mom!
- You can do it, hon!
# When darkness fades # and tomorrow comes
# My past days of longing
You're great!
# Just might come back
# Come back to me slowly
# I won't cry anymore
# It hurts to say goodbye.
# Even if I leave again
# I'll give you all my love.
Everyone together!
# I can't remember
# But I can't forget
# The longing when sadness passes
# Even when time passes
# Stay by my side
# Just like now and forever.
# Like now and forever.
She's glowing!
How vulgar!
Thank you.
You're coming with me?
Yes.
In next life.
Your son will get married and leave you.
Someday you'll have to live your own life.
I'll do anything for you.
You know I married a lowlife loser
And got beat up all my life.
I died over and over again.
You know who saved me?
My son.
To me,
My son is my guardian.
I..
I can never leave my guardian.
Son, you make me so happy.
Mom, you make me so happy, too.
Forehead.
Eyes.
Then...
Smile.
Surprise!
I thought you might be alone right now.
I'm taking my surgery very well.
So please keep your smile!
And pray for me.
I love you.
Hope shows magic to its beholder.
HOPE
HOPE WILL COME TRUE.
BELIEVE IT, WON-JAE!
HOPE
EVERYTHING COMES FROM HOPE.
CHEER UP, SWEETIE.
Hi there.
I'm the yogurt delivery lady.
Long time no see.
I've been a bit sick so I'm getting a surgery.
The doctor says that I could die.
But he's wrong.
I know I'm going to fight through it.
Why?
Because I have to keep my promise with my son who is fighting muscular dystrophy.
My son is just 11 years old.
He 's not even able to come to the hospital.
He 's alone, probably praying desperately for his mom.
Please help him fight through this.
All he needs is your message of hope.
Hope is his favorite word.
Those messages and your energy will protect my son and I believe they'll save me.
I'm going to make through this.
I have to.
I have no other choice.
HOPE COMES TO THOSE WHO DREAM.
STAY STRONG FOR YOUR MOM, WON-JAE!
YOUR MOTHER WILL GET BETTER.
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
Because I'm a mother.
Mom?
I don't like Edelweiss.
It's so outdated!
Edelweiss is the fundamental of music!
You need a strong base.
And here!
Every morning you greet me
It's not just greet me here.
It's greet me with a strong t' sound.
Got it?
From the beginning.
Nice.
Let's go.
# Edelweiss, # edelweiss
# Every morning you greet me.
Hear it?
She's someone I just can't hate.
- # Samba, samba, samba, samba!
- # Samba!
- # My dancing queen - # Queen
# Samba, samba, samba
She's someone I thank for just being alive.
Breakfast, sweetie!
Come on, get up!
I'm gonna eat all of your favorite fish!
- I'm sleepy!
- One, two, three!
She's the strongest person in the universe!

"You've been getting too much fortune.
Please give me some of that!"
"That's why I want this area.
But you're too big headed!

So how is it?
Do you want to drink blood, or you prefer water?
As for me... lt'll be blood!
Are your hungy?
- Let's eat!
"Jai, I need to have a word...
- Just spill it then."
What's with this?
So you're planning to syphon all those loan sharks' money now?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I prefer this way...than having to beg.
And I know how to settle those debts.
Why can't you just get a regular work to earn money?
If you are in trouble, you should have come to me.
Why can't you just get a regular work to earn money?
If you are in trouble, you should have come to me.
I think it's better for you to help Mom than me.
I know how to take care of myself.
It's also impossible for those big shots to come and kill me.
Jai, you should respect your elder brother.
You should be afraid of me!
Please do not inte_ere.
This is a family affair.
Relax, I'm on your side now.
Why are you still hanging around with this fool?

"Do you know about my past histoy when I was in prison due to murder?" Why are you still hanging around with this fool?

No one dared to touch me when I was there.
Therefore, I'm still a 'virgin'.

I can't say much to you anymore Jai.. .
But please remember our Mom for a change.
I can't say much to you anymore Jai.. .
But please remember our Mom for a change.
Jai Ho!
Do you know the song?
You should think about your family sometime!
Take that!
And get lost!
Malik...wait a second!
"Just look at what he'd done to my face?
It's my dignity we're talking about here!"
Luckily that you got it from Jai and not me!
"Just look at what he'd done to my face?

You're 'exhaust' has been too loud.. .
Luckily that you got it from Jai and not me!
You're 'exhaust' has been too loud.. .
What do you mean?
Do you know that this 'exhaust' has brought a lot of girls to me?
!
But were they girls or ape?
I think they were apes!
You better watch your mouth Malik!
Do you know that Siti Saleha is now clinging onto me like a magnet?
But I said no!
Do you know that Siti Saleha is now clinging onto me like a magnet?
But I said no!
I'd like you to bring me to a hospital now... my vision seems distorted.
What's Siti Saleha's relevance into our stoy here?
You claim to have been in prison for murder, right?
Therefore, a tough guy like you shouldn't go to hospitals.
How long do you guys want to become slaves?
I'm curious, what has Alex done to you?
You owe us money, yet you have the guts to be here?
!
Bro, tell your brother here that this is just a problem between us.
"lf you don't want any trouble, you have to settle the debt tonight, or else!"
Well, you did ask for this, right?
And don't forget to wash yourself later.. .
or the devil might come for you.
I bumped into Jai earlier.. .
He said he will settle those debts soon.
And asked us not to wory.
He sends his regards to you Mom.. .
and he said sory.
It's ok Malik. I'm sure he has his reasons for his actions.
We don't really know about his actual problem anmay, right?
But Abang Jai seems to be making debts eve_here.
He likes to create problems.
And he never tries to change.
Can't you teach him a lesson?
Believe me I've tried.
"Using force him won't solve this either, furthermore he's big headed!"
That's enough Malik.
"Using force him won't solve this either, furthermore he's big headed!"
That's enough Malik.
I don't want my sons to become enemies.
That's enough Malik.
I don't want my sons to become enemies.
And you still have to respect your brother Jai.
But we can't lust ignore this?
"And eveyone here already know that Abang Jai is stuck with lots of debts!"
"His pictures are pasted eve_here across town, I feel so ashamed!" "And eveyone here already know that Abang Jai is stuck with lots of debts!"
"His pictures are pasted eve_here across town, I feel so ashamed!"
Just let it be.
We've been on our own all these while anmay.
I don't want this to make us hate each other.
Let's pray for him.
You've ambushed King's place.
You'll have a bigger territoy now.
More money for you I'm sure!
If I don't enhance my power, you won't be here either.
But I'm not done yet. I want him to sink!
If I don't enhance my power, you won't be here either.

What else do you want?

I'm not yet satisfied. I need eveyone to bow to me!
But you have crossed the line.
"Do you know that this might cause us to But you have crossed the line.
"Do you know that this might cause us to become enemies with the other gang leaders."
You think?
!
Let's wait and see who dares to fight me!
The other groups seem useless anmay.
Just follow my orders, or you might regret it!
Why do you want to meet me here?
What's so urgent?
Yes!
Have you settled with Tailong?
Why do you want to meet me here?
What's so urgent?

I am planning to get the place back.
What?
Just let King deal with that.
You shouldn't inte_ere.

What?
Just let King deal with that.
You shouldn't inte_ere.
Tailong started this.
You want King to fight him alone?
I can't lust sit back and watch.
Do you think King can defeat Tailong?
Today, me and King are meeting the other gang leaders.. .
We need to destroy Tailong.
If you think you can defeat Tailong.. .
I don't care who dies!
But I don't want you to die, because I still love my son!
Give way, please!
You think our boss dares to fire a gangster like me?
!
"You must remember that I'm here because I want to accompany you!"
This is not my kind of life with all these car parts.
My life is not about engine oil.
It's always about blood.
Blood?
Stop ioking!
Please do not bring that matter up!
Oh no!
My boys are here!
Wait for me ok!
Hey King!
"How are you?
- l'm still the same.
Still working hard to make ends meet."
"l wish I can be as rich as you with more business sense up my sleeves." - l'm still the same.
Still working hard to make ends meet."
"l wish I can be as rich as you with more business sense up my sleeves."
Well, we need to be a fighter too to survive, like you.
What's the stoy King?
Are you in trouble?
Well, we need to be a fighter too to survive, like you.
What's the stoy King?
Are you in trouble?
Yes, there are some problems.
You know Tailong right?
"Our areas have been attacked by Tailong.
Our businesses are ruined by him now." Yes, there are some problems.
You know Tailong right?
"Our areas have been attacked by Tailong.
Our businesses are ruined by him now."
We're in trouble now.
"Our areas have been attacked by Tailong.
Our businesses are ruined by him now."
We're in trouble now.
Therefore we're here to tell you update all these.
But aren't all these your regular 'diet', King?
He's not a regular guy.
Even my boys can't fight him.
A few have been killed by him as well.
"Nobody seems to be able to defeat him.
He's as tough as you!
A few have been killed by him as well.
"Nobody seems to be able to defeat him.
He's as tough as you!
- So do you want me to fight him?"
"l don't think I want to be involved, because it might get me in trouble as well."
But you've got us to protect you, bro!
because it might get me in trouble as well."
But you've got us to protect you, bro!
I pledge my life to you on this!
Let's destroy Tailong!
Malik, I really need you to loin us.
You're the only hope we've got!
No one else can defeat him!
You're the only hope we've got!
No one else can defeat him!
I've known you since schooling days, King.. .
But in this gangster business, I don't think I can help you.
Rrr...remind me if you need a hit man.. .
Mom, please don't think too much about Abang Jai.
I'm sure Abang Malik knows how to handle the matter.
Furthermore, if you over-think this, you might get sick.
"Actually I never thought that Jai would turn out to be just like your father."
Your father was lust like this.. .
He owes money to people eve_here.
There'll always be people looking for him evey day.
Until finally, he left all of us just like that.
Maybe this is my fault because I fail to become a good parent.
Don't blame yourself.
It's not your fault.. .
It's Dad's fault
How could he lust leave us like that?
Maybe this is just one of God's ways to test us.
But I'm lust sad that my children have never felt the love of a father.
What you've done lust now.. .
I think you've just disappointed our big gangster brother.
I'm sure he'll scold us for this.
I'm a mean hit man as well.
But sadly I'm penniless.
Life is so unfair!
If I only care about money. I would have joined King a long time ago.
But you still have to help us, and help his business.
Sadly, he's no fighter.
With our fighting combination, Tailong will surely be afraid of us!
We're blood brothers!
Even if I don't help Kind, you are still my blood brother.
You guys are blood brothers!
But with me, we're bloody fools!
Bukit Bintang, Jinjang, and now Petaling Street.. .
Tailong has them all.
Soon he'll be coming for your territories as well.
Wherever he wants to conquer, that's his business.
If you're not influential enough, and you don't negotiate with him.. .
"He'll surely eat you up as well!
- What are you talking about Jackie?"
"No matter how big the influence is, one shouldn't go and terrorize others."
Bangkok, Philippines... he's got them in his network already.
We know that you're the only one who dares to confront him.
Bangkok, Philippines... he's got them in his network already.
We know that you're the only one who dares to confront him.
Even if it's the Columbian gangster, I couldn't care less.
Kalimuthu and Botak Chin also kiss their mothers' hands.
Tailong has bought all of you, that's why you obey him.
We're all the same fish in the same pond..
Tailong is roaming freely among us.
I'm afraid he'll destroy us in the end.
Will you be paying or not?
!
Or you'll die!
Mom!
"l feel like seeing ghosts, I really don't know where to go anymore."
I'm afraid that we might end up in ICU sometime.. .
"l feel like seeing ghosts, I really don't know where to go anymore."
I'm afraid that we might end up in ICU sometime.. .
What can he do to us anmay?
Even if he upgrades his skills, he is still no match for me.
"l just want to know which soldier he'll be sending ne_.
- You're lust too cocky!"
"What if he sends in a big team, we'll be sitting ducks!
- You're lust too cocky!"
"What if he sends in a big team, we'll be sitting ducks!
I think we should lust return their money" "What if he sends in a big team, we'll be sitting ducks!
I think we should lust return their money"
"Well, you guys agreed to do this business earlier, right?
Without money, how can we do business?"
Once we have money, lust repay them back.
"Now I know where you got the money from.
It's from Dragon, right?" Once we have money, lust repay them back.
"Now I know where you got the money from.
It's from Dragon, right?"
The whole town knows him.
Are you out of your mind?
!
"Now I know where you got the money from.
It's from Dragon, right?"
The whole town knows him.
Are you out of your mind?
!
"That's only one town.
This is me, Jai - the whole of Malaysia knows me!"
He doesn't care about small matters like this.
"That's only one town.
This is me, Jai - the whole of Malaysia knows me!"
He doesn't care about small matters like this.
Jai!
"Those guys you bashed yesterday, they've just attacked your home!"
You're too young for this dark world, Malik. I told you so
You're not Jackie Chan or Tony Ja, unlike me, Malik.
But do not wory Malik, I'll take care of your family, especially Zati.
But do not wory Malik, I'll take care of your family, especially Zati.
I promise you I'll be a good husband to her.
And you should be proud
"since you have a respectable person like me as your brother in law.."
Rest in peace Malik.. .
What are you mumbling about?
Where's my Mom?
In which ward is my Mom?
Her name sir?
Are you ok Mom?
I'm fine.
It's just a bump in the head, probably due to the fall.
The doctor has asked us to run CT and mri.
I'm fine.
It's just a bump in the head, probably due to the fall.
The doctor has asked us to run CT and mri.
I'm vey worried about you.
Do not wory, I should be fine.
She needs to go.
Let's meet later.
We've met all the big heads.
Only Deva wants to defend us.
The rest are following Tailong.
"lf you can't protect your own place, you should just give it to Tailong."
No need for fighting then.
"lf you can't protect your own place, you should just give it to Tailong."
No need for fighting then.
"lt's not easy for us to be on top, we shouldn't just hand it over like that."
"While we're around, we can't just let him do whatever he wants."
We must stop to him!
Well, he has taken all of King's areas one by one.
Will you stop only when you're dead?
Well, he has taken all of King's areas one by one.
Will you stop only when you're dead?
The big gangsters are having a feast!
When I allow you to use your hands, please use them properly.
Don't let me take them off from you!
And you have to let your dogs feed you instead.
You come to our place and act so cocky, are you crazy?
"You want all of King' territories, why?
You come to our place and act so cocky, are you crazy?
"You want all of King' territories, why?
And I don't want to see your face evey day."
You've got all the areas.
What else do you want Tailong?
And I don't want to see your face evey day."
You've got all the areas.
What else do you want Tailong?
Please respect me and my family!
I respected you, and you planned something against me.
Do you think I'm a fool?
"And you sneaked around my back.
You asked the other heads to plot against me?"
But too bad, the presentation wasn't great.
Neither was your presentation!
You're lust rotten!
So when was the last time you took a shower?
!
"Hey!
You shouldn't become a gangster!
Go work at a petrol pump instead!"
And King...which fool wants to help you now?
Do you think by acting like this, you can gain control?
Be afraid of my sword!
"l will also make sure that you'll suffer!
- You think?
Come do it now!"
Remember that this face will take your life soon!
You think I'm afraid with the gangs from BricMields?
I won't even hide myself from the Yakuza.
Ok, let's see what you can do to me!
"Hey!
Why are you showing off now in front of my family!
I don't want to get myself dirty now."
This is not the time for a fight with me!
King, I see that all your dogs have grown up.
But when I look at your wife... I've gotten the results for the CT and mri scan.
Apparently there's a tumour in your mother's brain.
As at now she can still rely on medication.
"But I recommend you to proceed with an operation soon, as the cancer might spread."
Sister, where's Mom?
How bad is she?
She's in a bad condition, thanks to you!
Please calm yourselves.. .
I hope I'm not inte_ering...
"But she was beaten up badly.
You shouldn't have let that happened Jai."
I didn't want that to happen as well.
If I was there, no harm won't come to her for sure!
Only If you were there!
But were you there?
!
Calm down Malik!
You should have listened to me the first time!
Because of you, she suffers!
I don't want to fight you.
I just want to see her.
"You don't have to!
Have you ever been there for here all these while anmay?"
Yes, I know I'm bad!
But because I love all of you, especially Mom!
If anything happens to Mom, you are not my brother anymore.
Calm down Malik!
You can't face them alone!
Do you know what you're doing Malik?
Let's go!
What are you waiting for?
Get your boss to come and face me now!
I do not know where you're from.
I want to meet the guy who sent you!
"Don't talk so much!
You've made my mother suffer, now it's payback time!"
But I'm sure you're one of King's boys!
Mr Dragon, king of Petaling Street!
You're singing and lyrics are all over the place!
"And please do not happily accused King for this.
You better be careful!"
Don't let us cause another ruckus here!
Hey Shark!
Is this your guy?
Where is he from?
"He has nothing to do with me.
This is my brother's problem, but I'm settling it!"
Don't talk too much.
Let's settle this here!
Do you want me to find your brother?
Just wait till we deliver his head to your home!
No!
I won't wait!
Calm down Malik!
Are you crazy?
!
They're big shots.
They're in a different league.
Remember that they can cause harm to you at any time.
Please be way!
Remember that they can cause harm to you at any time.
Please be way!
Do you think that you can have a holiday here?
This place is hell!
Even if you want to commit suicide, this is not the place.
What are you talking about?
I'm here for my mother!
Bro, if you want to beat them, you will need him..
And his father has even offered you to join him.. .
Can I loin?
What?
I need a fighter, not a loker.
Dragon.. .Shark.. .
In that case, call me the Elephant.
"Jai, when will you settle your debts?
The interests are mounting now."
What debt?
I'm sure I'm on schedule.
"You agreed to deal with them.
Luckily they did not do more harm to your family."
Now all of us are in it as well.
You guys talk too much!
My family issues, I'll deal with it myself.
But what if they crash your house?
Please watch your mouth!
We're lust starting here.
I lust want to get rich!
The Bombay Gangster!
Having fun?
Hey Tailong!
I've been hearing a lot about you.
"Ne_ time if you want to come, tell me first.
I'll bring the sweetest ladies for you." "Ne_ time if you want to come, tell me first.
I'll bring the sweetest ladies for you."
I'm not here for pleasure.
"heard that you've become an ally to King.
While eveyone is backing me up, you want to oppose me?"
"You watch your mouth!
Let's have a mutual respect towards each other!"
For this matter, you started it.
It's just not right!
By why are you opposing me?
I need you to remember this!
Just stay here quietly here with all your dogs.
Or we'll be smashing heads instead of coconuts
You're not happy with for not backing you up?
Do you think you're so big that we all must follow you?
!
Remember that this is my place, BricMields!
Do you think I'm afraid to be here?
"lf you don't want to die, do not meddle between me and King anymore!"
"lf l hear you speak about it again, your wife will become a widow."
I know who he is, I've heard about him from King many times.
And he wants to smash Dragon's place alone?
He's crazy!
Even if the storm comes, he won't budge.
True, but can't he think?
If I wasn't there, he might be dead already.
You saw his moves just now, right?
Surely he can beat Dragon!
If there's no gun pointed onto his head, he won't fall.
That's why King wants him!
Only Malik can beat Tailong!
But would he want to loin us?
"You're thinking of attacking them on your own?
Without asking me?"
Eveyone knows me here!
"There's one time someone wanted to harm my mother, but I retaliated."
And eveyone is afraid of me from thereon.
The only one who can touch my mother is my dad.. .
Because it's halal!
The only one who can touch my mother is my dad.. .
Because it's halal!
"Doctor told me that my Mom has cancer, and it could lead to death."
And I'm not even sure if I can ever cover her medical expenses.
Now it is about money!
That could get her to recover.
As at now...
I think the only person that could help you.. .
...is King.
That's not a good option.
She might get worse if I take that route.
But sometimes that's probably the fastest way to earn money.
"And it's probably ok if we sacrifice our life for the people that we love."
Just think about it.
You can't do this to me!
"Last time you agreed that I was the one who'll protect your business."
Now you want to go to Tailong?
I'm not.
But if I don't follow him, he will disturb my business.
Don't wory. I know what I'm going to do with him.
Just don't pay anything to him.
If he disturbs you, I'll teach him a lesson.
"Pardon the intrusion. I haven't been honing my skills for quite a while."
And it seems that someone's been slowly tampering with my food.
Are you blind?
Your shots missed!
I'm in front of you now.
Ty to kill me if you can?
If it's up to me, I won't just tamper your food. I'll poison it!
Do ty your luck!
And you're lucky that you name's not on my list yet.
If not, you'll be like all these dead dogs.
I've chained these dogs, and you still want to deal with them?
Are you stealing my customers?
Who is stealing?
You've blackmailed them?
That's bad business!
I think you've walked into the wrong cage.
Be prepared!
We're going to have a feast!
"You still have him?
Since you're too loud, your name is now up on my hit list."
Hey!
Let me rest for a while first!
At least let me shoot you first, damn it!
What an unlucky night!
Step aside!
Throw down your weapon!
It's already 3am and you still want to disturb us?
You guys should just stay home with your wives!
Just throw down your weapon and follow us to the station.
Hury up!
What are you guys waiting for!
I'm giving you the orders now!
Let's overturn this patrol car!
Tonight we'll have a party!
You want to play games?
!
Let's play!
Lay down your weapons!
Hands above your heads!
On your knees!
What?
You don't know who that guy is?
Do you want to do your work or not?
"lf the guy did not inte_ere, I would have killed your husband already!"
What are you talking about?
"lf the guy did not inte_ere, I would have killed your husband already!"
What are you talking about?
"There's no new guy working for King.
And you know all of King's boys!"
How would I know about this?
I don't care but you must find out who he is!
For that new guy and his boss, I will separate their heads from their bodies!
Just settle this for me!
You're slick!
You can escape from my boys, Jai.. .
But you can't escape from me!
If it's up to me, I might have slit your throat!
You owe me money, but you still want to whack all my boys!
I don't really care what you're going to do to me.. .
But please do not touch my family!
Do not wory. I will still save you since I know you have potential.
I won't disturb your family, but I want you to follow me.
You want me to follow you, like all of them?
Just look at their style!
Hey Dragon, from what year are these silly looking cars!
But if I do follow you, how much would you give me?
.. .in euros or pound sterling?
Cars are not important.
Money is!
You owe me your life and you want to negotiate?
Cars are not important.
Money is!
You owe me your life and you want to negotiate?
Money is lust a small issue for me.. .
No, I don't smoke!
Who aren't you smiling?
Why does eveything here looks so gloomy?
We must be happy all the time!
This is not my place.
Why am I here anmay?
This is your future.
People are fighting to loin this place.
But for you, King gives you a red carpet treatment.
Thank you for protecting my dad.
If you weren't there, King would have died and Tailong would feel much superior.
No problem.
When he's in trouble, I'll help him.
We're like brothers already.
Now we're both controlling King's territories.
I want you to uplift his image.
"He's given you a car and an outfit.
Big brother shouldn't be walking."
You got a car?
I've sacrificed myself many times here.. .
and I weren't even offered a bike.
You're vey lucky!
Be grateful!
is this how you do business?
You'll get into trouble for sure.
Who are you to give me advice?
Have you forgotten who's the leader now?
"And now there's one guy who's been helping King, and attacking me."
I want him to suffer!
"But your style is filthy.
Because of that, no one respects me anymore."
I'm becoming filthy like you as well now.
Do you want King make alliance with the other heads and go against us?
I'm becoming filthy like you as well now.
Do you want King make alliance with the other heads and go against us?
Just let me destroy King and his clans!
Why do you speak like that?
You should greet first when you enter a new place.
I've never seen you before and you want to talk in that tone with me?
Teach him how to talk with me first before I cut out his tongue.
Don't inte_ere with me and Tailong, it's not your level.
"Do you think this is a PS game with all those levels?
Tell your brother not to disturb a sleeping tiger."
Why is he angy at King?
Who's the new guy anmay?
He's your brother!
Thank you for saving my life.
What's more important is that you're alive.
You're one of us now.
Please manage this place and protect my family.
As a big brother, please help to raise the image.
It'd be good for both of us.
Don't wory, I'll manage.
I'll get back all those places back from Tailong. I promise.
Don't wory, I'll manage.
I'll get back all those places back from Tailong. I promise.
Please excuse me.
The boys are waiting.
Why do you give a stranger to manage your place?
Can't Shark manage it?
Why him?
Both will take care of the place.
You should lust surrender to Tailong then.
I don't think I want to be with you anymore.
You are powerless now, I don't want to have a hard life.
Do you mean that you're only going to be with me when I'm in power?
And now you want to leave me?
What can you do anmay?
I don't even mind being with Tailong.
At least I'll be happy till I die.
"What kind of woman are you?
Do not challenge me!
I'll kill you!"
Where's the big brother?
"The most eligible bachelor has arrived.
Let's crash into any gangster's crib!"
Nice jacket. I thought I was the one joining King, not you.
Well, we must take care of our image.
Unlike you!
Well, we must take care of our image.
Unlike you!
Do you think you're Aaron Aziz?
Nice ride!
Never knew a mechanic could afford this!
I borrowed this.
It's not mine.
Borrowed?
Or did King give this to you?
I know eveything.. .
You can cheat Mom, but not me.
Hey you, don't inte_ere!
I don't care about this but don't tell this to Mom ok.
You act like you're so good... until Mom hated me.
"So are you doing the right thing?
Now you'd probably understand the word 'desperate' even more."
King's guy is now reuniting all the other big brothers.
They might lust follow him someday.
Do you think by just doing that, they'll follow him?
I'm not siding anyone, but if you're in trouble, I'll be in trouble too.
If you did not have a deal with me, do you think you'll get better?
Deal?
How do you deal?
Do you think I'm getting what was promised?
Are you saying that I'm lying to you?
If you want business, you wait for me.
If not, go!
King's guy is getting powe_ul now.
You should be prepared!
Why do you want to meet us?
If this is because of Tailong, please, that's not us!
No one wants to back up with you guys.
Tailong has attacked King, and you guys are not doing anything?
Do not become Tailong's slaves!
You guys are better than that!
It's not that - but he is ruthless!
Yes, do not fight him.
Just follow his leads.
You're just a kid and you want to fight Tailong.
Are you serious?
"You might just quit your business.
- No, we won't quit.
So watch your mouth!"
You guys are not acting like big bosses at all!
How dare you speak to me like that!
Just wait until I kill you and your entire family myself!
Are you gangster or are you mafia?
Who else wants to test my patience?
I'm not afraid if you're not backing me up.
But once Tailong is finished, I don't want to see your faces again!
Go take a rest!
Guys, that's King's brother!
But I'm the meaner version!
How is it?
Do you think Dragon can keep our secret?
If Tailong knows about you and Malik, that'll be the end.
I think your brother has chosen the wrong path
- it's a dead end for him!
I think your brother has chosen the wrong path
- it's a dead end for him!
I trust Dragon.
He's not really in favour of Tailong anymore.
Just do your iobs.
Let me handle Tailong!
What?
He has crashed into Tailong's territoy?
Where?
We just lose another customer to Tailong?
What should we do?
Listen up!
I don't think we should keep quiet.
Let's retaliate!
"Do you think it's that easy Malik?
Because of your action just now, they had their guns pointed at us!"
You nearly got us all killed earlier?
Do not play with an angel of death like Tailong!
Really?
I'd like to see him taking my life away then.
Are you afraid of Tailong?
He's quite strong.
So it's not easy to scare him.
You're still too young in this world.
There's a deeper stoy behind.
J I want to kill him as well but we still have time.
"Let's wait for King to recover, and get ourselves stronger.
Then we attack!"
Don't talk nonsense!
You dad wants us to uplift his image.
If you still want to play the game, just follow my leads.. .
let's attack Tailong tonight.
Mom, please listen to me first!
Mom, I know I'm guilty...and I'm sory.
"Yes it's true, I have borrowed money from loan sharks, but I have settled all the debts."
Save your speech Jai!
I don't believe in you anymore.
You have promised to me before, but you are still doing it.
When are you going to stop?
You have promised to me before, but you are still doing it.
When are you going to stop?
"Just tell me until when I should face this problem?
- Don't you pity our mother?"
"lf you didn't cheat them and have settled the debts, they will never come and disturb us here." "lf you didn't cheat them and have settled the debts, they will never come and disturb us here."
Aren't you afraid something might happen to her?
"Both of you don't have to be afraid, they will not disturb you anymore."
Let's move out from this ugly house.
My boss is vey rich.
If you don't believe me, look at this!
This is my salay, mom.
I have a lot of money mom, just ask for anything I will get it for you.
If you don't believe me, look at this!
This is my salay, mom.
I have a lot of money mom, just ask for anything I will get it for you.
These money are for you, they are not for me.
Tell me, where did you get all this money from?
!
Whose money did you steal, Jai?
I'm sure you are back to your old iob!
I'd rather disown you for this!
Probably you lust prefer to see us suffer?
Why can't you be more like Malik, your brother?
I'm Jai, Mom, not Malik.
I know I'm stubborn... full of sin...and it's wrong.. .
But I'm sure God knows what are my intentions.
Malik is a good son, Mom.
But I didn't expect him to.. .
Remember!
You are dealing with Tailong now.
This is his area.
I don't care who... as long as my business is safe.
Yes!
You have settled with Tailong but not with me.
Do you think you can escape after back stabbing me?
Yes!
You have settled with Tailong but not with me.
Do you think you can escape after back stabbing me?
Are you lost?
You are tying to be brave!
Just at the right time!
These are my boys.
Are you scared?
Please ask Tailong, how big is he?
You can play around with King, but not with me!
Now King's area is under my protection.
You have to remember my face!
You can play around with King, but not with me!
Now King's area is under my protection.
You have to remember my face!
Hey, handsome boy, you let Tailong know,
"if he wants to enter someone's house, he has to knock the door first!"
If not the family will be vey angy.
You'll be chased away, naked!
"Do you think I'm scared with your threat?
Once Tailong snaps his fingers, the whole KL will beat you!"
Hey don't talk nonsense!
"l don't care if I die tonight but be careful,
Tailong will destroy your clan!
Is that what you want?"
"You can take all of dad's money but I will kill you and your dad.
Is it fair?"
"lt's useless to talk or shoot this kid.
Keep your bullet!
He is not gangster enough for us!"
Ok, let's lust 'play' then!
Wow!
We're in for a treat!
Look at your son, Mom... he's the nice one.You should talk to him.
Just let me be the bad one.
Mom...please wait!
You don't have to explain.
I have seen eveything
I thought you are the one I can rely on... but look!
What have you done?
I have to do this Mom...
I thought you are the one I can rely on... but look!
What have you done?
I have to do this Mom...
"But I'm doing all this for you!
- What for Malik?"
This is not the way to earn money.
Don't you love me, Malik?
If I don't love, I won't be doing all these.. .
I'd rather die than watching all these...
Don't you ever call me Mom again...
You fool!
Who asked you to kill the kid?
"You are the one who want me to scare Tailong didn't you?
I did what you told me to."
Just scare them, not kill them you fool!
Let's lust move on!
And let's have fun!
Just remind him that killing is not my style!
If you are afraid with this job, go get lost!
This is King's place.
And you should follow my lead on this!
Jai, where have you been?
Do you know that your brother is not afraid of anything?
He doesn't care about his future...
Crashing into Tailong's place is a suicide mission...
But these are normal stuff to us, Dragon.
Crashing into Tailong's place is a suicide mission...
But these are normal stuff to us, Dragon.
I'm sure he will help King to rise again.
I like your brother...he'll make Tailong's tremble for a little while.
Tailong think he owns KL!
And luckily King has your brother.
With Malik around, Tailong now is not as powe_ul as before.
Tailong knows about this already?
Yes, and he wants to settle this issue.
Tonight is a silent night.. .
But tomorrow, when Tailong arrives, it will be doomsday!
Yes, I know I can't really cope with Malik...
But he's vey important, since we are tying to build up our strength.
If Malik is not around, we won't be as good.. .
But he's vey important, since we are tying to build up our strength.
If Malik is not around, we won't be as good.. .
I'm not telling you to do it now.
If he can fight Tailong, let him do it first.
We use him!
To fully exploit him?
What will King say?
It's quite good that we have him actually.
Do you want to let him lead this place and we become his servants?
Now, lust let him conquer Tailong's place.
Let's deal with him after that.
Yes Tailong.
Don't wory, I promise you that King will die.
Please, do not create crazy stories like this!
I'm not blind nor deaf.
I heard what she said.
It's hard to believe Susan is with Tailong's side.
Tailong is good at setting this game.
Maybe he already bought Shark too.
What the hell?
!
She knows that Malik's been helping King, right?
She's backstabber!
I bet she likes Tailong!
She knows that King is weakening.
That's why she wants to join Tailong's camp.
She'll kill anyone for money!
I don't buy this!
Enough!
You don't believe me?
What else are you waiting for?
You want to die first then only you'll act?
We already know this place is haunted with 'ghost'.
Let's destroy it!
I can't predict death.
"l've promised King to take care of his family, now you want me to eliminate her wife?"
Just relax.
While we're around, no one can touch King!
Tailong, last time people were afraid of you..
But it seems that nowadays people already have the gutsto crash into your territoy!
You shut your mouth, Dragon!
You know that I own KL.
If I can't get my money back, I'll kill that boy!
King has a new boy.
He's mad and he has fought all the other groups.
Who will back you up now?
He's mad and he has fought all the other groups.
Who will back you up now?
I don't need them to survive!
Malik has chosen own grave.
Anyone who inte_eres with me won't live that long.
Life and death is God's will.
But I can't wait to see your ne_ move on him.
With that boy around, it'd be harder for you to get to King.
What's so hard?
!
Difficult for me, or for him?
I don't need to dirty my hands for this!
"Just tell Tailong that tonight I'll 'settle' King, and I want my payment after that."
You're a swindler.
And now you're dead!
Thanks for dinner.
It's a bit aw_ard though to dine in a hotel.
If only Mom and Abang Jai could loin us...
Well, you can't really rely on yourAbang Malik for it.
You'll only get cheap stall food from him.
A pretty girl like you deserves better dining experience.
I need you to further your studies. I'll sponsor you.
Please finish your studies.
I don't mind not continuing if we can't afford it.
You realize that our Mom does not like you in this kind of work, even though you're doing it for our family.
I'll quit when eveything is settled, don't wory.
Although Mom has probably kicked you out...but in reality...
Here's some money for you.
But don't tell mom that I gave it to you.
Zati, if you want more fine dining after this, just let me know.
I'll take you out, if Malik allows.
Don't wory, it'll just be a dining session.
Have you ever been beaten up byAbang Malik?
Are you angy?
But what's wrong if I become your brother...?
You can't find anybody as good as me nowadays.. .
I'll buy you alive!
I will kill you!
Slow down Malik!
"She wanted to destroy you, and yet you wanted to take care of her?"
"l told you that I'll take care of this!
But you still took your own action!"
Why don't you respect me Aiib?
What's with you?
Even if she's a traitor, we can't just kill her.
We can always talk this over!
This problem is out of control now!
Do you want Malik to die, then only we take action?
I purposely act like this so that you guys can go far!
Hey Malik!
You might have done the same if you're in my shoes!
"Haven't I told you that we can kill outsiders, but do not touch those in our circle!"
Now you owe King, you have to repay him Jib!
You are acting against someone who has saved you.
But I don't mind.
Just buy me alive. I'll be proud to die in your hands.
But before you kill me, I've to inform you something.. .
I did this because I love our gang!
Family!
...
Blood brothers!
Malik, don't kill him now.
He's in bad condition now.
Do kill him when he has repented
Enough Malik!
Be patient Shark.
I really do not know who has done this.
But I've told our new brother to find the killer.
You don't know?
You don't have to force yourself to find him.. .
I know who he is.
Who is it?
But I pity the guy
When he has power, people worshipped him.
When he is falling, he resorted to this.
One day.. .with these bare hands.. .
I will take his life away!
A brother killing another brother's wife.
How do I deal with this?
Life is vey cheap now.
Just like those cheap sunglasses that you're wearing.
Suddenly I feel like I'm a Columbian gangster.
Reminds me of my gloy days.. .
Even the Yakuza guys asked for my assistance.
But I feel Ajib's suspicion towards Susan is justified.
I don't care who's wrong or right, that's not important.
Now, what should I answer to King?
!
Stop thinking about the deceased.
"You have to think about yourself...
and your family.That's more important."
She should not have been killed!
We owe somebody a life now.
But what about my debts?
You want to meet me now Tailong?
I don't have time for all of this.
Do you know that I need to visit the other leaders too?
Before you meet them, you have to see me first!
You can ty to thrash the other leaders.. .
But if you hit on me, you'll die!
Do you understand?
Oh I'm so afraid!
Are you that great?
Shut your mouth Jai?
Why are you suddenly in bad mood?
It's not nice, Tailong.. .
If we can't shut your boy's mouth, let me handle him.
You're a mean friend, Dragon!
You bring this scumbag in my home!
you know how much I hated Malik and yet, you brought him?
That's your issue with King.
This guy has nothing against you.
"lt's ok Dragon, really, how long do you want to listen to this old gangster?"
Yes, I am Malik's brother!
So what?
I like your style.
You remind me of my younger self.
Dragon, I'd like to have your permission to 'test' your kid tonight.
How do you feel young man?
And I'm lust getting started.. .
We can talk this over.
This kid knows nothing!
And because of that, I'm teaching him this lesson.
I even have a show tonight.
Please help me, brother!
Hey, lust leave her alone!
Do you dare to stop me?
You know that I'll exploit eveything.. .
You're not human.
You're an animal!
Hey, kill me if you want.
But don't touch her!
Let's go!
What's up Zati?
You think that you're so big huh?
Why are you after my sister?
Let me find you, then it is fair!
Why are you after my sister?
Let me find you, then it is fair!
Hey Malik.. .l do admire you for your courage.
"You showed your fangs and you've been barking eve_here, do you think I'm just going to keep quiet?"
What do you want from me?
I want my money back!
If not, I'll buy your siblings!
Go back and seek your Mom for forgiveness before it's too late.
Help me!
Abang Jai
Tora Tora is requesting your permission to be united with your sister.. .
Help me brother!
What are you going to do now?
Tailong has taken my sister.
"He wants his money!
Just give it to me.
- l know"
And I've warned you about this, right?
!
You've walking on thin ice now.
If you go and meet Tailong, you're just as good as dead!
Why are you scolding him?
He has helped us before.
We should help him!
Why are you scolding him?
He has helped us before.
We should help him!
If you want to get hurt, lust go!
I've helped you, and you still want to play games over this?
!
I give you an option here.. .
Either you help me destroy Tailong.. .
Or I go and join Tailong to come here for you!
If I've no respect for King, I would have let you go into that trap.
Ok. I'll give you that money, and just take whatever you want.
We'll go there.
But this time, we won't come empty handed.
Let's start a war - and fight to the end!
Your Mom is in critical condition.
She needs to undergo surgey as soon as possible.
You need RM200,OOO now.
If not, there's no guarantee if she'll survive.
Sister!
Hey, look at this!
Thank you brother!
I haven't tasted something fresh for so long.
You really know how to take care of your sister.
It's been great for me.
Even animals have feelings.. .
But you're lust worse!
Hey, I'm worse than the devil.
And I can become meaner if I want to.
I swear to you, that you'll die by my hands.
"Hey!
Do you know that for so long l've been waiting for someone to kill me."
But I'm still alive!
Probably Hell also won't accept me.
Probably even the depths of Hell wouldn't want you!
Are you sure that you are going to Heaven?
Wow, are you sure these aren't toy guns?
My underground connection.
We could take over the world with this!
Show me the money first, then we'll talk.
It is good ifwe can have a reunion like this once in a while.
So that we can become closer.
Do you want us to be closer?
Just let me beat you up first!
You're lust talking nonsense!
"Although you think that you're powe_ul, sadly I don't have any respect for you."
I'm so scared!
How is King now?
Is he bedridden?
Shark, I can guarantee you...
"if your mother is still alive, she will surrender herself to become my mistress."
How is your Dad?
He's probably like a mannequin now!
Not even a single woman would want to be with your dad now.
Hey Malik!
Do you want to be Superman, and rescue King?
Maybe you want me to kiss your sister in front of you.
Hey Malik!
Do you want to be Superman, and rescue King?
Maybe you want me to kiss your sister in front of you.
Hey!
I have what you need already!
Let's settle this!
Shut up!
Just give back my money!
I've never met foolish gangsters like all of you!
I can kill all ofyou now, and put all ofyou in the same grave!
Hey Malik!
Tell your sister to take care of my baby.
Malik...
Jai...
I'm now your brother in law
Run!
Save your life!
Where do you think you're going?
I think it's time for me to rest now.
I have ruined your sister. I will enjoy myself if you die today!
Your mom is dying right?
Even a 'softy' is a better fighter than you!
Do you think I could be defeated that easily?
Remember that this is Tailong!
You should complete your lesson first before you can fight me!
Do you want me to ritually wash your dead body?
Maybe you want me to do this to your sister in front of you?
Bro, don't wory about Zati, you have my word...she will be safe!
You are vey brave!
Let's go and have fun tonight!
It'll be a happy ending!
Give me that money!
Do you want this?
You can ty to get it now!
But my task is not yet complete.
If you want this money, get it from King.
Jai, you should go and visit Mom in the hospital, she's vey ill.
I'm sory brother, but your ending is not that great!
Malik, are you ok?
Where are you brother and sister?
You can go back now, I have troubled you a lot.
Don't wory, I'm fine as long as you are fine.
I want to see my Mom now.
You can go back now.
Thanks!
Mom, I've never intended to put you in harm's way.
What I have done, it's because of my love for you
and I want to give the best for you.
I swear to God, please believe me!
We all love you so much, Mom.
I'm not so sure if... I have enough time to apologise to you.
I have settled all the medical bills, I just hope you'll recover I don't want to lose you
But I hope you will understand, that as long as me and Jai are still alive,
we are willing to die for you!
It's ok Mom, but please don't ever think that we all never cared about you.
I'm sory.
Jai and Zati are now outside.
If you'd like to see them.. .
Brother, she will never understand what we have done for our family.
She will always think that we are bad.
It's up to her to understand or not.
We are the one who has choose to live to this kind of life.
She'd never forced us.
That's why she can't accept it.
But in this situation, do you want us to stay like this?
How is Mom doing?
I don't know what else to say to you Jai.. .
Mom is dying and you are still blaming her for not accepting us?
Mom just can accept that you're in so much debt!
Do you know our father run away because of debts?
Do you know I am the one who's been taking care of his debts?
I don't want both of you to become victims, so just let me handle it.
Do you think that a mechanic like you can pay our father's debt?
Now I don't really care about what's going to happen to me...
But If you guys ever need me, just ty to find me.
Look...
Have you seen what has happened to Mom?
...and to me?
Our family is ruined because of you!
So it is done?
KL is my own heaven now!
And you're going to be in hell, Malik!
Mom!
Dear God, I've been afraid of this day for so long.. .
but why must it come today?
When the person I love needed me most.. .
My stoy ends here.. .
A dark stoy that is filled with chaos... and filled with pain.
I fought and sacrificed for my family.
But I know that what I did was wrong.
I'll accept my fate.
and all ofyour obstacles.
Dear God, I'm willing to sacrifice my life if that could save her life... I beg from you.. .
please save my Mom and my family.
Don't let them become a disgrace like me.
KL...
Kuala Lumpur
The centre of attraction for our people
Everything is here
But in order to survive in this big city there's a lot of challenges and a lot of suffering
Everything seems fine
But it secretly keeps an abundance of stories
And my story starts here
Jai, my brother
Someone who's an extremist
Always doing something hastily without thinking
In order to get quick money
He is beyond control
My good friend King
The biggest gangster in KL
It was King and I who had expanded this group
Until the group was feared by all the other groups
But everything has changed
Shark, King's step son...
He's the type that would do almost anything for his own gain
A power crazy person
And because of him, I'm stuck here
For five years I've been serving my time in prison
I've been found guilty of armed robbery
And I know...
Shark had planned all these to ruin me ...behind King's back.
Human being can do almost anything for power and wealth
Although this includes backstabbing their own kind
And I've been waiting for today
Today is the daythat I'll be released from prison
Free from everything
Bro..
Ajib..
How was your long vacation?
Was it good?
.
The vacation has ended...
How's Dragon?
.
Hmm... that you must ask him yourself
Let's go!
Malek is back!
Malek is!
Hoho...
Malek!
Ajib!
Guys!
Malek, come here...
I miss you bro!
Come to Papa!
Oh my God, what's up bro!
Has anyone been annoying you?
Just tell me...
I'll smack him!
And have you been going to a fitness centre?
Weren't you in jail?
.
Fitness centre, your head!
You seemed bigger...
Bigger?
I think I'm still like before
Don't joke around, bro.
I'm not talking aboutyour body, it's your nose!
Wow Ajib!
He's making fun of my nose!
He's looking for trouble!
Ok guys, let's go!
Wear your seatbelt!
I don't want to pay any summonses!
Jai, there's an intruder in our territory
Let's teach them a lesson.
Which gang?
Can't you handle them?
Small matters like this, you still want me to be involved?
.
The problem is that, Dragon had asked us to go.
They've intruded Robert's place...
So how is it?
Dragon had asked us?
.
Hmm...
Sigh... please don't intervene into my business.
Can't you find some other place, my friend?
Hey, don't play around with us!
Ifyou don'twant us to meddle around here, just pay us!
I want this place, do you understand?
.!
How come?
I've already got Dragon to look after this place...
If you want it, you should settle with Dragon!
No, we want you to deal with us, understand!
Hey, where's the money?
Hey rotten flies!
You guys are way out of your head!
You still want to interfere my business?
.!
Is this your place?
.
How come a scumbag like you would conquer this place?
Just go, before I sweep you out!
Leave!
I give you two options...
You want to do it the hard way... or the soft way?
If I don't succumb, what would you do?
.
Who's the carcass now?
Me or you?
.
Do you like it?
.
Please don't do this again!
Police!
There, your uncles have arrived!
Wow, it's only been 5 years but KL has changed a lot...
Wake up bro!
Malaysia's a developing country, of course there'll be lots of changes.
Just like me...
People used to call me Fadil.
Now they call me Brother Long Dil...
Brother Long Fadil!
It's kind of weird...
Do we still have our guys?
A lot have left.
The most active one is only Ajib.
But Ajib's not with Shark anymore.
He follows Dragon now.
But we can't really blame him.
He's afraid that he could become a victim like you...
A victim to Shark!
So what's going on with Shark?
Shark the scumbag?
.
Whenever I speak of him, my blood rises!
He causes trouble everywhere, and crashes all over the place!
What's his deal?
!
I hate it!
Just let him be...
Ifhe wants to be the big gangster, let him be - as long as he's happy with it.
I think let's do it like this King...
I have no issues with you.
For 3 years I've been doing business with you...
There's not been any problem.
But lately, why have your guys been interfering with my business?
.
Tony, big brother!
Now you're in our area...
It's King's territory.
The fact that you can have to run your business here, it's good enough.
What else do you want?
Is it not enough?
I know, but I've already paid your dad.
Why do you still want me to payyou?
You have paid?
.
How much have you paid?
.
1 million?
. 2 million?
.
No, right?
.!
You're earning millions and you pay so little...
It's not enough!
So do you want to do business in the area or not?
If not, please do your business elsewhere.
Don't create any trouble here.
Because you might not leave this place in peace.
That'd be a problem!
You've created your issues with me and now you want to add more problems?
Do you think this is your place?
.
So what do you want now huh?
Come fight me!
Let's go... you think I'm afraid of you?
- Come!
Come!
- Hey guys!
OkTony, let's settle this.
I promise you that our boys will not interfere with your business anymore...
We'll deal like before.
I'm sorry King.
I'm not going to do business with you anymore.
I've already dealt with another party.
Who?
Dragon!
He guards my place now.
What's the problem now?
You guys still want to give me a headache?
.
Shark still hates you.
You took away his client.
Do you think I care?
.
It's not my problem.
He did not take good care of his client, so he has to deal with it now.
Butyou have to rememberthat you've crashed into his area.
If King retaliates... he will surely show his might.
Well, you should know better.
How are King's boys?
Now it's his stepson that is causing all the chaos.
I don't think he dares to touch me.
Some more Shark is used to crashing into other people's areas before...
Now I'm just crashing back, then it'd be a fair fight.
Hope he's not afraid...
A customer like that is not really my type, Dragon.
Even if he sends in 10 guys, I won't budge.
But if he touches you, I would 'kiss' him.
Are you guys having fun?
.
Wow, there's lots of money you have there?
I'm sure that's Dragon's money you've taken away.
To survive, we must be smart!
Don't let anyone go over us!
Are you crazy?
.
If Dragon finds out, we'd be in trouble Jai!
Why are you guys so panicky?
What's the helter skelter?
You just should know what you're doing.
Never let this secret out!
How much of Dragon's money have we taken?
.
If he ever finds out, we'd be in deep trouble!
I'll ask you guys this...
Do you know howwealthythe guy is?
.
He won't go poor if he loses this amount...
Ifwe just rely on his payments, you guys will have nothing!
I want to buy better meals...
Do you guys know what you've done?
You've'burned' my money away!
I did this for all of us... and for you King!
So that everyone will look high on you.
It's not for fun!
Butyou're such a softy.
You give them too much freedom.
How would they respect us?
.
Who are you to dictate how much they should pay us?
I'm the one who runs the business here.
Now, because of you, we're losing business.
Hey, don't worry too much... because it'll give you more headache.
I promise you that I'll get back the place.
There's no need!
Let Dragon take over of the place.
The place is no more ours.
Don't think that since you're my stepson...
You can do whatever you want.
After this, whatever you want to do, discuss it with me first.
If you want to stay in this business for long...
Hey babe!
I heard that your brother's out of prison.
So what's the story?
How do you know this?
.
The guys told me about it.
Guess you can't enjoy much after this?
Why not?
.
Well, ifyour brother finds out what you've been doing...
And your well-being... that'd be a problem right?
.
To hell with that!
I'm no more a child.
I can do whatever I want!
Do you think my brother's that good?
.
It's ok...
After this, whatever we want to do...
Let's do it discreetly.
Come in bro!
Sorry if my home is too small for you.
I wish to buy that bungalow in the front, but I've no budget for it.
All because I bought this plasmaTV and this cool belt.
I'm still grateful, bro.
I'm sorry If I'm troubling you.
Please do not speak like those evening TV drama series?
.
I can't take that!
I'm you brother now...
So do you think I would want to see you homeless?
.
Surely I'll help you out.
I'm a responsible brother!
So why do you have this ancient sword here?
.
Hey bro!
Ouch!
That hurts!
Ifyou haven't gotten the skills, please don't ever touch this sword.
There are a lot of stories revolving around this sword.
Brother Long Kerinchi, had his guts splattered...
Brother Long Bukit Bintang, had his sinus problem recovered from this sword.
I don't want to bore you with all these.
All my stories and experiences...
You might not believe me then.
Just sit here first, I'll fetch us a drink.
Don't worry, I won't serve alcohol.
Don't you have any other food besides drinks?
Wow, you're so demanding!
Let's just have a drink first.
We'll dine outside afterwards.
Have you seen my mom lately?
Yes, I've seen her...
But you know the situation...
But how come you don't want to go back?
.
I'll go back when I'm ready.
I think you should go back...
Your mom is not doing well.
I really pity her!
Where are my younger siblings then?
How could they'd left my mom like that?
Your siblings aren't like you.
Despite your appalling ways, you still know your responsibilities to your family.
Take Jai, for example...
Ever since he joined Dragon's gang, he never returned home.
And your sister Zati...
I'm sorry to say this, but she's been acting wild.
And because of all that, you mom is left alone at home.
You should go back and visit your mom.
She usually runs her business here until late.
Let's go and find her.
There she is!
Let's meet her!
What's the problem bro?
.
Let's meet her.
I'm not seeking for wealth Malik.
I do not want all of that.
I just want my son to be a good person.
Why don't you go find yourself a proper decent job?
.
Why do you have to do all these things?
.
You don't have to worry mom.
I'm doing all these for your happiness.
For our family's happiness.
Do we have a dad for this?
I would rather be poor than having to make a living from all these unlawful activities.
I can't stand to be cursed and abused by the rest of the villagers here.
You've have humiliated me too much.
I'm ashamed of you Malek.
Just get away from here, son.
Leave us...
And don't come back.
Just go.
Go!
Dragon, you look good!
Guess you're in a happy mood?
!
Why do you want to meet me?
.
I've got lots of stuff to do.
I've no time to deal with a wussy like you.
What do you want?
.
You still want to ask me what I want?
Please don't create any problems with me Dragon.
You might regret it.
You're barking too loud!
Just like a dog!
Doyou know that?
Why do you have to saythings like that?
Do you think by talking like that, I'd be afraid?
.
Tony has asked me to guard his place.
He doesn't trust you anymore.
I actually might listen to King over this matter...
But to discuss it with a young chap like you...
I thinkyou should go.
And go take care of your other areas.
Don't make a big fuss around here.
You talk so loud!
Do you know that I've never been defeated?
Do you thinkyou're too big already?
.
Come let's have a duel with me now!
And get all your'dogs'to join in too...
I'd like to see how tough they really are.
You should be careful Dragon...
Ifyou enterTony's place again, I'll kill you!
It's not easyto enterthe place, ok!
Hey Shark, ifyou want to be rude...
Come talkto me!
I'll show you myfangs!
Hey Shark, do you see me trembling in anyway now?
.
I'll certainly be waiting for you!
You're still a child and you still want to enter this line of work?
.
Rrr... about you...
I can't understand your recent behavior.
Why didn't you want to meet your mom just now?
.
I don't think that's necessary.
Why should I make her angry again?
Furthermore, she's already chased me out of the house.
But that was a long time ago.
I'm sure that she has forgiven you.
Any motherwill definitely love her children.
And any children will surely love their mothers.
Ifyou still love your mom, why do you only gazed on her from afar?
.
Love... gaze.
Love... gaze.
Say if I love my girlfriend, and I only gaze on her from afar...
If she asks me why I'm doing that...
Is it like that?
You're silly!
Hey silly, what tookyou so long to get my drink?
Don't you know how to do your work?
Please forgive me forthe delay.
I had to settle some work just now.
Don't make up excuses, silly!
Do you know how long I had waited for my drink?
!
Do your work faster next time!
Hey!
Bro, I'm sorry...
You should not have hit him...
Please be more reasonable.
What is it to you?
Why can't you just talk to him, instead of hitting him?
So, you're not satisfied with me?
You want to die?
!
Stupid guys!
Hey, why did you take my'meal'?
I just felt like having 'breakfast'!
I feel ashamed that I couldn't hit any of them just now.
Hey, those guys just now...
Why did you let them go away?
.
Why didn'tyou just knock them out?
You think they're toys?
And why didn't you join in the fight?
.
Staring and gawking only.
But you didn't join in the fight.
How could you ask me such a question?
.
You know that I have a fist of fury.
Furthermore I'm trained in aikido...
So don't limit me to fight only two men, I should fight a lot more men.
Over there, the idiots!
There you have what you wish for!
So do you thinkyou can handle them?
.!
Yes, I'm here.
Hey, did you hear somebody calling for me?
I gotta go...
Ok, I'm coming!
Old man!
Get lost!
So is this your place now?
You have to be careful.
A lot of guys are still not pleased with you.
Why have you abandoned mom?
.
Zeti could take care of mom!
I don't have the time.
Hey, do you think even though I was doing time...
I have not heard stories of you?
What made you so busy that you can't look after mom?
.
Too busy in wanting to become a gangster leader?
If I became a gangster leader, what is it to you?
Ifl stay home, can I get money from mom?
.
Of course she does not have any money...
That's why she had to survive by selling food by the roadside...
Damn you!
You don't have to teach me anything.
I think you're worse than me.
You're not the person to give such lectures to me!
So how is it now, Shark?
.
I don't think Dragon will ever let go ofTony's place.
So, what should we do?
.
Should we just take the place back?
.
It's not that easy for us to push Dragon out.
He has a large network.
But do not worry.
I know how to teach him a lesson.
As at now, I want you guys to find Jai.
He's Dragon's main man.
He's the only guywho could settle all of this.
You want Jai?
.
Shark, do you know that it's not easy to get him?
He's a nutcase, just like his brother.
He's beaten a lot of our guys.
That's why I want him.
I want him to finish off Dragon.
And destroy Malek.
Just plan anything, I onlywant him!
But how about Malek?
He's out of prison now.
What ifhe's searching foryou now?
.
What can he do to me?
He has nothing now.
Why should we be afraid?
Ifyou're only scared because of him...
You should feed your'thing'to the dogs.
Butyou should remember this Shark...
He's close to King.
If he rejoins King...
You'd be in trouble!
It's not easy to maintain a Ferrari engine...
I just changed this, and you're already giving me trouble.
What's wrong with your car?
.
It's this fuse.
I had just changed it, but it's still giving me problems.
So what's your plan after this?
My plan is...
To find work, and make some money.
Find work?
.
Make money?
.
Even I can't find any jobs for the last two months.
Don't think it'd be easy with you.
With your current status...
Sorry to say that bro.
It's ok, I'm sure there's something for all of us.
As long as we work for it... in whatever way.
As long as it's not illegal or haram.
But remember to look after your mom once you get a job.
You have to lift some ofher burdens.
Do you know where I could find Zeti?
.
Wow, the big brother is out of prison!
I thoughtyou're already dead!
So how is it brother?
.
How are you doing?
You should go back.
I don't want to see you face around here.
Who do you think you are to chase me away?
Do you think this is your place?
.
I can go anywhere as I please.
Malek, you're now beneath me.
So how is it?
.
Are you afraid of me?
Who do you think you are, for me to be afraid of you?
I've been to war way before you had those tattoos!
For the last five years you've been in prison, and yet you think you're still cool.
Do you know to whom you're speaking to?
I can annihilate you anytime!
I want to see you destroy me!
What are you guys waiting for?
.
One dayyou'll get it Malek!
For sure, you'll get it!
I come to warn you this...
Don't ever tryto regroup with King.
Ifyou ever enter my place, you're a dead man!
Don't you dare talk so much!
If it's not because of your dad, you would still be nothing now!
And if it's not because of my respect to your dad,
I would have slapped your face!
Slap myface?
So where's your move?
.
Bro, are you ok?
I'm good.
King!
How are you?
Are you good?
.
Why didn't you tell me that you're out?
I could have fetched you there.
Fadil is around.
I don't want to trouble you.
Hey Malek, we've been friends for ages...
So when will you join me?
I'm sorry King, but I'm clean now.
Are you sure you're just going to clean yourself out just like that?
.
Our territory has gotten bigger and wider.
I need you to help me!
It's ok bro, I think I need to lay low for now.
You have your step son, right?
Just guide and train him.
If there's any problem, do come and see me... anytime.
Why are you looking for me?
Why?
.
I think you know.
I trusted you, but what have you done to me?
.
Where's Robert's money?
Have I not paid you enough?
Dragon!
How much do you earn, and how much do you give me?
I've been guarding a lot of your areas outside.
And you're still being calculative with me.
How much I earn, that's my business.
Who are you to question that?
I'm your boss!
Ifyou deceive me next time, I'll destroyyou!
Ooo...
I'm afraid!
You think you can destroy me that easily.
Just remember, who's been helping you.
Who has been pushing your name up?
.
If it's not because of me, you can't be a leader now.
Your place won't be as big as it is now.
If you want to live lavishly, I want that too.
So do you want to go against me?
.
If you want to live wealthily, you have to find your own place.
Don't go crashing into other people's place.
If you still want it, I could give you the same.
If you don't want it, I don't care.
Ajib can take care of my place.
We have no more 'stuff'..
Is this all?
.
Please give me more...
Is this what you're doing now?
.!
What are you doing here?
.
Just go away, and leave me alone!
I'm your brother!
Don't try to be rude with me!
Ifyou want to ruin your life, do it after I'm dead!
Let's go back now!
You can't force me!
What can you do if I don't want to go back home?
!
Hey, what's the problem here?
.
This is a family matter.
If you're not satisfied, just wait for me outside.
I need to speak to my sister!
Who's your sister?
Bob, please ask him to leave.
Please do not create a scene here!
You should go!
I'll smash your face ifyou don't leave!
Please calm down.
Hey!
What's your problem?
.
Causing chaos here, in my place?
I heard that you've just been released.
Please don't create any problems.
Just ask your guy first on who started this.
I'm here to find my sister.
Ok, fine!
We can settle this!
Can you not interfere with my business here?
Ifyou don'twant me meddle, can you forbid my sister from coming here?
.
Can you?
Guys, you haven't seen Abang Long Dil in action yet!
If it's Abang Long Dil, this guywould be dead by now.
After this... hope you would understand.
So ifyou see me here, don't ask me for any entrance charge...
And give me two girls, ok?
.
You!
Oh no!
All this is my fault!
IfI've broughtthem up properly, and showthem good manners...
Theywould not have turned out to be like this...
But you can't blame yourself entirely.
Your sister had chosen her own path.
But do you think I should let her destroy herself?
Be patient bro!
One day she'll change for the better.
Oh no!
What's happening here?
Are we being attacked?
I think I'm hurt!
Help me, please!
That's my car being barbequed!
How will I travel after this?
.
I have nothing now!
That's my only'asset' now!
I know...
God's just testing me.
If you ask me King, I don't want it!
What's the use?
.
We don't need him anymore.
You already have me.
We've been fortunate because of him.
It's you who don't know our history.
I don't really care what he'd contributed to you before.
But he just got out of prison.
If the police have marked him, you'll be in trouble.
But it's your choice.
If you want him here, just go ahead!
Hey!
What's the problem here Malek?
!
Are you not satisfied?
Come here!
You have no manners!
Haven't your mom taught you anything?
.!
Don't talk so much here!
You're pissed offwith me right?
So I'm here now!
What are you waiting for?
!
Are you crazy?
.
You come here into my place and you want to show your might here!
Please don't make me torture you!
Malek, ifyou're not satisfied, let's talk amicably.
Please have some respect to me!
It's true that I'm very displeased!
You son has burned my friend's car!
You think I would keep quiet!
What are you talking about?
.
Please talk clearly!
Who burned your car?
.
Ifyou have proof, just call the police to apprehend me.
Who else is there?
.
Now, you're the only one who hates me!
You want to fight me just because of that ageing car?
.
Please don't waste mytime!
I know you're broke...
And you want to ask from us for money, right?
!
Shark!
What's the problem here Malek?
You come here in this manner...
Your son has done many dreadful things to me.
I won't come here if I have no problems with him.
How do you know Shark did that?
You can't just simply accuse without any evidence.
Please teach your son some manners.
If he crosses me again, I'll annihilate him!
I won't care about anything anymore.
Even though that requires me to face you.
Maybe Shark did not do it?
How many enemies do you have?
.
Maybe it's them?
.
That's why I need you back here in myteam.
My guys can take care of you.
I did time for 5 years...
A lot of guys wanted to make me suffer when I was there.
And seriously, there's nowhere to run there.
I think I can take care of myself.
Jai!
Shark wants to see you!
Why does he need to see me?
.!
Send my regards to his uncle!
You don't have to be in bad terms with Jai...
It's just a small matter.
Small matter?
!
He's conned me and you say it's a small matter?
Do you know how much has he stolen from me?
.
And he even dared to lecture me on that?
Who does he think he is?
.
That kid doesn't remember his roots!
So, who's the big brother now actually?
!
Me or him?
!
.
Of course it's you!
But I think we can compromise.
Just remember, without Jai, we would both be in trouble.
Now he's guarding your territory.
What else do you want?
Do you think I can't survive without him?
My business could still run as usual even without him.
Now I don't care anymore!
It's not my problem anymore.
The cute guy is here!
Wow, you're Dragon's gangster...
I heard that you're very powerful outside?
!
I've been so scared!
But how come you're stuck here now?
You're not a big gangster after all, I guess?
.
What do you want from me?
I have no qualms with you, Shark...
You've battered all my guys...
And you've taken awayTony's place...
And yet you say that you have no qualms with me?
!
Just show your might to me now, I want to see!
Show me!
Ifyou don'twant your guys to be beaten up by me don't enter Dragon's terrain
We can't enter Dragon's terrain?
If I want to enter or trespass, that's my decision!
Who are you to forbid me from doing that?
!
I've suffered so much loss because of you guys already!
Do you know that?
!
So, what do you want now?
.
I want you to join me...
If you wish to live longer.
I'm not afraid of dying!
But I don't want to die.
If you want me to follow you...
Just forget it!
How much do you need?
.
I can give to you.
A lot more than Dragon...
But just get rid of Dragon, can you do that?
I'm loyal to my Maker.
Zetty, where have you gone to?
You have not been home for two days!
I was at my friend's place.
Even ifyou were staying there, please inform me.
I was very worried about you.
You're a girl!
Don't be worried, mom!
I know how to take care of myself.
Furthermore, I didn't go back because I had to work.
What do you know?
.
You were working?
.
What sort of work is that... that wouldn't let you come back home?
Please don't nag mom.
I'm stressed now!
Another thing...
Do you know who I bumped into just now?
.
I saw Abang Malek!
You brother's out of prison already?
Yes, he is out.
But see what's happening...
Has he come back here to see us?
.
No, mom!
He doesn't care about us anymore!
What's up?
If you're here to discuss about Jai, you'll be wasting my time.
Ifl don't think of him as a friend, surely I would have him destroyed already.
In that case, you should just proceed to beat him.
But do you think he's scared of death?
.
He's a tough one.
And that's whywe should take care of him.
What's the problem?
Malek is now out right?
.
Why don'twe just rope him in to join us?
That's crazy?
Malek's a big gangster...
You really want him to join you?
.
I know that he's an overlord...
The reason why I want him to join us is because I'd like to help him.
He's an ex-convict.
What can he do with his life now?
He has cleaned himself.
He has repented.
Go ask him first!
You're his close friend right?
.
Just tell him that Dragon's inviting him to join in.
Shark, our guy has just informed us that Malek's now in our territory.
Which area?
.
Selangor wholesale market.
Hey, can't you see your steps?
Are you blind?
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
.!
You ran into me and you apologized?
.
That's it?
Do you know how to do your work?
!
.
Hey, if you don't know how to do your work, do not come and work here!
Do you understand?
!
You can just tell me all that without kicking right?
.
So, what's the problem?
You're not happywith me?
.!
Tell me!
Big brother, I'm very sorry.
He's new here.
He doesn't know anything.
You, don't interfere!
Get away!
Hey, I'm not done with you yet!
Hey Malek!
Listen up!
You have to be careful.
They're all gangsters here!
This is their territory.
They often cause trouble here?
That's not your business!
Just do your job here.
Hey, ex-convict!
I'm not done with you yet!
Don't turn your back to me!
Listen to me!
When I'm back here tomorrow,
I don't want to see your face here anymore.
If I see you, I'll whack you!
Understand!
Please don't be like this big brother!
It was an accident.
Hey, old man!
What's your problem?
.
Do you really want to defend this stupid kid?
You!
Get away before you all become corpses!
Let's go!
Hey prisoner!
I'm not done with you yet!
Hey!
Don't let me chop you into pieces... then you'll regret it!
You guys are going to pay!
Are you ok?
I'm fine.
Thanks!
What are you doing here?
.
This smelly place...
You don't have to worry about me, Ajib.
I'm comfortable to be working in a place like this.
You're comfortable, you say?
.
You, me, Dragon... karaoke joint, 5 stars, with girls.
Now that's a comfortable place!
You're only selling these vegetables.
Theveggies we sell are about a few thousand ringgit per kilogram...
These veggies are only about a few ringgit, you still want to sell these?
.!
I've put all those things behind me now.
I want to start a new life, Ajib.
Start a new life?
Your old life was magnificent, you have nothing in your new life now!
Please try to understand my decision.
I'm only asking for that from you.
Vegetables!
Vegetables!
Are you sure that you want to join Shark's gang?
You have to think it thoroughly.
They're quite dangerous.
The term dangerous doesn't exist in my book.
Are you scared?
.
They want to give us money.
And you don't want it?
.
And somehow you mentioned about danger.
But they're our rivals.
If Shark sets us up, we can be nabbed easily by the police.
Now Shark has asked us to crash Ajib's place.
Are you out of your mind?
.
Yes I am!
I don't care about crashing into anybody's place.
As long as I can get money!
All of you will get your portion too.
Shark can pay more.
Why should we stay under Dragon's wings?
Butyou must not forget that Ajib's our friend.
Ajib has helped us a lot before this...
Ajib will always be Ajib.
Money is still money.
How else can we make money?
.
But ifyou guys do not to be a part of this... hmm.
I know what I'm doing...
I want somebody like him.
Why do you still keep the kid alive?
I thoughtyou'd alreadywanted him dead.
If Malek knows that his brother is joining us,
I'm sure he'll hate you more.
That's even better!
Lets him hate me more!
Now his brother is our dog, we can do a lot of things now!
What ifhe betrays us?
Can we trust him?
.
You don't have to remind me about that!
That rotten corpse can be controlled easily with money.
I know how to handle him.
So, do you reallywant him to go after Dragon?
.
Do you think he can do it?
Let's wait for tonight.
And observe his work.
Mom...
Malek...
Why haven't you come back home, son?
You don't love me anymore?
.
No, mom.
I'm just afraid that you're still angry with me.
That's why.
Come back home, Malek.
I'm old... and I have nobody now to take care of me.
Just come back home ok.
I miss you so much, my son.
Now Dragon's doggy is looking after Malek.
You're such scumbag, do you know that?
.!
We haven't settledTony's issues, now you want to meddle into mine.
What's your problem?
.
Oh no, the smelly guy is here already!
You often eat while you're still in the toilet?
That's whyyou always backstab people!
What do you want from Malek?
.
I want him to suffer!
Suffer?
He's already dead!
Don't you realize that?
He's not dead enough to me...
I want him to be really dead.
I won't leave him alone ifhe's still in KL.
You shouldn't be worry about him...
You should worry about keeping your life first.
Hey Shark!
Do you have a gun?
Shoot me now!
Or do you have a machete or iron rod?
.
Hit me now until I'm dead!
Are you brave enough?
If this is not your already, I've already slashed you!
You talktoo much!
Come kill me now!
I'm also bored to see your face already!
Hey Shark!
Ifyou touch Malek, I'll hityou back!
You wantto hit me?
.
Do not talk like a lunatic!
Let's see who dies first!
What?
He said that I'm a lunatic?
.!
Mom...
I think after this you don't have to work anymore.
It is ok, Malek.
I'm used to it already.
Furthermore, you're not earning much yet.
I know that, but I pity you.
You should just stay at home and rest.
Besides, you are not in the best of health.
Ifl don't work, who would take care of this family?
.
We're not wealthy, son.
I don't want to burden my children.
I knowthat you're disappointed with me.
I've not been a good son all these while.
I knowthat because of our wrongdoings, you have to do all this work alone.
Please forgive me mom.
Malek, I've already forgiven you.
No matter how bad you are, you are still my son.
But I only ask for one thing, please change your behavior ok.
Please don't repeatyour past mistakes again.
Do wait for a while ok...
Where are you going now?
.
Haven't you had enough?
.
Can't you see that mom's in need of our help?
.
Hey, are you listening or not?
Ifl hear thatyou're doing that illegal business again, just be prepared...
Don't meddle into my business anymore!
I'm no longer a child...
I know what I'm doing!
Whatever happens toyou, I'll be responsible.
Aren't you ashamed that all the people out there thinkthat you're already spoiled?
!
Yes, I'm spoilt!
But do you know why I become like this?
Do you know that after you're gone, we had a hard life?
.!
Those days, almost every day, there were gangsters who came here looking for you.
And since they couldn't find you, I became their target.
I had to bear all those sufferings!
It's all because of you!
Is this true, mom?
.
Did those people trouble you?
Please tell me whothey were.
That's why I hate to have an elder brother like you!
Hey, that's a cute girl!
Wow, she even looked at me!
That is bad!
Oh no!
Please forgive me God!
Bro, doyou have here phone number?
.
You don't, right?
Thank God!
But I'm here to inform you about this car.
I'm renting it for RM50 per day...
I'm broke!
Anyways, the guys are waiting for us.
Let's go!
Why are you cracking your head thinking about Malek?
He's not interested to join us.
He wants to become a good citizen.
To hell with that!
Hey, please don't get confused ok!
I'm concerned not because ofwanting him to join us...
But Malek and I are like brothers, understand!
Do you know why Malekwas sent to prison?
.
Do you?
.
It's because of Shark.
Shark's really bad!
Why does he envy Malek so much?
Why can't he be happywith what he has?
Because he's afraid!
You guys do not know how tight Malekwith King was last time.
Theywere both big shots!
But Shark backstabbed!
Do you know that?
.
You guys don't know this.
Ajib, that's Jai.
Butwhy is Jai with Shark's guys?
.
That, I do not know.
Jai, this is bad!
What are you doing?
!
You dare to join Shark?
Do you want to die?
.
I don't care!
He can pay me!
I don't want to live in poverty like you!
Hey stupid!
Don't you realize that he's just using you?
.!
When he gains his power, he'll stab you in the back like what he did to me...
Do you want that?
!
Let's go Jai!
I'm not as stupid as you!
You, mind your own business!
I mind my own!
Let's go!
Don't disperse yet!
I want you to get Malek, tonight!
I'm going there now!
Ifyou plan to get Jai out of the group, do you think Sharkwill just let it happen easily?
.
Surely he will get involved.
Do you wantto be trapped again?
.
Can't you thinkwisely?
The problem now is that...
Since he cannot get me, so he came for my brother.
Do you think I should keep quiet and let my brother stray away?
.
I need to find a wayto settle this...
What?
You can just forget about settling this!
The carthat was blown up, it was my car not yours!
Do you want him to blow up my house the next time around?
Or blow up my girlfriends' houses?
.
Can't you think straight?
If it was just me and you me, who's going to be a big brother soon...
You should forget about pursuing this.
I'm not afraid...
But I just don't know how to retaliate now.
My family's is at stake now, do you know that?
.!
Calm down Malek!
I'm willing to die ifthey dare to touch my family!
Hey, I thought that you'll be better when you are out.
But it seems that you are getting worse!
Just shut up and go!
I knowthat...
Are you guys blind?
.!
Damn you guys!
Oh no, they're gangsters!
What's happening?
.
No!
Help me God!
Get out now!
Hey, what's this?
!
I'm hurt, please!
Hey, please release him!
What do you want to do now?
.
This is the only way to make you remember!
You have crashed into King's place!
And you are backing up Dragon?
.!
Is that the way it is?
.
Have you lived long enough?
My life or death is not in your hands, you scumbag!
What happened to Dragon has got nothing to do with me.
Now you have got my brother involved in this!
And you still want me to keep quiet?
.!
Let me die first, and then I'll be quiet for sure!
You are talking as ifyou're bored oflife already.
You thinkyou're such a big gangster, you can go against me?
!
.
I don't care how big you are, whoever has the money rules!
This KL is my territory!
...
I own KL!
Just give this KL to him!
Let him go!
Jai, your brother has ruined our plans...
If he always interferes, we might get nothing.
As at now, we still have to finish our job.
Just attack Dragon's guys...
You guys do not have to interfere on the issue between me and my brother.
You have to understand...
Ajib is his friend.
If anyone touches him, surely Ajib will come to the rescue.
I'm shaking now.
I can't even sleep properly.
Who will bear this now?
.
We'll crash into anybody!
Ifyou can't handle it, just let me do it.
Are you making sense?
Do you intent to destroyyour brother just because Shark paid you to?
But of course!
Shark is not paying me alone, he's paying you guys too!
Siblings or not, whoever interferes will pay!
Why did you detain Malek?
.
Why?
!
Why do you hate him so much?
!
I don't hate him, but he was interfering with my plans.
Why do you want to protect him so much?
Who is he?
.!
If it is not because of him, you won't be here!
It was me and him that had developed this place!
You don't touch him!
You're sidelining your own son because of an outsider?
!
Do you know that he's working for Dragon?
.
And yet, you still want me to keep quiet?
!
If it's true that he's working for Dragon, that's his choice.
I have no issues with Dragon!
It's you who's been creating chaos!
So you want him to join Dragon and become stronger?
And Dragon will eat us all?
.
Do you want that to happen?
.
Do you thinkwho you're talking too?
.
Don't become big headed!
Ifyou wantto become big headed, you go!
Leave this place!
You're no more welcomed in this group!
I don't want to see your face here anymore!
Get lost!
I want Malek!
I want to bury him!
Just don't tell Jai about this.
But King's protecting Malek...
How is it?
You can pray later!
Why are you crying?
.!
Are you afraid of me?
!
Yes...
I'm afraid.
Now, just tell me the whereabouts of your son!
I want to slaughter him today!
Please no!
You want to see me go mad, right?
.!
Today I'll go berserk!
Don't do this to me, I'm innocent!
I'm old... please forgive me!
Malek!
Who can help you now?
!
.
Malek, help me please!
Who?
Onlyyour son's soul can settle the score today!
Ifl still can't find your son, I'll torture you alive!
I heard that your son's a big gangster right?
I want him to realize who the bigger gangster is now!
Auntie!
Shark!
Please don't do this...
Are you out of your mind?
.
Have you no heart?
.
Where's Malek?
Even ifyou have a big feud with Malek, please don't get his mother involved!
You should just settle with him!
I askyou where's Malek?
.!
Oh no!
Malek!
Remember your prayers son!
Malek!
Help us!
Fadil!
I had fun playing with you!
I'm sorry big brother!
I feel sad watching you like this.
Do you think I do not knowwhatyou'd done to my mother?
I know!
I've waited for this moment for a long time.
Now I'll let you rest for a long time.
When the time comes, I'll send you flowers.
Shark's getting really crazy now!
He had hurt Fadil earlier.
He had killed King too.
What he wants to do, that's his problem.
It's none of your business.
If nobody disturbs him, I'm sure he'd be ok.
Can't you see it Jai?
Ifhe's even willing to kill his own stepfather, do you think he'll be ok with us?
For all you know, he'll come to destroy us anytime!
So how?
Why are you lecturing me?
Have you guys already forgotten the investments
Shark's made onto you guys?
!
It seems that all of you have forgotten your roots too easily!
That's their own problem, so just let them be!
Let's just work as usual.
And why are you so scared suddenly?
Ifyou still want to follow Shark, that's your decision...
Butwe want to be out ofit!
I don't care ifyou guys are not with me on this!
But I want to see ifyou guys can still survive without me!
Don't come backto me begging from me to take you back!
It's sad!
Shark... has attacked Fadil.
I want to return into the gang.
I also require some help.
Malek, it's not my problem if anyone dies!
You and your brother are the same, only know how to cause trouble!
Dragon, this is just a small matter!
We should help him.
You keep your mouth shut!
This is not our problem!
Hey Malek!
Do you know thatyour brother has tricked me too many times?
!
And yetyou want me to help you?
!
You should just get out from here and don't disturb us here!
Just go!
Dragon...
Shark has already'crossed' us.
And Jai is causing a lot of problems.
We're not really helping Malek...
It's Malekwho'll be helping us to attack Jai and Shark!
Let's drink!
I'm watching your back, bro!
Your opponent should be me, not him!
You want to fight me because of money?
!
You're more concerned about this crook than your own family?
!
.
Yes, he's more important!
His enemy is my enemy!
That's enough Jai!
Don't force me!
Yes, I can still keep my sting!
Besides, I'm already tired...
Are you satisfied now?
!
Are you?
!
.
Or do you want more!
?
What more do you want?
!
Tell me!
Tell me!
Hey, ifyou want to die, it won't be by my hands!
What are you waiting for?
Just kill me...
I am your brother!
No matter how horrible you have become I still care for you because you are my brother!
My flesh and blood!
You stupid...!
After the incident, I became a fugitive...
My brother Jai disappeared.
King's gang was then destroyed and Dragon dominated the streets ofKL.
But his reign was short-lived, when he was caught by the police.
I was caught too...
I have nothing else to settle now but to seek forgiveness from my mom and God.
1,400 years ago, a man born here in Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, changed the course of world history.
If you had to rate the top people in the history of the world as leaders, the name of Muhammad would be in the top three.
Here we have a man who began a mission.
He gave light to the world.
For one and a half billion Muslims, he is the last and greatest of that long line of prophets who have brought the word of God to humanity.
He was not just a spiritual genius, but he also had political gifts of a very high order.
He laid the foundations for a religion, Islam, that after his death developed a culture and civilization that spread around the world and inspired some of the most beautiful architecture.
But today, Islam is at the very heart of the conflict that defines our world, and Muhammad's name is associated with some of the most appalling acts of terrorism the world has ever seen.
Osama Bin Laden and others who have committed acts of Jihad terrorism
Osama Bin Laden and others who have committed acts of Jihad terrorism consistently invoke the Qur'an and Muhammad's example to justify what they are doing.
Obedience to one true God, Allah, and follow in the footsteps of the final prophet and messenger, Muhammad.
Outside the Islamic world, almost nothing is known about Muhammad, whereas for Muslims, he is the ultimate role model, and his life is known in every detail.
So, who was he?
What was his message?
And why are so many people, Muslims and non-Muslims, divided over his legacy?
In this groundbreaking series,
I will explore the many complexities of his life story, about the revelations he is said to have received from God, about his many wives, about his relations with the Jews of Arabia, about his use of war and peace,
and about the laws that he enacted when he set up his own state.
I want to examine his life and times and understand how they still affect today's world, and whether they are a force for good or evil.
I want to uncover the real Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, peace be upon him.
Muhammad was born in Mecca in the year 570, into the ruling tribe of the city, the Quraysh.
According to Muslim tradition, at the age of 40,
Muhammad received a revelation from God, the first of many that would later become the Qur'an, the sacred text of Islam.
He preached a new message that Allah was the one God, that he, Muhammad, was his messenger, and that all human beings would account for their behaviour on the Day of Judgement.
He slowly built up a small band of followers, from his family, friends and the marginalised sections of Meccan society.
But it was not a message that was always welcome.
Right from the start, Muhammad's new message brought him into conflict with the rulers of Mecca - his own tribe, the Quraysh, who saw him as a direct threat to their control of the city.
By the time of Muhammad's birth, the Kaaba had long been a shrine drawing people to the town of Mecca, the centre of pagan cults for the people of Arabia.
For 13 years, Muhammad and his small band of followers endured increasingly brutal persecution at the hands of the Quraysh, until they were forced to leave Mecca and begin a new life in the city of Medina.
Muhammad's new-found power at the head of Medina's Jewish and pagan tribes threatened the Quraysh's status as Arabia's pre-eminent tribe.
Several times, they tried to crush Muhammad and his followers by force.
In the final battle, it's alleged that one of Medina's Jewish tribes switched allegiances, and in retaliation, all the Jewish men of that tribe were massacred on charge of treason.
It was one of the most controversial incidents in Muhammad's life.
With the ending of the siege of Medina,
Muhammad had overcome the most powerful Arab army ever assembled against them and, once again, he had humiliated his Quraysh opponents.
He had seen off all local opposition to his rule and, what's more, he'd ensured the survival of the Muslim community here in Medina.
He was by now arguably the most powerful man in all of Arabia.
The revelations Muhammad received would go on to form the Muslim holy book, The Qur'an.
They came to him throughout his life, and every time they occurred, it was a terrifying and exhausting experience.
He frequently had to struggle to make sense of them.
Some came as words, others as visions that needed intense concentration to understand their meaning.
He would always say that "never once did I receive a revelation
"without feeling that my soul had been torn from my body."
He'd go pale, and he'd sweat, even on a cold day.
It's an effort to speak the word of God.
For me, the Prophet has got that sort of terrifying, brief access to divine power, and he is using that consciousness that sort of flooded into his body, and creating the words.
Muhammad is born into an age where it is taken for granted that the veil which obscures the dimension of the heavenly, the dimension of the angelic, can be penetrated by men of peculiar vision or holiness, and this is taken for granted
by Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian holy men.
And it's why people are able to accept his assurance that he is receiving revelations from God.
It is why they are able to accept it.
This kind of spiritual experience is not normally associated with Islam.
One Muslim group, though, the Sufis, claim to try to replicate Muhammad's mystical experience of God through intense prayer, the chanting of God's name and singing verses from the Qur'an.
TRANSLATION:
When Prophet Muhammad was saying his prayers, while he was mediating and communicating with God, he used to hear the divine instructions and then act.
That's why in Sufism, and in Islam, we also try to come close to God.
Through our rituals, we try and be one with Him.
Prophet Muhammad is an example of this.
Whatever he did during his prayers or during his daily life is there for us to take example.
The Sufis have developed their own elaborate rituals and techniques and, here in Turkey, they even dance.
Although there is no evidence to suggest that Muhammad followed these rituals, the Sufis see him as an inspiration for their spiritual experience.
The Prophet as a perfect human is very much a part of both theological and Sufi traditions in Islam.
His perfection lies in the fact that it is only through him that one can know God.
At the centre of the ceremony is the practice of zikr, or the repeated lyrical chanting of God's name, to bring people closer to God.
CHANTING MALE VOICE SINGS
The chanting is followed by a particularly Turkish Sufi practice to induce a trance-like condition through dance.
Every religion generates its own diversity of spiritual practices.
Islam is no exception.
We have a number of different spiritual traditions, of which Sufism is but one.
Now, the Prophet prayed, he meditated, he contemplated, but he also said, "Pray, but tie your camel".
That means praying itself is not good enough.
You have to do good.
You have to create a healthy, better society at the same time.
Anybody who follows this spiritual tradition and does good, and the emphasis on doing good is very, very important, is, in fact, following the way of Muhammad.
But Muhammad's spiritual experiences were firmly rooted in the practical necessities of life.
He was not someone who retired from the world, but worked continually to reform Arabian society.
Instead of simply waiting for paradise at the end of the world,
Muhammad tried to create his own ideal society in his own lifetime.
By 627AD Muhammad had become a powerful ruler in Medina, but by all accounts, in his personal habits and way of life, he remained modest.
He continued to live next to his small mosque that served both as a place of worship and a centre for his work.
Everyone was free to enter and speak with him
- Jews, Christians, non-believers, even slaves.
Reading the accounts, it is clear he is a very charismatic figure.
He is a person that numerous people came to for advice.
Constantly came for advice.
But it was not just that he was dispensing sage advice, he was always listening to people.
He comes out as a very humane and warm person.
I think Muhammad does come across in many different contexts as being quite gentle, quite reluctant to find fault.
He seemed a very fair individual.
Muslim sources talk of his simple taste in clothes and his dislike of gold or silk or other luxuries.
He did not care for possessions and gave much away in charity or as gifts.
I haven't personally detected any sign that Muhammad was guided by power.
I think his integrity remained intact.
He was scrupulous over any corruption or financial issues.
I think he stood out as a kind of exemplary human being who could combine that moral vision with the requirements of being a leader of a growing organization.
He is a searcher.
A searcher for truth and understanding throughout his life, and he's a man who used the magic of his own language.
He was a genius of the Arab people, infused it with something worldwide, to make something that humankind could understand.
Muhammad received revelations throughout his life, but between Mecca and Medina their content changed significantly.
Whereas in Mecca the revelations dealt with inward principles of spirituality and faith, here in Medina the revelations would be far more practical.
They provided a blueprint for how one should live life on a day-to-day basis as a Muslim, from the social to the political - a blueprint that many Muslims try to follow today.
Whilst in Mecca, he is very much a religious preacher.
He talks much more about issues such as the end of time.
You know, it's about morality, about justice and these kinds of things.
Once he moves to Medina, he is the functioning leader of a community.
He therefore has to get much more involved in the day-to-day running of a community, how people interact with each other, how people manage inheritance, how people greet each other, even.
The revelations could be quite explicit - all Muslims should pay a tax to support the sick and needy.
Or they could be general guidelines about how to treat others to promote justice and human dignity.
Muhammad used these principles in deciding matters brought to him as the ruler of Medina.
Over time, a moral code was revealed to Muhammad, based on ideas of social justice for all.
In the Qur'an, it was called Sharia or 'the way to know God'.
We have three verses where the concept is revealed in one way or another, in one form or another.
And, in fact, what was understood by the Prophet and his companions is that what they were trying to implement was, in fact, this way towards God.
So, this is why we have a problem of defining the word because the scholars afterward defined Sharia as God's law, but because they were jurists, so for them Sharia is all about law.
But what he was doing is just promoting, you know, brotherhood, justice, equality, freedom.
This is Sharia, in fact.
What is known today as Sharia law, the sacred law of Islam, is very different.
It only came into existence two centuries after Muhammad's death, when Muslim legal experts devised a legal code to help run the ever-expanding Islamic Empire.
They used a mixture of Qur'anic teachings and examples from Muhammad's life.
Many Muslims now regard that version of Sharia as the unalterable law of God.
The underlying principles of Islamic law appear in the Qur'an, and there are detailed regulations relating to very specific areas, such as inheritance, which you do find in the Qur'an.
But the Sharia itself is a human edifice constructed over time.
It's man's attempt to understand God's will and implement it.
But there are divergent views within the Sharia, there are contradictory rulings, and so it is certainly not a code sent down directly from God.
It's something much more flexible and fluid, and adaptive to circumstance.
In Medina, Muhammad made many radical changes to the customs of his tribal past.
He abolished the brutal tradition of blood feuds.
Women acquired a share in inheritance and secured rights to own property.
But the Qur'an also ordered more traditional penalties, such as the amputation of limbs for stealing, although there is no evidence that Muhammad ever did this.
Many of these punishments still form part of Sharia law today.
There was the practice of female infanticide in 7th-century Arabia.
So, if you had a daughter and didn't want to take care of her for 13 or 15 years, until someone's going to marry her, you toss her out into the desert and she would die.
Muhammad put an end to that.
Muhammad put an emphasis on helping orphans and widows.
We would look at that and say, great, that's a great teaching.
But, certainly, we find many teachings that we would consider barbaric by today's standards.
Stoning of adulterers and adulteresses, chopping off body parts of those who steal things.
These are certain things I would regard as backwards.
Today, because we are facing the West, because we are having a very narrow understanding, we come with something that Sharia is, how we are going to implement very narrow understanding of what a marriage is, of what punishments are,
and I think that this is not the way.
And this is why I am saying today if I am speaking about Sharia,
I live in the West and in the West, we have laws where you and me, we are equal before law.
This is my Sharia.
This is where we have to come with a better, a deeper understanding of the very essence of Sharia.
Some Muslim states, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, base their entire legal system on Sharia law, with punishments that many regard as medieval in their brutality.
So, calls by Muslim extremists to introduce Sharia law in Europe and in Britain have led to street protests and the rise of political parties campaigning against what they see as the spread of Islamic influence.
This is the problem - that in the 21st century, we still have nations who are beheading people, who are cutting the limbs off people, cutting the hands and feet.
There are women today being stoned to death by the government for sexual violations, not for murder.
It's not for a crime of taking someone else's life.
It's an inhumane way of killing.
All these people who are stoning the people and are just starting with punishments say this is Sharia.
I say no, that's not Sharia.
This is the way you are instrumentalising religion for your own sake.
I have one question.
How have you been elected?
Are you elected?
Are you representing the people?
Let me start with the first question because you have no legitimacy, no way for you to implement this in the name of Islam, if you are not legitimate.
Many of the people who do, and start with this, are not really elected, and are not chosen by the people, so their own status, it's important.
And then there is a second question, what about social justice?
What about equal rights?
What about education?
Are you going to punish people without educating them?
Is this Islam?
No.
Islam is starting with education.
And as for the punishment, it's another story.
Don't start with punishment, start with dignity and rights.
Not with punishment, because punishment is the way you instrumentalise religion just to make yourself be legitimate while you are not.
Like all law, Sharia law, at least in theory, is supposed to be a changing, evolving institution, but what we have under the rubric of Sharia law today is actually frozen in history.
It is the interpretations of jurists undertaken during the 8th and 9th century.
That is what we call Sharia law.
That's why wherever Sharia law is implemented it recreates the conditions of the 8th and 9th century.
What the Muslims need to do is to reformulate Sharia law, and this reformulation has to be continuous and constant.
Because the word Sharia itself means "the way to the watering hole".
Why do you go to the watering hole?
To drink water.
It is something that we need to drink all the time.
That means it has to be refreshed, rethought and reformulated from epoch to epoch.
It was now 627 AD.
Muhammad had a secure power base in Medina.
Although he had frustrated all the efforts of his enemies, the Quraysh, to destroy him, they were still powerful and in control of Mecca.
If Muhammad was to succeed in bringing his message to all the people of Arabia, he had to find a solution to break this stalemate.
One of the key lessons from the battles for Muhammad was that he was going to find it very difficult to overcome the Meccans militarily.
He had to try to undermine them politically.
What he needed was to strike alliances with other tribes across Arabia.
And one of the key ways of doing this was through marriage.
For Muhammad's critics, his polygamous marriages have always been a problem.
But at that time in Arabia, polygamy was the norm, and it wasn't until after the death of his first wife that Muhammad had several wives at the same time.
Some accounts say nine, others 11 or 13.
Some were widows.
Some were women captured after battles who, by marrying him, were granted their freedom.
One was even a Christian Coptic slave presented to him by the Byzantine ruler of Egypt.
But his most controversial marriage was to the daughter of his closest companion, a young girl called Aisha.
According to some sources,
Aisha is supposed to have been betrothed at age six or seven, then formally married at nine.
Other accounts make her older, nearly 16 or 17.
It's this lack of clarity that has left Muhammad open to serious condemnation from many critics.
If you are a 53-year-old man, and you take a nine-year-old girl into your bed and consummate the marriage, it is not all right.
Not only from the standpoint of 21st-century morality of the Western world, but of, what one might say, natural morality of most societies, most of the time.
My position on this is that she was older.
She was between 16 and 18, and not six and nine.
So these are scholars of today, but not today, in fact last century, trying to get a sense of that might be.
We are repeating this, but this is not really true, it is not something which is in the Qur'an, is in the prophetic tradition, and we have to check about this, and I would say that age here is problematic in itself.
Muhammad's marriage to Aisha lasted till his death.
And she later became a prominent political leader in her own right.
Muslim historians claim that it was her differences with Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law Ali that eventually led to the great schism in Islam between the Sunni and the Shia sects.
The real point in this, and that is lost in all this argument, is who was Aisha - what did she become?
She grew up in the Prophet's household to become a really feisty, independent, intelligent, politically aware woman.
And she is a foundation of our understanding of the Prophet's life.
Without Aisha, half of what we know of the Prophet disappears.
A series of further revelations defined Islamic marriage.
They also provided Muhammad's critics with more ammunition, as they said that while Muhammad was allowed to keep all his wives, in future, Muslim men would only be allowed a maximum of four wives, as long as they could support them and treat them all equally.
We have to understand the Prophet Muhammad in the context of his time.
Pagan Arabia is a place where there is unlimited polygamy, that is the normal practice.
Islam comes, and limits that polygamy.
For Muslims, it is limited to four wives.
The Prophet is allowed, and the Prophet is previously married up to nine wives.
He is also prohibited from adding any more to that number, but those wives that he is married to, he is allowed to keep.
And there is a simple reason for that - the importance of building tribal alliances.
This is very, very important.
The Prophet is not only a prophet, he is a leader of his people and building those alliances is hugely important.
Now, the justification for Muhammad having more wives is sura 33:50, which gave Muhammad, and only Muhammad, permission to marry as many women as he wanted to marry, and we have to be somewhat sceptical.
So many people have claimed to be prophets, when we look at a prophet and his revelations give him more sexual partners than anyone else is allowed to have, I say we have some reason for suspicion here.
It would be entirely mistaken to imagine the Prophet basking decadently in a garden of earthly delights.
These are political marriages.
He marries Aisha because he wants to bind himself more closely with their fathers.
He's creating a new community, not based on tribe or blood, but somehow, this helps to make the transition easier, if you make a marriage link.
We know from Muslim sources that some of Muhammad's marriages even caused him problems during his own lifetime.
For example, when he married the divorced wife of his adopted son, his enemies spread rumours that it was an incestuous relationship in an attempt to divide the Muslim community.
His marriage to his former daughter in law, Zaynab bint Jahsh, when he married her, it's clear that there were protests from the community and people thought that this was a shocking, scandalising kind of thing for him to have done.
According to the sources, Muhammad faced another marital crisis when Aisha went missing during a journey.
She was eventually found and brought back to Medina by a man who had known her before her marriage to Muhammad.
Again, his enemies spread rumours that something scandalous must have happened between them.
According to Muslim tradition,
Muhammad himself was at first unsure who to believe, but, eventually, after a new revelation from God, he accepted Aisha's protestations of innocence.
At that time in Arabia, adulterers were traditionally stoned to death.
This new revelation defined how any future allegations of adultery should be dealt with, and, surprisingly, in complete contrast to the extreme views held by groups like the Taliban.
The punishment of stoning to death was borrowed from Christianity and Judaism.
From the Old Testament, of course, as we know.
In the Qur'an, punishment for having sex outside marriage is lashing 100 times on your backside.
Only if it can be proven that four people have seen the act of penetration, which is very difficult to prove.
Muhammad's wives lived with him in specially built rooms adjoining the courtyard of his mosque in Medina.
It was a very busy public place, and privacy was hard to find.
With the continual attempts of Muhammad's enemies to create division, the potential for future scandal was always there, so something had to be done.
One day Muhammad received a new revelation that instructed his wives to cover themselves to maintain their modesty.
This act of veiling or covering has had a profound effect on Muslim women and, also, how the outside world views Islam's attitudes to women in general.
There are injunctions about the Prophet's wives wearing some kind of covering.
It's not exactly clear what that covering is, but it's to distinguish them.
And this is all part and parcel of the difficult divisions in Medina, because Muhammad's enemies in Medina were using his wives to discredit him and so some kind of distinction needed to be made, but veiling was not for all women.
Today, the veil is seen by Islam's critics as symbolic of its attitude to women in general and its desire to oppress them.
But the more universal veiling of women did not become an Islamic custom until more than 100 years after Muhammad's death.
As far as the religion is concerned, there is a requirement of modesty for both men and women, but how you fulfil that requirement is open to debate.
I don't feel I am compromising myself as a Muslim by not wearing the hijab, and I certainly don't not wear it, because I am trying to say that I am not a serious Muslim.
You can't judge the seriousness of someone's faith and belief by what they wear.
Over the last 20 years, in Britain as in many Western countries, the veil has become a form of identity for many Muslim women.
Some just cover their hair, others their entire face.
It is a controversial issue, with some European countries now banning women from using the veil.
Fatima Barkatullah is a writer on Islamic women.
Fatima, are you wearing the veil because you are obliged to because of your family, or do you do it out of free will?
For me it is absolutely 100% free will.
It's very much about a spiritual journey and about wanting to be the best I can be, in God's eyes.
When I'm getting ready in the morning to go out,
I will just cover what I would normally be wearing, you know, whether it's jeans or whatever I am wearing, with something like this.
Which is a gown, essentially, isn't it?
Yes.
It's an outer garment.
People call it the abaya or the jilbab.
And then I wear this, which is a khimar, or a scarf.
And then I wear this small face veil.
This is very much my public face, if you like.
But why do you choose to wear the full face covering as opposed to this, the khimar, the scarf, which you see a lot of other Muslim women wearing, as well?
I believe that the more modest I can be, the more of a virtue it is.
So, essentially, I'm doing it to please God.
Where do you think this comes from?
Is it in the Qur'an?
Is it in the...
Yes, you'll find it in the Qur'an.
The verse in Surat Ahzab clearly says, "O Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters
"and the women of the believers," meaning the Muslim women, when they go out of their homes they should wear their outer garments, and the word in Arabic is jalabeeb, which has two orthodox interpretations.
That's the point.
This is all an interpretation.
There isn't anywhere in the Qur'an which says it is a rule for Muslim women that they must wear a veil.
It's in the interpretation.
As far as the face is concerned, there is some difference of opinion.
The one verse that specifically does deal with clothing actually says cover your nakedness, not shroud yourself in a black bag.
Now, Muslim women have interpreted it,
Muslim men have interpolated practices from other societies into the interpretation of the religion, and identity politics has a great deal to do with it.
But I say women should be free to choose, but there is no compulsion, and there is no requirement for them to veil themselves.
Despite the best efforts of his enemies to discredit him through his marriages,
Muhammad had used them to confirm and widen his power base in Arabia.
He could now turn his attention again to Mecca.
In early 628 AD, he told his followers that they were going to set out to perform the annual Hajj rites at the Kaaba in Mecca.
For Muhammad and his followers, the Kaaba had become central to their worship, the place to which they turned in prayer.
They believed it had been originally built by the Prophet Abraham, and regarded it as the ultimate symbol of their faith, the unity of the one God, Allah.
But access to the Kaaba was controlled by Muhammad's enemies, the Quraysh, the rulers of Mecca.
It contained shrines to the hundreds of gods worshipped by all the tribes in Arabia.
Muhammad was now determined to challenge their control of this sacred shrine.
The Prophet announces that he is going to make the Hajj.
It must have been astonishing because on the Hajj you are not allowed to carry weapons.
He was going unarmed into the enemy territory.
It's when, again, you touch the magic of Muhammad as a man.
He fought wars and now he just said, right, we're off to pray to God.
Muhammad and the convoy of followers were forced to stop here at Hudaibiya, which is about eight miles outside of the Holy City, because the Quraysh had reacted with characteristic aggression and they had sent a cavalry in order to stop the convoy.
And so began a series of frenetic negotiations with emissaries going between Muhammad and the Quraysh.
They eventually arrived at an agreement, but the so-called Treaty of Hudaibiya, signed at a spot marked by the mosque just behind me, looked like the most humiliating of compromises for Muhammad.
The Quraysh insisted that Muhammad and his followers return to Medina without performing the Hajj rites.
They also insisted that all raids on Meccan caravans by the Muslim forces under Muhammad's command should stop.
In return, they would allow Muhammad and his followers to return to Mecca as pilgrims to perform the Hajj, but only in the following year.
And when it came to signing the documents which describes Muhammad as "the Messenger of God", the Quraysh emissary objected, saying that to them he was only "Muhammad, the son of Abdullah".
For Muhammad's followers, this was an unbearable insult.
According to Muslim tradition, when Muhammad's young cousin Ali, who was doing the writing, heard this he refused to strike out the words "the Messenger of God".
Muhammad says, "Give me the pen" - point out the words "Messenger of God", and he strikes it out himself.
I see it as a striking out of ego there, not standing on your rights.
The Qur'an says that if the enemy asks for peace you must lay down your arms immediately and accept any terms, however disadvantageous.
For Muhammad's followers, the terms of this treaty, and the treatment of Muhammad, were completely humiliating.
It was only Muhammad's adamant attitude that kept them from mutiny.
What Muhammad was trying to do was totally unheard of in 7th-century Arabia.
In a society of honour, traditionally, blood feuds ruled the day.
But after years of bloody but inconclusive conflict, Muhammad now wanted to defeat his enemies not through war, but by peace.
By signing a truce with the Quraysh, he had not only gained access to the Kaaba, albeit at a later date, but also extracted from them the crucial acknowledgement that he and they were now equals.
In a sense, the Hudaibiya does represent a minimal option, which is,
OK, we can't get what we want now, but we can get it in the future, if we make this agreement.
And a truce in which people were not fighting was always preferable to war.
This is, again, something which is Qur'anically given, that, you know, peace is better than war.
It's repeated again and again.
So, it very much fits within that particular type of principle.
As he and his followers were returning to Medina,
Muhammad received a new revelation, confirming that the Treaty of Hudaibiya was a not a humiliating defeat.
He said, "I've just had a revelation.
This was a manifest victory, says God.
"It may have looked like a defeat, but it was a manifest victory."
The Quraysh were filled with all the violence of the old tribal spirit.
They were filled with contempt and pride.
It was the Muslims, the spirit of peace that filled their hearts.
Sometimes this is forgotten.
We hear all about Muhammad's wars, but we forget this extraordinary, non-violent offensive.
After Hudaibiya, the tide had turned in his favour with a campaign of non-violence.
A primary vehicle that Muhammad did use was diplomacy at the time.
He went out, visited the tribes, engaged with major religious leaders, attempted to form pacts, created, if you look at the community at Medina, created a space for other faiths and other people.
But when faced with resistance or aggression, did exactly what the standards of the time would have legitimated.
And I think that that is clearly there.
You do not see the Prophet consistently calling for wholesale killing of all those who disagreed with him.
The Treaty of Hudaibiya marks a turning point in Muhammad's attempts to spread his message throughout Arabia.
But it also shows that he was prepared to suffer the utmost humiliation from his worst enemies in pursuit of peace.
And yet in today's world, the most commonly held views of Muhammad is that he is the enemy of peace, and that Islam is the religion of Jihad, commonly taken to mean "Holy War".
Thousands have been killed all over the world by groups that are now called Jihadi, a term never used in Muhammad's time.
And yet, these groups all claim the Qur'an and Muhammad himself as inspiration and justification for their actions.
It is very clear, brothers and sisters, that the path of Jihad and the desire for martyrdom was deeply embedded in the Holy Prophet and their beloved companions.
Most so called Jihadis usually refer to a verse in the Qur'an, now known as the Sword Verse, as justification for their violent acts.
If you come back to the Qur'an, you have these verses, no one can deny that there are verses very, very much dealing with war and violence.
Now, as we have to deal with the Qur'an, it's an eternal book dealing with history.
These verses were revealed in a very specific period of time when the Muslims were under oppression and trying to resist and just to survive.
So, we have to contextualise this.
The mainstream classical tradition, in the Shia and the Sunni tradition, are saying you can't use these verses just to promote war and to kill innocent people, this is wrong.
The interpretation of individual Qur'anic verses goes to the heart of this controversy, but most scholars now agree that the term Jihad does not mean Holy War.
Its real meaning is completely different.
The concept of Jihad emerges out of the Holy Qur'an, out of the revelation that the Prophet receives.
And there are about 35 examples in the Qur'an of the word "jihad", or the term basically being used, and often in the case of striving.
Now striving can be all sorts of things.
It can be striving against the baseness of oneself.
It can be a seeking to overcome evil and being good.
It can be striving in the sense of fighting.
But Jihad is always distinguished from fighting, and a different terminology is used for the word "fighting".
In all the battles that Muhammad fought, the rules of engagement were always carefully delineated within the context of his time and what was generally acceptable.
But there are no recorded instances of deliberate attacks on civilian populations.
One of the points about Jihad in the early Islamic tradition, both in the Prophet's lifetime and afterwards, is that it's is a gradual evolution of an idea towards something like a just war.
And the just war is a constraint on the army, does not attack or massacre the civilians, doesn't kill women or children, doesn't kill priests of other religions incidentally, and so on.
And this draws on the practice in the lifetime of the Prophet.
These rules of engagement appear to have been forgotten by today's Muslim extremists.
Suicide bombers kill people not only in Western cities, but also in mosques and other places of worship in the Muslim world itself.
In Britain today, no Muslim activist or group will openly defy the law by accepting or agreeing to the use of violence.
But over the last 10 years, more than 200 Muslims have been convicted of terrorist-related offences.
In 2008, Abdul Muhid was convicted and jailed for two years for terrorist funding.
Mizanur Rahman was charged for soliciting murder and jailed for four years in 2006.
Both have now served their sentences, but still have strong views about the role of Jihad in today's world.
Has the modern interpretation of Jihad changed in any way?
Because, for most people today, Jihad means just one thing doesn't it, it means fighting and the physical struggle?
The scholars of Islam in the past, they all agreed that Jihad means fighting against the non-Muslims, yes, but not just for the sake of forcing them to be Muslim, but to make the word of Allah
the highest by removing obstacles from the implementation of the Sharia and for the call to Islam to spread across the world.
From your interpretation of the Prophet's life, is it permittable at any time in Jihad to attack non-combatants?
If I just cut straight to the point, the argument of Islamic terrorists is this, if you choose a government that represents you and they decide to bomb a country or kill people, then you have blood on your hands.
It's like hiring, for example, a murderer.
If I pay a murderer to go and kill someone it's not just the murderer who is blameworthy.
I share that blame.
So, if you say by non-combatants, these people voted for a government that is carrying out crimes, then they share the blame.
And, obviously in the eyes of the Islamic terrorists, they are blameworthy.
These ideas are abhorrent to Muslims and non-Muslims, and would have been unrecognisable to Muhammad.
For him, the concept of Jihad was not just simply about killing and war, but it was about striving to improve yourself in the eyes of God.
There is the concept of just war in Islam, and Muhammad himself fought many battles, but for him, there was no justification of the killing of innocent people.
The Qur'an verses that talk about fighting and defending yourself don't legitimize killing yourself deliberately and killing others in that process.
Remember, in Islam, collateral damage is not allowed.
Intentionally bombing a group of people, assuming that your target would be killed, as well as others and the others would be collateral damage, is completely disallowed in Islam.
Muhammad's peaceful Jihad was now about to come to fruition.
Under the terms of the Treaty of Hudaibiya he could embark on a journey that would take him back to the city of his birth, the city he had left nearly seven years ago as a refugee, penniless and in fear of his life.
He was returning as the head of an ever-expanding religious community, the most powerful leader in Arabia.
In February 629, Muhammad agreed with the Quraysh to be allowed back into Mecca in order to visit the Kaaba.
The Quraysh agreed to allow Muhammad and his followers into the Kaaba for three days.
And yet, during that time, it marked a change in people's perceptions towards Muhammad and his followers.
The people of Mecca saw the Muslims enter the Kaaba, and observed how well behaved they were, how sincere they were, and it was important because it showed that slowly but surely, the stranglehold of the Quraysh in Mecca was beginning to crumble.
A year later, the Quraysh broke the truce by attacking one of Muhammad's allies.
It was a fatal mistake.
In January 630, the Prophet gathered a massive army of 10,000 men and marched towards Mecca.
The Quraysh were powerless to resist and they fully expected Muhammad to storm into Mecca and exact a bloody revenge for the many years of persecution and war.
Their control of city was at an end.
But it was what he did next, in this, hour of ultimate victory, that left people stunned.
Muhammad declared that he forgave all his former enemies.
He then said that there was to be a general amnesty and he said that no-one was to be forced to convert to Islam.
Instead of revenge, Muhammad consciously chose reconciliation.
The conquest of Mecca is very important, because there was a wide-ranging amnesty given, and people were given options of accepting the faith, or going elsewhere, or whatever.
But, certainly, there was this notion that, OK, once Mecca is taken, and Mecca is considered to be the cultic centre now of this new faith, that certainly the first stage of the mission is complete, so there's no need for fighting.
For Muhammad, this was the moment he had been waiting for.
He had come back to Mecca not to kill the Quraysh, but to restore the Kaaba to its role as the sacred shrine to the one God.
According to Muslim tradition, when he and thousands of his followers entered the Kaaba they destroyed the many gods and effigies placed there.
He pardons the Meccans, but he doesn't just pardon them, he pardons them with kindness and he almost drowns their criticisms with gifts.
And there is that sort of wonderful instance of just the tribal sheiks, who had never really opposed and never listened to his message, all they wanted was cattle, more camels and more silver, and he gives it to them.
It seems to me that's the heart and the essence of the life of the Prophet.
The moment it was building to.
From what I understand and know of the personality of the Prophet, it is the most characteristic moment in his entire life.
He was not a vengeful man.
His message was not about vengeance, but about constructing a transformative, reformative process, building society by including everybody.
So, it seems to me that when he came back to Mecca, that's when I say, yes, that's the point from which we begin, that's the model we need to build on.
And then he goes home.
There is no attempt to impose what we'd call today an Islamic state.
So, we're not talking about doctrinal conformity, we're talking about ending this tribalism which sets people off against one another.
Although Mecca was now his, Muhammad chose not to move back to the city of his birth.
Instead he returned to his adopted home, Medina.
And with the Quraysh defeated, it wasn't long before the rest of Arabia joined his cause.
Muhammad's bloodless conquest of Mecca was clear proof that his movement was succeeding.
And, what's more, his message of justice and using peace and reconciliation as a means of delivering that message was beginning to attract huge numbers of converts.
In fact, tribes were beginning to convert wholesale.
By 631, the last pagan stronghold of Taif fell.
Now Muhammad was effectively the ruler of the whole of Muslim Arabia.
More than 20 years had passed since he had received his first revelation.
For over a decade, he and his followers had eked out a precarious existence.
Time after time, they had been on the verge of destruction, but they had managed to survive through a combination of Muhammad's spiritual, military and political leadership, and, finally, after a seemingly humiliating treaty, to triumph over their enemies.
Muhammad expressed and exemplified the qualities that we now see universally are characteristic of a good leader and a leader for good - enthusiasm, integrity... then the combination of toughness and demandingness and fairness is important in leaders universally,
and Muhammad had all those attributes very clearly.
I think warmth, humanity, kindness is important, too.
And, again, if you look at the traditions of the life of Muhammad, there are plenty of examples where he showed those humane qualities.
By the year 632, Muhammad had achieved almost all that he had set out to achieve.
He created a level of peace and security Arabia had rarely known.
He laid out the foundations and rules of Islam and he created the foundations of a new Muslim community.
But by this time, he was 60 years old and his health was beginning to fail.
In that year, he came to Mecca for the last time and he performed his first and only Hajj, The Pilgrimage, and he gave what would become known as the "farewell sermon".
Sitting here on a camel, on the Plains of Arafat, he spoke to a vast crowd with strategically placed announcers relaying his words.
It was a deeply emotional speech in which, in his own words,
Muhammad summarised what he felt he and his followers had achieved.
"O People!
Lend me an attentive ear,
"for I know not whether after this year I shall ever be amongst you again.
"Therefore, listen carefully to what I am saying and take these words
"to those who could not be present here today".
You see in the final sermon this heartfelt plea from the Prophet warning the Muslims about certain things, advising them about certain things.
You can see his worries for the future of the Muslims and these words are something that they should take note of, and they should hang onto, and they should be aware, because in here is a very, very important message for every Muslim.
"Do not therefore do injustice to yourselves.
"Remember one day you will meet Allah and answer your deeds.
"So beware - do not astray from the path of righteousness after I am gone".
Remember what God's earliest message was, to Abraham, to Adam, to Moses, to Jesus, etc., and remember that the only real reality, the ultimate reality, is the one true God,
and that God is the creator, sustainer and judge of the universe.
"All mankind is from Adam and Eve.
"An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab,
"nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab.
"Also, a white has no superiority over black,
"nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action".
He is saying all humans are one.
God has called you from the tribalism of paganism and it's pride in ancestors, but, remember, all men came from Adam and Adam came from dust.
And then he quotes these words from the Qur'an which really speak to our time.
"O, people", God says to humanity,
"we have formed you from a male and a female and have formed you
"into tribes and nations so that you may get to know one another,
"not so that you may fight, or oppress, or occupy, or convert or terrorise,
"but so that you may get to know one another."
"All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others,
"and those to others again, and may the last ones understand my words better
"than those who listen to me directly.
"Be my witness, O Allah, that I have conveyed your message to your people".
And he asks them, "O, people, O, Muslims, have I fulfilled my mandate to you?"
And they cry, "Na'am!",
"yes", and it rings around.
And he asks them three times, have I, and each time they reply, "Na'am!"
And I think it's a most moving moment.
Well, that's the summation of his life, so he emphasises all the principles that he has been teaching for the last 23 years.
He says, for example, there is no difference between Arab and non-Arab, look after your family, so it's kind of summation of his life.
If you did nothing else but simply read the last sermon, you will get the essence of the life of Muhammad.
The Prophet's final sermon sets the agenda for modern, contemporary Muslim society.
It shows were we've failed, and it shows were we have to try to get to.
It sums up the transformative mission that was the life of the Prophet.
After his farewell pilgrimage,
Muhammad returned to his small house in Medina, exhausted.
He'd begun to have headaches and fainting fits.
He tried to attend public prayers in the mosque, but was more and more confined to his bed, where Aisha nursed him.
One day he appeared to get better and the news spread like wildfire around the oasis.
But it was only a brief reprieve.
On 8th June, 632, Muhammad died in the house of his wife Aisha.
The news stunned his followers.
Some refused to accept the truth.
Panic began to take hold.
How could the Messenger of God be dead?
His closest companion, Abu Bakr, calmed their fears, reminding them that Muhammad had never claimed to be anything other than a mere mortal and that only God is to be worshipped, not Muhammad.
He was buried here next to his mosque, his face turned towards Mecca, a practice still common today among Muslims.
Within 100 years, Muhammad's message had spread across the world, as far as India and China in the east, and as far North Africa,
Spain and France in the west.
But, in many ways, his struggle for a peaceful Jihad was already in tatters.
Within just a generation of Muhammad's death, his closest companions and family were already squabbling, breaking out into open and bloody warfare that led to the deep schism that still exists within the Muslim world today between Sunni and Shia.
But today, Muhammad's message seems under threat like never before.
Many Muslims feel humiliated and condemned by the sheer power of Western culture and military might, whilst many in the west see Islam as the religion of some of the most oppressive states on Earth, a violent, intolerant faith.
But the question is, how much of this can be blamed on Muhammad himself?
Muhammad left the world with three things - his faith in God, the example of his own life and, above all else, the Qur'an itself.
Now, people will always choose and highlight those aspects of his life they want to support their own arguments whilst ignoring the rest.
But if we examine his life in total, we find that he left Arabia a better place than he found it.
When faced with persecution, he chose to suffer rather than to retaliate.
Although he fought many military battles, he turned his back on war when he could.
His ultimate victory came through peace, not through conflict.
And with that victory, he chose the path of reconciliation, rather than revenge.
And, finally, in his farewell sermon, Muhammad left us with the most important lesson of all, that we are all equal, Arab and non-Arab, Muslim and non-Muslim.
A universal message that is as relevant today as it was in 7th-century Arabia, and it seems to me this is the true legacy of the life of Muhammad.

1,400 years ago, a man born here in Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, changed the course of world history.
If you had to rate the top people in the history of the world as leaders, the name of Muhammad would be in the top three.
Here we have a man who began a mission.
He gave light to the world.
For one and a half billion Muslims, he is the last and greatest of that long line of prophets who have brought the word of God to humanity.
He was not just a spiritual genius, but he also had political gifts of a very high order.
He laid the foundations for a religion, Islam, that after his death developed a culture and civilization that spread around the world and inspired some of the most beautiful architecture.
But today, Islam is at the very heart of the conflict that defines our world, and Muhammad's name is associated with some of the most appalling acts of terrorism the world has ever seen.
Osama Bin Laden and others who have committed acts of Jihad terrorism
Osama Bin Laden and others who have committed acts of Jihad terrorism consistently invoke the Qur'an and Muhammad's example to justify what they are doing.
Obedience to one true God, Allah, and follow in the footsteps of the final prophet and messenger, Muhammad.
Outside the Islamic world, almost nothing is known about Muhammad, whereas for Muslims, he is the ultimate role model, and his life is known in every detail.
So, who was he?
What was his message?
And why are so many people, Muslims and non-Muslims, divided over his legacy?
In this groundbreaking series,
I will explore the many complexities of his life story, about the revelations he is said to have received from God, about his many wives, about his relations with the Jews of Arabia, about his use of war and peace,
and about the laws that he enacted when he set up his own state.
I want to examine his life and times and understand how they still affect today's world, and whether they are a force for good or evil.
I want to uncover the real Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, peace be upon him.
Muhammad was born in Mecca in the year 570, into the ruling tribe of the city, the Quraysh.
According to Muslim tradition, at the age of 40,
Muhammad received a revelation from God, the first of many that would later become the Qur'an, the sacred text of Islam.
He preached a new message that Allah was the one God, that he, Muhammad, was his messenger, and that all human beings would account for their behaviour on the Day of Judgement.
He slowly built up a small band of followers, from his family, friends and the marginalised sections of Meccan society.
But it was not a message that was always welcome.
Right from the start, Muhammad's new message brought him into conflict with the rulers of Mecca - his own tribe, the Quraysh, who saw him as a direct threat to their control of the city.
By the time of Muhammad's birth, the Kaaba had long been a shrine drawing people to the town of Mecca, the centre of pagan cults for the people of Arabia.
For 13 years, Muhammad and his small band of followers endured increasingly brutal persecution at the hands of the Quraysh, until they were forced to leave Mecca and begin a new life in the city of Medina.
Muhammad's new-found power at the head of Medina's Jewish and pagan tribes threatened the Quraysh's status as Arabia's pre-eminent tribe.
Several times, they tried to crush Muhammad and his followers by force.
In the final battle, it's alleged that one of Medina's Jewish tribes switched allegiances, and in retaliation, all the Jewish men of that tribe were massacred on charge of treason.
It was one of the most controversial incidents in Muhammad's life.
With the ending of the siege of Medina,
Muhammad had overcome the most powerful Arab army ever assembled against them and, once again, he had humiliated his Quraysh opponents.
He had seen off all local opposition to his rule and, what's more, he'd ensured the survival of the Muslim community here in Medina.
He was by now arguably the most powerful man in all of Arabia.
The revelations Muhammad received would go on to form the Muslim holy book, The Qur'an.
They came to him throughout his life, and every time they occurred, it was a terrifying and exhausting experience.
He frequently had to struggle to make sense of them.
Some came as words, others as visions that needed intense concentration to understand their meaning.
He would always say that "never once did I receive a revelation
"without feeling that my soul had been torn from my body."
He'd go pale, and he'd sweat, even on a cold day.
It's an effort to speak the word of God.
For me, the Prophet has got that sort of terrifying, brief access to divine power, and he is using that consciousness that sort of flooded into his body, and creating the words.
Muhammad is born into an age where it is taken for granted that the veil which obscures the dimension of the heavenly, the dimension of the angelic, can be penetrated by men of peculiar vision or holiness, and this is taken for granted
by Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian holy men.
And it's why people are able to accept his assurance that he is receiving revelations from God.
It is why they are able to accept it.
This kind of spiritual experience is not normally associated with Islam.
One Muslim group, though, the Sufis, claim to try to replicate Muhammad's mystical experience of God through intense prayer, the chanting of God's name and singing verses from the Qur'an.
TRANSLATION:
When Prophet Muhammad was saying his prayers, while he was mediating and communicating with God, he used to hear the divine instructions and then act.
That's why in Sufism, and in Islam, we also try to come close to God.
Through our rituals, we try and be one with Him.
Prophet Muhammad is an example of this.
Whatever he did during his prayers or during his daily life is there for us to take example.
The Sufis have developed their own elaborate rituals and techniques and, here in Turkey, they even dance.
Although there is no evidence to suggest that Muhammad followed these rituals, the Sufis see him as an inspiration for their spiritual experience.
The Prophet as a perfect human is very much a part of both theological and Sufi traditions in Islam.
His perfection lies in the fact that it is only through him that one can know God.
At the centre of the ceremony is the practice of zikr, or the repeated lyrical chanting of God's name, to bring people closer to God.
CHANTING MALE VOICE SINGS
The chanting is followed by a particularly Turkish Sufi practice to induce a trance-like condition through dance.
Every religion generates its own diversity of spiritual practices.
Islam is no exception.
We have a number of different spiritual traditions, of which Sufism is but one.
Now, the Prophet prayed, he meditated, he contemplated, but he also said, "Pray, but tie your camel".
That means praying itself is not good enough.
You have to do good.
You have to create a healthy, better society at the same time.
Anybody who follows this spiritual tradition and does good, and the emphasis on doing good is very, very important, is, in fact, following the way of Muhammad.
But Muhammad's spiritual experiences were firmly rooted in the practical necessities of life.
He was not someone who retired from the world, but worked continually to reform Arabian society.
Instead of simply waiting for paradise at the end of the world,
Muhammad tried to create his own ideal society in his own lifetime.
By 627AD Muhammad had become a powerful ruler in Medina, but by all accounts, in his personal habits and way of life, he remained modest.
He continued to live next to his small mosque that served both as a place of worship and a centre for his work.
Everyone was free to enter and speak with him
- Jews, Christians, non-believers, even slaves.
Reading the accounts, it is clear he is a very charismatic figure.
He is a person that numerous people came to for advice.
Constantly came for advice.
But it was not just that he was dispensing sage advice, he was always listening to people.
He comes out as a very humane and warm person.
I think Muhammad does come across in many different contexts as being quite gentle, quite reluctant to find fault.
He seemed a very fair individual.
Muslim sources talk of his simple taste in clothes and his dislike of gold or silk or other luxuries.
He did not care for possessions and gave much away in charity or as gifts.
I haven't personally detected any sign that Muhammad was guided by power.
I think his integrity remained intact.
He was scrupulous over any corruption or financial issues.
I think he stood out as a kind of exemplary human being who could combine that moral vision with the requirements of being a leader of a growing organization.
He is a searcher.
A searcher for truth and understanding throughout his life, and he's a man who used the magic of his own language.
He was a genius of the Arab people, infused it with something worldwide, to make something that humankind could understand.
Muhammad received revelations throughout his life, but between Mecca and Medina their content changed significantly.
Whereas in Mecca the revelations dealt with inward principles of spirituality and faith, here in Medina the revelations would be far more practical.
They provided a blueprint for how one should live life on a day-to-day basis as a Muslim, from the social to the political - a blueprint that many Muslims try to follow today.
Whilst in Mecca, he is very much a religious preacher.
He talks much more about issues such as the end of time.
You know, it's about morality, about justice and these kinds of things.
Once he moves to Medina, he is the functioning leader of a community.
He therefore has to get much more involved in the day-to-day running of a community, how people interact with each other, how people manage inheritance, how people greet each other, even.
The revelations could be quite explicit - all Muslims should pay a tax to support the sick and needy.
Or they could be general guidelines about how to treat others to promote justice and human dignity.
Muhammad used these principles in deciding matters brought to him as the ruler of Medina.
Over time, a moral code was revealed to Muhammad, based on ideas of social justice for all.
In the Qur'an, it was called Sharia or 'the way to know God'.
We have three verses where the concept is revealed in one way or another, in one form or another.
And, in fact, what was understood by the Prophet and his companions is that what they were trying to implement was, in fact, this way towards God.
So, this is why we have a problem of defining the word because the scholars afterward defined Sharia as God's law, but because they were jurists, so for them Sharia is all about law.
But what he was doing is just promoting, you know, brotherhood, justice, equality, freedom.
This is Sharia, in fact.
What is known today as Sharia law, the sacred law of Islam, is very different.
It only came into existence two centuries after Muhammad's death, when Muslim legal experts devised a legal code to help run the ever-expanding Islamic Empire.
They used a mixture of Qur'anic teachings and examples from Muhammad's life.
Many Muslims now regard that version of Sharia as the unalterable law of God.
The underlying principles of Islamic law appear in the Qur'an, and there are detailed regulations relating to very specific areas, such as inheritance, which you do find in the Qur'an.
But the Sharia itself is a human edifice constructed over time.
It's man's attempt to understand God's will and implement it.
But there are divergent views within the Sharia, there are contradictory rulings, and so it is certainly not a code sent down directly from God.
It's something much more flexible and fluid, and adaptive to circumstance.
In Medina, Muhammad made many radical changes to the customs of his tribal past.
He abolished the brutal tradition of blood feuds.
Women acquired a share in inheritance and secured rights to own property.
But the Qur'an also ordered more traditional penalties, such as the amputation of limbs for stealing, although there is no evidence that Muhammad ever did this.
Many of these punishments still form part of Sharia law today.
There was the practice of female infanticide in 7th-century Arabia.
So, if you had a daughter and didn't want to take care of her for 13 or 15 years, until someone's going to marry her, you toss her out into the desert and she would die.
Muhammad put an end to that.
Muhammad put an emphasis on helping orphans and widows.
We would look at that and say, great, that's a great teaching.
But, certainly, we find many teachings that we would consider barbaric by today's standards.
Stoning of adulterers and adulteresses, chopping off body parts of those who steal things.
These are certain things I would regard as backwards.
Today, because we are facing the West, because we are having a very narrow understanding, we come with something that Sharia is, how we are going to implement very narrow understanding of what a marriage is, of what punishments are,
and I think that this is not the way.
And this is why I am saying today if I am speaking about Sharia,
I live in the West and in the West, we have laws where you and me, we are equal before law.
This is my Sharia.
This is where we have to come with a better, a deeper understanding of the very essence of Sharia.
Some Muslim states, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, base their entire legal system on Sharia law, with punishments that many regard as medieval in their brutality.
So, calls by Muslim extremists to introduce Sharia law in Europe and in Britain have led to street protests and the rise of political parties campaigning against what they see as the spread of Islamic influence.
This is the problem - that in the 21st century, we still have nations who are beheading people, who are cutting the limbs off people, cutting the hands and feet.
There are women today being stoned to death by the government for sexual violations, not for murder.
It's not for a crime of taking someone else's life.
It's an inhumane way of killing.
All these people who are stoning the people and are just starting with punishments say this is Sharia.
I say no, that's not Sharia.
This is the way you are instrumentalising religion for your own sake.
I have one question.
How have you been elected?
Are you elected?
Are you representing the people?
Let me start with the first question because you have no legitimacy, no way for you to implement this in the name of Islam, if you are not legitimate.
Many of the people who do, and start with this, are not really elected, and are not chosen by the people, so their own status, it's important.
And then there is a second question, what about social justice?
What about equal rights?
What about education?
Are you going to punish people without educating them?
Is this Islam?
No.
Islam is starting with education.
And as for the punishment, it's another story.
Don't start with punishment, start with dignity and rights.
Not with punishment, because punishment is the way you instrumentalise religion just to make yourself be legitimate while you are not.
Like all law, Sharia law, at least in theory, is supposed to be a changing, evolving institution, but what we have under the rubric of Sharia law today is actually frozen in history.
It is the interpretations of jurists undertaken during the 8th and 9th century.
That is what we call Sharia law.
That's why wherever Sharia law is implemented it recreates the conditions of the 8th and 9th century.
What the Muslims need to do is to reformulate Sharia law, and this reformulation has to be continuous and constant.
Because the word Sharia itself means "the way to the watering hole".
Why do you go to the watering hole?
To drink water.
It is something that we need to drink all the time.
That means it has to be refreshed, rethought and reformulated from epoch to epoch.
It was now 627 AD.
Muhammad had a secure power base in Medina.
Although he had frustrated all the efforts of his enemies, the Quraysh, to destroy him, they were still powerful and in control of Mecca.
If Muhammad was to succeed in bringing his message to all the people of Arabia, he had to find a solution to break this stalemate.
One of the key lessons from the battles for Muhammad was that he was going to find it very difficult to overcome the Meccans militarily.
He had to try to undermine them politically.
What he needed was to strike alliances with other tribes across Arabia.
And one of the key ways of doing this was through marriage.
For Muhammad's critics, his polygamous marriages have always been a problem.
But at that time in Arabia, polygamy was the norm, and it wasn't until after the death of his first wife that Muhammad had several wives at the same time.
Some accounts say nine, others 11 or 13.
Some were widows.
Some were women captured after battles who, by marrying him, were granted their freedom.
One was even a Christian Coptic slave presented to him by the Byzantine ruler of Egypt.
But his most controversial marriage was to the daughter of his closest companion, a young girl called Aisha.
According to some sources,
Aisha is supposed to have been betrothed at age six or seven, then formally married at nine.
Other accounts make her older, nearly 16 or 17.
It's this lack of clarity that has left Muhammad open to serious condemnation from many critics.
If you are a 53-year-old man, and you take a nine-year-old girl into your bed and consummate the marriage, it is not all right.
Not only from the standpoint of 21st-century morality of the Western world, but of, what one might say, natural morality of most societies, most of the time.
My position on this is that she was older.
She was between 16 and 18, and not six and nine.
So these are scholars of today, but not today, in fact last century, trying to get a sense of that might be.
We are repeating this, but this is not really true, it is not something which is in the Qur'an, is in the prophetic tradition, and we have to check about this, and I would say that age here is problematic in itself.
Muhammad's marriage to Aisha lasted till his death.
And she later became a prominent political leader in her own right.
Muslim historians claim that it was her differences with Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law Ali that eventually led to the great schism in Islam between the Sunni and the Shia sects.
The real point in this, and that is lost in all this argument, is who was Aisha - what did she become?
She grew up in the Prophet's household to become a really feisty, independent, intelligent, politically aware woman.
And she is a foundation of our understanding of the Prophet's life.
Without Aisha, half of what we know of the Prophet disappears.
A series of further revelations defined Islamic marriage.
They also provided Muhammad's critics with more ammunition, as they said that while Muhammad was allowed to keep all his wives, in future, Muslim men would only be allowed a maximum of four wives, as long as they could support them and treat them all equally.
We have to understand the Prophet Muhammad in the context of his time.
Pagan Arabia is a place where there is unlimited polygamy, that is the normal practice.
Islam comes, and limits that polygamy.
For Muslims, it is limited to four wives.
The Prophet is allowed, and the Prophet is previously married up to nine wives.
He is also prohibited from adding any more to that number, but those wives that he is married to, he is allowed to keep.
And there is a simple reason for that - the importance of building tribal alliances.
This is very, very important.
The Prophet is not only a prophet, he is a leader of his people and building those alliances is hugely important.
Now, the justification for Muhammad having more wives is sura 33:50, which gave Muhammad, and only Muhammad, permission to marry as many women as he wanted to marry, and we have to be somewhat sceptical.
So many people have claimed to be prophets, when we look at a prophet and his revelations give him more sexual partners than anyone else is allowed to have, I say we have some reason for suspicion here.
It would be entirely mistaken to imagine the Prophet basking decadently in a garden of earthly delights.
These are political marriages.
He marries Aisha because he wants to bind himself more closely with their fathers.
He's creating a new community, not based on tribe or blood, but somehow, this helps to make the transition easier, if you make a marriage link.
We know from Muslim sources that some of Muhammad's marriages even caused him problems during his own lifetime.
For example, when he married the divorced wife of his adopted son, his enemies spread rumours that it was an incestuous relationship in an attempt to divide the Muslim community.
His marriage to his former daughter in law, Zaynab bint Jahsh, when he married her, it's clear that there were protests from the community and people thought that this was a shocking, scandalising kind of thing for him to have done.
According to the sources, Muhammad faced another marital crisis when Aisha went missing during a journey.
She was eventually found and brought back to Medina by a man who had known her before her marriage to Muhammad.
Again, his enemies spread rumours that something scandalous must have happened between them.
According to Muslim tradition,
Muhammad himself was at first unsure who to believe, but, eventually, after a new revelation from God, he accepted Aisha's protestations of innocence.
At that time in Arabia, adulterers were traditionally stoned to death.
This new revelation defined how any future allegations of adultery should be dealt with, and, surprisingly, in complete contrast to the extreme views held by groups like the Taliban.
The punishment of stoning to death was borrowed from Christianity and Judaism.
From the Old Testament, of course, as we know.
In the Qur'an, punishment for having sex outside marriage is lashing 100 times on your backside.
Only if it can be proven that four people have seen the act of penetration, which is very difficult to prove.
Muhammad's wives lived with him in specially built rooms adjoining the courtyard of his mosque in Medina.
It was a very busy public place, and privacy was hard to find.
With the continual attempts of Muhammad's enemies to create division, the potential for future scandal was always there, so something had to be done.
One day Muhammad received a new revelation that instructed his wives to cover themselves to maintain their modesty.
This act of veiling or covering has had a profound effect on Muslim women and, also, how the outside world views Islam's attitudes to women in general.
There are injunctions about the Prophet's wives wearing some kind of covering.
It's not exactly clear what that covering is, but it's to distinguish them.
And this is all part and parcel of the difficult divisions in Medina, because Muhammad's enemies in Medina were using his wives to discredit him and so some kind of distinction needed to be made, but veiling was not for all women.
Today, the veil is seen by Islam's critics as symbolic of its attitude to women in general and its desire to oppress them.
But the more universal veiling of women did not become an Islamic custom until more than 100 years after Muhammad's death.
As far as the religion is concerned, there is a requirement of modesty for both men and women, but how you fulfil that requirement is open to debate.
I don't feel I am compromising myself as a Muslim by not wearing the hijab, and I certainly don't not wear it, because I am trying to say that I am not a serious Muslim.
You can't judge the seriousness of someone's faith and belief by what they wear.
Over the last 20 years, in Britain as in many Western countries, the veil has become a form of identity for many Muslim women.
Some just cover their hair, others their entire face.
It is a controversial issue, with some European countries now banning women from using the veil.
Fatima Barkatullah is a writer on Islamic women.
Fatima, are you wearing the veil because you are obliged to because of your family, or do you do it out of free will?
For me it is absolutely 100% free will.
It's very much about a spiritual journey and about wanting to be the best I can be, in God's eyes.
When I'm getting ready in the morning to go out,
I will just cover what I would normally be wearing, you know, whether it's jeans or whatever I am wearing, with something like this.
Which is a gown, essentially, isn't it?
Yes.
It's an outer garment.
People call it the abaya or the jilbab.
And then I wear this, which is a khimar, or a scarf.
And then I wear this small face veil.
This is very much my public face, if you like.
But why do you choose to wear the full face covering as opposed to this, the khimar, the scarf, which you see a lot of other Muslim women wearing, as well?
I believe that the more modest I can be, the more of a virtue it is.
So, essentially, I'm doing it to please God.
Where do you think this comes from?
Is it in the Qur'an?
Is it in the...
Yes, you'll find it in the Qur'an.
The verse in Surat Ahzab clearly says, "O Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters
"and the women of the believers," meaning the Muslim women, when they go out of their homes they should wear their outer garments, and the word in Arabic is jalabeeb, which has two orthodox interpretations.
That's the point.
This is all an interpretation.
There isn't anywhere in the Qur'an which says it is a rule for Muslim women that they must wear a veil.
It's in the interpretation.
As far as the face is concerned, there is some difference of opinion.
The one verse that specifically does deal with clothing actually says cover your nakedness, not shroud yourself in a black bag.
Now, Muslim women have interpreted it,
Muslim men have interpolated practices from other societies into the interpretation of the religion, and identity politics has a great deal to do with it.
But I say women should be free to choose, but there is no compulsion, and there is no requirement for them to veil themselves.
Despite the best efforts of his enemies to discredit him through his marriages,
Muhammad had used them to confirm and widen his power base in Arabia.
He could now turn his attention again to Mecca.
In early 628 AD, he told his followers that they were going to set out to perform the annual Hajj rites at the Kaaba in Mecca.
For Muhammad and his followers, the Kaaba had become central to their worship, the place to which they turned in prayer.
They believed it had been originally built by the Prophet Abraham, and regarded it as the ultimate symbol of their faith, the unity of the one God, Allah.
But access to the Kaaba was controlled by Muhammad's enemies, the Quraysh, the rulers of Mecca.
It contained shrines to the hundreds of gods worshipped by all the tribes in Arabia.
Muhammad was now determined to challenge their control of this sacred shrine.
The Prophet announces that he is going to make the Hajj.
It must have been astonishing because on the Hajj you are not allowed to carry weapons.
He was going unarmed into the enemy territory.
It's when, again, you touch the magic of Muhammad as a man.
He fought wars and now he just said, right, we're off to pray to God.
Muhammad and the convoy of followers were forced to stop here at Hudaibiya, which is about eight miles outside of the Holy City, because the Quraysh had reacted with characteristic aggression and they had sent a cavalry in order to stop the convoy.
And so began a series of frenetic negotiations with emissaries going between Muhammad and the Quraysh.
They eventually arrived at an agreement, but the so-called Treaty of Hudaibiya, signed at a spot marked by the mosque just behind me, looked like the most humiliating of compromises for Muhammad.
The Quraysh insisted that Muhammad and his followers return to Medina without performing the Hajj rites.
They also insisted that all raids on Meccan caravans by the Muslim forces under Muhammad's command should stop.
In return, they would allow Muhammad and his followers to return to Mecca as pilgrims to perform the Hajj, but only in the following year.
And when it came to signing the documents which describes Muhammad as "the Messenger of God", the Quraysh emissary objected, saying that to them he was only "Muhammad, the son of Abdullah".
For Muhammad's followers, this was an unbearable insult.
According to Muslim tradition, when Muhammad's young cousin Ali, who was doing the writing, heard this he refused to strike out the words "the Messenger of God".
Muhammad says, "Give me the pen" - point out the words "Messenger of God", and he strikes it out himself.
I see it as a striking out of ego there, not standing on your rights.
The Qur'an says that if the enemy asks for peace you must lay down your arms immediately and accept any terms, however disadvantageous.
For Muhammad's followers, the terms of this treaty, and the treatment of Muhammad, were completely humiliating.
It was only Muhammad's adamant attitude that kept them from mutiny.
What Muhammad was trying to do was totally unheard of in 7th-century Arabia.
In a society of honour, traditionally, blood feuds ruled the day.
But after years of bloody but inconclusive conflict, Muhammad now wanted to defeat his enemies not through war, but by peace.
By signing a truce with the Quraysh, he had not only gained access to the Kaaba, albeit at a later date, but also extracted from them the crucial acknowledgement that he and they were now equals.
In a sense, the Hudaibiya does represent a minimal option, which is,
OK, we can't get what we want now, but we can get it in the future, if we make this agreement.
And a truce in which people were not fighting was always preferable to war.
This is, again, something which is Qur'anically given, that, you know, peace is better than war.
It's repeated again and again.
So, it very much fits within that particular type of principle.
As he and his followers were returning to Medina,
Muhammad received a new revelation, confirming that the Treaty of Hudaibiya was a not a humiliating defeat.
He said, "I've just had a revelation.
This was a manifest victory, says God.
"It may have looked like a defeat, but it was a manifest victory."
The Quraysh were filled with all the violence of the old tribal spirit.
They were filled with contempt and pride.
It was the Muslims, the spirit of peace that filled their hearts.
Sometimes this is forgotten.
We hear all about Muhammad's wars, but we forget this extraordinary, non-violent offensive.
After Hudaibiya, the tide had turned in his favour with a campaign of non-violence.
A primary vehicle that Muhammad did use was diplomacy at the time.
He went out, visited the tribes, engaged with major religious leaders, attempted to form pacts, created, if you look at the community at Medina, created a space for other faiths and other people.
But when faced with resistance or aggression, did exactly what the standards of the time would have legitimated.
And I think that that is clearly there.
You do not see the Prophet consistently calling for wholesale killing of all those who disagreed with him.
The Treaty of Hudaibiya marks a turning point in Muhammad's attempts to spread his message throughout Arabia.
But it also shows that he was prepared to suffer the utmost humiliation from his worst enemies in pursuit of peace.
And yet in today's world, the most commonly held views of Muhammad is that he is the enemy of peace, and that Islam is the religion of Jihad, commonly taken to mean "Holy War".
Thousands have been killed all over the world by groups that are now called Jihadi, a term never used in Muhammad's time.
And yet, these groups all claim the Qur'an and Muhammad himself as inspiration and justification for their actions.
It is very clear, brothers and sisters, that the path of Jihad and the desire for martyrdom was deeply embedded in the Holy Prophet and their beloved companions.
Most so called Jihadis usually refer to a verse in the Qur'an, now known as the Sword Verse, as justification for their violent acts.
If you come back to the Qur'an, you have these verses, no one can deny that there are verses very, very much dealing with war and violence.
Now, as we have to deal with the Qur'an, it's an eternal book dealing with history.
These verses were revealed in a very specific period of time when the Muslims were under oppression and trying to resist and just to survive.
So, we have to contextualise this.
The mainstream classical tradition, in the Shia and the Sunni tradition, are saying you can't use these verses just to promote war and to kill innocent people, this is wrong.
The interpretation of individual Qur'anic verses goes to the heart of this controversy, but most scholars now agree that the term Jihad does not mean Holy War.
Its real meaning is completely different.
The concept of Jihad emerges out of the Holy Qur'an, out of the revelation that the Prophet receives.
And there are about 35 examples in the Qur'an of the word "jihad", or the term basically being used, and often in the case of striving.
Now striving can be all sorts of things.
It can be striving against the baseness of oneself.
It can be a seeking to overcome evil and being good.
It can be striving in the sense of fighting.
But Jihad is always distinguished from fighting, and a different terminology is used for the word "fighting".
In all the battles that Muhammad fought, the rules of engagement were always carefully delineated within the context of his time and what was generally acceptable.
But there are no recorded instances of deliberate attacks on civilian populations.
One of the points about Jihad in the early Islamic tradition, both in the Prophet's lifetime and afterwards, is that it's is a gradual evolution of an idea towards something like a just war.
And the just war is a constraint on the army, does not attack or massacre the civilians, doesn't kill women or children, doesn't kill priests of other religions incidentally, and so on.
And this draws on the practice in the lifetime of the Prophet.
These rules of engagement appear to have been forgotten by today's Muslim extremists.
Suicide bombers kill people not only in Western cities, but also in mosques and other places of worship in the Muslim world itself.
In Britain today, no Muslim activist or group will openly defy the law by accepting or agreeing to the use of violence.
But over the last 10 years, more than 200 Muslims have been convicted of terrorist-related offences.
In 2008, Abdul Muhid was convicted and jailed for two years for terrorist funding.
Mizanur Rahman was charged for soliciting murder and jailed for four years in 2006.
Both have now served their sentences, but still have strong views about the role of Jihad in today's world.
Has the modern interpretation of Jihad changed in any way?
Because, for most people today, Jihad means just one thing doesn't it, it means fighting and the physical struggle?
The scholars of Islam in the past, they all agreed that Jihad means fighting against the non-Muslims, yes, but not just for the sake of forcing them to be Muslim, but to make the word of Allah
the highest by removing obstacles from the implementation of the Sharia and for the call to Islam to spread across the world.
From your interpretation of the Prophet's life, is it permittable at any time in Jihad to attack non-combatants?
If I just cut straight to the point, the argument of Islamic terrorists is this, if you choose a government that represents you and they decide to bomb a country or kill people, then you have blood on your hands.
It's like hiring, for example, a murderer.
If I pay a murderer to go and kill someone it's not just the murderer who is blameworthy.
I share that blame.
So, if you say by non-combatants, these people voted for a government that is carrying out crimes, then they share the blame.
And, obviously in the eyes of the Islamic terrorists, they are blameworthy.
These ideas are abhorrent to Muslims and non-Muslims, and would have been unrecognisable to Muhammad.
For him, the concept of Jihad was not just simply about killing and war, but it was about striving to improve yourself in the eyes of God.
There is the concept of just war in Islam, and Muhammad himself fought many battles, but for him, there was no justification of the killing of innocent people.
The Qur'an verses that talk about fighting and defending yourself don't legitimize killing yourself deliberately and killing others in that process.
Remember, in Islam, collateral damage is not allowed.
Intentionally bombing a group of people, assuming that your target would be killed, as well as others and the others would be collateral damage, is completely disallowed in Islam.
Muhammad's peaceful Jihad was now about to come to fruition.
Under the terms of the Treaty of Hudaibiya he could embark on a journey that would take him back to the city of his birth, the city he had left nearly seven years ago as a refugee, penniless and in fear of his life.
He was returning as the head of an ever-expanding religious community, the most powerful leader in Arabia.
In February 629, Muhammad agreed with the Quraysh to be allowed back into Mecca in order to visit the Kaaba.
The Quraysh agreed to allow Muhammad and his followers into the Kaaba for three days.
And yet, during that time, it marked a change in people's perceptions towards Muhammad and his followers.
The people of Mecca saw the Muslims enter the Kaaba, and observed how well behaved they were, how sincere they were, and it was important because it showed that slowly but surely, the stranglehold of the Quraysh in Mecca was beginning to crumble.
A year later, the Quraysh broke the truce by attacking one of Muhammad's allies.
It was a fatal mistake.
In January 630, the Prophet gathered a massive army of 10,000 men and marched towards Mecca.
The Quraysh were powerless to resist and they fully expected Muhammad to storm into Mecca and exact a bloody revenge for the many years of persecution and war.
Their control of city was at an end.
But it was what he did next, in this, hour of ultimate victory, that left people stunned.
Muhammad declared that he forgave all his former enemies.
He then said that there was to be a general amnesty and he said that no-one was to be forced to convert to Islam.
Instead of revenge, Muhammad consciously chose reconciliation.
The conquest of Mecca is very important, because there was a wide-ranging amnesty given, and people were given options of accepting the faith, or going elsewhere, or whatever.
But, certainly, there was this notion that, OK, once Mecca is taken, and Mecca is considered to be the cultic centre now of this new faith, that certainly the first stage of the mission is complete, so there's no need for fighting.
For Muhammad, this was the moment he had been waiting for.
He had come back to Mecca not to kill the Quraysh, but to restore the Kaaba to its role as the sacred shrine to the one God.
According to Muslim tradition, when he and thousands of his followers entered the Kaaba they destroyed the many gods and effigies placed there.
He pardons the Meccans, but he doesn't just pardon them, he pardons them with kindness and he almost drowns their criticisms with gifts.
And there is that sort of wonderful instance of just the tribal sheiks, who had never really opposed and never listened to his message, all they wanted was cattle, more camels and more silver, and he gives it to them.
It seems to me that's the heart and the essence of the life of the Prophet.
The moment it was building to.
From what I understand and know of the personality of the Prophet, it is the most characteristic moment in his entire life.
He was not a vengeful man.
His message was not about vengeance, but about constructing a transformative, reformative process, building society by including everybody.
So, it seems to me that when he came back to Mecca, that's when I say, yes, that's the point from which we begin, that's the model we need to build on.
And then he goes home.
There is no attempt to impose what we'd call today an Islamic state.
So, we're not talking about doctrinal conformity, we're talking about ending this tribalism which sets people off against one another.
Although Mecca was now his, Muhammad chose not to move back to the city of his birth.
Instead he returned to his adopted home, Medina.
And with the Quraysh defeated, it wasn't long before the rest of Arabia joined his cause.
Muhammad's bloodless conquest of Mecca was clear proof that his movement was succeeding.
And, what's more, his message of justice and using peace and reconciliation as a means of delivering that message was beginning to attract huge numbers of converts.
In fact, tribes were beginning to convert wholesale.
By 631, the last pagan stronghold of Taif fell.
Now Muhammad was effectively the ruler of the whole of Muslim Arabia.
More than 20 years had passed since he had received his first revelation.
For over a decade, he and his followers had eked out a precarious existence.
Time after time, they had been on the verge of destruction, but they had managed to survive through a combination of Muhammad's spiritual, military and political leadership, and, finally, after a seemingly humiliating treaty, to triumph over their enemies.
Muhammad expressed and exemplified the qualities that we now see universally are characteristic of a good leader and a leader for good - enthusiasm, integrity... then the combination of toughness and demandingness and fairness is important in leaders universally,
and Muhammad had all those attributes very clearly.
I think warmth, humanity, kindness is important, too.
And, again, if you look at the traditions of the life of Muhammad, there are plenty of examples where he showed those humane qualities.
By the year 632, Muhammad had achieved almost all that he had set out to achieve.
He created a level of peace and security Arabia had rarely known.
He laid out the foundations and rules of Islam and he created the foundations of a new Muslim community.
But by this time, he was 60 years old and his health was beginning to fail.
In that year, he came to Mecca for the last time and he performed his first and only Hajj, The Pilgrimage, and he gave what would become known as the "farewell sermon".
Sitting here on a camel, on the Plains of Arafat, he spoke to a vast crowd with strategically placed announcers relaying his words.
It was a deeply emotional speech in which, in his own words,
Muhammad summarised what he felt he and his followers had achieved.
"O People!
Lend me an attentive ear,
"for I know not whether after this year I shall ever be amongst you again.
"Therefore, listen carefully to what I am saying and take these words
"to those who could not be present here today".
You see in the final sermon this heartfelt plea from the Prophet warning the Muslims about certain things, advising them about certain things.
You can see his worries for the future of the Muslims and these words are something that they should take note of, and they should hang onto, and they should be aware, because in here is a very, very important message for every Muslim.
"Do not therefore do injustice to yourselves.
"Remember one day you will meet Allah and answer your deeds.
"So beware - do not astray from the path of righteousness after I am gone".
Remember what God's earliest message was, to Abraham, to Adam, to Moses, to Jesus, etc., and remember that the only real reality, the ultimate reality, is the one true God,
and that God is the creator, sustainer and judge of the universe.
"All mankind is from Adam and Eve.
"An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab,
"nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab.
"Also, a white has no superiority over black,
"nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action".
He is saying all humans are one.
God has called you from the tribalism of paganism and it's pride in ancestors, but, remember, all men came from Adam and Adam came from dust.
And then he quotes these words from the Qur'an which really speak to our time.
"O, people", God says to humanity,
"we have formed you from a male and a female and have formed you
"into tribes and nations so that you may get to know one another,
"not so that you may fight, or oppress, or occupy, or convert or terrorise,
"but so that you may get to know one another."
"All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others,
"and those to others again, and may the last ones understand my words better
"than those who listen to me directly.
"Be my witness, O Allah, that I have conveyed your message to your people".
And he asks them, "O, people, O, Muslims, have I fulfilled my mandate to you?"
And they cry, "Na'am!",
"yes", and it rings around.
And he asks them three times, have I, and each time they reply, "Na'am!"
And I think it's a most moving moment.
Well, that's the summation of his life, so he emphasises all the principles that he has been teaching for the last 23 years.
He says, for example, there is no difference between Arab and non-Arab, look after your family, so it's kind of summation of his life.
If you did nothing else but simply read the last sermon, you will get the essence of the life of Muhammad.
The Prophet's final sermon sets the agenda for modern, contemporary Muslim society.
It shows were we've failed, and it shows were we have to try to get to.
It sums up the transformative mission that was the life of the Prophet.
After his farewell pilgrimage,
Muhammad returned to his small house in Medina, exhausted.
He'd begun to have headaches and fainting fits.
He tried to attend public prayers in the mosque, but was more and more confined to his bed, where Aisha nursed him.
One day he appeared to get better and the news spread like wildfire around the oasis.
But it was only a brief reprieve.
On 8th June, 632, Muhammad died in the house of his wife Aisha.
The news stunned his followers.
Some refused to accept the truth.
Panic began to take hold.
How could the Messenger of God be dead?
His closest companion, Abu Bakr, calmed their fears, reminding them that Muhammad had never claimed to be anything other than a mere mortal and that only God is to be worshipped, not Muhammad.
He was buried here next to his mosque, his face turned towards Mecca, a practice still common today among Muslims.
Within 100 years, Muhammad's message had spread across the world, as far as India and China in the east, and as far North Africa,
Spain and France in the west.
But, in many ways, his struggle for a peaceful Jihad was already in tatters.
Within just a generation of Muhammad's death, his closest companions and family were already squabbling, breaking out into open and bloody warfare that led to the deep schism that still exists within the Muslim world today between Sunni and Shia.
But today, Muhammad's message seems under threat like never before.
Many Muslims feel humiliated and condemned by the sheer power of Western culture and military might, whilst many in the west see Islam as the religion of some of the most oppressive states on Earth, a violent, intolerant faith.
But the question is, how much of this can be blamed on Muhammad himself?
Muhammad left the world with three things - his faith in God, the example of his own life and, above all else, the Qur'an itself.
Now, people will always choose and highlight those aspects of his life they want to support their own arguments whilst ignoring the rest.
But if we examine his life in total, we find that he left Arabia a better place than he found it.
When faced with persecution, he chose to suffer rather than to retaliate.
Although he fought many military battles, he turned his back on war when he could.
His ultimate victory came through peace, not through conflict.
And with that victory, he chose the path of reconciliation, rather than revenge.
And, finally, in his farewell sermon, Muhammad left us with the most important lesson of all, that we are all equal, Arab and non-Arab, Muslim and non-Muslim.
A universal message that is as relevant today as it was in 7th-century Arabia, and it seems to me this is the true legacy of the life of Muhammad.

Uh, it's none of my business, but I can see the pool hasn't been used much lately.
Uh, a friend's son used to come over and use it.
If I cut back to twice a month, you could probably save a few bucks.
Um...
Let me think about it?
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, I used to pay your cousin online.
Uh, yeah, I'm not really set up for that.
I'm not much of a computer guy.
Me neither.
All right, check it is.
Okay.
Oh, uh, y-you want a check now?

Manus:
The Northside strangler?
Between '05 and late 2008, he was linked with the abduction and murder of six women -- these two make eight.
Now eight.
I headed up the Chicago side of the task force with Detective Harper of the Illinois State Bureau for almost four years.
Until our unsub went dormant and our trail turned to ice.
A message from Sun 'n Lakes Timeshares was left on our suspect's phone three days ago.
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
What I found two days ago in Chicago is the first activity we've clocked in 2 1/2 years.
Okay, fine.
But what makes you -- or, rather, her -- think that the unsub is here?
Detective Harper seems to think that he's searching for a new hunting ground.
He's territorial -- six kills within the same 8 square miles, then stops -- imprisonment, maybe injury -- then kills again in the same zone with the same victimology and the same blacked-out eyes,
then bolts in the middle of the night to visit timeshares in Florida.
He's on the move, and my guess is he's gonna kill again soon.
She sounds pretty confident.
Yeah.
That's one word for it.
Okay, fine, but, uh, while she's here, she's your problem.
And that's another.
Thanks.
Thanks for your time.
Ah.
You must be Mr. and Mrs...
Uh, Longworth and Harper.
Detectives Longworth and Harper.
Oh.
I thought you were here for the promotion.
Maybe.
What are you offering?
Well, we have a fantastic offer.
By attending a one-day presentation, we are gifting a complimentary two days of tennis, golf, and fabulous food at our world-class facility.
Sounds good.
How many sales pitches do we have to sit through for that?
Well, they're not pitches, per se, but there are a series of guest meetings throughout the week.
Ah.
Now, did a Bob Wilson attend one of those "guest meetings"?
Maybe.
Uh, is there some trouble?
We believe he may have killed eight women.
A-a serial killer?
Yeah, who may have attended one of your presentations, so, uh, if we could loop back around to that question?
Yes.
We do have a Bob Wilson in our records.
And he was scheduled to attend two weeks ago, but he never showed up.
But he did attend this past weekend.
Can you describe him?
Uh, between the Sun 'n Lakes and, uh,
Citrus Estates locations, we have over 340 guests.
I notice a lot of your guests are wearing I.D. badges.
Can you give us a copy of Bob Wilson's?
We take I.D.s after lunch, and it looks like he left after the first session in the morning.
Didn't want his picture taken.
Any of your female guests not return after lunch?
All the women came back except a Margaret Palmer did not come back after the first day.
Meaning she sat through the presentation but didn't stick around for the cool free shit?
Do you have her picture?
You got an address for this Margaret Palmer?
She was just here on vacation, and she was staying at the Westin.
Fits the profile.
Man:
According to our records,
Margaret Palmer hasn't used her room card in two days.
When is she scheduled to check out?
She's booked through tomorrow.
I'll check the bedroom.
Thank you.
[ Beep ]
Margaret:
Who the fuck are you?
Oh.
Ms. Palmer?
Get out!
No, no, no, wait.
I'm Jim Longworth.
I'm FDLE.
Get out!
[ Grunting ] Watch it!
Watch it!
You're gonna...
Stun yourself.
I see you haven't lost your touch with the ladies.
If we'd dug a little deeper, we would have realized that other than a vague physical resemblance,
Margaret Palmer did not fit our victimology.
Yeah, she required the assistance of a walking cane.
He's never targeted the weak before.
Was there any forensic evidence that pulled it all together?
There was never any physical evidence, no DNA to link him to the victims.
Although there was ash from a cigarette found on every victim, so we assume our killer's a smoker.
Anything that linked the victims together?
Apart from Chicago and general physical similarities, nothing.
We have two school teachers, a speech therapist, a social worker...
A crossing guard, and three stay-at-home moms.
Hmm.
Not like any stay-at-home mom I've ever seen.
Oh, Crystal Benson was a stripper.
Worked a pole right in the middle of our kill zone.
Which begs the question -- was there any sexual assault?
No.
No sexual component.
Violence is sex for them.
It's at the heart of their urges.
Which is what we think is behind the weird blackening of the eyes thing.
Yeah, what's that about?
Sam:
Shame -- at who he is and what he's done.
So he can't look back at them.
Hmm.
3 1/2 years you guys lived in this guy's head -- that explains you.
But you?
[ Chuckles ]
You got lucky.
I did?
Awesome.
Yeah.
Margaret Palmer decided not to press charges.
Yeah, I wasn't even in the room, so...
Detective Harper, I like to asset share as much as the next lawman, but in case you haven't noticed, this is Florida, meaning we've got no shortage of deviants to track down.
So until or unless you can show me some evidence of your Northside strangler -- like, I don't know, a body --
I'm gonna need to take my bodies back.
I love her.
Seriously, she's awesome.
[ Horn honks ]
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, is this yours?
Will be in two years when I pay off the loan.
This is awesome.
Come on.

All right.
Well, look at you, all official.
So, how did you...
Oh, uh, a buddy of mine.
Him and his wife kind of got knocked up, so...
Kind of got knocked up?
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
So, money was tight, and they let me take over the payments.
That's industrious.
Yeah, well, lets me hit the ground running, you know, be my own boss.
Oh, um, I t-took some money out of our joint account, just for, like, the first payment and gas and stuff like that.
I hope that's okay.
Yeah, of course.
No, that's your money, too.
Promise I'll have it back in there by the end of the week.
Really, it's not a problem.
Hey, can we take it for a ride?
Absolutely.
Let's go.
Load up.
All right.
Come on, mom.
There's room for you.
I should, uh, start on the laundry, but you guys have fun.
You really want these women staring back at you again?
Or not staring back.
I can't tell you how many times I've done this, stand there, staring at his victims.
Agonizing over what we could have overlooked.
So much of those 3 1/2 years just haunting me daily.
Really?
I haven't given it a second thought.
But then it was easier for me, not being around it when I left.
Yeah, you did sort of vanish into the night.
So how was it?
How was what?
The wedding.
It...wasn't.
I-I mean, I -- it -- it didn't -- didn't happen.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
They're my grandmother's.
Um, I always loved them, and, well, it tends to keep the wolves at bay.
Yeah, well, got to keep those wolves at bay.
I was so sure there was something that was bringing him here.
Well, it wouldn't be the first blind alley we've been down with him.
Two new victims after nearly four years?
Something's triggering his kills, Jimmy, something new.
A stressor we haven't seen before.
- Well, I'm sure you've kept tabs on, uh...
- Tommy Ray Haynes?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's doing 22 months for a felony elude to evade down in Joliet.
[ Chuckles ] He always did like to run.
And you always did like him for it.
Look, if I'm right and he's here, why Florida, Jimmy?
Why this timeshare?
I mean, every female guest is accounted for.
Am I that far off base, or are we just missing something?
Or someone.
The guests were accounted for, not the employees.
Daniel, I need you to do something.
Ashley Whitfield, 26, fits the profile.
Hasn't been to work in three days.
That's not a good sign.
Ashley Whitfield?
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
The neighbor didn't see anything, but she did notice Ashley's car was missing.
The killer's never taken a victim's car before.
Well, who needs a car in Chicago?
Just a pain in the ass trying to find a place to park.
But Florida...
Detectives, I ran down the source of that voicemail message from Bob Wilson's machine like you asked me to.
Oh, like you asked him to?
It wasn't actually from the timeshare company itself.
It was from a call center in New Delhi.
They called from a master list of everyone from Chicago who visited Florida in the last six months -- over 40,000 people.
Records indicate they left that message five weeks ago, but there's no real way to trace who actually placed the call to Bob Wilson.
All right, yeah.
Hi.
Probably just one of thousands anyway.
You know what?
Get us an APB on Ashley Whitfield's car.
Right away.
[ Chuckles ]
Now.
Okay.
Carlos:
I won't know till I get her on a table.
But based on the bruising on her neck and throat, and what feels like a hyperextension of the larynx, manual strangulation appears to be the cause of death.
I could be more conclusive if they hadn't blacked out her eyes.
You can tell so much by the eyes.
- They obviously spoke to our killer.
- Yeah, and not in a good way.
- Thanks, Carlos.
Let us know.
- You got it.
There's no evidence of cigarette ash like in all the other crime scenes.
Or that special smoker smell.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I went ahead and e-filed with the commissioner's office to inform them that you'll be working this case with Detective Longworth.
Just remember that while you're here, you're working under his badge and under Florida law.
Y-you said this guy kills two women within days of each other, right?
That's been his pattern.
A new stressor in his life triggers such a need to kill, he kills once, then he kills again...
Then guilt or remorse sets in, and he stops, each time after two.
If this new pattern is anything like the old one, my guess is he's already chosen his next victim.
So find this guy -- fast.
Look, we have a pretty good idea where he and Ashley's paths crossed.
- I'm thinking we start --
- Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare, right?
What?
Ashley's dead?
From this s-serial killer that you're after?
We think her death might be related to the series, yeah.
How well did you know Ashley?
Not very.
She did her thing with the guests.
I did mine.
We didn't have a lot of interaction.
Interaction?
Well, did you see her interacting an unusual amount with anyone -- guests, co-worker, maybe?
Not really.
And we weren't co-workers in the traditional sense.
What does that mean?
She taught water aerobics to our guests, but she did that at a lot of places -- hotels, health clubs,
55-and-older planned communities.
Oh.
How's that going?
Pardon?
Nicorette.
I remember when I quit, the cravings just about drove me nuts.
Cancer sticks, yeah.
Uh, thank you, big tobacco.
Listen, it's terrible what happened to Ashley, and if there's anything that I can do, you let me know.
Sure.
- You never smoked.
- Not on purpose.
But he's definitely trying to quit.
In every other crime scene, there was physical evidence that our killer was a smoker, but not in Ashley's apartment.
Maybe our killer is trying to quit.
Not enough to bring him in but certainly enough to dig deeper.
And now that we've confirmed a victim in Florida, it's time to cross-check our list of persons of interest, see if anybody's migrated to the sunshine state.
Yeah.
Daniel.
Hey, I need you --
Hey.
Daniel, yeah.
No, it's me.
Listen, can you do a teensie-weensie little something for me?
"Teensie-weensie"?
[ ATM beeping ] What?
You said a little money, Ray.
Mrs. Cargill.
Oh, hey.
Uh, please, it's Callie.
Is everything all right?
Uh, no.
No.
Not even close.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, you know, seriously, I can handle the workload and the hours and juggling everyone else's schedule including my own, but when I can't get enough cash out of the machine to get a double half cap with splenda, then, you know...
Okay, so, uh...
[Chuckling] It's not that bad.
It's just some days I feel like I can't get ahead.
Amen to that.
Callie, you know, your family matters aside for the moment,
I've seen you at the office...
Oh, Jim.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
Not Jim.
Carlos, actually.
Carlos?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, Carlos is great.
He's actually helping me connect the dots between medical text books and, you know, what happens in the real world.
Exactly.
Let me make a few phone calls.
Calls?
Yeah.
You know, I -
- I might have an idea
I think could work for both of us.
Would you swing by the office tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Sure.
It's official.
Cause of death is manual strangulation.
Trace evidence of chloroform in throat and lungs.
Like the others.
The chloroform is how he disables his victims so he can do that weird dye thing to their eyes.
There's nothing unusual about the dye itself.
It's food coloring, like the kind you get at any grocery store.
Looks like it's your Northside strangler, all right.
Which, by the way, the moniker as it is -- a little lazy.
Hey, that's not on us.
The Tribune coined that expression.
Besides, we didn't want to stoke the guy's fire by giving him a cool, sexy name he felt he had to live up to.
You think he cared what you called him?
Oh, I think he followed our moves and our investigation very carefully.
Detective, that list of persons of interest you asked me to check on -- they're all accounted for in Illinois.
But the guy you thought is in a Joliet State Prison...
Tommy Ray Haynes.
He was released from prison two months ago.
What?
!
That's enough time to do the Chicago killings.
Damn it.
I checked on him earlier in the year.
They told me he had seven months left.
Overcrowding changed that.
I need you to check with the Illinois parole board, his parole officer -- get us a last known.
Director Manus already did that.
He listed his sister's address in Calumet City, but he never showed up.
And according to DMV records,
Tommy Ray Haynes has a cousin who lives here, in Homestead.
Manus:
You're calling from a bar?
Tommy Ray's not staying with his cousin because his cousin's wife hates him.
But he's in a white '96 Ford pickup that his cousin lent him, and we're at his cousin's bar.
Worst case -- he doesn't turn up.
We grab a beer.
Goodbye.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
All right, if you promise not to gloat,
I will admit that finding a victim and Tommy Ray in the same state, is a little more than a coincidence.
See?
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Actually, it was harder than it looked.
Fits the classic profile, Jimmy.
25 to 36 years old, white male, abandoned as a child, in and out of foster care his whole life.
I mean, guys like that, true sociopaths, have no real connection to anyone or anything.
Everything about Tommy Ray Haynes fits the profile -- of Tommy Ray Haynes.
Seriously?
Oh, my God.
You will not give up.
I'm just saying there's too much at stake to throw all our eggs into Tommy Ray's basket.
[ Sighs ]
Jim...
Look, despite what you may think,
I am truly sorry about what happened.
Hey, look, it's all in the past.
Just working together so closely, day and night, on an emotionally charged case, you know, things happen.
They did, yeah.
A bunch of times.
You knew what it was.
I didn't, actually.
I mean, I figured it out after three months when you told me you were engaged.
Then I realized exactly what it was.
Obviously, I was confused.
Yeah, look, and, hey -- it all worked out for the best, right?
And, actually, I've met someone down here.
- Really?
- Really...
If not a tad unavailable at the moment.
No pattern there.
You know, I asked around your precinct.
Even after the incident with your captain, you could have stayed in your department.
Why didn't you?
Oh, you know.
I...
I got the invitation to your wedding, just figured... needed a change of scenery.
So what happened?
I mean, cold feet?
Find him with his secretary?
Richard was a good man.
I thought he was the love of my life, but I was wrong.
[ Vehicle approaches ]
That's him.
Tommy Ray Haynes.
Go, go, go!
Cut him off!
[ Grunts ]
[ Dogs barking ]
Aah!
Down!
Get -- ow!
Down!
Get off!
[ Dog snarling, barking ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
You need any more convincing?
Hey, I put out a BOLO and sent a unit to his cousin's house.
Yeah, we impounded his pickup.
So at least for the moment, he's on foot.
We need to get Tommy Ray's photo out to every taxi and bus driver in the county.
Already did, and any reports of stolen vehicles will be sent directly to me immediately.
[ Cellphone rings ] Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah.
Let me see.
No.
It's fine.
Let me see.
See?
There are some advantages about being thick-skinned.
Didn't break the surface.
Still, you should probably get it looked at.
- You had a tetanus shot lately?
- Yeah, about a year ago.
What bit you then?
Or should I say "who"?
An alligator.
Well, caiman, actually.
They found Ashley Whitfield's car.
[ Indistinct conversation ]
[ Laughs ]
Here we go.
What here we go?
The way you look at Detective Harper.
I wasn't looking at her any way.
Only one other woman I've ever seen you look at like that, my friend.
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're wrong.
- I'm not.
Sam:
The service guy says Ashley dropped her car off four days ago, never came back to pick it up.
I showed him a picture of Tommy Ray Haynes, but he's never met him.
So much for the theory that the killer took her car.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean he was never in it.
- What do you got?
- Gum.
Smoker's gum?
Like the kind that helps you quit.
Yeah.
Ashley Whitfield was not a smoker.
And if Tommy Ray Haynes is trying to quit, he's doing a terrible job.
He stunk of nicotine when I fought him.
But we do know someone in the mix who is trying to quit.
And who obviously lied about his relationship with Ashley.
Even if the gum was mine, it doesn't prove that I killed Ashley.
Well, it proves you're a liar who had something to hide about a murdered woman.
That sort of usually goes hand in hand with the person that killed her.
I am not lying.
Ashley and I barely knew each other.
She gave me a ride once.
It was no big deal.
I'm not just talking about the gum, Jared.
We did our homework on you.
Well, actually, an enthusiastic paid intern did his homework on you.
The timeshare company that you work for, Sun 'n Lakes?
Yeah, they have a corporate headquarters in Elk Grove Village, a suburb of Chicago.
Okay.
So?
So, you've been with them for around six years, starting in about 2005.
That's the exact same time that the killings began.
But I don't live in Chicago.
I live here.
But for the first three years, you worked out of corporate headquarters.
And since then, you've been flying back and forth from here to Chicago.
Plenty of enough time to rev up, plan, and execute the murders.
I am telling you you got it all wrong.
I don't know anything about Ashley's murder, and I damn sure never killed anybody in Chicago.
We can put you with the victim, we can put you in Chicago at the exact time of each of the murders, and thanks to that intern I was talking about, who hooked up with FDLE fraud division,
we know that you may or may not be Jared Nolan.
So the question is, who the hell are you?
Terry McCabe, maybe?
Or Chad Crandall.
Chad -- really?
[ Scoffs ] That's just -- let me just go over here and find Bob Wilson so we can arrest you on the murders of two, maybe three --
I'm hoping all nine women.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
Fine.
[ Sighs ]
I'd been using my job to get credit-card information and selling it, but that is all.
And Jared Nolan is my real name.
Credit-card fraud, Jared?
Or maybe just aliases to hide your day job as a serial killer.
Red flags went up at corporate.
I needed another source.
Ashley was an aerobics instructor at Saw Grass Village, where her grandmother lived.
Saw Grass Village?
What?
A 55-and-older master-planned community.
Most of the units are filled with retired snowbirds from the Midwest.
Sue me.
Old people make soft targets --
You and Ashley worked this scam together?
No.
She never knew about it.
Ashley and I hooked up a couple of times.
I stole her password, I got the information from her computer.
She made friends with a lot of the older women, even after her grandmother died.
And Ashley being such a soft target, well, that was just too good to pass up, huh?
I really appreciate you thinking of me for this.
I mean, I've heard of forensic nursing.
I just never really saw myself pursuing it.
So think about it.
Look, the money's good, and the hours are flexible.
You wouldn't have to change jobs or quit going to med school.
You know, really, what it does is it lets you set the pace that works with your lifestyle and your crazy schedule.
- Director Manus.
- Yeah.
Oh, um, Callie, this is Detective Sam Harper.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be new.
I haven't seen you around.
Oh, I-I'm not from here.
I'm from Chicago.
Oh.
Jim's from Chicago.
Jim and I were partners on the Northside strangler case.
Ah.
He's amazing.
Yeah.
You got another suspect?
Person of interest.
We'll see if he graduates to suspect.
Okay.
Well, keep me in the loop on that.
Definitely.
Oh, uh, Callie.
Sam, this is Callie.
This is --
We've, uh -- We've met already.
Okay.
Oh.
Good.
Good.
Nice job in there, by the way.
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly a confession but definitely enough to hold him on, at least until we check out Saw Grass Village, where Ashley's grandmother lived.
Her grandmother?
I have a hunch.
Which we should probably check out, so, um, I-I'll see you later?
Actually, do you have a minute?
Oh, I'll -
- I'll -- I'll wait for you in the car.
I'll walk you out.
Sure.
Okay.
So, that's your old partner?
Unofficially.
Uh, actually, she was state.
I was Chicago local.
You two were together, weren't you?
I mean, Jim, I can tell.
For a while.
And now she's here?
For a while, Cal.
It's not a problem.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah. 18 months -- a lifetime ago, right?
She means nothing to me.
But clearly she did.
I get that we have people in our past.
It's just you never bothered to mention her to me?
Well...
[ Scoffs ]
Look, no.
You're right.
You're right.
I -- right, I probably should have.
But Sam lives Chicago.
I live here.
The sooner we catch this guy, the sooner she goes home.
I really got to go.
Yeah.
Go.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
No, I'm not eliminating Jared as a suspect.
I'm saying, if Ashley spent time here, maybe our killer did, too.
This is a 55-and-older community.
Ashley's grandmother was in her 70s.
That's a decade outside of our killer's target victimology.
Yeah, but not a 26-year-old granddaughter.
She made friends with her grandmother's pals.
Maybe one of those pals meant something to the killer.
[ Scoffs ]
Hey, I said it was a hunch.
You were the one that said he was looking for a new hunting ground.
I did say that, didn't I?
Yeah.
Hey, so, uh, Callie's pretty hot.
It's -- you never mentioned who, just that you'd met someone.
Can we...
Oh, fine.
Jared Nolan stole identities.
Maybe he stole "Bob Wilson,"
rented himself a house in Chicago, didn't realize that the name had been recycled back through the system.
But Jared Nolan isn't running.
Tommy Ray is.
Yeah, the Northside killer was never about outrunning us.
He was about outsmarting us.
Or trying to.
There.
You see?
A hunch.
[ Sighs ]
Tragic what happened to Ashley.
Such a sweet girl, always helping out.
But not to speak ill of the departed, but she and her grandma were the only ones that could handle Doris.
Northside Braille Institute.
Gulf Coast School for the Blind.
Southeast Services for the Blind.
Doris was devoted to helping the blind.
Not exactly the warmest person.
Blind devotion?
Try obsession.
Try I think we found it.
Found what?
The stressor we never saw before, the reason he's been killing.
Off the top of my head?
I'm going with mom.
Jim:
What do you got?
Not sure.
I'm thinking flour, like for baking.
As in that evidence you're about to eat --
Yep.
Six weeks stale.
Just confirming it.
I'll run this to the lab.
So, what does all this mean?
It means our previous assumptions about why he blacked out the victims' eyes is wrong.
It wasn't shame.
It was anger.
At blind people?
At his mother's devotion for the blind -- love she showed them, but not him.
Doris Fowler died in a hospice, completely alone.
No one ever came to visit her.
No one claimed the body.
Ashley made all the arrangements.
Hmm, all these people she gave her life to, and no one even cared to come see her?
She didn't give a rat's ass about them.
She gave a rat's ass about this -- look at me, how amazing I am.
"Giving" of myself.
Not even her own family?
Well, she only had one son -- Kevin Fowler.
Estranged, apparently.
Management's never met him or spoken to him, and there's no record of him ever visiting his mother.
Yeah, in my experience, serial killers don't sign the guest book.
So, Doris Fowler moves from Chicago.
His anger dissipates.
The killings stop.
She's diagnosed with cancer, forcing contact.
The pressure builds up again.
Six weeks later, she dies.
And the killings resume -- twin Chicago, and now here.
Which tells us what?
It tells us the pain of being denied his mother's attention was so profound, his anger so intense that he wanted to kill her.
But he couldn't.
So he kills surrogates.
First one, then another.
Women that triggered the rage he had for his mother, until he worked up the nerve to kill her.
But she gets diagnosed with cancer, triggers the need to kill again.
And then dies, the selfish bitch, robbing him of the chance of killing her and ending his agony.
So he kills Ashley Whitfield.
The question now is, who the hell is Kevin Fowler?
We know Jared nolan used identities.
Well, Doris Fowler was devoted to helping others.
Maybe she took in foster children just to add another notch to her belt.
Tommy Ray Haynes was in and out of foster care.
There you go.
Try that.
Uh, what's going on in here?
Dad's showing me how to make his famous three-cheese lasagna.
His three-cheese lasagna.
I haven't had that in a while.
I saw that you put the money in the account ahead of schedule.
Yeah, a couple good nights.
Look, this is gonna be ready in an hour.
If you want to grab a beer and go sit out on the porch.
I'd love to, but, um, I picked up a shift.
So...
Okay.
Well, then, uh, we'll save you a plate, and you can nuke it when you get home.
Okay.
And Tommy Ray Haynes bounced in and out of the foster care system his whole life, and Doris Fowler did take in foster children in Illinois.
You do know how long it'll take to unseal Tommy Ray's juvie record, right?
Try weeks.
No.
We don't have weeks.
Another body will probably turn up in the next couple of days, if not sooner.
All right, look, I'll reach out to a judge buddy of mine, see if I can expedite that.
Thank you.
This is what we never had before -- the rage he had for his mother.
He's been killing nurturers and caregivers, women he wanted his mother to be.
Why didn't I see this before?
Because we could never connect the victims to a single victimology -- I mean, we've got moms, career women, women who volunteered --
All with nurturing qualities, love and attention they gave to other people.
But not Crystal Benson.
The stripper.
Crystal had no children.
She was in and out of prison, drug rehab.
She could barely take care of herself.
She doesn't fit the profile, which, of course, as we all know, if one thing doesn't fit...
Then none of it fits, and you have nothing.
Or does she?
Okay, you really need to have that looked at.
No, no, no.
There's no time.
It's not what we see that made them victims.
It's what he saw and probably, no doubt, the thing that he sees in his next victim.
I mean, we've got three stay-at-home moms, two educators, a social worker.
He's obviously targeting them for their nurturing quality -- love and attention that they gave to others -- including Crystal.
I don't know, Jim.
The stripper's a stretch.
Her stage name -- Florence Nightingale.
A nurse.
It's probably nothing, but you never want to take your chances with a dog bite.
That wasn't that bad, was it?
Nah, I'm good.
She usually picks up.
I'm sure she's fine.
During his first spree, who gave the killer the most attention, Sam?
It was us.
It was you and me.
This whole time, I've had this feeling -- the killings in Chicago, now here Florida.
What if he's been watching us, knew I was in Florida, knows who I'm close to?
[ Cellphone ringing ] Callie?
No, it's me.
I checked stolen car reports like you asked.
Any with GPS?
Any at the hospital?
Unfortunately, yes.
[ Tires screech ]
Callie Cargill?
Have you seen her?
Not in the last hour or so.
[ Indistinct shouting ]
[ Gasps ]
Man:
Hey!
Stay back!
[ Indistinct shouting ]
[ Gasping ]
Get off!
Where's Callie?
!
Get off me!
Where is she?
!
You're not gonna pin this on me!
You couldn't before!
You can't now!
Get off me!
You got him?
You got him?
Go, go.
I got him.
Go.
Get down!
Stay down!
[ Gun cocks ]
Callie?
Callie!
Callie?
Oh, my God!
Hey!
What the --
Oh, my God.
Jim, what's wrong?
Did you treat a guy for a dog bite earlier?
Yeah.
About 20 minutes ago, why?
Wait, is that the serial killer you guys are after?
I mean, the whole hospital is freaking out.
Jim...
Tommy Ray is in custody -- raving mad and still not cooperating, but, you know, at least he's off the street.
Callie, are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't even know I was in trouble.
All right, well...
Congratulations, Jim.
This one's a long time coming.
[ Sighs ] Come on.
I'm sure after all this time, it's probably pretty hard to believe it's all over.
Wh-- uh, yeah.
Thanks.
It is over, Jim.
Go and celebrate with that partner of yours.
You both have it coming to you.
Actually, I do need to check if she's all right.
Yeah, of course.
No, go.
Carlos:
Well, that's got to feel good, getting that monkey off your back.
I guess.
You guess?
It's time to celebrate, amigo.
[ Laughs ]
You on your way back?
I'll buy you and Sam a drink.
Yeah, I got to file my report.
And I think Sam's got a slightly different celebration in mind.
Yeah.
I'm sure she does.
No.
She just wants to kick back and catch a few rays.
I told her I'd throw some spiny lobster on the grill.
She's on the first flight back to Chicago in the morning.
Which reminds me, uh, Sam was bugging me about that white substance we found in Doris Fowler's condo.
Results came back.
It's diatomaceous earth.
What's it?
It's used in pool filtration.
[ Siren walls ]
[ Sighs ]
You startled me.
Hello, Detective Harper.
[ Grunting ] Shh.
[ Echoing ] But not your partner.
He -- he -- he just wanted to catch me.
[ Normal voice ] Not like you, Detective Harper.
You knew what I was going through.
You knew what I saw when I -- when I looked at those women -- giving others the love and attention that i deserved.
But she wouldn't give it to me, would she?
No, not mom, not the great Doris Fowler.
She gave everything she had to others!
But you knew that, didn't you, Detective Harper?
You knew because, deep down, you are just like them, aren't you -- always thinking of someone else, somebody other than yourself...
Unlike your partner, who only thinks of himself.
[ Gasping ]
Well, let's see how he feels about this, huh?
See how he feels when he sees what I have waiting for him.
[ Gunshot ] Aah!
[ Grunting ]
[ Sirens wail ]
He showed up five weeks ago, said he was taking over the pool business from his cousin who just moved to Seattle.
No doubt we'll find his cousin rotting in the swamp.
It's too bad.
Kevin Fowler actually did a better job on my pool.
[ Chuckles ]
Hey, and thank God for that unsettled feeling of yours.
We are done now, right?
Uh, Jared Nolan committed credit-card fraud...
Mm-hmm.
...Tommy Ray Haynes flapping his gums in prison has him being investigated under a totally unrelated murder, and Kevin Fowler killed nine women, including my pool guy.
Three bad guys for the price of one, so, yeah.
Yeah, I'd say we're done.
Carlos:
She'll have some bruising, but it'll go away.
Still, you need to be checked out at a hospital, okay?
I'll go get the medics.
Much better.
Chalk this up to that really special way you have of getting under people's skin.
Hey, seemed he was a lot madder at you than he was at me.
Only thing he did to me was clean my pool.
His mom moving away at least allowed him to control his urges.
Then once he lost the opportunity to kill his mom, figured next best thing -- get us together for his last big hurrah.
Well, we were the only people that actually cared about him.
Which is either really sad or really twisted.
So...
Um...
We never had a chance to finish our conversation.
Yeah.
Well, you're leaving now, so...
I'm not, actually.
You're not leaving?
Well, I have to interview Fowler, do my debriefing ahead of his extradition.
See if I can link him to any other missing persons.
Why?
My sticking around isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
What?
Uh, no.
No, no.
Uh, why would it be?
I don't know.
It's -- just checking.

Show me.
It's him.
He told me his name was Bob Wilson.
He paid cash every month for 2 1/2 years.
Till about six weeks ago, he just disappeared.
You run a credit check, grab a social, photo I.D.?
No.
You rented a house to a guy you never laid eyes on?
I rented a house to his 950 bucks a month.
That's not a crime, is it?
Hold this.
Hello.
This is a courtesy call for Bob Wilson.
Thank you for your recent visit to Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare here in sunny South Florida.
We look forward to seeing you soon for your complimentary, all-expenses-paid weekend at our fabulous four-star resort.
Hey.
Hi.
I just...wanted to call and say "hi."
"Hi" to you.
Jeff and Ray are doing yardwork.
Giving you a chance to call and say "hi."
How you doing?
We're good.
We're hanging in there.
Super soaker?
Uh, hall -- hall.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you should, uh...
Yeah, I need to...go.
Ah.
Uh, it's none of my business, but I can see the pool hasn't been used much lately.
Uh, a friend's son used to come over and use it.
If I cut back to twice a month, you could probably save a few bucks.
Um...
Let me think about it?
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, I used to pay your cousin online.
Uh, yeah, I'm not really set up for that.
I'm not much of a computer guy.
Me neither.
All right, check it is.
Okay.
Oh, uh, y-you want a check now?
Why?
I haven't done anything, yet.
Nice place.
Yeah, it's, uh...
It's good to see you, too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
How are you?
How's tricks?
Long time, no see.
Is that better?
Jim, he's back.
Are you sure it's him?
White female, 25 to 32, dirty-blond hair, blacked-out eyes.
Yeah, I'm sure.
And you're in my backyard...
Why?
Because I believe the Northside strangler is here in Florida.
♪ The Glades 2x02 ♪ Old Ghosts Original Air Date on June 12, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The Northside strangler?
Between '05 and late 2008, he was linked with the abduction and murder of six women -- these two make eight.
Now eight.
I headed up the Chicago side of the task force with Detective Harper of the Illinois State Bureau for almost four years.
Until our unsub went dormant and our trail turned to ice.
A message from Sun 'n Lakes Timeshares was left on our suspect's phone three days ago.
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
What I found two days ago in Chicago is the first activity we've clocked in 2 1/2 years.
Okay, fine.
But what makes you -- or, rather, her -- think that the unsub is here?
Detective Harper seems to think that he's searching for a new hunting ground.
He's territorial -- six kills within the same 8 square miles, then stops -- imprisonment, maybe injury -- then kills again in the same zone with the same victimology and the same blacked-out eyes,
then bolts in the middle of the night to visit timeshares in Florida.
He's on the move, and my guess is he's gonna kill again soon.
She sounds pretty confident.
Yeah.
That's one word for it.
Okay, fine, but, uh, while she's here, she's your problem.
And that's another.
Thanks.
Thanks for your time.
Ah.
You must be Mr. and Mrs...
Uh, Longworth and Harper.
Detectives Longworth and Harper.
Oh.
I thought you were here for the promotion.
Maybe.
What are you offering?
Well, we have a fantastic offer.
By attending a one-day presentation, we are gifting a complimentary two days of tennis, golf, and fabulous food at our world-class facility.
Sounds good.
How many sales pitches do we have to sit through for that?
Well, they're not pitches, per se, but there are a series of guest meetings throughout the week.
Ah.
Now, did a Bob Wilson attend one of those "guest meetings"?
Maybe.
Uh, is there some trouble?
We believe he may have killed eight women.
A-a serial killer?
Yeah, who may have attended one of your presentations, so, uh, if we could loop back around to that question?
Yes.
We do have a Bob Wilson in our records.
And he was scheduled to attend two weeks ago, but he never showed up.
But he did attend this past weekend.
Can you describe him?
Uh, between the Sun 'n Lakes and, uh,
Citrus Estates locations, we have over 340 guests.
I notice a lot of your guests are wearing I.D. badges.
Can you give us a copy of Bob Wilson's?
We take I.D.s after lunch, and it looks like he left after the first session in the morning.
Didn't want his picture taken.
Any of your female guests not return after lunch?
All the women came back except a Margaret Palmer did not come back after the first day.
Meaning she sat through the presentation but didn't stick around for the cool free shit?
Do you have her picture?
You got an address for this Margaret Palmer?
She was just here on vacation, and she was staying at the Westin.
Fits the profile.
According to our records,
Margaret Palmer hasn't used her room card in two days.
When is she scheduled to check out?
She's booked through tomorrow.
I'll check the bedroom.
Thank you.
Who the fuck are you?
Oh.
Ms. Palmer?
Get out!
No, no, no, wait.
I'm Jim Longworth.
I'm FDLE.
Get out!
Watch it!
Watch it!
You're gonna...
Stun yourself.
I see you haven't lost your touch with the ladies.
If we'd dug a little deeper, we would have realized that other than a vague physical resemblance,
Margaret Palmer did not fit our victimology.
Yeah, she required the assistance of a walking cane.
He's never targeted the weak before.
Was there any forensic evidence that pulled it all together?
There was never any physical evidence, no DNA to link him to the victims.
Although there was ash from a cigarette found on every victim, so we assume our killer's a smoker.
Anything that linked the victims together?
Apart from Chicago and general physical similarities, nothing.
We have two school teachers, a speech therapist, a social worker...
A crossing guard, and three stay-at-home moms.
Hmm.
Not like any stay-at-home mom I've ever seen.
Oh, Crystal Benson was a stripper.
Worked a pole right in the middle of our kill zone.
Which begs the question -- was there any sexual assault?
No.
No sexual component.
Violence is sex for them.
It's at the heart of their urges.
Which is what we think is behind the weird blackening of the eyes thing.
Yeah, what's that about?
Shame -- at who he is and what he's done.
So he can't look back at them.
Hmm.
3 1/2 years you guys lived in this guy's head -- that explains you.
But you?
You got lucky.
I did?
Awesome.
Yeah.
Margaret Palmer decided not to press charges.
Yeah, I wasn't even in the room, so...
Detective Harper, I like to asset share as much as the next lawman, but in case you haven't noticed, this is Florida, meaning we've got no shortage of deviants to track down.
So until or unless you can show me some evidence of your Northside strangler -- like, I don't know, a body --
I'm gonna need to take my bodies back.
I love her.
Seriously, she's awesome.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, is this yours?
Will be in two years when I pay off the loan.
This is awesome.
Come on.
Jump inside.
Look at it.
All right.
Well, look at you, all official.
So, how did you...
Oh, uh, a buddy of mine.
Him and his wife kind of got knocked up, so...
Kind of got knocked up?
Yeah.
So, money was tight, and they let me take over the payments.
That's industrious.
Yeah, well, lets me hit the ground running, you know, be my own boss.
Oh, um, I t-took some money out of our joint account, just for, like, the first payment and gas and stuff like that.
I hope that's okay.
Yeah, of course.
No, that's your money, too.
Promise I'll have it back in there by the end of the week.
Really, it's not a problem.
Hey, can we take it for a ride?
Absolutely.
Let's go.
Load up.
All right.
Come on, mom.
There's room for you.
I should, uh, start on the laundry, but you guys have fun.
You really want these women staring back at you again?
Or not staring back.
I can't tell you how many times I've done this, stand there, staring at his victims.
Agonizing over what we could have overlooked.
So much of those 3 1/2 years just haunting me daily.
Really?
I haven't given it a second thought.
But then it was easier for me, not being around it when I left.
Yeah, you did sort of vanish into the night.
So how was it?
How was what?
The wedding.
It...wasn't.
I-I mean, I -- it -- it didn't -- didn't happen.
Oh.
They're my grandmother's.
Um, I always loved them, and, well, it tends to keep the wolves at bay.
Yeah, well, got to keep those wolves at bay.
I was so sure there was something that was bringing him here.
Well, it wouldn't be the first blind alley we've been down with him.
Two new victims after nearly four years?
Something's triggering his kills, Jimmy, something new.
A stressor we haven't seen before.
- Well, I'm sure you've kept tabs on, uh...
- Tommy Ray Haynes?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's doing 22 months for a felony elude to evade down in Joliet.
He always did like to run.
And you always did like him for it.
Look, if I'm right and he's here, why Florida, Jimmy?
Why this timeshare?
I mean, every female guest is accounted for.
Am I that far off base, or are we just missing something?
Or someone.
The guests were accounted for, not the employees.
Daniel, I need you to do something.
Ashley Whitfield, 26, fits the profile.
Hasn't been to work in three days.
That's not a good sign.
Ashley Whitfield?
The neighbor didn't see anything, but she did notice Ashley's car was missing.
The killer's never taken a victim's car before.
Well, who needs a car in Chicago?
Just a pain in the ass trying to find a place to park.
But Florida...
Detectives, I ran down the source of that voicemail message from Bob Wilson's machine like you asked me to.
Oh, like you asked him to?
It wasn't actually from the timeshare company itself.
It was from a call center in New Delhi.
They called from a master list of everyone from Chicago who visited Florida in the last six months -- over 40,000 people.
Records indicate they left that message five weeks ago, but there's no real way to trace who actually placed the call to Bob Wilson.
All right, yeah.
Hi.
Probably just one of thousands anyway.
You know what?
Get us an APB on Ashley Whitfield's car.
Right away.
Now.
Okay.
I won't know till I get her on a table.
But based on the bruising on her neck and throat, and what feels like a hyperextension of the larynx, manual strangulation appears to be the cause of death.
I could be more conclusive if they hadn't blacked out her eyes.
You can tell so much by the eyes.
- They obviously spoke to our killer.
- Yeah, and not in a good way.
- Thanks, Carlos.
Let us know.
- You got it.
There's no evidence of cigarette ash like in all the other crime scenes.
Or that special smoker smell.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I went ahead and e-filed with the commissioner's office to inform them that you'll be working this case with Detective Longworth.
Just remember that while you're here, you're working under his badge and under Florida law.
Y-you said this guy kills two women within days of each other, right?
That's been his pattern.
A new stressor in his life triggers such a need to kill, he kills once, then he kills again...
Then guilt or remorse sets in, and he stops, each time after two.
If this new pattern is anything like the old one, my guess is he's already chosen his next victim.
So find this guy -- fast.
Look, we have a pretty good idea where he and Ashley's paths crossed.
- I'm thinking we start --
- Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare, right?
What?
Ashley's dead?
From this s-serial killer that you're after?
We think her death might be related to the series, yeah.
How well did you know Ashley?
Not very.
She did her thing with the guests.
I did mine.
We didn't have a lot of interaction.
Interaction?
Well, did you see her interacting an unusual amount with anyone -- guests, co-worker, maybe?
Not really.
And we weren't co-workers in the traditional sense.
What does that mean?
She taught water aerobics to our guests, but she did that at a lot of places -- hotels, health clubs,
55-and-older planned communities.
Oh.
How's that going?
Pardon?
Nicorette.
I remember when I quit, the cravings just about drove me nuts.
Cancer sticks, yeah.
Uh, thank you, big tobacco.
Listen, it's terrible what happened to Ashley, and if there's anything that I can do, you let me know.
Sure.
- You never smoked.
- Not on purpose.
But he's definitely trying to quit.
In every other crime scene, there was physical evidence that our killer was a smoker, but not in Ashley's apartment.
Maybe our killer is trying to quit.
Not enough to bring him in but certainly enough to dig deeper.
And now that we've confirmed a victim in Florida, it's time to cross-check our list of persons of interest, see if anybody's migrated to the sunshine state.
Yeah.
Daniel.
Hey, I need you --
Hey.
Daniel, yeah.
No, it's me.
Listen, can you do a teensie-weensie little something for me?
"Teensie-weensie"?
What?
You said a little money, Ray.
Mrs. Cargill.
Oh, hey.
Uh, please, it's Callie.
Is everything all right?
Uh, no.
No.
Not even close.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, you know, seriously, I can handle the workload and the hours and juggling everyone else's schedule including my own, but when I can't get enough cash out of the machine to get a double half cap with splenda, then, you know...
Okay, so, uh...
It's not that bad.
It's just some days I feel like I can't get ahead.
Amen to that.
Callie, you know, your family matters aside for the moment,
I've seen you at the office...
Oh, Jim.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
Not Jim.
Carlos, actually.
Carlos?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, Carlos is great.
He's actually helping me connect the dots between medical text books and, you know, what happens in the real world.
Exactly.
Let me make a few phone calls.
Calls?
Yeah.
You know, I -
- I might have an idea
I think could work for both of us.
Would you swing by the office tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Sure.
It's official.
Cause of death is manual strangulation.
Trace evidence of chloroform in throat and lungs.
Like the others.
The chloroform is how he disables his victims so he can do that weird dye thing to their eyes.
There's nothing unusual about the dye itself.
It's food coloring, like the kind you get at any grocery store.
Looks like it's your Northside strangler, all right.
Which, by the way, the moniker as it is -- a little lazy.
Hey, that's not on us.
The Tribune coined that expression.
Besides, we didn't want to stoke the guy's fire by giving him a cool, sexy name he felt he had to live up to.
You think he cared what you called him?
Oh, I think he followed our moves and our investigation very carefully.
Detective, that list of persons of interest you asked me to check on -- they're all accounted for in Illinois.
But the guy you thought is in a Joliet State Prison...
Tommy Ray Haynes.
He was released from prison two months ago.
What?
!
That's enough time to do the Chicago killings.
Damn it.
I checked on him earlier in the year.
They told me he had seven months left.
Overcrowding changed that.
I need you to check with the Illinois parole board, his parole officer -- get us a last known.
Director Manus already did that.
He listed his sister's address in Calumet City, but he never showed up.
And according to DMV records,
Tommy Ray Haynes has a cousin who lives here, in Homestead.
You're calling from a bar?
Tommy Ray's not staying with his cousin because his cousin's wife hates him.
But he's in a white '96 Ford pickup that his cousin lent him, and we're at his cousin's bar.
Worst case -- he doesn't turn up.
We grab a beer.
Goodbye.
All right, if you promise not to gloat,
I will admit that finding a victim and Tommy Ray in the same state, is a little more than a coincidence.
See?
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Actually, it was harder than it looked.
Fits the classic profile, Jimmy.
25 to 36 years old, white male, abandoned as a child, in and out of foster care his whole life.
I mean, guys like that, true sociopaths, have no real connection to anyone or anything.
Everything about Tommy Ray Haynes fits the profile -- of Tommy Ray Haynes.
Seriously?
Oh, my God.
You will not give up.
I'm just saying there's too much at stake to throw all our eggs into Tommy Ray's basket.
Jim...
Look, despite what you may think,
I am truly sorry about what happened.
Hey, look, it's all in the past.
Just working together so closely, day and night, on an emotionally charged case, you know, things happen.
They did, yeah.
A bunch of times.
You knew what it was.
I didn't, actually.
I mean, I figured it out after three months when you told me you were engaged.
Then I realized exactly what it was.
Obviously, I was confused.
Yeah, look, and, hey -- it all worked out for the best, right?
And, actually, I've met someone down here.
- Really?
- Really...
If not a tad unavailable at the moment.
No pattern there.
You know, I asked around your precinct.
Even after the incident with your captain, you could have stayed in your department.
Why didn't you?
Oh, you know.
I...
I got the invitation to your wedding, just figured... needed a change of scenery.
So what happened?
I mean, cold feet?
Find him with his secretary?
Richard was a good man.
I thought he was the love of my life, but I was wrong.
That's him.
Tommy Ray Haynes.
Go, go, go!
Cut him off!
Aah!
Down!
Get -- ow!
Down!
Get off!
You need any more convincing?
Hey, I put out a BOLO and sent a unit to his cousin's house.
Yeah, we impounded his pickup.
So at least for the moment, he's on foot.
We need to get Tommy Ray's photo out to every taxi and bus driver in the county.
Already did, and any reports of stolen vehicles will be sent directly to me immediately.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah.
Let me see.
No.
It's fine.
Let me see.
See?
There are some advantages about being thick-skinned.
Didn't break the surface.
Still, you should probably get it looked at.
- You had a tetanus shot lately?
- Yeah, about a year ago.
What bit you then?
Or should I say "who"?
An alligator.
Well, caiman, actually.
They found Ashley Whitfield's car.
Here we go.
What here we go?
The way you look at Detective Harper.
I wasn't looking at her any way.
Only one other woman I've ever seen you look at like that, my friend.
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're wrong.
- I'm not.
The service guy says Ashley dropped her car off four days ago, never came back to pick it up.
I showed him a picture of Tommy Ray Haynes, but he's never met him.
So much for the theory that the killer took her car.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean he was never in it.
- What do you got?
- Gum.
Smoker's gum?
Like the kind that helps you quit.
Yeah.
Ashley Whitfield was not a smoker.
And if Tommy Ray Haynes is trying to quit, he's doing a terrible job.
He stunk of nicotine when I fought him.
But we do know someone in the mix who is trying to quit.
And who obviously lied about his relationship with Ashley.
Even if the gum was mine, it doesn't prove that I killed Ashley.
Well, it proves you're a liar who had something to hide about a murdered woman.
That sort of usually goes hand in hand with the person that killed her.
I am not lying.
Ashley and I barely knew each other.
She gave me a ride once.
It was no big deal.
I'm not just talking about the gum, Jared.
We did our homework on you.
Well, actually, an enthusiastic paid intern did his homework on you.
The timeshare company that you work for, Sun 'n Lakes?
Yeah, they have a corporate headquarters in Elk Grove Village, a suburb of Chicago.
Okay.
So?
So, you've been with them for around six years, starting in about 2005.
That's the exact same time that the killings began.
But I don't live in Chicago.
I live here.
But for the first three years, you worked out of corporate headquarters.
And since then, you've been flying back and forth from here to Chicago.
Plenty of enough time to rev up, plan, and execute the murders.
I am telling you you got it all wrong.
I don't know anything about Ashley's murder, and I damn sure never killed anybody in Chicago.
We can put you with the victim, we can put you in Chicago at the exact time of each of the murders, and thanks to that intern I was talking about, who hooked up with FDLE fraud division,
we know that you may or may not be Jared Nolan.
So the question is, who the hell are you?
Terry McCabe, maybe?
Or Chad Crandall.
Chad -- really?
That's just -- let me just go over here and find Bob Wilson so we can arrest you on the murders of two, maybe three --
I'm hoping all nine women.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
Fine.
I'd been using my job to get credit-card information and selling it, but that is all.
And Jared Nolan is my real name.
Credit-card fraud, Jared?
Or maybe just aliases to hide your day job as a serial killer.
Red flags went up at corporate.
I needed another source.
Ashley was an aerobics instructor at Saw Grass Village, where her grandmother lived.
Saw Grass Village?
What?
A 55-and-older master-planned community.
Most of the units are filled with retired snowbirds from the Midwest.
Sue me.
Old people make soft targets --
You and Ashley worked this scam together?
No.
She never knew about it.
Ashley and I hooked up a couple of times.
I stole her password, I got the information from her computer.
She made friends with a lot of the older women, even after her grandmother died.
And Ashley being such a soft target, well, that was just too good to pass up, huh?
I really appreciate you thinking of me for this.
I mean, I've heard of forensic nursing.
I just never really saw myself pursuing it.
So think about it.
Look, the money's good, and the hours are flexible.
You wouldn't have to change jobs or quit going to med school.
You know, really, what it does is it lets you set the pace that works with your lifestyle and your crazy schedule.
- Director Manus.
- Yeah.
Oh, um, Callie, this is Detective Sam Harper.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be new.
I haven't seen you around.
Oh, I-I'm not from here.
I'm from Chicago.
Oh.
Jim's from Chicago.
Jim and I were partners on the Northside strangler case.
Ah.
He's amazing.
Yeah.
You got another suspect?
Person of interest.
We'll see if he graduates to suspect.
Okay.
Well, keep me in the loop on that.
Definitely.
Oh, uh, Callie.
Sam, this is Callie.
This is --
We've, uh -- We've met already.
Okay.
Oh.
Good.
Good.
Nice job in there, by the way.
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly a confession but definitely enough to hold him on, at least until we check out Saw Grass Village, where Ashley's grandmother lived.
Her grandmother?
I have a hunch.
Which we should probably check out, so, um, I-I'll see you later?
Actually, do you have a minute?
Oh, I'll -
- I'll -- I'll wait for you in the car.
I'll walk you out.
Sure.
Okay.
So, that's your old partner?
Unofficially.
Uh, actually, she was state.
I was Chicago local.
You two were together, weren't you?
I mean, Jim, I can tell.
For a while.
And now she's here?
For a while, Cal.
It's not a problem.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah. 18 months -- a lifetime ago, right?
She means nothing to me.
But clearly she did.
I get that we have people in our past.
It's just you never bothered to mention her to me?
Well...
Look, no.
You're right.
You're right.
I -- right, I probably should have.
But Sam lives Chicago.
I live here.
The sooner we catch this guy, the sooner she goes home.
I really got to go.
Yeah.
Go.
No, I'm not eliminating Jared as a suspect.
I'm saying, if Ashley spent time here, maybe our killer did, too.
This is a 55-and-older community.
Ashley's grandmother was in her 70s.
That's a decade outside of our killer's target victimology.
Yeah, but not a 26-year-old granddaughter.
She made friends with her grandmother's pals.
Maybe one of those pals meant something to the killer.
Hey, I said it was a hunch.
You were the one that said he was looking for a new hunting ground.
I did say that, didn't I?
Yeah.
Hey, so, uh, Callie's pretty hot.
It's -- you never mentioned who, just that you'd met someone.
Can we...
Oh, fine.
Jared Nolan stole identities.
Maybe he stole "Bob Wilson,"
rented himself a house in Chicago, didn't realize that the name had been recycled back through the system.
But Jared Nolan isn't running.
Tommy Ray is.
Yeah, the Northside killer was never about outrunning us.
He was about outsmarting us.
Or trying to.
There.
You see?
A hunch.
Tragic what happened to Ashley.
Such a sweet girl, always helping out.
But not to speak ill of the departed, but she and her grandma were the only ones that could handle Doris.
Northside Braille Institute.
Gulf Coast School for the Blind.
Southeast Services for the Blind.
Doris was devoted to helping the blind.
Not exactly the warmest person.
Blind devotion?
Try obsession.
Try I think we found it.
Found what?
The stressor we never saw before, the reason he's been killing.
Off the top of my head?
I'm going with mom.
What do you got?
Not sure.
I'm thinking flour, like for baking.
As in that evidence you're about to eat --
Yep.
Six weeks stale.
Just confirming it.
I'll run this to the lab.
So, what does all this mean?
It means our previous assumptions about why he blacked out the victims' eyes is wrong.
It wasn't shame.
It was anger.
At blind people?
At his mother's devotion for the blind -- love she showed them, but not him.
Doris Fowler died in a hospice, completely alone.
No one ever came to visit her.
No one claimed the body.
Ashley made all the arrangements.
Hmm, all these people she gave her life to, and no one even cared to come see her?
She didn't give a rat's ass about them.
She gave a rat's ass about this -- look at me, how amazing I am.
"Giving" of myself.
Not even her own family?
Well, she only had one son -- Kevin Fowler.
Estranged, apparently.
Management's never met him or spoken to him, and there's no record of him ever visiting his mother.
Yeah, in my experience, serial killers don't sign the guest book.
So, Doris Fowler moves from Chicago.
His anger dissipates.
The killings stop.
She's diagnosed with cancer, forcing contact.
The pressure builds up again.
Six weeks later, she dies.
And the killings resume -- twin Chicago, and now here.
Which tells us what?
It tells us the pain of being denied his mother's attention was so profound, his anger so intense that he wanted to kill her.
But he couldn't.
So he kills surrogates.
First one, then another.
Women that triggered the rage he had for his mother, until he worked up the nerve to kill her.
But she gets diagnosed with cancer, triggers the need to kill again.
And then dies, the selfish bitch, robbing him of the chance of killing her and ending his agony.
So he kills Ashley Whitfield.
The question now is, who the hell is Kevin Fowler?
We know Jared nolan used identities.
Well, Doris Fowler was devoted to helping others.
Maybe she took in foster children just to add another notch to her belt.
Tommy Ray Haynes was in and out of foster care.
There you go.
Try that.
Uh, what's going on in here?
Dad's showing me how to make his famous three-cheese lasagna.
His three-cheese lasagna.
I haven't had that in a while.
I saw that you put the money in the account ahead of schedule.
Yeah, a couple good nights.
Look, this is gonna be ready in an hour.
If you want to grab a beer and go sit out on the porch.
I'd love to, but, um, I picked up a shift.
So...
Okay.
Well, then, uh, we'll save you a plate, and you can nuke it when you get home.
Okay.
And Tommy Ray Haynes bounced in and out of the foster care system his whole life, and Doris Fowler did take in foster children in Illinois.
You do know how long it'll take to unseal Tommy Ray's juvie record, right?
Try weeks.
No.
We don't have weeks.
Another body will probably turn up in the next couple of days, if not sooner.
All right, look, I'll reach out to a judge buddy of mine, see if I can expedite that.
Thank you.
This is what we never had before -- the rage he had for his mother.
He's been killing nurturers and caregivers, women he wanted his mother to be.
Why didn't I see this before?
Because we could never connect the victims to a single victimology -- I mean, we've got moms, career women, women who volunteered --
All with nurturing qualities, love and attention they gave to other people.
But not Crystal Benson.
The stripper.
Crystal had no children.
She was in and out of prison, drug rehab.
She could barely take care of herself.
She doesn't fit the profile, which, of course, as we all know, if one thing doesn't fit...
Then none of it fits, and you have nothing.
Or does she?
Okay, you really need to have that looked at.
No, no, no.
There's no time.
It's not what we see that made them victims.
It's what he saw and probably, no doubt, the thing that he sees in his next victim.
I mean, we've got three stay-at-home moms, two educators, a social worker.
He's obviously targeting them for their nurturing quality -- love and attention that they gave to others -- including Crystal.
I don't know, Jim.
The stripper's a stretch.
Her stage name -- Florence Nightingale.
A nurse.
It's probably nothing, but you never want to take your chances with a dog bite.
That wasn't that bad, was it?
Nah, I'm good.
She usually picks up.
I'm sure she's fine.
During his first spree, who gave the killer the most attention, Sam?
It was us.
It was you and me.
This whole time, I've had this feeling -- the killings in Chicago, now here Florida.
What if he's been watching us, knew I was in Florida, knows who I'm close to?
Callie?
No, it's me.
I checked stolen car reports like you asked.
Any with GPS?
Any at the hospital?
Unfortunately, yes.
Callie Cargill?
Have you seen her?
Not in the last hour or so.
Hey!
Stay back!
Get off!
Where's Callie?
!
Get off me!
Where is she?
!
You're not gonna pin this on me!
You couldn't before!
You can't now!
Get off me!
You got him?
You got him?
Go, go.
I got him.
Go.
Get down!
Stay down!
Callie?
Callie!
Callie?
Oh, my God!
Hey!
What the --
Oh, my God.
Jim, what's wrong?
Did you treat a guy for a dog bite earlier?
Yeah.
About 20 minutes ago, why?
Wait, is that the serial killer you guys are after?
I mean, the whole hospital is freaking out.
Jim...
Tommy Ray is in custody -- raving mad and still not cooperating, but, you know, at least he's off the street.
Callie, are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't even know I was in trouble.
All right, well...
Congratulations, Jim.
This one's a long time coming.
Come on.
I'm sure after all this time, it's probably pretty hard to believe it's all over.
Wh-- uh, yeah.
Thanks.
It is over, Jim.
Go and celebrate with that partner of yours.
You both have it coming to you.
Actually, I do need to check if she's all right.
Yeah, of course.
No, go.
Well, that's got to feel good, getting that monkey off your back.
I guess.
You guess?
It's time to celebrate, amigo.
You on your way back?
I'll buy you and Sam a drink.
Yeah, I got to file my report.
And I think Sam's got a slightly different celebration in mind.
Yeah.
I'm sure she does.
No.
She just wants to kick back and catch a few rays.
I told her I'd throw some spiny lobster on the grill.
She's on the first flight back to Chicago in the morning.
Which reminds me, uh, Sam was bugging me about that white substance we found in Doris Fowler's condo.
Results came back.
It's diatomaceous earth.
What's it?
It's used in pool filtration.
You startled me.
Hello, Detective Harper.
Shh.
But not your partner.
He -- he -- he just wanted to catch me.
Not like you, Detective Harper.
You knew what I was going through.
You knew what I saw when I -- when I looked at those women -- giving others the love and attention that i deserved.
But she wouldn't give it to me, would she?
No, not mom, not the great Doris Fowler.
She gave everything she had to others!
But you knew that, didn't you, Detective Harper?
You knew because, deep down, you are just like them, aren't you -- always thinking of someone else, somebody other than yourself...
Unlike your partner, who only thinks of himself.
Well, let's see how he feels about this, huh?
See how he feels when he sees what I have waiting for him.
Aah!
He showed up five weeks ago, said he was taking over the pool business from his cousin who just moved to Seattle.
No doubt we'll find his cousin rotting in the swamp.
It's too bad.
Kevin Fowler actually did a better job on my pool.
Hey, and thank God for that unsettled feeling of yours.
We are done now, right?
Uh, Jared Nolan committed credit-card fraud...
Mm-hmm.
...Tommy Ray Haynes flapping his gums in prison has him being investigated under a totally unrelated murder, and Kevin Fowler killed nine women, including my pool guy.
Three bad guys for the price of one, so, yeah.
Yeah, I'd say we're done.
She'll have some bruising, but it'll go away.
Still, you need to be checked out at a hospital, okay?
I'll go get the medics.
Much better.
Chalk this up to that really special way you have of getting under people's skin.
Hey, seemed he was a lot madder at you than he was at me.
Only thing he did to me was clean my pool.
His mom moving away at least allowed him to control his urges.
Then once he lost the opportunity to kill his mom, figured next best thing -- get us together for his last big hurrah.
Well, we were the only people that actually cared about him.
Which is either really sad or really twisted.
So...
Um...
We never had a chance to finish our conversation.
Yeah.
Well, you're leaving now, so...
I'm not, actually.
You're not leaving?
Well, I have to interview Fowler, do my debriefing ahead of his extradition.
See if I can link him to any other missing persons.
Why?
My sticking around isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
What?
Uh, no.
No, no.
Uh, why would it be?
I don't know.
It's -- just checking.

Show me.
It's him.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
He told me his name was Bob Wilson.
He paid cash every month for 2 1/2 years.
Till about six weeks ago, he just disappeared.
You run a credit check, grab a social, photo I.D.?
No.
You rented a house to a guy you never laid eyes on?
I rented a house to his 950 bucks a month.
That's not a crime, is it?
Hold this.
[ Beep ] Woman:
Hello.
This is a courtesy call for Bob Wilson.
Thank you for your recent visit to Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare here in sunny South Florida.
We look forward to seeing you soon for your complimentary, all-expenses-paid weekend at our fabulous four-star resort.
[ Beep ]
[ Cellphone ringing ]
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Hey.
Hi.
I just...wanted to call and say "hi."
"Hi" to you.
Jeff and Ray are doing yardwork.
Giving you a chance to call and say "hi."
How you doing?
We're good.
We're hanging in there.
[ Breathing heavily ] Super soaker?
Uh, hall -- hall.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you should, uh...
Yeah, I need to...go.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Ah.
Man:
Uh, it's none of my business, but I can see the pool hasn't been used much lately.
Uh, a friend's son used to come over and use it.
If I cut back to twice a month, you could probably save a few bucks.
Um...
Let me think about it?
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, I used to pay your cousin online.
Uh, yeah, I'm not really set up for that.
I'm not much of a computer guy.
Me neither.
All right, check it is.
Okay.
Oh, uh, y-you want a check now?
Why?
I haven't done anything, yet.
Nice place.
Yeah, it's, uh...
It's good to see you, too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
[ Sarcastically ] Hi.
How are you?
How's tricks?
Long time, no see.
Is that better?
Jim, he's back.
Are you sure it's him?
White female, 25 to 32, dirty-blond hair, blacked-out eyes.
Yeah, I'm sure.
And you're in my backyard...
Why?
Because I believe the Northside strangler is here in Florida.

[ Indistinct conversations ]
Manus:
The Northside strangler?
Between '05 and late 2008, he was linked with the abduction and murder of six women -- these two make eight.
Now eight.
I headed up the Chicago side of the task force with Detective Harper of the Illinois State Bureau for almost four years.
Until our unsub went dormant and our trail turned to ice.
A message from Sun 'n Lakes Timeshares was left on our suspect's phone three days ago.
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
What I found two days ago in Chicago is the first activity we've clocked in 2 1/2 years.
Okay, fine.
But what makes you -- or, rather, her -- think that the unsub is here?
Detective Harper seems to think that he's searching for a new hunting ground.
He's territorial -- six kills within the same 8 square miles, then stops -- imprisonment, maybe injury -- then kills again in the same zone with the same victimology and the same blacked-out eyes,
then bolts in the middle of the night to visit timeshares in Florida.
He's on the move, and my guess is he's gonna kill again soon.
She sounds pretty confident.
Yeah.
That's one word for it.
Okay, fine, but, uh, while she's here, she's your problem.
And that's another.
Thanks.
Thanks for your time.
Ah.
You must be Mr. and Mrs...
Uh, Longworth and Harper.
Detectives Longworth and Harper.
Oh.
I thought you were here for the promotion.
Maybe.
What are you offering?
Well, we have a fantastic offer.
By attending a one-day presentation, we are gifting a complimentary two days of tennis, golf, and fabulous food at our world-class facility.
Sounds good.
How many sales pitches do we have to sit through for that?
Well, they're not pitches, per se, but there are a series of guest meetings throughout the week.
Ah.
Now, did a Bob Wilson attend one of those "guest meetings"?
Maybe.
Uh, is there some trouble?
We believe he may have killed eight women.
A-a serial killer?
Yeah, who may have attended one of your presentations, so, uh, if we could loop back around to that question?
Yes.
We do have a Bob Wilson in our records.
And he was scheduled to attend two weeks ago, but he never showed up.
But he did attend this past weekend.
Can you describe him?
Uh, between the Sun 'n Lakes and, uh,
Citrus Estates locations, we have over 340 guests.
I notice a lot of your guests are wearing I.D. badges.
Can you give us a copy of Bob Wilson's?
We take I.D.s after lunch, and it looks like he left after the first session in the morning.
Didn't want his picture taken.
Any of your female guests not return after lunch?
All the women came back except a Margaret Palmer did not come back after the first day.
Meaning she sat through the presentation but didn't stick around for the cool free shit?
Do you have her picture?
You got an address for this Margaret Palmer?
She was just here on vacation, and she was staying at the Westin.
Fits the profile.
Man:
According to our records,
Margaret Palmer hasn't used her room card in two days.
When is she scheduled to check out?
She's booked through tomorrow.
I'll check the bedroom.
Thank you.
[ Beep ]
Margaret:
Who the fuck are you?
Oh.
Ms. Palmer?
Get out!
No, no, no, wait.
I'm Jim Longworth.
I'm FDLE.
Get out!
[ Grunting ] Watch it!
Watch it!
You're gonna...
Stun yourself.
I see you haven't lost your touch with the ladies.
If we'd dug a little deeper, we would have realized that other than a vague physical resemblance,
Margaret Palmer did not fit our victimology.
Yeah, she required the assistance of a walking cane.
He's never targeted the weak before.
Was there any forensic evidence that pulled it all together?
There was never any physical evidence, no DNA to link him to the victims.
Although there was ash from a cigarette found on every victim, so we assume our killer's a smoker.
Anything that linked the victims together?
Apart from Chicago and general physical similarities, nothing.
We have two school teachers, a speech therapist, a social worker...
A crossing guard, and three stay-at-home moms.
Hmm.
Not like any stay-at-home mom I've ever seen.
Oh, Crystal Benson was a stripper.
Worked a pole right in the middle of our kill zone.
Which begs the question -- was there any sexual assault?
No.
No sexual component.
Violence is sex for them.
It's at the heart of their urges.
Which is what we think is behind the weird blackening of the eyes thing.
Yeah, what's that about?
Sam:
Shame -- at who he is and what he's done.
So he can't look back at them.
Hmm.
3 1/2 years you guys lived in this guy's head -- that explains you.
But you?
[ Chuckles ]
You got lucky.
I did?
Awesome.
Yeah.
Margaret Palmer decided not to press charges.
Yeah, I wasn't even in the room, so...
Detective Harper, I like to asset share as much as the next lawman, but in case you haven't noticed, this is Florida, meaning we've got no shortage of deviants to track down.
So until or unless you can show me some evidence of your Northside strangler -- like, I don't know, a body --
I'm gonna need to take my bodies back.
I love her.
Seriously, she's awesome.
[ Horn honks ]
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, is this yours?
Will be in two years when I pay off the loan.
This is awesome.
Come on.
Jump inside.
Look at it.
All right.
Well, look at you, all official.
So, how did you...
Oh, uh, a buddy of mine.
Him and his wife kind of got knocked up, so...
Kind of got knocked up?
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
So, money was tight, and they let me take over the payments.
That's industrious.
Yeah, well, lets me hit the ground running, you know, be my own boss.
Oh, um, I t-took some money out of our joint account, just for, like, the first payment and gas and stuff like that.
I hope that's okay.
Yeah, of course.
No, that's your money, too.
Promise I'll have it back in there by the end of the week.
Really, it's not a problem.
Hey, can we take it for a ride?
Absolutely.
Let's go.
Load up.
All right.
Come on, mom.
There's room for you.
I should, uh, start on the laundry, but you guys have fun.
You really want these women staring back at you again?
Or not staring back.
I can't tell you how many times I've done this, stand there, staring at his victims.
Agonizing over what we could have overlooked.
So much of those 3 1/2 years just haunting me daily.
Really?
I haven't given it a second thought.
But then it was easier for me, not being around it when I left.
Yeah, you did sort of vanish into the night.
So how was it?
How was what?
The wedding.
It...wasn't.
I-I mean, I -- it -- it didn't -- didn't happen.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
They're my grandmother's.
Um, I always loved them, and, well, it tends to keep the wolves at bay.
Yeah, well, got to keep those wolves at bay.
I was so sure there was something that was bringing him here.
Well, it wouldn't be the first blind alley we've been down with him.
Two new victims after nearly four years?
Something's triggering his kills, Jimmy, something new.
A stressor we haven't seen before.
- Well, I'm sure you've kept tabs on, uh...
- Tommy Ray Haynes?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's doing 22 months for a felony elude to evade down in Joliet.
[ Chuckles ] He always did like to run.
And you always did like him for it.
Look, if I'm right and he's here, why Florida, Jimmy?
Why this timeshare?
I mean, every female guest is accounted for.
Am I that far off base, or are we just missing something?
Or someone.
The guests were accounted for, not the employees.
Daniel, I need you to do something.
Ashley Whitfield, 26, fits the profile.
Hasn't been to work in three days.
That's not a good sign.
Ashley Whitfield?
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
The neighbor didn't see anything, but she did notice Ashley's car was missing.
The killer's never taken a victim's car before.
Well, who needs a car in Chicago?
Just a pain in the ass trying to find a place to park.
But Florida...
Detectives, I ran down the source of that voicemail message from Bob Wilson's machine like you asked me to.
Oh, like you asked him to?
It wasn't actually from the timeshare company itself.
It was from a call center in New Delhi.
They called from a master list of everyone from Chicago who visited Florida in the last six months -- over 40,000 people.
Records indicate they left that message five weeks ago, but there's no real way to trace who actually placed the call to Bob Wilson.
All right, yeah.
Hi.
Probably just one of thousands anyway.
You know what?
Get us an APB on Ashley Whitfield's car.
Right away.
[ Chuckles ]
Now.
Okay.
Carlos:
I won't know till I get her on a table.
But based on the bruising on her neck and throat, and what feels like a hyperextension of the larynx, manual strangulation appears to be the cause of death.
I could be more conclusive if they hadn't blacked out her eyes.
You can tell so much by the eyes.
- They obviously spoke to our killer.
- Yeah, and not in a good way.
- Thanks, Carlos.
Let us know.
- You got it.
There's no evidence of cigarette ash like in all the other crime scenes.
Or that special smoker smell.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I went ahead and e-filed with the commissioner's office to inform them that you'll be working this case with Detective Longworth.
Just remember that while you're here, you're working under his badge and under Florida law.
Y-you said this guy kills two women within days of each other, right?
That's been his pattern.
A new stressor in his life triggers such a need to kill, he kills once, then he kills again...
Then guilt or remorse sets in, and he stops, each time after two.
If this new pattern is anything like the old one, my guess is he's already chosen his next victim.
So find this guy -- fast.
Look, we have a pretty good idea where he and Ashley's paths crossed.
- I'm thinking we start --
- Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare, right?
What?
Ashley's dead?
From this s-serial killer that you're after?
We think her death might be related to the series, yeah.
How well did you know Ashley?
Not very.
She did her thing with the guests.
I did mine.
We didn't have a lot of interaction.
Interaction?
Well, did you see her interacting an unusual amount with anyone -- guests, co-worker, maybe?
Not really.
And we weren't co-workers in the traditional sense.
What does that mean?
She taught water aerobics to our guests, but she did that at a lot of places -- hotels, health clubs,
55-and-older planned communities.
Oh.
How's that going?
Pardon?
Nicorette.
I remember when I quit, the cravings just about drove me nuts.
Cancer sticks, yeah.
Uh, thank you, big tobacco.
Listen, it's terrible what happened to Ashley, and if there's anything that I can do, you let me know.
Sure.
- You never smoked.
- Not on purpose.
But he's definitely trying to quit.
In every other crime scene, there was physical evidence that our killer was a smoker, but not in Ashley's apartment.
Maybe our killer is trying to quit.
Not enough to bring him in but certainly enough to dig deeper.
And now that we've confirmed a victim in Florida, it's time to cross-check our list of persons of interest, see if anybody's migrated to the sunshine state.
Yeah.
Daniel.
Hey, I need you --
Hey.
Daniel, yeah.
No, it's me.
Listen, can you do a teensie-weensie little something for me?
"Teensie-weensie"?
[ ATM beeping ] What?
You said a little money, Ray.
Mrs. Cargill.
Oh, hey.
Uh, please, it's Callie.
Is everything all right?
Uh, no.
No.
Not even close.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, you know, seriously, I can handle the workload and the hours and juggling everyone else's schedule including my own, but when I can't get enough cash out of the machine to get a double half cap with splenda, then, you know...
Okay, so, uh...
[Chuckling] It's not that bad.
It's just some days I feel like I can't get ahead.
Amen to that.
Callie, you know, your family matters aside for the moment,
I've seen you at the office...
Oh, Jim.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
Not Jim.
Carlos, actually.
Carlos?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, Carlos is great.
He's actually helping me connect the dots between medical text books and, you know, what happens in the real world.
Exactly.
Let me make a few phone calls.
Calls?
Yeah.
You know, I -
- I might have an idea
I think could work for both of us.
Would you swing by the office tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Sure.
It's official.
Cause of death is manual strangulation.
Trace evidence of chloroform in throat and lungs.
Like the others.
The chloroform is how he disables his victims so he can do that weird dye thing to their eyes.
There's nothing unusual about the dye itself.
It's food coloring, like the kind you get at any grocery store.
Looks like it's your Northside strangler, all right.
Which, by the way, the moniker as it is -- a little lazy.
Hey, that's not on us.
The Tribune coined that expression.
Besides, we didn't want to stoke the guy's fire by giving him a cool, sexy name he felt he had to live up to.
You think he cared what you called him?
Oh, I think he followed our moves and our investigation very carefully.
Detective, that list of persons of interest you asked me to check on -- they're all accounted for in Illinois.
But the guy you thought is in a Joliet State Prison...
Tommy Ray Haynes.
He was released from prison two months ago.
What?
!
That's enough time to do the Chicago killings.
Damn it.
I checked on him earlier in the year.
They told me he had seven months left.
Overcrowding changed that.
I need you to check with the Illinois parole board, his parole officer -- get us a last known.
Director Manus already did that.
He listed his sister's address in Calumet City, but he never showed up.
And according to DMV records,
Tommy Ray Haynes has a cousin who lives here, in Homestead.
Manus:
You're calling from a bar?
Tommy Ray's not staying with his cousin because his cousin's wife hates him.
But he's in a white '96 Ford pickup that his cousin lent him, and we're at his cousin's bar.
Worst case -- he doesn't turn up.
We grab a beer.
Goodbye.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
All right, if you promise not to gloat,
I will admit that finding a victim and Tommy Ray in the same state, is a little more than a coincidence.
See?
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Actually, it was harder than it looked.
Fits the classic profile, Jimmy.
25 to 36 years old, white male, abandoned as a child, in and out of foster care his whole life.
I mean, guys like that, true sociopaths, have no real connection to anyone or anything.
Everything about Tommy Ray Haynes fits the profile -- of Tommy Ray Haynes.
Seriously?
Oh, my God.
You will not give up.
I'm just saying there's too much at stake to throw all our eggs into Tommy Ray's basket.
[ Sighs ]
Jim...
Look, despite what you may think,
I am truly sorry about what happened.
Hey, look, it's all in the past.
Just working together so closely, day and night, on an emotionally charged case, you know, things happen.
They did, yeah.
A bunch of times.
You knew what it was.
I didn't, actually.
I mean, I figured it out after three months when you told me you were engaged.
Then I realized exactly what it was.
Obviously, I was confused.
Yeah, look, and, hey -- it all worked out for the best, right?
And, actually, I've met someone down here.
- Really?
- Really...
If not a tad unavailable at the moment.
No pattern there.
You know, I asked around your precinct.
Even after the incident with your captain, you could have stayed in your department.
Why didn't you?
Oh, you know.
I...
I got the invitation to your wedding, just figured... needed a change of scenery.
So what happened?
I mean, cold feet?
Find him with his secretary?
Richard was a good man.
I thought he was the love of my life, but I was wrong.
[ Vehicle approaches ]
That's him.
Tommy Ray Haynes.
Go, go, go!
Cut him off!
[ Grunts ]
[ Dogs barking ]
Aah!
Down!
Get -- ow!
Down!
Get off!
[ Dog snarling, barking ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
You need any more convincing?
Hey, I put out a BOLO and sent a unit to his cousin's house.
Yeah, we impounded his pickup.
So at least for the moment, he's on foot.
We need to get Tommy Ray's photo out to every taxi and bus driver in the county.
Already did, and any reports of stolen vehicles will be sent directly to me immediately.
[ Cellphone rings ] Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah.
Let me see.
No.
It's fine.
Let me see.
See?
There are some advantages about being thick-skinned.
Didn't break the surface.
Still, you should probably get it looked at.
- You had a tetanus shot lately?
- Yeah, about a year ago.
What bit you then?
Or should I say "who"?
An alligator.
Well, caiman, actually.
They found Ashley Whitfield's car.
[ Indistinct conversation ]
[ Laughs ]
Here we go.
What here we go?
The way you look at Detective Harper.
I wasn't looking at her any way.
Only one other woman I've ever seen you look at like that, my friend.
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're wrong.
- I'm not.
Sam:
The service guy says Ashley dropped her car off four days ago, never came back to pick it up.
I showed him a picture of Tommy Ray Haynes, but he's never met him.
So much for the theory that the killer took her car.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean he was never in it.
- What do you got?
- Gum.
Smoker's gum?
Like the kind that helps you quit.
Yeah.
Ashley Whitfield was not a smoker.
And if Tommy Ray Haynes is trying to quit, he's doing a terrible job.
He stunk of nicotine when I fought him.
But we do know someone in the mix who is trying to quit.
And who obviously lied about his relationship with Ashley.
Even if the gum was mine, it doesn't prove that I killed Ashley.
Well, it proves you're a liar who had something to hide about a murdered woman.
That sort of usually goes hand in hand with the person that killed her.
I am not lying.
Ashley and I barely knew each other.
She gave me a ride once.
It was no big deal.
I'm not just talking about the gum, Jared.
We did our homework on you.
Well, actually, an enthusiastic paid intern did his homework on you.
The timeshare company that you work for, Sun 'n Lakes?
Yeah, they have a corporate headquarters in Elk Grove Village, a suburb of Chicago.
Okay.
So?
So, you've been with them for around six years, starting in about 2005.
That's the exact same time that the killings began.
But I don't live in Chicago.
I live here.
But for the first three years, you worked out of corporate headquarters.
And since then, you've been flying back and forth from here to Chicago.
Plenty of enough time to rev up, plan, and execute the murders.
I am telling you you got it all wrong.
I don't know anything about Ashley's murder, and I damn sure never killed anybody in Chicago.
We can put you with the victim, we can put you in Chicago at the exact time of each of the murders, and thanks to that intern I was talking about, who hooked up with FDLE fraud division,
we know that you may or may not be Jared Nolan.
So the question is, who the hell are you?
Terry McCabe, maybe?
Or Chad Crandall.
Chad -- really?
[ Scoffs ] That's just -- let me just go over here and find Bob Wilson so we can arrest you on the murders of two, maybe three --
I'm hoping all nine women.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
Fine.
[ Sighs ]
I'd been using my job to get credit-card information and selling it, but that is all.
And Jared Nolan is my real name.
Credit-card fraud, Jared?
Or maybe just aliases to hide your day job as a serial killer.
Red flags went up at corporate.
I needed another source.
Ashley was an aerobics instructor at Saw Grass Village, where her grandmother lived.
Saw Grass Village?
What?
A 55-and-older master-planned community.
Most of the units are filled with retired snowbirds from the Midwest.
Sue me.
Old people make soft targets --
You and Ashley worked this scam together?
No.
She never knew about it.
Ashley and I hooked up a couple of times.
I stole her password, I got the information from her computer.
She made friends with a lot of the older women, even after her grandmother died.
And Ashley being such a soft target, well, that was just too good to pass up, huh?
I really appreciate you thinking of me for this.
I mean, I've heard of forensic nursing.
I just never really saw myself pursuing it.
So think about it.
Look, the money's good, and the hours are flexible.
You wouldn't have to change jobs or quit going to med school.
You know, really, what it does is it lets you set the pace that works with your lifestyle and your crazy schedule.
- Director Manus.
- Yeah.
Oh, um, Callie, this is Detective Sam Harper.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be new.
I haven't seen you around.
Oh, I-I'm not from here.
I'm from Chicago.
Oh.
Jim's from Chicago.
Jim and I were partners on the Northside strangler case.
Ah.
He's amazing.
Yeah.
You got another suspect?
Person of interest.
We'll see if he graduates to suspect.
Okay.
Well, keep me in the loop on that.
Definitely.
Oh, uh, Callie.
Sam, this is Callie.
This is --
We've, uh -- We've met already.
Okay.
Oh.
Good.
Good.
Nice job in there, by the way.
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly a confession but definitely enough to hold him on, at least until we check out Saw Grass Village, where Ashley's grandmother lived.
Her grandmother?
I have a hunch.
Which we should probably check out, so, um, I-I'll see you later?
Actually, do you have a minute?
Oh, I'll -
- I'll -- I'll wait for you in the car.
I'll walk you out.
Sure.
Okay.
So, that's your old partner?
Unofficially.
Uh, actually, she was state.
I was Chicago local.
You two were together, weren't you?
I mean, Jim, I can tell.
For a while.
And now she's here?
For a while, Cal.
It's not a problem.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah. 18 months -- a lifetime ago, right?
She means nothing to me.
But clearly she did.
I get that we have people in our past.
It's just you never bothered to mention her to me?
Well...
[ Scoffs ]
Look, no.
You're right.
You're right.
I -- right, I probably should have.
But Sam lives Chicago.
I live here.
The sooner we catch this guy, the sooner she goes home.
I really got to go.
Yeah.
Go.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
No, I'm not eliminating Jared as a suspect.
I'm saying, if Ashley spent time here, maybe our killer did, too.
This is a 55-and-older community.
Ashley's grandmother was in her 70s.
That's a decade outside of our killer's target victimology.
Yeah, but not a 26-year-old granddaughter.
She made friends with her grandmother's pals.
Maybe one of those pals meant something to the killer.
[ Scoffs ]
Hey, I said it was a hunch.
You were the one that said he was looking for a new hunting ground.
I did say that, didn't I?
Yeah.
Hey, so, uh, Callie's pretty hot.
It's -- you never mentioned who, just that you'd met someone.
Can we...
Oh, fine.
Jared Nolan stole identities.
Maybe he stole "Bob Wilson,"
rented himself a house in Chicago, didn't realize that the name had been recycled back through the system.
But Jared Nolan isn't running.
Tommy Ray is.
Yeah, the Northside killer was never about outrunning us.
He was about outsmarting us.
Or trying to.
There.
You see?
A hunch.
[ Sighs ]
Tragic what happened to Ashley.
Such a sweet girl, always helping out.
But not to speak ill of the departed, but she and her grandma were the only ones that could handle Doris.
Northside Braille Institute.
Gulf Coast School for the Blind.
Southeast Services for the Blind.
Doris was devoted to helping the blind.
Not exactly the warmest person.
Blind devotion?
Try obsession.
Try I think we found it.
Found what?
The stressor we never saw before, the reason he's been killing.
Off the top of my head?
I'm going with mom.
Jim:
What do you got?
Not sure.
I'm thinking flour, like for baking.
As in that evidence you're about to eat --
Yep.
Six weeks stale.
Just confirming it.
I'll run this to the lab.
So, what does all this mean?
It means our previous assumptions about why he blacked out the victims' eyes is wrong.
It wasn't shame.
It was anger.
At blind people?
At his mother's devotion for the blind -- love she showed them, but not him.
Doris Fowler died in a hospice, completely alone.
No one ever came to visit her.
No one claimed the body.
Ashley made all the arrangements.
Hmm, all these people she gave her life to, and no one even cared to come see her?
She didn't give a rat's ass about them.
She gave a rat's ass about this -- look at me, how amazing I am.
"Giving" of myself.
Not even her own family?
Well, she only had one son -- Kevin Fowler.
Estranged, apparently.
Management's never met him or spoken to him, and there's no record of him ever visiting his mother.
Yeah, in my experience, serial killers don't sign the guest book.
So, Doris Fowler moves from Chicago.
His anger dissipates.
The killings stop.
She's diagnosed with cancer, forcing contact.
The pressure builds up again.
Six weeks later, she dies.
And the killings resume -- twin Chicago, and now here.
Which tells us what?
It tells us the pain of being denied his mother's attention was so profound, his anger so intense that he wanted to kill her.
But he couldn't.
So he kills surrogates.
First one, then another.
Women that triggered the rage he had for his mother, until he worked up the nerve to kill her.
But she gets diagnosed with cancer, triggers the need to kill again.
And then dies, the selfish bitch, robbing him of the chance of killing her and ending his agony.
So he kills Ashley Whitfield.
The question now is, who the hell is Kevin Fowler?
We know Jared nolan used identities.
Well, Doris Fowler was devoted to helping others.
Maybe she took in foster children just to add another notch to her belt.
Tommy Ray Haynes was in and out of foster care.
There you go.
Try that.
Uh, what's going on in here?
Dad's showing me how to make his famous three-cheese lasagna.
His three-cheese lasagna.
I haven't had that in a while.
I saw that you put the money in the account ahead of schedule.
Yeah, a couple good nights.
Look, this is gonna be ready in an hour.
If you want to grab a beer and go sit out on the porch.
I'd love to, but, um, I picked up a shift.
So...
Okay.
Well, then, uh, we'll save you a plate, and you can nuke it when you get home.
Okay.
And Tommy Ray Haynes bounced in and out of the foster care system his whole life, and Doris Fowler did take in foster children in Illinois.
You do know how long it'll take to unseal Tommy Ray's juvie record, right?
Try weeks.
No.
We don't have weeks.
Another body will probably turn up in the next couple of days, if not sooner.
All right, look, I'll reach out to a judge buddy of mine, see if I can expedite that.
Thank you.
This is what we never had before -- the rage he had for his mother.
He's been killing nurturers and caregivers, women he wanted his mother to be.
Why didn't I see this before?
Because we could never connect the victims to a single victimology -- I mean, we've got moms, career women, women who volunteered --
All with nurturing qualities, love and attention they gave to other people.
But not Crystal Benson.
The stripper.
Crystal had no children.
She was in and out of prison, drug rehab.
She could barely take care of herself.
She doesn't fit the profile, which, of course, as we all know, if one thing doesn't fit...
Then none of it fits, and you have nothing.
Or does she?
Okay, you really need to have that looked at.
No, no, no.
There's no time.
It's not what we see that made them victims.
It's what he saw and probably, no doubt, the thing that he sees in his next victim.
I mean, we've got three stay-at-home moms, two educators, a social worker.
He's obviously targeting them for their nurturing quality -- love and attention that they gave to others -- including Crystal.
I don't know, Jim.
The stripper's a stretch.
Her stage name -- Florence Nightingale.
A nurse.
It's probably nothing, but you never want to take your chances with a dog bite.
That wasn't that bad, was it?
Nah, I'm good.
She usually picks up.
I'm sure she's fine.
During his first spree, who gave the killer the most attention, Sam?
It was us.
It was you and me.
This whole time, I've had this feeling -- the killings in Chicago, now here Florida.
What if he's been watching us, knew I was in Florida, knows who I'm close to?
[ Cellphone ringing ] Callie?
No, it's me.
I checked stolen car reports like you asked.
Any with GPS?
Any at the hospital?
Unfortunately, yes.
[ Tires screech ]
Callie Cargill?
Have you seen her?
Not in the last hour or so.
[ Indistinct shouting ]
[ Gasps ]
Man:
Hey!
Stay back!
[ Indistinct shouting ]
[ Gasping ]
Get off!
Where's Callie?
!
Get off me!
Where is she?
!
You're not gonna pin this on me!
You couldn't before!
You can't now!
Get off me!
You got him?
You got him?
Go, go.
I got him.
Go.
Get down!
Stay down!
[ Gun cocks ]
Callie?
Callie!
Callie?
Oh, my God!
Hey!
What the --
Oh, my God.
Jim, what's wrong?
Did you treat a guy for a dog bite earlier?
Yeah.
About 20 minutes ago, why?
Wait, is that the serial killer you guys are after?
I mean, the whole hospital is freaking out.
Jim...
Tommy Ray is in custody -- raving mad and still not cooperating, but, you know, at least he's off the street.
Callie, are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't even know I was in trouble.
All right, well...
Congratulations, Jim.
This one's a long time coming.
[ Sighs ] Come on.
I'm sure after all this time, it's probably pretty hard to believe it's all over.
Wh-- uh, yeah.
Thanks.
It is over, Jim.
Go and celebrate with that partner of yours.
You both have it coming to you.
Actually, I do need to check if she's all right.
Yeah, of course.
No, go.
Carlos:
Well, that's got to feel good, getting that monkey off your back.
I guess.
You guess?
It's time to celebrate, amigo.
[ Laughs ]
You on your way back?
I'll buy you and Sam a drink.
Yeah, I got to file my report.
And I think Sam's got a slightly different celebration in mind.
Yeah.
I'm sure she does.
No.
She just wants to kick back and catch a few rays.
I told her I'd throw some spiny lobster on the grill.
She's on the first flight back to Chicago in the morning.
Which reminds me, uh, Sam was bugging me about that white substance we found in Doris Fowler's condo.
Results came back.
It's diatomaceous earth.
What's it?
It's used in pool filtration.
[ Siren walls ]
[ Sighs ]
You startled me.
Hello, Detective Harper.
[ Grunting ] Shh.
[ Echoing ] But not your partner.
He -- he -- he just wanted to catch me.
[ Normal voice ] Not like you, Detective Harper.
You knew what I was going through.
You knew what I saw when I -- when I looked at those women -- giving others the love and attention that i deserved.
But she wouldn't give it to me, would she?
No, not mom, not the great Doris Fowler.
She gave everything she had to others!
But you knew that, didn't you, Detective Harper?
You knew because, deep down, you are just like them, aren't you -- always thinking of someone else, somebody other than yourself...
Unlike your partner, who only thinks of himself.
[ Gasping ]
Well, let's see how he feels about this, huh?
See how he feels when he sees what I have waiting for him.
[ Gunshot ] Aah!
[ Grunting ]
[ Sirens wail ]
He showed up five weeks ago, said he was taking over the pool business from his cousin who just moved to Seattle.
No doubt we'll find his cousin rotting in the swamp.
It's too bad.
Kevin Fowler actually did a better job on my pool.
[ Chuckles ]
Hey, and thank God for that unsettled feeling of yours.
We are done now, right?
Uh, Jared Nolan committed credit-card fraud...
Mm-hmm.
...Tommy Ray Haynes flapping his gums in prison has him being investigated under a totally unrelated murder, and Kevin Fowler killed nine women, including my pool guy.
Three bad guys for the price of one, so, yeah.
Yeah, I'd say we're done.
Carlos:
She'll have some bruising, but it'll go away.
Still, you need to be checked out at a hospital, okay?
I'll go get the medics.
Much better.
Chalk this up to that really special way you have of getting under people's skin.
Hey, seemed he was a lot madder at you than he was at me.
Only thing he did to me was clean my pool.
His mom moving away at least allowed him to control his urges.
Then once he lost the opportunity to kill his mom, figured next best thing -- get us together for his last big hurrah.
Well, we were the only people that actually cared about him.
Which is either really sad or really twisted.
So...
Um...
We never had a chance to finish our conversation.
Yeah.
Well, you're leaving now, so...
I'm not, actually.
You're not leaving?
Well, I have to interview Fowler, do my debriefing ahead of his extradition.
See if I can link him to any other missing persons.
Why?
My sticking around isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
What?
Uh, no.
No, no.
Uh, why would it be?
I don't know.
It's -- just checking.

Show me.
It's him.
He told me his name was Bob Wilson.
He paid cash every month for 2 1/2 years.
Till about six weeks ago, he just disappeared.
You run a credit check, grab a social, photo I.D.?
No.
You rented a house to a guy you never laid eyes on?
I rented a house to his 950 bucks a month.
That's not a crime, is it?
Hold this.
Hello.
This is a courtesy call for Bob Wilson.
Thank you for your recent visit to Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare here in sunny South Florida.
We look forward to seeing you soon for your complimentary, all-expenses-paid weekend at our fabulous four-star resort.
Hey.
Hi.
I just...wanted to call and say "hi."
"Hi" to you.
Jeff and Ray are doing yardwork.
Giving you a chance to call and say "hi."
How you doing?
We're good.
We're hanging in there.
Super soaker?
Uh, hall -- hall.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you should, uh...
Yeah, I need to...go.
Ah.
Uh, it's none of my business, but I can see the pool hasn't been used much lately.
Uh, a friend's son used to come over and use it.
If I cut back to twice a month, you could probably save a few bucks.
Um...
Let me think about it?
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, I used to pay your cousin online.
Uh, yeah, I'm not really set up for that.
I'm not much of a computer guy.
Me neither.
All right, check it is.
Okay.
Oh, uh, y-you want a check now?
Why?
I haven't done anything, yet.
Nice place.
Yeah, it's, uh...
It's good to see you, too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
How are you?
How's tricks?
Long time, no see.
Is that better?
Jim, he's back.
Are you sure it's him?
White female, 25 to 32, dirty-blond hair, blacked-out eyes.
Yeah, I'm sure.
And you're in my backyard...
Why?
Because I believe the Northside strangler is here in Florida.
♪ The Glades 2x02 ♪ Old Ghosts Original Air Date on June 12, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The Northside strangler?
Between '05 and late 2008, he was linked with the abduction and murder of six women -- these two make eight.
Now eight.
I headed up the Chicago side of the task force with Detective Harper of the Illinois State Bureau for almost four years.
Until our unsub went dormant and our trail turned to ice.
A message from Sun 'n Lakes Timeshares was left on our suspect's phone three days ago.
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
What I found two days ago in Chicago is the first activity we've clocked in 2 1/2 years.
Okay, fine.
But what makes you -- or, rather, her -- think that the unsub is here?
Detective Harper seems to think that he's searching for a new hunting ground.
He's territorial -- six kills within the same 8 square miles, then stops -- imprisonment, maybe injury -- then kills again in the same zone with the same victimology and the same blacked-out eyes,
then bolts in the middle of the night to visit timeshares in Florida.
He's on the move, and my guess is he's gonna kill again soon.
She sounds pretty confident.
Yeah.
That's one word for it.
Okay, fine, but, uh, while she's here, she's your problem.
And that's another.
Thanks.
Thanks for your time.
Ah.
You must be Mr. and Mrs...
Uh, Longworth and Harper.
Detectives Longworth and Harper.
Oh.
I thought you were here for the promotion.
Maybe.
What are you offering?
Well, we have a fantastic offer.
By attending a one-day presentation, we are gifting a complimentary two days of tennis, golf, and fabulous food at our world-class facility.
Sounds good.
How many sales pitches do we have to sit through for that?
Well, they're not pitches, per se, but there are a series of guest meetings throughout the week.
Ah.
Now, did a Bob Wilson attend one of those "guest meetings"?
Maybe.
Uh, is there some trouble?
We believe he may have killed eight women.
A-a serial killer?
Yeah, who may have attended one of your presentations, so, uh, if we could loop back around to that question?
Yes.
We do have a Bob Wilson in our records.
And he was scheduled to attend two weeks ago, but he never showed up.
But he did attend this past weekend.
Can you describe him?
Uh, between the Sun 'n Lakes and, uh,
Citrus Estates locations, we have over 340 guests.
I notice a lot of your guests are wearing I.D. badges.
Can you give us a copy of Bob Wilson's?
We take I.D.s after lunch, and it looks like he left after the first session in the morning.
Didn't want his picture taken.
Any of your female guests not return after lunch?
All the women came back except a Margaret Palmer did not come back after the first day.
Meaning she sat through the presentation but didn't stick around for the cool free shit?
Do you have her picture?
You got an address for this Margaret Palmer?
She was just here on vacation, and she was staying at the Westin.
Fits the profile.
According to our records,
Margaret Palmer hasn't used her room card in two days.
When is she scheduled to check out?
She's booked through tomorrow.
I'll check the bedroom.
Thank you.
Who the fuck are you?
Oh.
Ms. Palmer?
Get out!
No, no, no, wait.
I'm Jim Longworth.
I'm FDLE.
Get out!
Watch it!
Watch it!
You're gonna...
Stun yourself.
I see you haven't lost your touch with the ladies.
If we'd dug a little deeper, we would have realized that other than a vague physical resemblance,
Margaret Palmer did not fit our victimology.
Yeah, she required the assistance of a walking cane.
He's never targeted the weak before.
Was there any forensic evidence that pulled it all together?
There was never any physical evidence, no DNA to link him to the victims.
Although there was ash from a cigarette found on every victim, so we assume our killer's a smoker.
Anything that linked the victims together?
Apart from Chicago and general physical similarities, nothing.
We have two school teachers, a speech therapist, a social worker...
A crossing guard, and three stay-at-home moms.
Hmm.
Not like any stay-at-home mom I've ever seen.
Oh, Crystal Benson was a stripper.
Worked a pole right in the middle of our kill zone.
Which begs the question -- was there any sexual assault?
No.
No sexual component.
Violence is sex for them.
It's at the heart of their urges.
Which is what we think is behind the weird blackening of the eyes thing.
Yeah, what's that about?
Shame -- at who he is and what he's done.
So he can't look back at them.
Hmm.
3 1/2 years you guys lived in this guy's head -- that explains you.
But you?
You got lucky.
I did?
Awesome.
Yeah.
Margaret Palmer decided not to press charges.
Yeah, I wasn't even in the room, so...
Detective Harper, I like to asset share as much as the next lawman, but in case you haven't noticed, this is Florida, meaning we've got no shortage of deviants to track down.
So until or unless you can show me some evidence of your Northside strangler -- like, I don't know, a body --
I'm gonna need to take my bodies back.
I love her.
Seriously, she's awesome.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, is this yours?
Will be in two years when I pay off the loan.
This is awesome.
Come on.
Jump inside.
Look at it.
All right.
Well, look at you, all official.
So, how did you...
Oh, uh, a buddy of mine.
Him and his wife kind of got knocked up, so...
Kind of got knocked up?
Yeah.
So, money was tight, and they let me take over the payments.
That's industrious.
Yeah, well, lets me hit the ground running, you know, be my own boss.
Oh, um, I t-took some money out of our joint account, just for, like, the first payment and gas and stuff like that.
I hope that's okay.
Yeah, of course.
No, that's your money, too.
Promise I'll have it back in there by the end of the week.
Really, it's not a problem.
Hey, can we take it for a ride?
Absolutely.
Let's go.
Load up.
All right.
Come on, mom.
There's room for you.
I should, uh, start on the laundry, but you guys have fun.
You really want these women staring back at you again?
Or not staring back.
I can't tell you how many times I've done this, stand there, staring at his victims.
Agonizing over what we could have overlooked.
So much of those 3 1/2 years just haunting me daily.
Really?
I haven't given it a second thought.
But then it was easier for me, not being around it when I left.
Yeah, you did sort of vanish into the night.
So how was it?
How was what?
The wedding.
It...wasn't.
I-I mean, I -- it -- it didn't -- didn't happen.
Oh.
They're my grandmother's.
Um, I always loved them, and, well, it tends to keep the wolves at bay.
Yeah, well, got to keep those wolves at bay.
I was so sure there was something that was bringing him here.
Well, it wouldn't be the first blind alley we've been down with him.
Two new victims after nearly four years?
Something's triggering his kills, Jimmy, something new.
A stressor we haven't seen before.
- Well, I'm sure you've kept tabs on, uh...
- Tommy Ray Haynes?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's doing 22 months for a felony elude to evade down in Joliet.
He always did like to run.
And you always did like him for it.
Look, if I'm right and he's here, why Florida, Jimmy?
Why this timeshare?
I mean, every female guest is accounted for.
Am I that far off base, or are we just missing something?
Or someone.
The guests were accounted for, not the employees.
Daniel, I need you to do something.
Ashley Whitfield, 26, fits the profile.
Hasn't been to work in three days.
That's not a good sign.
Ashley Whitfield?
The neighbor didn't see anything, but she did notice Ashley's car was missing.
The killer's never taken a victim's car before.
Well, who needs a car in Chicago?
Just a pain in the ass trying to find a place to park.
But Florida...
Detectives, I ran down the source of that voicemail message from Bob Wilson's machine like you asked me to.
Oh, like you asked him to?
It wasn't actually from the timeshare company itself.
It was from a call center in New Delhi.
They called from a master list of everyone from Chicago who visited Florida in the last six months -- over 40,000 people.
Records indicate they left that message five weeks ago, but there's no real way to trace who actually placed the call to Bob Wilson.
All right, yeah.
Hi.
Probably just one of thousands anyway.
You know what?
Get us an APB on Ashley Whitfield's car.
Right away.
Now.
Okay.
I won't know till I get her on a table.
But based on the bruising on her neck and throat, and what feels like a hyperextension of the larynx, manual strangulation appears to be the cause of death.
I could be more conclusive if they hadn't blacked out her eyes.
You can tell so much by the eyes.
- They obviously spoke to our killer.
- Yeah, and not in a good way.
- Thanks, Carlos.
Let us know.
- You got it.
There's no evidence of cigarette ash like in all the other crime scenes.
Or that special smoker smell.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I went ahead and e-filed with the commissioner's office to inform them that you'll be working this case with Detective Longworth.
Just remember that while you're here, you're working under his badge and under Florida law.
Y-you said this guy kills two women within days of each other, right?
That's been his pattern.
A new stressor in his life triggers such a need to kill, he kills once, then he kills again...
Then guilt or remorse sets in, and he stops, each time after two.
If this new pattern is anything like the old one, my guess is he's already chosen his next victim.
So find this guy -- fast.
Look, we have a pretty good idea where he and Ashley's paths crossed.
- I'm thinking we start --
- Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare, right?
What?
Ashley's dead?
From this s-serial killer that you're after?
We think her death might be related to the series, yeah.
How well did you know Ashley?
Not very.
She did her thing with the guests.
I did mine.
We didn't have a lot of interaction.
Interaction?
Well, did you see her interacting an unusual amount with anyone -- guests, co-worker, maybe?
Not really.
And we weren't co-workers in the traditional sense.
What does that mean?
She taught water aerobics to our guests, but she did that at a lot of places -- hotels, health clubs,
55-and-older planned communities.
Oh.
How's that going?
Pardon?
Nicorette.
I remember when I quit, the cravings just about drove me nuts.
Cancer sticks, yeah.
Uh, thank you, big tobacco.
Listen, it's terrible what happened to Ashley, and if there's anything that I can do, you let me know.
Sure.
- You never smoked.
- Not on purpose.
But he's definitely trying to quit.
In every other crime scene, there was physical evidence that our killer was a smoker, but not in Ashley's apartment.
Maybe our killer is trying to quit.
Not enough to bring him in but certainly enough to dig deeper.
And now that we've confirmed a victim in Florida, it's time to cross-check our list of persons of interest, see if anybody's migrated to the sunshine state.
Yeah.
Daniel.
Hey, I need you --
Hey.
Daniel, yeah.
No, it's me.
Listen, can you do a teensie-weensie little something for me?
"Teensie-weensie"?
What?
You said a little money, Ray.
Mrs. Cargill.
Oh, hey.
Uh, please, it's Callie.
Is everything all right?
Uh, no.
No.
Not even close.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, you know, seriously, I can handle the workload and the hours and juggling everyone else's schedule including my own, but when I can't get enough cash out of the machine to get a double half cap with splenda, then, you know...
Okay, so, uh...
It's not that bad.
It's just some days I feel like I can't get ahead.
Amen to that.
Callie, you know, your family matters aside for the moment,
I've seen you at the office...
Oh, Jim.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
Not Jim.
Carlos, actually.
Carlos?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, Carlos is great.
He's actually helping me connect the dots between medical text books and, you know, what happens in the real world.
Exactly.
Let me make a few phone calls.
Calls?
Yeah.
You know, I -
- I might have an idea
I think could work for both of us.
Would you swing by the office tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Sure.
It's official.
Cause of death is manual strangulation.
Trace evidence of chloroform in throat and lungs.
Like the others.
The chloroform is how he disables his victims so he can do that weird dye thing to their eyes.
There's nothing unusual about the dye itself.
It's food coloring, like the kind you get at any grocery store.
Looks like it's your Northside strangler, all right.
Which, by the way, the moniker as it is -- a little lazy.
Hey, that's not on us.
The Tribune coined that expression.
Besides, we didn't want to stoke the guy's fire by giving him a cool, sexy name he felt he had to live up to.
You think he cared what you called him?
Oh, I think he followed our moves and our investigation very carefully.
Detective, that list of persons of interest you asked me to check on -- they're all accounted for in Illinois.
But the guy you thought is in a Joliet State Prison...
Tommy Ray Haynes.
He was released from prison two months ago.
What?
!
That's enough time to do the Chicago killings.
Damn it.
I checked on him earlier in the year.
They told me he had seven months left.
Overcrowding changed that.
I need you to check with the Illinois parole board, his parole officer -- get us a last known.
Director Manus already did that.
He listed his sister's address in Calumet City, but he never showed up.
And according to DMV records,
Tommy Ray Haynes has a cousin who lives here, in Homestead.
You're calling from a bar?
Tommy Ray's not staying with his cousin because his cousin's wife hates him.
But he's in a white '96 Ford pickup that his cousin lent him, and we're at his cousin's bar.
Worst case -- he doesn't turn up.
We grab a beer.
Goodbye.
All right, if you promise not to gloat,
I will admit that finding a victim and Tommy Ray in the same state, is a little more than a coincidence.
See?
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Actually, it was harder than it looked.
Fits the classic profile, Jimmy.
25 to 36 years old, white male, abandoned as a child, in and out of foster care his whole life.
I mean, guys like that, true sociopaths, have no real connection to anyone or anything.
Everything about Tommy Ray Haynes fits the profile -- of Tommy Ray Haynes.
Seriously?
Oh, my God.
You will not give up.
I'm just saying there's too much at stake to throw all our eggs into Tommy Ray's basket.
Jim...
Look, despite what you may think,
I am truly sorry about what happened.
Hey, look, it's all in the past.
Just working together so closely, day and night, on an emotionally charged case, you know, things happen.
They did, yeah.
A bunch of times.
You knew what it was.
I didn't, actually.
I mean, I figured it out after three months when you told me you were engaged.
Then I realized exactly what it was.
Obviously, I was confused.
Yeah, look, and, hey -- it all worked out for the best, right?
And, actually, I've met someone down here.
- Really?
- Really...
If not a tad unavailable at the moment.
No pattern there.
You know, I asked around your precinct.
Even after the incident with your captain, you could have stayed in your department.
Why didn't you?
Oh, you know.
I...
I got the invitation to your wedding, just figured... needed a change of scenery.
So what happened?
I mean, cold feet?
Find him with his secretary?
Richard was a good man.
I thought he was the love of my life, but I was wrong.
That's him.
Tommy Ray Haynes.
Go, go, go!
Cut him off!
Aah!
Down!
Get -- ow!
Down!
Get off!
You need any more convincing?
Hey, I put out a BOLO and sent a unit to his cousin's house.
Yeah, we impounded his pickup.
So at least for the moment, he's on foot.
We need to get Tommy Ray's photo out to every taxi and bus driver in the county.
Already did, and any reports of stolen vehicles will be sent directly to me immediately.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah.
Let me see.
No.
It's fine.
Let me see.
See?
There are some advantages about being thick-skinned.
Didn't break the surface.
Still, you should probably get it looked at.
- You had a tetanus shot lately?
- Yeah, about a year ago.
What bit you then?
Or should I say "who"?
An alligator.
Well, caiman, actually.
They found Ashley Whitfield's car.
Here we go.
What here we go?
The way you look at Detective Harper.
I wasn't looking at her any way.
Only one other woman I've ever seen you look at like that, my friend.
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're wrong.
- I'm not.
The service guy says Ashley dropped her car off four days ago, never came back to pick it up.
I showed him a picture of Tommy Ray Haynes, but he's never met him.
So much for the theory that the killer took her car.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean he was never in it.
- What do you got?
- Gum.
Smoker's gum?
Like the kind that helps you quit.
Yeah.
Ashley Whitfield was not a smoker.
And if Tommy Ray Haynes is trying to quit, he's doing a terrible job.
He stunk of nicotine when I fought him.
But we do know someone in the mix who is trying to quit.
And who obviously lied about his relationship with Ashley.
Even if the gum was mine, it doesn't prove that I killed Ashley.
Well, it proves you're a liar who had something to hide about a murdered woman.
That sort of usually goes hand in hand with the person that killed her.
I am not lying.
Ashley and I barely knew each other.
She gave me a ride once.
It was no big deal.
I'm not just talking about the gum, Jared.
We did our homework on you.
Well, actually, an enthusiastic paid intern did his homework on you.
The timeshare company that you work for, Sun 'n Lakes?
Yeah, they have a corporate headquarters in Elk Grove Village, a suburb of Chicago.
Okay.
So?
So, you've been with them for around six years, starting in about 2005.
That's the exact same time that the killings began.
But I don't live in Chicago.
I live here.
But for the first three years, you worked out of corporate headquarters.
And since then, you've been flying back and forth from here to Chicago.
Plenty of enough time to rev up, plan, and execute the murders.
I am telling you you got it all wrong.
I don't know anything about Ashley's murder, and I damn sure never killed anybody in Chicago.
We can put you with the victim, we can put you in Chicago at the exact time of each of the murders, and thanks to that intern I was talking about, who hooked up with FDLE fraud division,
we know that you may or may not be Jared Nolan.
So the question is, who the hell are you?
Terry McCabe, maybe?
Or Chad Crandall.
Chad -- really?
That's just -- let me just go over here and find Bob Wilson so we can arrest you on the murders of two, maybe three --
I'm hoping all nine women.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
Fine.
I'd been using my job to get credit-card information and selling it, but that is all.
And Jared Nolan is my real name.
Credit-card fraud, Jared?
Or maybe just aliases to hide your day job as a serial killer.
Red flags went up at corporate.
I needed another source.
Ashley was an aerobics instructor at Saw Grass Village, where her grandmother lived.
Saw Grass Village?
What?
A 55-and-older master-planned community.
Most of the units are filled with retired snowbirds from the Midwest.
Sue me.
Old people make soft targets --
You and Ashley worked this scam together?
No.
She never knew about it.
Ashley and I hooked up a couple of times.
I stole her password, I got the information from her computer.
She made friends with a lot of the older women, even after her grandmother died.
And Ashley being such a soft target, well, that was just too good to pass up, huh?
I really appreciate you thinking of me for this.
I mean, I've heard of forensic nursing.
I just never really saw myself pursuing it.
So think about it.
Look, the money's good, and the hours are flexible.
You wouldn't have to change jobs or quit going to med school.
You know, really, what it does is it lets you set the pace that works with your lifestyle and your crazy schedule.
- Director Manus.
- Yeah.
Oh, um, Callie, this is Detective Sam Harper.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be new.
I haven't seen you around.
Oh, I-I'm not from here.
I'm from Chicago.
Oh.
Jim's from Chicago.
Jim and I were partners on the Northside strangler case.
Ah.
He's amazing.
Yeah.
You got another suspect?
Person of interest.
We'll see if he graduates to suspect.
Okay.
Well, keep me in the loop on that.
Definitely.
Oh, uh, Callie.
Sam, this is Callie.
This is --
We've, uh -- We've met already.
Okay.
Oh.
Good.
Good.
Nice job in there, by the way.
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly a confession but definitely enough to hold him on, at least until we check out Saw Grass Village, where Ashley's grandmother lived.
Her grandmother?
I have a hunch.
Which we should probably check out, so, um, I-I'll see you later?
Actually, do you have a minute?
Oh, I'll -
- I'll -- I'll wait for you in the car.
I'll walk you out.
Sure.
Okay.
So, that's your old partner?
Unofficially.
Uh, actually, she was state.
I was Chicago local.
You two were together, weren't you?
I mean, Jim, I can tell.
For a while.
And now she's here?
For a while, Cal.
It's not a problem.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah. 18 months -- a lifetime ago, right?
She means nothing to me.
But clearly she did.
I get that we have people in our past.
It's just you never bothered to mention her to me?
Well...
Look, no.
You're right.
You're right.
I -- right, I probably should have.
But Sam lives Chicago.
I live here.
The sooner we catch this guy, the sooner she goes home.
I really got to go.
Yeah.
Go.
No, I'm not eliminating Jared as a suspect.
I'm saying, if Ashley spent time here, maybe our killer did, too.
This is a 55-and-older community.
Ashley's grandmother was in her 70s.
That's a decade outside of our killer's target victimology.
Yeah, but not a 26-year-old granddaughter.
She made friends with her grandmother's pals.
Maybe one of those pals meant something to the killer.
Hey, I said it was a hunch.
You were the one that said he was looking for a new hunting ground.
I did say that, didn't I?
Yeah.
Hey, so, uh, Callie's pretty hot.
It's -- you never mentioned who, just that you'd met someone.
Can we...
Oh, fine.
Jared Nolan stole identities.
Maybe he stole "Bob Wilson,"
rented himself a house in Chicago, didn't realize that the name had been recycled back through the system.
But Jared Nolan isn't running.
Tommy Ray is.
Yeah, the Northside killer was never about outrunning us.
He was about outsmarting us.
Or trying to.
There.
You see?
A hunch.
Tragic what happened to Ashley.
Such a sweet girl, always helping out.
But not to speak ill of the departed, but she and her grandma were the only ones that could handle Doris.
Northside Braille Institute.
Gulf Coast School for the Blind.
Southeast Services for the Blind.
Doris was devoted to helping the blind.
Not exactly the warmest person.
Blind devotion?
Try obsession.
Try I think we found it.
Found what?
The stressor we never saw before, the reason he's been killing.
Off the top of my head?
I'm going with mom.
What do you got?
Not sure.
I'm thinking flour, like for baking.
As in that evidence you're about to eat --
Yep.
Six weeks stale.
Just confirming it.
I'll run this to the lab.
So, what does all this mean?
It means our previous assumptions about why he blacked out the victims' eyes is wrong.
It wasn't shame.
It was anger.
At blind people?
At his mother's devotion for the blind -- love she showed them, but not him.
Doris Fowler died in a hospice, completely alone.
No one ever came to visit her.
No one claimed the body.
Ashley made all the arrangements.
Hmm, all these people she gave her life to, and no one even cared to come see her?
She didn't give a rat's ass about them.
She gave a rat's ass about this -- look at me, how amazing I am.
"Giving" of myself.
Not even her own family?
Well, she only had one son -- Kevin Fowler.
Estranged, apparently.
Management's never met him or spoken to him, and there's no record of him ever visiting his mother.
Yeah, in my experience, serial killers don't sign the guest book.
So, Doris Fowler moves from Chicago.
His anger dissipates.
The killings stop.
She's diagnosed with cancer, forcing contact.
The pressure builds up again.
Six weeks later, she dies.
And the killings resume -- twin Chicago, and now here.
Which tells us what?
It tells us the pain of being denied his mother's attention was so profound, his anger so intense that he wanted to kill her.
But he couldn't.
So he kills surrogates.
First one, then another.
Women that triggered the rage he had for his mother, until he worked up the nerve to kill her.
But she gets diagnosed with cancer, triggers the need to kill again.
And then dies, the selfish bitch, robbing him of the chance of killing her and ending his agony.
So he kills Ashley Whitfield.
The question now is, who the hell is Kevin Fowler?
We know Jared nolan used identities.
Well, Doris Fowler was devoted to helping others.
Maybe she took in foster children just to add another notch to her belt.
Tommy Ray Haynes was in and out of foster care.
There you go.
Try that.
Uh, what's going on in here?
Dad's showing me how to make his famous three-cheese lasagna.
His three-cheese lasagna.
I haven't had that in a while.
I saw that you put the money in the account ahead of schedule.
Yeah, a couple good nights.
Look, this is gonna be ready in an hour.
If you want to grab a beer and go sit out on the porch.
I'd love to, but, um, I picked up a shift.
So...
Okay.
Well, then, uh, we'll save you a plate, and you can nuke it when you get home.
Okay.
And Tommy Ray Haynes bounced in and out of the foster care system his whole life, and Doris Fowler did take in foster children in Illinois.
You do know how long it'll take to unseal Tommy Ray's juvie record, right?
Try weeks.
No.
We don't have weeks.
Another body will probably turn up in the next couple of days, if not sooner.
All right, look, I'll reach out to a judge buddy of mine, see if I can expedite that.
Thank you.
This is what we never had before -- the rage he had for his mother.
He's been killing nurturers and caregivers, women he wanted his mother to be.
Why didn't I see this before?
Because we could never connect the victims to a single victimology -- I mean, we've got moms, career women, women who volunteered --
All with nurturing qualities, love and attention they gave to other people.
But not Crystal Benson.
The stripper.
Crystal had no children.
She was in and out of prison, drug rehab.
She could barely take care of herself.
She doesn't fit the profile, which, of course, as we all know, if one thing doesn't fit...
Then none of it fits, and you have nothing.
Or does she?
Okay, you really need to have that looked at.
No, no, no.
There's no time.
It's not what we see that made them victims.
It's what he saw and probably, no doubt, the thing that he sees in his next victim.
I mean, we've got three stay-at-home moms, two educators, a social worker.
He's obviously targeting them for their nurturing quality -- love and attention that they gave to others -- including Crystal.
I don't know, Jim.
The stripper's a stretch.
Her stage name -- Florence Nightingale.
A nurse.
It's probably nothing, but you never want to take your chances with a dog bite.
That wasn't that bad, was it?
Nah, I'm good.
She usually picks up.
I'm sure she's fine.
During his first spree, who gave the killer the most attention, Sam?
It was us.
It was you and me.
This whole time, I've had this feeling -- the killings in Chicago, now here Florida.
What if he's been watching us, knew I was in Florida, knows who I'm close to?
Callie?
No, it's me.
I checked stolen car reports like you asked.
Any with GPS?
Any at the hospital?
Unfortunately, yes.
Callie Cargill?
Have you seen her?
Not in the last hour or so.
Hey!
Stay back!
Get off!
Where's Callie?
!
Get off me!
Where is she?
!
You're not gonna pin this on me!
You couldn't before!
You can't now!
Get off me!
You got him?
You got him?
Go, go.
I got him.
Go.
Get down!
Stay down!
Callie?
Callie!
Callie?
Oh, my God!
Hey!
What the --
Oh, my God.
Jim, what's wrong?
Did you treat a guy for a dog bite earlier?
Yeah.
About 20 minutes ago, why?
Wait, is that the serial killer you guys are after?
I mean, the whole hospital is freaking out.
Jim...
Tommy Ray is in custody -- raving mad and still not cooperating, but, you know, at least he's off the street.
Callie, are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't even know I was in trouble.
All right, well...
Congratulations, Jim.
This one's a long time coming.
Come on.
I'm sure after all this time, it's probably pretty hard to believe it's all over.
Wh-- uh, yeah.
Thanks.
It is over, Jim.
Go and celebrate with that partner of yours.
You both have it coming to you.
Actually, I do need to check if she's all right.
Yeah, of course.
No, go.
Well, that's got to feel good, getting that monkey off your back.
I guess.
You guess?
It's time to celebrate, amigo.
You on your way back?
I'll buy you and Sam a drink.
Yeah, I got to file my report.
And I think Sam's got a slightly different celebration in mind.
Yeah.
I'm sure she does.
No.
She just wants to kick back and catch a few rays.
I told her I'd throw some spiny lobster on the grill.
She's on the first flight back to Chicago in the morning.
Which reminds me, uh, Sam was bugging me about that white substance we found in Doris Fowler's condo.
Results came back.
It's diatomaceous earth.
What's it?
It's used in pool filtration.
You startled me.
Hello, Detective Harper.
Shh.
But not your partner.
He -- he -- he just wanted to catch me.
Not like you, Detective Harper.
You knew what I was going through.
You knew what I saw when I -- when I looked at those women -- giving others the love and attention that i deserved.
But she wouldn't give it to me, would she?
No, not mom, not the great Doris Fowler.
She gave everything she had to others!
But you knew that, didn't you, Detective Harper?
You knew because, deep down, you are just like them, aren't you -- always thinking of someone else, somebody other than yourself...
Unlike your partner, who only thinks of himself.
Well, let's see how he feels about this, huh?
See how he feels when he sees what I have waiting for him.
Aah!
He showed up five weeks ago, said he was taking over the pool business from his cousin who just moved to Seattle.
No doubt we'll find his cousin rotting in the swamp.
It's too bad.
Kevin Fowler actually did a better job on my pool.
Hey, and thank God for that unsettled feeling of yours.
We are done now, right?
Uh, Jared Nolan committed credit-card fraud...
Mm-hmm.
...Tommy Ray Haynes flapping his gums in prison has him being investigated under a totally unrelated murder, and Kevin Fowler killed nine women, including my pool guy.
Three bad guys for the price of one, so, yeah.
Yeah, I'd say we're done.
She'll have some bruising, but it'll go away.
Still, you need to be checked out at a hospital, okay?
I'll go get the medics.
Much better.
Chalk this up to that really special way you have of getting under people's skin.
Hey, seemed he was a lot madder at you than he was at me.
Only thing he did to me was clean my pool.
His mom moving away at least allowed him to control his urges.
Then once he lost the opportunity to kill his mom, figured next best thing -- get us together for his last big hurrah.
Well, we were the only people that actually cared about him.
Which is either really sad or really twisted.
So...
Um...
We never had a chance to finish our conversation.
Yeah.
Well, you're leaving now, so...
I'm not, actually.
You're not leaving?
Well, I have to interview Fowler, do my debriefing ahead of his extradition.
See if I can link him to any other missing persons.
Why?
My sticking around isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
What?
Uh, no.
No, no.
Uh, why would it be?
I don't know.
It's -- just checking.

[Police Radio Chatter]
Show me.
It's him.
- [Camera Shutter Clicks]
- He told me his name was Bob Wilson.
He paid cash every month for two and a half years till about six weeks ago.
- He just disappeared.
- You run a credit check, grab a social, photo l.D.?
No.
You rented a house to a guy you never laid eyes on?
I rented a house to his 950 bucks a month.
That's not a crime, is it?
Hold this.
[Beeps]
[Woman's Voice] Hello.
This is a courtesy call for Bob Wilson.
Thank you for your recent visit to Sun 'N Lakes time-share here in sunny south Florida.
We look forward to seeing you soon for your complimentary, all-expenses-paid weekend... at our fabulous four-star resort.
[Beeps]
[Cell Phone Rings]
[Ringing]
Hey.
Hi.
I just wanted to call and say hi.
Hi to you.
Jeff and Ray are doing yard work.
Giving you a chance to call and say hi.
How you doing?
We're good.
We're hanging in there.
Super Soaker.
Uh, hall
- Hall.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you should, uh-
Yeah, I need to go.
[Beeps]
Ah.
Uh, it's none of my business... but I can see the pool hasn't been used much lately.
Uh, a friend's son used to come over and use it.
If I cut back to twice a month, you could probably save a few bucks.
- Um, let me think about it?
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- Cool.
Oh, and, uh, I used to pay your cousin online.
Uh, yeah, I'm not really set up for that.
I'm not much of a computer guy.
- Me neither.
All right, check it is.
- Okay.
[Sighs]
Oh, uh, y-you want a check now?
Why?
I haven't done anything yet.
Nice place.
Yeah, it's, uh
- It's good to see you too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
How are you?
How's tricks?
Long time no see.
Is that better?
Jim, he's back.
Are you sure it's him?
White female, 25 to 32, dirty blonde hair, blacked-out eyes.
Yeah, I'm sure.
And you're in my backyard, why?
Because I believe the Northside Strangler is here in Florida.
[People Chattering]
[Colleen] The Northside Strangler?
Between '05 and late 2008, he was linked with the abduction and murder of six women.
- [Sam] These two make eight.
- Now eight.
I headed up the Chicago side of the task force... with Detective Harper of the Illinois State Bureau for almost four years.
Until our unsub went dormant and our trail turned to ice.
A message from Sun 'N Lakes time-shares was left on our suspect's phone three days ago.
- Is that her?
- [Jim] Yeah.
What I found two days ago in Chicago... is the first activity we've clocked in two and a half years.
Okay, fine.
But what makes you- or, rather, her- think that the unsub is here?
Detective Harper seems to think that he's searching for a new hunting ground.
He's territorial.
Six kills within the same eight square miles... then stops- imprisonment, maybe injury- then kills again in the same zone... with the same victimology and the same blacked-out eyes... then bolts in the middle of the night to visit time-shares in Florida.
He's on the move, and my guess is he's gonna kill again soon.
- She sounds pretty confident.
- Yeah.
That's one word for it.
Okay, fine.
But, uh, while she's here, she's your problem.
And that's another.
Thanks.
[Man] Thanks for your time.
Ah.
You must be Mr. and Mrs.-
- Uh, Longworth and Harper.
- Detectives Longworth and Harper.
- I thought you were here for the promotion.
- Maybe.
What are you offering?
Well, we have a fantastic offer.
By attending a one-day presentation... we are gifting a complimentary two days... of tennis, golf and fabulous food at our world-class facility.
Sounds good.
How many sales pitches do we have to sit through for that?
Well, they're not pitches, per se... but there are a series of guest meetings throughout the week.
Ah.
Now, did a Bob Wilson attend one of those guest meetings?
Maybe.
Uh, is there some trouble?
- [Sam] We believe he may have killed eight women.
- A serial killer?
Yeah, who may have attended one of your presentations.
So, uh, if we could loop back around to that question.
Yes.
We do have a Bob Wilson in our records.
And he was scheduled to attend two weeks ago, but he never showed up.
But he did attend this past weekend.
Can you describe him?
Uh, between the Sun 'N Lakes and, uh, Citrus Estates locations... we have over 340 guests.
I notice a lot of your guests are wearing l.D. badges.
Can you give us a copy of Bob Wilson's?
We take l.D.'s after lunch... and it looks like he left after the first session in the morning.
Didn't want his picture taken.
Any of your female guests not return after lunch?
All the women came back except a Margaret Palmer.
Did not come back after the first day.
Meaning she sat through the presentation but didn't stick around for the cool free shit?
- Do you have her picture?
- Mm-hmm.
[Jim] You got an address for this Margaret Palmer?
She was just here on vacation, and she was staying at the Westin.
Fits the profile.
According to our records, Margaret Palmer hasn't used her room card in two days.
When is she scheduled to check out?
She's booked through tomorrow.
- I'll check the bedroom.
- Thank you.
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh.
Miss Palmer?
- Get out!
- No, no, wait.
I'm Jim Longworth, F.D.L.E.
- Get out!
- Watch it!
Watch it!
You're gonna...
- stun yourself.
- I see you haven't lost your touch with the ladies.
[Sam] If we'd dug a little deeper, we would have realized... that other than a vague physical resemblance...
Margaret Palmer did not fit our victimology.
Yeah, she required the assistance of a walking cane.
He's never targeted the weak before.
Was there any forensic evidence that pulled it all together?
There was never any physical evidence, no D. N.A. to link him to the victims.
Although there was ash from a cigarette found on every victim.
So we assume our killer's a smoker.
Anything that linked the victims together?
Apart from Chicago and general physical similarities, nothing.
We have two schoolteachers, a speech therapist, a social worker-
[Jim] A crossing guard and three stay-at-home moms.
Not like any stay-at-home mom I've ever seen.
- Crystal Benson was a stripper.
- Worked a pole right in the middle of our kill zone.
Which begs the question- was there any sexual assault?
No.
No sexual component.
Violence is sex for them.
It's at the heart of their urges.
Which is what we think is behind the weird blackening-of-the-eyes thing.
Yeah.
What's that about?
[Sam] Shame at who he is and what he's done.
- [Jim] So he can't look back at them.
- Hmm.
Three and a half years you guys lived in this guy's head.
- That explains you.
But you?
- [Sam Laughs]
- [Colleen] You got lucky.
- I did?
Awesome.
Yeah.
Margaret Palmer decided not to press charges.
Yeah, I wasn't even in the room, so-
Detective Harper, I like to asset share as much as the next lawman... but in case you haven't noticed, this is Florida... meaning we've got no shortage of deviants to track down.
So until or unless you can show me some evidence of your Northside Strangler-
like, I don't know, a body-
I'm gonna need to take my bodies back.
I love her.
Seriously, she's awesome.
[Horn Honks]
[Jeff] Oh, my gosh.
Hey, is this yours?
Will be in two years when I pay off the loan.
- This is awesome.
- Come on.
Jump inside.
Look at it.
[Jeff] All right.
Well, look at you, all official.
So how did you-
Oh, uh, a buddy of mine.
- Him and his wife kind of got knocked up, so-
- Kind of got knocked up?
Right.
Money was tight, and they let me take over the payments.
That's industrious.
Well, it lets me hit the ground running, you know, be my own boss.
Oh, um, I took some money out of our joint account... just for, like, the first payment and gas and stuff like that.
- I hope that's okay.
- Yeah, of course.
No, that's your money too.
Promise I'll have it back in there by the end of the week.
Really, it's not a problem.
- Hey, can we take it for a ride?
- Absolutely.
Let's go.
- Load up.
- All right.
Come on, Mom.
There's room for you.
I should, uh, start on the laundry, but you guys have fun.
We will.
You really want these women staring back at you again?
Or not staring back.
I can't tell you how many times I've done this- stand there, staring at his victims... agonizing over what we could have overlooked.
So much of those three and a half years just haunting me daily.
Really?
I haven't given it a second thought.
But then it was easier for me, not being around it when I left.
Yeah, you did sort of vanish into the night.
- So how was it?
- How was what?
The wedding.
It... wasn't.
I
- I mean, I- lt
- It didn't- didn't happen.
Oh.
They're my grandmother's.
Um, I always loved them, and, well, it tends to keep the wolves at bay.
Yeah, well, got to keep those wolves at bay.
I was so sure there was something that was bringing him here.
It wouldn't be the first blind alley we've been down with him.
Two new victims after nearly four years?
Something's triggering his kills, Jimmy, something new- a stressor we haven't seen before.
- Well, I'm sure you've kept tabs on, uh-
- Tommy Ray Haynes.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's doing 22 months for a felony elude to evade down in Joliet.
[Chuckles] He always did like to run.
And you always did like him for it.
Look, if I'm right and he's here, why Florida, Jimmy?
- l-
- Why this time-share?
Every female guest is accounted for.
Am I that far off base, or are we just missing something?
Or someone.
The guests were accounted for, not the employees.
Daniel, I need you to do something.
Ashley Whitfield, 26, fits the profile.
Hasn't been to work in three days.
That's not a good sign.
Ashley Whitfield?
[Camera Shutter Clicks]
The neighbor didn't see anything, but she did notice Ashley's car was missing.
- The killer's never taken a victim's car before.
- Who needs a car in Chicago?
Just a pain in the ass trying to find a place to park.
But Florida-
Detectives, I ran down the source of that voice mail message... from Bob Wilson's machine like you asked me to.
Like you asked him to?
It wasn't actually from the time-share company itself.
It was from a call center in New Delhi.
They called from a master list of everyone from Chicago... who visited Florida in the last six months- over 40,000 people.
Records indicate they left that message five weeks ago... but there's no real way to trace who actually placed the call to Bob Wilson.
All right, yeah.
Hi.
Probably just one of thousands anyway.
You know what?
Get us an A.P.B. on Ashley Whitfield's car.
Right away.
- Now.
- Okay.
[Carlos] I won't know till I get her on the table... but based on the bruising on her neck and throat... and what feels like a hyperextension of the larynx... manual strangulation appears to be the cause of death.
I could be more conclusive if they hadn't blacked out her eyes.
You can tell so much by the eyes.
- They obviously spoke to our killer.
- Yeah, and not in a good way.
- Thanks, Carlos.
Let us know.
- You got it.
There was no evidence of cigarette ash like in all the other crime scenes.
Or that special smoker smell.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I went ahead and e-filed with the commissioner's office... to inform them that you'll be working this case with Detective Longworth.
Just remember that while you're here, you're working under his badge and under Florida law.
You said this guy kills two women within days of each other, right?
That's been his pattern.
A new stressor in his life triggers such a need to kill... he kills once, then he kills again-
Then guilt or remorse sets in, and he stops, each time after two.
If this new pattern is anything like the old one... my guess is he's already chosen his next victim.
So find this guy, fast.
Look, we have a pretty good idea where he and Ashley's paths crossed.
- I'm thinking we start-
- Sun 'N Lakes time-share, right?
What?
Ashley's dead?
From this serial killer that you're after?
We think her death might be related to the series, yeah.
- How well did you know Ashley?
- Not very.
She did her thing with the guests.
I did mine.
- We didn't have a lot of interaction.
- lnteraction?
Well, did you see her interacting an unusual amount with anyone- guest, coworker maybe?
Not really.
And we weren't coworkers in the traditional sense.
What does that mean?
She taught water aerobics to our guests, but she did that at a lot of places- hotels, health clubs, 55-and-older planned communities.
Oh!
How's that going?
- Pardon?
- Nicorette.
I remember when I quit, the cravings just about drove me nuts.
Cancer sticks, yeah.
Uh, thank you, big tobacco.
Listen, it's terrible what happened to Ashley... and if there's anything that I can do, you let me know.
Sure.
You never smoked.
Not on purpose.
But he's definitely trying to quit.
In every other crime scene, there was physical evidence that our killer was a smoker... but not in Ashley's apartment.
Maybe our killer is trying to quit.
Not enough to bring him in, but certainly enough to dig deeper.
And now that we've confirmed a victim in Florida... it's time to cross-check our list of persons of interest...
- [Beeping] - see if anybody's migrated to the Sunshine State.
Yeah.
Daniel.
Hey, I need you-
Hey.
Daniel, yeah.
No, it's me.
Listen, can you do a teensy-weensy little something for me?
"Teensy-weensy"?
[Mouthing Words]
You said a little money, Ray.
- Mrs. Cargill.
- Oh, hey.
Uh, please, it's Callie.
- Is everything all right?
- Uh, no.
No.
- Not even close.
- Sorry to hear that.
Seriously, I can handle the workload and the hours... and juggling everyone else's schedule, including my own... but when I can't get enough cash out of the machine... to get a double half cap with Splenda, then, you know-
Okay, so, uh, it's not that bad.
It's just some days I feel like I can't get ahead.
Amen to that.
Callie, you know, your family matters aside for the moment...
- I've seen you at the office-
- Oh, Jim.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
Not Jim.
Carlos actually.
- Carlos?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
No, Carlos is great.
He's actually helping me connect the dots... between medical textbooks and, you know, what happens in the real world.
Exactly.
Let me make a few phone calls.
- Calls?
- Yeah.
I might have an idea I think could work for both of us.
- Would you swing by the office tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Sure.
[Carlos] It's official.
Cause of death is manual strangulation.
- Trace evidence of chloroform in throat and lungs.
- Like the others.
The chloroform is how he disables his victims... so he can do that weird dye thing to their eyes.
There's nothing unusual about the dye itself.
It's food coloring, like the kind you get at any grocery store.
Looks like it's your Northside Strangler all right... which, by the way, the moniker as it is- a little lazy.
- Hey, that's not on us.
- The Tribune coined that expression.
Besides, we didn't want to stoke the guy's fire... by giving him a cool, sexy name he felt he had to live up to.
You think he cared what you called him?
I think he followed our moves and our investigation very carefully.
Detective, that list of persons of interest you asked me to check on... they're all accounted for in Illinois.
- But the guy you thought is in Joliet State Prison-
- Tommy Ray Haynes.
- he was released from prison two months ago.
- What?
That's enough time to do the Chicago killings.
Damn it.
I checked on him earlier in the year.
- They told me he had seven months left.
- Overcrowding changed that.
I need you to check with the Illinois Parole Board, his parole officer.
- Get us a last known.
- Director Manus already did that.
He listed his sister's address in Calumet City, but he never showed up.
And according to D.M.V. records, Tommy Ray Haynes has a cousin who lives here, in Homestead.
[Colleen] You're calling from a bar?
Tommy Ray's not staying with his cousin because his cousin's wife hates him.
But he's in a white '96 Ford pickup... that his cousin lent him, and we're at his cousin's bar.
Worst case- he doesn't turn up, we grab a beer.
Good-bye.
If you promise not to gloat...
I will admit that finding a victim and Tommy Ray in the same state... is a little more than a coincidence.
See?
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Actually, it was harder than it looked.
Fits the classic profile, Jimmy.
Twenty-five to 36 years old, white male, abandoned as a child... in and out of foster care his whole life.
Guys like that, true sociopaths... have no real connection to anyone or anything.
Everything about Tommy Ray Haynes fits the profile.
Of Tommy Ray Haynes.
Seriously?
Oh, my God.
You will not give up.
I'm just saying there's too much at stake to throw all our eggs into Tommy Ray's basket.
[Sighs]
Jim.
Look, despite what you may think...
I am truly sorry about what happened.
Hey, look, it's all in the past.
Just working together so closely, day and night... on an emotionally charged case, you know, things happen.
They did, yeah.
A bunch of times.
- You knew what it was.
- I didn't actually.
I figured it out after three months when you told me you were engaged.
Then I realized exactly what it was.
- Obviously, I was confused.
- Yeah, look
- And hey-
It all worked out for the best, right?
And, actually, I've met someone down here.
- Really?
- Really.
Not a tad available at the moment.
No pattern there.
You know, I asked around your precinct.
Even after the incident with your captain... you could have stayed in your department.
Why didn't you?
Oh, you know.
I got the invitation to your wedding.
Just figured... needed a change of scenery.
So what happened?
I mean, cold feet?
Find him with his secretary?
Richard was a good man.
I thought he was the love of my life... but I was wrong.
- [Vehicle Approaching]
- That's him.
Tommy Ray Haynes?
Go, go, go!
Cut him off!
[Grunts]
- Okay.
- [Dog Barking]
Down!
Down!
- [Yelling] - [Growling]
Get off!
You need any more convincing?
Hey, I put out a BOLO and sent a unit to his cousin's house.
Yeah, we impounded his pickup, so at least for the moment, he's on foot.
We need to get Tommy Ray's photo out to every taxi and bus driver in the county.
Already did, and any reports of stolen vehicles will be sent directly to me immediately.
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
- Hello?
- Let me see.
- No.
It's fine.
Let me see.
See, there are some advantages about being thick-skinned.
Didn't break the surface.
Still, you should probably get it looked at.
You had a tetanus shot lately?
Yeah.
About a year ago.
What bit you then?
Or should I say who?
An alligator.
Well, caiman, actually.
They found Ashley Whitfield's car.
[Chattering]
[Chuckles] Here we go.
- What "here we go"?
- The way you look at Detective Harper.
I wasn't looking at her any way.
Only one other woman I've ever seen you look at like that, my friend.
- Yeah, I'm sure you're wrong.
- I'm not.
[Sam] The service guy says Ashley dropped her car off four days ago.
Never came back to pick it up.
I showed him a picture of Tommy Ray Haynes, but he's never met him.
So much for the theory that the killer took her car.
Yeah, that doesn't mean he was never in it.
- What do you got?
- [Jim] Gum.
Smoker's gum?
Like the kind that helps you quit.
Yeah.
Ashley Whitfield was not a smoker.
And if Tommy Ray Haynes is trying to quit, he's doing a terrible job.
He stunk of nicotine when I fought him.
But we do know someone in the mix who is trying to quit.
And who obviously lied about his relationship with Ashley.
Even if the gum was mine, it doesn't prove that I killed Ashley.
Well, it proves you're a liar who had something to hide about a murdered woman.
That sort of usually goes hand in hand with the person that killed her.
I am not lying.
Ashley and I barely knew each other.
She gave me a ride once.
It was no big deal.
I'm not just talking about the gum, Jared.
We did our homework on you.
Well, actually, an enthusiastic paid intern did his homework on you.
The time-share company that you work for, Sun 'N Lakes?
Yeah, they have a corporate headquarters in Elk Grove Village... a suburb of Chicago.
Okay.
So?
So you've been with them for around six years, starting in about 2005.
That's the exact same time that the killings began.
But I don't live in Chicago.
I live here.
But for the first three years, you worked out of corporate headquarters.
And since then, you've been flying back and forth from here to Chicago.
Plenty of enough time to rev up, plan and execute the murders.
I am telling you, you got it all wrong.
I don't know anything about Ashley's murder...
- and I damn sure never killed anybody in Chicago.
- We can put you with the victim.
We can put you in Chicago at the exact time of each of the murders.
And thanks to that intern I was talking about who hooked up with F.D.L.E. Fraud Division... we know that you may or may not be Jared Nolan.
So the question is, who the hell are you?
Uh, Terry McCabe maybe?
Or Chad Crandall.
Chad.
Really?
That's just-
Let me just go over here and find Bob Wilson... so we can arrest you on the murders of two, maybe three
- I'm hoping all nine women.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
Fine.
[Sighs]
I'd been using my job to get credit card information and selling it, but that is all.
- And Jared Nolan is my real name.
- Credit card fraud, Jared?
Or maybe just aliases to hide your day job as a serial killer.
Red flags went up at corporate.
I needed another source.
Ashley was an aerobics instructor at Saw Grass Village...
- where her grandmother lived.
- Saw Grass Village?
What?
A 55-and-older master-planned community.
Most of the units are filled with retired snowbirds from the Midwest.
Sue me.
Old people make soft targets.
- You and Ashley worked this scam together?
- No.
She never knew about it.
Ashley and I hooked up a couple of times.
I stole her password.
I got the information from her computer.
She made friends with a lot of the older women... even after her grandmother died.
And Ashley being such a soft target... well, that was just too good to pass up, huh?
I really appreciate you thinking of me for this.
I've heard of forensic nursing.
I just never really saw myself pursuing it.
So think about it.
Look, the money's good, and the hours are flexible.
You wouldn't have to change jobs or quit going to med school.
You know, really, what it does is it lets you set the pace... that works with your lifestyle and your crazy schedule.
- Director Manus.
- Yeah.
- Oh, um, Callie, this is Detective Sam Harper.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You must be new.
I haven't seen you around.
- Oh, I'm not from here.
I'm from Chicago.
- Oh.
Jim's from Chicago.
Jim and I were partners on the Northside Strangler Case.
Ah.
He's amazing.
Yeah.
- You got another suspect?
- Person of interest.
- We'll see if he graduates to suspect.
- [Colleen] Okay.
- Well, keep me in the loop on that.
- Definitely.
Oh.
Uh, Callie.
Sam, this is Callie.
This is-
- We've, uh-
- We've met already.
- Okay.
Good.
Good.
- Nice job in there, by the way.
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly a confession... but definitely enough to hold him on... at least until we check out Saw Grass Village, where Ashley's grandmother lived.
- Her grandmother?
- I have a hunch.
Which we should probably check out.
So, um, I'll-I'll see you later?
Actually, do you have a minute?
Oh, I'll
- I'll- I'll wait for you in the car.
- I'll walk you out.
- [Jim] Sure.
- So, that's your old partner?
- Unofficially.
Uh, actually, she was state.
I was Chicago local.
You two were together, weren't you?
I mean, Jim, I could tell.
- For a while.
- And now she's here.
For a while, Cal.
It's not a problem.
- It was a long time ago.
- Yeah.
Eighteen months.
A lifetime ago, right?
- She means nothing to me.
- But clearly she did.
Uh-
I get that we have people in our past.
It's just you never bothered to mention her to me?
Well- [Sighs]
Look
- No, you're right.
You're right.
I-
All right, I probably should have.
But Sam lives in Chicago.
I live here.
The sooner we catch this guy, the sooner she goes home.
I really gotta go.
Yeah.
Go.
No, I'm not eliminating Jared as a suspect.
I'm saying if Ashley spent time here, maybe our killer did too.
This is a 55-and-older community.
Ashley's grandmother was in her 70s.
That's a decade outside of our killer's target victimology.
Yeah, but not a 26-year-old granddaughter.
She made friends with her grandmother's pals.
- Maybe one of those pals meant something to the killer.
- Ah.
Hey, I said it was a hunch.
You were the one that said he was looking for a new hunting ground.
- I did say that, didn't I?
- Yeah.
Hey, so, uh, Callie's pretty hot.
It's
- You never mentioned who, just that you'd met someone.
- Can we-
- Fine.
Jared Nolan stole identities.
Maybe he stole "Bob Wilson." Rented himself a house in Chicago.
Didn't realize that the name had been recycled back through the system.
But Jared Nolan isn't running.
Tommy Ray is.
Yeah, the Northside killer was never about outrunning us.
He was about outsmarting us.
Or trying to.
There.
You see?
A hunch.
[Sighs]
[Woman] Tragic what happened to Ashley.
Such a sweet girl.
Always helping out.
But not to speak ill of the departed... but she and her grandma were the only ones that could handle Doris.
[Sam] Northside Braille Institute?
Gulf Coast School for the Blind?
Southeast Services for the Blind?
[Woman] Doris was devoted to helping the blind.
Not exactly the warmest person.
Blind devotion?
Try obsession.
- Try "l think we found it."
- Found what?
The stressor we never saw before, the reason he's been killing.
Off the top of my head?
I'm going with Mom.
- [Jim] What do you got?
- I'm not sure.
I'm thinking flour, like for baking.
- As in that evidence you're about to eat.
- Yep.
Six weeks stale.
Just confirming it.
[Clears Throat]
I'll run this to the lab.
So, what does all this mean?
It means our previous assumptions... about why he blacked out the victims' eyes is wrong.
It wasn't shame.
It was anger.
- At blind people?
- At his mother's devotion for the blind-
Iove she showed them, but not him.
Doris Fowler died in a hospice, completely alone.
No one ever came to visit her.
No one claimed the body.
Ashley made all the arrangements.
Hmm.
All these people she gave her life to, and no one even cared to come see her?
She didn't give a rat's ass about them.
She gave a rat's ass about this.
"Look at me, how amazing I am- giving of myself."
Not even her own family?
Well, she only had one son, Kevin Fowler.
Estranged apparently.
Management's never met him or spoken to him... and there's no record of him ever visiting his mother.
Yeah, in my experience, serial killers don't sign the guest book.
So Doris Fowler moves from Chicago.
His anger dissipates.
The killings stop.
She's diagnosed with cancer, forcing contact.
The pressure builds up again.
Six weeks later, she dies... and the killings resume, two in Chicago and now here.
Which tells us what?
It tells us the pain of being denied his mother's attention was so profound... his anger so intense, that he wanted to kill her.
But he couldn't.
So he kills surrogates.
First one, then another.
Women that triggered the rage he had for his mother until he worked up the nerve to kill her.
But she gets diagnosed with cancer, triggers the need to kill again.
And then she dies, the selfish bitch... robbing him of the chance of killing her and ending his agony.
So he kills Ashley Whitfield.
The question now is, who the hell is Kevin Fowler?
We know Jared Nolan used identities.
Well, Doris Fowler was devoted to helping others.
Maybe she took in foster children just to add another notch to her belt.
Tommy Ray Haynes was in and out of foster care.
- [Ray] There you go.
Try that.
- Uh, what's going on in here?
Dad's showing me how to make his famous three-cheese lasagna.
His three-cheese lasagna.
I haven't had that in a while.
I saw that you put the money in the account ahead of schedule.
Yeah, a couple good nights.
This is gonna be ready in an hour... if you wanna grab a beer and go sit out on the porch.
I'd love to, but, um, I picked up a shift, so-
Okay.
Well, then, uh, we'll save you a plate... and you can nuke it when you get home.
Okay.
[Sam] I just got off the phone with Illinois Child and Family Services... and Tommy Ray Haynes bounced in and out of the foster care system his whole life... and Doris Fowler did take in foster children in Illinois.
You do know how long it'll take to unseal Tommy Ray's juvie record, right?
- Try weeks.
- No, we don't have weeks.
Another body will probably turn up in the next couple of days, if not sooner.
All right, look, I'll reach out to a judge buddy of mine, see if I can expedite that.
Thank you.
This is what we never had before- the rage he had for his mother.
He's been killing nurturers and caregivers... women he wanted his mother to be.
Why didn't I see this before?
Because we could never connect the victims to a single victimology.
We've got moms, career women, women who volunteered.
All with nurturing qualities- love and attention they gave to other people.
- But not Crystal Benson.
- The stripper.
Crystal had no children.
She was in and out of prison, drug rehab.
She could barely take care of herself.
She doesn't fit the profile... which, of course, as we all know, if one thing doesn't fit-
Then none of it fits, and you have nothing.
Or does she?
- Okay, you really need to have that looked at.
- No, no, no.
There's no time.
It's not what we see that made them victims.
It's what he saw... and probably, no doubt, the thing that he sees in his next victim.
We've got three stay-at-home moms... two educators, a social worker.
He's obviously targeting them for their nurturing quality-
Iove and attention that they gave to others- including Crystal.
I don't know, Jim.
The stripper's a stretch.
Her stage name
- Florence Nightingale.
A nurse.
It's probably nothing... but you never wanna take your chances with a dog bite.
That wasn't that bad, was it?
Nah, I'm good.
[Buzzing]
[Beeping]
- She usually picks up.
- I'm sure she's fine.
During his first spree, who gave the killer the most attention, Sam?
It was us.
It was you and me.
This whole time, I've had this feeling- the killings in Chicago, now here in Florida.
What if he's been watching us... knew I was in Florida, knows who I'm close to?
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- Callie.
No, it's me.
I checked stolen car reports like you asked.
- Any with G.P.S.?
Any at the hospital?
- Unfortunately, yes.
[Tires Squeal]
- Callie Cargill.
Have you seen her?
- Not in the last hour or so.
[Chattering]
[Woman Groans]
[Man] Hey!
Stay back!
[Woman] What's going on?
- Get off!
- Where's Callie?
- Get off me!
- Where is she?
You're not gonna pin this on me.
You couldn't before.
You can't now.
Get off me.
- You got him?
You got him?
- Go!
I got him.
Go.
Go.
- Get down!
Stay down!
- [Gun Cocks]
Callie?
Callie!
- Callie?
Oh, my God!
- Hey!
- What the-
- Oh, my God.
Jim, what's wrong?
Did you treat a guy for a dog bite earlier?
Yeah.
About 20 minutes ago.
Why?
Wait.
Is that the serial killer you guys are after?
I mean, the whole hospital is freaking out.
Jim, Tommy Ray is in custody, raving mad and still not cooperating... but at least he's off the street.
- Callie, are you okay?
- Yeah.
I didn't even know I was in trouble.
All right, well
- Congratulations, Jim.
This one's a long time coming.
Come on.
I'm sure after all this time... it's probably pretty hard to believe it's all over.
Wh
- Uh, yeah.
Thanks.
It is over, Jim.
Go and celebrate with that partner of yours.
You both have it coming to you.
- Actually, I do need to check if she's all right.
- Yeah, of course.
No, go.
Well, that's gotta feel good, getting that monkey off your back.
I guess.
You guess?
It's time to celebrate, amigo.
[Chuckles]
You on your way back?
I'll buy you and Sam a drink.
Yeah.
I got to file my report.
And I think Sam's got a slightly different celebration in mind.
- Yeah.
I'm sure she does.
- No.
She just wants to kick back and catch a few rays.
I told her I'd throw some spiny lobster on the grill.
She's on the first flight back to Chicago in the morning.
Which reminds me.
Sam was bugging me about that white substance we found in Doris Fowler's condo.
Results came back.
It's diatomaceous earth.
- What's it?
- It's used in pool filtration.
[Siren Blaring]
You startled me.
Hello, Detective Harper.
- [Muffled Screaming]
- Shh.
[Man] But not your partner.
He
- He
- He just wanted to catch me.
Not like you, Detective Harper.
You knew what I was going through.
You knew what I saw when I- when I looked at those women- giving others the love and attention that I deserved.
But she wouldn't give it to me, would she?
No, not Mom.
Not the great Doris Fowler.
She gave everything she had to others!
But you knew that, didn't you, Detective Harper?
You knew because, deep down, you are just like them, aren't you?
Always thinking of someone else- somebody other than yourself.
Unlike your partner, who only thinks of himself.
Well, let's see how he feels about this, huh?
See how he feels when he sees what I have waiting for him.
- [Gunshot] - [Groans]
[Groaning]
[Groaning Continues]
[Sirens Blaring]
[Helicopter Whirring]
He showed up five weeks ago... said he was taking over the pool business from his cousin who just moved to Seattle.
No doubt we'll find his cousin rotting in the swamp.
It's too bad.
Kevin Fowler actually did a better job on my pool.
Hey, and thank God for that unsettled feeling of yours.
We are done now, right?
- Uh, Jared Nolan committed credit card fraud.
- Mm-hmm.
Tommy Ray Haynes, flapping his gums in prison... has him being investigated under a totally unrelated murder... and Kevin Fowler killed nine women, including my pool guy.
Three bad guys for the price of one.
So... yeah.
I'd say we're done.
[Carlos] She'll have some bruising, but it'll go away.
Still, you need to be checked out at a hospital, okay?
I'll go get the medics.
Much better.
Chalk this up to that really special way you have of getting under people's skin.
Hey, seemed he was a lot madder at you than he was at me.
Only thing he did to me was clean my pool.
His mom moving away at least allowed him to control his urges.
Then once he lost the opportunity to kill his mom... figured next best thing- get us together for his last big hurrah.
Well, we were the only people that actually cared about him.
Which is either really sad or really twisted.
So, um... we never had a chance to finish our conversation.
Yeah.
Well, you're leaving now, so-
I'm not, actually.
You're not leaving?
Well, I have to interview Fowler, do my debriefing ahead of his extradition... see if I can link him to any other missing persons.
Why?
My sticking around isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
Uh, no.
No, no.
Uh, why would it be?

Show me.
It's him.
He told me his name was Bob Wilson.
He paid cash every month for 2 1/2 years.
Till about six weeks ago, he just disappeared.
You run a credit check, grab a social, photo I.D.?
No.
You rented a house to a guy you never laid eyes on?
I rented a house to his 950 bucks a month.
That's not a crime, is it?
Hold this.
Hello.
This is a courtesy call for Bob Wilson.
Thank you for your recent visit to Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare here in sunny South Florida.
We look forward to seeing you soon for your complimentary, all-expenses-paid weekend at our fabulous four-star resort.
Hey.
Hi.
I just...wanted to call and say "hi."
"Hi" to you.
Jeff and Ray are doing yardwork.
Giving you a chance to call and say "hi."
How you doing?
We're good.
We're hanging in there.
Super soaker?
Uh, hall -- hall.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you should, uh...
Yeah, I need to...go.
Ah.
Uh, it's none of my business, but I can see the pool hasn't been used much lately.
Uh, a friend's son used to come over and use it.
If I cut back to twice a month, you could probably save a few bucks.
Um...
Let me think about it?
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, I used to pay your cousin online.
Uh, yeah, I'm not really set up for that.
I'm not much of a computer guy.
Me neither.
All right, check it is.
Okay.
Oh, uh, y-you want a check now?
Why?
I haven't done anything, yet.
Nice place.
Yeah, it's, uh...
It's good to see you, too.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
How are you?
How's tricks?
Long time, no see.
Is that better?
Jim, he's back.
Are you sure it's him?
White female, 25 to 32, dirty-blond hair, blacked-out eyes.
Yeah, I'm sure.
And you're in my backyard...
Why?
Because I believe the Northside strangler is here in Florida.
♪ The Glades 2x02 ♪ Old Ghosts Original Air Date on June 12, 2011
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
The Northside strangler?
Between '05 and late 2008, he was linked with the abduction and murder of six women -- these two make eight.
Now eight.
I headed up the Chicago side of the task force with Detective Harper of the Illinois State Bureau for almost four years.
Until our unsub went dormant and our trail turned to ice.
A message from Sun 'n Lakes Timeshares was left on our suspect's phone three days ago.
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
What I found two days ago in Chicago is the first activity we've clocked in 2 1/2 years.
Okay, fine.
But what makes you -- or, rather, her -- think that the unsub is here?
Detective Harper seems to think that he's searching for a new hunting ground.
He's territorial -- six kills within the same 8 square miles, then stops -- imprisonment, maybe injury -- then kills again in the same zone with the same victimology and the same blacked-out eyes,
then bolts in the middle of the night to visit timeshares in Florida.
He's on the move, and my guess is he's gonna kill again soon.
She sounds pretty confident.
Yeah.
That's one word for it.
Okay, fine, but, uh, while she's here, she's your problem.
And that's another.
Thanks.
Thanks for your time.
Ah.
You must be Mr. and Mrs...
Uh, Longworth and Harper.
Detectives Longworth and Harper.
Oh.
I thought you were here for the promotion.
Maybe.
What are you offering?
Well, we have a fantastic offer.
By attending a one-day presentation, we are gifting a complimentary two days of tennis, golf, and fabulous food at our world-class facility.
Sounds good.
How many sales pitches do we have to sit through for that?
Well, they're not pitches, per se, but there are a series of guest meetings throughout the week.
Ah.
Now, did a Bob Wilson attend one of those "guest meetings"?
Maybe.
Uh, is there some trouble?
We believe he may have killed eight women.
A-a serial killer?
Yeah, who may have attended one of your presentations, so, uh, if we could loop back around to that question?
Yes.
We do have a Bob Wilson in our records.
And he was scheduled to attend two weeks ago, but he never showed up.
But he did attend this past weekend.
Can you describe him?
Uh, between the Sun 'n Lakes and, uh,
Citrus Estates locations, we have over 340 guests.
I notice a lot of your guests are wearing I.D. badges.
Can you give us a copy of Bob Wilson's?
We take I.D.s after lunch, and it looks like he left after the first session in the morning.
Didn't want his picture taken.
Any of your female guests not return after lunch?
All the women came back except a Margaret Palmer did not come back after the first day.
Meaning she sat through the presentation but didn't stick around for the cool free shit?
Do you have her picture?
You got an address for this Margaret Palmer?
She was just here on vacation, and she was staying at the Westin.
Fits the profile.
According to our records,
Margaret Palmer hasn't used her room card in two days.
When is she scheduled to check out?
She's booked through tomorrow.
I'll check the bedroom.
Thank you.
Who the fuck are you?
Oh.
Ms. Palmer?
Get out!
No, no, no, wait.
I'm Jim Longworth.
I'm FDLE.
Get out!
Watch it!
Watch it!
You're gonna...
Stun yourself.
I see you haven't lost your touch with the ladies.
If we'd dug a little deeper, we would have realized that other than a vague physical resemblance,
Margaret Palmer did not fit our victimology.
Yeah, she required the assistance of a walking cane.
He's never targeted the weak before.
Was there any forensic evidence that pulled it all together?
There was never any physical evidence, no DNA to link him to the victims.
Although there was ash from a cigarette found on every victim, so we assume our killer's a smoker.
Anything that linked the victims together?
Apart from Chicago and general physical similarities, nothing.
We have two school teachers, a speech therapist, a social worker...
A crossing guard, and three stay-at-home moms.
Hmm.
Not like any stay-at-home mom I've ever seen.
Oh, Crystal Benson was a stripper.
Worked a pole right in the middle of our kill zone.
Which begs the question -- was there any sexual assault?
No.
No sexual component.
Violence is sex for them.
It's at the heart of their urges.
Which is what we think is behind the weird blackening of the eyes thing.
Yeah, what's that about?
Shame -- at who he is and what he's done.
So he can't look back at them.
Hmm.
3 1/2 years you guys lived in this guy's head -- that explains you.
But you?
You got lucky.
I did?
Awesome.
Yeah.
Margaret Palmer decided not to press charges.
Yeah, I wasn't even in the room, so...
Detective Harper, I like to asset share as much as the next lawman, but in case you haven't noticed, this is Florida, meaning we've got no shortage of deviants to track down.
So until or unless you can show me some evidence of your Northside strangler -- like, I don't know, a body --
I'm gonna need to take my bodies back.
I love her.
Seriously, she's awesome.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, is this yours?
Will be in two years when I pay off the loan.
This is awesome.
Come on.
Jump inside.
Look at it.
All right.
Well, look at you, all official.
So, how did you...
Oh, uh, a buddy of mine.
Him and his wife kind of got knocked up, so...
Kind of got knocked up?
Yeah.
So, money was tight, and they let me take over the payments.
That's industrious.
Yeah, well, lets me hit the ground running, you know, be my own boss.
Oh, um, I t-took some money out of our joint account, just for, like, the first payment and gas and stuff like that.
I hope that's okay.
Yeah, of course.
No, that's your money, too.
Promise I'll have it back in there by the end of the week.
Really, it's not a problem.
Hey, can we take it for a ride?
Absolutely.
Let's go.
Load up.
All right.
Come on, mom.
There's room for you.
I should, uh, start on the laundry, but you guys have fun.
You really want these women staring back at you again?
Or not staring back.
I can't tell you how many times I've done this, stand there, staring at his victims.
Agonizing over what we could have overlooked.
So much of those 3 1/2 years just haunting me daily.
Really?
I haven't given it a second thought.
But then it was easier for me, not being around it when I left.
Yeah, you did sort of vanish into the night.
So how was it?
How was what?
The wedding.
It...wasn't.
I-I mean, I -- it -- it didn't -- didn't happen.
Oh.
They're my grandmother's.
Um, I always loved them, and, well, it tends to keep the wolves at bay.
Yeah, well, got to keep those wolves at bay.
I was so sure there was something that was bringing him here.
Well, it wouldn't be the first blind alley we've been down with him.
Two new victims after nearly four years?
Something's triggering his kills, Jimmy, something new.
A stressor we haven't seen before.
- Well, I'm sure you've kept tabs on, uh...
- Tommy Ray Haynes?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's doing 22 months for a felony elude to evade down in Joliet.
He always did like to run.
And you always did like him for it.
Look, if I'm right and he's here, why Florida, Jimmy?
Why this timeshare?
I mean, every female guest is accounted for.
Am I that far off base, or are we just missing something?
Or someone.
The guests were accounted for, not the employees.
Daniel, I need you to do something.
Ashley Whitfield, 26, fits the profile.
Hasn't been to work in three days.
That's not a good sign.
Ashley Whitfield?
The neighbor didn't see anything, but she did notice Ashley's car was missing.
The killer's never taken a victim's car before.
Well, who needs a car in Chicago?
Just a pain in the ass trying to find a place to park.
But Florida...
Detectives, I ran down the source of that voicemail message from Bob Wilson's machine like you asked me to.
Oh, like you asked him to?
It wasn't actually from the timeshare company itself.
It was from a call center in New Delhi.
They called from a master list of everyone from Chicago who visited Florida in the last six months -- over 40,000 people.
Records indicate they left that message five weeks ago, but there's no real way to trace who actually placed the call to Bob Wilson.
All right, yeah.
Hi.
Probably just one of thousands anyway.
You know what?
Get us an APB on Ashley Whitfield's car.
Right away.
Now.
Okay.
I won't know till I get her on a table.
But based on the bruising on her neck and throat, and what feels like a hyperextension of the larynx, manual strangulation appears to be the cause of death.
I could be more conclusive if they hadn't blacked out her eyes.
You can tell so much by the eyes.
- They obviously spoke to our killer.
- Yeah, and not in a good way.
- Thanks, Carlos.
Let us know.
- You got it.
There's no evidence of cigarette ash like in all the other crime scenes.
Or that special smoker smell.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I went ahead and e-filed with the commissioner's office to inform them that you'll be working this case with Detective Longworth.
Just remember that while you're here, you're working under his badge and under Florida law.
Y-you said this guy kills two women within days of each other, right?
That's been his pattern.
A new stressor in his life triggers such a need to kill, he kills once, then he kills again...
Then guilt or remorse sets in, and he stops, each time after two.
If this new pattern is anything like the old one, my guess is he's already chosen his next victim.
So find this guy -- fast.
Look, we have a pretty good idea where he and Ashley's paths crossed.
- I'm thinking we start --
- Sun 'n Lakes Timeshare, right?
What?
Ashley's dead?
From this s-serial killer that you're after?
We think her death might be related to the series, yeah.
How well did you know Ashley?
Not very.
She did her thing with the guests.
I did mine.
We didn't have a lot of interaction.
Interaction?
Well, did you see her interacting an unusual amount with anyone -- guests, co-worker, maybe?
Not really.
And we weren't co-workers in the traditional sense.
What does that mean?
She taught water aerobics to our guests, but she did that at a lot of places -- hotels, health clubs,
55-and-older planned communities.
Oh.
How's that going?
Pardon?
Nicorette.
I remember when I quit, the cravings just about drove me nuts.
Cancer sticks, yeah.
Uh, thank you, big tobacco.
Listen, it's terrible what happened to Ashley, and if there's anything that I can do, you let me know.
Sure.
- You never smoked.
- Not on purpose.
But he's definitely trying to quit.
In every other crime scene, there was physical evidence that our killer was a smoker, but not in Ashley's apartment.
Maybe our killer is trying to quit.
Not enough to bring him in but certainly enough to dig deeper.
And now that we've confirmed a victim in Florida, it's time to cross-check our list of persons of interest, see if anybody's migrated to the sunshine state.
Yeah.
Daniel.
Hey, I need you --
Hey.
Daniel, yeah.
No, it's me.
Listen, can you do a teensie-weensie little something for me?
"Teensie-weensie"?
What?
You said a little money, Ray.
Mrs. Cargill.
Oh, hey.
Uh, please, it's Callie.
Is everything all right?
Uh, no.
No.
Not even close.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, you know, seriously, I can handle the workload and the hours and juggling everyone else's schedule including my own, but when I can't get enough cash out of the machine to get a double half cap with splenda, then, you know...
Okay, so, uh...
It's not that bad.
It's just some days I feel like I can't get ahead.
Amen to that.
Callie, you know, your family matters aside for the moment,
I've seen you at the office...
Oh, Jim.
I know.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
Not Jim.
Carlos, actually.
Carlos?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, Carlos is great.
He's actually helping me connect the dots between medical text books and, you know, what happens in the real world.
Exactly.
Let me make a few phone calls.
Calls?
Yeah.
You know, I -
- I might have an idea
I think could work for both of us.
Would you swing by the office tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Sure.
It's official.
Cause of death is manual strangulation.
Trace evidence of chloroform in throat and lungs.
Like the others.
The chloroform is how he disables his victims so he can do that weird dye thing to their eyes.
There's nothing unusual about the dye itself.
It's food coloring, like the kind you get at any grocery store.
Looks like it's your Northside strangler, all right.
Which, by the way, the moniker as it is -- a little lazy.
Hey, that's not on us.
The Tribune coined that expression.
Besides, we didn't want to stoke the guy's fire by giving him a cool, sexy name he felt he had to live up to.
You think he cared what you called him?
Oh, I think he followed our moves and our investigation very carefully.
Detective, that list of persons of interest you asked me to check on -- they're all accounted for in Illinois.
But the guy you thought is in a Joliet State Prison...
Tommy Ray Haynes.
He was released from prison two months ago.
What?
!
That's enough time to do the Chicago killings.
Damn it.
I checked on him earlier in the year.
They told me he had seven months left.
Overcrowding changed that.
I need you to check with the Illinois parole board, his parole officer -- get us a last known.
Director Manus already did that.
He listed his sister's address in Calumet City, but he never showed up.
And according to DMV records,
Tommy Ray Haynes has a cousin who lives here, in Homestead.
You're calling from a bar?
Tommy Ray's not staying with his cousin because his cousin's wife hates him.
But he's in a white '96 Ford pickup that his cousin lent him, and we're at his cousin's bar.
Worst case -- he doesn't turn up.
We grab a beer.
Goodbye.
All right, if you promise not to gloat,
I will admit that finding a victim and Tommy Ray in the same state, is a little more than a coincidence.
See?
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Actually, it was harder than it looked.
Fits the classic profile, Jimmy.
25 to 36 years old, white male, abandoned as a child, in and out of foster care his whole life.
I mean, guys like that, true sociopaths, have no real connection to anyone or anything.
Everything about Tommy Ray Haynes fits the profile -- of Tommy Ray Haynes.
Seriously?
Oh, my God.
You will not give up.
I'm just saying there's too much at stake to throw all our eggs into Tommy Ray's basket.
Jim...
Look, despite what you may think,
I am truly sorry about what happened.
Hey, look, it's all in the past.
Just working together so closely, day and night, on an emotionally charged case, you know, things happen.
They did, yeah.
A bunch of times.
You knew what it was.
I didn't, actually.
I mean, I figured it out after three months when you told me you were engaged.
Then I realized exactly what it was.
Obviously, I was confused.
Yeah, look, and, hey -- it all worked out for the best, right?
And, actually, I've met someone down here.
- Really?
- Really...
If not a tad unavailable at the moment.
No pattern there.
You know, I asked around your precinct.
Even after the incident with your captain, you could have stayed in your department.
Why didn't you?
Oh, you know.
I...
I got the invitation to your wedding, just figured... needed a change of scenery.
So what happened?
I mean, cold feet?
Find him with his secretary?
Richard was a good man.
I thought he was the love of my life, but I was wrong.
That's him.
Tommy Ray Haynes.
Go, go, go!
Cut him off!
Aah!
Down!
Get -- ow!
Down!
Get off!
You need any more convincing?
Hey, I put out a BOLO and sent a unit to his cousin's house.
Yeah, we impounded his pickup.
So at least for the moment, he's on foot.
We need to get Tommy Ray's photo out to every taxi and bus driver in the county.
Already did, and any reports of stolen vehicles will be sent directly to me immediately.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah.
Let me see.
No.
It's fine.
Let me see.
See?
There are some advantages about being thick-skinned.
Didn't break the surface.
Still, you should probably get it looked at.
- You had a tetanus shot lately?
- Yeah, about a year ago.
What bit you then?
Or should I say "who"?
An alligator.
Well, caiman, actually.
They found Ashley Whitfield's car.
Here we go.
What here we go?
The way you look at Detective Harper.
I wasn't looking at her any way.
Only one other woman I've ever seen you look at like that, my friend.
- Yeah.
I'm sure you're wrong.
- I'm not.
The service guy says Ashley dropped her car off four days ago, never came back to pick it up.
I showed him a picture of Tommy Ray Haynes, but he's never met him.
So much for the theory that the killer took her car.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean he was never in it.
- What do you got?
- Gum.
Smoker's gum?
Like the kind that helps you quit.
Yeah.
Ashley Whitfield was not a smoker.
And if Tommy Ray Haynes is trying to quit, he's doing a terrible job.
He stunk of nicotine when I fought him.
But we do know someone in the mix who is trying to quit.
And who obviously lied about his relationship with Ashley.
Even if the gum was mine, it doesn't prove that I killed Ashley.
Well, it proves you're a liar who had something to hide about a murdered woman.
That sort of usually goes hand in hand with the person that killed her.
I am not lying.
Ashley and I barely knew each other.
She gave me a ride once.
It was no big deal.
I'm not just talking about the gum, Jared.
We did our homework on you.
Well, actually, an enthusiastic paid intern did his homework on you.
The timeshare company that you work for, Sun 'n Lakes?
Yeah, they have a corporate headquarters in Elk Grove Village, a suburb of Chicago.
Okay.
So?
So, you've been with them for around six years, starting in about 2005.
That's the exact same time that the killings began.
But I don't live in Chicago.
I live here.
But for the first three years, you worked out of corporate headquarters.
And since then, you've been flying back and forth from here to Chicago.
Plenty of enough time to rev up, plan, and execute the murders.
I am telling you you got it all wrong.
I don't know anything about Ashley's murder, and I damn sure never killed anybody in Chicago.
We can put you with the victim, we can put you in Chicago at the exact time of each of the murders, and thanks to that intern I was talking about, who hooked up with FDLE fraud division,
we know that you may or may not be Jared Nolan.
So the question is, who the hell are you?
Terry McCabe, maybe?
Or Chad Crandall.
Chad -- really?
That's just -- let me just go over here and find Bob Wilson so we can arrest you on the murders of two, maybe three --
I'm hoping all nine women.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
Fine.
I'd been using my job to get credit-card information and selling it, but that is all.
And Jared Nolan is my real name.
Credit-card fraud, Jared?
Or maybe just aliases to hide your day job as a serial killer.
Red flags went up at corporate.
I needed another source.
Ashley was an aerobics instructor at Saw Grass Village, where her grandmother lived.
Saw Grass Village?
What?
A 55-and-older master-planned community.
Most of the units are filled with retired snowbirds from the Midwest.
Sue me.
Old people make soft targets --
You and Ashley worked this scam together?
No.
She never knew about it.
Ashley and I hooked up a couple of times.
I stole her password, I got the information from her computer.
She made friends with a lot of the older women, even after her grandmother died.
And Ashley being such a soft target, well, that was just too good to pass up, huh?
I really appreciate you thinking of me for this.
I mean, I've heard of forensic nursing.
I just never really saw myself pursuing it.
So think about it.
Look, the money's good, and the hours are flexible.
You wouldn't have to change jobs or quit going to med school.
You know, really, what it does is it lets you set the pace that works with your lifestyle and your crazy schedule.
- Director Manus.
- Yeah.
Oh, um, Callie, this is Detective Sam Harper.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be new.
I haven't seen you around.
Oh, I-I'm not from here.
I'm from Chicago.
Oh.
Jim's from Chicago.
Jim and I were partners on the Northside strangler case.
Ah.
He's amazing.
Yeah.
You got another suspect?
Person of interest.
We'll see if he graduates to suspect.
Okay.
Well, keep me in the loop on that.
Definitely.
Oh, uh, Callie.
Sam, this is Callie.
This is --
We've, uh -- We've met already.
Okay.
Oh.
Good.
Good.
Nice job in there, by the way.
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly a confession but definitely enough to hold him on, at least until we check out Saw Grass Village, where Ashley's grandmother lived.
Her grandmother?
I have a hunch.
Which we should probably check out, so, um, I-I'll see you later?
Actually, do you have a minute?
Oh, I'll -
- I'll -- I'll wait for you in the car.
I'll walk you out.
Sure.
Okay.
So, that's your old partner?
Unofficially.
Uh, actually, she was state.
I was Chicago local.
You two were together, weren't you?
I mean, Jim, I can tell.
For a while.
And now she's here?
For a while, Cal.
It's not a problem.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah. 18 months -- a lifetime ago, right?
She means nothing to me.
But clearly she did.
I get that we have people in our past.
It's just you never bothered to mention her to me?
Well...
Look, no.
You're right.
You're right.
I -- right, I probably should have.
But Sam lives Chicago.
I live here.
The sooner we catch this guy, the sooner she goes home.
I really got to go.
Yeah.
Go.
No, I'm not eliminating Jared as a suspect.
I'm saying, if Ashley spent time here, maybe our killer did, too.
This is a 55-and-older community.
Ashley's grandmother was in her 70s.
That's a decade outside of our killer's target victimology.
Yeah, but not a 26-year-old granddaughter.
She made friends with her grandmother's pals.
Maybe one of those pals meant something to the killer.
Hey, I said it was a hunch.
You were the one that said he was looking for a new hunting ground.
I did say that, didn't I?
Yeah.
Hey, so, uh, Callie's pretty hot.
It's -- you never mentioned who, just that you'd met someone.
Can we...
Oh, fine.
Jared Nolan stole identities.
Maybe he stole "Bob Wilson,"
rented himself a house in Chicago, didn't realize that the name had been recycled back through the system.
But Jared Nolan isn't running.
Tommy Ray is.
Yeah, the Northside killer was never about outrunning us.
He was about outsmarting us.
Or trying to.
There.
You see?
A hunch.
Tragic what happened to Ashley.
Such a sweet girl, always helping out.
But not to speak ill of the departed, but she and her grandma were the only ones that could handle Doris.
Northside Braille Institute.
Gulf Coast School for the Blind.
Southeast Services for the Blind.
Doris was devoted to helping the blind.
Not exactly the warmest person.
Blind devotion?
Try obsession.
Try I think we found it.
Found what?
The stressor we never saw before, the reason he's been killing.
Off the top of my head?
I'm going with mom.
What do you got?
Not sure.
I'm thinking flour, like for baking.
As in that evidence you're about to eat --
Yep.
Six weeks stale.
Just confirming it.
I'll run this to the lab.
So, what does all this mean?
It means our previous assumptions about why he blacked out the victims' eyes is wrong.
It wasn't shame.
It was anger.
At blind people?
At his mother's devotion for the blind -- love she showed them, but not him.
Doris Fowler died in a hospice, completely alone.
No one ever came to visit her.
No one claimed the body.
Ashley made all the arrangements.
Hmm, all these people she gave her life to, and no one even cared to come see her?
She didn't give a rat's ass about them.
She gave a rat's ass about this -- look at me, how amazing I am.
"Giving" of myself.
Not even her own family?
Well, she only had one son -- Kevin Fowler.
Estranged, apparently.
Management's never met him or spoken to him, and there's no record of him ever visiting his mother.
Yeah, in my experience, serial killers don't sign the guest book.
So, Doris Fowler moves from Chicago.
His anger dissipates.
The killings stop.
She's diagnosed with cancer, forcing contact.
The pressure builds up again.
Six weeks later, she dies.
And the killings resume -- twin Chicago, and now here.
Which tells us what?
It tells us the pain of being denied his mother's attention was so profound, his anger so intense that he wanted to kill her.
But he couldn't.
So he kills surrogates.
First one, then another.
Women that triggered the rage he had for his mother, until he worked up the nerve to kill her.
But she gets diagnosed with cancer, triggers the need to kill again.
And then dies, the selfish bitch, robbing him of the chance of killing her and ending his agony.
So he kills Ashley Whitfield.
The question now is, who the hell is Kevin Fowler?
We know Jared nolan used identities.
Well, Doris Fowler was devoted to helping others.
Maybe she took in foster children just to add another notch to her belt.
Tommy Ray Haynes was in and out of foster care.
There you go.
Try that.
Uh, what's going on in here?
Dad's showing me how to make his famous three-cheese lasagna.
His three-cheese lasagna.
I haven't had that in a while.
I saw that you put the money in the account ahead of schedule.
Yeah, a couple good nights.
Look, this is gonna be ready in an hour.
If you want to grab a beer and go sit out on the porch.
I'd love to, but, um, I picked up a shift.
So...
Okay.
Well, then, uh, we'll save you a plate, and you can nuke it when you get home.
Okay.
And Tommy Ray Haynes bounced in and out of the foster care system his whole life, and Doris Fowler did take in foster children in Illinois.
You do know how long it'll take to unseal Tommy Ray's juvie record, right?
Try weeks.
No.
We don't have weeks.
Another body will probably turn up in the next couple of days, if not sooner.
All right, look, I'll reach out to a judge buddy of mine, see if I can expedite that.
Thank you.
This is what we never had before -- the rage he had for his mother.
He's been killing nurturers and caregivers, women he wanted his mother to be.
Why didn't I see this before?
Because we could never connect the victims to a single victimology -- I mean, we've got moms, career women, women who volunteered --
All with nurturing qualities, love and attention they gave to other people.
But not Crystal Benson.
The stripper.
Crystal had no children.
She was in and out of prison, drug rehab.
She could barely take care of herself.
She doesn't fit the profile, which, of course, as we all know, if one thing doesn't fit...
Then none of it fits, and you have nothing.
Or does she?
Okay, you really need to have that looked at.
No, no, no.
There's no time.
It's not what we see that made them victims.
It's what he saw and probably, no doubt, the thing that he sees in his next victim.
I mean, we've got three stay-at-home moms, two educators, a social worker.
He's obviously targeting them for their nurturing quality -- love and attention that they gave to others -- including Crystal.
I don't know, Jim.
The stripper's a stretch.
Her stage name -- Florence Nightingale.
A nurse.
It's probably nothing, but you never want to take your chances with a dog bite.
That wasn't that bad, was it?
Nah, I'm good.
She usually picks up.
I'm sure she's fine.
During his first spree, who gave the killer the most attention, Sam?
It was us.
It was you and me.
This whole time, I've had this feeling -- the killings in Chicago, now here Florida.
What if he's been watching us, knew I was in Florida, knows who I'm close to?
Callie?
No, it's me.
I checked stolen car reports like you asked.
Any with GPS?
Any at the hospital?
Unfortunately, yes.
Callie Cargill?
Have you seen her?
Not in the last hour or so.
Hey!
Stay back!
Get off!
Where's Callie?
!
Get off me!
Where is she?
!
You're not gonna pin this on me!
You couldn't before!
You can't now!
Get off me!
You got him?
You got him?
Go, go.
I got him.
Go.
Get down!
Stay down!
Callie?
Callie!
Callie?
Oh, my God!
Hey!
What the --
Oh, my God.
Jim, what's wrong?
Did you treat a guy for a dog bite earlier?
Yeah.
About 20 minutes ago, why?
Wait, is that the serial killer you guys are after?
I mean, the whole hospital is freaking out.
Jim...
Tommy Ray is in custody -- raving mad and still not cooperating, but, you know, at least he's off the street.
Callie, are you okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't even know I was in trouble.
All right, well...
Congratulations, Jim.
This one's a long time coming.
Come on.
I'm sure after all this time, it's probably pretty hard to believe it's all over.
Wh-- uh, yeah.
Thanks.
It is over, Jim.
Go and celebrate with that partner of yours.
You both have it coming to you.
Actually, I do need to check if she's all right.
Yeah, of course.
No, go.
Well, that's got to feel good, getting that monkey off your back.
I guess.
You guess?
It's time to celebrate, amigo.
You on your way back?
I'll buy you and Sam a drink.
Yeah, I got to file my report.
And I think Sam's got a slightly different celebration in mind.
Yeah.
I'm sure she does.
No.
She just wants to kick back and catch a few rays.
I told her I'd throw some spiny lobster on the grill.
She's on the first flight back to Chicago in the morning.
Which reminds me, uh, Sam was bugging me about that white substance we found in Doris Fowler's condo.
Results came back.
It's diatomaceous earth.
What's it?
It's used in pool filtration.
You startled me.
Hello, Detective Harper.
Shh.
But not your partner.
He -- he -- he just wanted to catch me.
Not like you, Detective Harper.
You knew what I was going through.
You knew what I saw when I -- when I looked at those women -- giving others the love and attention that i deserved.
But she wouldn't give it to me, would she?
No, not mom, not the great Doris Fowler.
She gave everything she had to others!
But you knew that, didn't you, Detective Harper?
You knew because, deep down, you are just like them, aren't you -- always thinking of someone else, somebody other than yourself...
Unlike your partner, who only thinks of himself.
Well, let's see how he feels about this, huh?
See how he feels when he sees what I have waiting for him.
Aah!
He showed up five weeks ago, said he was taking over the pool business from his cousin who just moved to Seattle.
No doubt we'll find his cousin rotting in the swamp.
It's too bad.
Kevin Fowler actually did a better job on my pool.
Hey, and thank God for that unsettled feeling of yours.
We are done now, right?
Uh, Jared Nolan committed credit-card fraud...
Mm-hmm.
...Tommy Ray Haynes flapping his gums in prison has him being investigated under a totally unrelated murder, and Kevin Fowler killed nine women, including my pool guy.
Three bad guys for the price of one, so, yeah.
Yeah, I'd say we're done.
She'll have some bruising, but it'll go away.
Still, you need to be checked out at a hospital, okay?
I'll go get the medics.
Much better.
Chalk this up to that really special way you have of getting under people's skin.
Hey, seemed he was a lot madder at you than he was at me.
Only thing he did to me was clean my pool.
His mom moving away at least allowed him to control his urges.
Then once he lost the opportunity to kill his mom, figured next best thing -- get us together for his last big hurrah.
Well, we were the only people that actually cared about him.
Which is either really sad or really twisted.
So...
Um...
We never had a chance to finish our conversation.
Yeah.
Well, you're leaving now, so...
I'm not, actually.
You're not leaving?
Well, I have to interview Fowler, do my debriefing ahead of his extradition.
See if I can link him to any other missing persons.
Why?
My sticking around isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
What?
Uh, no.
No, no.
Uh, why would it be?
I don't know.
It's -- just checking.

Previously, on CSI:
New York...
TAYLOR:
John Curtis raped another woman.
He's in New York.
The victim walked into Flack's precinct, he took the report, and then he recognized Curtis as your old DC rape case.
Who was she, the victim?
Ali.
Ali Rand.
LINDSAY:
In DC, your colleague made a mistake in the first round of DNA testing and then destroyed the documentation, when you knew that John Curtis was your guy.
Serena Matthews, the senator's daughter.
Your DNA was planted on her underwear?
I was acquitted.
I came here to make you a promise.
You will not walk away this time.
You put that bitch on the stand, your case'll fall apart faster than your career did in the FBI.
You don't believe me, do you?
Please tell the court the expected dose-related effect on a person who's ingested 1,000 milligrams of GHB.
Death.
ATTORNEY:
So either your test is wrong, or Miss Rand is lying.

Mr. Curtis, please stand..
Some of the testimony we've heard here today is cause for concern and raises serious questions as to the credibility of the victim.
I have been moved to grant defense counsel's request for a reduced bail down to the sum of $25,000.
(gallery murmuring)
(gavel bangs) This court is adjourned.
We'll see everyone back here on the eighth of January.
NEWSMAN:
Late-breaking news today as John Curtis, the man commonly referred to as the "DC Rapist,"
will be released on $25,000 bail.
This dramatic turn of events occurred after the judge heard surprising testimony from the New York Crime Lab suggesting levels of GHB in the alleged victim's system were inconsistent with her statements.
There's no word yet as to whether the Manhattan D.A.
will pursue the case further.
Jo... what happened?
Serena, it's okay.
That girl Lindsay who works with you...
I thought she was on our side.
She had to tell the truth.
The truth is that Curtis raped that girl and... they just let him go.
Again.
All this means is that he's been released on bail.
There's a difference.
Not to me.
We're gonna get him.
- How can you possibly say that?
- Because there are a lot of good people who still want to see this guy behind bars.
What, your associate on the stand up there?
You?
I have seen John Curtis walk out of a courtroom, a free man, twice.
Both times you were there.
I'm not involved in this case, Senator, as you know.
And yet, somehow it fell apart.
Dad, let's just go.
My daughter already paid her price.
Nothing can change that.
This is about all the other daughters that had to suffer since you let Curtis go the first time.
Come on.
Senator Matthews, I'm Jo Danville.
This is my associate.
Frank Waters, FBI Crime Lab.
Yes, I know.
I requested you.
Can you tell us what happened?
We've been told very little.
My daughter, uh, was attacked tonight.
She came home beaten, half drugged.
- You take her to the hospital?
- Of course not.
There can't be any press, no news conferences.
My daughter has got to be protected.
That's why I avoided the DC police.
Where's your daughter now?
Serena?
They're here.
(muffled sobs)
Look what he did to my little girl.
(siren wailing)
You know you can't be doing that.
You shouldn't even be within ten feet of that evidence.
John Curtis is posting bail as we speak.
I can't sit back and watch this case fall apart.
The case isn't yours, Jo.
It's Lindsay's.
She'll be the one to go back over the evidence.
And you should get some distance.
You know John Curtis is not just another bad guy to me.
I can't pretend this is business as usual.
Yeah, I get that, it's personal.
All the more reason why you should step away.
Nobody knows this guy better than me.
I spent 11 months in DC on this case.
Of course it's personal.
But you know I can help this case.
Why don't you look over the evidence from the DC rapes.
Could be a detail that'll help us here.
Thank you.
Danny works with you.
You don't process anything.
Nothing where your signature shows up,
- so you can't be subpoenaed.
- Deal.
Whatever you find, find it fast.
The only thing keeping this case alive is Ali's statement.
You said I was gonna be safe.
But that maniac is back out there.
Who do you think he's pissed at right now, the crime lab?
Look, Ali, you just need to take a breath here.
They're calling me a liar in the newspaper, a whore.
I told you not to read the papers.
The D.A. is doubting my statements now.
Well, there are inconsistencies.
So you think I'm lying, too.
The levels of GHB in your system suggest that Curtis gave you a lethal dose.
You should be dead.
Can you explain that?
I don't know;
I'm not a scientist.
But without the physical evidence of you being drugged, all we have is your testimony.
Forget it.
I'm not doing this anymore-- I'm dropping the charges.
Let's be clear about something.
There is no dropping these charges.
Okay?
You can't un-ring this bell.
You cannot force me to testify.
No.
But the D.A. can, and he will.
You're in this, Ali.
(siren wailing)
Okay, thanks for checking.
All right, so this is everything the FBI forwarded us on the DC rape cases.
Not much here to look at.
Curtis was careful.
Used cash buying them drinks, used condoms when he raped them, he used hotels so maids cleaned the sheets-- no evidence.
We only ever loosely connected him
- to four attacks.
- Right.
The senator's daughter was the only one ever to cooperate.
DANVILLE:
Serena, I wanted to tell you what we're gonna do, so there are no surprises.
I'm gonna take some photographs, then I'm gonna do an examination with what we call a sexual assault kit, and ask you a couple of questions.
Is that okay?
Frank, can I get that camera?
Okay, there's gonna be a flash.
(shuddering breaths)
Frank, do you mind stepping out for a moment?
I'm sorry.
It's just I'm so embarrassed.
There's no reason to be.
If I hadn't been drinking when this whole...
Serena, listen to me.
This is not your fault.
(panting)
Not your fault.
I remember his face.
If you find him, then... then I can identify him for you.
Good.
Good.
(phone ringing)
Jo.
(ringing continues) Hey, Jo?
Your cell phone's ringing.
LINDSAY:
Mac, I retested the swab from the cut on Ali Rand's cheek, only this time I ran an immunochemical test.
TAYLOR:
Determining the age of the wounds Ali sustained
- during the rape.
- Right.
I figured if we couldn't nail John Curtis on the GHB...
We could confirm that the beating took place when Ali and Curtis were together in the hotel.
Right.
Unfortunately, it proved the opposite.
John Curtis left Ali Rand in that hotel eight hours before my examination.
But according to the P-selection to E-selection ratios, those wounds were sustained only a couple of hours before I took the swab.
Ali didn't just lie about the GHB, she lied about when she was beaten, too.
Mac, she's lying about everything.
Thank you.
Saw you at the courthouse yesterday.
I saw you, too.
You looked busy--
Senator Matthews.
Yeah, like old times, huh?
Did you go to the hearing?
Didn't work out the way I thought.
How are you, Frank?
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?
Working in the private sector--
Rothwell Laboratories.
You like it?
It's a job.
What about Sally, the boys?
They're in Indiana.
I didn't know.
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in two years.
I'm truly sorry for what happened to you, Frank.
By "what happened to me,"
you mean when you fired me from the FBI?
Okay, is that why you asked me to breakfast?
Because if you think I regret the decision I made, you're mistaken.
No, no, no, I didn't think you'd change your mind.
You made a mistake processing Curtis's DNA and tried to cover it up.
Jo... (sighs)
I-I'm not here to argue.
I have thought about this long and hard, I really have.
When I came to the courthouse, I wanted to speak with you,
I wanted to...
let you know I understand.
Okay, thank you.
But then I watched Curtis get away with it again, and all the things I wanted to say to make amends got stuck in my throat.
I'm not gonna sit here and let you blame me for what you did.
I don't, Jo.
Look, it took me a long time to figure it out, but I messed up and I own it.
If that's really the way you feel, I'm glad for you.
Yeah, but what I do blame you for is not letting it go.
Why didn't you just ignore my mistake?
I had a responsibility, Frank.
To Serena, to the other victims.
If you'd just put your personal ethics to the side one time, none of this would be happening now.
Clearly you still don't understand what happened two years ago, and there's no point rehashing the past.
You're right, it was a mistake calling you.
It won't happen again.
DISPATCH:
Got a homicide in Central Park-- female, mid-20s, apparent victim of assault.
LINDSAY:
Who called it in?
Couple from Iowa, in town to see Spider-Man on Broadway, after a walk in the park.
Odds were pretty good they were going to see a dead body either way.
She was putting on a pretty good show herself.
I aged the cut under her eye from the rape.
She might have done it to herself.
Well, she didn't do this to herself.
ROSS:
Wow.
This looks like a postcard--
I mean, except for the dead body, of course, but the rest of it, wow, look at it.
Huh?
Total postcard.
"Wish you were here."
Shut up and help me roll her.
Blunt-force trauma to the head.
Caved part of her skull in.
Multiple blows?
It's hard to say.
I don't see any spatter.
It could have been just one shot.
It depends what she was hit with.
This.
There's blood on it.
ROSS:
Oh, that'd do it.
LINDSAY:
So she was killed here.
It wasn't a dump job.
It's probably not premeditated, right?
I mean, it'd be strange if someone planned to kill her with a rock.
You never know.
Perp might have been following her.
Could have snuck up behind her and, bang, lights out.
The result of a heated argument.
Unsatisfied customer.
What?
She's a call girl.
Don't make me sorry I brought you out here.
If she really did fabricate the rape story, there's definitely one guy who would want to confront her.
And John Curtis just got released on bail.
FOREMAN:
We, the jury, find the defendant, John Curtis, not guilty of rape in the first degree.
JUDGE:
Mr. Curtis, having been found not guilty of these charges, you are free to go.
Okay.
He say anything yet?
Not about Ali Rand.
I don't get it.
Why would he agree to come in and then not be willing to talk?
He's willing to talk, just not to me.
He specifically requested you.
This is Detective Jo Danville.
We're at the 12th Precinct.
In the room with me is John Curtis.
This interview is being recorded
- for the purpose of...
- This isn't an interview.
Excuse me?
This isn't an interview.
I asked you here.
If anything, I'm interviewing you, but I'd prefer to call it a discussion.
Nevertheless, the camera is here to record the...
To make sure I don't falsely claim something happened?
I mean, I can understand that.
I might leave here and go beat the hell out of myself and then come back and claim police brutality.
I hope you appreciate the irony here, you know, considering that you were so eager to believe--
Ali was her name?
Well, against my better judgment and even more so, against my lawyer's wishes,
I'll tell you this:
I did have sex with her.
But I didn't rape her.
And why would she lie about that?
Money.
If not mine, the hotel's.
Civil suit would be very lucrative.
Where were you last night?
Where were you last night?
I don't find this amusing.
It's not meant to be.
And I'll tell you why I ask.
Because I'd like to know what your alibi is for Ali's time of death.
The way I see it, you have more motive to kill Ali than I do.
I mean, you were so close, you could taste it.
You had a victim who suffered increased violence, who had GHB in her system and just enough memory to remember my name.
You were so close to being able to lay your head down on your pillow and forget me forever, but your star witness turned out to be a fraud, so you let Ali Rand know just how you felt about that.
Send me a copy of that, would you?
I want to replay the look on your face.
(siren wailing)
♪ ♪
Hey, Sid, have you ever seen someone punch herself in the face?
Uh, no.
Are you going to punch yourself in the face?
Uh, let me try that again.
Have you ever had a victim on your table who's exhibited self-inflicted punch wounds to the face?
Uh, well,
I've pretty much seen it all, but no, I have not come across anyone who has successfully punched herself to death.
Why?
(sighs) Ali Rand.
Could the old bruises on her face and the cut under her eye from the rape-- could those have been self-inflicted?
Mm... she seems pretty tough, but I would guess not.
It comes down to simple physics, really.
F = M x A.
Force equals mass times acceleration.
So you don't think she could have generated enough force?
Not to sustain bruises like these or the laceration under her eye.
Ultimately, her fist alone doesn't contain enough mass.
She would have to put her entire weight behind the punch to do this kind of damage.
So, in your medical opinion, somebody else punched Ali?
Yes, someone else punched her.
So she had an accomplice.
And whoever killed her,
I'm thinking he hit her with something that left this behind.
Adam.
Oh, check this out.
TAYLOR:
Okay, what am I looking at?
Dermal denticles.
Shark skin?
- Mm-hmm.
- This is the trace from Ali Rand's coat?
Yeah.
Weird, right?
Unless her being a call girl is just a front for her real job as a pharmaceutical rep.
I'm not following.
I wasn't either, but I started looking into its uses, and there's this drug company that has been experimenting with protein in shark skin, developing these time-release gelatin capsules.
All right, collagen is extracted from the shark skin and then used to coat a cluster of individual microcapsules.
All right, the person ingests the pill, the outer layer is exposed to the stomach acids.
It dissolves, releasing the drug into the system.
And then the next layer is exposed and releases a second dose of the drug.
Allowing a sustained release of the drug over time, by only taking one pill.
Pretty cool, huh?
Why use shark skin?
Shark skin collagen has a higher degree of blocking damaging UV rays.
So the pills have a longer shelf life.
But this is before being ground up to coat a capsule.
Did Lindsay ever mention Ali having a connection to a pharmaceutical company?
DANVILLE:

I never meant for any of this to happen.

If I could go back...
Just go back and undo what I did.
Why don't we talk about it, Frank?
Let's just sit down and talk about it.
Tell me where you are.

That son of a bitch.
I know there are more.
More what, Frank?
It's my fault.
Your intentions were good.
They were.
I know that.
All I wanted was for him to go away so he could never do it again.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Frank!
No, no, no!

Just spoke to Jo.
She's heading back to the M.E.'s office with Frank's body.
Our buddy Frankie-- he never met a piece of paper he didn't like.
I guess they didn't teach organization at Quantico, huh?
This isn't just sloppiness.
It's obsession.
Yeah.
I mean, he's got tons of surveillance photos of Curtis, he's got credit card receipts from all the hotel bars he went to.
Frank had a lot of time on his hands.
Flack talked to Frank's employer.
He's been calling in sick two, three times a week.
HAWKES:
Maybe he was taking his work home with him.
This kitchen's set up like a makeshift chem lab.
Plus we got empty containers of metal polish, drain cleaner and camp fuel.
All of which can be used to make GHB.
You think Frank was working with Ali to set up Curtis for rape?
He wanted Curtis to pay after making that mistake in DC.
Tracked him all over New York.
And then what?
He hires Ali to proposition Curtis in public?
HAWKES:
Sure.
Whips up the GHB right here in the kitchen.
Ali could have come here before going to the precinct.
He doses her, then beats her to make it look right, and sends her off to the precinct to make a complaint.
HAWKES:
Something doesn't make sense.
I mean, Frank worked at the FBI crime lab for years.
So how did he get the GHB levels so wrong?
Ali could have accidentally taken a wrong amount.
I mean, there are a number of things that could have gone sideways.
And when they did, Frank got worried Ali would give him up.
So, he confronts her at the park.
What did you tell them?
Nothing.
I'm done with this.
And made sure she'd stay quiet.
Tiger Woods, look out.
Got my own clubs.
Close the door, Frank.
Uh-oh.
Someone in trouble?
I spent all night with this;
couldn't sleep.
I was just sick to my stomach.
You missed a marker on John Curtis's DNA profile.
No.
The DNA's a match.
All 13 loci.
You got my report.
Yeah, I got it, March 3.
I signed off on it, and you testified to it in court.
And then I found this, dated March 2.
The first time you tested John Curtis's DNA when you missed a marker.
Where did you get that?
From the printer queue in the lab.
I assume you destroyed the original.
Look, Jo,
I made a mistake.
It's not just a mistake, Frank.
You know I have to alert the defense.
Oh, you do that, this whole case could blow up.
You've given me no choice.
(sighs)
He was a friend of yours?
Used to be close.
Yeah.
How is it possible to misjudge a person so?
I trusted this man.
And now he's suspected of murder.
Yeah, and I can't wrap my head around that.
Well...
I haven't found any physical evidence that directly connects Frank to Ali Rand's murder, but I did find this.
Irritation on the right hand and several fingertips.
Looks like chemical burns.
I found similarly inflamed tissue on the inside of his nostrils.
Sent samples up to the lab.
You know, supposedly, Frank was making GHB in the apartment.
Suggests he wasn't wearing gloves or a respirator.
Also supports the theory that he was helping Ali set up John Curtis.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Yeah, me, too, Sid.
Hey, Mac, one of the patrolmen retrieved Frank Waters' cell phone a few feet from where he killed himself.
Damaged in the collision.
Were you able to retrieve any phone messages or e-mails?
I can do better than that.
I transferred the memory card to my tablet.
Found a conversation between Frank and Ali the day she died.
ALI:
What are you, a cop or something?
FRANK:
Yeah, I used to be, sort of.
I worked on the John Curtis case in DC.
ALI:
Ah.
You did a hell of a job.
FRANK:
Yeah, well, so did you.
I was in court today.
If you're gonna dose yourself with GHB, you better figure out the right levels.
You're crazy.
Yeah, maybe.
And I'm precise.
And so is the New York Crime Lab.
Right now, they are pulling apart every detail of your story.
If you're lying about anything else, they'll know.
Get away from me.
Hey!
I'm right, aren't I?
You tried to frame him.
- Let go of me now.
- You know, you made it almost impossible for anyone else to step forward?
The scrutiny they'd face?
Just let me go.
- When was this recorded?
- About an hour before she was killed.
Why would he record this conversation?
It's like he was collecting evidence, trying to prove that Ali set Curtis up.
Well, doesn't exonerate Frank from the murder, but it changes our theory.
Clearly, he wasn't involved in the setup, but he could have followed Ali to the park... killed her out of anger?
Oh, it's possible.
But if Frank wasn't involved in framing Curtis, what was he doing with all that surveillance, and why was he making GHB?
So, the metal polish and drain cleaner we found in Frank's apartment didn't belong to him.
We found John Curtis's fingerprints all over those containers.
(hissing)
How did Frank get them?
He was following Curtis's movements.
Took a photo of Curtis getting rid of a large trash bag.
Hoping to establish Curtis was making his own GHB.
Yeah, Frank was a busy man.
I sorted through all the other surveillance photos of Curtis and hundreds of credit card receipts.
We got Curtis hitting six or seven different hotels every weekend for the past two months.
And the credit card receipts?
All from the same hotels.
All belonging to female customers, dating as far back as six months ago.
TAYLOR:
Frank figured out what nights Curtis frequented the hotel bars, then collected data on the women who were there.
He was looking for another victim who hadn't come forward.
He'd have to track dozens of different women based only on their credit card information.
Frank was always stubbornly determined.
And that's how he got this.
That's Curtis's car.
I found a tape lift attached to the back of the photo, and it had a single hair on it.
You run it for DNA yet?
Yeah, but no hit in CODIS.
Maybe there doesn't have to be.
A batting coach would tell you to swing from the hips, but that's a good follow-through, though.
What do you know about rare wood?
Not much.
I'm guessing this has to do with the splinter
Sid removed from Ali's head wound.
LINDSAY:
It's Pink Ivory.
It's one of the three rarest varieties on the planet.
It's grown almost entirely in Southern Africa, and it's the sovereign tree of the Zulu Nation.
Should I put a BOLO out on the Zulu royal family?
Not yet.
The traditional weapon from Southern Africa is called a knob kerrie.
It's a cross between a club and a walking stick.
Similar to the Shillelagh in Ireland.
Considered a gentleman's weapon.
Right.
The handle is rounded, so I thought it might have caused the circular bruising on Ali's temple, so
I'm testing them to see if I can match the shape of the bruise.
Although, it's a little conspicuous to be walking around New York with it.
Not if it's out of plain sight.
(knocking on door)
Detective Taylor.
Uh, come on in.
I hope this house call means you've got some good news on the John Curtis case.
I'm not here about John Curtis.
I'm here about Ali Rand's murder.
Serena, would you excuse us one minute?
(sighs)
I come here out of respect for you and what you've accomplished in your life.
I was also wondering where that umbrella of yours is.
The one you carry in your briefcase.
Mac, this is Senator Matthews.
What does this have to do with that woman's murder?
Your umbrella was one of two weapons used to kill her.
(laughs)
So now... now I'm a suspect in a... in the murder of a woman that I-I don't even know.
Last year, you took some high-profile trips--
Miami, Aspen, two-week junket in Europe.
Yeah, it's all Senate business.
According to her financial records,
Ali was in Miami, Aspen and Europe at the same time.
Same hotels, too.
I'm insulted at the innuendo.
How much did you pay her?
I'm a United States Senator.
How much did you pay her to frame John Curtis for rape?
Yes, add that to my-my list of felonies.
I'm going to ask you to leave now.
And I'll come back with a warrant for you to produce that unique umbrella.
And while you're thinking of excuses for how it disappeared, your face will replace John Curtis on the news.
They won't be talking about the DC Rapist anymore.
(sighs)
What would you do, Detective?
If your daughter was violated the way mine was.
He was gonna rape again, unless someone took the initiative.
And so you hired Ali to trap him.
Oh, God, I should've just gunned him down myself.
Um....
Ali picked up Curtis at the hotel.
Afterwards, she and I met at her place.
(exhales)
Ready?
She assured me she could handle the scrutiny of a high-profile investigation.
Then the case began to unravel.
'Cause she started panicking.
She'd call me every few minutes.
I told her we can't have any contact until the trial is concluded, but she insisted on meeting.
And that's when you decided she was a loose end?
The only thing that mattered to me was seeing John Curtis pay his debt.
- I wanted to help you, but they know I'm lying now.
- Hey, Ali, Ali, we are so close.
If you stop now,
Curtis is gonna do it again.
It's not my problem.
No, hey, don't...
don't walk away from me, damn it.
Come on.
Ali...
Ali...
(groaning)
I was desperate.
OFFICER:
Detective Danville?
Yeah, she's, uh, right over there.
Amanda Tanner?
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm Jo Danville, Detective.
I spoke to you on the phone.
Yeah.
Thank you for coming down here.
Can you tell me what this is about?
Maybe we should go to a room where it's a little more private.
Well, I have to be somewhere, so can you just tell me why I'm here?
We need to talk about John Curtis.
I don't know who that is.
You were at the Rapid Lounge, three weeks ago, on Spring Street, right?
He... spilled your drink, maybe offered to buy you a new one?
We left the bar after, um, about an hour, and, uh... he drove me back to my place.
Normally, I wouldn't, I mean...
We just met, but...
I'm not here to judge you, Amanda.
I just need to understand what happened.
Um...
I asked him up, and, uh... he opened a bottle of wine, and we were just talking.
I started to feel... the room started...
You blacked out?
I woke up the next morning and...
I was naked... and my wrists... they were all red.
(crying):
And... and I looked in the mirror and I saw my face.
It's okay.
How did you find me?
DANVILLE:
From a hair in John Curtis's car.
We cross-referenced it to hotel credit card receipts and DMV photos, which led us to you.
I mean, I had the sheets and the wine and the clothes and everything, but...
I just couldn't...
Do you still have those things-- the clothes you were wearing, the wine glass?
Would you mind if we went back to your place and I got those things from you?
It's very important.
DANVILLE:
Great apartment.
Got a lot of light.
AMANDA:
Yeah.
I'm moving, though.
I just can't stay here, you know?
Ah.
Oh, this is great.
There's enough residue left that might contain the GHB.
The clothes are in my bedroom closet.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
DANVILLE:
Have you thought about seeing a therapist?
Might help to talk to someone about what happened.
Yeah, I thought about it.
I just, I think I need some time, you know?
I understand.
What about your parents, have you told them?
Do they live in the city?
Amanda?
Amanda?
(door creaks)
(grunts, body thuds)
(coughs)
(spits)
(coughs)
(coughs)
Get up.
Come on.
Get up!
(shards crunching underfoot)
Beg me not to kill you.
Come on, I want to hear you say it.
Never.
(spits)
Attagirl.
You never did know when to give up, did you?
You know how some experts say that sick people... (bullet clatters) people like me, you know, that ultimately, we want to be caught?
Hmm?
That the mistakes we make are intentional.
Or that we stray from some particular course of action because we like the risk?
Those experts are morons.
I have no intention of being caught.
This... was not intentional.
You got too close, Jo.
Can I call you Jo?
Uh-oh.
No bullets.
(sighs)
Come on.
Come on, you can do it.
There you go.
(grunts)
You know how most gun accidents happen and people end up shooting themselves?
Bang.
You got me.
You finally got me.
They always forget the one in the chamber.

Previously, on New York...
John Curtis raped another woman.
He's in New York.
The victim walked into Flack's precinct, he took the report, and then he recognized Curtis as your old DC rape case.
Who was she, the victim?
Ali.
Ali Rand.
In DC, your colleague made a mistake in the first round of DNA testing and then destroyed the documentation, when you knew that John Curtis was your guy.
Serena Matthews, the senator's daughter.
Your DNA was planted on her underwear?
I was acquitted.
I came here to make you a promise.
You will not walk away this time.
You put that bitch on the stand, your case'll fall apart faster than your career did in the FBI.
You don't believe me, do you?
Please tell the court the expected dose-related effect on a person who's ingested 1,000 milligrams of GHB.
Death.
So either your test is wrong, or Miss Rand is lying.

Mr. Curtis, please stand..
Some of the testimony we've heard here today is cause for concern and raises serious questions as to the credibility of the victim.
I have been moved to grant defense counsel's request for a reduced bail down to the sum of $25,000.
This court is adjourned.
We'll see everyone back here on the eighth of January.
Late-breaking news today as John Curtis, the man commonly referred to as the "DC Rapist,"
will be released on $25,000 bail.
This dramatic turn of events occurred after the judge heard surprising testimony from the New York Crime Lab suggesting levels of GHB in the alleged victim's system were inconsistent with her statements.
There's no word yet as to whether the Manhattan D.A.
will pursue the case further.
Jo... what happened?
Serena, it's okay.
That girl Lindsay who works with you...
I thought she was on our side.
She had to tell the truth.
The truth is that Curtis raped that girl and... they just let him go.
Again.
All this means is that he's been released on bail.
There's a difference.
Not to me.
We're gonna get him.
- How can you possibly say that?
- Because there are a lot of good people who still want to see this guy behind bars.
What, your associate on the stand up there?
You?
I have seen John Curtis walk out of a courtroom, a free man, twice.
Both times you were there.
I'm not involved in this case, Senator, as you know.
And yet, somehow it fell apart.
Dad, let's just go.
My daughter already paid her price.
Nothing can change that.
This is about all the other daughters that had to suffer since you let Curtis go the first time.
Come on.
Senator Matthews, I'm Jo Danville.
This is my associate.
Frank Waters, FBI Crime Lab.
Yes, I know.
I requested you.
Can you tell us what happened?
We've been told very little.
My daughter, uh, was attacked tonight.
She came home beaten, half drugged.
- You take her to the hospital?
- Of course not.
There can't be any press, no news conferences.
My daughter has got to be protected.
That's why I avoided the DC police.
Where's your daughter now?
Serena?
They're here.
Look what he did to my little girl.
You know you can't be doing that.
You shouldn't even be within ten feet of that evidence.
John Curtis is posting bail as we speak.
I can't sit back and watch this case fall apart.
The case isn't yours, Jo.
It's Lindsay's.
She'll be the one to go back over the evidence.
And you should get some distance.
You know John Curtis is not just another bad guy to me.
I can't pretend this is business as usual.
Yeah, I get that, it's personal.
All the more reason why you should step away.
Nobody knows this guy better than me.
I spent 11 months in DC on this case.
Of course it's personal.
But you know I can help this case.
Why don't you look over the evidence from the DC rapes.
Could be a detail that'll help us here.
Thank you.
Danny works with you.
You don't process anything.
Nothing where your signature shows up,
- so you can't be subpoenaed.
- Deal.
Whatever you find, find it fast.
The only thing keeping this case alive is Ali's statement.
You said I was gonna be safe.
But that maniac is back out there.
Who do you think he's pissed at right now, the crime lab?
Look, Ali, you just need to take a breath here.
They're calling me a liar in the newspaper, a whore.
I told you not to read the papers.
The D.A. is doubting my statements now.
Well, there are inconsistencies.
So you think I'm lying, too.
The levels of GHB in your system suggest that Curtis gave you a lethal dose.
You should be dead.
Can you explain that?
I don't know;
I'm not a scientist.
But without the physical evidence of you being drugged, all we have is your testimony.
Forget it.
I'm not doing this anymore-- I'm dropping the charges.
Let's be clear about something.
There is no dropping these charges.
Okay?
You can't un-ring this bell.
You cannot force me to testify.
No.
But the D.A. can, and he will.
You're in this, Ali.
Okay, thanks for checking.
All right, so this is everything the FBI forwarded us on the DC rape cases.
Not much here to look at.
Curtis was careful.
Used cash buying them drinks, used condoms when he raped them, he used hotels so maids cleaned the sheets-- no evidence.
We only ever loosely connected him
- to four attacks.
- Right.
The senator's daughter was the only one ever to cooperate.
Serena, I wanted to tell you what we're gonna do, so there are no surprises.
I'm gonna take some photographs, then I'm gonna do an examination with what we call a sexual assault kit, and ask you a couple of questions.
Is that okay?
Frank, can I get that camera?
Okay, there's gonna be a flash.
Frank, do you mind stepping out for a moment?
I'm sorry.
It's just I'm so embarrassed.
There's no reason to be.
If I hadn't been drinking when this whole...
Serena, listen to me.
This is not your fault.
Not your fault.
I remember his face.
If you find him, then... then I can identify him for you.
Good.
Good.
Jo.
Hey, Jo?
Your cell phone's ringing.
Mac, I retested the swab from the cut on Ali Rand's cheek, only this time I ran an immunochemical test.
Determining the age of the wounds Ali sustained
- during the rape.
- Right.
I figured if we couldn't nail John Curtis on the GHB...
We could confirm that the beating took place when Ali and Curtis were together in the hotel.
Right.
Unfortunately, it proved the opposite.
John Curtis left Ali Rand in that hotel eight hours before my examination.
But according to the P-selection to E-selection ratios, those wounds were sustained only a couple of hours before I took the swab.
Ali didn't just lie about the GHB, she lied about when she was beaten, too.
Mac, she's lying about everything.
Thank you.
Saw you at the courthouse yesterday.
I saw you, too.
You looked busy--
Senator Matthews.
Yeah, like old times, huh?
Did you go to the hearing?
Didn't work out the way I thought.
How are you, Frank?
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?
Working in the private sector--
Rothwell Laboratories.
You like it?
It's a job.
What about Sally, the boys?
They're in Indiana.
I didn't know.
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in two years.
I'm truly sorry for what happened to you, Frank.
By "what happened to me,"
you mean when you fired me from the FBI?
Okay, is that why you asked me to breakfast?
Because if you think I regret the decision I made, you're mistaken.
No, no, no, I didn't think you'd change your mind.
You made a mistake processing Curtis's DNA and tried to cover it up.
Jo...
I-I'm not here to argue.
I have thought about this long and hard, I really have.
When I came to the courthouse, I wanted to speak with you,
I wanted to...
let you know I understand.
Okay, thank you.
But then I watched Curtis get away with it again, and all the things I wanted to say to make amends got stuck in my throat.
I'm not gonna sit here and let you blame me for what you did.
I don't, Jo.
Look, it took me a long time to figure it out, but I messed up and I own it.
If that's really the way you feel, I'm glad for you.
Yeah, but what I do blame you for is not letting it go.
Why didn't you just ignore my mistake?
I had a responsibility, Frank.
To Serena, to the other victims.
If you'd just put your personal ethics to the side one time, none of this would be happening now.
Clearly you still don't understand what happened two years ago, and there's no point rehashing the past.
You're right, it was a mistake calling you.
It won't happen again.
Got a homicide in Central Park-- female, mid-20s, apparent victim of assault.
Who called it in?
Couple from Iowa, in town to see Spider-Man on Broadway, after a walk in the park.
Odds were pretty good they were going to see a dead body either way.
She was putting on a pretty good show herself.
I aged the cut under her eye from the rape.
She might have done it to herself.
Well, she didn't do this to herself.
Wow.
This looks like a postcard--
I mean, except for the dead body, of course, but the rest of it, wow, look at it.
Huh?
Total postcard.
"Wish you were here."
Shut up and help me roll her.
Blunt-force trauma to the head.
Caved part of her skull in.
Multiple blows?
It's hard to say.
I don't see any spatter.
It could have been just one shot.
It depends what she was hit with.
This.
There's blood on it.
Oh, that'd do it.
So she was killed here.
It wasn't a dump job.
It's probably not premeditated, right?
I mean, it'd be strange if someone planned to kill her with a rock.
You never know.
Perp might have been following her.
Could have snuck up behind her and, bang, lights out.
The result of a heated argument.
Unsatisfied customer.
What?
She's a call girl.
Don't make me sorry I brought you out here.
If she really did fabricate the rape story, there's definitely one guy who would want to confront her.
And John Curtis just got released on bail.
We, the jury, find the defendant, John Curtis, not guilty of rape in the first degree.
Mr. Curtis, having been found not guilty of these charges, you are free to go.
Okay.
He say anything yet?
Not about Ali Rand.
I don't get it.
Why would he agree to come in and then not be willing to talk?
He's willing to talk, just not to me.
He specifically requested you.
This is Detective Jo Danville.
We're at the 12th Precinct.
In the room with me is John Curtis.
This interview is being recorded
- for the purpose of...
- This isn't an interview.
Excuse me?
This isn't an interview.
I asked you here.
If anything, I'm interviewing you, but I'd prefer to call it a discussion.
Nevertheless, the camera is here to record the...
To make sure I don't falsely claim something happened?
I mean, I can understand that.
I might leave here and go beat the hell out of myself and then come back and claim police brutality.
I hope you appreciate the irony here, you know, considering that you were so eager to believe--
Ali was her name?
Well, against my better judgment and even more so, against my lawyer's wishes,
I did have sex with her.
But I didn't rape her.
And why would she lie about that?
Money.
If not mine, the hotel's.
Civil suit would be very lucrative.
Where were you last night?
Where were you last night?
I don't find this amusing.
It's not meant to be.
And I'll tell you why I ask.
Because I'd like to know what your alibi is for Ali's time of death.
The way I see it, you have more motive to kill Ali than I do.
I mean, you were so close, you could taste it.
You had a victim who suffered increased violence, who had GHB in her system and just enough memory to remember my name.
You were so close to being able to lay your head down on your pillow and forget me forever, but your star witness turned out to be a fraud, so you let Ali Rand know just how you felt about that.
Send me a copy of that, would you?
I want to replay the look on your face.
♪ ♪
Hey, Sid, have you ever seen someone punch herself in the face?
Uh, no.
Are you going to punch yourself in the face?
Uh, let me try that again.
Have you ever had a victim on your table who's exhibited self-inflicted punch wounds to the face?
Uh, well,
I've pretty much seen it all, but no, I have not come across anyone who has successfully punched herself to death.
Why?
Ali Rand.
Could the old bruises on her face and the cut under her eye from the rape-- could those have been self-inflicted?
Mm... she seems pretty tough, but I would guess not.
It comes down to simple physics, really.
F = M x A.
Force equals mass times acceleration.
So you don't think she could have generated enough force?
Not to sustain bruises like these or the laceration under her eye.
Ultimately, her fist alone doesn't contain enough mass.
She would have to put her entire weight behind the punch to do this kind of damage.
So, in your medical opinion, somebody else punched Ali?
Yes, someone else punched her.
So she had an accomplice.
And whoever killed her,
I'm thinking he hit her with something that left this behind.
Adam.
Oh, check this out.
Okay, what am I looking at?
Dermal denticles.
Shark skin?
- Mm-hmm.
- This is the trace from Ali Rand's coat?
Yeah.
Weird, right?
Unless her being a call girl is just a front for her real job as a pharmaceutical rep.
I'm not following.
I wasn't either, but I started looking into its uses, and there's this drug company that has been experimenting with protein in shark skin, developing these time-release gelatin capsules.
All right, collagen is extracted from the shark skin and then used to coat a cluster of individual microcapsules.
All right, the person ingests the pill, the outer layer is exposed to the stomach acids.
It dissolves, releasing the drug into the system.
And then the next layer is exposed and releases a second dose of the drug.
Allowing a sustained release of the drug over time, by only taking one pill.
Pretty cool, huh?
Why use shark skin?
Shark skin collagen has a higher degree of blocking damaging UV rays.
So the pills have a longer shelf life.
But this is before being ground up to coat a capsule.
Did Lindsay ever mention Ali having a connection to a pharmaceutical company?
Rothwell Laboratories?
!
Working in the private sector--
Rothwell Laboratories.
It's Frank Waters.
Frank Waters.
NYPD.
Frank!
How well did you say you knew this guy?
Frank?
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I know Curtis is guilty.
Where are you, Frank?
If I could go back...
Just go back and undo what I did.
Why don't we talk about it, Frank?
Let's just sit down and talk about it.
Tell me where you are.
That son of a bitch.
I know there are more.
More what, Frank?
It's my fault.
Your intentions were good.
They were.
I know that.
All I wanted was for him to go away so he could never do it again.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Frank!
No, no, no!
Frank!
Just spoke to Jo.
She's heading back to the M.E.'s office with Frank's body.
Our buddy Frankie-- he never met a piece of paper he didn't like.
I guess they didn't teach organization at Quantico, huh?
This isn't just sloppiness.
It's obsession.
Yeah.
I mean, he's got tons of surveillance photos of Curtis, he's got credit card receipts from all the hotel bars he went to.
Frank had a lot of time on his hands.
Flack talked to Frank's employer.
He's been calling in sick two, three times a week.
Maybe he was taking his work home with him.
This kitchen's set up like a makeshift chem lab.
Plus we got empty containers of metal polish, drain cleaner and camp fuel.
All of which can be used to make GHB.
You think Frank was working with Ali to set up Curtis for rape?
He wanted Curtis to pay after making that mistake in DC.
Tracked him all over New York.
And then what?
He hires Ali to proposition Curtis in public?
Sure.
Whips up the GHB right here in the kitchen.
Ali could have come here before going to the precinct.
He doses her, then beats her to make it look right, and sends her off to the precinct to make a complaint.
Something doesn't make sense.
I mean, Frank worked at the FBI crime lab for years.
So how did he get the GHB levels so wrong?
Ali could have accidentally taken a wrong amount.
I mean, there are a number of things that could have gone sideways.
And when they did, Frank got worried Ali would give him up.
So, he confronts her at the park.
What did you tell them?
Nothing.
I'm done with this.
And made sure she'd stay quiet.
Tiger Woods, look out.
Got my own clubs.
Close the door, Frank.
Uh-oh.
Someone in trouble?
I spent all night with this;
couldn't sleep.
I was just sick to my stomach.
You missed a marker on John Curtis's DNA profile.
No.
The DNA's a match.
All 13 loci.
You got my report.
Yeah, I got it, March 3.
I signed off on it, and you testified to it in court.
And then I found this, dated March 2.
The first time you tested John Curtis's DNA when you missed a marker.
Where did you get that?
From the printer queue in the lab.
I assume you destroyed the original.
Look, Jo,
I made a mistake.
It's not just a mistake, Frank.
You know I have to alert the defense.
Oh, you do that, this whole case could blow up.
You've given me no choice.
He was a friend of yours?
Used to be close.
Yeah.
How is it possible to misjudge a person so?
I trusted this man.
And now he's suspected of murder.
Yeah, and I can't wrap my head around that.
Well...
I haven't found any physical evidence that directly connects Frank to Ali Rand's murder, but I did find this.
Irritation on the right hand and several fingertips.
Looks like chemical burns.
I found similarly inflamed tissue on the inside of his nostrils.
Sent samples up to the lab.
You know, supposedly, Frank was making GHB in the apartment.
Suggests he wasn't wearing gloves or a respirator.
Also supports the theory that he was helping Ali set up John Curtis.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Yeah, me, too, Sid.
Hey, Mac, one of the patrolmen retrieved Frank Waters' cell phone a few feet from where he killed himself.
Damaged in the collision.
Were you able to retrieve any phone messages or e-mails?
I can do better than that.
I transferred the memory card to my tablet.
Found a conversation between Frank and Ali the day she died.
What are you, a cop or something?
Yeah, I used to be, sort of.
I worked on the John Curtis case in DC.
Ah.
You did a hell of a job.
Yeah, well, so did you.
I was in court today.
If you're gonna dose yourself with GHB, you better figure out the right levels.
You're crazy.
Yeah, maybe.
And I'm precise.
And so is the New York Crime Lab.
Right now, they are pulling apart every detail of your story.
If you're lying about anything else, they'll know.
Get away from me.
Hey!
I'm right, aren't I?
You tried to frame him.
- Let go of me now.
- You know, you made it almost impossible for anyone else to step forward?
The scrutiny they'd face?
Just let me go.
- When was this recorded?
- About an hour before she was killed.
Why would he record this conversation?
It's like he was collecting evidence, trying to prove that Ali set Curtis up.
Well, doesn't exonerate Frank from the murder, but it changes our theory.
Clearly, he wasn't involved in the setup, but he could have followed Ali to the park... killed her out of anger?
Oh, it's possible.
But if Frank wasn't involved in framing Curtis, what was he doing with all that surveillance, and why was he making GHB?
So, the metal polish and drain cleaner we found in Frank's apartment didn't belong to him.
We found John Curtis's fingerprints all over those containers.
How did Frank get them?
He was following Curtis's movements.
Took a photo of Curtis getting rid of a large trash bag.
Hoping to establish Curtis was making his own GHB.
Yeah, Frank was a busy man.
I sorted through all the other surveillance photos of Curtis and hundreds of credit card receipts.
We got Curtis hitting six or seven different hotels every weekend for the past two months.
And the credit card receipts?
All from the same hotels.
All belonging to female customers, dating as far back as six months ago.
Frank figured out what nights Curtis frequented the hotel bars, then collected data on the women who were there.
He was looking for another victim who hadn't come forward.
He'd have to track dozens of different women based only on their credit card information.
Frank was always stubbornly determined.
And that's how he got this.
That's Curtis's car.
I found a tape lift attached to the back of the photo, and it had a single hair on it.
You run it for DNA yet?
Yeah, but no hit in CODIS.
Maybe there doesn't have to be.
A batting coach would tell you to swing from the hips, but that's a good follow-through, though.
What do you know about rare wood?
Not much.
I'm guessing this has to do with the splinter
Sid removed from Ali's head wound.
It's Pink Ivory.
It's one of the three rarest varieties on the planet.
It's grown almost entirely in Southern Africa, and it's the sovereign tree of the Zulu Nation.
Should I put a BOLO out on the Zulu royal family?
Not yet.
The traditional weapon from Southern Africa is called a knob kerrie.
It's a cross between a club and a walking stick.
Similar to the Shillelagh in Ireland.
Considered a gentleman's weapon.
Right.
The handle is rounded, so I thought it might have caused the circular bruising on Ali's temple, so
I'm testing them to see if I can match the shape of the bruise.
Although, it's a little conspicuous to be walking around New York with it.
Not if it's out of plain sight.
Detective Taylor.
Uh, come on in.
I hope this house call means you've got some good news on the John Curtis case.
I'm not here about John Curtis.
I'm here about Ali Rand's murder.
Serena, would you excuse us one minute?
I come here out of respect for you and what you've accomplished in your life.
I was also wondering where that umbrella of yours is.
The one you carry in your briefcase.
Mac, this is Senator Matthews.
What does this have to do with that woman's murder?
Your umbrella was one of two weapons used to kill her.
So now... now I'm a suspect in a... in the murder of a woman that I-I don't even know.
Last year, you took some high-profile trips--
Miami, Aspen, two-week junket in Europe.
Yeah, it's all Senate business.
According to her financial records,
Ali was in Miami, Aspen and Europe at the same time.
Same hotels, too.
I'm insulted at the innuendo.
How much did you pay her?
I'm a United States Senator.
How much did you pay her to frame John Curtis for rape?
Yes, add that to my-my list of felonies.
I'm going to ask you to leave now.
And I'll come back with a warrant for you to produce that unique umbrella.
And while you're thinking of excuses for how it disappeared, your face will replace John Curtis on the news.
They won't be talking about the DC Rapist anymore.
What would you do, Detective?
If your daughter was violated the way mine was.
He was gonna rape again, unless someone took the initiative.
And so you hired Ali to trap him.
Oh, God, I should've just gunned him down myself.
Um....
Ali picked up Curtis at the hotel.
Afterwards, she and I met at her place.
Ready?
She assured me she could handle the scrutiny of a high-profile investigation.
Then the case began to unravel.
'Cause she started panicking.
She'd call me every few minutes.
I told her we can't have any contact until the trial is concluded, but she insisted on meeting.
And that's when you decided she was a loose end?
The only thing that mattered to me was seeing John Curtis pay his debt.
- I wanted to help you, but they know I'm lying now.
- Hey, Ali, Ali, we are so close.
If you stop now,
Curtis is gonna do it again.
It's not my problem.
No, hey, don't...
don't walk away from me, damn it.
Come on.
Ali...
Ali...
I was desperate.
Detective Danville?
Yeah, she's, uh, right over there.
Amanda Tanner?
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm Jo Danville, Detective.
I spoke to you on the phone.
Yeah.
Thank you for coming down here.
Can you tell me what this is about?
Maybe we should go to a room where it's a little more private.
Well, I have to be somewhere, so can you just tell me why I'm here?
We need to talk about John Curtis.
I don't know who that is.
You were at the Rapid Lounge, three weeks ago, on Spring Street, right?
He... spilled your drink, maybe offered to buy you a new one?
We left the bar after, um, about an hour, and, uh... he drove me back to my place.
Normally, I wouldn't, I mean...
We just met, but...
I'm not here to judge you, Amanda.
I just need to understand what happened.
Um...
I asked him up, and, uh... he opened a bottle of wine, and we were just talking.
I started to feel... the room started...
You blacked out?
I woke up the next morning and...
I was naked... and my wrists... they were all red.
And... and I looked in the mirror and I saw my face.
It's okay.
How did you find me?
From a hair in John Curtis's car.
We cross-referenced it to hotel credit card receipts and DMV photos, which led us to you.
I mean, I had the sheets and the wine and the clothes and everything, but...
I just couldn't...
Do you still have those things-- the clothes you were wearing, the wine glass?
Would you mind if we went back to your place and I got those things from you?
It's very important.
Great apartment.
Got a lot of light.
Yeah.
I'm moving, though.
I just can't stay here, you know?
Ah.
Oh, this is great.
There's enough residue left that might contain the GHB.
The clothes are in my bedroom closet.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Have you thought about seeing a therapist?
Might help to talk to someone about what happened.
Yeah, I thought about it.
I just, I think I need some time, you know?
I understand.
What about your parents, have you told them?
Do they live in the city?
Amanda?
Amanda?
Get up.
Come on.
Get up!
Beg me not to kill you.
Come on, I want to hear you say it.
Never.
Attagirl.
You never did know when to give up, did you?
You know how some experts say that sick people... people like me, you know, that ultimately, we want to be caught?
Hmm?
That the mistakes we make are intentional.
Or that we stray from some particular course of action because we like the risk?
Those experts are morons.
I have no intention of being caught.
This... was not intentional.
You got too close, Jo.
Can I call you Jo?
Uh-oh.
No bullets.
Come on.
Come on, you can do it.
There you go.
You know how most gun accidents happen and people end up shooting themselves?
Bang.
You got me.
You finally got me.
They always forget the one in the chamber.

[JOKER CACKLING]
Where there's smoke there's fire, Batsy.
What diabolical devilry have you devised, Joker?
I'll give you a hint.
I'm about to rake you over the coals.
You see, while you roast, we roast you.
Live from an abandoned warehouse in Gotham City it's the Joker's Superhero Celebrity Roast.
[CHEERING]
JOKER:
Tonight's star-studded spectacular brings some of the greatest archvillains together.
To dishonor our least favorite hero, Batman.
Let's get things started with everyone's favorite chunky monkey Gorilla Grodd.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Uh, it's sure great to be at a roast for Batman.
I call dibs on his thigh.
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Mr. Freeze at a roast who would have thawed it?
[VILLAINS CHUCKLE]
MR. FREEZE:
Of all the heroes out there I only have ice for you, Batman.
[ALL GROAN]
VILLAIN 1:
No puns.
VILLAIN 2:
Yikes.
[MUTTERING]
[CHUCKLES]
[MUTTERING]
You're dropping more bombs than the Batplane did on my last hideout, Grundy.
Let's bring in the ringer.
[BAND PLAYING FANFARE]
And now, abducted straight from his show at Nero's Palace please welcome Jeffrey Ross.
[CACKLES]
[VILLAINS APPLAUD]
Oh.
Sorry, Batman.
I only roast the ones I love.
And because they're holding a gun to me.
[VILLAINS LAUGH]
Understood, citizen.
Knock him dead, kiddo.
Or else.
I must say, I'm flattered that of all the comedians, you chose me, Joker.
Don't be.
Groucho was unavailable.
ALL:
Ha-ha-ha!
MR. FREEZE:
Oh, that is cold.
Anyway, great to be here in Gotham City, home of Batman and Robin.
What an undynamic duo those two are.
Am I right, villains?
And, Batman, I just want to know:
Who put you in charge of Robin's adult supervision?
I mean, I'd be worried about letting him walk to school alone and you have him disarming bombs.
[ALL LAUGH]
It's funny because it's true.
Ha-ha-ha!
Yo, Batman, was everyone else over the age of 10 busy?
Ha, ha!
You must call him The Boy Wonder because you can't believe he's alive.
That's right, Ross, keep them laughing.
Yo, Batman, what's up with that utility belt?
Are you here to fight crime or remodel my bathroom?
[VILLAINS LAUGH]
Does it hold up your underwear?
Because after kindergarten, most of us figured out that the undies go inside your pants.
[VILLAINS LAUGH]
At least you don't have to change your underwear every time you see Bane coming for you, huh?
[VILLAINS LAUGHING]
BATMAN:
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Ross.
But I've got a few punch lines of my own I'd like to try out.
Batman?
Free?
Vamoose.
[VILLAINS SHOUTING]
Penguin, they should call you The Nail.
Because you're always getting pounded by the Hammers of Justice.
I'd try not to hit your good side, Two-Face, but you don't have one.
Riddler, the answer to all your riddles is this.
ROSS:
Where do you think you're going?
You've done a lot of terrible things, Joker, but your real crime is against comedy.
[GRUNTS]
Appreciate the assist.
You know, this superhero stuff isn't so hard.
Think I might give it a try.
Stick to comedy, Jeff.
MARTIAN MANHUNTER:
A little higher to the left, Captain Marvel.
Why, Martian Manhunter, you look as nervous as a hermit crab.
Nonsense.
It's just important we make a good impression.
Having a mixer was a great idea.
Who cares what a bunch of fossils have to say?
Are you kidding?
The Justice Society of America are legends.
Just think of all the wisdom they can pass down from their years of...
Boring.
[TELEPORTER BEEPING]
Oh.
Look, the teleporter is activating.
Impossible.
They're not due to arrive for another 20 minutes.
And Batman isn't here.
This whole thing was his idea.
Relax, my friend.
Just go with the flow.
And no more cookies.
You know what they do to you.
Gentlemen, I am J'onn J'onzz.
Welcome to Justice League International headquarters.
Justice League International?
You said it was the other Justice League.
The good one.
I must have read the invitation wrong.
Does that mean Superman won't be here?
Superman is the only reason I came.
Well, please make yourselves at home.
These sure are fancy digs, Martian.
But what good are you floating around in space?
Last time I checked, you can't stop bank robbers from up here.
You got that right.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Ha, ha.
Yes, well, come, my friends.
Plenty of refreshments right this way.
Say, kid, where's the john in this joint?
Down the hall on the left.
Batman, where are you?
Everyone is here.
Sorry, J'onn.
Running a little late.
MARTIAN MANHUNTER [OVER RADIO]:
Things are not getting off to a good start.
BATMAN:
I can't talk now.
Skiing ninjas with lasers.
Batman out.
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS]
[NINJAS GRUNT]
No one's talking to each other.
Ice, why don't you try mingling?
But I don't have to go to the bathroom.
The shrimp's too spicy and the chicken is dry.
Ma Hunkel would never have put out such a shabby spread.
And such small portions too.
Uh, I think we're almost out of food.
Already?
How can that be?
I based my calculations on an average of four glasses of punch per person.
One serving of crudités, two servings of hors d'oeuvres.
There should have been more than enough.
AQUAMAN:
These hors d'oeuvres are outrageous.
MARTIAN MANHUNTER:
They are for the guests.
And you are not a guest.
Don't you understand?
There's nothing worse than running out of food at a party.
Nothing.
Think you could turn up the heat, chief?
It's colder than a polar bear's toenails in here.
Except for that.
[GASPS]
GUY:
So that's the original Green Lantern?
His costume designer must've been color-blind.
Only thing we'll learn from these geezers is how to add more fiber to our diets.
They do smell nice, though.
Like mothballs and menthol rub.
Wildcat, I just...
I can't believe I'm actually meeting you.
My grandpa used to tell me stories about you guys all the time.
Grandpa?
So I told the prime minister, "Call off your submarines or I'll summon a pod of humpback whales to..."
Hold that thought, I gotta see a man about a horse.
So, Spectre, old chum.
Did I ever tell you about the time I...
Never mind.
Where are you going?
Bug Boy here is giving us a tour of this tin can y'all call a headquarters.
That is not going to end well.
[GROANING]
You've had quite an exhausting night, detective.
I hope you found your little nap refreshing.
I never get tired of foiling your twisted schemes, Ra's.
AL GHUL:
I'd hardly call restoring ecological balance to Earth a "twisted scheme," but to each his own, detective.
Soon I shall fire a fusion rocket into the sun.
The resultant solar flares will melt all ice on the planet in a matter of days flooding the continents.
Farewell, detective.
[GROWLING]
Hello.
Guy, is it?
Hal Jordan's told me a lot about you.
Keeping out of trouble?
Not if I can help it, old-timer.
In my day, there wasn't time for social events when we were on active duty.
But with a Green Lantern like Hal keeping Earth safe you don't worry about that, do you?
What's that supposed to mean?
Ooh!
J'onn said there's going to be pie later.
I love pie, don't you?
[YAWNS]
Ugh!
Would you mind looming somewhere else, please?
Batman, do you read me?
Why doesn't he answer?
If you're relying on Batman to be the life of the party I'm afraid you're whistling the wrong tune.
That's it.
Music.
How could I have forgotten music?
Never fear, old chum.
If music is what you need, I've got just the thing.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, everyone.
I thought I'd entertain you with a rendition of an Atlantean spiritual.
Perhaps you've heard of it.
"Nearer Our Fins to Thee"?
It goes a little something like this:
[IMITATING WHALES SINGING]
By H'ronomeer, I need a cookie.
[GROWLING]
Talia.
Why did you save...
I see.
Um, thanks.
STARMAN:
This place is huge.
Definitely bigger than our old brownstone headquarters in Civic City, eh, Wildcat?
Hmph.
Hunk of junk.
[WILDCAT SNIFFS]
What's that smell?
Oh, uh, heh.
That's my cabin.
What in the Sam Hill?
Yeah, I guess it's a little messy.
"A little messy"?
This is a disgrace, son.
I can't even see the floor.
Is that a pile of garbage or your bunk?
I should be able to bounce a quarter off that mattress.
Why would you want to?
I need air.
It's a movie title.
One word.
- Bite.
Masticate.
- Teeth.
Eat.
Eat.
- Chomp.
- Hand-waving.
JAY:
To chew.
MID-NITE:
Clapping.
Oh, come now, you're not even trying.
Where are you going?
Can't you see we're in the middle of the greatest game of charades ever?
Uh, nature calls.
Mandible.
You were supposed to be one of the most powerful Lanterns ever.
But your ring is vulnerable to wood.
So, what happens if a guy comes at you with a pointy stick?
Same thing that happens to you if he paints it yellow.
GUY:
Was that some kind of crack, old man?
ALAN:
If the ring fits, Gardner.
Batman to Watchtower, Batman to Watchtower, come in.
Watchtower, this is an emergency, please respond.
Great.
I think now would be a good time for pie.
Oh, no, the pies.
I left them in the oven.
Ice, stall for time.
Mind your own business, gramps.
Hey!
Let's all share a story.
I'll start.
I'll call this tale, "Please Stop Fighting, It's Getting Awkward."
It is my business, Gardner.
No wonder this new league is such mess if you're the caliber of hero they've sunk to using.
ALL:
Mm-hmm.
Hey, I'm proud to be on this team.
You'd be proud if you could figure out how to work a vacuum cleaner.
Easy, there.
JLI may do things our own way, but we get the job done.
You know, the other league didn't have do things "their own way."
I guess this new generation just doesn't mind embarrassing themselves.
Yeah, well, I'd put our guys up against your so-called "Mystery Men" any day.
The mystery is how you geezers managed to make it this far.
This party might not be out of punch after all.
What can you expect from a backup Lantern with a bad attitude and a cheap haircut?
- It's go time, old man.
Now, friends, that's no way for heroes to behave.
[GRUNTS]
Suffering swordfish.
[YELLING]
[BOTH GRUNTING]
[ALARM BEEPING]
I have a little surprise.
Who wants pie?
Ah!
[ALL GRUNTING]
Holy moly.
Hey, Wildcat.
[ALL GRUNTING]
[GROWLING]
[ALARM BEEPING]
[GRUNTING]
Your ingenuity never ceases to amaze me, detective.
But in this case, I know you had assistance.
Sadly, you'll be dead before the sun incinerates you.
So, uh, who gets to make the big entrance quip?
After you, sir.
Age before beauty.
Well, thanks, Fish Face.
All right, punks.
The party's over.
That's right.
Your ecological incursion ends here, Ra's Al Ghul.
Ha, ha!
Yah!
You're too late, heroes.
[ALL GRUNTING]
GUY ALAN:
I got it.
[ALL GRUNTING]
Lights out, creep.
That's the right prescription, Doctor.
Unh!
Let's go a couple rounds, big boy.
I've had heavybags that hit back harder than you do.
[ALL GRUNT]
[GROWLING]
Eat this, squid face.
Squid face!
Ho!
[ALL GRUNTING]
I'll free Batman, you smash that rocket.
You read my mind.
AL GHUL:
Face me, detective.
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Why won't you just perish already?
[BOTH GRUNTING]
This time I shall watch the life fade from your eyes, detective.
You should have been watching my hands.
[SCREAMS]
[SCREAMING]
The way you fight, kid, I almost don't mind you sleeping in a pigsty.
I suppose we owe you an apology.
We haven't been very good guests.
That's for sure.
You see, we thought this new league had dismissed our ways of doing things forgotten our traditions.
Are you kidding?
You guys didn't just do the superhero group thing first, you did it the best.
We saw a lot of us in you out there.
It's nice to know the spirit of the JSA is alive and well.
I see I missed quite the party.
Yes.
My little soiree was just the thing they needed.
It seems different generations can bond over a common desire.
- Justice?
- Pie.
[English
- US
- SDH]
Enough!
I can't take it anymore, do you hear me?
I can't take it anymore!
Bastards!
Damn you!
You decide who goes out and who stays.
And the others?
Those like me?
There's no hope for me.
I'll go out anyway.
It works this way because you decided it.
You're good.
You've done well.
The people don't know.
They're deceiving themselves.
If one's not part of the circle, what does he have to do?
Die?
!
Does he have to give up?
He can't do a thing.
There's no space.
You left everything in the hands of these whores!
They do whatever the fuck they want to!
You made everybody die, and you don't give a damn!
You're doing it on purpose.
You studied this thing well.
People will go crazy, make mistakes...
Mistakes!
They're making mistakes, so you're in the right.
You can say it:
"You see, you made a mistake?"
It's easy that way!
You're giving an illusion so you can cover your asses!
The people don't know.
They all believe things.
If you get angry, it's your fault.
You must be quiet, subdued!
You must suffer hoping, waiting.
You see them passing by in front of you, arrogantly.
They think they're something they're not.
They don't have the humility to understand that they're worth nothing.
Nothing!
They think they're indispensable, doing their important things.
They were only lucky enough to be born without a dick!
You don't give a damn.
You live off of people's ignorance.
You know that nothing can be done about it.
You create smoke, so people won't know what's right and what's wrong.
And you can do whatever the fuck you want!
But I'm not afraid of you!
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid!
I'm not afraid!
You're already studying.
- Hi.
- Hi, good morning.
Is Lisa still sleeping
No, she's awake.
- The door is shut.
- It's because of the light.
She keeps it shut because light penetrates inside when it's open.
- It's for the photos...
- Again?
Enough with the photos, ok?
I'm going to pick up Queequeg.
- Really?
- Tell her.
Do you have to go out?
I took the keys.
Not me.
- We should pay Amalia...
- Shitalia is here?
!
She'll hear you.
She's right underneath.
So what, it's affectionate...
It's not that...
I'll leave the money on the nightstand.
Study well.
He really had no reason to, on the contrary.
Oh, come on...
Yes, yes...
He went with a little girl!
PENAL CODE
I had to what?
!
Look, I don't want to discuss it.
The day hasn't even started yet, so...
Ok, give me the number.
Yes...
Yes, yes...
Yes, bye.
Poor idiot...
- Did uoy kool edistuo?
- No.
Look out the window.
Mum went to pick up Queequeg.
- Yes.
I saw that she...
- The brace?
You got rid of it?
Yes, I can't wear it anymore.
- Damn it's cold!
- Close it.
Cool!
We weren't on these terms...
So...
If he finds a lawyer that can promise him...
It means that they're proposing something stupid, because there's...
I'm not at all convinced...
I'm...
Hallo?
Hallo?
Hallo?
What is it?
It's the servant...
Lisa!
What's going on?
Mum...
I'll go look for mum.
Stay calm...
Calm.
Dad, don't go out.
Don't go!
Try the cellphone.
Shouldn't we pick up... the thing below?
No signal...
No signal.
The radio...
Dad...
Dad, I'm afraid.
- What was it?
- Nothing, it was...
Nothing, she's just afraid.
A nightmare?
No, she wasn't even sleeping.
- What should we do?
- I don't know, Tommaso.
- We can't stay here.
- And where should we go?
How can we get out?
Haven't you seen the Padovano's?
If we get inside the car?
We could go to our grandparents.
As soon as this...
I'm cold.
Take a blanket.
Give her a blanket.
- Go and take...
- I'm cold too.
Take a sweater.
Bring one for me too.
It's cold.
It's colder.
There's no power.
There's...
In my study...
Can you get there?
There's an emergency lamp.
I turned it off to save power.
- Dad, what should we do?
- I don't know, Tommaso.
- Don't worry.
- Lisa is not speaking...
She doesn't say a thing.
She looked at me and screamed.
Tommaso...
Don't leave me.
Dad!
No, no, we're here.
We're here.
What is this?
- I hear a...
- Me too.
It's the bells.
- Do you hear?
It's the bells.
- Yes, it's those...
- The church.
- Yes.
Saint Patrizio...
There's somebody in the church.
Of course!
It must be the priest.
The big guy...
What was his name?
You know, the one...
The one people say is a drunk!
Couldn't it be that it's just the wind swinging them?
- No.
- No...
They're too heavy, it's impossible...
- ...
I think.
If not...
- You think?
Elisabetta, I'm not the bell maker or the priest.
But there's no wind.
If there was it would clear...
Why is he ringing?
To let people know someone's there?
To draw attention...
Yes.
It's like with the whistle, like shipwreck surivors, to draw...
Yes, right.
They're calling for someone to pick them up.
They must've heard that they organized...
They don't see us because of the...
Help!
Maybe it was just to give a bit of hope to the people.
Settled.
Now we won't see...
And... the servant...
- Did you hear a...
- No.
You?
No, everything's the same.
Nothing can be heard.
And with this noise...
Earlier, I thought I heard, from there...
like voices.
Why doesn't it raise away?
What is it?
I don't see anything.
And if she's still alive?
I don't hear anything.
There were noises before.
I heard the dog again.
From the living room?
- Yes.
- I heard that too.
The owners must be...
But there are... dogs, birds... cats.
It doesn't affect him.
I read on the internet that they were trying out a chemical that doesn't dissolve after it makes contact with the air.
That it takes a lot of time for it to dissolve.
- Where did you read it?
- On the internet.
I can't remember, it was a military thing.
They had to try it out here of all the places.
With all the remote villages that there are.
Listen, I have to... use the bucket?
Yes.
Maybe you'll have to...
Who used it last?
I didn't empty it the last time.
- Wait, I'll...
- I'll do it.
I'll do it.
The next time...
Remember that the next time...
We'll take turns.
Have you noticed the insects near the trash bin?
Is Queequeg's net preventing them from coming up?
Yes, don't worry.
This is good!
We should remember the brand for...
- Finished?
- Yes.
Samantha!
Samantha!
There's a dog.
That's good for you.
Go, because today...
What's going on?
Who are you?
Are you alone?
Are there others?
No, just us three.
Do it...
Eat.
Aren't you hungry?
Are you the rescue team?
